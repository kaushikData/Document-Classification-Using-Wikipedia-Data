      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2737">'''Albert Julius Meyer''' (14 May 1919 &amp;ndash; 31 October 1983) was an [[United States|American]] [[economist]] who taught at [[Harvard University]] for 28 years.  Meyers specialized in the economies of the [[Middle East]].

Meyer was born in [[Hawarden, Iowa|Hawarden]], [[Iowa]]. obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts|bachelors]] and [[master's degree]]s at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]].  In 1947 he received his [[doctorate]] from [[Johns Hopkins University]].  Among his seminal papers was "Entrepreneurship the missing link in the Arab states?"&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Albert J. (1954) "Entrepreneurship the missing link in the Arab states?" ''Middle East Economic Papers'' 1954: pp. 121-132&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1955, he started teaching at Harvard.  While at Harvard he produced two major books:
* ''Middle Eastern Capitalism: Nine essays'' (1959)&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Albert J. (1959) ''Middle Eastern Capitalism: Nine essays'' Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass., {{OCLC|228160}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 
* ''The Economy of Cyprus'' (1962)&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Albert J. (1962) ''The Economy of Cyprus'' Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass., {{OCLC|228160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myers was chief of mission for the Special U.S. Economic Mission to [[Saudi Arabia]], June 13–30, 1962, that led to closer U.S. ties with the kingdom.

The '''Albert Road gas holder''' in [[New Barnet]], north London, is a disused [[gas holder]] on the site of the former [[New Barnet Gas Works]] with a capacity of 2,000,000 cubic feet of gas. It was built for the Barnet &amp; District Gas and Water Company and came into use in 1934. It was decommissioned around 2009.

==Site==
The holder is to the east of Albert Road on the north part of the former New Barnet Gas Works site adjacent to Victoria Park, Barnet.

The site was opened for the [[East Barnet Gas and Water Company]] (formed 1866) which in 1872 took over two local gas companies and became the Barnet &amp; District Gas and Water Company. The company was nationalised in 1949 and became part of the Eastern Gas Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/rd/9fe646fe-b8be-43ec-8aa7-10f006d1ac7d BARNET DISTRICT GAS AND WATER COMPANY.] National Archives.

Retrieved 14 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; but plans for housing and a supermarket were not approved and they sold the area to the [[social housing]] provider [[One Housing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/news/view/development-planned-for-barnet-gas-works-site Development planned for Barnet gas works site.] ''theconstructionindex'', 8 January 2016. Retrieved 14 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The holder==
Gas holders have been present on the southern part of the site since at least the 1890s but the current, and last remaining, holder was not brought into use until 1934. It is column-guided with four concentric lifts and a capacity of 2,000,000 cubic feet of gas. After the exploitation of [[North Sea Gas]] began in the 1960s the gas works on the rest of the site was demolished and a high pressure pipeline installed with the remaining holder retained just for low pressure storage to cope with [[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]] peak demand on the system.&lt;ref name=barn&gt;[https://barnet.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s19943/Land%20formerly%20known%20as%20British%20Gas%20PLC%20Eastern%20Barnet%20Holder%20Station%20Albert%20Road%20New%20Barnet%20Lo.pdf B/04148/14.] [[London Borough of Barnet]], 2014.

The '''Ap Lei Chau Power Station''' ({{zh|c=鴨脷洲發電廠}}) was an oil-fired [[power station]] in [[Ap Lei Chau]], [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industrialhistoryhk.org/hong-kong-electric-company-1890-decommissioning-lei-chau-power-station-1989/|last=Farmer|first=Hugh|date=9 July 2015|title=The Hong Kong Electric Company – 1889 to the decommissioning of Ap Lei Chau Power station in 1989|publisher=The Industrial History of Hong Kong Group|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The power station was commissioned in 1968 and was the largest power station in British Hong Kong at that time. The power station was decommissioned starting in 1984 and eventually closed in 1989. Its generators were then moved to [[Lamma Power Station]]. The area around the power station is now surrounded by the [[South Horizons]] residential area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hiphing.com.hk/en/projects/details.php?id=108|title=Ap Lei Chau Power Station|publisher=Hip Hing Construction|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generation==
The power station provided electricity to the western area of Hong Kong.

'''BRABUS GmbH''', founded 1977 in [[Bottrop]] ([[Ruhr Area]]), [[Germany]], is a high-performance [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] [[Car tuning|tuning]] company which specializes in [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Smart (marque)|Smart]] and [[Maybach]] vehicles. Brabus became the largest Mercedes tuner, other than [[Mercedes-AMG]] which became a [[DaimlerChrysler]] affiliate in the 1990s.

==History==
The company began with Bodo Buschmann wanting to customize his cars, but discovered most existing customizers could not meet his thought or requirement, so he decided to start his own brand. After Buschmann had decided to start his own brand, BRABUS GmbH was originally registered in 1977 at Germany with Buschmann's friend Klaus Brackman because German law required a company must be established with at least two people. The company name was derived from the first three characters of the founders' surnames ('''Bra'''ckman, '''Bus'''chmann). Following the company's foundation, Brackman did not show interests in modifying vehicles or running a business, so he sold his company shares to Buschmann for 100 euros.&lt;ref&gt;[http://am.u-car.com.tw/17306.html 惡魔奔馳秀－Brabus改裝廠巡禮(上)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, BRABUS GmbH had started building its third factory in Bottrop.&lt;Ref&gt;[https://www.derwesten.de/staedte/bottrop/automobiltuner-brabus-baut-drittes-werk-in-bottrop-id7200130.html Automobiltuner Brabus baut drittes Werk in Bottrop]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
Brabus's primary focus is to achieve maximum engine performance through the increase of horsepower and [[torque]]. Customers can either buy cars from Brabus, or send in their car to be customized and/or overhauled. Customers ordering a car directly involves Brabus purchasing a particular model from Mercedes and then modifying it according to the customer's requests. Brabus is known for providing expensive tuning and custom solutions.

Brabus also offers cosmetic modifications including low profile spoilers, bodykits, [[carbon fiber]] splitters, and multi-piece alloy wheels. Other upgrades include racing [[limited slip differential|LSDs]], open racing exhaust systems, twelve-piston disc brakes, and engine remapping. Customers can also have complete engine overhauls, or have new crate engines from [[Mercedes-AMG|AMG]] modified for them.

Brabus engines range from small {{convert|200|hp}} K4 blocks for [[Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class|SLK roadsters]] and [[Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class (C209)|CLK-Class]] to the {{convert|900|hp}} [[twin-turbo]] blocks for the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|S-Class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.emercedesbenz.com/Feb09/19_001596_Geneva_Motor_Show_With_Preview_The_BRABUS_G_V12_S_Biturbo_Mercedes_Benz_G_Class.html |title=Geneva Motor Show Preview: The BRABUS G V12 S Biturbo Mercedes-Benz G-Class &amp;#124; eMercedesBenz - The Unofficial Mercedes-Benz Weblog |publisher=eMercedesBenz |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also provides improvements to the interior from custom upholstery, gauges, shiftknobs, pedals, and trim to various electronics such as wider [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screens for the [[Maybach]].

[[Image:Cooling curve.png|thumb|A cooling curve of naphthalene from liquid to solid.]]

A '''cooling curve''' is a line [[graphics|graph]] that represents the change of [[Phase (matter)|phase]] of [[matter]], typically from a gas to a solid or a liquid to a solid. The [[independent variable]] (X-axis) is time and the [[dependent variable]] (Y-axis) is temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, Nibler, and Shoemaker. Experiments in Physical Chemistry (7th ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Below is an example of a cooling curve used in [[casting]]s.

[[File:Cooling curve pure metal.svg|500px]]

The initial point of the graph is the starting temperature of the matter, here noted as the "pouring temperature". When the phase change occurs there is a "thermal arrest", that is the temperature stays constant. This is because the matter has more [[internal energy]] as a liquid or gas than in the state that it is cooling to. The amount of energy required for a phase change is known as [[latent heat]]. The "cooling rate" is the slope of the cooling curve at any point.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6501">The '''Dvararvati Sila''' is a type of [[Sila (murthi)|Sila]] or coral stone obtained from the [[Gomati River (Gujarat)|Gomati river]] (Gomti River) in [[Dwarka|Dvaraka]]. Dvaraka is located in the Jamnagar District of [[Gujarat]] at the mouth of the Gomati River as it debouches into the [[Gulf of Kutch]]. The city lies in the westernmost part of [[India]]. In ancient Sanskrit literature Dvaraka was called Dvarawati and was rated as one of the seven most [[prehistoric]] cities in the country. Thus, the Sila or the stone obtained at the mouth of the Gomati river is called the Dvaravati Sila and is worshipped. 

Dvaraka Silas are coral with chakra (wheel) markings and the chakra-mark is the most distinguishing feature of these stones, and hence they are called ‘chakrankita-sila’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shaligram.com/dwarka-pages/dwarkaintro2.php The Shaligram stone is also known as salagram shila or saligram stone or shalagram&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrojyoti.com/dwarakashila.htm Dwaraka Sila&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Aniconic  representation]] of God is by a symbol rather than an image. Indian art overwhelmingly prefers the iconic image, but some [[aniconism]] does occur in folk worship, in early [[Hinduism]] in the form of [[Vishnu]]'s [[Shaligram|Saligrama]] [[Sila (murthi)]] (fossil stone), Dvaravati Sila (coral stone), [[Govardhana Sila]] (stone from the [[Govardhan hill]]),  etc. They have solar significance, and their use in worship is very common among all sects of [[Vaishnavite]]s of [[Hindu]] religion.

== Dvaraka ==
The legendary city of [[Dvārakā|Dvaraka]] in [[Hindu]] history was the dwelling place of [[Krishna]]. Dwarka or Dvaraka is derived from 'Dwar', a door, and in ancient times its flourishing port was considered to be the gateway to the main land. As 'Ka' means 'Brahma' meaning gateway to Moksha (salvation). It is also called Dwarkamati and Dwarkavati or Dvaravati. The famous Nageswar Jyotirlinga near Dwaraka is made of a large Dwaraka Sila.

The Hindu scriptures prescribe that stones obtained from Dvaraka only for worship even though geologically it may be found in other places too.

== Scriptural sanctions==

There are several schools of thought among the learned [[acharyas]] of the [[Vaishnava]] sect on the worship of this Sila. This Sila is worshipped, along with or independent of [[Sila (murthi)]] or Saligrama Sila, in some parts of the country (among [[Vaishnavites]] of Saurashtra, Bengal and Maharashtra; the [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] sect in Karnataka), particularly in the Vaishnava tradition. It is worshipped along with the [[Sila (murthi)|Sila]]| Saligrama Sila (stone) since scriptures consider it auspicious to do so. According to [[Skanda Purana]], wherever Dvaraka Sila is placed in front of the [[Sila (murthi)|Sila]]|, every class of magnificence goes on increasing unlimitedly. Skanda Purana also says that one who daily worships Dvaraka Sila along with twelve Saligrama Silas will be honored even in Vaikuntha. 

===Traits===
The chakra-mark is the most distinguishing feature of the Dvaravati stones, and hence they are called "chakrankita-sila". According to [[Garuda Purana]], there are twelve varieties of this stone, owing to the number of chakras (wheels), colours and forms (Sanskrit sloka in this regard states:‘dasadha cha prabhinnas ta varnakrti-vibhedatah’). When there is only one chakra, the stone is called Devesa; when there are two chakras, it is Sudarshana; three chakras represent the deity Ananta.  When there are four chakras, the stone is Janardana. [[Vasudeva]] is represented by the stone having five chakras, Pradyumna by six chakras, Bala-bhadra by seven, Purushottama by eight, Nava-vyuha by nine, Dasavatara by ten, Aniruddha by eleven and Dvadastma by twelve. Nava-vyuha represents the collection of nine forms of [[Vishnu]]: Vasudeva, Samkarshana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, [[Narayana]], [[Hayagriva]], [[Vishnu]], [[Nrsimha]] and [[Varaha]]. The first four forms are well known as ‘chatur-vyuha’. The twelve major forms of [[Vishnu]] are derived from these nine forms, according to the Tantra siddhanta, a division of [[Pancharatra]]. 

Prahlada Samhita, quoted in Salagrama-pariksha (by Anupasimha) gives the first few names differently. The Dvaravati Sila with only one chakra is called Sudarsana, with two chakras 'Lakshmi-narayana' and with three chkras 'Trivikrama'. The rest of the names are the same as given above. The name Ananta is given to stones which have more than twelve chakras. The name for Dasavatara in the above list is given here as 'Dasamurti'. When the chakras are more than twelve, only even numbered chakras are to be preferred, according to Galava-smrtir.

===Benefits===
These Silas also have distinct personalities like the Saligrama Sila that are identified by their size, colure, texture markings; these are explained below.

I.Sudarshana: one chakra - salvation 

II.Lakshmi-Narayana: two chakras- salvation
 
III.Trivikrama: three chakras - freedom from the fear of births and deaths

The cultural perspective on [[Earth]], or the [[world]], varies by society and time period. Religious beliefs often include a creation belief as well as personification in the form of a [[deity]]. The exploration of the world has modified many of the perceptions of the planet, resulting in a viewpoint of a globally integrated [[ecosystem]]. Unlike the remainder of the planets in the [[Solar System]], mankind didn't perceive the Earth as a planet until the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Unlike the other planets in the Solar System, in English, Earth does not directly share a name with an ancient Roman deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Planetary symbol==
[[File:Earth symbol.svg|thumb|200px|right|Astronomical symbol of Earth]]
{{main|Earth symbol}}
The standard [[astronomical symbol]] of the Earth consists of a cross circumscribed by a circle. This symbol is known as the wheel cross, sun cross, Odin's cross or Woden's cross. Although it has been used in various cultures for different purposes, it came to represent the compass points, earth and the land. Another version of the symbol is a cross on top of a circle; a stylized [[globus cruciger]] that was also used as an early astronomical symbol for the planet Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Religious beliefs==
[[File:Bhudevi.jpg|thumb|The Hindu Earth goddess]]
Earth has often been personified as a [[deity]], in particular a [[goddess]]. In many cultures the [[mother goddess]] is also portrayed as a [[Fertility god|fertility deity]]. To the [[Aztec]], Earth was called [[Tonantzin]]&amp;mdash;"our mother"; to the [[Incas]], Earth was called [[Pachamama]]&amp;mdash;"mother earth". The Chinese Earth goddess [[Hou Tu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=E. T. C. | last=Werner | year=1922 | title=Myths &amp; Legends of China | publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd. | location=New York | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15250 | accessdate=2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the Greek goddess personifying the Earth. To [[Hindu]]s it is called [[Bhuma Devi]], the Goddess of Earth. (See also [[Graha]].) The [[Tuluva]] people of [[Tulunadu]] in Southern India celebrate a Three Day "Earth Day" called [[Keddaso]]. This festival comes in usually on 10th,12th,13 February every Calendar year. In [[Norse mythology]], the Earth giantess [[Jörð]] was the mother of [[Thor]] and the daughter of [[Annar]]. [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Ancient Egyptian mythology]] is different from that of other cultures because Earth is male, [[Geb]], and sky is female, [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]].

[[Creation myth]]s in many [[religion]]s recall a story involving the creation of the world by a supernatural [[deity]] or deities. A variety of religious groups, often associated with [[fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] branches of [[Protestantism]]&lt;ref name=Dutch2002&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dutch, S.I. | year = 2002 | title = Religion as belief versus religion as fact | journal = Journal of Geoscience Education | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–144 | url=http://nagt.org/files/nagt/jge/abstracts/Dutch_v50n2p137.pdf | accessdate = 2008-04-28|format=PDF| bibcode = 2002JGeEd..50..137D | doi = 10.5408/1089-9995-50.2.137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Islam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Taner Edis | authorlink = Taner Edis | year = 2003 | title = A World Designed by God: Science and Creationism in Contemporary Islam | publisher = Amherst: Prometheus | url = http://www2.truman.edu/~edis/writings/articles/CFI-2001.pdf | isbn = 1-59102-064-6 | accessdate = 2008-04-28 | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080527192629/http://www2.truman.edu/~edis/writings/articles/CFI-2001.pdf | archivedate = 2008-05-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; assert that their [[Hermeneutics|interpretations]] of the accounts of creation in [[religious text|sacred texts]] are [[Creation science|literal truth]] and should be considered alongside or replace conventional scientific accounts of the formation of the Earth and the origin and development of life.&lt;ref name=Ross2005&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ross, M.R. | year = 2005 | title = Who Believes What?

==Physical form==
In the ancient past there were varying levels of belief in a [[flat Earth]], with the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Mesopotamian]] culture portraying the world as a flat disk afloat in an ocean. The spherical form of the Earth was suggested by early [[Greek philosophers]]; a belief espoused by [[Pythagoras]]. By the [[Middle Ages]]&amp;mdash;as evidenced by thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]&amp;mdash;European belief in a [[spherical Earth]] was widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Russell | first = Jeffrey B. | url = http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/history/1997Russell.html | title = The Myth of the Flat Earth | publisher = American Scientific Affiliation | accessdate = 2007-03-14 }}; but see also [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern perspective==
The technological developments of the latter half of the 20th century are widely considered to have altered the public's perception of the Earth. Before space flight, the popular image of Earth was of a green world. [[Science fiction]] artist [[Frank R. Paul]] provided perhaps the first image of a cloudless ''blue'' planet (with sharply defined land masses) on the back cover of the July 1940 issue of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', a common depiction for several decades thereafter.&lt;ref name="fja"&gt;

The crew of the [[Apollo 8]] was the first to view an Earth-rise from lunar orbit in 1968. In 1972 the crew of the [[Apollo 17]] produced the famous ''[[The Blue Marble|Blue Marble]]'' photograph of the planet Earth from [[cislunar space]]. This became an iconic image of the planet as a marble of cloud-swirled blue ocean broken by green-brown continents. NASA archivist Mike Gentry has speculated that ''The Blue Marble'' is the most widely distributed image in human history. Inspired by ''[[The Blue Marble]]'' poet-diplomat [[Abhay K]] has penned an [[Earth Anthem]] describing the planet as a "Cosmic Blue Pearl".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2013/05/24/related_articles/voices/249135.html An Anthem for the Earth] Kathmandu Post, May 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A photo taken of a distant Earth by ''[[Voyager 1]]'' in 1990 inspired [[Carl Sagan]] to describe the planet as a "[[Pale Blue Dot]]."&lt;ref name="seti-pbd"&gt;

==Evolution of electric vehicles==
[[File:Electric Rickshaws.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Electric Rickshaws in [[Lumbini]], [[Nepal]]]]
The [[electric automobile]] did not easily develop into a viable means of [[transportation]]. Research waned from 1920-1960 until environmental issues of pollution and diminishing natural resources reawakened the need of a more environmentally friendly means of transportation. Technologies that support a reliable battery and the weight of the needed number of batteries elevated the price of making an electric vehicle.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Whitener, Barbara. The Electric Car Book. Louisville, KY: Love Street Books, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1837, [[Robert Davidson (inventor)|Robert Davidson]] of Scotland appears to have been the builder of the first electric car, but it wasn't until the 1890s that electric cars were manufactured and sold in Europe and America. During the late 1890s, United States roads were populated by more electric automobiles than those with [[internal combustion engine]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Shacket, Sheldon R. The Complete Book of Electric Vehicles. Northbrook, IL: Domus Books, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and construction==
[[File:Electric trikes overwhelm Comilla streets.jpg|thumb|200px|Customized electric rickshaws in [[Comilla]], [[Bangladesh]]]]

These rickshaws have a M.S(Mild Steel) tubular [[Chassi]]s, consist of 3 wheels with a differential mechanism at rear wheels. The motor is brushless DC motor manufactured mostly in India and China. The electrical system used in Indian version is 48V and Bangladesh is 60V. The body design from most popular Chinese version is of very thin iron or aluminum sheets. Vehicles made in fiber are also popular because of their strength and durability, resulting in low maintenance, especially in India. Body design is varied from load carriers, passenger vehicles with no roof, to full body with windshield for drivers comfort&lt;ref name="madehow.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-5/Electric-Automobile.html|title=How electric automobile is made - material, manufacture, making, history, used, parts, components, steps, product|publisher=|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consist of a controller unit.They are sold on the basis of [[voltage]] supplied and [[Electric current|current]] output, also the number of [[mosfet]](metal oxide field effect transistor) used. The battery used is mostly [[lead acid battery]] with life of 6–12 months. [[Deep discharge batteries]] designed for electric vehicles are rarely used. Weight of the electric car has also been a recurring design difficulty in them.&lt;ref name="madehow.com"/&gt;

==Types==

===Load carriers===
These are load carrying versions of these rickshaws differ in their upper body, load carrying capacity, motor power, controller and other structural aspects, sometimes motor power is also increased in order to carry loads up to 500–1000&amp;nbsp;kg.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Solar===
{{tone|date=June 2017}}
There are two types of solar vehicles:
* '''Directly solar-powered''' - fitted with [[solar panel]]s. A directly solar-powered rickshaw is an electric auto rickshaw driven solely by one or more [[electric motor]]s, powered by solar panels mounted on the vehicle and capable of operating while the vehicle is in motion. Theoretically, solar panels could provide power directly to the motor(s) without the need for batteries, but in reality this would be an improbable design choice for a rickshaw, given its intended purpose. In e-rickshaws, however solar panels are not effective and are not frequently used.{{Original research inline|date=June 2017}}

In practice, the term ''solar rickshaw'' is most commonly used to describe [[Battery electric vehicle|battery-electric]] rickshaws whose batteries are indirectly solar-charged (i.e. independently from the vehicle) prior to use. This is usually facilitated by removing batteries in need of charging from the vehicle, and exchanging them for batteries which have already been charged. Alternatively, batteries can be charged [[in-situ]] while the vehicle is parked, although this may limit daytime usage. The exact same battery replacement and in-situ methods are of course also used for non-'solar' batteries and vehicles.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Popularity==
Electric rickshaw are most popular in Asia. The low cost Chinese version being the first to show up on streets. They are mostly used in China, India, Bangladesh and Nepal, also in low numbers other parts of Asia they have been showing up. China, Japan, India, and European countries (Switzerland, France, Germany) have researched and developed electric tricycles for commercial transport and are attempting to capture the growing market in Asia. Government has made efforts though to run them and made plans to issue licences on a fee of 1.5tk but there has been no action on this matter to date.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

===Bangladesh===
Bangladesh imports electric rickshaws directly from China or via other countries, the well established cities prefer them as cheaper and better means of transport. The government in an inter-ministerial meeting on May 5 banned import and assembly of the vehicles and decided to send off-road those already plying, primarily on the ground that it consumes electricity mostly through illegal connections.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

===China===
[[File:Auto-rickshaw in Haikou - 02.jpg|thumb|right|An electric rickshaw in [[Haikou]], Hainan, China]]

China is the largest manufacturer of electric rickshaws in the world, due to low labor cost, high production rates and encouraging government policies on foreign trade they import a large number on daily basis. There are hundreds of electric rickshaw manufacturers and thousands of parts producers. and now main market for small city or town which bus is not popular.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===India===

One of the first attempt to design electric rickshaws was done by [[Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute]] in late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8cbe/f2ba2ab2dc328140d3bbb8444624239ae413.pdf Electric cycle rickshaws as a sustainable transport system]&lt;/ref&gt; They modified the cycle rickshaw and then converted to an electric one. In India they are popularly known as e-rickshaws and are widely spread all over India. They started to gain popularity in India since 2011.The design is now much different from cycle rickshaws. They have provided with service to city and has also contribution in providing livelihood to people in India.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/states/cheap-rides-low-costs-its-tuktuk-time-in-tripura/article5690150.ece|title=Cheap rides, low costs: it’s Tuk-Tuk time in Tripura|first=Pratim Ranjan|last=Bose|date=14 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their low cost and high efficiency they are accepted on the Indian streets,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; but government policies have been threatening the e-rickshaw and banned them in the capital city Delhi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/govt-stops-sale-of-erickshaws/1040561/|title=Govt stops sale of e-rickshaws - Indian Express|publisher=|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to increase in number failed to put them off the streets. They are still widely used in Delhi and other parts of India. In Delhi, as per government official's figures in April 2012, the number was over 100,000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Industry/vGQ4bqUDEnQZtTeSOwRsBP/India-chases-electric-mobility-dream.html|title=Industry|first=By Nikita|last=Mehta,|date=6 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India almost all claimed to be manufacturing the vehicle are merely importing it from China and assembling them.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; Though the manufacturers in India are less in number, manufacturers claim that in the vehicle production is less and cost is a little at higher but they offer higher quality products&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; and also offer services and warranty, these manufacturers market the product as an Indian make and are also popular because of uniqueness in their product and providing a branded better quality product.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

The FRP body e-rickshaws are also popular in India and are manufactured in India due to high shipment cost from China they are cheaper to Indian manufacturers, where a Chinese version of FRP Rickshaw will cost 1.5 times more than an Indian make.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;

There are issues with services due to lack of established companies and just about everyone importing and selling them from China, resulting in problems to their customers, this is the reason consumers have started gaining knowledge and prefer more durable versions from well-established companies and Indian manufacturers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

====E-rickshaw law in India====
Initially e-rickshaws were unregulated by any central law in India. However, the [[Delhi High Court]], banned running of e-rickshaws in Delhi on 31 July 2014, over safety concerns raised through a public interest litigation.&lt;ref name=epw&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harding|first1=Simon|last2=Rojesh|first2=Seram|title=Battery Rickshaws in New Delhi and the Regulation Conundrum|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=31 August 2014|volume=XLIX|issue=35|url=http://www.epw.in/insight/battery-rickshaws-new-delhi-and-regulation-conundrum.html|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a rally held for regularization of e rickshaws in Delhi transport minister Nitin Gadkari said that "municipal corporations would regularize e-rickshaws by registering them for a fee of just Rs.100. After registering the e-rickshaw, corporations will have to issue identity cards to drivers so they can earn their livelihood easily."&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/36809384.cms|title=Municipal corporations to frame policy on e-rickshaws in a month's time|publisher=|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the policy was in place, the corporation, along with [[traffic police]], would have fix the amount of fine to be imposed for violation of the policy.&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"/&gt; However, the policy was never implemented. Certain states like [[Tripura]] had regularised the e-rickshaws through municipal bylaws or through state legislation.&lt;ref name=epw /&gt; In March 2015, the Indian Parliament passed an amendment to the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2015 legalizing E-Rickshaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cppr.in/article/e-rickshaw-bill-passed-need-celebrate/|title=E-Rickshaw Bill Passed|date=10 March 2015|publisher=|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2015 Battery Rickshaw are available for travel in many cities, now certified to ply with Registration No. plate by R.T.O. with insurance.

'''Emulsifying wax''' is a [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] [[emulsion|emulsifying]] ingredient. The ingredient name is often followed by the initials NF, indicating that it conforms to the specifications of the [[National Formulary]].

Emulsifying wax is created when a [[wax]] material (either a vegetable wax of some kind or a petroleum-based wax) is treated with a [[detergent]] (typically [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] or [[polysorbate]]s) to cause it to make oil and water bind together into a smooth emulsion. It is a white waxy solid with a low fatty alcohol odor.

The ingredients for Emulsifying Wax NF are: Cetearyl Alcohol, and a polyoxyethylene derivative of a fatty acid ester of sorbitan (a polysorbate).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmacopeia.cn/v29240/usp29nf24s0_m88980.html] Emulsifying Wax (US Pharmacopeia)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a cosmetic product, if the emulsifying wax used meets the standards for the National Formulary, it may be listed in the ingredient declaration by the term "emulsifying wax NF".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2014-title21-vol7/xml/CFR-2014-title21-vol7-sec701-3.xml] 21 CFR 701.3(c)(2)(iii)&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise, the emulsifier is considered a blended ingredient and the individual components must be listed individually in the ingredient declaration, placed appropriately in descending order of predominance in the whole.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/labeling/regulations/ucm126444.htm#clgl3] Cosmetic Labeling Manual - Order of Declaration (FDA)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31104">'''Energy conservation''' is the effort made to reduce the [[energy consumption|consumption of energy]] by using less of an energy service. This can be achieved either by [[efficient energy use|using energy more efficiently]] (using less energy for a constant service) or by reducing the amount of service used (for example, by driving less). Energy conservation is a part of the concept of [[eco-sufficiency]]. Energy conservation reduces the need for energy services and can result in increased [[natural environment|environmental]] quality, [[national security]], [[personal security|personal financial security]] and higher savings.&lt;ref name="zehner-2011"&gt;

Energy can be conserved by reducing wastage and losses, improving efficiency through technological upgrades and improved operation and maintenance. On a global level energy use can also be reduced by the stabilisation of [[population growth]].

Energy can only be transformed from one form to other, such as heat energy to motive power in cars, or kinetic energy of water flow to electricity in hydroelectric power plants. However machines are required to transform energy from one form to other. The wear and friction of the components of these machine while running cause loss of quadrillions of BTU and $500 billions in industries only in USA. It is possible to minimize these losses by adopting green engineering practices to improve life cycle of the components.(Ref.R.Chattopadhyay:Green Tribology, Green Surface Engineering and Global Warming', ASM International,USA, 2014. Also  3 books by same author published earlier on wear, surface engineering and global warming.)

==Energy tax==
Some countries employ [[energy tax|energy]] or [[carbon taxes]] to motivate energy users to reduce their consumption. Carbon taxes can force consumption to shift to nuclear power and other energy sources that carry different sets of environmental side effects and limitations. On the other hand, taxes on all energy consumption can reduce energy use across the board while reducing a broader array of environmental consequences arising from energy production. The state of California employs a tiered energy tax whereby every consumer receives a baseline energy allowance that carries a low tax. As usage increases above that baseline, the tax increases drastically. Such programs aim to protect poorer households while creating a larger tax burden for high energy consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln and London|pages=179–182|url=http://greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building design==
[[File:Light_switch_with_passive_infrared_sensor.jpg|100px|thumb|right|[[Occupancy sensor]]s can conserve energy by turning off appliances in unoccupied rooms.&lt;ref name="calif"&gt;{{cite web |title=Guest Room Occupancy Controls—2013 California Building Energy Efficiency Standards |authors=Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison |date=2011 |publisher=[[California Energy Commission]] |url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/title24/2013standards/prerulemaking/documents/current/Reports/Nonresidential/Lighting_Controls_Bldg_Power/2013_CASE_NR_Guest_Room_Occupancy_Controls_Oct_2011.pdf |accessdate=May 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
One of the primary ways to improve energy conservation in buildings is to perform an [[energy audit]]. An energy audit is an [[inspection]] and analysis of energy use and flows for energy conservation in a building, process or system with an eye toward reducing energy input without negatively affecting output. This is normally accomplished by trained professionals and can be part of some of the national programs discussed above. Recent development of [[smartphone]] apps enables homeowners to complete relatively sophisticated energy audits themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Leslie, Joshua Pearce, Rob Harrap, Sylvie Daniel, "[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1478646X.2011.578746 The application of smartphone technology to economic and environmental analysis of building energy conservation strategies]", ''International Journal of Sustainable Energy'' '''31'''(5), pp. 295–311 (2012). [https://www.academia.edu/2101401/The_application_of_smartphone_technology_to_economic_and_environmental_analysis_of_building_energy_conservation_strategies open access]&lt;/ref&gt;

Building technologies and smart meters can allow energy users, both commercial and residential, to visualize the impact their energy use can have in their workplace or homes. Advanced real-time energy metering can help people save energy by their actions.&lt;ref&gt;July 2009 European Commission's Directorate-General for Energy and Transport initiative, "Energy Savings from Intelligent Metering and Behavioural Change (INTELLIGENT METERING) http://www.managenergy.net/products/R1951.htm", 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Illust passive solar d1.gif|thumb|left|right|Elements of passive solar design, shown in a direct gain application]]
In [[passive solar building design]], windows, walls, and floors are made to collect, store, and distribute [[solar energy]] in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer. This is called passive solar design or climatic design because, unlike active [[solar heating]] systems, it does not involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices.

The key to designing a passive solar building is to best take advantage of the local [[climate]]. Elements to be considered include window placement and glazing type, [[thermal insulation]], [[thermal mass]], and shading. Passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings, but existing buildings can be retrofitted.

==Transportation==
{{See|Carfree_city}}
In the United States, suburban infrastructure evolved during an age of relatively easy access to fossil fuels, which has led to transportation-dependent systems of living. Zoning reforms that allow greater [[urban density]] as well as designs for walking and bicycling can greatly reduce energy consumed for transportation. The use of telecommuting by major corporations is a significant opportunity to conserve energy, as many Americans now work in service jobs that enable them to work from home instead of commuting to work each day.

==Consumer products==
[[File:Assorted LED Lamps.jpg|thumb|An assortment of energy-efficient semiconductor (LED) lamps for commercial and residential lighting use. LED lamps use at least 75% less energy, and last 25 times longer, than traditional incandescent light bulbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/led-lighting|title=LED Lighting – Department of Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Consumers are often poorly informed of the savings of energy efficient products.  A prominent example of this is the energy savings that can be made by replacing an [[incandescent light bulb]] with a more modern alternative.  When purchasing light bulbs, many consumers opt for cheap incandescent bulbs, failing to take into account their higher energy costs and lower lifespans when compared to modern [[compact fluorescent lamp|compact fluorescent]] and [[LED lamp|LED bulbs]].  Although these energy-efficient alternatives have a higher upfront cost, their long lifespan and low energy use can save consumers a considerable amount of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eenews.net/stories/1059993391|title=ENERGY EFFICIENCY: When will consumers realize the 60-cent light bulb wasn't a bargain?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price of LED bulbs has also been steadily decreasing in the past five years due to improvements in semiconductor technology.  Many LED bulbs on the market qualify for utility rebates that further reduce the price of purchase to the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/A-Boom-in-Utility-Rebates-Drives-LED-Lighting|title=A Boom in Utility Rebates Drives LED Lighting|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates by the U.S. Department of Energy state that widespread adoption of LED lighting over the next 20 years could result in about $265&amp;nbsp;billion worth of savings in United States energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerenergycenter.org/lighting/bulbs.html|title=Consumer Energy Center – Incandescent, LED, Fluorescent, Compact Fluorescent and Halogen Bulbs|first=California Energy|last=Commission|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120728221025/www.consumerenergycenter.org/lighting/bulbs.html|archivedate=28 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research one must put into conserving energy is often too time consuming and costly for the average consumer when there are cheaper products and technology available using today's fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11326549|title=Energy efficiency: The elusive negawatt|publisher=The Economist|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments and NGOs are attempting to reduce this complexity with [[ecolabel]]s that make differences in energy efficiency easy to research while shopping.&lt;ref&gt;Breukers, Heiskanen, et al. (2009). Interaction schemes for successful demand-side management. [http://www.energychange.info/deliverables Deliverable 5 of the CHANGING BEHAVIOUR] project. Funded by the EC (#213217)&lt;/ref&gt;

To provide the kind of information and support people need to invest money, time and effort in energy conservation, it is important to understand and link to people's topical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mechanisms.energychange.info/step-by-step/2 Toolkit for managers of energy conservation projects: How to learn about people's topical concerns] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820214753/http://mechanisms.energychange.info/step-by-step/2 |date=20 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, some retailers argue that bright [[lighting]] stimulates purchasing. However, health studies have demonstrated that headache, [[stress (medicine)|stress]], [[blood pressure]], fatigue and worker error all generally increase with the common [[over-illumination]] present in many workplace and retail settings.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Scott Davis |author2=Dana K.

In warm climates where air conditioning is used, any household device that gives off heat will result in a larger load on the cooling system. Items such as stoves, dish washers, clothes dryers, hot water and incandescent lighting all add heat to the home. Low-power or insulated versions of these devices give off less heat for the air conditioning to remove. The air conditioning system can also improve in efficiency by using a heat sink that is cooler than the standard air heat exchanger, such as geothermal or water.

In cold climates, heating air and water is a major demand on household energy use. Significant energy reductions are possible by using different technologies. [[Heat pump]]s are a more efficient alternative to electrical resistance heaters for warming air or water. A variety of efficient [[clothes dryer]]s are available, and the [[clothes line|clothes lines]] requires no energy- only time. Natural-gas [[condensing boiler]]s and hot-air furnaces increase efficiency over standard hot-flue models. New construction implementing [[heat exchanger]]s can capture heat from waste water or exhaust air in bathrooms, laundry and kitchens.

In both warm and cold climate extremes, airtight thermal [[Building insulation|insulated construction]] is the largest factor determining the efficiency of a home. Insulation is added to minimize the flow of heat to or from the home, but can be labor-intensive to retrofit to an existing home.

==Energy conservation by country==

===Asia===
Despite the vital role energy efficiency is expected to play in cost-effectively cutting energy demand, only a small part of its economic potential is exploited in the Asia. Governments have implemented a range of subsidies such as cash grants, cheap credit, tax exemptions, and co-financing with public-sector funds to encourage a range of energy-efficiency initiatives across several sectors. Governments in the Asia-Pacific region have implemented a range of information provision and labeling programs for buildings, appliances, and the transportation and industrial
sectors. Information programs can simply provide data, such as fuel-economy labels, or actively seek to encourage behavioral changes, such as Japan's [[Cool Biz campaign]] that encourages setting air conditioners at 28-degrees Celsius and allowing employees to dress casually in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=305#.UZEBZytARpE |title=2013 Pacific Energy Summit Working Papers |publisher=Nbr.org |date=22 April 2013 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=305#.UZEBZytARpE Pacific Energy Summit]&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
At the end of 2006, the [[European Union]] (EU) pledged to cut its annual consumption of primary energy by 20% by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/efficiency/index_en.htm |title=Energy: What do we want to achieve ? – European commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'European Union Energy Efficiency Action Plan' is long-awaited.

As part of the EU's SAVE Programme,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ademe.fr/partenaires/odyssee/pdf/save2000.pdf For an Energy-Efficient Millennium: SAVE 2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817005356/http://www.ademe.fr/partenaires/odyssee/pdf/save2000.pdf |date=17 August 2014 }}, Directorate-General for Energy&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at promoting energy efficiency and encouraging energy-saving behavior, the [[Boiler]] Efficiency Directive&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120716211211/http://europa.eu/eur-lex/en/consleg/main/1992/en_1992L0042_index.html Council Directive 92/42/EEC of 21 May 1992 on efficiency requirements for new hot-water boilers fired with liquid or gaseous fuels]&lt;/ref&gt; specifies minimum levels of efficiency for boilers utilizing liquid or gaseous fuels.

===India===
The [[Petroleum Conservation Research Association]] (PCRA) is an Indian governmental body created in 1978 that engages in promoting energy efficiency and conservation in every walk of life. In the recent past PCRA has done mass-media campaigns in television, radio, and print media. An impact-assessment survey by a third party revealed that due to these larger campaigns by PCRA, the public's overall awareness level has gone up leading to saving of fossil fuels worth crores of rupees, besides reducing pollution.

The [[Bureau of Energy Efficiency]] is an Indian government organization created in 2001 that is responsible for promoting energy efficiency and conservation.

===Japan===
[[File:03-05-JPN153.jpg|thumb|upright|'''Advertising with high energy in Shinjuku, Japan.''']]
Since the [[1973 oil crisis]], energy conservation has been an issue in Japan. All oil-based fuel is imported, so domestic [[sustainable energy]] is being developed.

The Energy Conservation Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaeec-col.eccj.or.jp/index.html Energy Conservation Center]&lt;/ref&gt; promotes energy efficiency in every aspect of Japan. Public entities are implementing the efficient use of energy for industries and research. It includes projects such as the Top Runner Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatepolicy.jp/thesis/pdf/09035dp.pdf Top Runner Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724162202/http://www.climatepolicy.jp/thesis/pdf/09035dp.pdf |date=24 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this project, new appliances are regularly tested on efficiency, and the most efficient ones are made the standard.

===Lebanon===
In Lebanon and since 2002 [[The Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation|The Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC)]] has been promoting the development of efficient and rational uses of energy and the use of renewable energy at the consumer level. It was created as a project financed by the International Environment Facility (GEF) and the Ministry of Energy Water (MEW) under the management of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and gradually established itself as an independent technical national center although it continues to be supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as indicated in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between MEW and UNDP on 18 June 2007.

===Nepal===

Until recently, [[Nepal]] has been focusing on the exploitation of its huge water resources to produce hydro power. Demand side management and energy conservation was not in the focus of government action. In 2009, bilateral Development Cooperation between Nepal and the Federal Republic of Germany, has agreed upon the joint implementation of "Nepal Energy Efficiency Programme". The lead executing agencies for the implementation are the Water and Energy Commission Secretariat (WECS). The aim of the programme is the promotion of energy efficiency in policy making, in rural and urban households as well as in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wecs-neep.gov.np/|title=Nepal Energy Efficiency Programme |year=2011|publisher=Water and Energy Commission Secretariat (WECS)|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the lack of a government organization that promotes energy efficiency in the country, the [[Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI)]] has established the Energy Efficiency Centre under his roof to promote energy conservation in the private sector. The Energy Efficiency Centre is a non-profit initiative that is offering energy auditing services to the industries. The Centre is also supported by Nepal Energy Efficiency Programme of [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eec-fncci.org/content-introduction |title=Introduction  |year=2013 |publisher=Energy Efficiency Centre |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A study conducted in 2012 found out that Nepalese industries could save 160,000 Megawatt hours of electricity and 8,000 Terajoule of thermal energy (like diesel, furnace oil and coal) every year. These savings are equivalent to annual energy cost cut of up to 6.4 Billion Nepalese Rupees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wecs-neep.gov.np/uploads/dcci_baseline_p_1343801352.pdf|title=Baseline Study of Selected Sector Industries to assess The Potentials for more Efficient use of Energy in Nepal |year=2016 |publisher=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) |accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/eecfncci/result-of-baseline-study-of-selected-sector-industries-to-assess-the-potentials-for-more-efficient-use-of-energy-in-nepal|title=Baseline Study of Selected Sector Industries to assess The Potentials for more Efficient use of Energy in Nepal |year=2012 |publisher=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) |accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result of Nepal Economic Forum 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ekantipur.com/2014/02/25/business/agri-tourism-energy-in-focus-at-nepal-economic-summit/385852.html |title=Agri, tourism, energy in focus at Nepal Economic Summit |year=2014 |publisher=Kantipur Newspaper|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an economic reform agenda in the priority sectors was declared focusing on energy conservation among others. In the energy reform agenda the government of Nepal gave the commitment to introduce incentive packages in the budget of the fiscal year 2015/16 for industries that practices energy efficiency or use efficient technologies (incl. cogeneration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bwc4pUn0CaBSZGxIRGVKRzVHTXc&amp;usp=sharing |title=NEPAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT 2014 DECLARATION – A COMMITMENT TO ECONOMIC REFORM |year=2014 |publisher=FNCCI |accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]] the [[Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority]] is the Government Agency responsible for promoting energy efficiency and conservation.  The '''''Energy Management Association of New Zealand''''' is a membership based organization representing the New Zealand energy services sector, providing training and accreditation services with the aim of ensuring energy management services are credible and dependable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gratis Energienota Scan {{!}} Jaararfrekening Energie|url=https://switchcollectief.nl/energienota/|accessdate=7 November 2016|work=switchCollectief.NL|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
In Nigeria, the Lagos State Government is encouraging Lagosians to imbibe an energy conservation culture. The Lagos State Electricity Board (LSEB)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lseb.gov.ng Lagos State Electricity Board (LSEB)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113114709/http://www.lseb.gov.ng/ |date=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is spearheading an initiative tagged "Conserve Energy, Save Money" under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. The initiative is designed to sensitize Lagosians around the theme of energy conservation by connecting with and influencing their behavior through do-it-yourself tips&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lseb.gov.ng/content/get-involved do-it-yourself tips] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113114547/http://www.lseb.gov.ng/content/get-involved |date=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and exciting interaction with prominent personalities. In September 2013, [[Babatunde Fashola|Governor Babatunde Raji Fashola]] of Lagos State and rapper Jude 'MI'  Abaga (campaign ambassador)(&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/09/mi-becomes-lagos-energy-ambassador/|title=MI becomes Lagos Energy Ambassador  – Vanguard News|date=4 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) participated in the Governor's first ever Google+ Hangout&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|PBmROylwSjM|Governor's first ever Google+ Hangout}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the topic of energy conservation.

In addition to the hangout, during the month of October (the official energy conservation month in the state), LSEB hosted experience centers in malls around Lagos State where members of the public were encouraged to calculate their current household energy consumption and discover ways to save money using the 1st-ever consumer-focused energy app in sub-saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lseb.gov.ng/app |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122093129/http://www.lseb.gov.ng/app |archivedate=22 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To get Lagosians started on energy conservation, Solar Lamps and Phillips Energy-saving bulbs were also given out at each experience center.

===Sri Lanka===

Sri Lanka currently consumes [[fossil fuel]]s, [[Hydroelectricity|hydro power]], [[wind power]], [[solar power]] and [[Energy crop|dendro power]] for their day to day power generation. The [[Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority]] is playing a major role regarding energy management and energy conservation. Today, most of the industries are requested to reduce their energy consumption by using renewable energy sources and optimizing their energy usage.

===Turkey===
[[Turkey]] aims to decrease by at least 20% the amount of energy consumed per GDP of Turkey by the year 2023 (energy intensity).&lt;ref name="TR1"&gt;{{cite web|title=ENER GY EFFICIENCY STRATEGY PAPER|url=http://www.eie.gov.tr/verimlilik/document/Energy_Efficiency_Strategy_Paper.pdf|publisher=Turkish government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main article|Energy conservation in the United States}}
[[File:USEnFlow02-quads.gif]]
The United States is currently the second largest single consumer of energy, following China. The [[U.S. Department of Energy]] categorizes national energy use in four broad sectors: transportation, residential, commercial, and industrial.&lt;ref&gt;US Dept. of Energy, "[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pdf/pages/sec1_3.pdf Annual Energy Report]" (July 2006), Energy Flow diagram&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy usage in transportation and residential sectors, about half of U.S. energy consumption, is largely controlled by individual consumers. Commercial and industrial energy expenditures are determined by businesses entities and other facility managers. National energy policy has a significant effect on energy usage across all four sectors.

Another aspect of energy conversation is using Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. (LEED) This program is not mandatory, it is voluntary. This program has many categories, Energy and Atmosphere Prerequisite, applies to energy conservation. This section focuses on energy performance, renewable energy, energy performance, and many more. This program is designed to promote energy efficiency and be a green building, which is part of conservation. As mention above “energy conservation are efforts made to reduce the consumption of energy.”

[[Image:BanjoPendulum.png|thumb|A: exterior schematic&lt;br&gt;B: normal temperature&lt;br&gt; C: higher temperature]]

The '''gridiron pendulum''' was a temperature-compensated [[clock]] [[pendulum]] invented by British clockmaker [[John Harrison]] around 1726 and later modified by [[John Ellicott (clockmaker)|John Ellicott]]. It was used in precision clocks. In ordinary clock pendulums, the pendulum rod expands and contracts with changes in temperature. The [[frequency|period]] of the pendulum's swing depends on its length, so a pendulum clock's rate varied with changes in ambient temperature, causing inaccurate timekeeping. The gridiron pendulum consists of alternating parallel rods of two metals with different [[thermal expansion]] coefficients, such as [[steel]] and [[brass]]. The rods are connected by a frame in such a way that their different thermal expansions (or contractions) compensate for each other, so the overall length of the pendulum, and thus its period, stays constant with temperature.

The gridiron pendulum was used during the [[Industrial Revolution]] period in [[regulator clock]]s, precision clocks employed as time standards in factories, laboratories, office buildings, and post offices to schedule work and set other clocks. The gridiron became so associated with quality timekeeping that to this day many clocks have pendulums with decorative fake gridirons, which have no temperature compensating qualities.

==How it works==
Its simplest and later form consists of five rods. A central [[iron]] rod runs up from the [[Bob (physics)|bob]] to a point immediately below the suspension. At that point a cross-piece (middle bridge) extends from the central rod and connects to two [[zinc]] rods, one on each side of the central rod, which reach down to, and are fixed to, the bottom bridge just above the bob. The bottom bridge clears the central rod and connects to two further iron rods which run back up to the top bridge attached to the suspension. As the iron rods expand in heat, the bottom bridge drops relative to the suspension, and the bob drops relative to the middle bridge. However, the middle bridge rises relative to the bottom one because the greater expansion of the zinc rods pushes the middle bridge, and therefore the bob, upwards to match the combined drop caused by the expanding iron.

In simple terms, the upwards expansion of the zinc counteracts the combined downwards expansion of the iron (which has a greater total length). The rod lengths are calculated so that the effective length of the zinc rods multiplied by zinc's [[thermal expansion]] coefficient equals the effective length of the iron rods multiplied by iron's expansion coefficient thereby keeping the pendulum the same length.

Harrison's original construction using [[brass]] (pure zinc not being available then) is more complex since brass does not expand as much as zinc does. A further set of rods and bridges is needed giving nine rods in all, five iron and four brass. The exact degree of compensation can be adjusted by having a section of the central rod which is partly brass and partly iron. These overlap (like a sandwich) and are joined by a pin which passes through both metals. A number of holes for the pin are made in both parts and moving the pin up or down the rod changes how much of the combined rod is brass and how much is iron. In the late 19th century the [[Edward John Dent|Dent]] company marketed a further development of the zinc gridiron in which the four outer rods were replaced by two concentric tubes which were linked by a tubular nut which could be screwed up and down to alter the degree of compensation.

==Disadvantages==
Scientists in the 1800s found that the gridiron pendulum had disadvantages that made it unsuitable for the highest precision clocks. The friction of the rods sliding in the holes in the frame caused the rods to adjust to temperature changes in a series of tiny jumps, rather than with a smooth motion. This caused the rate of the pendulum, and therefore the clock, to change suddenly with each jump. Later it was found that zinc is not very stable dimensionally; it is subject to [[creep (deformation)|creep]]. Therefore, another type of temperature-compensated pendulum, the [[Pendulum#Mercury pendulum|mercury pendulum]], was used in the highest precision clocks.  

By 1900, the highest precision astronomical regulators used pendulums of low thermal expansion materials like [[invar]] and [[fused quartz]].

The '''Honda Civic GX''' was the only car factory-built to run on [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) in the U.S. available to non-fleet customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2012-honda-civic-natural-gas-test-review |title=2012 Honda Civic Natural Gas |author=Michael Austin |publisher=Car and Driver (Mar 2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GX was based on the [[Honda Civic]] and available for fleet sales in all 50 states in the US. It was previously available for retail sales in four states ([[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Utah]] and [[Oklahoma]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://automobiles.honda.com/civic-gx/ 2011 Honda Civic GX Overview] honda.com, see lower left&lt;/ref&gt;), but later was made available to retail consumers in 35 states throughout the U.S.&lt;ref name=HPR_20110930&gt;{{cite news|url=http://automobiles.honda.com/news/press-releases-article.aspx?Article=6249-en |title=Honda Press Releases - Honda Announces Pricing Information for 2012 Civic Natural Gas |date=1 September 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GX was manufactured in Honda's [[Greensburg, Indiana]] plant together with the production of  conventional Civics from late 2009.

The third generation GX was awarded the 2012 [[Green Car of the Year]] by the [[Green Car Journal]] in November 2011 at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show]].&lt;ref name=GCOTY/&gt;  For eight years up to 2011, the Civic GX was rated first by the [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] in the "Greenest Vehicle of the Year" list (excluding the years 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2006 when the [[Honda Insight]] hybrid topped the list)&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20090602004615/http://greenercars.org/archive.html&lt;/ref&gt; For 2012 the GX was surpassed by the [[Mitsubishi i-MiEV]].&lt;ref name=ACEEE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plugin0211/&gt;  For 2014, the GX ranked 10th, after several hybrids and electric vehicles. 2015 was the last model year for the Civic GX.

==History==
The Honda Civic GX first appeared in 1998 as a factory-modified Civic LX that had been designed to run exclusively on CNG (compressed natural gas).  In 1998 the Civic GX cost $4500 more than a comparable Civic LX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cngutah.com/faq.html#credit |title=1998 Civic GX Window Sticker |publisher=Cngutah.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car looked and drove just like a contemporary Honda Civic LX, but did not run on gasoline. In 2001, the Civic GX was rated the cleanest-burning internal combustion engine in the world by the EPA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ttnnaaqs/ozone/eac/pr051231_eac_tx_northeast.pdf "Sixth Biannual Report On The Early Action Compact For Northeast Texas"], p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://autos.yahoo.com/green_center-article_114/ "Natural Gas Myths"], Myth 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The GX was first leased to the City of [[Los Angeles]] to be used by parking enforcement officers and other city employees as a live [[beta test]].  The GX followed the same model year design changes as the Civic LX model, until the model year 2001 when a CVT ([[continuously variable transmission]]) was introduced in place of the 4 speed [[automatic transmission]].  In the 2006 year model, the GX again was equipped with the automatic 5 speed transmission, which increased its mileage and extended its range to 250 miles.&lt;ref name="Civic GX FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://automobiles.honda.com/civic-gx/faq.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821193931/http://automobiles.honda.com/civic-gx/faq.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-08-21 |title=Civic GX FAQ |publisher=Automobiles.honda.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 the GX was available for special order in some states to consumers (California and Colorado in particular).

In 2006, the Civic went through its greatest modification since its inception. All variants of the Civic were awarded the 2006 ''[[Motor Trend]]'' "Car of the Year" award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/car/112_0601_coty_2006_honda_civic/index.html |title=Motor Trend |publisher="Motor Trend" |date= |accessdate=2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 8th generation Civic remained unchanged from 2006 and was also available in the GX model. The GX was a very limited-availability car with fewer than a thousand units per year being produced by the factory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/Followup/articleId=116833 "Edmunds, Sept 2006"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804004312/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/Followup/articleId%3D116833 |date=4 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, the 2007 Civic GX became available in [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=Honda061019&gt;[http://corporate.honda.com/press/article.aspx?id=2006101966979 "Honda Press Release: Honda Announces Natural Gas-Powered Civic GX on Sale At Retail Dealers in New York State"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029220641/http://corporate.honda.com/press/article.aspx?id=2006101966979 |date=29 October 2006 }}, 19 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, the GX became available to the public in Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blanco |first=Sebastian |url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/07/30/honda-civic-gx-enters-third-market-in-utah/ |title=autoblog.com |publisher=Green.autoblog.com |date=2009-07-30 |accessdate=2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010 the GX became available to the public in Oklahoma. The CNG Civic in this market related to favorable natural gas costs and the numerous high pressure filling stations.  The promotion of CNG conversions by natural gas producers headquartered in Oklahoma provided incentive for Honda to market the Civic GX there.  State of Oklahoma incentives were a factor that led United Parcel Service to convert part of their delivery truck fleet to CNG.&lt;ref name=AbG0429/&gt; After December 2010, the GX was available for fleet sales in all 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://automobiles.honda.com/civic-gx-fleet/refueling.aspx Honda GX Fleet Info site]&lt;/ref&gt; Retail sales were expanded to 35 states in the fall of 2011.&lt;ref name=HPR_20110930/&gt;

2015 was the last model year for the Civic CNG. The company said it had sold about 16,000 natural-gas vehicles since the model was introduced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honda axing hybrid, CNG versions of Civic sedan|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/06/15/honda-civic-cng-killed/71261180/|website=www.usatoday.com|publisher=gannett| accessdate=15 June 2015| ref=ref usatoday20150615}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly to taxi and commercial fleets. American Honda Motor Company executive vice president John Mendel commented that Honda was phasing out efforts to develop natural-gas powered vehicles and would instead focus on hybrids and electric vehicles. He cited the lack of a CNG fueling infrastructure in the United States as the main reason for the decision to stop producing the Civic CNG. "The infrastructure, while it improved, just wasn't as convenient as petrol," Mendel said. "We gave it a pretty long run and we tried and tried and tried."{{cn|date=October 2016}}

==Specifications==
[[File:2012 Honda Civic GX CNG WAS 2012 0823.JPG|thumb|left|200px|2012 Honda Civic GX with the blue diamond CNG sticker and the new natural gas badging]]
The GX was originally introduced with a 1.6 liter [[Straight-4|I4]] engine. The 2001 model make-over carried a 1.7 liter engine. Beginning in model-year 2006, the 1.8 liter inline four-cylinder engine was introduced to the civic lineup. The
[[Compression ratio|compression ratio]] in the Civic GX is 12.5:1, higher than that of most US pump gasoline-powered automobiles. The significantly higher compression ratio is usable without detonation due to the 120-[[octane]] natural gas that powers the car. Acceleration of the 2012 Civic Natural Gas is less than that of the comparable 4-door 2012 LX model due to both lower power (110&amp;nbsp;hp&amp;nbsp;vs.&amp;nbsp;140&amp;nbsp;hp) and heavier weight (2848&amp;nbsp;lbs&amp;nbsp;vs&amp;nbsp;2705&amp;nbsp;lbs).&lt;ref name="Civic GX Specifications"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://automobiles.honda.com/civic-natural-gas/specifications.aspx |title=Civic Natural Gas Specifications |publisher=Automobiles.honda.com |date=2012-03-14 |accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://automobiles.honda.com/civic-sedan/specifications.aspx |title=Civic LX Specifications |publisher=Automobiles.honda.com |date=2012-03-14 |accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zero-to-sixty times have been clocked at 12.6 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reportermag.com/article/car-review-honda-civic-gx |title='&amp;#39;reportermag.com'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Reporter Online |date= |accessdate=2010-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122235531/http://reportermag.com/article/car-review-honda-civic-gx |archivedate=22 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[CNG cylinder]] (fuel tank) is carried in the trunk of the car and holds 8.0 [[gasoline gallon equivalent]] (GGE) at 3600 [[Pound-force per square inch|psi]].&lt;ref name="Civic GX Specifications"/&gt;

Range on a full 3600 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]] fill is variable, depending on driving conditions and driving technique.

The EPA rates the 2009 Honda Civic GX at 24 equivalent [[miles per gallon|MPG]] city and 36 equivalent MPG highway.&lt;ref name="fueleconomy.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/FEG2008.pdf |title=fueleconomy.gov |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent tests with mixed driving usage found rates of "nearly 32"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/new-cars/first-drives/2008-honda-civic-gx-cng-first-look-3-08/overview/honda-civic-gx-cng-first-look.htm |title=Honda Civic Natural Gas |publisher=[[Consumer Reports]] |date=18 April 2008 |accessdate=28 August 2013}} Updated March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and 26.8&lt;ref name="Edmunds, Aug 2007"/&gt; equivalent MPG. The estimated fuel cost for this vehicle to drive 25 miles in a combination of city and highway driving is $1.47 using [[Compressed Natural Gas|CNG]], based on an average fuel price of $1.93 per gasoline equivalent gallon (121.5 cubic feet).&lt;ref name="fueleconomy.gov"/&gt;
The GX qualifies for [[HOV Lane]] access in [[California]], Arizona, Utah, and other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/carpool/carpool.htm |title=CA HOV eligibility |publisher=Arb.ca.gov |date=2010-11-23 |accessdate=2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home refueling==
Home refueling is available for the GX with the addition of the Phill Home Refueling Appliance. This unit attaches to a home or commercial natural gas source, and compresses the gas into the car's tank through an attached hose. The unit requires a 240 V power source, and uses 800 W when in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Colenso |first=Maria |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/earth/green-technology/sustainable/home/home-refueling-appliance.htm/printable |title=howstuffworks.com |publisher=Science.howstuffworks.com |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Honda did not recommend utilizing home refueling options due to possible moisture and chemical contamination of some natural gas supplies. Honda reserved the right to void the warranty of a car needing service based on inspection of the fuel system for contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honda Civic GX FAQ|url=http://automobiles.honda.com/civic-natural-gas/faq.aspx|publisher=Honda.com|accessdate=5 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honda Civic GX Manual Advises Against Home Refueling |url=http://www.apga.org/i4a/headlines/headlinedetails.cfm?id=1462 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131205055335/http://www.apga.org/i4a/headlines/headlinedetails.cfm?id=1462 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 December 2013 |publisher=American Public Gas Association |accessdate=5 Dec 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2000 the Civic GX rated first in the "Greenest Vehicle of the Year" list by the [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]].  It ranked cleaner than the GM [[EV1]].  It was dethroned by the SULEV-rated [[Honda Insight]] hybrid a year later.  (See http://www.greenercars.org).

The GX again ranked #1 after the Insight was discontinued (2007–11).  In 2012 it was beaten by the new i-MiEV from Mitsubishi.&lt;ref name=ACEEE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenercars.org/Green%20Book%202011%20Press%20FINAL.pdf |title=Latest Technology Place but Don't Win in this Year's Greenest Vehicles List |publisher=GreenCars.org |author=[[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2011-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303151005/http://greenercars.org/Green%20Book%202011%20Press%20FINAL.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Plugin0211&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plugincars.com/chevy-volt-barely-makes-2011-list-top-12-greenest-vehicles-106816.html|title=Chevy Volt Barely Makes 2011 List of Greenest Vehicles|publisher=PluginCars.com|author=Brad Berman|date=2011-02-15|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the GX ranked 10th, after several hybrids and electric vehicles.

In [[fluid mechanics]], a [[fluid]] is said to be in '''hydrostatic equilibrium''' or '''hydrostatic balance''' when it is at rest, or when the flow velocity at each point is constant over time. This occurs when external forces such as [[gravity]] are balanced by a [[pressure-gradient force]].&lt;ref&gt;White (2008). p 63, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the pressure-gradient force prevents gravity from collapsing [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] into a thin, dense shell, whereas gravity prevents the pressure gradient force from diffusing the atmosphere into space.

Hydrostatic equilibrium is the current distinguishing criterion between [[dwarf planet]]s and [[Small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]], and has other roles in [[astrophysics]] and [[planetary geology]]. This qualification typically means that the object is symmetrically rounded into a [[spheroid]] or [[ellipsoid]] shape, where any irregular surface features are due to a relatively thin solid [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. There are [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System|32 observationally confirmed&lt;!--of the DPs, only Ceres, Pluto, and Eris are obs. confirmed. the others rely on mathematical modeling.--&gt; such objects]] (apart from the Sun), sometimes called ''[[planemo]]s,''&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Stern]] considers these all to be "planets", but that conception was rejected by the [[International Astronomical Union]].&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Solar System]], seven more&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dps.html |title=Astronomer Mike Brown |publisher=Gps.caltech.edu |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2014-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018154917/http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dps.html |archivedate=2011-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--3 accepted by the IAU, &amp; 4 more that "must" be according to Mike Brown--&gt; that are virtually certain, and [[List of possible dwarf planets|a hundred or so more]] that are likely.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

==Mathematical consideration==
[[File:Hydrostatic equilibrium.svg|thumb|right|If the highlighted volume of fluid is not accelerating, the forces on it upwards must equal the forces downwards.]]

===Derivation from force summation===
[[Newton's laws of motion]] state that a volume of a fluid that is not in motion or that is in a state of constant velocity must have zero net force on it. This means the sum of the forces in a given direction must be opposed by an equal sum of forces in the opposite direction. This force balance is called a hydrostatic equilibrium.

The fluid can be split into a large number of [[cuboid]] volume elements; by considering a single element, the action of the fluid can be derived.

There are 3 forces: the force downwards onto the top of the cuboid from the pressure, P, of the fluid above it is, from the definition of [[pressure]],
:&lt;math&gt;F_{top} = - P_{top} \cdot A.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the force on the volume element from the pressure of the fluid below pushing upwards is
:&lt;math&gt;F_{bottom} = P_{bottom} \cdot A.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the [[weight]] of the volume element causes a force downwards.  If the [[density]] is ρ, the volume is V and g the [[standard gravity]], then:
:&lt;math&gt;F_{weight} = -\rho \cdot g \cdot V.&lt;/math&gt;
The volume of this cuboid is equal to the area of the top or bottom, times the height&amp;nbsp;— the formula for finding the volume of a cube.
:&lt;math&gt;F_{weight} = -\rho \cdot g \cdot A \cdot h&lt;/math&gt;

By balancing these forces, the total force on the fluid is
:&lt;math&gt;\sum F = F_{bottom} + F_{top} + F_{weight} = P_{bottom} \cdot A - P_{top} \cdot A - \rho \cdot g \cdot A \cdot h.&lt;/math&gt;
This sum equals zero if the fluid's velocity is constant.  Dividing by A,
:&lt;math&gt;0 = P_{bottom} - P_{top} - \rho \cdot g \cdot h.&lt;/math&gt;
Or,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{top} - P_{bottom} = - \rho \cdot g \cdot h.&lt;/math&gt;
P&lt;sub&gt;top&lt;/sub&gt; − P&lt;sub&gt;bottom&lt;/sub&gt; is a change in pressure, and h is the height of the volume element—a change in the distance above the ground.  By saying these changes are [[infinitesimal]]ly small, the equation can be written in [[differential equation|differential]] form.
:&lt;math&gt;dP = - \rho \cdot g \cdot dh.&lt;/math&gt;
Density changes with pressure, and gravity changes with height, so the equation would be:
:&lt;math&gt;dP = - \rho(P) \cdot g(h) \cdot dh.&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation from Navier–Stokes equations===
Note finally that this last equation can be derived by solving the three-dimensional [[Navier–Stokes equations]] for the equilibrium situation where
:&lt;math&gt;u=v=\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Then the only non-trivial equation is the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-equation, which now reads
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}+\rho g=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, hydrostatic balance can be regarded as a particularly simple equilibrium solution of the Navier–Stokes equations.

===Derivation from general relativity===
By plugging the energy momentum tensor for a [[perfect fluid]]
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu}=(\rho c^{-2}+P)u^\mu u^\nu+Pg^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
into the [[Einstein field equations]]
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu\nu}=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}(T_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}T)&lt;/math&gt;
and using the conservation condition
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu}=0&lt;/math&gt;
one can derive the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation]] for the structure of a static, spherically symmetric relativistic star in isotropic coordinates:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dr}=-\frac{G M(r)\rho(r)}{r^2}\left(1+\frac{P(r)}{\rho(r)c^2}\right)\left(1+\frac{4\pi r^3P(r)}{M(r)c^2}\right)\left(1-\frac{2GM(r)}{r c^2}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
In practice, ''Ρ'' and ''ρ'' are related by an equation of state of the form ''f''(''Ρ'',''ρ'')=0, with ''f'' specific to makeup of the star. ''M''(''r'') is a foliation of spheres weighted by the mass density ''ρ''(''r''), with the largest sphere having radius ''r'':
:&lt;math&gt;M(r)=4\pi\int_0^r dr' r'^2\rho(r').&lt;/math&gt;
Per standard procedure in taking the nonrelativistic limit, we let ''c''→∞, so that the factor
:&lt;math&gt;\left(1+\frac{P(r)}{\rho(r)c^2}\right)\left(1+\frac{4\pi r^3P(r)}{M(r)c^2}\right)\left(1-\frac{2GM(r)}{r c^2}\right)^{-1}\rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, in the nonrelativistic limit the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation reduces to Newton's hydrostatic equilibrium:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dr}=-\frac{GM(r)\rho(r)}{r^2}=-g(r)\,\rho(r)\longrightarrow dP = - \rho(h)\,g(h)\, dh&lt;/math&gt;
(we have made the trivial notation change ''h''=''r'' and have used ''f''(''Ρ'',''ρ'')=0 to express ''ρ'' in terms of ''P'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zee|first1=A.|title=Einstein gravity in a nutshell|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9780691145587|pages=451–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar equation can be computed for rotating, axially symmetric stars, which in its gauge independent form reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial_i P}{P+\rho} - \partial_i \ln u^t + u_t u^{\phi}\partial_i\frac{u_{\phi}}{u_t}=0&lt;/math&gt; 
Unlike the TOV equilibrium equation, these are two equations (for instance, if as usual when treating stars, one chooses spherical coordinates as basis coordinates &lt;math&gt;(t,r,\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, the index ''i'' runs for the coordinates ''r'' and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;).

==Applications==

===Fluids===
The hydrostatic equilibrium pertains to [[hydrostatics]] and the [[principles of equilibrium]] of [[fluid]]s.  A hydrostatic balance is a particular balance for weighing substances in water.  Hydrostatic balance allows the [[discovery (observation)|discovery]] of their [[specific gravity|specific gravities]].

===Astrophysics===
In any given layer of a [[star]], there is a hydrostatic equilibrium between the outward thermal pressure from below and the weight of the material above pressing inward.  The [[isotropic]] gravitational field compresses the star into the most compact shape possible. A rotating star in hydrostatic equilibrium is an [[oblate spheroid]] up to a certain (critical) angular velocity. An extreme example of this phenomenon is the star [[Vega]], which has a rotation period of 12.5 hours. Consequently, Vega is about 20% larger at the equator than at the poles. A star with an angular velocity above the critical angular velocity becomes a [[Jacobi ellipsoid|Jacobi (scalene) ellipsoid]], and at still faster rotation it is no longer ellipsoidal but [[wikt:pyriform|piriform]] or [[oviform]], with yet other shapes beyond that, though shapes beyond scalene are not stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.josleys.com/show_gallery.php?galid=313 |title=Gallery : The shape of Planet Earth |publisher=Josleys.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the star has a massive nearby companion object then [[tidal force]]s come into play as well, distorting the star into a scalene shape when rotation alone would make it a spheroid.  An example of this is [[Beta Lyrae]].

Hydrostatic equilibrium is also important for the [[intracluster medium]], where it restricts the amount of fluid that can be present in the core of a [[cluster of galaxies]].

We can also use the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium to estimate the [[velocity dispersion]] of [[dark matter]] in clusters of galaxies. Only [[baryon]]ic matter (or, rather, the collisions thereof) emits [[X-ray]] radiation. The absolute X-ray [[luminosity]] per unit volume takes the form &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X=\Lambda(T_B)\rho_B^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;T_B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_B&lt;/math&gt; are the temperature and density of the baryonic matter, and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda(T)&lt;/math&gt; is some function of temperature and fundamental constants. The baryonic density satisfies the above equation &lt;math&gt;dP=-\rho gdr&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;p_B(r+dr)-p_B(r)=-dr\frac{\rho_B(r)G}{r^2}\int_0^r 4\pi r^2\,\rho_M(r)\, dr.&lt;/math&gt;
The integral is a measure of the total mass of the cluster, with &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; being the proper distance to the center of the cluster. Using the [[ideal gas law]] &lt;math&gt;p_B=kT_B\rho_B/m_B&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and &lt;math&gt;m_B&lt;/math&gt; is a characteristic mass of the baryonic gas particles) and rearranging, we arrive at
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{kT_B(r)\rho_B(r)}{m_B}\right)=-\frac{\rho_B(r)G}{r^2}\int_0^r 4\pi r^2\,\rho_M(r)\, dr.&lt;/math&gt;
Multiplying by &lt;math&gt;r^2/\rho_B(r)&lt;/math&gt; and differentiating with respect to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\left[\frac{r^2}{\rho_B(r)}\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{kT_B(r)\rho_B(r)}{m_B}\right)\right]=-4\pi Gr^2\rho_M(r).&lt;/math&gt;
If we make the assumption that cold dark matter particles have an isotropic velocity distribution, then the same derivation applies to these particles, and their density &lt;math&gt;\rho_D=\rho_M-\rho_B&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the non-linear differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\left[\frac{r^2}{\rho_D(r)}\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{kT_D(r)\rho_D(r)}{m_D}\right)\right]=-4\pi Gr^2\rho_M(r).&lt;/math&gt;
With perfect X-ray and distance data, we could calculate the baryon density at each point in the cluster and thus the dark matter density. We could then calculate the velocity dispersion &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_D&lt;/math&gt; of the dark matter, which is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_D=\frac{kT_D}{m_D}.&lt;/math&gt; 
The central density ratio &lt;math&gt;\rho_B(0)/\rho_M(0)&lt;/math&gt; is dependent on the [[redshift]] &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; of the cluster and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_B(0)/\rho_M(0)\propto (1+z)^2\left(\frac{\theta}{s}\right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angular width of the cluster and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; the proper distance to the cluster. Values for the ratio range from .11 to .14 for various surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinberg|first1=Steven|title=Cosmology|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-852682-7|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planetary geology===
The concept of hydrostatic equilibrium has also become important in determining whether an astronomical object is a [[planet]], [[dwarf planet]], or [[small Solar System body]]. According to the [[definition of planet]] adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 2006, one defining characteristic of planets and dwarf planets is that they are objects that have sufficient gravity to overcome their own rigidity and assume hydrostatic equilibrium. Such a body will normally have the differentiated interior and geology of a world (a [[planemo]]), though near-hydrostatic bodies such as the proto-planet [[4 Vesta]] may also be differentiated. Sometimes the equilibrium shape is an [[oblate spheroid]], as is the case with Earth. However, in the cases of moons in synchronous orbit, nearly unidirectional tidal forces create a [[scalene ellipsoid]]. Also, the dwarf planet {{dp|Haumea}} is scalene due to its rapid rotation.

It had been thought that icy objects with a diameter larger than roughly 400&amp;nbsp;km are usually in hydrostatic equilibrium, whereas those smaller than that are not. Icy objects need less mass for hydrostatic equilibrium than rocky objects. The smallest object that is known to have an equilibrium shape is the icy moon [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] at 397&amp;nbsp;km, whereas the largest object known to have an obviously non-equilibrium shape is the rocky asteroid [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] at 532&amp;nbsp;km (582&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;556&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;500&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;18&amp;nbsp;km). However, Mimas is not actually in hydrostatic equilibrium for its current rotation. The smallest body confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium is the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], at 945 km, whereas the largest body known to not be in hydrostatic equilibrium is the icy moon [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]], at 1,470&amp;nbsp;km.

Because the [[terrestrial planet]]s and dwarf planets (and likewise the larger [[natural satellite|satellites]], like the [[Moon]] and [[Io (moon)|Io]]) have irregular surfaces, this definition evidently has some flexibility, but a specific means of quantifying an object's shape by this standard has not yet been announced. Local irregularities may be consistent with global equilibrium. For example, the massive base of the tallest&lt;!--as opposed to highest--&gt; mountain on Earth, [[Mauna Kea]], has deformed and depressed the level of the surrounding crust, so that the overall distribution of mass approaches equilibrium. The amount of leeway afforded the definition could affect the classification of the asteroid [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], which may have solidified while in hydrostatic equilibrium but was subsequently significantly deformed by large impacts (now 572.6&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;557.2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;446.4&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name="Hubble"&gt;{{cite web

===Atmospherics===
In the atmosphere, the pressure of the air decreases with increasing altitude. This pressure difference causes an upward force called the [[pressure-gradient force]]. The force of gravity balances this out, keeping the atmosphere bound to Earth and maintaining pressure differences with altitude.

'''Intercontinental Exchange''' (ICE) is an American company that owns [[Futures exchange|exchanges]] for financial and commodity markets, and operates 12 regulated exchanges and marketplaces.  This includes ICE [[futures exchange]]s in the United States, Canada and Europe, the [[London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange|Liffe]] futures exchanges in Europe, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] equity options exchanges and [[Over-the-counter (finance)|OTC]] energy, credit and equity markets.

ICE also owns and operates 6 central [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing houses]]: ICE Clear U.S., ICE Clear Europe, ICE Clear Singapore, ICE Clear Credit, ICE Clear Netherlands and ICE [http://www.ngx.com/ NGX]. ICE has offices in Atlanta, [[New York City|New York]], [[London]], [[Chicago]], [[Houston]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Calgary]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[San Francisco]], [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Singapore]].

== History ==
[[Jeffrey C. Sprecher]] was a power plant developer who spotted a need for a seamless market in natural gas used to power generators.&lt;ref name="ReutersICEtimeline"&gt;{{cite news|title=Timeline: Growth of the IntercontinentalExchange|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/20/ice-nyse-ice-idUSL1E8NK6G420121220|date=20 December 2012|accessdate=4 August 2013|publisher=Reuters}}"Atlanta-based ICE operates four regulated futures exchanges, two over-the-counter markets and five clearing houses globally. Its growth from a small energy exchange since the early 2000s has been influential in the evolution of the derivatives markets since then, paralleling the rise of commodities as a mainstream asset class, the consolidation of the exchange industry, the disappearance of the floor trader with the move to all-electronic trading platforms and the growth of swaps 
clearing."&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1990s, Sprecher acquired Continental Power Exchange, Inc. with the objective of developing an Internet-based platform to provide a more transparent and efficient market structure for OTC energy commodity trading.{{harv|Popper|2013}}&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news | author=Nathaniel Popper| date=January 19, 2013| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/business/jeffrey-sprechers-improbable-path-to-buying-the-nyse.html?pagewanted=all| title=Buying the N.Y.S.E., in One Shot| publisher=New York Times| accessdate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2000, ICE was founded by Sprecher and backed by [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Morgan Stanley]], [[BP]], [[Total S.A.|Total]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[Deutsche Bank]] and [[Société Générale]] &lt;ref name="Greenberger2008"&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Greenberger|url=http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cong_test/27/ |series=Testimony presented at a hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. 110th Congress, 1st Session (2008)|title=Energy Market Manipulation and Federal Enforcement Regimes|year=2008 |publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Secretive Banking Elite Rules Trading in Derivatives|author=Louise Story |publisher=New York Times |date=11 December 2010 |accessdate=15 March 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/business/12advantage.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; who represent some of the world's largest energy traders.

The new exchange offered the trading community better price transparency, more efficiency, greater [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] and lower costs than manual trading. While the company's original focus was energy products (crude and refined [[crude oil|oil]], [[natural gas]], [[electrical power industry|power]], and [[emissions trading|emissions]]), acquisitions have expanded its activity into soft commodities ([[sugar]], [[cotton]] and [[coffee]]), [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] and [[equity index]] futures.

In a response to [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|US financial crisis]] in 2008, Sprecher formed ICE US Trust based in New York, now called ICE Clear Credit LLC, to serve as a limited-purpose bank, a clearing house for [[credit default swap]]s. Sprecher worked closely with the [[Federal Reserve]] to serve as its over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives clearing house. "US regulators were keen on the kind of clearing house for opaque over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives as a risk management device. In the absence of a central counterparty - which would guarantee pay-outs should a trading party be unable to do so - there was a high risk of massive market disruption&lt;ref name="Weitzman 2008"&gt;{{harv|Weitzman|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;".

The principal backers for ICE US Trust were the same financial institutions most affected by the crisis, the top ten of the world's largest banks (Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS). Sprecher's clearing house cleared their global [[credit default swap]]s (CDS) in exchange for sharing profits with these banks.&lt;ref name="Weitzman 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Terhune|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 30 September 2008 the [[Financial Post]] warned that the "$54000bn credit derivatives market faced its biggest test in October 2008 as billions of dollars worth of contracts on now-defaulted derivatives would be auctioned by the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] . In his article in the [[Financial Post]], he described ICE as a "US-based electronic futures exchange" which raised the stakes on October 30, 2008 in its effort to expand in the $54000 bn credit derivatives market.{{harv|Weitzman|2008}}&lt;ref name="financialtimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/60facd78-a6ec-11dd-95be-000077b07658.html#axzz2KziaFQWW |date=31 October 2008|title=ICE deal signals new clearing house for credit default swaps |first=Hal|last=Weitzman|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, Intercontinental Exchange had cleared more than $10 trillion in [[credit default swap]]s (CDS) through its subsidiaries, ICE Trust CDS  (now ICE Clear Credit).{{harv|Terhune|2010}}&lt;ref name="businessweek1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_32/b4190056333791.htm|publisher=Bloomberg Business Week|title=ICE's Jeffrey Sprecher: The Sultan of Swaps|author=Chad Terhune|date=29 July 2010|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017 Intercontinental Exchange had been named to the [http://fortune.com/2017/10/19/future-50-companies-intro/ Fortune Future 50] determining the top 50 companies that are best positioned to adapt and deliver growth in a complex environment. ICE was also named to the Fortune 500 in June 2017 and is the only exchange operator included in the ranking.

== Mergers and acquisitions ==
{{Intricate detail|section|date=July 2018}}
The Intercontinental Exchange has had a policy to grow through the acquisition of other exchanges, a number of these have been successful while others have failed due to concerns by regulators or others that the new company would have created a monopoly situation.  The major acquisition and attempted acquisitions have included:

=== International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) 2001 ===
In June 2001, ICE expanded its business into futures trading by acquiring the London-based [[International Petroleum Exchange]] (IPE), now ICE Futures Europe, which operated Europe's leading open-outcry energy futures exchange. Since 2003, ICE has partnered with the [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] (CCX) to host its electronic marketplaces. In April 2005, the entire ICE portfolio of energy futures became fully electronic and ICE closed [[International Petroleum Exchange]]'s high profile and historic trading floor.&lt;ref name="nytimes1" /&gt;

=== New York Board of Trade (NYBOT) 2005 ===
ICE became a publicly traded company on November 16, 2005, and was added to the Russell 1000 Index on June 30, 2006.  The company expanded rapidly in 2007, acquiring the [[New York Board of Trade]] (NYBOT),&lt;ref&gt;ICE Press Release (1/12/2007). [https://www.theice.com/showpr.jhtml?id=4600"IntercontinentalExchange and New York Board of Trade Complete Merger"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122504/https://www.theice.com/showpr.jhtml?id=4600 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ChemConnect (a chemical commodity market).

=== Chicago Board of Trade Unsuccessful Bid 2007 ===
In March 2007 ICE made an unsuccessful $9.9 billion bid for the [[Chicago Board of Trade]], which was instead acquired by the [[CME Group]].&lt;ref name="ChicagoTribuneManor"&gt;{{cite news|author=Robert Manor|date=2007-07-11|title=CBOT loss won't alter ICE agenda|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-07-11/business/0707100798_1_cbot-futures-and-options-trading-futures-exchanges|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Winnipeg Commodity Exchange (WCE) 2007 ===
IntercontinentalExchange Inc., the "upstart Atlanta-based energy bourse" purchased the privately held 120-year-old [[Winnipeg Commodity Exchange]], known for its canola futures contract, for $40 million.&lt;ref name="Upstart20070623"&gt;{{cite news| title=Upstart ICE to buy Winnipeg exchange in $40 million deal|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2007/06/23/upstart_ice_to_buy_winnipeg_exchange_in_40_million_deal.html| location=Winnipeg| first=Roberta
| last=Rampton| publisher=Reuters News Agency| newspaper=The Star| date=June 23, 2007| accessdate= February 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Winnipeg Commodity Exchange (WCE) was renamed ICE Futures Canada as of January 1, 2008.&lt;ref name="icepr20071231"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ir.theice.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=283964|publisher=theice.com |series=Press Release |date=December 31, 2007 |title=Winnipeg Commodity Exchange to Become Ice Canada |accessdate=February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange had "closed its open-outcry trading floor" becoming "the first North American agricultural futures exchange to trade exclusively on an electronic platform" by trading via the "Chicago Board of Trade's electronic platform, and [using] clearing services from the Kansas City Board of Trade.&lt;ref name="Upstart20070623" /&gt; IntercontinentalExchange converted Winnipeg Commodity Exchange contracts to the IntercontinentalExchange platform.&lt;ref name="Upstart20070623" /&gt; IntercontinentalExchange maintained an office and "small core staff" in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Manitoba Securities Commission oversee its operations.&lt;ref name="Upstart20070623" /&gt;

=== Creditex 2008 ===
In June 2008, ICE announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Creditex Group Inc. (Creditex).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ir.theice.com/press/press-releases/all-categories/2008/06-03-2008b|publisher=ICE|date=3 June 2008|title=INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF CREDITEX GROUP INC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction consideration totaled $625 million comprising approximately $565 million in ICE common stock and $60 million in cash, as well as a working capital adjustment to be finalized at closing. Upon the closing of the transaction, Creditex Group became a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE, operating under the Creditex name.

=== TSX Group's Natural Gas Exchange Partnership 2008 ===
In January 2008, ICE partnered with Canada's [[TSX Group]]'s Natural Gas Exchange, expanding their offering to clearing and settlement services for physical OTC natural gas contracts.&lt;ref&gt;ICE NGX [https://www.theice.com/ngx.jhtml "NGX Physical Gas and Power Products Coming to ICE"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate Exchange 2010 ===
In April 2010, ICE acquired Climate Exchange PLC for 395 million pounds ($622 million) and [[European Climate Exchange]] (ECX) as part of its purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Szabo, Michael |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/08/11/us-carbon-ccx-layoffs-idUSTRE67A3K620100811 |title=ICE cuts staff at Chicago Climate Exchange: sources |publisher=Reuters |date=August 11, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exchange-traded emissions products were first offered by the European Climate Exchange (ECX), which was established in 2005, by listing products on the ICE Futures Europe's trading platform. ICE Futures Europe is the leading market for [[Carbon emission trading|carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions]]. ICE's ECX products comply with the requirements of the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]].

=== NYSE Euronext 2013 ===
In February 2011, in the wake of an announced merger of [[NYSE Euronext]] with [[Deutsche Börse]], speculation developed that ICE and Nasdaq could mount a counter-bid of their own for NYSE Euronext. ICE was thought to be looking to acquire the American exchange's derivatives business, Nasdaq its cash equities business.

Another week later, ICE and Nasdaq sweetened their offer, including a $.17 increase per share to $42.67 and a $350 million breakup fee if the deal were to encounter regulatory trouble. The two said the offer was a $2 billion (21%) premium over the Deutsche offer and that they had fully committed financing of $3.8 billion from lenders to finance the deal.&lt;ref name=marketwatchMorcroft2011&gt;{{cite news|author=Morcroft, Greg|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/nasdaq-and-ice-sweeten-the-pot-for-nyse-2011-04-19|title=Nasdaq and ICE sweeten the pot for NYSE|publisher=[[MarketWatch]]|date=19 April 2011|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], also in April, "initiated an antitrust review of the proposal, which would have brought nearly all U.S. stock listings under a merged Nasdaq-NYSE."

In August 2018 Intercontinental Exchange announced that it planned to form a new company, Bakkt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tully, Shawn |url=https://fortune.com/longform/nyse-owner-bitcoin-exchange-startup/ |title=The NYSE's Owner Wants to Bring Bitcoin to Your 401(k). Are Crypto Credit Cards Next?: sources |publisher=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=August 3, 2018 |accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is intended to leverage [[Microsoft]] cloud solutions to create an open and regulated, global ecosystem for digital assets. The new company will work with a marquee group of organizations including [[Boston Consulting Group]] (BCG), [[Microsoft]], [[Starbucks]], and others, to create an integrated platform that enables consumers and institutions to buy, sell, store and spend digital assets on a seamless global network.

The Bakkt ecosystem is expected to include federally regulated markets and warehousing along with merchant and consumer applications. Its first use cases will be for trading and conversion of [[Bitcoin]] versus [[Fiat money|fiat currencies]], as Bitcoin is today the most liquid digital currency. The effort is designed to address evolving needs in the estimated $270 billion digital asset marketplace.

As an initial component of the Bakkt offering, Intercontinental Exchange’s U.S.-based futures exchange and clearing house plan to launch a 1-day physically delivered Bitcoin contract along with physical warehousing in November 2018, subject to CFTC review and approval. These regulated venues will establish new protocols for managing the specific security and settlement requirements of digital currencies. In addition, the clearing house plans to create a separate guarantee fund that will be funded by Bakkt.

In addition to Intercontinental Exchange and [[M12 (venture capital)|M12]], Microsoft’s venture capital arm, investors in Bakkt are expected to include, among others, an affiliate of [[Fortress Investment Group]], Eagle Seven, Galaxy Digital, [[Horizons Ventures]], Alan Howard, Pantera Capital, Protocol Ventures, and [[Susquehanna International Group]], LLP.

The '''Jordan Radioactive Storage Facility''' is a proposed national storage facility in [[Amman]] for Jordan's radioactive waste and [[nuclear materials]].

The agreement between [[Jordan Atomic Energy Commission]] (JAEC) and the US Department of Energy's (DoE's) [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] (PNNL) was signed by [[Ned Xoubi]], [[nuclear fuel]] cycle [[commissioner]] at JAEC, and [[Daniel Rutherford]], contract manager at [[PNNL]].&lt;ref&gt;World Nuclear News "USA to construct Jordanian storage facility" http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/WR-USA_to_construct_Jordanian_storage_facility-0903094.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The project, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2009, will comprise approximately four thousands square feet of storage facility that will, in turn, host Jordan's [[radioactive waste]] and nuclear sources in a safe and secure environment for the next five decades. All [[radioactive]] waste will be managed, stored and monitored in strict accordance with the best international standards and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) guidelines.

The facility is the first of its kind in [[Jordan]] and is being designed and constructed by Jordanian engineers with the help of American experts. JAEC will provide the project manager [[Ned Xoubi]], and the [[United States Department of Energy|DoE]] will provide JAEC with $370,000 for the construction of the central storage facility.&lt;ref&gt;Mark McFadden "Jordan And U.S. To Team On Radioactive Storage Facility" http://nuclearstreet.com/blogs/nuclear_power_news/archive/2009/03/09/jordan.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

It is named after the distinguished 19th-century physicist [[Josef Stefan|Jožef Stefan]], best known for his work on the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]] of [[Black body|black-body]] radiation.

IJS is today involved in a wide variety of fields of scientific and economic interest. After close to 60 years of scientific achievement, the institute has become part of the image of [[Slovenia]].

Over the last 60 years it has created a number of important institutions, such as the [[University of Nova Gorica]], the Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mps.si/splet/index.asp?lang=eng|title=The 2013/2014 CALL FOR ENROLMENT to postgraduate study programmes|publisher=Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ljubljana Technology park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tp-lj.si/|title=Tehnološki Park Ljubljana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linear aeration''' is a relatively new [[aeration]] process; it allows water to penetrate the [[soil]] and to be retained in the proper amounts. Linear aeration also adds [[organic material|organic]] nutrition, soil softeners ([[humus]], [[topsoil]], [[compost]], sand, [[clay]], etc.) if necessary.

==Gardens==
In linear aeration, the necessary organic matter is added on top of the soil surface, between plantings. The grooves are then cut into the soil to let the amendments and additives enter the soil; and recovered in the same passage.

==Lawns==
Linear aeration also alleviates excessive water in [[lawn]] areas. In linear aeration, the necessary organic matter is added on top of the turf. Next, grooves are cut into the turf to let the soil additives enter the soil; the grooves are recovered in the same passage.

==Benefits of linear aeration==
===Gardens===
*[[irrigation]] [[water conservation]].
*promotes stronger and deeper root development, for plant health and drought tolerance.
*permits proper distribution of [[soil amendment]]s and additives.
*allows organic nutrition absorption.

====Lawns====
*alleviates [[soil compaction]] in heavily traveled areas
*provides smoother [[lawn]] surfaces
*drastically reduces disruption of actual turf surface compared to coring or plugs aeration
*causes minimal interruption of use of athletic fields

'''Lithium hydride''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the formula [[Lithium|Li]][[Hydride|H]]. This [[alkali metal hydride]] is a colorless solid, although commercial samples are grey. Characteristic of a salt-like (ionic) hydride, it has a high melting point, and it is not soluble but reactive with all organic and protic solvents. It is soluble and nonreactive with certain [[molten salt]]s such as [[lithium fluoride]], [[lithium borohydride]], and  [[sodium hydride]]. With a molecular mass of slightly less than 8.0, it is the lightest [[ionic compound]].

==Physical properties==
LiH is a [[diamagnetism|diamagnetic]] and an ionic conductor with a conductivity gradually increasing from {{val|2|e=-5|u=Ω&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} at 443&amp;nbsp;°C to 0.18&amp;nbsp;Ω&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at 754&amp;nbsp;°C; there is no discontinuity in this increase through the melting point.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|36}} The [[dielectric constant]] of LiH decreases from 13.0 (static, low frequencies) to 3.6 (visible-light frequencies).&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|35}} LiH is a soft material with a [[Mohs hardness]] of 3.5.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|42}} Its compressive creep (per 100 hours) rapidly increases from &lt;&amp;nbsp;1% at 350&amp;nbsp;°C to &gt;&amp;nbsp;100% at 475&amp;nbsp;°C, meaning that LiH can't provide mechanical support when heated.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|39}}

The [[thermal conductivity]] of LiH decreases with temperature and depends on morphology: the corresponding values are 0.125&amp;nbsp;W/(cm·K) for crystals and 0.0695&amp;nbsp;W/(cm·K) for compacts at 50&amp;nbsp;°C, and 0.036&amp;nbsp;W/(cm·K) for crystals and 0.0432&amp;nbsp;W/(cm·K) for compacts at 500&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|60}} The linear [[thermal expansion coefficient]] is 4.2{{e|-5}}/°C at room temperature.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|49}}

==Synthesis and processing==
LiH is produced by treating [[lithium]] metal with [[hydrogen]] gas:
: 2 Li + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 LiH

This reaction is especially rapid at temperatures above 600&amp;nbsp;°C. Addition of 0.001–0.003% carbon, or/and increasing temperature or/and pressure, increases the yield up to 98% at 2-hour residence time.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|147}} However, the reaction proceeds at temperatures as low as 29&amp;nbsp;°C. The yield is 60% at 99&amp;nbsp;°C and 85% at 125&amp;nbsp;°C, and the rate depends significantly on the surface condition of LiH.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

Less common ways of LiH synthesis include thermal decomposition of [[lithium aluminium hydride]] (200&amp;nbsp;°C), [[lithium borohydride]] (300&amp;nbsp;°C), [[n-butyllithium]] (150&amp;nbsp;°C), or [[ethyllithium]] (120&amp;nbsp;°C), as well as several reactions involving lithium compounds of low stability and available hydrogen content.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|144–145}}

Chemical reactions yield LiH in the form of lumped powder, which can be compressed into pellets without a binder. More complex shapes can be produced by casting from the melt.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|160 ff.}} Large single crystals (about 80&amp;nbsp;mm long and 16&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter) can be then grown from molten LiH powder in hydrogen atmosphere by the [[Bridgman–Stockbarger technique]]. They often have bluish color owing to the presence of colloidal Li. This color can be removed by post-growth annealing at lower temperatures (~550&amp;nbsp;°C) and lower thermal gradients.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|154}} Major impurities in these crystals are Na (20–200 parts per million, ppm), O (10–100 ppm), Mg (0.5–6 ppm), Fe (0.5-2 ppm) and Cu (0.5-2 ppm).&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|155}}

[[File:LiHcrack.jpg|thumb|left|Cracking in cast LiH after machining with a [[fly cutter]]. Scale is in inches.]]
Bulk cold-pressed LiH parts can be easily machined using standard techniques and tools to [[micrometre|micrometer]] precision. However, cast LiH is brittle and easily cracks during processing.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|171}}

==Reactions==
LiH powder reacts rapidly with air of low humidity, forming [[lithium hydroxide|LiOH]], [[lithium oxide|{{chem|Li|2|O}}]] and [[lithium carbonate|{{chem|Li|2|CO|3}}]]. In moist air the powder ignites spontaneously, forming a mixture of products including some nitrogenous compounds. The lump material reacts with humid air, forming a superficial coating, which is a viscous fluid. This inhibits further reaction, although the appearance of a film of "tarnish" is quite evident. Little or no nitride is formed on exposure to humid air. The lump material, contained in a metal dish, may be heated in air to slightly below 200&amp;nbsp;°C without igniting, although it ignites readily when touched by an open flame. The surface condition of LiH, presence of oxides on the metal dish, etc., have a considerable effect on the ignition temperature. Dry oxygen does not react with crystalline LiH unless heated strongly, when an almost explosive combustion occurs.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

LiH is highly reactive toward water and other protic reagents:&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
:LiH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

LiH is less reactive with water than Li and thus is a much less powerful reducing agent for water, alcohols, and other media containing reducible solutes. This is true for all the binary saline hydrides.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|22}}

LiH pellets slowly expand in moist air, forming LiOH; however, the expansion rate is below 10% within 24 hours in a pressure of 2&amp;nbsp;[[Torr]] of water vapor.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|7}} If moist air contains carbon dioxide, then the product is lithium carbonate.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|8}} LiH reacts with ammonia, slowly at room temperature, but the reaction accelerates significantly above 300&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|10}} LiH reacts slowly with higher alcohols and [[phenol]]s, but vigorously with lower alcohols.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|14}}

LiH reacts with sulfur dioxide:
:2 LiH + 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
though above 50&amp;nbsp;°C the product is lithium dithionite.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|9}}

LiH reacts with acetylene to form lithium carbide and hydrogen. With anhydrous organic acids, phenols and acid anhydrides LiH reacts slowly, producing hydrogen gas and the lithium salt of the acid. With water-containing acids, LiH reacts faster than with water.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|8}} Many reactions of LiH with oxygen-containing species yield LiOH, which in turn irreversibly reacts with LiH at temperatures above 300&amp;nbsp;°C:&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|10}}
:LiH + LiOH → Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Applications==

===Hydrogen storage and fuel===
With a hydrogen content in proportion to its mass three times that of NaH, LiH has the highest hydrogen content of any hydride. LiH is periodically of interest for hydrogen storage, but applications have been thwarted by its stability to decomposition. Thus removal of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; requires temperatures above the 700&amp;nbsp;°C used for its synthesis, such temperatures are expensive to create and maintain. The compound was once tested as a fuel component in a model rocket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/lex.htm Lex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723202520/http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/lex.htm |date=2008-07-23 }}.

Ntrs.nasa.gov. Retrieved on 2011-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursor to complex metal hydrides===
LiH is not usually a hydride-reducing agent, except in the synthesis of hydrides of certain metalloids. For example, [[silane]] is produced in the reaction of lithium hydride and [[silicon tetrachloride]] by the Sundermeyer process:
:4 LiH + SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 4 LiCl + SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

Lithium hydride is used in the production of a variety of reagents for [[organic synthesis]], such as [[lithium aluminium hydride]] (LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[lithium borohydride]] (LiBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Triethylborane]] reacts to give [[superhydride]] (LiBHEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Peter Rittmeyer, Ulrich Wietelmann "Hydrides" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a13_199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In nuclear chemistry and physics===
Lithium hydride (LiH) is sometimes a desirable material for the shielding of [[nuclear reactor]]s, with the isotope [[lithium-7]] (Li-7), and it can be fabricated by casting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Turchi|title=Propulsion techniques: action and reaction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-o9TJa2F4qsC&amp;pg=PA339|accessdate=2 November 2011|date=1998|publisher=AIAA|isbn=978-1-56347-115-5|pages=339–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Frank H. |last=Welch |title= Lithium hydride: A space age shielding material |journal=Nuclear Engineering and Design |volume=26 | issue=3 |date= February 1974 |pages=440–460|doi=10.1016/0029-5493(74)90082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lithium deuteride====
Lithium deuteride, in the form of [[lithium-7]] deuteride, is a good [[Neutron moderator|moderator]] for [[nuclear reactor]]s, because [[deuterium]] (H-2) has a lower [[neutron]] absorption cross-section than ordinary hydrogen (H-1) does, and the cross-section for Li-7 is also low, decreasing the absorption of neutrons in a reactor. Lithium-7 is preferred for a moderator because it has a lower neutron capture cross-section, and it also forms less [[tritium]] (H-3) under bombardment with neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Massie|first1=Mark|last2=Dewan|first2=Leslie C.|title=US 20130083878 A1, April 4, 2013, NUCLEAR REACTORS AND RELATED METHODS AND APPARATUS|url=http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220130083878%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20130083878&amp;RS=DN/20130083878|website=U.S. Patent Office|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=2 June 2016|ref=transatomic_patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The corresponding [[lithium-6]] [[deuterium|deuteride]],  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li&lt;/sup&gt;H, or &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;LiD, is the primary [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] fuel in [[thermonuclear weapon]]s. In hydrogen warheads of the [[Teller–Ulam design]], a [[nuclear fission]] trigger explodes to heat and compress the lithium-6 deuteride, and to bombard the &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;LiD with [[neutron]]s to produce tritium in an [[exothermic]] reaction: Li-6 + n --&gt; He-4 + H-3. The deuterium and tritium (both isotopes of hydrogen) then fuse to produce [[helium]]-4, one neutron, and 17.59&amp;nbsp;MeV of free energy in the form of [[gamma ray]]s, [[kinetic energy]], etc. The helium is an inert byproduct.

Before the [[Castle Bravo]] [[nuclear weapons test]] in 1954, it was thought that only the less common isotope lithium-6 would breed tritium when struck with fast neutrons. The Castle Bravo test showed (accidentally) that the more plentiful lithium-7 also does so under extreme conditions, albeit by an [[endothermic]] reaction.

==Safety==
LiH reacts violently with water to give hydrogen gas and LiOH, which is caustic. Consequently, LiH dust can explode in humid air, or even in dry air due to static electricity. At concentrations of {{nobr|5–55 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} in air the dust is extremely irritating to the mucous membranes and skin and may cause an allergic reaction. Because of the irritation, LiH is normally rejected rather than accumulated by the body.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|157,182}}

Some lithium salts, which can be produced in LiH reactions, are toxic. LiH fire should not be extinguished using carbon dioxide, carbon tetrachloride, or aqueous fire extinguishers; they should be smothered by covering with a metal object or graphite or [[dolomite]] powder. Sand is less suitable, as it can explode when mixed with burning LiH, especially if not dry. LiH is normally transported in oil, using containers made of ceramic, certain plastics or steel, and is handled in an atmosphere of dry argon or helium.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|156}} Nitrogen can be used, but not at elevated temperatures, as it reacts with lithium.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|157}} LiH normally contains some metallic lithium, which corrodes steel or [[silica]] containers at elevated temperatures.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;{{rp|173–174, 179}}

'''Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann''' ({{IPA-de|ˈluːtvɪç ˈbɔlt͡sman}}; February 20, 1844 – September 5, 1906) was an [[Austria|Austrian]] physicist and philosopher whose greatest achievement was in the development of [[statistical mechanics]], which explains and predicts how the properties of [[atom]]s (such as [[atomic mass|mass]], [[electric charge|charge]], and structure) determine the physical properties of [[matter]] (such as viscosity, [[thermal conductivity]], and diffusion).

Boltzmann coined the term [[ergodic]] while he was working on a problem in statistical mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations |last = Walters |year=1982 | loc=§0.1, p.2 |nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- cite lifted from [[ergodic]] without confirmation --&gt;

==Biography==

===Childhood and education===
Boltzmann was born in [[Vienna]], the capital of the [[Austrian Empire]]. His father, Ludwig Georg Boltzmann, was a revenue official. His grandfather, who had moved to Vienna from Berlin, was a clock manufacturer, and Boltzmann's mother, Katharina Pauernfeind, was originally from [[Salzburg]]. He received his primary education from a private tutor at the home of his parents. Boltzmann attended high school in [[Linz]], [[Upper Austria]]. When Boltzmann was 15, his father died.

Boltzmann studied [[physics]] at the [[University of Vienna]], starting in 1863. Among his teachers were [[Johann Josef Loschmidt|Josef Loschmidt]], [[Joseph Stefan]], [[Andreas von Ettingshausen]] and [[Jozef Maximilián Petzval|Jozef Petzval]]. Boltzmann received his PhD degree in 1866 working under the supervision of Stefan; his dissertation was on the [[kinetic theory of gases]]. In 1867 he became a [[Privatdozent]] (lecturer). After obtaining his doctorate degree, Boltzmann worked two more years as Stefan's assistant. It was Stefan  who  introduced Boltzmann to [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell's]] work.

===Academic career===
In 1869 at age 25, thanks to a letter of recommendation written by Stefan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.kvarkadabra.net/2001/12/ludwig-boltzmann/ |title=Ludwig Boltzmann in prva študentka fizike in matematike slovenskega rodu |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Ludwig Boltzmann and the First Student of Physics and Mathematics of Slovene Descent |date=December 2001 |last=Južnič |first=Stanislav |work=Kvarkadabra.net |issue=12 |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was appointed full Professor of [[Mathematical Physics]] at the [[University of Graz]] in the province of [[Styria]]. In 1869 he spent several months in [[Heidelberg]] working with [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Leo Königsberger]] and in 1871 with [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] in Berlin. In 1873 Boltzmann joined the University of Vienna as Professor of Mathematics and there he stayed until 1876.

In 1872, long before women were admitted to Austrian universities, he met Henriette von Aigentler, an aspiring teacher of mathematics and physics in Graz. She was refused permission to audit lectures unofficially. Boltzmann advised her to appeal, which she did, successfully. On July 17, 1876 Ludwig Boltzmann married Henriette; they had three daughters and two sons. Boltzmann went back to [[Graz]] to take up the chair of Experimental Physics. Among his students in Graz were [[Svante Arrhenius]] and [[Walther Nernst]].&lt;ref name="springer"&gt;{{Cite journal |quote=Paul Ehrenfest (1880–1933) along with Nernst, Arrhenius, and Meitner must be considered among Boltzmann's most outstanding students. |last=Jäger |first=Gustav |last2=Nabl |first2=Josef |last3=Meyer |first3=Stephan |date=April 1999 |title=Three Assistants on Boltzmann |journal=Synthese |volume=119 |issue=1–2 |pages=69–84 |doi=10.1023/A:1005239104047}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huji"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/nernst.htm |title=Walther Hermann Nernst |quote=Walther Hermann Nernst visited lectures by Ludwig Boltzmann |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612133921/http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/nernst.htm |archive-date=2008-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent 14 happy years in Graz and it was there that he developed his statistical concept of nature.

Boltzmann was appointed to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the [[University of Munich]] in [[Bavaria]], Germany in 1890.

In 1894, Boltzmann succeeded his teacher [[Joseph Stefan]] as Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Vienna.

===Final years===
Boltzmann spent a great deal of effort in his final years defending his theories. He did not get along with some of his colleagues in Vienna, particularly [[Ernst Mach]], who became a professor of philosophy and history of sciences in 1895. That same year [[Georg Helm]] and [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] presented their position on ''Energetics'' at a meeting in [[Lübeck]]. They saw energy, and not matter, as the chief component of the universe. Boltzmann's position carried the day among other physicists who supported his atomic theories in the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Max Planck|title=Gegen die neure Energetik|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=57|year=1896|pages=72–78|doi=10.1002/andp.18962930107 |bibcode = 1896AnP...293...72P }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, Boltzmann went to the [[University of Leipzig]], on the invitation of [[Wilhelm Ostwald]].&lt;ref&gt;Ostwald offered to Boltzmann the professorial chair of physics which was vacated upon the death of [[Gustav Heinrich Wiedemann]].&lt;/ref&gt; After the retirement of Mach due to bad health, Boltzmann returned to Vienna in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Upon Boltzmann's resignation, [[Theodor des Coudres]] became his successor in the professorial chair at Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 he founded the [[Austrian Mathematical Society]] together with [[Gustav von Escherich]] and [[Emil Müller (mathematician)|Emil Müller]]. His students included [[Karl Přibram|Karl Přibram]], [[Paul Ehrenfest]] and [[Lise Meitner]].

In Vienna, Boltzmann taught physics and also lectured on philosophy. Boltzmann's lectures on [[natural philosophy]] were very popular and received considerable attention. His first lecture was an enormous success. Even though the largest lecture hall had been chosen for it, the people stood all the way down the staircase. Because of the great successes of Boltzmann's philosophical lectures, the Emperor invited him for a reception at the Palace.

In the year 1906 his mental condition became so bad that he had to resign his position. He committed suicide on September 5, 1906 by hanging himself while on vacation with his wife and daughter in [[Duino]], near [[Trieste]] (then Austria).&lt;ref&gt;"Eureka!

:&lt;math&gt;S = k \cdot \log W &lt;/math&gt;

==Philosophy==
Boltzmann's [[kinetic theory of gases]] seemed to presuppose the reality of [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s, but almost all [[German philosophy|German philosophers]] and many scientists like [[Ernst Mach]] and the physical chemist [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] disbelieved their existence. During the 1890s Boltzmann attempted to formulate a compromise position which would allow both atomists and anti-atomists to do physics without arguing over atoms. His solution was to use [[Heinrich Hertz|Hertz]]'s theory that atoms were ''Bilder'', that is, models or pictures. Atomists could think the pictures were the real atoms while the anti-atomists could think of the pictures as representing a useful but unreal model, but this did not fully satisfy either group. Furthermore, Ostwald and many defenders of "pure thermodynamics" were trying hard to refute the kinetic theory of gases and statistical mechanics because of Boltzmann's assumptions about atoms and molecules and especially statistical interpretation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].

Around the turn of the century, Boltzmann's science was being threatened by another philosophical objection. Some physicists, including Mach's student, [[Gustav Jaumann]], interpreted Hertz to mean that all electromagnetic behavior is continuous, as if there were no atoms and molecules, and likewise as if all physical behavior were ultimately electromagnetic. This movement around 1900 deeply depressed Boltzmann since it could mean the end of his kinetic theory and statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics.

After Mach's resignation in Vienna in 1901, Boltzmann returned there and decided to become a philosopher himself to refute philosophical objections to his physics, but he soon became discouraged again. In 1904 at a physics conference in St. Louis most physicists seemed to reject atoms and he was not even invited to the physics section. Rather, he was stuck in a section called "applied mathematics", he violently attacked philosophy, especially on allegedly Darwinian grounds but actually in terms of [[Lamarck]]'s theory of the inheritance of acquired characteristics that people inherited bad philosophy from the past and that it was hard for scientists to overcome such inheritance.

In 1905 Boltzmann corresponded extensively with the Austro-German philosopher [[Franz Brentano]] with the hope of gaining a better mastery of philosophy, apparently, so that he could better refute its relevancy in science, but he became discouraged about this approach as well.

==Physics==
Boltzmann's most important scientific contributions were in [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]], including the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] for molecular speeds in a gas. In addition, [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]] and the [[Boltzmann distribution]] over energies remain the foundations of [[classical mechanics|classical]] statistical mechanics. They are applicable to the many [[phenomenon|phenomena]] that do not require [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics#Limits of applicability|quantum statistics]] and provide a remarkable insight into the meaning of [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]].

[[File:Boltzmanns-molecule.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Boltzmann's 1898 I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule diagram showing atomic "sensitive region" (α, β) overlap.]]
Much of the [[physics]] establishment did not share his belief in the reality of [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s — a belief shared, however, by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] in Scotland and [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]] in the United States; and by [[History of chemistry#The dispute about atomism|most]] [[chemistry|chemists]] since the discoveries of [[John Dalton]] in 1808. He had a long-running dispute with the editor of the preeminent German physics journal of his day, who refused to let Boltzmann refer to atoms and molecules as anything other than convenient [[Theory#Science|theoretical]] constructs. Only a couple of years after Boltzmann's death, [[Jean Baptiste Perrin|Perrin's]] studies of [[colloid]]al suspensions (1908–1909), based on [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[Albert Einstein#Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics|theoretical studies]] of 1905, confirmed the values of [[Avogadro's number]] and [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]], and convinced the world that the tiny particles [[Atomic theory#History|really exist]].

To quote [[Max Planck|Planck]], "The [[logarithm]]ic connection between [[entropy]] and [[probability]] was first stated by L. Boltzmann in his [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases".&lt;ref&gt;Max Planck, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; This famous formula for entropy ''S'' is&lt;ref&gt;The concept of [[entropy]] was introduced by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1865. He was the first to enunciate the [[second law of thermodynamics]] by saying that "entropy always increases".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An alternative is the [[Information entropy#Formal definitions|information entropy]] definition introduced in 1948 by [[Claude Elwood Shannon|Claude Shannon]].[https://archive.is/20070503225307/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/paper.html] It was intended for use in communication theory, but is applicable in all areas. It reduces to Boltzmann's expression when all the probabilities are equal, but can, of course, be used when they are not. Its virtue is that it yields immediate results without resorting to [[factorial]]s or [[Stirling's approximation]]. Similar formulas are found, however, as far back as the work of Boltzmann, and explicitly in [[H-theorem#Quantum mechanical H-theorem|Gibbs]] (see reference).&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; S = k_B \ln W &lt;/math&gt;

where ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]], and ''ln'' is the [[natural logarithm]]. ''W'' is ''Wahrscheinlichkeit'', a German word  meaning the [[probability theory|probability]] of occurrence of a [[macrostate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pauli| first=Wolfgang| title=Statistical Mechanics|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|year=1973|isbn=978-0-262-66035-8}}, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; or, more precisely, the number of possible [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]] corresponding to the macroscopic state of a system — number of (unobservable) "ways" in the (observable) [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] state of a system can be realized by assigning different [[coordinate system|positions]] and [[momentum|momenta]] to the various molecules. Boltzmann's [[Paradigm#Paradigm shifts|paradigm]] was an [[ideal gas]] of ''N'' ''identical'' particles, of which ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are in the ''i''th microscopic condition (range) of position and momentum.  ''W''&amp;nbsp;can be counted using the formula for [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics#A derivation of the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|permutations]]

:&lt;math&gt; W = N! \prod_i \frac{1}{N_i!} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' ranges over all possible molecular conditions. (&lt;math&gt;!&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[factorial]].) The "correction" in the denominator is because identical particles in the same condition are [[Identical particles|indistinguishable]].

Boltzmann was also one of the founders of quantum mechanics due to his suggestion in 1877 that the energy levels of a physical system could be discrete.

The equation for ''S'' is engraved on Boltzmann's [[headstone|tombstone]] at the Vienna [[Zentralfriedhof]] — his second grave.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Zentralfriedhof_Vienna_-_Boltzmann.JPG]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boltzmann equation==
[[File:Ludwig Boltzmann at U Vienna.JPG|thumb|Boltzmann's bust in the courtyard arcade of the main building, University of Vienna.]]
{{main|Boltzmann equation}}

The Boltzmann equation was developed to describe the dynamics of an ideal gas.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}+ v \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+ \frac{F}{m} \frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\left.{\!\!\frac{}{}}\right|_\mathrm{collision} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ƒ'' represents the distribution function of single-particle position and momentum at a given time (see the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]), ''F'' is a force, ''m'' is the mass of a particle, ''t'' is the time and ''v'' is an average velocity of particles.

This equation describes the [[time|temporal]] and [[space|spatial]] variation of the probability distribution for the position and momentum of a density distribution of a cloud of points in single-particle [[phase space]]. (See [[Hamiltonian mechanics]].) The first term on the left-hand side represents the explicit time variation of the distribution function, while the second term gives the spatial variation, and the third term describes the effect of any force acting on the particles. The right-hand side of the equation represents the effect of collisions.

In principle, the above equation completely describes the dynamics of an ensemble of gas particles, given appropriate [[boundary conditions]]. This first-order [[differential equation]] has a deceptively simple appearance, since ''ƒ'' can represent an arbitrary single-particle distribution function. Also, the [[force]] acting on the particles depends directly on the velocity distribution function&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''. The Boltzmann equation is notoriously difficult to [[Integral|integrate]]. [[David Hilbert]] spent years trying to solve it without any real success.

The form of the collision term assumed by Boltzmann was approximate. However, for an ideal gas the standard [[Chapman–Enskog theory|Chapman–Enskog]] solution of the Boltzmann equation is highly accurate. It is expected to lead to incorrect results for an ideal gas only under [[shock wave]] conditions.

Boltzmann tried for many years to "prove" the [[second law of thermodynamics]] using his gas-dynamical equation — his famous [[H-theorem]]. However the key assumption he made in formulating the collision term was "[[molecular chaos]]", an assumption which breaks [[CPT symmetry|time-reversal symmetry]] as is necessary for ''anything'' which could imply the second law. It was from the probabilistic assumption alone that Boltzmann's apparent success emanated, so his long dispute with [[Johann Josef Loschmidt|Loschmidt]] and others over [[Loschmidt's paradox]] ultimately ended in his failure.

Finally, in the 1970s [[E. G. D. Cohen]] and J. R. Dorfman proved that a systematic (power series) extension of the Boltzmann equation to high densities is mathematically impossible. Consequently, [[non-equilibrium statistical mechanics|nonequilibrium statistical mechanics]] for dense gases and liquids focuses on the [[Green–Kubo relations]], the [[fluctuation theorem]], and other approaches instead.

==Second thermodynamics law as a law of disorder==
[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Boltzmann.JPG|thumb|right|Boltzmann's grave in the [[Zentralfriedhof]], Vienna, with bust and entropy formula.]]
The idea that the [[second law of thermodynamics]] or "entropy law" is a law of disorder (or that dynamically ordered states are "infinitely improbable") is due to Boltzmann's view of the second law of thermodynamics.

In particular, it was Boltzmann's attempt to reduce it to a [[stochastic]] collision function, or law of probability following from the random collisions of mechanical particles. Following Maxwell,&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J. (1871). Theory of heat. London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Boltzmann modeled gas molecules as colliding billiard balls in a box, noting that with each collision nonequilibrium velocity distributions (groups of molecules moving at the same speed and in the same direction) would become increasingly disordered leading to a final state of macroscopic uniformity and maximum microscopic disorder or the state of maximum entropy (where the macroscopic uniformity corresponds to the obliteration of all field potentials or gradients).&lt;ref&gt;Boltzmann, L. (1974). The second law of thermodynamics. Populare Schriften, Essay 3, address to a formal meeting of the Imperial Academy of Science, 29 May 1886, reprinted in Ludwig Boltzmann, Theoretical physics and philosophical problem, S. G. Brush (Trans.). Boston: Reidel. (Original work published 1886)&lt;/ref&gt; The second law, he argued, was thus simply the result of the fact that in a world of mechanically colliding particles disordered states are the most probable. Because there are so many more possible disordered states than ordered ones, a system will almost always be found either in the state of maximum disorder – the macrostate with the greatest number of accessible microstates such as a gas in a box at equilibrium – or moving towards it. A dynamically ordered state, one with molecules moving "at the same speed and in the same direction", Boltzmann  concluded, is thus "the most improbable case conceivable...an infinitely improbable configuration of energy." &lt;ref&gt;Boltzmann, L. (1974). The second law of thermodynamics. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Boltzmann accomplished the feat of showing that the second law of thermodynamics is only a statistical fact. The gradual disordering of energy is analogous to the disordering of an initially ordered [[pack of cards]] under repeated shuffling, and just as the cards will finally return to their original order if shuffled a gigantic number of times, so the entire universe must some-day regain, by pure chance, the state from which it first set out. (This optimistic coda to the idea of the dying universe becomes somewhat muted when one attempts to estimate the timeline which will probably elapse before it spontaneously occurs.)&lt;ref&gt;"[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]", Volume 19 Phyfe to Reni, "Physics", by David Park, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The tendency for entropy increase seems to cause difficulty to beginners in thermodynamics, but is easy to understand from the standpoint of the theory of probability. Consider two ordinary [[dice]], with both sixes face up. After the dice are shaken, the chance of finding these two sixes face up is small (1 in 36); thus one can say that the random motion (the agitation) of the dice, like the chaotic collisions of molecules because of thermal energy, causes the less probable state to change to one that is more probable. With millions of dice, like the millions of atoms involved in thermodynamic calculations, the probability of their all being sixes becomes so vanishingly small that the system ''must'' move to one of the more probable states.&lt;ref&gt;"Collier's Encyclopedia", Volume 22 Sylt to Uruguay, Thermodynamics, by Leo Peters, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; However, mathematically the odds of all the dice results not being a pair sixes is also as hard as the ones of all of them being sixes, and since statistically the [[data]] tend to balance, one in every 36 pairs of dice will tend to be a pair of sixes, and the cards -when shuffled- will sometimes present a certain temporary sequence order even if in its whole the deck was disordered.

The '''Mobile Electronics Rocket-6A''' or '''MER-6A,''' '''Emergency Rocket Communications System''' ('''ERCS''') provided a reliable and survivable emergency communications method for the [[United States]] [[National Command Authority]], using a [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] repeater placed atop a [[Scout (rocket family)|Blue Scout]] rocket.

==Operations==
The [[Scout (rocket family)|Blue Scout]] version of ERCS (Program 279) was deployed to three sites near [[Wisner, Nebraska|Wisner]], [[West Point, Nebraska|West Point]], and [[Tekamah, Nebraska|Tekamah]], Nebraska.

'''Michael Sladek''' (born 1947) is a [[Germany|German]] doctor and bearer of the [[Bundesverdienstkreuz]].

He became famous by realising a grid-independent system for producing electricity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://worldblog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/05/31/6756761-german-couple-make-greenbacks-in-anti-nuke-battle-|title=World Blog - German couple make greenbacks in anti-nuke battle|last=Eckardt|first=Andy|date=May 20, 2011|work=[[MSN]]|accessdate=1 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602161213/http://worldblog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/05/31/6756761-german-couple-make-greenbacks-in-anti-nuke-battle-|archivedate=2 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=1538|title=Peaceful Rebels|date=November 2008|work=[[The Atlantic Times]]|accessdate=1 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819000301/http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=1538|archivedate=19 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by distributed little power plants. 
For this he was awarded 1996 by the German magazine ''Capital''  with the Capital/ WWF - Umweltpreis. In 1999 he and his wife [[Ursula Sladek]] were awarded with the [[Nuclear-Free Future Award]]. In January 2004 the Sladek couple was awarded the highest order in Germany, the Bundesverdienstkreuz, for their great engagement for the environment.

With his system that combines an efficiency-strategy with a power saving strategy it became possible to satisfy the power consumption of the community [[Schönau im Schwarzwald|Schönau in the Black-Forest]]. 
Following his engagement supported by his wife and many friends the first German green power-provider came into existence, the [[EWS Schönau]].
The community of Schönau was the first community on Earth in a Western civilised country that became independent of the national power grid and could decide how the power will be produced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28019">An '''organogel''' is a class of [[gel]] composed of a liquid [[organic compound|organic]] phase within a three-dimensional, [[cross-linked]] network. Organogel networks can form in two ways. The first is classic gel network formation via [[polymerization]]. This mechanism converts a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] solution of monomers with various reactive sites into polymeric chains that grow into a single covalently-linked network. At a critical concentration (the gel point), the polymeric network becomes large enough so that on the macroscopic scale, the solution starts to exhibit [[gel]]-like physical properties: an extensive continuous solid network, no steady-state flow, and solid-like [[rheology|rheological]] properties.&lt;ref name="Raghavan"&gt;Raghavan, S.R.; Douglas, J.F. Soft Matter. 2012, 8, 8539.&lt;/ref&gt; However, organogels that are “[[Low Molecular-Mass Organic Gelators|low molecular weight gelators]]” can also be designed to form gels via [[self-assembly]]. Secondary forces, such as [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]] or [[hydrogen bonding]], cause monomers to cluster into a non-covalently bonded network that retains organic solvent, and as the network grows, it exhibits gel-like physical properties.&lt;ref name="Hirst2"&gt;Hirst, A.R.; Coates, I.A.; Boucheteau, T.R.; Miravet, J.F.; Escuder, B.; Castelletto, V.; Hamley, I.W.; Smith, D.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008, 130, 9113-9121.&lt;/ref&gt; Both gelation mechanisms lead to gels characterized as organogels.

Gelation mechanism greatly influences the typical organogel properties. Since precursors with multiple functional groups polymerize into networks of covalent C-C bonds (on average 85 kcal/mol), networks formed by self-assembly, which relies on secondary forces (generally less than 10 kcal/mol), are less stable.&lt;ref name="Ege"&gt;Ege, S. N. Organic Chemistry Structure and Reactivity, 5th ed.; Cengage Learning: Mason, Ohio, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Sinnokrot"&gt;Sinnokrot, M.O.; Sherrill, C.D. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2006, 110, 10656.&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists also have difficulties predicting characteristic gelation parameters, such as gel point and gelation time, with a single and simple equation. Gel point, the transition point from a polymer solution to gel, is a function of the extent of reaction or the fraction of functional groups reacted. Gelation time is the time interval between the onset of reaction– by heating, addition of catalyst into a liquid system, etc.– and gel point. Kinetic and statistical mathematical theories have had moderate success in predicting gelation parameters; a simple, accurate, and widely applicable theory has not yet been developed.

This article will first discuss the details of organogels formation and the variables of the characteristic gelation parameters as they relate to organogels. Then, various methods used to characterize organogels will be explained. Finally, we will review the use of organogels in various industries.

==Organogel formulation==
The formulation of an accurate theory of gel formation that correctly predicts gelation parameters (such as time, rate, and structure) of a broad range of materials is highly sought after for both commercial and intellectual reasons. As noted earlier, researchers often judge gel theories based upon their ability to accurately predict gel points. The kinetic and statistical methods model gel formation with different mathematical approaches. {{As of|2014}} most researchers used statistical methods, as the equations derived thereby are less cumbersome and contain variables to which specific physical meanings can be attached, thus aiding in the analysis of gel formation theory.&lt;ref name="Pizzi"&gt;Pizzi, A.; Mittal, K. L. Handbook of Adhesive Technology, 2nd ed.; Marcel Dekker, Inc.: New York, 200; Chap. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Below, we present the classical Flory-Stockmayer (FS) statistical theory for gel formation. This theory, despite its simplicity, has found widespread use. This is due in large part to small increases in accuracy provided by the use of more complicated methods, and to its being a general model which can be applied to many gelation systems. Other gel formation theories cased on different chemical approximations have also been derived. However, the FS model has better simplicity, wide applicability, and accuracy, and remains the most used.

===The kinetic approach===
The kinetic (or coagulation) approach preserves the integrity of any and all structures created during network formation. Thus, an infinite set of differential rate equations (one for each possible structure, of which there essentially infinite) must be created in order to treat gel systems kinetically. Consequently, exact solutions for kinetic theories can be obtained for only the most basic systems.&lt;ref name="Dusek"&gt;Dusek, K.; Kuchanov, S. I.; Panyukov, S. V. In Polymer Networks ’91; Dusek, K and Kuchanov, S. I., eds.; VSP: Utrecht, 1992; Chap. 1, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, numerical answers to kinetic systems can be given via [[Monte Carlo method]]s. In general, kinetic treatments of gelation result in large, unwieldy, and dense sets of equations that give answers not discernibly better than those given by the statistical approach. A major drawback of the kinetic approach is that it treats the gel as essentially one giant, rigid molecule, and cannot actively simulate characteristic structures of gels such as elastic and dangling chains.&lt;ref name=Dusek /&gt; Kinetic models have mostly fallen out of use given how clumsy the equations become in everyday use. Interested readers however, are directed to the following papers for further reading on a specific kinetic model.&lt;ref name="Smoluchowski"&gt;Smoluchowski, M.V. Z. Phys. Chem. 1916, 92, 129-168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Souge"&gt;Souge, J. L. Analytic solutions to Smoluchowski’s coagulation equation: a combinatorial inter-pretation. J. Phys. A.: Math. Gen. 1985, 18, 3063.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikos"&gt;Mikos, A.; Takoudis, C.; Peppas, N. Kinetic modeling of copolymerization/crosslinking reac-tions. Macromolecules. 1986, 19, 2174-2182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The statistical approach===
The statistical approach views the phase change from liquid to gel as a uniform process throughout the fluid. That is, polymerization reactions are occurring all throughout the solution, with each reaction having an equal chance of occurring. Statistical theories try to determine the fraction of the total possible bonds that need to be made before an infinite polymer network can appear. The classic statistical theory first developed by Flory rested on two critical assumptions.&lt;ref name="Tobita"&gt;Tobita, H.; Hamielec, A. A kinetic model for network formation in free radical polymerization. Makromol. Chem. Makromol. Symp. 1988, 20/21, 501-543.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Plate"&gt;Plate, N. A.; Noah, O. V. A theoretical consideration of the kinetics and statistics of reactions of functional groups of macromolecules. Adv. Polym. Sci. 1979, 31, 133-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

#No intramolecular reactions occur. That is, no cyclic molecules form during polymerization lead-ing up to gelation.
#Every reactive unit has the same reactivity regardless of other factors. For example, a reactive group A on a 20-mer (a polymer with 20 monomer units) has the same reactivity as another group A on a 2000-mer.

Using the above assumptions, let us examine a homopolymerization reaction starting from a single monomer with z-functional groups with a fraction p of all possible bonds already having been formed. The polymer we create follows the form of a Cayley tree or Bethe lattice – known from the field of statistical mechanics. The number of branches from each node is determined by the amount of functional groups, z, on our monomer. As we follow the tree’s branches we want there to always be at least one path that leads onwards, as this is the condition of an infinite network polymer. At each node, there are z-1 possible paths, since one functional group was used to create the node. The probability that at least one of the possible paths has been created is (z-1)p. Since we want an infinite network, we require on average that (z-1)p ≥ 1 to ensure an infinitely long path. Therefore, the FS model predicts the critical point (p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) to be:

{{Center|&lt;math&gt;p_{\text{c}} = \frac {1}{z - 1}&lt;/math&gt;}}
&lt;br /&gt;
Physically, p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the fraction of all possible bonds that can be made. So a p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; of ½ means that the first point in time that an infinite network will be able to exist will be when ½ of all possible bonds have been made by the monomers.

This equation is derived for the simple case of a self-reacting monomer with a single type of reacting group A. The Flory model was further refined by Stockmayer to include multifunctional monomers.&lt;ref name="Bowman"&gt;Bowman, C. N.; Peppas, N. A. A kinetic gelation method for the simulation of free-radical polymerizations. Chemical Engineering Science. 1992, 47, 1411-1419.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same two assumptions were kept. Thus, the classical statistical gel theory has come to be known as the Flory-Stockmayer (FS). The FS model gives the following equations for a bifunctional polymer system, and can be generalized to branch units of any amount of functionality following the steps laid out by Stockmayer.&lt;ref name=Bowman /&gt;

{{Center|&lt;math&gt;p_{\text{A}} \cdot p_{\text{B}} = \frac {1}{r \cdot (f_{\text{A}} - 1) (f_{\text{B}} - 1)}&lt;/math&gt;}}
&lt;br /&gt;
Where p&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; are the fraction of all possible A and B bonds respectively and r (which must be less than 1) is the ratio of reactive sites of A and B on each monomer. If the starting concentrations of A and B reactive sites are the same, then p&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; can be condensed to p&lt;sub&gt;gel&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and values for the fraction of all bonds at which an infinite network will form can be found.

{{Center|&lt;math&gt;f_{\text{A}} = \frac {\sum_{i}(f_{\text{Ai}}^2\, \cdot N_{\text{Ai}})}{\sum_{i}(f_{\text{Ai}} \cdot N_{\text{Ai}})}&lt;/math&gt;}}
&lt;br /&gt;
f&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; are defined as above, where N&lt;sub&gt;Ai&lt;/sub&gt; are the number of moles of Ai containing f&lt;sub&gt;Ai&lt;/sub&gt; functional groups for each type of A functional molecule.

==Factors affecting gelation==
Typically, gels are synthesized via [[sol-gel#Polymerization|sol-gel processing]], a wet-chemical technique involving a colloidal solution (sol) that acts as the precursor for an integrated network (gel). There are two possible mechanisms whereby organogels form depending on the physical intermolecular inter-actions, namely the fluid-filled fiber and the solid fiber mechanism.&lt;ref name="Sahoo"&gt;Sahoo. S; Kumar, N. et al. Organogels: Properties and applications in drug delivery. Designed Monomers and Polymers. 2011, 14, 95-108.&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference is in the starting materials, i.e. [[surfactant]] in apolar solvent versus solid organogelator in apolar solvent. Surfactant or surfactant mixture forms [[micelle#Inverse/reverse micelles|reverse micelles]] when mixed with an apolar solvent. The fluid-fiber matrix forms when a polar solvent (e.g. water) is added to the reverse micelles to encourage the formation of tubular reverse micelle structures.&lt;ref name=Sahoo /&gt; As more polar solvent is added, the reverse micelles elongate and entangle to form organogel. Gel formation via solid-fiber matrix, on the other hand, forms when the mixture of organogelators in apolar solvent is heated to give apolar solution of organogelator and then cooled down below the solubility limit of the organogelators.&lt;ref name="Koshima"&gt;Koshima, H.; Matsusaka, W. Yu, H. Preparation and photoreaction of organogels based on ben-zophenone. J. Photochemistry and Photobiology A. 2003, 156, 83-90.&lt;/ref&gt; The organogelators precipitate out as fibers, forming a 3-dimensional network which then immobilizes the apolar solvent to produce organogels.&lt;ref name=Sahoo /&gt; Table 1 lists the type of organogelators and the properties of the organogels synthesized.

Gelation times vary depending on the organogelators and medium. One can promote or delay gelation by influencing the molecular [[self-assembly]] of organogelators in a system.
Molecular self-assembly is a process by which molecules adopt a defined arrangement without guidance or management from an external source. The organogelators may undergo physical or chemical interactions so as to form self-assembled fibrous structures in which they become entangled with each other, resulting in the formation of a three-dimensional network structure.&lt;ref name=Sahoo /&gt; It is believed that the self-assembly is governed by non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic forces, van der Waals forces, π-π interactions etc. Although molecular self-assembly is not fully understood so far, researchers have demonstrated by adjusting certain aspects of the system, one is able to promote or inhibit self-assembly in organogelator molecules.

:Factors affecting gelation include but are not limited to:
:*Molecular structures of organogelators – e.g. chirality, functional groups
:*Properties of medium – pH, solvent-molecule interaction or solubility, temperature and solvent chain length.&lt;ref name="Chen26"&gt;Chen, J.; McNeil, A. J. Analyte-triggered gelation: Initiating self-assembly via oxidation-induced planarization. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008, 130, 16496-16497.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Salehi"&gt;Salehi et al. The effect of salinity and pH on gelation time of polymer gels using central compo-site design method. Presented at International Symposium of the Society of Core Analysts held in Austin, Texas, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organogelators can be divided into two groups based on whether or not they form hydrogen bonds.&lt;ref name=Sahoo /&gt; Hydrogen bond forming organogelators include, amino acids/amides/urea moieties and carbohydrates whereas non-hydrogen bond forming organogelators (e.g. π-π stacking) include anthracene-, anthraquinone- and steroid-based molecules.&lt;ref name="Plourde"&gt;Plourde, F. et al. First report on the efficacy of l-alanine-based in situ-forming implants for the long-term parenteral delivery of drugs. J. Controlled Release, 2005. 108, 433-441.&lt;/ref&gt;
Solubility and/or solvent-molecule interactions play an important role in promoting organogelator self-assembly.&lt;ref name="Hirst28"&gt;Hirst et al. Low-Molecular-Weight Gelators: Elucidating the Principles of Gelation Based on Gelator Solubility and a Cooperative Self-Assembly Model. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008, 130, 9113–9121.&lt;/ref&gt; Hirst et al.&lt;ref name=Hirst28 /&gt; showed that the solubility of the gelators in media can be modified by tuning the peripheral protecting groups of the gelators, which in turn controls the gel point and the concentrations at which crosslinking takes place (See Table 2 for data). Gelators that have higher solubility in medium show less preference for crosslinking. These gelators (Figure 1) are less effective and require higher total concentrations to initiate the process. In addition, solvent-molecule interactions also modulate the level of self-assembly. This was shown by Hirst et al. in the NMR binding model as well as in [[small angle neutron scattering|SAXS/SANS]] results.&lt;ref name=Hirst28 /&gt;
Garner et al.&lt;ref name=Garner /&gt; explored the importance of organogelator structures using 4-tertbutyl-1-aryl cy-clohexanol derivatives showing that a phenyl group in an axial configuration induces gelation, unlike derivatives with the phenyl group in equatorial configuration.&lt;ref name=Garner /&gt; Polymeric organogelators can induce gelation even at very low concentrations (less than 20 g/L) and the self-assembly capability could be customized by modifying the chemical structure of the polymer backbone.&lt;ref name="Suzuki29"&gt;Suzuki, M., and K.

By manipulating the solvent-molecule interactions, one can promote molecular self-assembly of the organogelator and therefore gelation. Although this is the traditionally used approach, it has limitations. There are still no reliable models that describe the gelation for all kinds of organogelators in all media. An alternate approach is to promote self-assembly by triggering changes in intermolecular interactions, i.e. cis-trans isomerization, hydrogen bonding, donor-acceptor π-π stacking interaction, electrostatic interactions etc. Matsumoto et al.&lt;ref name="Matsumoto"&gt;Matsumoto, S.; Yamaguchi, S.; Ueno, S.; Komatsu, H.; Ikeda, M.; Ishizuka, K.; Iko, Y.; Tabata, K. V.; Aoki, H.; Ito, S.; Noji, H.; Hamachi, I. Photo Gel–Sol/Sol–Gel Transition and its Patterning of a Supramolecular Hydrogel as Stimuli-Responsive Biomaterials. J. Chem.

J. 2005, 11, 5496–5508.&lt;/ref&gt; have reported gelation using light-induced isomerization and by incorporating additives into the system to influence molecular packing, respectively.

Matsumoto et al.&lt;ref name=Matsumoto /&gt; used UV light to trigger trans–cis photoisomerization of fumaric amide units causing self-assembly or disassembly to a gel or the corresponding sol, respectively (See Figure 2). Hirst et al., on the other hand, introduced a two-component system, where inserting a second component into the system changed the gelator’s behavior.&lt;ref name=Hirst32 /&gt; This had effectively controlled the molecular self-assembly process. [[File:Photoisometization.jpg|thumbnail|left|'''Figure 2.''' An example of cis-trans photoisomerization process when the molecule is illuminated. The effect of illumination to the molecules is also shown micro- as well as macroscopically. Adapted from Matsumoto et al.&lt;ref name=Matsumoto /&gt;]]

Chen et al.&lt;ref name="Chen26"/&gt; designed a system that would undergo self-assembly by triggering changes in intermolecular interactions. They used an oxidation-induced planarization to trigger gelator self-assembly and gelation through donor-acceptor π-stacking interaction.&lt;ref name=Chen26 /&gt; The interesting part is that both strong oxidants such as cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate and weak oxidants like nitric oxide, NO can induce gelation. Figure 3 shows the oxidation of dihydropyridine catalyzed/induced by NO. NO has been used as an analyte or biomarker for disease detection, and the discovery of NO’s role in analyte-triggered gelation system no doubt has opened new doors to the world of chemical sensing.

==Characterization==
Gels are characterized from two different perspectives. First, the physical structure of the gel is determined. This is followed by a characterization of the gel’s mechanical properties. The former generally affects the mechanical properties of gels.

===Physical Characterization===

====Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)====
This is a reliable technique for measuring the strength of the intermolecular interactions in gels. Gel network strength is proportional to the magnitude of enthalpy change (ΔH). A higher ΔH means a more tightly bonded network while a smaller enthalpy value means a network made of weaker bonds.&lt;ref name="Watase"&gt;Watase, M.; Nakatani, Y.; Itagaki, H. J. Phys. Chem. B.. 1999, 103, 2366-2373&lt;/ref&gt;

====Microscopy====
There are numerous microscopy methods for defining gel structures which include SEM and TEM. Use of microscopic techniques can directly determine the physical parameters of the gel matrix.  These include measurements of pore diameter, wall thickness and shape of the gel network.&lt;ref name="Blank"&gt;Blank, Z.; Reimschuessel, A. C. Journal of Material Science. 1974, 9, 1815-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of SEM can distinguish between gels that have a fibrous network as opposed to those that have a three-dimensional cross linked structure. It must be noted that microscopy techniques may not yield quantitatively accurate results. If a high vacuum is used during imaging, the liquid solvent can be removed from the gel matrix-inducing strain to the gel which leads to physical deformation. Use of an environmental SEM, which operates at higher pressures, can yield higher quality imaging.

====Scattering====
Two scattering techniques for indirectly measuring gel parameters are [[small angle X-ray scattering]] (SARS/SAXS) and [[small angle neutron scattering]] (SANS). SARS works exactly like [[X-ray scattering techniques|X-ray scattering]] (XRD) except small angles (0.1-10.0 °) are used. The challenge with small angles is in separating the scattering pattern from the main beam. In SANS, the procedure is the same as SARS except that a neutron beam is used instead of an x-ray beam. One advantage of using a neutron beam as opposed to an x-ray beam is an increased signal to noise ratio. It also provides the ability for isotope labeling because the neutrons interact with the nuclei instead of the electrons. By analyzing the scattering pattern direct information about the size of the material can be obtained. Both SARS and SANS provide useful data on the atomic scale at 50-250 and 10-1000 Å respectively. These distances are perfectly suited for studying the physical parameters of gels.

===Mechanical properties characterization===
There are numerous methods to characterize the material properties of a gel.  These are briefly summarized below.

====Ball indentation====
Hardness or stiffness of the gel is measured by placing a metal ball on top of the material and the hardness of the material depends on the amount of indentation caused by the ball.&lt;ref name="Gau"&gt;Gautreau, Z.; Griffen, J.; Peterson, T.; Thongpradit, P. Characterizing Viscoelastic Properties of Polyacrylamide Gels. Qualifying Report Project, Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atomic force microscopy====
This technique utilizes a similar approach when compared to ball indentation only on a significantly small scale. The tip is lowered into the sample and a laser reflecting off the cantilever allows for precise measurements to be obtained.&lt;ref name=Gau /&gt;

====Uniaxial tensile testing====
In this technique, the tensile strength of the gel is measured in one direction. The two important measurements to make include the force applied per unit area and the amount of elongation under a known applied force. This test provides information for how a gel will respond when an external force is applied.&lt;ref name=Gau /&gt;

====Viscoelasticity====
Due to varying degrees of cross-linkage in a gel network, different gels display different visocoelastic properties. A material containing viscoelastic properties undergoes both viscous and elastic changes when a deformation occurs. Viscosity can be thought of as a time dependent process of a material deforming to a more relaxed state while elasticity is an instantaneous process. The viscoelastic properties of gels mean that they undergo time dependent structural changes in response to a physical deformation. Two techniques for measuring viscoelasticity are broadband viscoelastic spectroscopy (BVS) and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS). In both techniques, a damping mechanism is resolved with both differing frequency and time in order to determine the viscoelastic properties of the material.&lt;ref name=Gau /&gt;

==Applications==
Organogels are useful in applications such as:

==Organometallic chemistry==
In [[organometallic chemistry]], the pentadienyl anion is a ligand, the acyclic analogue of the more common [[cyclopentadienyl]].  It is generated by deprotonation of pentadiene.  A number of complexes are known, including the analogue of ferrocene, Fe(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

More common is the dimethyl analogue 2,4-Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.  Additionally, many pentadienyl ligands are cyclic, being derived from the addition of hydride to ''η''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-arene complexes or hydride abstraction from [[cyclohexadiene]] complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Lothar Stahl, Richard D. Ernst|title=Pentadienyl Complexes of the Group 4 Transition Metals|journal=Advances in Organometallic Chemistry|volume=55|year=2007|pages=137–199|doi=10.1016/S0065-3055(07)55003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richard D.

The first pentadienyl complex to be reported was derived from protonolysis of a complex of pentadienol:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pentadienyl and Hexadienyl Carbonium Ions as Ligands in Stable Complex Cations|authors=Mahler, J.

:Fe(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;OH)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;   →    [Fe(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Treatment of this cation with [[sodium borohydride]] gives the pentadiene complex:
:[Fe(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;   →    Fe(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

==Organic chemistry==
In organic chemistry, the pentadienyl radical, {{chem|C|5|H|7|•}}, is of some significance as an especially stabilized radical.  The radical is delocalized over five carbon centers. Consequently the C−H bond in the diene (C''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) is especially weak. Fats derivatives containing this "doubly [[allylic]]" group are collectively called [[drying oil]]s.  They tend to polymerize in a useful way upon exposure to air.

==Biochemistry==
[[Cyclooxygenase]]s ("COX") are [[enzyme]]s that generate [[prostanoid]]s, including [[thromboxane]] and [[prostaglandin]]s such as [[prostacyclin]].  [[Aspirin]] and [[ibuprofen]] exert their effects through inhibition of COX.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9760">A '''power optimizer''' is a [[DC to DC converter]] technology developed to maximize the energy harvest from solar [[photovoltaic]] or [[wind turbine]] systems. They do this by individually tuning the performance of the panel or wind turbine through [[maximum power point tracking]], and optionally tuning the output to match the performance of the [[string inverter]]. Power optimizers are especially useful when the performance of the power generating components in a distributed system will vary widely, such as due to differences in equipment, shading of light or wind, or being installed facing different directions or widely separated locations.

Power optimizers for solar applications can be similar to [[microinverter]]s in that both systems attempt to isolate individual panels in order to improve overall system performance. A [[smart module]] is a power optimizer integrated into a solar module.  A microinverter essentially combines a power optimizer with a small inverter in a single enclosure that is used on every panel, while the power optimizer leaves the inverter in a separate box and uses only one inverter for the entire array. The claimed advantage to this "hybrid" approach is lower overall system costs, avoiding the distribution of electronics.

==Description==
===Maximum power point tracking (MPPT)===
{{broader|Maximum power point tracking}}

Most energy production or storage devices have a complex relationship between the power they produce, the load placed on them, and the efficiency of the delivery. A conventional battery, for instance, stores energy in chemical reactions in its electrolytes and plates. These reactions take time to occur, which limits the rate at which the power can be efficiently drawn from the cell.&lt;ref&gt;Venkat Srinivasan, [http://gigaom.com/cleantech/the-three-laws-of-batteries-and-a-bonus-zeroth-law/ "The Three Laws of Batteries"], GigaOm, 18 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, large batteries used for power storage generally list two or more capacities, normally the "2 hour" and "20 hour" rates, with the 2 hour rate often being around 50% of the 20 hour rate.

[[Image:Solar-Cell-IV-curve-with-MPP.png|thumb|Typical cell I-V curves showing the relationship between current, voltage and total output for differing amounts of incoming light.]]

Solar panels have similar issues due to the speed at which the cell can convert solar [[photon]]s into [[electron]]s, ambient temperature, and a host of other issues. In this case there is a complex non-linear relationship between voltage, current and the total amount of power being produced, the "I-V curve".&lt;ref&gt;N. Shenck, [http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~nate/AES/PV_Theory_II.pdf "PV Power Systems: PV Theory II"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719205838/http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~nate/AES/PV_Theory_II.pdf |date=2010-07-19 }}, MIT&lt;/ref&gt; In order to optimize collection, modern solar arrays use a technique known as "[[maximum power point tracking]]" (MPPT) to monitor the total output of the array and continually adjust the presented load to keep the system operation at its peak efficiency point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovativesolar.com/images/File/BSE_What_is_MPPT.pdf "What is Maximum Power Point Tracking and How Does it Work?"], BlueSky Energy&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, solar panels produce voltages around 30&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backwoodssolar.com/catalog/Spec_Sheets/SolarWorld_245_Spec.pdf SolarWorld's SW 245] is a typical modern panel, using 6" cells in a 6 by 10 arrangement and a &lt;math&gt;V_{oc}&lt;/math&gt; of 30.8&amp;nbsp;V&lt;/ref&gt; This is too low to be effectively converted into [[alternating current|AC]] to feed to the [[power grid]]. To address this, panels are strung together in series to increase the voltage to something more appropriate for the inverter being used, typically about 600&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sma-america.com/en_US/products/grid-tied-inverters/sunny-boy/sunny-boy-3000-us-3800-us-4000-us.html SMA's SunnyBoy] series comes in US and European versions, and generally suggest 500 to 600&amp;nbsp;VDC inputs.&lt;/ref&gt;

The drawback to this approach is that MPPT system can only be applied to the array as a whole. Because the I-V curve is non-linear, a panel that is even slightly shadowed can have dramatically lower output, and greatly increase its internal resistance. As the panels are wired in series, this would cause the output of the entire string to be reduced due to the increased total resistance. This change in performance causes the MPPT system to change the operation point, moving the rest of the panels away from their best performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eiqenergy.com/parallel_solar/increase_power.php "Increase Power Production"], eIQ Energy&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their sequential wiring, power mismatch between PV modules within a string can lead to a drastic and disproportionate loss of power from the entire solar array, in some cases leading to complete system failure.&lt;ref&gt;Chaintreuil, N. et al. “Effects of Shadow on Grid Connected PV System” INES R.D.I. Laboratory for Solar Systems (L2S), Le Bourget-du-Lac, France. Bruendlinger, R. et al. “Maximum Power Point Tracking Performance Under {{sic|hide=y|Partially|-}}Shaded PV Array Conditions” Paper submitted to the 21st European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference, 4–8 September 2008, Dresden, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; Shading of as little as 9% of the entire surface array of a PV system can, in some circumstances, lead to a system-wide power loss of as much as 54%.&lt;ref&gt;Muenster, R. [“Shade Happens”] Renewable Energy World.com http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/02/shade-happens-54551  2009-02-02. Retrieved on 2009-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this problem is most notable with "large" events like a passing shadow, even the tiniest differences in panel performance, due to dirt, differential aging or tiny differences during manufacturing, can make the array as a whole operate away from its best MPPT point. "Panel matching" is an important part of solar array design.

=== Isolating panels ===
These problems have led to a number of different potential solutions that isolate panels individually or into much smaller groups (2 to 3 panels) in an effort to provide MPPT that avoids the problems of large strings.

One solution, the [[microinverter]], places the entire power conversion system directly on the back of each panel. This allows the system to track the MPPT for each panel, and directly output AC power that matches the grid. The panels are then wired together in parallel, so even the failure of one of the panels or microinverters will not lead to a loss of power from the string. However, this approach has the disadvantage of distributing the power conversion circuitry, which, in theory, is the expensive part of the system. Microinverters, at least as late as early 2011, had significantly higher [[price per watt]].

This leads, naturally, to the power optimizer concept, where only the MPPT system is distributed to the panels. In this case the conversion from DC to AC takes place in a single inverter, one that lacks the MPPT hardware or has it disabled. Advanced solutions are able to work correctly with all solar inverters, to make possible optimisation of already installed plants. According to its supporters, this "hybrid" approach produces the lowest-cost solution overall, while still maintaining the advantages of the microinverter approach.

=== Implementation ===

Power optimizers are essentially [[DC-DC converter]]s, taking the DC power from a solar panel at whatever voltage and current is optimal (via MPPT), then converting that to a different voltage and current that best suits the central / [[string inverter]].

Some power optimizers are designed to work in conjunction with a central inverter from the same manufacturer, which allows the inverter to communicate with the optimizers to ensure that the inverter always receives the same total voltage from the panel string.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.solaredge.com/sites/default/files/se_application_fixed_string_voltage.pdf SolarEdge Technical Note - Fixed String Voltage, Concept of Operation]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this situation, if there is a string of panels in series and a single panel's output drops due to shade, its voltage will drop so that it can deliver the same amount of current (amps).  This would cause the string voltage to drop as well, except that the central inverter adjusts all the other optimizers so that their output voltage increases slightly, maintaining the fixed string voltage required at the inverter (just at reduced available amperage while the single panel is shaded).  The down side of this type of optimizer is that it requires a central inverter from the same manufacturer as the optimizers, so it is not possible to gradually retrofit these in an existing installation unless the inverter is also replaced, as well as optimizers installed on all panels at the same time.

== Major players ==
According to an IMS Research report from September 2012, [[Bmsolar|BMSolar]], [[Tigo Energy]], [[SolarEdge]] Technologies Inc. and [[Enphase Energy]] accounted for more than 90 percent of micro inverter and power optimizer shipments in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pvmarketresearch.com/press-release/Microinverters_Power_Optimizers_Outpace_PV_Inverters_in_2011_70_percent_Growth_Predicted_in_2012/4 ]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Greentech Media, another emerging player in the field of DC-DC optimizers for utility scale solar applications is Philadelphia-area based Alençon Systems LLC with its SPOT family of products.

'''Rare-earth magnets''' are strong [[permanent magnet]]s made from [[alloy]]s of [[rare-earth element]]s. Developed in the 1970s and 1980s, rare-earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets made, producing significantly stronger magnetic fields than other types such as [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] or [[alnico]] magnets. The [[magnetic field]] typically produced by rare-earth magnets can exceed 1.4 [[tesla (unit)|teslas]], whereas ferrite or ceramic magnets typically exhibit fields of 0.5 to 1 tesla.  There are two types: [[neodymium magnet]]s and [[samarium–cobalt magnet]]s. [[Magnetostriction|Magnetostrictive]] rare-earth magnets such as [[Terfenol-D]] also have applications, e.g. in [[loudspeaker]]s. Rare-earth magnets are extremely [[brittle]] and also vulnerable to [[corrosion]], so they are usually [[Plating|plated]] or [[coating|coated]] to protect them from breaking, chipping, or crumbling into powder.

The development of rare-earth magnets began around 1966, when  K. J. Strnat and G. Hoffer of the US Air Force Materials Laboratory discovered that an alloy of [[yttrium]] and [[cobalt]], YCo&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, had by far the largest [[magnetic anisotropy]] constant of any material then known.&lt;ref name="Cullity" &gt;{{cite book

[[File:Neodymium magnet lifting spheres.jpg|thumb|120px|Neodymium magnets (small cylinders) lifting steel balls. As shown here, rare-earth magnets can easily lift thousands of times their own weight.]]

==Explanation of strength==
The rare-earth ([[lanthanide]]) elements are metals that are [[ferromagnetic]], meaning that like [[iron]] they can be [[magnetization|magnetized]] to become [[permanent magnets]], but their [[Curie temperature]]s (the temperature above which their ferromagnetism disappears) are below room temperature, so in pure form their magnetism only appears at low temperatures.  However, they form compounds with the [[transition metal]]s such as [[iron]], [[nickel]], and [[cobalt]], and some of these compounds have Curie temperatures well above room temperature.  Rare-earth magnets are made from these compounds.

The greater strength of rare-earth magnets is mostly due to two factors.  First, their crystalline structures have very high [[magnetic anisotropy]]. This means that a crystal of the material preferentially magnetizes along a specific [[crystal axis]] but is very difficult to magnetize in other directions. Like other magnets, rare-earth magnets are composed of [[microcrystalline]] grains, which are aligned in a powerful magnetic field during manufacture, so their magnetic axes all point in the same direction.  The resistance of the crystal lattice to turning its direction of magnetization gives these compounds a very high [[magnetic coercivity]] (resistance to being demagnetized).

Second, atoms of rare-earth elements can have high [[magnetic moment]]s because their [[electron shell configuration|orbital electron structure]] contains many [[unpaired electron]]s, in contrast to other elements, in which almost all of the electrons exist in pairs with opposite spins, so their magnetic fields cancel out.  This is a consequence of incomplete filling of the [[f-shell]], which can contain up to 7 unpaired electrons.  In a magnet it is the unpaired electrons, aligned so they spin in the same direction, which generate the magnetic field.  This gives the materials high [[remanence]] ([[Magnetic saturation|saturation magnetization]] ''J''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;).  The maximal energy density ''BH''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is proportional to ''J''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so these materials have the potential for storing large amounts of magnetic energy.  The magnetic energy product ''BH''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of neodymium magnets is about 18 times greater than "ordinary" magnets by volume.  This allows rare-earth magnets to be smaller than other magnets with the same field strength.

==Magnetic properties==
Some important properties used to compare permanent magnets are: [[remanence]] (''B''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;), which measures the strength of the magnetic field; [[coercivity]] (''H''&lt;sub&gt;ci&lt;/sub&gt;), the material's resistance to becoming demagnetized; energy product (''BH''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;), the density of magnetic energy; and [[Curie temperature]] (''T''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;), the temperature at which the material loses its magnetism.  Rare-earth magnets have higher remanence, much higher coercivity and energy product, but (for neodymium) lower Curie temperature than other types.

== Types ==

=== Samarium-cobalt ===
{{main article|Samarium–cobalt magnet}}
[[Samarium–cobalt magnet]]s (chemical formula: [[samarium|Sm]][[cobalt|Co]]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), the first family of rare-earth magnets invented, are less used than neodymium magnets because of their higher cost and lower magnetic field strength.  However, samarium–cobalt has a higher [[Curie temperature]], creating a niche for these magnets in applications where high field strength is needed at high [[operating temperature]]s. They are highly resistant to oxidation, but sintered samarium-cobalt magnets are brittle and prone to chipping and cracking and may fracture when subjected to [[thermal shock]].

=== Neodymium ===
{{main article|Neodymium magnet}}
[[File:Neodymium magnet - 19-11-2010.JPG|right|thumb|Neodymium magnet with nickel plating mostly removed]]
[[Neodymium]] magnets, invented in the 1980s, are the strongest and most affordable type of rare-earth [[magnet]].  They are made of an alloy of [[neodymium]], [[iron]], and [[boron]] ([[Neodymium|Nd]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Iron|Fe]]&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;[[Boron|B]]), sometimes abbreviated as NIB.   Neodymium magnets are used in numerous applications requiring strong, compact permanent magnets, such as electric motors for [[Cordless|cordless tools]], [[hard disk drive]]s, magnetic holddowns, and jewelry clasps. They have the highest magnetic field strength and have a higher [[coercivity]] (which makes them magnetically stable), but they have a lower [[Curie temperature]] and are more vulnerable to [[oxidation]] than samarium–cobalt magnets.  [[Corrosion]] can cause unprotected magnets to [[spalling|spall]] off a surface layer or to crumble into a powder.  Use of protective surface treatments such as [[gold]], [[nickel]], [[zinc]], and [[tin]] plating and epoxy-resin coating can provide corrosion protection.

Originally, the high cost of these magnets limited their use to applications requiring compactness together with high field strength.  Both the raw materials and the patent licenses were expensive.  However, since the 1990s, [[Neodymium magnet|NIB magnets]] have become steadily less expensive, and the low cost has inspired new uses such as [[Neodymium magnet toys|magnetic construction toys]].

== Hazards ==
The greater force exerted by rare-earth magnets creates hazards that are not seen with other types of magnet.  Magnets larger than a few centimeters are strong enough to cause injuries to body parts pinched between two magnets or a magnet and a metal surface, even causing broken bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There have even been cases where young children who have swallowed several magnets have had a fold of the [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]] pinched between the magnets, causing injury and in one case intestinal perforations, [[sepsis]] and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Magnet Safety Alert |url=http://www.cpsc.gov/PageFiles/112864/5221.pdf |work= |publisher=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission |accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]] passed a rule restricting rare-earth magnet size in consumer products, but it was vacated by a US Federal court decision in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Alston &amp; Bird |title=CPSC Recall Snapshot |date=December 2016 |url=http://www.alston.com/Files/Publication/68cd9b0e-44e0-46d7-bcd8-69d930f70bfa/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/e8b8400f-13b8-479e-b103-6e2e7cb4f31d/CPSCRecallSnapshotDecember2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Since their prices became competitive in the 1990s, neodymium magnets have been replacing [[Alnico]] and [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] magnets in the many applications in modern technology requiring powerful magnets.  Their greater strength allows smaller and lighter magnets to be used for a given application.

=== Common applications ===

==Rare-earth-free permanent magnets==
The [[United States Department of Energy]] has identified a need to find substitutes for rare-earth metals in permanent-magnet technology and has begun funding such research. The [[Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy]] (ARPA-E) has sponsored a Rare Earth Alternatives in Critical Technologies (REACT) program, to develop alternative materials. In 2011, ARPA-E awarded 31.6 million dollars to fund Rare-Earth Substitute projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research Funding for Rare Earth Free Permanent Magnets |url=http://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/react |work= |publisher= ARPA-E |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3851">The '''Reduced-Moderation Water Reactor''' ('''RMWR'''), also referred to as the '''Resource-renewable BWR''', is a proposed type of [[light water reactor|light water]] moderated [[nuclear power reactor]], featuring some characteristics of a [[fast neutron reactor]], thereby combining the established and proven technology of light water reactors with the desired features of fast neutron reactors. The RMWR concept builds upon the [[Advanced Boiling Water Reactor]] and is under active development in theoretical studies, particularly in [[Japan]]. [[Hitachi]] and the [[Japan Atomic Energy Agency]] are both involved in research.

Even in [[Generation II reactor|Generation II]] [[pressurized water reactor|PWR]]s, the neutron spectrum is not fully thermalised. The goal of the RMWR is to depart further from the thermal neutron spectrum in order to achieve a [[breeder ratio]] of slightly greater than one, so that after the initial fuel charge no enrichment of the uranium input to the fuel cycle is required. The RMWR concept is dependent on [[nuclear fuel reprocessing]] in order to achieve its objective of a resource renewable fuel cycle. Hitachi has proposed the FLUOREX process as reprocessing technology for this purpose, instead of the more conventional [[Purex]] technology. 

In contrast to regular light water reactors and in order to achieve a harder neutron spectrum, which is optimal for breeding purposes, the RMWR uses hexagonal fuel assemblies and Y-shaped control rods. The fuel is [[MOX]] (Mixed Oxide), consisting of 18% [[plutonium]], which is surrounded by [[depleted uranium]] in the blanket region. 

The RMWR has an electric output of 1356 MW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, or 3926 MW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;.

Another RMWR breeder design intends on closing the nuclear fuel cycle by mixing [[thorium]] with reprocessed [[transuranium|transuranics]], which include plutonium, in a thorium containing MOX fuel. The neutron speed would be in the [[epithermal neutron|spectrum]] that could purportedly [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutate]] the long-lived [[fission products]] like [[Tc-99]] &amp; [[isotopes of iodine|I-127]] and as the neutron spectrum is hard/fast enough, to also be capable of burning the usually troublesome [[minor actinide]]s quite efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-weinberg-foundation.org/2013/04/05/how-thorium-can-solve-the-nuclear-waste-problem-in-conventional-reactors/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/news/stories/2012/safer_nuclear_future/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guanheng_Zhang/publication/283084524_Comparison_of_Reduced-moderation_Boiling_Water_Reactor_and_Sodium-cooled_Fast_Reactor_Technologies/links/5728b41808ae057b0a03306b/Comparison-of-Reduced-moderation-Boiling-Water-Reactor-and-Sodium-cooled-Fast-Reactor-Technologies.pdf?origin=publication_detail&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitachi announced a collaboration with three U.S. universities on the development of the RBWR/RMWR in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/WR-Hitachi-collaborates-on-TRU-consuming-reactor-development-2908144.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hitachi.com/rev/pdf/2014/r2014_09_103.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''separator''' in oilfield terminology designates a [[pressure vessel]] used for separating well [[fluid]]s produced from oil and [[gas well]]s into gaseous and [[liquid]] components. A separator for petroleum production is a large vessel designed to separate [[production fluid]]s into their constituent components of [[crude oil|oil]], [[natural gas|gas]] and [[water]]. A separating vessel may be referred to in the following ways: '''Oil and gas separator''', '''Separator''', '''Stage separator''', '''Trap''', '''Knockout vessel''' (Knockout drum, knockout trap, water knockout, or liquid knockout), '''Flash chamber''' (flash vessel or flash trap), '''Expansion separator''' or '''expansion vessel''', '''Scrubber''' (gas scrubber), '''Filter''' (gas filter). These separating vessels are normally used on a producing lease or platform near the wellhead, manifold, or tank battery to separate [[fluid]]s produced from oil and gas wells into oil and gas or liquid and gas. An oil and gas separator generally includes the following essential components and features:

1. A vessel that includes (a) primary separation device and/or section, (b) secondary [[settling|“gravity” settling]] (separating) section, (c) mist extractor to remove small liquid particles from the gas, (d) gas outlet, (e) liquid settling (separating) section to remove gas or vapor from oil (on a three-phase unit, this section also separates water from oil), (f) oil outlet, and (g) water outlet (three-phase unit).

2. Adequate [[volume]]tric liquid capacity to handle liquid surges (slugs) from the wells and/or flowlines.

3. Adequate vessel diameter and height or length to allow most of the liquid to separate from the gas so that the mist extractor will not be flooded.

4. A means of controlling an oil level in the separator, which usually includes a liquid-level controller and a diaphragm motor [[valve]] on the oil outlet.

5. A back pressure valve on the gas outlet to maintain a steady [[pressure]] in the vessel.

6. Pressure relief devices.

Separators work on the principle that the three components have different [[density|densities]], which allows them to stratify when moving slowly with [[natural gas|gas]] on top, [[water]] on the bottom and [[crude oil|oil]] in the middle.  Any solids such as sand will also settle in the bottom of the separator. The functions of [[crude oil|oil]] and [[gas]] separators can be divided into the primary and secondary functions which will be discussed later on.

==Classification of oil and gas separators==

===Classification by operating configuration===
Oil and [[gas]] separators can have three general configurations: '''vertical''', '''horizontal''', and '''spherical'''.
Vertical separators can vary in size from 10 or 12 inches in [[diameter]] and 4 to 5&amp;nbsp;feet seam to seam (S to S) up to 10 or 12&amp;nbsp;feet in diameter and 15 to 25&amp;nbsp;feet S to S. Horizontal separators may vary in size from 10 or 12 inches in [[diameter]] and 4 to 5&amp;nbsp;feet S to S up to 15 to 16&amp;nbsp;feet in diameter and 60 to 70&amp;nbsp;feet S to S. Spherical separators are usually available in 24 or 30 inch up to 66 to 72 inch in diameter.
Horizontal oil and [[gas]] separators are manufactured with monotube and dual-tube shells. Monotube units have one [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] shell, and dual-tube units have two cylindrical parallel shells with one above the other. Both types of units can be used for two-phase and three-phase service. A monotube horizontal oil and gas separator is usually preferred over a dual-tube unit. The monotube unit has greater area for gas flow as well as a greater oil/gas interface area than is usually available in a dual-tube separator of comparable price. The monotube separator will usually afford a longer retention time because the larger single-tube vessel retains a larger [[volume]] of oil than the dual-tube separator. It is also easier to clean than the dualtube unit.
In cold climates, freezing will likely cause less trouble in the monotube unit because the [[liquid]] is usually in close contact with the warm stream of gas flowing through the separator. The monotube design normally has a lower silhouette than the dual-tube unit, and it is easier to stack them for multiple-stage separation on offshore platforms where space is limited. It was illustrated by Powers ''et al'' (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Maston L., 1990. Analysis of Gravity Separation in Freewater Knockouts. ''SPE Production Engineering'', [e-journal]5(1). Available through OnePetro database [Accessed 5 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; that vertical separators should be constructed such that the flow stream enters near the top and passes through a gas/liquid separating chamber even though they are not competitive alternatives unlike the horizontal separators.

===Classification by function===
The three configurations of separators are available for two-phase operation and three-phase operation. In the two-phase units, [[gas]] is separated from the [[liquid]] with the gas and liquid being discharged separately. Oil and gas separators are mechanically designed such that the liquid and gas components are separated from the hydrocarbon steam at specific temperature and pressure according to Arnold ''et al'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Steward, 2008. Surface Production Operations. Design of Oil handling Sysytems and Facilities. Oxford: Gulf Professional Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In three-phase separators, well [[fluid]] is separated into gas, oil, and [[water]] with the three fluids being discharged separately. The gas-liquid separation section of the separator is determined by the maximum removal droplet size using the [[Souders–Brown equation]] with an appropriate K factor. The oil-water separation section is held for a retention time that is provided by laboratory test data, pilot plant operating procedure, or operating experience. In the case where the retention time is not available, the recommended retention time for three-phase separator in API 12J is used. The sizing methods by K factor and retention time give proper separator sizes. According to Song ''et al'' (2010),&lt;ref&gt;Joon H. Song, B. E. Jeong, H.J. Kim, S. S. Gil, 2010. Three-Phases Separator Sizing Using Drop Size Distribution. ''In: Offshore Technology Conference, 3–6 May 2010.'' Houston: Dawoo Shipbuilding &amp; Marine Engineering Co., LTD..&lt;/ref&gt; engineers sometimes need further information for the design conditions of downstream equipment, i.e., liquid loading for the mist extractor, water content for the crude dehydrator/desalter or oil content for the water treatment.

===Classification by operating pressure===
Oil and [[gas]] separators can operate at pressures ranging from a high vacuum to 4,000 to 5,000 psi. Most oil and gas separators operate in the [[pressure]] range of 20 to 1,500 psi.Separators may be referred to as low pressure, medium pressure, or high pressure. Low-pressure separators
usually operate at pressures ranging from 10 to 20 up to 180 to 225 psi. Medium-pressure separators usually operate at pressures ranging from 230 to 250 up to 600 to 700 psi. High-pressure separators generally operate in the wide pressure range from 750 to 1,500 psi.

===Classification by application===
Oil and [[gas]] separators may be classified according to application as test separator, production separator, low [[temperature]] separator, metering separator, elevated separator, and stage separators (first stage, second stage, etc.).

*'''Test separator:'''

A [[test separator]] is used to separate and to meter the well [[fluid]]s. The test separator can be referred to as a well tester or well checker. Test separators can be vertical, horizontal, or spherical. They can be two-phase or three-phase. They can be permanently installed or portable (skid or trailer mounted). Test separators can be equipped with various types of meters for measuring the oil, [[gas]], and/or [[water]] for potential tests, periodic production tests, marginal well tests, etc.

*'''Production separator:'''

A production separator is used to separate the produced well [[fluid]] from a well, group of wells, or a lease on a daily or continuous basis. Production separators can be vertical, horizontal, or spherical. They can be two-phase or three-phase. Production separators range in size from 12 in. to 15&amp;nbsp;ft in [[diameter]], with most units ranging from 30 in. to 10&amp;nbsp;ft in diameter. They range in length from 6 to 70&amp;nbsp;ft, with most from 10 to 40&amp;nbsp;ft long.

*'''Low-temperature separator:'''

A low-temperature separator is a special one in which high-pressure well [[fluid]] is jetted into the vessel through a choke or pressure reducing [[valve]] so that the separator [[temperature]] is reduced appreciably below the well-fluid temperature. The temperature reduction is obtained by the [[Joule–Thomson effect]] of expanding well fluid as it flows through the pressure-reducing choke or valve into the separator. The lower [[operating temperature]] in the separator causes condensation of vapors that otherwise would exit the separator in the vapor state. Liquids thus recovered require stabilization to prevent excessive evaporation in the storage tanks.

*'''Metering separator:'''

The function of separating well [[fluid]]s into oil, [[gas]], and [[water]] and metering the liquids can be accomplished in one vessel. These vessels are commonly referred to as metering separators and are available for two-phase and three-phase operation. These units are available in special models that make them suitable for accurately metering foaming and heavy viscous oil.

==Primary functions of oil and gas separators==

Separation of [[crude oil|oil]] from [[gas]] may begin as the [[fluid]] flows through the producing formation into the well bore and may progressively increase through the tubing, flow lines, and surface handling equipment. Under certain conditions, the fluid may be completely separated into [[liquid]] and gas before it reaches the oil and gas separator. In such cases, the separator vessel affords only an "enlargement" to permit gas to ascend to one outlet and liquid to descend to another.

===Removal of oil from gas===

Difference in density of the [[liquid]] and gaseous [[hydrocarbon]]s may accomplish acceptable separation in an [[crude oil|oil]] and [[gas]] separator. However, in some instances, it is necessary to use mechanical devices commonly referred to as "mist extractors" to remove liquid mist from the gas before
it is discharged from the separator. Also, it may be desirable or necessary to use some means to remove non solution gas from the oil before the oil is discharged from the separator.

===Removal of gas from oil===

The physical and chemical characteristics of the [[crude oil|oil]] and its conditions of [[pressure]] and [[temperature]] determine the amount of [[gas]] it will contain in solution. The rate at which the [[gas]] is liberated from a given oil is a function of change in pressure and temperature. The [[volume]] of gas that an oil and gas separator will remove from crude oil is dependent on (1) physical and chemical characteristics of the crude, (2) operating pressure, (3) operating temperature, (4) rate of throughput, (5) size and configuration of the separator, and (6) other factors.

Agitation, heat, special baffling, coalescing packs, and filtering materials can assist in the removal of nonsolution [[gas]] that otherwise may be retained in the [[crude oil|oil]] because of the viscosity and surface tension of the oil. [[Natural gas|Gas]] can be removed from the top of the drum by virtue of being gas.  Oil and [[water]] are separated by a [[baffle (in vessel)|baffle]] at the end of the separator, which is set at a height close to the oil-water contact, allowing oil to spill over onto the other side, while trapping water on the near side.  The two [[fluid]]s can then be piped out of the separator from their respective sides of the baffle.  The produced water is then either injected back into the oil reservoir, disposed of, or treated.  The bulk level (gas–liquid interface) and the oil water interface are determined using instrumentation fixed to the vessel.  [[Valve]]s on the oil and water outlets are controlled to ensure the interfaces are kept at their optimum levels for separation to occur. The separator will only achieve bulk separation. The smaller droplets of water will not settle by gravity and will remain in the oil stream. Normally the oil from the separator is routed to a [[coalescer]] to further reduce the water content.

===Separation of water from oil===

The production of [[water]] with oil continues to be a problem for engineers and the oil producers. Since 1865 when water was coproduced with hydrocarbons, separation of valuable hydrocarbons from disposable water has challenged and frustrated the oil industry. According to Rehm ''et al'' (1983),&lt;ref&gt;Rehm, S.J., Shaughnessy, R.J., III, C-E Natco, 1983. Enhanced Oil-Water Separation-The Performax Coalescer. ''In: SPE Production Operations Symposium.''  Oklahoma City, Oklahoma  27 February – 1 March 1983. Oklahoma City: Society of Petroleum Engineers of AIME.&lt;/ref&gt; innovation over the years has led from the skim pit to installation of the stock tank, to the gunbarrel, to the freewater knockout, to the hay-packed [[coalescer]] and most recently to the Performax Matrix Plate Coalescer, an enhanced gravity settling separator. The history of water treating for the most part has been sketchy and spartan. There is little economic value to the produced water, and it represents an extra cost for the producer to arrange for its disposal. Today oil fields produce greater quantities of water than they produce oil. Along with greater water production are emulsions and dispersions which are more difficult to treat. The separation process becomes interlocked with a myriad of contaminants as the last drop of oil is being recovered from the reservoir. In some instances it is preferable to separate and to remove [[water]] from the well [[fluid]] before it flows through [[pressure]] reductions, such as those caused by chokes and [[valve]]s. Such water removal may prevent difficulties that could be caused [[Downstream (petroleum industry)|downstream]] by the water, such as [[corrosion]] which can be referred to as being a chemical reactions that occurs whenever a gas or liquid chemically attacks an exposed metallic surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/138721/corrosion |title=Corrosion on Encyclopædia Britannica 2011 – Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Accessed: 04 April 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrosion is usually accelerated by warm temperatures and likewise by the presence of acids and salts. Other factors that affect the removal of water from oil include hydrate formation and the formation of tight emulsion that may be difficult to resolve into [[crude oil|oil]] and water. The water can be separated from the oil in a three-phase separator by use of chemicals and gravity separation. If the three-phase separator is not large enough to separate
the water adequately, it can be separated in a free-water knockout vessel installed [[Upstream (petroleum industry)|upstream]] or downstream of the separators.

==Secondary functions of oil and gas separators==

===Maintenance of optimum pressure on separator===

For an [[crude oil|oil]] and [[gas]] separator to accomplish its primary functions, [[pressure]] must be maintained in the separator so that the [[liquid]] and gas can be discharged into their respective processing or gathering systems. Pressure is maintained on the separator by use of a gas backpressure [[valve]] on each separator or with one master backpressure valve that controls the pressure on a battery of two or more separators. The optimum pressure to maintain on a separator is the pressure that will result in the highest economic yield from the sale of the liquid and gaseous [[hydrocarbon]]s.

===Maintenance of liquid seal in separator===

To maintain [[pressure]] on a separator, a [[liquid]] seal must be effected in the lower portion of the vessel. This liquid seal prevents loss of [[gas]] with the oil and requires the use of a liquid-level controller and a [[valve]].

==Methods used to remove oil from gas in separators==

Effective oil-gas separation is important not only to ensure that the required export quality is achieved but also to prevent problems in downstream process equipment and compressors. Once the bulk liquid has been knocked out, which can be achieved in many ways, the remaining liquid droplets are separated from by a demisting device. Until recently the main technologies used for this application were reverse-flow cyclones, mesh pads and vane packs. More recently new devices with higher gas-handling have been developed which have enabled potential reduction in the scrubber vessel size. There are several new concepts currently under development in which the fluids are degassed upstream of the primary separator. These systems are based on centrifugal and turbine technology and have additional advantages in that they are compact and motion insensitive, hence ideal for [[Floating production storage and offloading|floating production facilities]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, A.C., Chamberlain, N.P., Irshad, M., 1998. A New Approach to Gas–Liquid Separation. ''In: European Petroleum Conference.'' The Hague, Netherlands  20–22 October 1998. The Hague: Kvaerner Paladon Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some of the ways in which oil is separated from gas in separators.

===Density difference (gravity separation)===
Natural gas is lighter than [[liquid]] [[hydrocarbon]]. Minute particles of liquid hydrocarbon that are temporarily suspended in a stream of natural gas will, by density difference or force of gravity, settle out of the stream of [[gas]] if the velocity of the gas is sufficiently slow. The larger droplets of hydrocarbon will quickly settle out of the gas, but the smaller ones will take longer. At standard conditions of [[pressure]] and [[temperature]], the droplets of liquid hydrocarbon may have a density 400 to 1,600 times that of natural gas. However, as the operating pressure and temperature increase, the difference in density decreases. At an operating pressure of 800 psig, the liquid hydrocarbon may be only 6 to 10 times as dense as the gas. Thus, operating pressure materially affects the size of the separator and the size and type of mist extractor required to separate adequately the liquid and gas. The fact that the liquid droplets may have a density 6 to 10 times that of the gas may indicate that droplets of liquid would quickly settle out of and separate from the gas. However, this may not occur because the particles of liquid may be so small that they tend to "float" in the gas and may not settle out of the gas stream in the short period of time the gas is in the oil and gas separator. As the operating pressure on a separator increases, the density difference between the liquid and gas decreases. For this reason, it is desirable to operate oil and gas separators at as low a pressure as is consistent with other process variables, conditions, and requirements.

===Impingement===
If a flowing stream of [[gas]] containing [[liquid]], mist is impinged against a surface, the liquid mist may adhere to and coalesce on the surface. After the mist coalesces into larger droplets, the droplets will gravitate to the liquid section of the vessel. If the liquid content of the gas is high, or if the mist particles are extremely fine, several successive [[impingement filter|impingement surfaces]] may be required to effect satisfactory removal of the mist.

===Change of flow direction===
When the direction of flow of a [[gas]] stream containing [[liquid]] mist is changed abruptly, inertia causes the liquid to continue in the original direction of flow. Separation of liquid mist from the gas thus can be effected because the gas will more readily assume the change of flow direction and will flow away from the liquid mist particles. The liquid thus removed may coalesce on a surface or fall to the liquid section below.

===Change of flow velocity===
Separation of [[liquid]] and [[gas]] can be effected with either a sudden increase or decrease in gas velocity. Both conditions use the difference in inertia of gas and liquid. With a decrease in velocity, the higher inertia of the liquid mist carries it forward and away from the gas.&lt;ref&gt;changent, 2008. ''Production Separator Principles – sample''[video online] Available at:&lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhkcGCUN_Uo&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PLD23100F9395C2BB0&gt; [Accessed 10 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The liquid may then coalesce on some surface and gravitate to the liquid section of the separator. With an increase in gas velocity, the higher inertia of the liquid causes the gas to move away from the liquid, and the liquid may fall to the liquid section of the vessel.

===Centrifugal force===
If a [[gas]] stream carrying [[liquid]] mist flows in a circular motion at sufficiently high velocity, centrifugal force throws the liquid mist outward against the walls of the container. Here the liquid coalesces into progressively larger droplets and finally gravitates to the liquid section below. Centrifugal force is one of the most effective methods of separating liquid mist from gas. However, according to Keplinger (1931),&lt;ref&gt;Keplinger, 1931. Physical Problems in the Separation of Oil and Gas. ''Proceedings of the Oklahoma, University of Tulsa'', Volume VI, pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt; some separator designers have pointed out a disadvantage in that a liquid with a free surface rotating as a whole will have its surface curved around its lowest point lying on the axis of rotation. This created false level may cause difficulty in regulating the fluid level control on the separator. This is largely overcome by placing vertical quieting baffles which should extend from the bottom of the separator to above the outlet. Efficiency of this type of mist extractor increases as the velocity of the gas stream increases. Thus for a given rate of throughput, a smaller centrifugal separator will suffice.

==Methods used to remove gas from oil in separators==
Because of higher prices for natural [[gas]], the widespread reliance on metering of [[liquid]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, and other reasons, it is important to remove all nonsolution gas from crude oil during field processing. Methods used to remove gas from crude oil in oil and gas separators are discussed below:

===Agitation===
Moderate, controlled agitation which can be defined as movement of the crude oil with sudden force&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/agitate |title=Agitation on The Free Dictionary by Farlex 2011. Accessed: 10 April 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is usually helpful in removing nonsolution [[gas]] that may be mechanically locked in the oil by surface tension and oil viscosity. Agitation usually will cause the gas bubbles to coalesce and to separate from the oil in less time than would be required if agitation were not used.

===Heat===
Heat as a form of energy that is transferred from one body to another results in a difference in temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/258569/heat |title=Heat on Encyclopædia Britannica 2011 – Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Accessed: 04 April 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduces surface tension and viscosity of the oil and thus assists in releasing [[gas]] that is hydraulically retained in the oil. The most effective method of heating crude oil is to pass it through a heated-water bath. A spreader plate that disperses the oil into small streams or rivulets increases the effectiveness of the heated-water bath. Upward flow of the oil through the [[water]] bath affords slight agitation, which is helpful in coalescing and separating entrained gas from the oil. A heated-water bath is probably the most effective method of removing foam bubbles from foaming crude oil. A heated-water bath is not practical in most oil and gas separators, but heat can be added to the oil by direct or indirect fired heaters and/or heat exchangers, or heated free-water knockouts or emulsion treaters can be used to obtain a heated-water bath.

===Centrifugal force===
Centrifugal force which can be defined as a fictitious force, peculiar to a particle moving on a circular path, that has the same magnitude and dimensions as the force that keeps the particle on its circular path (the [[centripetal force]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/102839/centrifugal-force |title=Centrifugal Force on Encyclopædia Britannica 2011 – Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Accessed: 04 April 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but points in the opposite direction is effective in separating [[gas]] from oil. The heavier oil is thrown outward against the wall of the vortex retainer while the gas occupies the inner portion of the vortex. A properly shaped and sized vortex will allow the gas to ascend while the [[liquid]] flows downward
to the bottom of the unit.

==Flow measurements in oil and gas separators==
The direction of flow in and around a separator along with other flow instruments are usually illustrated on the [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]], (P&amp;ID). Some of these flow instruments include the Flow Indicator (FI), Flow Transmitter (FT) and the Flow Controller (FC). Flow is of paramount importance in the oil and gas industry because flow, as a major process variable is essentially important in that its understanding helps engineers come up with better designs and enables them to confidently carry out additional research. Mohan ''et al'' (1999) &lt;ref&gt;Ram S. Mohan, Ovadia  Shoham, 1999. Design  and  Development  of  Gas-Liquid Cylindrical  Cyclone
Compact  Separators  for  Three-Phase  Flow. ''In: Oil and Gas Conference – Technology Options for Producers' Survival,'' Dallas, Texas 28–30 June 1999. Dallas: DOE and PTTC&lt;/ref&gt;  carried out a research into the design and development of separators for a three-phase flow system. The purpose of the study was to investigate the complex multiphase [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamic]] flow behaviour in a three-phase oil and gas separator. A mechanistic model was developed alongside a [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) simulator. These were then used to carry out a detailed experimentation on the three-phase separator.  The experimental and CFD simulation results were suitably integrated with the mechanistic model. The simulation time for the experiment was 20 seconds with the oil specific gravity as 0.885, and the separator lower part length and diameter were 4-ft and 3-inches respectively. The first set of experiment became a basis through which detailed investigations were used to carry out and to conduct similar simulation studies for different flow velocities and other operating conditions as well.

==Flow calibration in oil and gas separators==
As earlier stated, flow instruments that function with the separator in an oil and gas environment include the flow indicator, flow transmitter and the flow controller. Due to maintenance (which will be discussed later) or due to high usage, these flowmeters do need to be calibrated from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/89464/calibration |title=Calibration on Encyclopædia Britannica 2011 – Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Accessed: 04 April 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calibration can be defined as the process of referencing signals of known quantity that has been predetermined to suit the range of measurements required. Calibration can also be seen from a mathematical point of view in which the flowmeters are standardized by determining the deviation from the predetermined standard so as to ascertain the proper correction factors. In determining the deviation from the predetermined standard, the actual flowrate is usually first determined with '''the use of a master meter''' which is a type of flowmeter that has been calibrated with a high degree of accuracy or '''by weighing the flow so as to be able to obtain a gravimetric reading of the mass flow'''. Another type of meter used is the '''transfer meter'''. However, according to Ting ''et al'' (1989),&lt;ref&gt;Ting, V.C., Halpine, J.C., 1989. Portable Piston Gas Prover for Field Calibration of Flowmeters. ''SPE Production Engineering'', 6(4), pp. 454–458.&lt;/ref&gt; transfer meters have been proven to be less accurate if the operating conditions are different from its original calibrated points. According to Yoder (2000),&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Yoder, 2000. Flowmeter Calibration: How, Why, and Where. Control for the Process Industries. Houston:  Putman Media.&lt;/ref&gt; the types of flowmeters used as '''master meters''' include turbine meters, positive displacement meters, venturi meters, and Coriolis meters. In the U.S., master meters are often calibrated at a flow lab that has been certified by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], (NIST). NIST certification of a flowmeter lab means that its methods have been approved by NIST. Normally, this includes NIST traceability, meaning that the standards used in the flowmeter [[calibration]] process have been certified by NIST or are causally linked back to standards that have been approved by NIST. However, there is a general belief in the industry that the second method which involves the gravimetric weighing of the amount of fluid (liquid or gas) that actually flows through the meter into or out of a container during the calibration procedure is the most ideal method for measuring the actual amount of flow. Apparently, the weighing scale used for this method also has to be traceable to the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) as well.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Yoder, 2000. Flowmeter Calibration: How, Why, and Where. Control for the Process Industries. Houston:  Putman Media.&lt;/ref&gt;
In ascertaining a proper correction factor, there is often no simple hardware adjustment to make the flowmeter start reading correctly. Instead, the deviation from the correct reading is recorded at a variety of flowrates. The data points are plotted, comparing the flowmeter output to the actual flowrate as determined by the standardized National Institute of Standards and Technology master meter or weigh scale.

==Controls, valves, accessories, and safety features for oil and gas separators==

===Controls===

The controls required for oil and [[gas]] separators are [[liquid]] level controllers for oil and oil/water interface (three-phase operation) and gas back-pressure control [[valve]] with pressure controller. Although the use of controls is expensive making the cost of operating fields with separators so high, installations has resulted in substantial savings in the overall operating expense as in the case of the 70 gas wells in the Big Piney, Wyo sighted by Fair (1968).&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Fair, 1968. Gas-field Telemetering and Remote Control, Big Piney, Wyoming. Drilling and Production Practice, 1968. Houston:  American Petroleum Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; The wells with separators were located above 7,200&amp;nbsp;ft elevation, ranging upward to 9,000&amp;nbsp;ft. Control installations were sufficiently automated such that the field operations around the controllers could be operated from a remote-control station at the field office using the [[Distributed Control System]]. All in all, this improved the efficiency of personnel and the operation of the field, with a corresponding increase in production from the area.

===Valves===

The [[valve]]s required for oil and [[gas]] separators are oil discharge control valve, water-discharge control valve (three-phase operation), drain valves, block valves, pressure relief valves, and [[Shut down valve|Emergency Shutdown valves]] (ESD). ESD valves typically stay in open position for months or years awaiting a command signal to operate. Little attention is paid to these valves outside of scheduled turnarounds. The pressures of continuous production often stretch these intervals even longer. This leads to build up or corrosion on these valves that prevents them from moving. For safety critical applications, it must be ensured that the valves operate upon demand.&lt;ref&gt;Sadoun Mutar Bezea Al-Khaledi, Naser Abdulaziz, Dwaipayan Bora, 2011. Replacement of Existing ESD Valves with New SIL Rated ESD Valves: A Case Study of Production Optimization and Enhancement of Process Safety and Integrity in Kuwait Oil Company. ''In: SPE Project and Facilities Challenges Conference'' Doha, Qatar 13–16 February 2011. Doha:  Kuwait Oil Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accessories===

The accessories required for oil and [[gas]] separators are pressure gauges, [[thermometers]], pressure-reducing regulators (for control gas), level sight glasses, safety head with rupture disk, [[piping]], and tubing.

===Safety features for oil and gas separators===

Oil and [[gas]] separators should be installed at a safe distance from other lease equipment. Where they are installed on offshore platforms or in close proximity to other equipment, precautions should be taken to prevent injury to personnel and damage to surrounding equipment in case the
separator or its controls or accessories fail. The following safety features are recommended for most oil and gas separators.

*'''High- and low-liquid-level controls:'''

High- and low liquid-level controls normally are float-operated pilots that actuate a [[valve]] on the inlet to the separator, open a bypass around the separator, sound a warning alarm, or perform some other pertinent function to prevent damage that might result from high or low [[liquid]] levels in the separator.

*'''High- and low-pressure controls:'''

High- and low pressure controls are installed on separators to prevent excessively high or low pressures from interfering with normal operations. These high- and low-pressure controls can be mechanical, pneumatic, or electric and can sound a warning, actuate a shut-in [[valve]], open a bypass, or perform other pertinent functions to protect personnel, the separator, and surrounding equipment.

*'''High- and low-temperature controls:'''

[[Temperature]] controls may be installed on separators to shut in the unit, to open or to close a bypass to a heater, or to sound a warning should the temperature in the separator become too high or too low. Such temperature controls are not normally used on separators, but they may be appropriate in special cases. According to Francis (1951), low-temperature controls in separators is another tools used by gas producers which finds its application in the high-pressure gas fields, usually referred to as "vapour-phase" reservoirs. Low temperatures obtainable from the expansion of these high-pressure gas streams are utilized to a profitable advantage. A more efficient recovery of the hydrocarbon condensate and a greater degree of dehydration of the gas as compared to the conventional heater and separator installation is a major advantage of low-temperature controls in oil and gas separators.&lt;ref&gt;A. W. Francis, 1951. Low-Temperature Separation as Applied to Gas-Condensate Production. Drilling and Production Practice, 1951. Houston:  American Petroleum Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Safety relief valves:'''

A spring-loaded safety relief [[valve]] is usually installed on all oil and [[gas]] separators. These valves normally are set at the design pressure of the vessel. Safety relief valves serve primarily as a warning, and in most instances are too small to handle the full rated [[fluid]] capacity of the separator. Full-capacity safety relief valves can be used and are particularly recommended when no safety head (rupture disk) is used on the separator.

*'''Safety heads or rupture disks:'''

A safety head or rupture disk is a device containing a thin metal membrane that is designed to rupture when the [[pressure]] in the separator exceeds a predetermined value. This is usually from 1 1/4 to 1% times the design pressure of the separator vessel. The safety head disk is usually selected so that it will not rupture until the safety relief [[valve]] has opened and is incapable of preventing excessive pressure buildup in the separator.

==Operation and maintenance considerations for oil and gas separators==

Over the life of a production system, the separator is expected to process a wide range of produced fluids. With break through from water flood and expanded gas lift circulation, the produced fluid water cut and gas-oil ratio is ever changing. In many instances, the separator fluid loading may exceed the original design capacity of the vessel. As a result, many operators find their separator no longer able to meet the required oil and water effluent standards, or experience high liquid carry-over in the gas according to Power ''et al'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Choi, M.S., 1990. Prediction of Separator Performance Under Changing Field Conditions. ''In: SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition,'' New Orleans, Louisiana 23–26 September 1990. New Orleans: Conoco Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Some operational maintenance and considerations are discussed below:

===Periodic inspection===

In refineries and processing plants, it is normal practice to inspect all [[pressure]] vessels and piping periodically for [[corrosion]] and erosion. In the oil fields, this practice is not generally followed (they are inspected at a predetermined frequency, normally decided by an RBI assessment) and equipment is replaced only after actual failure. This policy may create hazardous conditions for operating personnel and surrounding equipment. It is recommended that periodic inspection schedules for all pressure equipment be established and followed to protect against undue failures.

===Installation of safety devices===

All safety relief devices should be installed as close to the vessel as possible and in such manner that the reaction force from exhausting [[fluid]]s will not break off, unscrew, or otherwise dislodge the safety device. The discharge from safety devices should not endanger personnel
or other equipment.

===Low temperature===

Separators should be operated above hydrate-formation [[temperature]]. Otherwise hydrates may form in the vessel and partially or completely plug it thereby reducing the capacity of the separator. In some instances when the [[liquid]] or [[gas]] outlet is plugged or restricted, this causes the safety [[valve]] to open or the safety head to rupture. Steam coils can be installed in the liquid section of oil and gas separators to melt hydrates that may form there. This is especially appropriate on low-temperature separators.

===Corrosive fluids===

A separator handling corrosive [[fluid]] should be checked periodically to determine whether remedial work is required. Extreme cases of [[corrosion]] may require a reduction in the rated working [[pressure]] of the vessel. Periodic hydrostatic testing is recommended, especially if the fluids being handled are corrosive. Expendable [[anode]] can be used in separators to protect them against [[Electrolyte|electrolytic]] [[corrosion]]. Some operators determine separator shell and head thickness with ultrasonic thickness indicators and calculate the maximum allowable working pressure from the remaining metal thickness. This should be done yearly offshore and every two to four years onshore.

[[File:Peacock feathers closeup.jpg|thumb|250px| The brilliant iridescent colours of the peacock's tail feathers are created by structural coloration, as first noted by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Robert Hooke]].]]
'''Structural coloration'''&lt;!--"Coloration" is a standard British English spelling, as in [[Hugh Cott]]'s 1940 ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]'', and is also used in American English. It follows a little-known rule, that roots in ''-our'' when given Latinate suffixes should use the ''-or'' spelling accordingly, as if borrowed directly from Latin instead of through French: ''colouring'' and ''colourist'' but ''coloration'', ''colorimetry'', and ''colorize''; ''honourable'' but ''honorarium''; ''humourless'' but ''humorous''; and so on. So this apparent aberration is actually a kind of etymological spelling, although the American usage may have been an influence post-Webster. (See Fowler's [[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|''MEU'']] sv '''-our- and -or-'''.)--&gt; is the production of colour by microscopically structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with [[visible light]], sometimes in combination with [[pigment]]s. For example, [[peacock]] tail [[feather]]s are pigmented brown, but their microscopic structure makes them also reflect blue, turquoise, and green light, and they are often [[iridescence|iridescent]].

Structural coloration was first observed by English scientists Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton, and its principle – [[wave interference]] – explained by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] a century later. Young described iridescence as the result of interference between reflections from two or more surfaces of [[thin films]], combined with refraction as light enters and leaves such films. The geometry then determines that at certain angles, the light reflected from both surfaces interferes constructively, while at other angles, the light interferes destructively. Different colours therefore appear at different angles.

[[Animal coloration|In animals]] such as on the feathers of birds and the scales of [[butterfly|butterflies]], interference is created by a range of [[photonic]] mechanisms, including [[diffraction grating]]s, selective mirrors, [[photonic crystals]], crystal fibres, matrices of nanochannels and proteins that can vary their configuration. Some [[cuts of meat]] also show structural coloration due to the exposure of the periodic arrangement of the muscular fibres. Many of these photonic mechanisms correspond to elaborate structures visible by [[electron microscopy]]. In the few plants that exploit structural coloration, brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells. The most brilliant blue coloration known in any living tissue is found in the marble berries of ''[[Pollia condensata]]'', where a spiral structure of cellulose fibrils produces [[Bragg's law]] scattering of light. The bright gloss of [[buttercup]]s is produced by thin-film reflection by the epidermis supplemented by yellow pigmentation, and strong diffuse scattering by a layer of starch cells immediately beneath.

Structural coloration has potential for industrial, commercial and military application, with [[Biomimicry|biomimetic]] surfaces that could provide brilliant colours, adaptive [[camouflage]], efficient optical switches and low-reflectance glass.

== History ==
[[File:Micrographia title page.gif|thumb|upright|[[Robert Hooke]]'s 1665 ''[[Micrographia]]'' contains the first observations of structural colours.]]

In his 1665 book ''[[Micrographia]]'', [[Robert Hooke]] described the "fantastical" colours of the [[peacock]]'s feathers:&lt;ref name=HookeOnPeacockIridescence&gt;Hooke, Robert. Micrographia. Chapter 36 ('Observ. XXXVI. ''Of Peacoks, Ducks, and Other Feathers of Changeable Colours''.')&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The parts of the Feathers of this glorious Bird appear, through the Microscope, no less gaudy then do the whole Feathers; for, as to the naked eye 'tis evident that the stem or quill of each Feather in the tail sends out multitudes of Lateral branches, … so each of those threads in the Microscope appears a large long body, consisting of a multitude of bright reflecting parts. &lt;br /&gt;… their upper sides seem to me to consist of a multitude of thin plated bodies, which are exceeding thin, and lie very close together, and thereby, like [[Nacre|mother of Pearl]] shells, do not onely reflect a very brisk light, but tinge that light in a most curious manner; and by means of various positions, in respect of the light, they reflect back now one colour, and then another, and those most vividly.  Now, that these colours are onely fantastical ones, that is, such as arise immediately from the refractions of the light, I found by this, that water wetting these colour'd parts, destroy'd their colours, which seem'd to proceed from the alteration of the reflection and refraction.&lt;ref name=HookeOnPeacockIridescence/&gt;}}

In his 1704 book ''[[Opticks]]'', [[Isaac Newton]] described the mechanism of the colours other than the brown pigment of peacock tail feathers.&lt;ref name="ExeterIridescence"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/research/emag/themes/natural-photonics/iridescenceinlepidoptera/ | work=Natural Photonics (originally in Physics Review Magazine) | publisher=University of Exeter | title=Iridescence in Lepidoptera | date=September 1998 | accessdate=April 27, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407082122/http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/research/emag/themes/natural-photonics/iridescenceinlepidoptera/ | archivedate=April 7, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton noted that&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33504/33504-h/33504-h.htm | title=Opticks | last=Newton |first=Isaac| publisher=William Innys at the West-End of St. Paul's, London|edition=4th | date=1730| origyear=1704 | accessdate=April 27, 2012 | pages=Prop.

{{quote|The finely colour'd Feathers of some Birds, and particularly those of Peacocks Tails, do, in the very same part of the Feather, appear of several Colours in several Positions of the Eye, after the very same manner that thin Plates were found to do in the 7th and 19th Observations, and therefore their Colours arise from the thinness of the transparent parts of the Feathers; that is, from the slenderness of the very fine Hairs, or Capillamenta, which grow out of the sides of the grosser lateral Branches or Fibres of those Feathers.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;}}

[[File:NHM Chrysospalax trevelyani (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|In 1892, [[Frank Evers Beddard]] noted that  ''[[Chrysospalax]]'' golden moles' thick fur was structurally coloured.]]
[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] (1773–1829) extended Newton's [[particle theory of light]] by showing that light could also behave as a wave. He showed in 1803 that light could diffract from sharp edges or slits, creating [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Young| first=Thomas| title=Experimental Demonstration of the General Law of the Interference of Light |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |year=1804 |volume=94|doi=10.1098/rstl.1804.0001 | pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shamos |first=Morris |title=Great Experiments in Physics |year=1959 |publisher=Holt Rinehart and Winston |location=New York |pages=96–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1892 book ''[[Animal Coloration (1892 book)|Animal Coloration]]'', [[Frank Evers Beddard]] (1858–1925) acknowledged the existence of structural colours:

{{quote|The colours of animals are due either solely to the presence of definite pigments in the skin, or … beneath the skin; or they are partly caused by optical effects due to the scattering, diffraction or unequal refraction of the light rays. Colours of the latter kind are often spoken of as structural colours; they are caused by the structure of the coloured surfaces. The metallic lustre of the feathers of many birds, such as the [[Hummingbird|humming birds]], is due to the presence of excessively fine striae upon the surface of the feathers.&lt;ref name=Beddard&gt;{{cite book | title=Animal Coloration: an account of the principal facts and theories relating to the colours and markings of animals | authorlink=Frank Evers Beddard | year=1892 | last=Beddard | first=Frank Evers | publisher=Swan Sonnenschein |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5K-nT8GIn5AC | isbn=978-0-543-91406-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}}}

But Beddard then largely dismissed structural coloration, firstly as subservient to pigments: "in every case the [structural] colour needs for its display a background of dark pigment;"&lt;ref name=Beddard /&gt;{{rp|2}} and then by asserting its rarity: "By far the commonest source of colour in invertebrate animals is the presence in the skin of definite pigments",&lt;ref name=Beddard /&gt;{{rp|2}} though he does later admit that the [[Cape golden mole]] has "structural peculiarities" in its hair that "give rise to brilliant colours".&lt;ref name=Beddard /&gt;{{rp|32}}

== Principles ==

=== Structure not pigment ===
[[File:Thin film interference.svg|thumb|When light falls on a [[thin-film optics|thin film]], the waves reflected from the upper and lower surfaces travel different distances depending on the angle, so they [[Interference (optics)|interfere]].]]

{{further|Feather}}

Structural coloration is caused by interference effects rather than by pigments. [[Colour]]s are produced when a material is scored with fine parallel lines, formed of one or more parallel [[thin-film optics|thin layers]], or otherwise composed of microstructures on the scale of the colour's [[wavelength]].&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030399205001246 | title=Structural colour in animals—simple to complex optics | author=Parker, A.R., Martini, N. | journal=Optics &amp; Laser Technology |date=June–September 2006 | volume=38 | issue=4–6 | pages=315–322 | doi=10.1016/j.optlastec.2005.06.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural coloration is responsible for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the [[bee-eater]], [[kingfisher]] and [[roller]], for example), as well as many [[butterflies|butterfly]] wings, [[beetle]] wing-cases ([[elytra]]) and (while rare among [[flowers]]) the gloss of [[buttercup]] petals.&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;{{cite journal | title=Nature's Color Tricks| date=May 2012 | author=Ball, Philip |volume=306 | pages=74–79 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0512-74 | journal=Scientific American | issue=5 | pmid=22550931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kooi&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2016.0933| title = Functional optics of glossy buttercup flowers | url =https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314251397_Functional_optics_of_glossy_buttercup_flowers | journal = Journal of the Royal Society Interface | volume = 14| pages=20160933| year = 2017| last1= van der Kooi | first1 = C.J.| last2 = Elzenga| first2= J.T.M.| last3=Dijksterhuis| first3=J.| last4=Stavenga|first4=D.G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are often [[iridescent]], as in [[peacock]] feathers and [[nacre]]ous shells such as of [[pearl oyster]]s ([[Pteriidae]]) and ''[[Nautilus]]''. This is because the reflected colour depends on the viewing angle, which in turn governs the apparent spacing of the structures responsible.&lt;ref name="Wallin"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.bioscience-explained.org/ENvol1_2/pdf/paletteEN.pdf | journal=Bioscience explained | title=Nature's Palette: How animals, including humans, produce colours | year=2002 | accessdate=November 17, 2011 | author=Wallin, Margareta | volume=1 |issue=2| pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural colours can be combined with pigment colours: peacock feathers are pigmented brown with [[melanin]],&lt;ref name=HookeOnPeacockIridescence/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Smyth, S. |journal=NNIN REU Journal |date=2007 |title=What Makes the Peacock Feather Colorful? |url=http://www.nnin.org/sites/default/files/files/2007nninREUsmyth.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Makes the Peacock Feather Bright and Colorful |author=Smyth, S. | publisher=University of Alaska, Fairbanks (Honors Thesis) |year=2009 |url=https://scholarworks.alaska.edu/handle/11122/2835}}&lt;/ref&gt; while buttercup petals have both [[carotenoid]] pigments for yellowness and thin films for reflectiveness.&lt;ref name=Kooi/&gt;

=== Principle of iridescence ===
{{further|thin-film interference|iridescence}}
[[File:Bruchfläche eines Perlmuttstücks.JPG|thumb|left|[[Electron microscope|Electron micrograph]] of a fractured surface of [[nacre]] showing multiple thin layers]]

Iridescence, as explained by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1803, is created when extremely [[thin film]]s reflect part of the light falling on them from their top surfaces. The rest of the light goes through the films, and a further part of it is reflected from their bottom surfaces. The two sets of reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction. But since the bottom-reflected waves travelled a little further – controlled by the thickness and [[refractive index]] of the film, and the angle at which the light fell – the two sets of waves are [[Phase (waves)|out of phase]]. When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart – in other words at certain specific angles, they add (interfere constructively), giving a strong reflection. At other angles and phase differences, they can subtract, giving weak reflections. The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength – a pure colour – at any given angle, but other wavelengths – different colours – at different angles. So, as a thin-film structure like a butterfly's wing or bird's feather moves, it seems to change colour.&lt;ref name=ExeterIridescence /&gt;

== Mechanisms ==

=== Fixed structures ===
[[File:Butterfly magnification series collage.jpg|thumb|Butterfly wing at different magnifications reveals microstructured chitin acting as a [[diffraction grating]]]]

A number of fixed structures can create structural colours, by mechanisms including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can be far more elaborate than a single thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect.&lt;ref name=Ball /&gt; Each mechanism offers a specific solution to the problem of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.

[[File:Morpho butterfly scale christmas tree multilayer structures drawing from electron micrograph.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Drawing of 'firtree' micro-structures in ''[[Morpho]]'' butterfly wing scale]]
A '''[[diffraction grating]]''' constructed of layers of [[chitin]] and air gives rise to the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales as well as to the tail feathers of birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock's colours are created by interference, but the structures responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their [[light microscope]]s. Another way to produce a diffraction grating is with tree-shaped arrays of chitin, as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical ''[[Morpho]]'' butterflies (see drawing). Yet another variant exists in ''Parotia lawesii'', [[Lawes's parotia]], a bird of paradise. The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are V-shaped, creating thin-film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name=Ball /&gt;&lt;ref name="DoekeleBirdofParadise"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Dramatic colour changes in a bird of paradise caused by uniquely structured breast feather barbules | url=http://cbn.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2011/ProcRSocBStavenga/2011ProcRSocBStavenga.pdf | author=Stavenga, Doekele G. | journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] | year=2010 | volume=278 | pages=2098–2104 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.2293 | last2=Leertouwer | first2=H.

The holes have a diameter of about 150 [[nanometre]]s and are about the same distance apart.

[[File:Emerald Swallowtail Papilio palinurus scale structure diagrams.svg|thumb|Structural coloration through selective mirrors in the [[emerald swallowtail]]]]
'''Selective mirrors''' to create interference effects are formed of micron-sized bowl-shaped pits lined with multiple layers of chitin in the wing scales of ''Papilio palinurus'', the [[emerald swallowtail]] butterfly. These act as highly selective [[mirror]]s for two wavelengths of light. Yellow light is reflected directly from the centres of the pits; blue light is reflected twice by the sides of the pits. The combination appears green, but can be seen as an array of yellow spots surrounded by blue circles under a microscope.&lt;ref name=Ball /&gt;

Below these cells is a layer two or three cells thick containing dark brown [[tannin]]s. ''Pollia'' produces a stronger colour than the wings of ''Morpho'' butterflies, and is one of the first instances of structural coloration known from any plant. Each cell has its own thickness of stacked fibres, making it reflect a different colour from its neighbours, and producing a [[pixellated]] or [[pointillism|pointillist]] effect with different blues speckled with brilliant green, purple and red dots. The fibres in any one cell are either left-handed or right-handed, so each cell [[circular polarization|circularly polarizes]] the light it reflects in one direction or the other. ''Pollia'' is the first organism known to show such random polarization of light, which, nevertheless does not have a visual function, as the seed-eating birds that visit this plant species are not able to perceive polarised light.&lt;ref&gt;"Visual Ecology" by Cronin, T.W., Johson, S., Marshall, N.J. and Warrant, E.J.

'''Thin film with diffuse reflector''', based on the top two layers of a buttercup's petals. The brilliant yellow gloss derives from a combination, rare among plants, of yellow pigment and structural coloration. The very smooth upper epidermis acts as a reflective and iridescent thin film; for example, in ''[[Ranunculus acris]]'', the layer is 2.7 micrometres thick. The unusual starch cells form a diffuse but strong reflector, enhancing the flower's brilliance. The curved petals form a paraboloidal dish which directs the sun's heat to the reproductive parts at the centre of the flower, keeping it some degrees Celsius above the ambient temperature.&lt;ref name=Kooi/&gt;

'''Surface gratings''', consisting on ordered surface features due exposure of ordered muscle cells on [[cuts of meat]]. The structural coloration on meat cuts appears only after the ordered pattern of muscle [[Myofibrils|fibrils]] is exposed and light is diffracted by the proteins in the fibrils. The coloration or wavelength of the diffracted light depends on the angle of observation and can be enhanced by covering the meat with translucent foils. Roughening the surface or removing water content by drying causes the structure to collapse, thus, the structural coloration to disappear.&lt;ref name=foods&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/2/4/499 | title=Foods | work=Iridescence in Meat Caused by Surface Gratings | date=November 2013 | accessdate=March 1, 2014 | author=Martinez-Hurtado, J L | volume=2 | pages=499–506 |doi=10.3390/foods2040499 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variable structures ===

[[File:Variable ring patterns on mantles of the blue-ringed octopus Hapalochlaena lunulata.png|thumb|left|400px|Variable ring patterns on mantles of ''Hapalochlaena lunulata'']]

Some animals including [[cephalopods]] like squid are able to vary their colours rapidly for both [[camouflage]] and signalling. The mechanisms include reversible [[proteins]] which can be switched between two configurations. The configuration of [[reflectin]] proteins in [[chromatophore]] cells in the skin of the ''[[Doryteuthis pealeii]]'' squid is controlled by electric charge. When charge is absent, the proteins stack together tightly, forming a thin, more reflective layer; when charge is present, the molecules stack more loosely, forming a thicker layer. Since chromatophores contain multiple reflectin layers, the switch changes the layer spacing and hence the colour of light that is reflected.&lt;ref name=Ball /&gt;

Blue-ringed octopuses spend much of their time hiding in crevices whilst displaying effective camouflage patterns with their dermal [[chromatophore]] cells.  If they are provoked, they quickly change colour, becoming bright yellow with each of the 50-60 rings flashing bright iridescent blue within a third of a second.  In the [[greater blue-ringed octopus]] (''Hapalochlaena lunulata''), the rings contain multi-layer [[Chromatophore#Iridophores and leucophores|iridophore]]s.  These are arranged to reflect blue–green light in a wide viewing direction. The fast flashes of the blue rings are achieved using muscles under neural control. Under normal circumstances, each ring is hidden by contraction of muscles above the iridophores. When these relax and muscles outside the ring contract, the bright blue rings are exposed.&lt;ref name="Mathger2012"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mäthger, L.M., Bell, G.R., Kuzirian, A.M., Allen, J.J. and Hanlon, R.T. |year=2012 |title=How does the blue-ringed octopus (Hapalochlaena lunulata) flash its blue rings? |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=215 |issue=21 |pages=3752–3757 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3752.full |doi=10.1242/jeb.076869 |pmid=23053367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hybrid switchgear.jpg|thumb|This circuit breaker uses both SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and air as insulation.]]

In an [[electric power system]], '''switchgear''' is the combination of electrical disconnect switches, [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]]s or [[circuit breaker]]s used to control, protect and isolate electrical equipment. Switchgear is used both to de-energize equipment to allow work to be done and to clear [[fault (power engineering)|fault]]s downstream. This type of equipment is directly linked to the reliability of the [[electricity]] supply.

The earliest central power stations used simple open [[knife switch]]es, mounted on insulating panels of [[marble]] or [[asbestos]]. Power levels and voltages rapidly escalated, making opening manually operated switches too dangerous for anything other than [[Galvanic isolation|isolation]] of a de-energized circuit. Oil-filled equipment allowed arc energy to be contained and safely controlled. By the early 20th century, a switchgear line-up would be a metal-enclosed structure with electrically operated switching elements, using oil circuit breakers. Today, oil-filled equipment has largely been replaced by air-blast, vacuum, or [[sulfur hexafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] equipment, allowing large currents and power levels to be safely controlled by automatic equipment.

High-voltage switchgear was invented at the end of the 19th century for operating [[Electric motor|motors]] and other electric machines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://v3.espacenet.com/origdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=GB189320069&amp;F=0&amp;QPN=GB189320069 British Pattern GB 20069 ''Improvements in Apparatus for Controlling the Application or Use of Electric Currents of High Tension and Great Quantity'' in 1893], on espacenet.com&lt;/ref&gt; The technology has been improved over time and can now be used with voltages up to 1,100&amp;nbsp;kV.&lt;ref name="1100kV"&gt;Lin Jiming et al., ''Transient characteristics of 1 100 kV circuit-breakers'', ''International Symposium on International Standards for Ultra High Voltage'', Beijing, Juillet 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, switchgear in [[Electrical substation|substations]] are located on both the high- and low-voltage sides of large power [[transformer]]s. The switchgear on the low-voltage side of the transformers may be located in a building, with medium-voltage circuit breakers for distribution circuits, along with metering, control, and protection equipment. For industrial applications, a [[transformer]] and switchgear line-up may be combined in one housing, called a unitized [[electrical substation|substation]] (USS).

==Components==
A switchgear has 2 types of components:
*Power conducting components, such as switches, circuit breakers, fuses, and lightning arrestors, that conduct or interrupt the flow of electrical power.
*[[Control system]]s such as control panels, current transformers, potential transformers, protective relays, and associated circuitry, that monitor, control, and protect the power conducting components.

==Functions==
One of the basic functions of switchgear is protection, which is interruption of short-circuit and overload fault currents while maintaining service to unaffected circuits. Switchgear also provides isolation of circuits from power supplies. Switchgear is also used to enhance system availability by allowing more than one source to feed a load.

==History==
[[Image:Schaltanlage um1910.jpg|thumb|Early switchgear (about 1910)]]
Switchgears are as old as [[electricity generation]]. The first models were very primitive: all components were simply fixed to a wall. Later they were mounted on wooden panels. For reasons of fire protection, the wood was replaced by [[slate]] or [[marble]]. This led to a further improvement, because the switching and measuring devices could be attached to the front, while the wiring was on the back.&lt;ref&gt;(German) Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft (ed) ''AEG Hilfsbuch für elektrische Licht- und Kraftanlagen 6th Ed.'', W. Girardet, Essen 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

==Housing==
Switchgear for lower voltages may be entirely enclosed within a building. For higher voltages (over about 66 kV), switchgear is typically mounted outdoors and insulated by air, although this requires a large amount of space. Gas-insulated switchgear saves space compared with air-insulated equipment, although the equipment cost is higher. Oil insulated switchgear presents an oil spill hazard.

Switches may be manually operated or have motor drives to allow for remote control.

==Circuit breaker types ==
A switchgear may be a simple open-air isolator switch or it may be insulated by some other substance. An effective although more costly form of switchgear is the gas-insulated switchgear (GIS), where the conductors and contacts are insulated by pressurized sulfur hexafluoride [[gas]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). Other common types are oil or vacuum insulated switchgear.

The combination of equipment within the switchgear enclosure allows them to interrupt fault currents of thousands of amps. A [[circuit breaker]] (within a switchgear enclosure) is the primary component that interrupts fault currents. The quenching of the arc when the circuit breaker pulls apart the contacts (disconnects the circuit) requires careful design. Circuit breakers fall into these six types:

===Oil===
[[File:TMW 50981 Schnittmodell Hochspannung-Leistungschalter HPF500F.jpg|thumb|Cutaway model of an oil-filled high-voltage circuit breaker]]
Oil circuit breakers rely upon vaporization of some of the oil to blast a jet of oil along the path of the arc. The vapor released by the arcing consists of [[hydrogen gas]].
[[Mineral oil]] has better insulating property than air. Whenever there is a separation of current carrying contacts in the oil, the arc in circuit breaker is initialized at the moment of separation of contacts, and due to this arc the oil is vaporized and decomposed in mostly [[hydrogen gas]] and ultimately creates a hydrogen bubble around the [[electric arc]]. This highly compressed gas bubble around the arc prevents re-striking of the arc after current reaches zero crossing of the cycle. The oil circuit breaker is one of the oldest type of circuit breakers.

===Air===
Air circuit breakers may use compressed air (puff) or the magnetic force of the arc itself to elongate the arc. As the length of the sustainable arc is dependent on the available voltage, the elongated arc will eventually exhaust itself. Alternatively, the contacts are rapidly swung into a small sealed chamber, the escaping of the displaced air thus blowing out the arc.

Circuit breakers are usually able to terminate all current flow very quickly: typically between 30&amp;nbsp;ms and 150&amp;nbsp;ms depending upon the age and construction of the device.

===Gas===
{{main article|Sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker}}
Gas (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) circuit breakers sometimes stretch the arc using a [[magnetic field]], and then rely upon the dielectric strength of the SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; gas to quench the stretched arc.

===Hybrid===
{{main article|Hybrid switchgear modules}}
Hybrid switchgear is a type which combines the components of traditional air-insulated switchgear (AIS) and SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) technologies. It is characterized by a compact and modular design, which encompasses several different functions in one module.

===Vacuum===
Circuit breakers with [[vacuum interrupter]]s have minimal arcing characteristics (as there is nothing to ionize other than the contact material), so the arc quenches when it is stretched by a small amount (&amp;lt;2–8&amp;nbsp;mm). Near zero current the arc is not hot enough to maintain a plasma, and current ceases; the gap can then withstand the rise of voltage. Vacuum circuit breakers are frequently used in modern medium-voltage switchgear to 40,500 volts. Unlike the other types, they are inherently unsuitable for interrupting DC faults. The reason vacuum circuit breakers are unsuitable for breaking high DC voltages is that with DC there is no "current zero" period. The plasma arc can feed itself by continuing to gasify the contact material.

===Carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)===
Breakers that use [[carbon dioxide]] as the insulating and arc extinguishing medium work on the same principles as a [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) breaker. Because SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[greenhouse gas]] more potent than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, by switching from SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; it is possible to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 10 tons during the product lifecycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Switzerland : ABB breaks new ground with environment friendly high-voltage circuit breaker. |url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Switzerland+%3A+ABB+breaks+new+ground+with+environment+friendly...-a0300987882|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protective circuitry==

===Circuit breakers and fuses===
Circuit breakers and fuses disconnect when current exceeds a predetermined safe level.  However they cannot sense other critical faults, such as unbalanced currents—for example, when a transformer winding contacts ground.  By themselves, circuit breakers and fuses cannot distinguish between short circuits and high levels of electrical demand.

===Merz-Price circulating current scheme===
Differential protection depends upon [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's current law (KCL)|Kirchhoff's current law]], which states that the sum of currents entering or leaving a circuit node must equal zero.  Using this principle to implement differential protection, any section of a conductive path may be considered a node.  The conductive path could be a transmission line, a winding of a transformer, a winding in a motor, or a winding in the stator of an alternator.  This form of protection works best when both ends of the conductive path are physically close to each other.  This scheme was invented  in Great Britain by [[Charles Hesterman Merz]] and [[Bernard Price]].&lt;ref name="Black1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Monro Black|title=The History of Electric Wires and Cables|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUCieJjeQ-wC&amp;pg=PA101|date=January 1983|publisher=IET|isbn=978-0-86341-001-7|pages=101–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two identical current transformers are used for each winding of a transformer, stator, or other device.  The current transformers are placed around opposite ends of a winding.  The current through both ends should be identical.  A protective relay detects any imbalance in currents, and trips circuit breakers to isolate the device.  In the case of a transformer, the circuit breakers on both the primary and secondary would open.

===Distance relays===
A short circuit at the end of a long transmission line appears similar to a normal load, because the impedance of the transmission line limits the fault current.  A distance relay detects a fault by comparing the voltage and current on the transmission line.  A large current along with a voltage drop indicates a fault.

==Classification==
Several different classifications of switchgear can be made:&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Smeaton (ed) ''Switchgear and Control Handbook 3rd Ed.'', McGraw Hill, New York 1997 {{ISBN|0-07-058451-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{div col end}}
A single line-up may incorporate several different types of devices, for example, air-insulated bus, vacuum circuit breakers, and manually operated switches may all exist in the same row of cubicles.

Ratings, design, specifications and details of switchgear are set by a multitude of standards. In North America mostly [[IEEE]] and [[ANSI]] standards are used, much of the rest of the world uses [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standards, sometimes with local national derivatives or variations.

==Safety==
[[Image:Disjoncteurs 245kV.jpg|thumb|Disjoncteurs 245 kV dans un poste AIS|245&amp;nbsp;kV circuit breaker in air insulated substation]]
[[Image:GIS 420kV.jpg|thumb|Poste blindé (GIS) 420 kV| 420&amp;nbsp;kV gas insulated switchgear]]
To help ensure safe operation sequences of switchgear, [[trapped key interlocking]] provides predefined scenarios of operation. For example, if only one of two sources of supply are permitted to be connected at a given time, the interlock scheme may require that the first switch must be opened to release a key that will allow closing the second switch. Complex schemes are possible.

Indoor switchgear can also be type tested for internal arc containment (e.g., IEC 62271-200). This test is important for user safety as modern switchgear is capable of switching large currents.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.energy.siemens.com/cms/00000013/aune/Documents/Medium%20Voltage%20Arc%20Fault%20Containment.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318070617/https://www.energy.siemens.com/cms/00000013/aune/Documents/Medium%20Voltage%20Arc%20Fault%20Containment.pdf |date=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switchgear is often inspected using [[thermal imaging]] to assess the state of the system and predict failures before they occur. Other methods include [[partial discharge]] (PD) testing, using either fixed or portable testers, and [[acoustic emission]] testing using surface-mounted transducers (for oil equipment) or [[Ultrasonic testing|ultrasonic]] detectors used in outdoor switchyards. Temperature sensors fitted to cables to the switchgear can permanently monitor temperature build-up. SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; equipment is invariably fitted with alarms and interlocks to warn of loss of pressure, and to prevent operation if the pressure falls too low.

The increasing awareness of dangers associated with high fault levels has resulted in network operators specifying closed-door operations for earth switches and racking breakers. Many European power companies have banned operators from switch rooms while operating. [[Remote racking system]]s are available which allow an operator to rack switchgear from a remote location without the need to wear a protective arc flash hazard suit. Switchgear systems require continuous maintenance and servicing to remain safe to use and fully optimized to provide such high voltages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://johnsonphillips.co.uk/services/switchgear/|title=Switchgear Systems and Services|last=|first=|date=|website=johnsonphillips.co.uk|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Arba domo en la parko de la Château de Langeais 02.jpg|thumb|275px|A tree house in the park of the [[Château de Langeais]] in the [[Loire Valley]], France]]
A '''tree house''', '''tree fort''' or '''treeshed''' is a platform or [[building]] constructed around, next to or among the [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] or [[branch]]es of one or more mature [[tree]]s while above ground level. Tree houses can be used for recreation, work space, habitation, and observation.

==Use==
===Prehistoric hypotheses===
Building tree platforms or [[nest]]s as a shelter from dangers on the ground is a habit of all the [[great ape]]s, and may have been inherited by [[human]]s. It is true that evidence of prehistoric man-made tree houses have never been found by [[paleoanthropologist]]s, but remains of wooden tree houses would not remain. However, evidence for cave accommodation, terrestrial man-made rock shelters, and bonfires should be possible to find if they had existed, but are scarce from earlier than 40000 years ago. This has led to a hypothesis that archaic humans may have lived in trees until about 40000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Donald R Perry, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fsF1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT392&amp;dq=%22tree+house%22+%22homo+sapiens%22&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8lb6A5IXPAhVCBywKHeZmDY0Q6AEISTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tree%20houses%22%20&amp;f=false  Interpreting evidence: Tree houses], 21st Century Anthropology: A Reference Handbook, SAGE Publications, 2010, page 365-366&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Among indigenous people === 
Even today, treehouses are built by some indigenous people in order to escape the danger and adversity on the ground in some parts of the [[tropics]]. It has been claimed that the majority of the [[Korowai people|Korowai]] clans, a [[Papuan peoples|Papuan]] tribe in the southeast of [[Irian Jaya]],  live in tree houses on their isolated territory as protection against a tribe of neighbouring [[Headhunting|head-hunters]], the [[Citak]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/human-planet-sustainable-living-korowai-tribe-and-tree-houses/11965.html Sustainable living: Korowai tribe and tree houses]. BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] revealed in 2018 that the Korowai had constructed tree houses "for the benefit of overseas programme makers" and did not actually live in them&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/04/scene-from-human-planet-documentary-was-faked-bbc-admits BBC admits treehouse scene from Human Planet series was faked]. The Guardian.&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the Korowai people still build tree houses, but not elevated on [[Stilt house|stilts]] as in the BBC scene, but fastened to trees in the tree trunks of tall trees, to protect occupants and store food from [[scavenger|scavenging]] animals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/03/980309043026.htm Head-Hunters Drove Papuan Tribe Into Tree-Houses]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern societies===
Modern tree houses are usually built as a hut for children or for leisure purposes. Modern tree houses may also be integrated into existing hotel facilities.

Along with subterranean and ground level houses, tree houses are an option for building eco-friendly houses in remote forest areas, because they do not require a clearing of a certain area of forest. However, the wildlife, climate and illumination on ground level in areas of dense close-[[canopy (forest)|canopy]] forest is not desirable to some people.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Support methods and technology==
[[File:Treehouse access and roundwalk.jpg|thumb|left|180px|upright|A [[stairway]] and roundwalk]]
There are numerous techniques to fasten the structure to the tree which seek to minimize tree damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/jacopogozzi/docs/sustentabilityarchitecturethesis |title=Architecture Thesis, bachelor degree }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of modern tree houses usually starts with the creation of a rigid platform, on which the house will be placed; the platform will lean (possibly on the corners) on the branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garden Tree House Design|url=http://www.cheekymonkeytreehouses.com/home.php?Lang=English|publisher=Cheeky Monkey Tree Houses|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In case there aren’t enough suitable supports, the methods to support the platform are:
* '''Struts and stilts'''
Struts and stilts are used for relieving weights on a lower elevation or straight to the ground; Tree houses supported by [[stilts]] weigh much less on the tree and help to prevent stress, potential [[Strain (injury)|strain]], and injury caused by puncture holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treetopbuilders.net/tree-house-construction/fasteners.html |title=Tree injury |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stilts are typically anchored into the ground with concrete although new designs, such as the “Diamond Pier”, accelerates installation time and they are less invasive for the root system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinfoundations.com/ |title=Diamond Pier |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stilts are considered the easiest method of supporting larger tree houses, and can also increase structural support and safety.
* '''Stay rods'''
Stay rods are used for relieving weights on a higher elevation. These systems are particularly useful to control movements caused by wind or tree growth, however they are the used less often, due to the natural limits of the systems. Higher elevation and more branches tailing off decreases capacity and increases wind sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bahamon | first = Alejandro | authorlink = | title = Treehouses Living a Dream | publisher = Collins Design | year = 2007 | location =New York, NY | pages = 8 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-06-078001-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As building materials for hanging are used ropes, wire cables, tension fasteners, springs etc.
* '''Friction and tension fasteners'''

Friction and tension fasteners are the most common noninvasive methods of securing tree houses. They do not use [[Nail (fastener)|nails]], [[screws]] or [[Bolted joint|bolts]], but instead grip the beams to the trunk by means of counter-beam, threaded bars, or tying.
* '''Invasive methods'''
Invasive methods are all methods that use nails, screws, bolts, kingpins, etc. Because these methods require punctures in the tree, they must be planned properly in order to minimize stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetreehouseguide.com/constructiontutorials/whattypeofsupport.htm |title=friction fastening advice |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all species of plants suffer from puncture in the same way, depending partly on whether the sap conduits run in the pith or in the bark. Nails are generally not recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetreehouseguide.com/constructiontutorials/dangerous.htm |title=Danger of nails |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special kind of bolt developed in the 1990s called a [[treehouse attachment bolt]] (TAB) can support greater weights than earlier methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miskimon|first=Robert|title=The Complete Guide to Building Your Own Tree House: For Parents and Adults Who Are Kids at Heart|year=2008|publisher=Atlantic Publishing Company|isbn=1-60138-244-8|pages=88–89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ynNOj4660UC&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=garnier%20limb&amp;pg=PA89#v=onepage&amp;q=garnier%20limb&amp;f=false|author2=Chmienlnicki, Steven |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehousesupplies.com/TAB-vs-GL-specs_a/266.htm |title=Creation of the TAB |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://treehouses.com/joomla/index.php/construction/garnier-limb | title=Official Garnier Limb Origin and Histree | publisher=Out'n'About Treesort, LLC | accessdate=28 December 2013 | author=Garnier, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity==
[[File:The Treehouse - geograph.org.uk - 32426.jpg|thumb|275px|Treehouse at [[The Alnwick Garden]]s in the United Kingdom, with walkways through the tree canopy]]
Since the mid-1990s, recreational tree houses have enjoyed a rise in popularity in countries such as the United States and parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henderson | first = Paula | authorlink = |author2=Adam Mornement  | title = Treehouses | publisher = Frances Lincoln Ltd | year = 2005 | location = London, UK | pages = 7 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7112-2437-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been due to increased [[Disposable and discretionary income|disposable income]], better technology for builders, research into safe building practices and an increased interest in [[environmental issue]]s, particularly [[sustainable living]]. This growing popularity is also reflected in a rise of social media channels, websites, and television shows specially dedicated to featuring remarkable tree houses around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treehousemap.com|title=Treehouses around the world on a map|website=Treehouse Map|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 [[File:Tree house1.jpg|thumb|Tree house built with steps]]
Increased popularity has, in turn, given rise to demand for businesses covering all building and [[design]] work for clients. There are over 30 businesses in Europe and the USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetreehouseguide.com/links-builders.htm |title=Commercial treehouse builder list |accessdate=2007-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; specializing in the construction of tree houses of various degrees of permanence and sophistication, from children's play structures to fully functioning homes.

Popularity of tree house hotels is equally growing,{{when|date=July 2017}} with a number of booking websites offering accommodation in tree houses.

==Building regulations==
Many areas of the world have no specific planning laws for tree houses, so the legal issues can be confusing to both the builder and the local planning departments only. Treehouses can be exempt, partially regulated or fully regulated - depending on the locale.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In some cases, tree houses are exempted from standard building regulations, as they're considered outside of the regulations specification. An exemption may be given to a builder if the tree house is in a remote or non-urban location. Alternatively, a tree house may be included in the same category as structures such as garden sheds, sometimes called a "temporary structure". There may be restrictions on height, distance from boundary and privacy for nearby properties. There are various [[wikt:grey area|grey areas]] in these laws, as they were not specifically designed for tree-borne structures. A very small number of planning departments have specific regulations for tree houses, which set out clearly what may be built and where. For safety during the tree house construction, it is usually best to do as much work as possible on the ground, taking long-term viability into consideration.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Protest communities==
The tree house has been central to various environmental protest communities around the world, in a technique, popularized, known as [[tree sitting]]. This method may be used in protests against proposed road building or [[old growth]] forestry operations. Tree houses are used as a method of defence from which it is difficult and costly to safely evict the protesters and begin work. [[Julia Butterfly Hill]] is a particularly well known tree sitter who occupied a [[Sequoia sempervirens|Californian Redwood]] for 738 days, saving the tree and others in the immediate area. Her accommodation consisted of two 3m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (29 sq ft) platforms 60&amp;nbsp;m (200&amp;nbsp;ft) above the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henderson | first = Paula | authorlink = |author2=Adam Mornement  | title = Treehouses | publisher = Frances Lincoln Ltd | year = 2005 | location = London, UK | pages = 65 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7112-2437-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

]]
A '''treenail''', also trenail, trennel, or trunnel, is a wooden peg, pin, or [[dowel]] used to fasten pieces of wood together, especially in [[timber frame]]s, [[covered bridge]]s, wooden [[shipbuilding]] and [[boat building]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Jay Dearborn, and Nicolas Verton. ''A Creole lexicon architecture, landscape, people''. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2004. Print. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is driven into a hole bored through two (or more) pieces of structural wood ([[mortise and tenon]]).

==History and general use==
The use of wood as a tenon can be traced back over 7,000 years, as archaeologist have found traces of wood nails in the excavation of early Germanic sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wood: A History|last=Radkau|first=Joachim|publisher=Polity|year=2012|isbn=0745646883|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trenails are notoriously economical and readily available, making them a common early building material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Honey Locust]] is a favorite wood when making trunnels in shipbuilding due to its strength and rot resistance, while red oak is typical in buildings. Traditionally treenails and pegs were made by splitting bolts of wood with a [[froe]] and shaping them with a [[drawknife]] on a [[shaving horse]]. Treenails are cut from a single piece of wood and perform well because of the natural grain. The grain of the treenail runs perpendicular to the grain of the receiving mortises which adds structural strength. Treenails are typically 1.25"-1.5" (32-38&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter and are hand whittled with rough facets. The mortise is drilled 1/16" (2&amp;nbsp;mm) smaller than the treenail to create a tight fit and take advantage of friction in the mortise. In cases where the treenail is {{convert|24|in|cm}} or longer, the treenail should be shaped 1/8 inch (3&amp;nbsp;mm) smaller than the other half. In the same case the mortise is drilled in two parts, with a smaller auger for the smaller part of the treenail and a typical auger for the standard part. Other trenails are tapered with the large end being 1/8" longer than the mortise. After treenails are hammered into the mortise, they can be trimmed, split, and wedged with a small piece of oak that increases friction force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Elements of Wood Ship Construction|last=Curtis|first=W.H.|publisher=McGrawHill Book Company|year=1919|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative to the wedge, the treenail can receive a plug or a punch to the center that expands the entire circumference. While this method prevents leaks by reducing gaps, plugs and punches are more likely to fall out in cold temperatures. Ideally, the nose of the treenail is driven 4–5&amp;nbsp;cm clear of the timber before being trimmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Maritime Archaeology of Ships: Innovation and Social Change in Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe|last=Adams|first=J.R.|publisher=Oxbow Books|year=2013|isbn=1842172972|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike metal nails, trenails can not be removed (without great effort) or reused. As the wood shrinks or expand the fibers create a friction that interlocks it into the mortise snugly. If a treenail breaks or fails but the wood it is fastening remains intact the remaining trenail can be cut out and replaced with a larger treenail that fits snugly. In addition, treenails have the ability to move over time and retain structural integrity. Because both the mortise and the tenon are wood, the trenail does not stress the mortise to the point of failure during movement including seismic forces and grade settlement.{{citation needed|date = April 2018}}

Early mortise and tenon trusses with spans of less than 30 feet used trenail fasteners. When used in a truss, the connecting mortises are drilled off center such that when the treenail is inserted it creates a tighter joint. Because of the large number of trenails required in a truss, the treenails can be turned on a lathe with a head and a tapered end, often kept extra-long for the tightest fit. The bottom chord often requires 2-3 pegs and is the weakest part of the truss. Hence the treenail can not prevent failure in spans of over 30 feet. In cases where significant shrinkage may occur, it may be necessary to use iron U-straps or reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Lee H.|date=1996|title=Early Wooden Truss Connections vs. Wood Shrinkage: From Mortise-and-Tenon Joints to Bolted Connections|jstor=1504495|journal=APT Bulletin|volume=27|issue=1/2|pages=11–23|doi=10.2307/1504495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They had the advantage of not giving rise to "nail-sickness", a term for decay accelerated and concentrated around metal fasteners. Increased water content causes wood to expand, so that treenails gripped the [[Plank (wood)|planks]] tighter as they absorbed water.&lt;ref&gt;Kettunen, P. O., ''Wood Structure and Properties''. Uetikon-Zuerich: Trans Tech Publications, 2006. 377. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the treenail was a different wood species than the planking it usually caused rot. Treenails and iron nails were most common until the 1780s when copper nails over copper sheathing became more popular.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=W.|date=1986-01-01|title=Historical and present-day references concerning impact on wood|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0734743X86900035|journal=International Journal of Impact Engineering|volume=4|issue=3|pages=161–174|doi=10.1016/0734-743X(86)90003-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the 1870s, the merchant navy ships used treenails and iron bolts, while the higher class ships used the copper and yellow metal bolts and dumps. In the 1870s tradition, treenails were typically used in a ratio of four treenails to one bolt with the exception that sometimes the number of bolts was increased. In later corvettes the ratio was changed to two treenails to one bolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gTYEAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=wood%20architecture%20treenails&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u_E5JSjt4r&amp;sig=lRPNWlfuYl7ilnEWvCEI64uYZ1k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5k8ihiPfXAhWkm-AKHYugDSYQ6AEIUjAO#v=onepage&amp;q=wood%20architecture%20treenails&amp;f=false|title=Naval Architecture: A Treatise on Laying Off and Building Wood, Iron, and Composite Ships|last=Thearle|first=Samuel James Pope|date=1876|publisher=W.

The '''uniflow''' type of [[steam engine]] uses steam that flows in one direction only in each half of the cylinder. [[Thermal efficiency]] is increased in the compound and multiple expansion types of steam engine by separating expansion into steps in separate cylinders; in the uniflow design, thermal efficiency is achieved by having a temperature gradient along the cylinder. Steam always enters at the hot ends of the cylinder and exhausts through ports at the cooler centre. By this means, the relative heating and cooling of the cylinder walls is reduced.

== Design details ==
[[File:Thinktank Birmingham - object 1956S00658(1).jpg|thumb| [[W &amp; J Galloway &amp; Sons|Galloway]] uniflow steam engine, now in [[Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum]]]]
Steam entry is usually controlled by [[poppet valve]]s (which act similarly to those used in [[internal combustion engine]]s) that are operated by a [[camshaft]]. The inlet valves open to admit steam when minimum expansion volume has been reached at the start of the stroke. For a period of the crank cycle, steam is admitted, and the poppet inlet is then closed, allowing continued expansion of the steam during the stroke, driving the piston. Near the end of the stroke, the piston will uncover a ring of exhaust ports mounted radially around the centre of the cylinder. These ports are connected by a manifold and piping to the condenser, lowering the pressure in the chamber below that of the atmosphere causing rapid exhausting. Continued rotation of the crank moves the piston. From the animation, the features of a uniflow engine can be seen, with a large piston almost half the length of the cylinder, poppet inlet valves at either end, a camshaft (whose motion is derived from that of the driveshaft) and a central ring of exhaust ports.

=== Advantages ===

Uniflow engines potentially allow greater expansion in a single cylinder without the relatively cool exhaust steam flowing across the hot end of the working cylinder and steam ports of a conventional "counterflow" steam engine during the exhaust stroke.  This condition allows higher thermal efficiency.  The exhaust ports are only open for a small fraction of the piston stroke, with the exhaust ports closed just after the piston begins traveling toward the admission end of the cylinder.  The steam remaining within the cylinder after the exhaust ports are closed is trapped, and this trapped steam is compressed by the returning piston.  This is thermodynamically desirable as it preheats the hot end of the cylinder before the admission of steam. However, the risk of excessive compression often results in small auxiliary exhaust ports being included at the cylinder heads. Such a design is called a '''semi-uniflow engine'''.

Engines of this type usually have multiple cylinders in an in-line arrangement, and may be single- or double-acting. A particular advantage of this type is that the valves may be operated by the effect of multiple camshafts, and by changing the relative phase of these camshafts, the amount of steam admitted may be increased for high torque at low speed, and may be decreased at cruising speed for economy of operation.  Alternatively, designs using a more-complex cam surface allowed the varying of timing by shifting the entire camshaft longitudinally compared to its follower, allowing the admission timing to be varied. (The camshaft could be shifted by mechanical or hydraulic devices.) And, by changing the absolute phase, the engine's direction of rotation may be changed. The uniflow design also maintains a constant temperature gradient through the cylinder, avoiding passing hot and cold steam through the same end of the cylinder.

=== Disadvantages ===

In practice, the uniflow engine has a number of operational shortcomings. The large expansion ratio requires a large cylinder volume. To gain the maximum potential work from the engine a high reciprocation rate is required, typically 80% faster than a double-acting counterflow type engine. This causes the opening times of the inlet valves to be very short, putting great strain on a delicate mechanical part. In order to withstand the huge mechanical forces encountered, engines have to be heavily built and a large flywheel is required to smooth out the variations in torque as the steam pressure rapidly rises and falls in the cylinder. Because there is a thermal gradient across the cylinder, the metal of the wall expands to different extents. This requires the cylinder bore to be machined wider in the cool center than at the hot ends. If the cylinder is not heated correctly, or if water enters, the delicate balance can be upset causing seizure mid-stroke or, potentially, destruction.

== History ==
The uniflow engine was first used in Britain in 1827 by [[Jacob Perkins]] and was patented in 1885 by [[Leonard Jennett Todd]]. It was popularised by German engineer [[Johann Stumpf (engineer)|Johann Stumpf]] in 1909, with the first commercial stationary engine produced a year previously in 1908.

=== Steam locomotives ===
The uniflow principle was mainly used for industrial power generation, but was also tried in a few railway locomotives in England, such as the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] uniflow locomotives [[NER Class S|No 825]] of 1913, and [[NER Class Z|No 2212]] of 1919,&lt;ref name=UniflowLocos&gt;[http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/uniflowloco/uniflowloco.htm The Museum of Retro Technology – Uniflow Steam Locomotives] ''(Accessed 7 August 2010)''&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Midland Railway Paget locomotive]]. Experiments were also made in France,&lt;ref name="French high-pressure locomotive"&gt;[http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/frenchHP/frenchHP.htm French high-pressure locomotive] ''(Accessed 20 March 2017)''&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, the United States and Russia.&lt;ref name=UniflowLocos /&gt; In no case were the results encouraging enough for further development to be undertaken.

=== Steam wagons ===
The first large-scale utilization of a Uniflow engine was in Atkinson steam wagons, in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=1918|title=Commercial Motor, 15th August, 1918|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skinner Unaflow ===
The final commercial evolution of the uniflow engine occurred in the United States during the late 1930s and 1940s by the Skinner Engine Company with the development of the Compound Unaflow Marine Steam Engine.&lt;ref name=UniflowLocos /&gt; This engine operates in a [[Steeple compound engine|steeple compound configuration]] and provides efficiencies approaching contemporary diesels. Many [[Train ferry|car ferries]] on the [[Great Lakes]] were so equipped, one of which is still operating, {{SS|Badger}} of 1952.  The {{sclass-|Casablanca| escort carrier}}, the most prolific [[aircraft carrier]] design in history, used two 5-cylinder Skinner Unaflow engines, but these were not steeple compounds. A non-compound Skinner Uniflow remained in service until 2013 in the Great Lakes cement carrier {{SS|St. Marys Challenger}}, installed when the vessel was re-powered in 1950.

In small sizes (less than about {{convert|1000|hp|abbr=on}}), reciprocating steam engines are much more efficient than steam turbines. [[White Cliffs Solar Power Station]] used a three-cylinder uniflow engine with "[[Bash valve|Bash]]"-type admission valves to generate about 25 kW electrical output.

=== Home-made conversions of two-stroke engines ===
The single-acting uniflow steam engine configuration closely resembles that of a [[two-stroke]] internal combustion engine, and it is possible to convert a two-stroke engine to a uniflow steam engine by feeding the cylinder with steam via a "[[bash valve]]" fitted in place of the spark plug.&lt;ref name="bashvalve" &gt;[http://www.firedragon.com/~kap/SteamTopics/bashvalve.html Bash Valve] - description&lt;/ref&gt; As the rising piston nears the top of its stroke, it knocks open the bash valve to admit a pulse of steam. The valve closes automatically as the piston descends, and the steam is exhausted through the existing cylinder porting. The inertia of the flywheel then carries the piston back to the top of its stroke against the compression, as it does in the original form of the engine. Also like the original, the conversion is not self-starting and must be turned over by an external power source to start. An example of such a conversion is the steam-powered moped, which is started by pedalling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steamcar.net/steam-ped.html Steam-powered moped]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It was the world's first offshore [[wave power|wave energy]] converter.

==History==
The 237 tons prototype Wave Dragon was towed in March 2003 to the first test site at the Danish Wave Energy Test Center in [[Limfjord|Nissum Bredning fjord]]. It was tested until January 2005. In 2006 a modified prototype was deployed to another test site with more energetic wave climate. The prototype was scrapped in 2011.

==Technology==
[[File:WaveDragon.JPG|thumb|right|Wave Dragon seen from reflector, prototype 1:4½]]
Wave Dragon is a floating, slack-moored energy converter of the 'overtopping' type which can be deployed as a single unit, or in arrays of up to 200 units; the output of such an array would have a capacity comparable to traditional fossil-fuel power plants.

The first prototype was connected to the power grid in 2003 and is currently deployed in [[Nissum Bredning, Denmark]]. Long term testing is under way to determine system performance; i.e. availability and power production under different weather and tide conditions. A multi-MW deployment is expected in 2009.

The Wave Dragon concept combines existing, mature offshore and hydro turbine technology. In the Wave Dragon, the Kaplan turbine is being tested at the Technical University of Munich. This turbine uses a siphon inlet whereas the next 6 turbines to be installed will be equipped with a cylinder gate to start and stop water inlet to the turbine.&lt;ref&gt;Keulenaer, H. http://www.leonardo-energy.org/wave-dragon, 2007-04-13. Retrieved on 2013-01-23:''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

===Construction===
[[Image:WD side princip.JPG|400px|right|Over topping principle of Wave Dragon]]
Wave Dragon uses principles from traditional hydropower plants in an offshore floating platform to use wave energy.

The Wave Dragon consists of two wave reflectors that direct the waves towards a ramp.  Behind the ramp, a large reservoir collects the directed water, and temporarily stores the water. The reservoir is held above sea level. The water leaves the reservoir through hydro turbines.&lt;ref name=WaveDragon&gt;Wave Dragon [http://www.wavedragon.net/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1 ''Wave Dragon Homepage''], Retrieved on 2008-04-10:''&lt;/ref&gt;

Three-step energy conversion:

Overtopping (absorption) -&gt; Storage (reservoir) -&gt; Power-take-off ([[Low head hydro power|low-head turbines]])

Main components of a Wave Dragon:&lt;ref name=WaveDragon/&gt;
*Main body with a double curved ramp (reinforced concrete and/or steel construction)
*Two wave reflectors in reinforced concrete and/or steel
*Mooring system
*Propeller turbines
*Permanent Magnet Generators

===Design===

Wave energy converters make use of the mechanical motion or fluid pressure. Wave Dragon does not have any conversion, e.g. oscillating water/air columns, hinged rafts, and gyroscopic/hydraulic devices. The Wave Dragon directly utilises the energy of the water's motion.

The Wave Dragon is of heavy, durable construction and has only one kind of [[moving parts]]: the turbines. This is essential for any device bound for operations offshore, where extreme conditions and  fouling, etc., seriously affect any moving parts.

Wave Dragon model testing has been used in order to:
*Optimize 'overtopping'
*Refine hydraulic response: anti-pitching and anti-rolling.
*Reduce stress on wave reflectors and the mooring system, etc.
* Reduce construction costs, maintenance and running costs. 

====Main body====
The main body to or platform consists of one large floating reservoir. To reduce rolling and keep the platform stable, the Wave Dragon must be large and heavy.  The prototype used in Nissum is of a traditional (ship-like) plate construction of plates of 8&amp;nbsp;mm steel.&lt;ref name=WaveDragon/&gt; The total steel weight of the main body plus the ramp is 150 tons, so that 87 tons of water must be added to  achieve the 237 tons total weight needed for stable continuous operation.&lt;ref name=WaveDragon/&gt;

[[Image:Peach NE Finished.JPG|thumb|right|A turned wood bowl with natural edges]]
'''Woodturning''' is the craft of using the wood [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]] with hand-held tools to cut a shape that is symmetrical around the axis of rotation.  Like the [[potter's wheel]], the wood lathe is a simple mechanism which can generate a variety of forms. The operator is known as a turner, and the skills needed to use the tools were traditionally known as turnery. In pre-industrial England, these skills were sufficiently difficult to be known as 'the misterie' of the turners guild. The skills to use the tools by hand, without a fixed point of contact with the wood, distinguish woodturning and the wood lathe from the machinists lathe, or [[Turning|metal-working lathe]].

Items made on the lathe include tool handles, candlesticks, egg cups, knobs, lamps, rolling pins, cylindrical boxes, Christmas ornaments, bodkins, knitting needles, needle cases, thimbles, pens, chessmen, spinning tops; legs, spindles and pegs for furniture; balusters and newel posts for architecture; baseball bats, hollow forms such as woodwind musical instruments, urns, sculptures; bowls, platters, and chair seats.  Industrial production has replaced many of these products from the traditional turning shop.  However, the wood lathe is still used for decentralized production of limited or custom turnings. A skilled turner can produce a wide variety of objects with five or six simple tools. The tools can be reshaped easily for the task at hand.  

In many parts of the world, the lathe has been a portable tool that goes to the source of the wood, or adapts to temporary workspaces. 21st-century turners restore furniture, continue folk-art traditions, produce custom architectural work, and create fine craft for galleries.  Woodturning appeals to people who like to work with their hands, find pleasure in problem-solving, or enjoy the tactile and visual qualities of wood.

==Overview==
[[File:Pont-sur-Yonne-FR-89-fête médiévale 2014-15.jpg|thumb|Pole lathe]]
Wood lathes work with either reciprocating or continuous revolution. The reciprocating lathe is powered by a bow or a spring, rotating the wood first in one direction, and then in the other.  The turner cuts on just one side of the rotation, as with the [[pole lathe]]. The reciprocating lathe may be human-powered with a bow, as well as with spring mechanisms.  The reciprocating lathe, while primitive technology requiring considerable dexterity to operate, is capable of excellent results in skilled hands.  For example, reciprocating bow lathes are still used to turn beads for the Arabian lattice windows called [[Mashrabiya|Meshrebeeyeh]] that so charmed [[Holtzapffel]] in the 1880s .{{sfn|Holtzapffel|1976|page=10}}

Continuous revolution of the workpiece can be human-powered with a treadle wheel, or achieved with water, steam, or electric power. The style of cutting does not have the pause required by the reciprocating lathe's rotation.  Even with continuous revolution, however, the turner controls the contact of tool and wood entirely by hand.  The cutters are not fixed, nor advanced automatically, as with the metal-working lathe.

The nature of wood defines woodturning techniques. The orientation of the wood grain, relative to the axis of the lathe, affects the tools and techniques used by the woodturner. In spindle turning, the grain runs lengthwise along the lathe bed, as if a log were mounted in the lathe. Grain is thus always perpendicular to the direction of rotation under the tool. In bowl turning, the grain runs at right angles to the axis, as if a plank were mounted across the chuck. When a bowl blank rotates, the angle that the grain makes with the cutting tool continually changes between the easy cuts to two places per rotation where the tool is cutting across the grain and even upwards across it. This varying grain angle limits some of the tools that may be used and requires additional skill from the turner.

Moisture content affects both the ease of cutting wood and the final shape of the work when it dries. Wetter wood cuts easily with a continuous ribbon of shavings that are relatively dust-free.  However, the wet wood moves as it dries. shrinking less along the grain. These variable changes may add the illusion of an oval bowl, or draw attention to features of the wood.  Dry wood is necessary for turnings that require precision, as in the fit of a lid to a box, or in forms where pieces are glued together.

The character of the wood creates other challenges for the woodturner. Turners of hardwoods and ivory select different tools than those used for cutting softwoods.  Voids in the wood require higher lathe speeds, fillers, or extra safety precautions. Although other woodworkers value tight, straight grain, woodturners often search out the unusual wood from roots, defects, or diseased portions of trees.

The craft of woodturning is preserved and advanced by a community of practitioners. Until the 1970s, an apprentice system in the U.K., and Industrial Arts education in the U.S., preserved many of the traditional skills of the craft. Between 1975 and 1985, industrial arts teachers, hobbyists, artists, collectors, and tool suppliers developed the symposium format for exchange of information about the craft.{{sfnp|Shaw|2016|page=inside cover-first page}} This community was a kind of prototype for the artisan-based [[maker culture]] active in the 21st century. The community organizes regional, national, and international symposiums, publishes journals, and hosts travelling experts at club events. Most publications and DVDs are of the DIY variety, including numerous YouTube videos.

==History==
[[File:BLW The Robert Chalker Mazer, around 1490.jpg|thumb|300px|The "Robert Chalker [[Mazer (drinking vessel)|Mazer]]", Britain 1480-1500, [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].  [[Maple (wood)|Maple]]wood with silver-gilt rim and boss. The boss is engraved with the Trinity, originally enamelled, an unidentified [[merchant's mark]] and the inscription ROBERT CHALKER IESUS.]] 
The archaeological record of woodturning is limited to illustrations because wood is a fiber prone to rot. Egyptian monuments illustrate a strap used by a helper to rotate the lathe while another worker cut the wood.  Early bow lathes and strap lathes were developed and used in Egypt and Rome.{{sfnp|Wood|2005|p=11-12}} The Chinese, Persians, and Arabs had their own variations of the bow lathe.{{sfnp|Holtzapffel|1975|p=5}} Early lathe workers would sometimes use their bare feet to hold cutting tools in place while using their hand to power the lathe.  Bow lathes continue in use right up to the present day, and much of our information about them comes from watching turners use them.{{sfnp|Wood|2005|p=13}}  Between 500 and 1500 A.D., turned wooden vessels served as the everyday bowls and cups of most of the population of Europe. Our knowledge of these humble vessels comes from bowls excavated from shipwrecks, such as the [[Mary Rose]] and the [[Oseberg]] burial ship, or dug out of deep wells, where they were preserved in a nonaerobic environment. Much of this ware was turned from green wood on a spring [[pole lathe]].{{sfnp|Wood|2005|p=59-98}} Finely crafted drinking bowls, known as [[Mazer (drinking vessel)|mazer]]s, were produced in very limited quantities from dry wood, then decorated with [[silver-gilt]] central bosses and rims.{{sfnp|Wood|2005|p=99-110}}

As early as 1568, a separate fly wheel powered a lathe via a drive belt.{{sfnp|Hotlzapffel|1976|p=30}} A master would cut the wood while an apprentice turned the crank on a huge wheel, often several feet in diameter. This was a continuous revolution lathe, which led to adaptation to external power sources such as water, steam, and electricity.  This lathe evolved into the 'queen of machine tools' which made it possible to turn parts for other machinery.{{sfn|Woodbury|1963|p=132-140}}  The [[Holtzapffel]]s developed [[ornamental turning]] lathes from the continuous revolution lathe combined with metal-working innovations like the automatic slide rest.  These lathes worked from geared patterns to cut designs in hardwoods such as [[ebony]].  They were favored as a hobby by European princes, meriting a mention by Tolstoy in War and Peace (1869).{{sfnp|Wood|2005|p=9}}

Woodturners in London organized into a guild as early as 1310 on Wood Street.  By 1347, the Turners Company was  assigned responsibility for regulating weights and measures by the Mayor.{{sfnp|Wood|2005|p=88}} By 1591, they built their own Hall.  The Company governed the apprentice system, and established pricing for goods. In 1604, they were incorporated as the [[Worshipful Company of Turners]] of London.{{sfn|Stanley-Stone|1925}}  Outside of London, the craft was decentralized and unregulated.  Itinerant turners known as [[Bodging|Bodgers]] set up temporary pole lathes near the source of wood for turning furniture parts.
[[File:Bergisch Gladbach - Bergisches Museum - Stellmacherei 02 ies.jpg|thumb|Belt driven lathe]]
[[File:Holzdrechsel.jpg|thumb|Electric lathe]]

In the 19th and early 20th century, woodturners in England worked in Turning Shops,{{sfn|Jones|1996}} usually within the master-apprentice system. In Germany and Russia, woodturning was concentrated in villages which had a specialty, such as turning toys. Bow lathes and pole lathes continued in use for decentralized, one-man production of architectural elements and bowls in many parts of the world.  In the US, woodturning was part of the curriculum of industrial arts taught in public schools—often a prerequisite for classes in building furniture.  The 'problems' from textbooks included both tool management skills, and assignments to turn objects such as gavels, darning eggs, boxes, trays, candlesticks, lamps, and legs for furniture.{{sfn|Crawshaw|1911}}{{sfn|Ensinger|1943}}

Woodturning skills were used by patternmakers in the making of prototypes and shapes for casting molds used in foundries during the 19th and 20th century.  They worked very slowly to achieve precision, using enormous patternmaker lathes and slow-cutting scraping tools.{{sfnp|Ritchey|1942|p.41-42}}

Woodturning has always had a strong hobbyist presence.  In the 1970s, an explosion of interest in hobby woodturning in the English-speaking world sparked a revival in the craft.  Dr. Dale Nish travelled to England to recruit teachers, tools, and techniques from the last of the apprentice-trained woodturners.{{sfn|Nish|1975}}  A few years later, Canadian Stephen Hogbin spent a year in Australia, pushing the limits of the craft through changes in scale and design.{{sfn|Hogbin|1980}}  Industrial arts teachers used their institutional affiliation to create seminars, publish books, and foster research.  The tool industry identified a new market for lathes and turning tools.  A small group of serious collectors invested in the increasingly sculptural explorations of woodturners.  It is unusual that woodturning never established a strong foothold in university departments of art and design.  Instead, practitioners of the craft have become adept at learning from demonstrations, private classes, regional meetings, their own published journals, and internet technologies.  Some artists began as woodturners, and moved into more sculptural work, experimenting with super object forms and other fine craft concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cooke, Jr. |first1=Edward S. |title=Wood Turning in North America Since 1930 |date=2001 |publisher=The Wood Turning Center and Yale University Art Gallery |isbn=0-89467-094-8 |pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for Art in Wood, founded in 1986 as The Wood Turning Center, houses a collection in Philadelphia with over 1,000 objects from international artists &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centerforartinwood.org/collection/|title=A collection of Goblets and Chalices from the Seventeen Peoples of the Eight Inner Worlds - The Center for Art in Wood|website=centerforartinwood.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a research library and gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centerforartinwood.org/about/|title=About - The Center for Art in Wood|website=centerforartinwood.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other turners have chosen an artisan-based focus on traditional work, custom work, and the pleasure of studio practice.

==Techniques==
Complex forms made on a wood lathe develop from surprisingly few types of cuts: parting, planing, bead, cove, and hollowing.  Parting separates the wood from the holding device, or establishes depth cuts.  Planing is done with a tool in which the bevel below the cutting edge supports wood fibers, just as in a typical wood planer.  Beads are a convex shape relative to the cylinder, and coves are a concave shape. Hollowing techniques are a combination of drilling and scooping out materials.  The woodturner is at liberty to choose from a variety of tools for all of these techniques, and the quality of the cuts improves with practice wielding the tool selected.  Turners rely upon three points of contact making any type of cut:  the tool presses down on the tool rest, and against the woodturner's body before contacting the surface of the wood, most often with a bevel edge riding the surface of the wood.  The objective is to position the tool correctly so that the wood comes around to the cutting edge, generating a thin shaving without chipping or tearing out sections of the wood. Woodturners prefer to use very clean cuts to minimize the time spent with abrasives.  When it is necessary to sand the piece, they do so on the lathe, using abrasives held by hand, in an inertial sander which revolves with the wood's own rotation, or with power tools—drills or right-angle drills.  The lathe also becomes a useful holding device for carving, burning, texturing, coloring, and finishing the form.

==Holding devices==
The wood rotates between the headstock of the lathe which includes the drive mechanism and the tailstock support, which only rotates if its center is 'live' or supported by a rotating holding device.  The headstock end may use points or spurs which are driven into the wood. This type of turning is described as 'between centers.'  The headstock spindle may also use a cup, collet, or a scroll chuck to hold a tenon on the workpiece which will be removed in the finished product. The wood can also be screwed or glued to a faceplate—a strong disk that is threaded to mount on the headstock's spindle. The use of a chuck or faceplate allows the woodturner to forego tailstock support for the rotating wood. This type of secure holding system is essential for hollowing bowls or hollow forms.

==Tools==
[[File:Gouges tour à bois.jpg|thumb|left|A basic set of tools for woodturning]]
Turning tools are generally made from three different types of [[steel]]; [[carbon steel]], [[high speed steel]] (HSS), and more recently [[powder metallurgy|powdered metal]]. Comparing the three types, high speed steel tools maintain their edge longer, requiring less frequent sharpening than carbon steel, but not as long as powdered metal tools. The harder the type of high speed steel used, the longer the edge will maintain sharpness. Powdered steel is even harder than HSS, but takes more effort to obtain an edge as sharp as HSS, just as HSS is harder to get as sharp as carbon steel.

Woodturning tools must be sharpened more frequently than other edged [[woodworking|woodworking tools]] to maintain a clean cut because the wood passes at great speed. Sharpening is usually accomplished with the aid of mechanical devices such as powered sharpening wheels and abrasives. This sharpening process requires either skill of the craftsman, or one of the many available sharpening jigs, which facilitate maintaining a specific bevel on the tool. As with any mechanical sharpening method, overheating or blueing is a danger to be avoided as it will ruin the steel's temper, rendering the steel too soft to maintain a sharp edge. When this happens, the blued area must then be ground away to expose fresh steel and the tool must then have the bevel reestablished and the edge re-honed.  High speed steel is not prone to blueing (overheating) whereas carbon steel blues easily, requiring frequent quenching in water or oil to avoid losing temper.
[[File:The Woodwork Lathe * Preparing a wooden blank for turning between centres * Craft &amp; Design Product Design.jpg|thumb|A gouge in use]]

;Types
* roughing gouge - a wide fluted [[Chisel#Gouge|gouge]] used to initially round a wooden spindle, and to roughly shape it. Generally not intended for cutting end grain due to the large cut it takes and the relatively weak tang connecting the blade to the handle. Unsafe for making bowls or any faceplate work.
* spindle gouge or detail gouge - a shallow fluted gouge used to create details on spindles, including beads (raised portions of the turning typically semi-circular in cross section) and coves (relieved portions of the turning).
* bowl gouge - a deep fluted gouge used to turn the outside and inside of bowls and vessels. Often has a thicker shaft and longer handle than a spindle gouge because it has to cut farther away from the tool rest and deal with the forces of turning a large bowl. Sometimes called 'long and strong' gouge.{{sfnp|Child|1997|p=28}}
* skew chisel - a wide, steeply pointed [[chisel]] with the edge running at an angle to the length of the tool. Used to smooth flat spindles, cut beads, and add details. Skew chisels are only used on spindle work (never on faceplate work) and are honed after sharpening to create a razor edge.
* parting tool - a pointed tool used to separate (part off) work from the lathe, and to create a straight edge separating large and small diameter sections - wide parting tools also called bedans are used to create evenly sized spindle sections.
* hollowing tool - many different types of tools used to cut out the deep sections of steep bowls, vases and hollow vessels. Often with very long handles, to maintain enough leverage when working in a deep vessel, far away from the hand rest.
* scraper - a tool that scrapes the wood fibres instead of cutting - these are used to smooth off wooden items cut with other tools, and to shape items that are not possible or difficult to shape with gouges. A sharp scraper has a burr at the edge which cuts the wood, only a dull scraper actually scrapes.
* bowl saver - a tool used to core out the inside part of a bowl, allowing the waste piece to be used to create a smaller bowl, and to limit the amount of wood chips created when hollowing out a bowl.
* auger - a [[drill bit]] used to drill a hole partway or all the way through a wooden item. For cutting the hole for a lamp cord, or as the first step when hollowing out a bowl or vessel
* chatter tool - a flexible scraper used to add decorative chatter marks to turned items
* wire - a simple wire, sometimes with handles attached at either side, for the purpose of burning lines into the piece with [[friction]].
* there are also several tool types for special purposes, as well as tools that are a combination design of the above tools, i.e. skew/chisel combinations, [[screw thread|thread]] cutting tools, ring cutting tools, medium fluted gouges, etc.

==Other techniques==
* Eccentric turning - turning a single piece multiple times, upon different axes each time.
* Oval or elliptical turning - turning a piece using an accessory mounted to the headstock that changes the center of rotation of the piece in time with the rotation, so that a cutting tool held in a fixed position on the tool-rest cuts an oval rather than a round path on the workpiece
* Sculptureturnery – turning on a lathe that will generate turned work that is not necessarily circular, can be any of the following cross –sections; elliptical, triangular, square, pentangle, hexagonal, heptangular.
* Multi-dimensional wood turning - requires that the work piece as it rotates will be able to move cyclically along the lathe bed and/or simultaneously move cyclically across the bed.
* Three dimensional woodturning – is where the shape produced by the lathe is not symmetrical about the axis of rotation.  
* Therming - mounting a carrier between centers, and then mounting the small workpiece(s) to the carrier, so that the axis of the headstock/tail-stock does not pass through any of the workpieces, and each workpiece gets cut only on one face. As noted in ''Wood-turning Methods'' by Mike Darlow, the etymology of the term "therming" comes via a corruption of the name of the Greek god [[Hermes]], who was often represented as a statue set atop a plinth with a construction characteristic of thermed work.
* [[Segmented turning]] - a method of woodturning where the wood blank is constructed from many individual pieces of wood (segments) which are glued together before being turned. Many interesting patterns can be generated through the process of gluing and shaping on the lathe.
* Green or wet turning - turning wood while its moisture content is above equilibrium. Often done when the wood is newly felled. May be turned to finished thickness, in which case the differential shrinkage of the wood will result in a finished piece that is not perfectly round. Alternatively, it may be "rough turned". Rough turning involves turning the piece only to its general shape, leaving enough thickness so that after turning it can be allowed to dry to equilibrium moisture content and distort. The advantage over first drying the wood then turning is that a rough turned piece dries faster, will probably distort instead of split as solid wood tends to, and that wet wood turns better, since it creates less dust. Rough turning is inexact science: turning wood too thick will lead to splits, turning wood too thin will lead to distortion that cannot be removed, because not enough thickness is left. Once dry, it is mounted on the lathe a second time and turned to its final form. Rough turning is typically used on most functional work and some artistic pieces.
* Natural edge work - pieces which include the outside of the tree trunk or limb as the edge of the piece. Typically artistic turnings, usually bowls or hollow vessels, and usually green turned to final dimension. May include the bark or not, but pieces with bark should not have any bark damaged or missing.
* Ornamental turning - also known as OT, a method in which the piece is mounted upon a rocking headstock, and a spinning tool is used to cut out exotic and decorative patterns. The device is called a rose engine lathe
*Twistwork - A type of carving on spindles or vessels, in which the lathe is a holding device and the turner makes spiral cuts. The turner may use a grid drawn on the wood, or cut entirely by eye, using either hand tools, power tools, or abrasives.

==Safety==
When woodturning, it is important to wear certain [[protective clothing|personal protective equipment]] (PPE). Loose clothing should not be worn, all jewellery should be removed, and long hair should be tied back. Wood shavings generated during turning will also need to be periodically removed.
* '''Eye protection''' is a necessity when woodturning. There are several PPE available for eye protection such as safety [[goggles]], glasses and [[visor]]s, some of which feature built-in [[respirator]]s. Although all of these are adequate, for the highest level of protection, a visor that protects the entire head from dust and debris should be worn.
* '''Respiratory equipment''' and [[dust collection system]]s are also important when woodturning or doing any type of woodworking that creates dust. This can range from a simple disposable dust mask, to a full face helmet with built in respirator. Most stand alone respiratory equipment will interfere with dust shields and visors, so devices that incorporate both are available. Many woods create dust that is actually a health hazard. For example, [[cocobolo]] (granadillo) dust is known to be toxic ([[toxic shock]]). Many people are sensitive to oils carried in [[walnut]], [[Robinia pseudoacacia|locust]], and [[oak]] sawdust.  Long term exposure to fine wood dust has also been linked with an increased risk of developing cancer.
* '''Ear protection''' - Compared to other power tools, a lathe is a quiet machine. [[earplug|Ear protection]] should be used if [[industrial noise|noise]] is excessive, this may be due to motor (fan) noise from a shop dust collector, or the combination of wood and tool being used.
* '''Hand/skin protection''' - Gloves should not be used with rotating equipment, since there's always a risk of getting tangled in the machine. Nevertheless, some woods provide splinters that not only puncture skin, but also cause festering sores and/or skin irritation. Polishes and finishes used in woodturning can also be harmful or irritant to skin, often containing [[organic solvent]]s such as [[methanol]], [[turpentine]] and [[toluene]].  This subject continues to be debated in the community.
* '''Foot protection''' - Protective footwear, often [[leather]] [[steel-toe boots]], is required for any type of shop activity.

A good way to check the safety before starting the lathe is 'SAFER':

*S - Speed - check the rpm speed, slower for big, heavy things, faster for smaller lighter things. Most authors recommend always starting at slow speeds and re-setting speed to low at end of session.
*A - Aside - make sure you are standing to the side of the blank's 'firing line' (not in front of the wood).
*F - Fixings - check that the wood, tool-rest, tail-stock etc. are correctly attached.
*E - Eye protection - make sure you're wearing sufficient eye protection.
*R - Revolve - Check that the wood can turn around without encountering any obstructions, such as the tool rest, by rotating it by hand.

Safe usage of a lathe also depends on the operator's choice of proper techniques for the lathe, tools, and wood.  For example, using a high spindle speed with an unbalanced wooden blank may cause the lathe to vibrate dangerously.  Spinning a large turning blank too fast may cause it to explode.  Inappropriate use of tools such as gouges and skew chisels can cause a ''catch'', where the tool bites suddenly and aggressively into the wood in an uncontrolled manner.  This exerts very large forces on the wood, the tool, the lathe and the operator, often causing the wood to break apart or tear free from the lathe. Lathe accidents often pull the tool out of the operator's hand and throw them in unexpected directions.  Particular care is also required for wooden shapes that are not circular, such as off-center work, or bowls with wings or square rims.  Portions of the turning extend farther from the axis of rotation, and are sometimes more difficult to see than the bulk of the wooden blank.
