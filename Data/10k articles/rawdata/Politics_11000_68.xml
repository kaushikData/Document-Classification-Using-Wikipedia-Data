The '''6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles''' was a [[rifle regiment]] of the [[British Indian Army]] comprising [[Gurkha]] soldiers of [[Nepal]]ese origin, before being transferred to the [[British Army]] following India's independence. Originally raised in 1817 as part of the army of the British [[East India Company]], the regiment has been known by a number of names throughout its history. Initially the unit did not recruit from the [[Gurkha]]s, although after being transferred to the British Indian Army following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], it became a purely Gurkha regiment, in due course with its regimental headquarters at [[Abbottabad]] in the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North West Frontier Province]] of [[British India]]. After 1947 the regiment was one of only four Gurkha regiments to be transferred to the British Army and this continued up until 1994, when it was amalgamated with other Gurkha regiments to form the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]]. Over the course of its 177-year history, the regiment was awarded 25 battle honours, although prior to [[World War I]] it had only been awarded one and no battle honours were awarded to it after [[World War II]].

==History==

===Beginnings===
[[File:42nd Gurkha Light Infantry, later 6th Gurkha Rifles, c. 1890.jpg|thumb|left|42nd Gurkha Light Infantry, c. 1890]]

The regiment was initially raised in 1817 as the '''Cuttack Legion''' as part of the army of the East India Company.&lt;ref name=6thgrorg&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the 6th Gurkhas |url=http://www.6thgurkhas.org/theregiment_history.shtml |publisher=6th Gurkhas.org |accessdate=2009-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829045842/http://www.6thgurkhas.org/theregiment_history.shtml |archivedate=2008-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a unit of Indian natives from the Cuttack City of [[Odisha]] area and initially it was used to maintain order in the region, before moving to Northern [[Bengal]] in 1823 when it became known as the '''Rungpoor Light Infantry'''.

During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] the regiment remained "loyal" to the British and two of its members were awarded with [[Indian Order of Merit]],&lt;ref name=6thgrorg/&gt; which was the highest award that a Gurkha could receive until 1911 when Gurkhas became eligible for the Victoria Cross.&lt;ref&gt;Parker 2005, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Following this, the regiment was transferred to the newly formed [[British Indian Army]] and as time passed, the regiment began recruiting [[Nepal]]ese [[Gurkhas]] into its ranks—initially only two [[company (military unit)|companies]] of Gurkhas were formed, but, over time, more and more were recruited until it eventually became a pure Gurkha regiment, being numbered as the '''42nd Regiment of Goorkha Light Infantry''' in 1886.&lt;ref name=lineage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.6thgurkhas.org/theregiment_titles.shtml|title=6th Gurkha's Regimental Titles|publisher=6th Gurkhas.org|accessdate=2009-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724211116/http://www.6thgurkhas.org/theregiment_titles.shtml|archive-date=2011-07-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the period before the [[First World War]], the regiment was primarily involved in patrolling the north-east border of [[India]], indeed it remained in eastern India for 77 years, and as such the regiment gained only a single [[battle honour]] up to 1914.&lt;ref name=6thgrorg/&gt;

In 1899 the regiment moved from Assam to [[Abbottabad]], in present-day Pakistan, and began operations on the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North-West Frontier]].&lt;ref name=6thgrorg/&gt; In 1903, the regiment was also renumbered as the 6th Gurkha Rifles.&lt;ref&gt;Parker 2005, pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, a second battalion for the regiment was raised from a cadre taken from the 1st Battalion.&lt;ref name=6thgrorg/&gt;

===First World War===
[[Image:KhanBaghdadi.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The 2nd Battalion, 6th Gurkha Rifles of [[42nd Indian Brigade]] march towards the [[Action of Khan Baghdadi]]]]
During the First World War the regiment was expanded further with the raising of a third battalion.&lt;ref name=6thgrorg/&gt; The regiment served in a number of theatres during the war, including Persia, the Middle East, Turkey and Greece.&lt;ref name=6thgrorg/&gt;

The 1st Battalion had the distinction of being the first Gurkha unit to arrive at [[Gallipoli]] landing at Cape Helles on 25 April 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Parker 2005, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Their first major operation saw them attack an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] position that was doing significant damage to Allied forces with [[machine guns]]—this involved them going up a 300-foot (91 metre) vertical slope which had defeated both the [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine Light Infantry]] and the [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]]—however, the Gurkhas gained the position with ease.&lt;ref&gt;Parker 2005, pp. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteen Gurkhas were killed in this action and another forty-two were wounded. For their sacrifice, this area is now known as ''Gurkha Bluff''.&lt;ref&gt;Parker 2005, pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The 2nd Battalion meanwhile began service with the [[2nd (Rawalpindi) Division]]&lt;ref name=Perry42&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 1916 transferred to the new [[15th Indian Division]] where it served the remainder of the war in [[Mesopotamian Campaign|Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name=Perry134&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd Battalion was formed as the ''3rd Gurkha Reserve Battalion'' on 5 February 1917&lt;ref name=Perry177&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Rawalpindi]].&lt;ref name=Perry43&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1918, it was transferred to the [[Bannu Brigade]] on the North East Frontier.&lt;ref name=Perry154&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the brigade, it served in the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] in 1919.&lt;ref name=Perry156&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was disbanded on 1 February 1921.&lt;ref name=Gaylor235&gt;{{harvnb|Gaylor|1996|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-war years===
Between the First and Second World Wars the regiment was reduced to two battalions once more and they returned to the North-West Frontier where they were employed on garrison duties.&lt;ref name=6thgrorg/&gt;

===Second World War===
The Second World War saw the expansion of all ten Gurkha regiments of the British Indian Army, and the 6th Gurkhas raised a further two battalions, numbered as the 3rd and 4th Battalions.&lt;ref&gt;Cross &amp; Gurung 2002, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the conflict, battalions of the regiment fought in [[Italy]] and [[Burma]], and also in [[Waziristan]] on the North West Frontier (1940–41) where they served as garrison troops and saw action against [[Pashtun people|Pathan]] tribesmen.&lt;ref name=6thgrorg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cross &amp; Gurung 2002, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The British Army in Burma 1945 SE1934.jpg|thumb|left|Men of the 6th Gurkha Rifles go into action at Singu on the Irrawaddy bridgehead with [[Stuart tank]]s in support, February 1945.]]

In January 1943 the 2nd Battalion was attached to the [[3rd Indian Motor Brigade]] which had just returned from the Western Desert after having been almost destroyed at the [[Battle of Gazala]].&lt;ref name=Rothwell&gt;{{cite web|title=rothwell|url=http://www.rothwell.force9.co.uk/NA150541.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the month the brigade was renamed as the [[43rd Indian Infantry Brigade (Lorried)]]. The brigade and its Gurkha battalions were sent to [[Italy]] in mid-1944 as an Independent brigade and fought in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]].&lt;ref name=Chappell58&gt;Chappell 1993, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the [[Burma Campaign]], that the regiment received its first [[Victoria Cross]], in fact two awards were made to members of the regiment for actions on the same day. Captain [[Michael Allmand]] and Rifleman [[Tulbahadur Pun]]&lt;ref name=6thgurkhasvc&gt;{{cite web|title=6th Gurkha's Victoria Crosses|url=http://www.6thgurkhas.org/theregiment_vc.shtml|publisher=6th Gurkhas.org|accessdate=2009-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011131906/http://www.6thgurkhas.org/theregiment_vc.shtml|archive-date=2008-10-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were awarded the VC for their actions during the fighting around the Pin Hmi Road Bridge at [[Mogaung]] in Burma on 23 June 1944 while serving with the 3rd Battalion&lt;ref&gt;Referred to as the 3/6th.&lt;/ref&gt; who were taking part [[Operation Thursday]], which was the second Chindit expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Parker 2005, pp. 193–198.&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd Battalion's involvement in this operation proved very costly and they suffered 126 killed, 352 wounded and 7 missing.&lt;ref&gt;These casualties were broken down as follows: British officers—11 killed and 9 wounded; Gurkha officers—6 killed, 8 wounded and Gurkha other ranks—109 killed, 335 wounded and 7 missing.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as the two previously mentioned VCs, members of the battalion also received the following awards: 2 [[Distinguished Service Order|DSOs]], 3 IOMs, 6 [[Military Cross|MCs]], 4 [[Indian Distinguished Service Medal|IDSMs]], 12 [[Military Medal|MMs]], 3 [[Silver Star|US Silver Stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.6thgurkhas.org/theregiment_battles.shtml|title=The Battle for Mogaung|publisher=6th Gurkhas.org|accessdate=2009-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827235622/http://www.6thgurkhas.org/theregiment_battles.shtml|archive-date=2008-08-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post 1947===
In 1946 the regiment was reduced to three battalions, following the disbandment of the 4th Battalion. A year later, India gained its independence and under the 1947 [[Britain–India–Nepal Tripartite Agreement|Tri Partite Agreement]] four regiments of the Brigade of Gurkhas were allocated to the [[British Army]], while the other six were transferred to the newly formed independent [[Indian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Parker 2005, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; The 6th Gurkhas were one of the regiments that were transferred to the British Army, although the 3rd Battalion was transferred to the [[5th Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]], which was one of the battalions that had been allocated to the Indian Army, and the regiment was thus reduced to two battalions once more.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} In 1959, the regiment was renamed as the 6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles in honour of [[Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref name=6thgrorg/&gt;

As with other Gurkha regiments, the 6th Gurkhas primarily saw service in the Far East until the British withdrawal from East of Suez. Both battalions participated in the [[Malayan Emergency]].&lt;ref name=6thgrorg/&gt; Later, between 1962 and 1964, the 1st Battalion served in the United Kingdom. Between 1963 and 1966, both the 1st and 2nd Battalions saw service in Borneo during [[Indonesian Confrontation|Confrontation]].&lt;ref name=6thgrorg/&gt;

On 16 June 1969, the 6th Gurkhas was reduced to a single [[battalion]], when the 1st and 2nd Battalions were amalgamated as the 1st Battalion.&lt;ref name=6thgrorg/&gt; The single battalion continued to rotate with the other Gurkha regiments between [[Hong Kong]], [[Brunei]] and [[Church Crookham]] until 1 July 1994. At that point, while in Hong Kong, the 1st Battalion was amalgamated with the 1st Battalion, [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)]] to form the 1st Battalion, [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]].&lt;ref name=Parker387&gt;Parker 2005, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victoria Cross recipients==
There have been two [[Victoria Cross]] recipients from the 6th Gurkhas. These were:

* Lieutenant (acting Captain) [[Michael Allmand]], [[6th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers (Watson's Horse)]] attached to the 3rd Battalion, 6th Gurkha Rifles, 23 June 1944, Burma (posthumous); and
* Rifleman [[Tulbahadur Pun]], 3rd Battalion, 23 June 1944, Burma.&lt;ref name=Parker393&gt;Parker 2005, p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
) is an Argentina-born feminist and anti-trafficking activist. After a police raid at the brothel where she was being sexually exploited in 2012, she began advocating for the abolition of prostitution. She attracted media attention in Argentina when she sued her exploiters and the city where the brothel was located. She became known worldwide when the U.S. Department of State gave her an award for her anti-trafficking activism.

== Childhood and family ==
Kinan's family had enough money to provide her a good education, but her life began to spiral downhill when her father began to abuse her mother. Kinan has said that her mother, along with her grandmother and her aunts, were prostituted.&lt;ref name="historia"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.laretaguardia.com.ar/2015/03/la-historia-de-alika-kinan-del-trabajo.html | dead-url=no | title=La historia de Alika Kinán, del trabajo sexual a la trata en primera persona | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731230249/http://www.laretaguardia.com.ar/2015/03/la-historia-de-alika-kinan-del-trabajo.html | archive-date=2017-07-31 | date=2015-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has described how her father used to tell stories after dinner about how he met her mother and how he rescued her from the ''zulo''.&lt;ref name="desprender"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.marcha.org.ar/alika-kinan-estoy-tratando-de-desprenderme-del-lugar-de-victima-es-todo-un-proceso/ | title=Alika Kinan: "Estoy tratando de desprenderme del lugar de víctima. Es todo un proceso" | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620210439/http://www.marcha.org.ar/alika-kinan-estoy-tratando-de-desprenderme-del-lugar-de-victima-es-todo-un-proceso | dead-url=no | archive-date=2017-06-20 | date=2015-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Zulo'' is a word with many meanings. In this context, it could mean either a small, wretched apartment, or a brothel.) Kinan was raped at age fourteen. Her parents separated when she was fifteen and her younger sister was nine, and her father stopped supporting the family.&lt;ref name="esclava"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/esclava-sexual-justicia-alika_0_1346265427.html/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428174854/http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/esclava-sexual-justicia-alika_0_1346265427.html | dead-url=no | date=2015-04-26 | title=Fui una esclava sexual durante 20 años y ahora busco justicia | archive-date=2015-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abandoned by parents, enters sex work ==
A year later Kinan's mother went to [[Buenos Aires]], leaving her to care for her sister.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; (According to some sources, Kinan's mother took Kinan and her sister to [[Buenos Aires]] and Kinan later returned to [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].&lt;ref name="incomoda"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://revistaharoldo.com.ar/nota.php?id=180 | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-15 | title=Las incómodas verdades de Alika Kinan | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802204533/http://revistaharoldo.com.ar/nota.php?id=180  | archive-date=2017-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Kinan tried cooking and selling a local pastry but couldn't earn enough to support herself and her sister. Her father refused to help her.&lt;ref name="esclava" /&gt; Reportedly, he told her "You know what you have to do," implying that she should become a prostitute.&lt;ref name="incomoda" /&gt; She worked for someone for three months but received no pay. A friend suggested working at Aries, a brothel run out of a private apartment.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt;

Kinan remembers her decision to enter sex work:

{{quote |text=My grandmother was a prostitute, my mom and my aunts too, it's like being in that situation seems natural. When my mom leaves I'm left in charge of my sister, who is a lot younger than me. There came a time when we did not have anything to eat, we had nowhere to live, it was an extreme situation, I was left with a small child and I was facing that situation. It was then that a girl makes me an offer in a place X, and tells me that we could go to a private apartment where they were hosting bachelor parties, it was like a massage place, it all seemed very strange. At that time I did not go, until the situation was so extreme that I was up to my neck and one day I found myself ringing the bell at the place that had been pointed out to me.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

Kinan was seventeen at the time.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; She remembers her first client as being grotesquely fat and smelling like talcum powder.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; She still remembers the odor:

{{quote |text=on the subject of the massages, there are those strange scents that stay with you for life. It's very disgusting. It's those memories that you try to bury under everything else.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

After that, she worked at bachelor parties and continued seeing individual clients. She received 40% of the clients' fees, which was enough to rent a place for her and her sister.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; While still underage, she attracted the attention of the police and spent more time hiding from them than servicing clients,&lt;ref name="aislada"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://cosecharoja.org/alika-kinan-amenazas | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-04 | title=Alika Kinan esta aislada y declarara en Camara Gesell | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428184203/http://cosecharoja.org/alika-kinan-amenazas | archive-date=2017-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which would have reduced the amount of money she could earn to support herself and her sister. She says

{{quote |text=... when I was younger, I tried to avoid the police because there was a follow-up, a payment of fines, but I was still underage and if the police caught me it would be worse.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

At one point during this period, Kinan seems to have also been supporting her father. She says that he lived with her and asked her for money. He also threatened to get a lawyer and take her younger sister away from her.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt;

== Ushuaia ==
Up to this time, Kinan had been moving back and forth between [[Cruz del Eje]] and the city of [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; Another woman recommended that she move to [[Ushuaia]], in [[Argentina]]'s [[Tierra del Fuego]] region.&lt;ref name="marea"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/las12/13-9654-2015-04-24.html | dead-url=no | date=2015-04-24 | title=Contra viento y marea | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608172723/https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/las12/13-9654-2015-04-24.html | archive-date=2016-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinan was told that she would get many clients who paid well in dollars, and she could keep 50% of the clients fees, as opposed to the 40% that she kept in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].

{{ quote | text=She said to me "I was in the south, you earn very good money, there are fishing boats, many foreigners, you can charge in dollars, you earn double because you are paid best."  ... they gave you 40%, and so I went to Ushuaia where they did not deduct so much.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

Different sources report her age at this time as fifteen,&lt;ref name="distinguida"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://noticias.unsam.edu.ar/2017/07/05/alika-kinan-distinguida-heroina-en-estados-unidos-por-su-lucha-contra-la-trata | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-03 | title=Alika Kinan, distinguida "Heroína" en Estados Unidos por su lucha contra la trata | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805105401/http://noticias.unsam.edu.ar/2017/07/05/alika-kinan-distinguida-heroina-en-estados-unidos-por-su-lucha-contra-la-trata | archive-date=2017-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; eighteen,&lt;ref name="honoree"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/29/534709918/state-department-honoree-was-trapped-in-a-brothel-for-nearly-20-years | dead-url=no | date=2017-06-29 | title=State Department Honoree Was Trapped In A Brothel For Nearly 20 Years | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703221203/http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/29/534709918/state-department-honoree-was-trapped-in-a-brothel-for-nearly-20-years | archive-date=2017-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; nineteen&lt;ref name="sobrevivio"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cba24n.com.ar/content/sobrevivio-la-trata-y-es-querellante-contra-sus-proxenetas |dead-url=no | date=2016-11-10| title=Sobrevivió a la trata y es querellante contra sus proxenetas | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114132159/http://www.cba24n.com.ar/content/sobrevivio-la-trata-y-es-querellante-contra-sus-proxenetas | archive-date=2016-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or twenty.&lt;ref name="incomoda" /&gt; She was born in 1976&lt;ref name="calvario"/&gt; and went to [[Ushuaia]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; If she arrived before her birthday on 24 June, she would have been nineteen. If she arrived after her birthday, she would have been twenty. But in either case she was likely to be closer to her twentieth birthday than her nineteenth. A plane ticket was sent to her and in [[Ushuaia]] she began work at a nightclub called Sheik where, as promised, she kept 50% of the clients' fees. After a while she rented a place and sent for her sister, paying for her school, English classes, computers, clothing, and food.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt;

(Various sources give the name of the nightclub as "El Sheikh", "El Sheik", "Sheikh", and "Sheik". Photographs of the nightclub show a sign saying "Sheik", so that is the name used in this article.)

== Marriage ==
According to Kinan's ex-husband, Miguel Pascual, they met in 1996, the same year she arrived in [[Ushuaia]]. She had already changed employers and was working at the nightclub Black &amp; White.&lt;ref name="sola"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.enperspectiva.com.ar/alika-no-esta-sola-comienza-el-juicio-en-tierra-del-fuego | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-04 | title=Alika no está sola: comienza el juicio en Tierra del Fuego | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109001257/https://www.enperspectiva.com.ar/alika-no-esta-sola-comienza-el-juicio-en-tierra-del-fuego | archive-date=2016-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He paid her managers extra to spend extra time with her, but she wasn't informed&lt;ref name="denouncer"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thedawn-news.org/2016/11/15/argentina-alika-kinan-from-victim-to-denouncer-of-a-trafficking-network | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-03 | title=Argentina: Alika Kinan, from victim to denouncer of a trafficking network | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729225407/http://www.thedawn-news.org/2016/11/15/argentina-alika-kinan-from-victim-to-denouncer-of-a-trafficking-network | archive-date=2017-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as she comments, "... obviously I did not see any of it."&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; Pascual served three yearlong tours of duty on a ship that supplied [[Spain]]'s Antarctic bases. He and Kinan saw each other during those three years when his boat docked in [[Ushuaia]].&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt; He told her he wanted her to be his life partner.&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt; Kinan was apparently in danger at the time:

{{quote |text=People from Rio Grande had come looking for me with guns, I went with a boy a little bigger than I, who suggested that I go on vacation with him, he was very insistent and the truth that I had to run from here because at any moment some pimp with guns was going to create a bad situation ...&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

In a different interview, she didn't mention the pimps with guns, but she indicated a similar degree of desperation:

{{ quote | text=The point is that this guy left a lot of money every time he came, always paid in dollars - it's the time of 1 to 1 [The Argentine peso was pegged to the U.S. dollar at one to one.] and I said that in order to leave that place I was going wherever he went. I was not in love. I submitted.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

So he took her on vacation in [[Barcelona]] where his family had businesses and drove Mercedes, and she ended up staying with him in Spain and bringing her sister over.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt;

In Kinan's description of the marriage, she worked at businesses owned by her husband's family. One source says that he collected half her wages,&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; another says that he collected all of her wages.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; She wasn't allowed to use the car and was required to function as the maid. To support her sister, she secretly sold her eggs. (It must have been extremely difficult to hide this from her husband without a car.&lt;ref name="eggDonation"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_donation#The_egg_donor.27s_process_in_detail | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-01 | title=Egg donation - Wikipedia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127132005/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_donation | archive-date=2017-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) She says her husband quickly became violent.

{{ quote | text=... I was faced with a violent guy, a family where violence was naturalized. I remember that the first time he hit me was the few months I went with him, and the first thing I did was tell the mother, because he had smashed the remote control in my face, and she asked me "but what did you do?" Then I realized I was to the oven. [An Argentine idiom indicating being in a bad situation from which there is no escape.]&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

A few days before the start of the trial, Pascual gave a very different description of their marriage, which he described as "hell from the first day." He claims that it was she who assaulted him, and that he defended himself without hitting her.

{{ quote | text=She tried to hit me two times, I am a master of martial arts, and both times I took her by the hair and back, and I put her on her knees ... Both times I immobilized her when she tried to hit me, but she never hit me.&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt; }}

Kinan says that at some point after the birth of their second child, her husband sent her to a brothel.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; Her husband denies the accusations of forced labor and forced prostitution.

{{ quote | text=At no time was she forced. She worked in Spain with my brother in a transport company. She has lied about me, about my mother saying that she forced her to work.

[The eldest daughter] was in Buenos Aires saying that her mother had been mistreated and forced into prostitution in Spain, and that never happened. I can give names of the companies in which she worked and I have a thousand witnesses.&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt; }}

Over nine years they had three children. According to Kinan, one night when the oldest was eight, she refused to do her homework and her father hit her hard enough to cause bleeding. Kinan decided that she needed to leave [[Spain]] and persuaded her husband to take them all back to [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; According to her husband, Miguel Pascual, they moved to [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] in [[Argentina]] in 2008, and separated in 2010. At that point he returned to Spain&lt;ref name="redito"&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://cronicasfueguinas.blogspot.com/2016/11/alika-usa-mis-hijas-para-sacar-redito.html | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-02 | title=Alika usa mis hijas para sacar redito economico | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106142803/http://cronicasfueguinas.blogspot.com/2016/11/alika-usa-mis-hijas-para-sacar-redito.html | archive-date=2016-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kinan returned to [[Ushuaia]] and Sheik to support herself and her children.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt;

As with Kinan, there are some discrepancies in different versions of Pascual's story. At one point he said that he and Kinan separated, and he continued sending money for their daughters until he discovered that she had returned to sex work.&lt;ref name="redito"/&gt; In another account he claimed to be present when she made the phone call to Sheik to ask about returning to sex work. In this telling, they separated because she was returning to sex work, and he later stopped sending money because she married another man whom she was supporting.&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt;

== Brothel work ==
Following the police raid at the Black &amp; White nightclub/brothel, news outlets published information about the brothel's operations. Much of this information relates to aspects of brothel operation that aren't described in news reports describing Sheik. Kinan worked at Black &amp; White immediately before leaving for [[Spain]]. This section uses information about both Sheik and Black &amp; White to give a more complete picture of the working conditions that Kinan would have encountered.

Alika Kinan's experience at the two brothels were probably common for sex workers across the southern Cone area. Descriptions of brothels in two Chilean cities not far from [[Ushuaia]] and in [[Ushuaia]] itself closely match the business operations of Sheik and Black &amp; White.&lt;ref name="otherMenus"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.erraticrock.com/information/information-articles-1/just-exploring-other-menus | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-16 | title=Just Exploring Other Menus |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729110434/http://www.erraticrock.com/information/information-articles-1/just-exploring-other-menus |archive-date=2017-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information and employees seem to have moved more or less freely between the six brothels of [[Ushuaia]], which were located within a few blocks of each other.&lt;ref name="commercialized"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.patagonia-argentina.com/en/commercialized-sexual-activity | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-19 | title=Commercialized sexual activity  | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708233852/http://www.patagonia-argentina.com/en/commercialized-sexual-activity | archive-date=2017-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When many of [[Ushuaia]]'s sex workers migrated to [[Punto Arenas]] in [[Chile]] after the police raids shut down the brothels in [[Ushuaia]],&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt; it was a one-time group migration, but it probably followed a path previously forged by individual sex workers moving between the two cities. No two businesses operate in exactly the same way, but these two brothels can be taken as a rough proxy for legally regulated brothels in [[Patagonia]].

=== Management ===
==== Sheik ====
The primary manager at Sheik was Pedro Montoya, who was involved with the brothel throughout its existence. During an earlier period, his co-manager was his wife Claudia Quiroga, who owned the property where the brothel was located. The on-site supervisor under Quiroga was Corina Sánchez.

At the time of the police raid, Quiroga and Sánchez were no longer involved. The co-manager was Montoya's girlfriend Ivana Claudia García, and the on-site supervisor was Lucy Alberca Campos. García's brother Jorge Etcheverry worked as a recruiter for the brothel.

During the trial, Kinan described how the managers used surveillance cameras to monitor the women:

{{ quote | They ordered us where to position ourselves, how we should sit, because Claudia operated the cameras wherever you were. When the phone rang you knew it was Claudia who was watching who was coming in, who had to get on the phone, if you were standing, if you had gone to the bathroom a lot, because they monitored even the times you went to the bathroom. Everything was monitored.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; }}

One woman was described by the managers as "like the fish, you use everything but the head."&lt;ref name="chicas"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/chicas-vulnerables-victimas-negocio-ushuaia_0_Hy5W6y-bl.html | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-09 | title=Chicas pobres y vulnerables, las víctimas del negocio de la trata en Ushuaia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729214706/https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/chicas-vulnerables-victimas-negocio-ushuaia_0_Hy5W6y-bl.html | archive-date=2017-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Equivalent to the American expression "butterface" or the Australian expression "prawn.") This was cited at the trial as an example of the managers' contempt toward the women.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; At the trial, one of the police witnesses said that the managers mislead the women in order to recruit them, and then belittled them for their poverty and poor education.&lt;ref name="finalizo"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://banderafueguina.com.ar/noticia/1402/finalizo-la-tercera-jornada-de-juicio-con-la-declaracion-de-una-de-las-mujeres-r | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-10 | title=Finalizó la tercera jornada de juicio con la declaración de una de las mujeres rescatadas del Sheik | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803130104/http://banderafueguina.com.ar/noticia/1402/finalizo-la-tercera-jornada-de-juicio-con-la-declaracion-de-una-de-las-mujeres-r | archive-date=2017-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinan remembers the following scene:

{{ quote | text=Even the female owner, the girlfriend of the trafficker always told me that she was going to teach me how to work, then she would knock me against the bar and say "give it to me, baby, bring me money, give it to me" and hit the bar hard. I remember that I jumped a few leaps ...&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

On the other hand, Kinan felt that the managers were

{{ quote | text=The family I had never had, the one that never cared for me, I said that they took care of me, gave me housing. That's why I made the decision to return. I thought that corresponded because I had to be working and these people gave me housing, they cared for me, because if something happened, I cut a finger or had to go to the doctor they accompanied me ... they took care that I did not spread disease, that I did not catch any infection, I did not catch the flu. When the snowy season began, they would tell me to go get the vaccine or take something so I would not get sick.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

As Kinan points out, it was good business to keep workers healthy and productive. The feeling that the managers were her family is not surprising, given that between the age of sixteen, when she was left to support herself and her sister, and the age of thirty six, when the police raided Sheik, the brothels of [[Ushuaia]] and her husband were the only ones who concerned themselves about her health, housing, and financial support.

==== Black &amp; White ====
The primary manager at Black &amp; White was Victor Morales, nicknamed "Jefe". His daughter seems to have been second in command. Other people involved in some sort of managerial capacity included his ex-wife, his current girlfriend, and his son.
&lt;ref name="clanMorales"&gt;
{{cite news

| archive-date= 2015-12-28 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Sheik, Black and White had security cameras. One woman was so unnerved by their presence that she left shortly after arrival.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

=== Workers ===
==== Sheik ====

==== Black &amp; White ====
Black &amp; White's web site promised twenty-five women. During the police investigation the number of women employed varied from twelve to twenty. At the time of the raid it employed eighteen women. The majority of them were from the Dominican Republic,

Most of them were in their twenties. A woman who was thirty eight said that Morales was initially reluctant to hire her because of her age.

Among the women who were described, one had left home and was struggling to support herself, one had debts, and two had been doing sex work in [[Rosario, Santa Fe]] and came to [[Ushuaia]] for the job. One of the women was mentally ill and her condition prompted the police to end the investigation and raid the brothel.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

One of the women interviewed by the prosecutors during the Black &amp; White investigation testified that she had been seventeen years old when Morales recruited her. She said that he brought her to [[Ushuaia]] along with two other underage girls. When they arrived at the house they would live in, they found other employees of the brothel who were also underage.

=== Government involvement in the brothels ===
When a sex worker first arrived at [[Ushuaia]], she would first be taken to the police station where the provincial police would take her finger prints,

open a file on her, and ensure that she had no criminal record.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; The city government then set up a health book that recorded her medical examinations.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; The city of [[Ushuaia]] required the women to undergo regular examinations, involving tests for HIV and [[sexually transmitted infection]]s and analysis of vaginal discharges.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt; There were no examinations at Sheik during the period of police surveillance. The women were probably relieved; a witness at the trial testified that the inspectors mocked and humiliated the women they were examining.&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt; The owner of Sheik testified during the trial that there were two to three inspections per month,&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; and listed inspections to confirm that the business permits were in order, that there was a fire extinguisher, and that the entertainers had their sanitary pads.
&lt;ref name="socio"&gt;

The city continued the police registration and medical inspections of women in the local brothels after the time Argentina's anti-trafficking law was passed in 2008 (see the article [[Human trafficking in Argentina]]) until the first brothel raids in 2012. In addition, one source says that the city charged for inspections and the renewal of a woman's health book,&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt; which occurred quarterly.&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt;

This matches a historical pattern in [[Argentina]]'s [[Patagonia]] region. Municipal governments, strongly influenced by local businessmen, wanted to use their powers of regulation to maintain their tax bases and were opposed to too much interference in the brothel business. The provincial police had other funding sources and wanted to restrict brothel activities in unprofitable ways. The municipal government of Rio Gallegos was founded in 1912, and by 1914 there was already conflict between the city and the police of Santa Cruz province over the regulation of brothels.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[Ushuaia]], the conflict was between the municipal government and the federal justice system. About the same time as the police raid on Sheik, the city council of [[Ushuaia]] was advised that it should pass a law closing the remaining nightclubs.

=== Recruitment ===
==== Sheik ====
None of the women working at Sheik were from [[Ushuaia]]. Some came from elsewhere in Argentina and some came from other countries.&lt;ref name="dia03"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lasrojas.com.ar/juicio-de-alika-dia-3 | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-09 | title=Juicio de Alika.

Pedro Montoya, the owner, testified that all the women came from other brothels, either in [[Ushuaia]] or elsewhere.&lt;ref name="dia04"/&gt; Kinan herself worked at two brothels in [[Ushuaia]]. Montoya said that he got calls from women asking to work at Sheik.&lt;ref name="dia04"/&gt; Montoya and his girlfriend and business partner Ivana Claudia García were responsible for recruitment, but García seems to have done most of the recruiting with help from her brother, whose sole function at the nightclub was recruiter.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/fecha-juicio-oral-emblematico-trata_0_BJlV0IN6.html | title=Tiene fecha el juicio oral de un emblemático caso de trata | dead-url=no |date=2016-09-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728144115/https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/fecha-juicio-oral-emblematico-trata_0_BJlV0IN6.html | archive-date=2017-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Black &amp; White ====
Women were recruited from various provinces, including [[Santiago del Estero]], [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], and [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], as well as from outside the country. Between 2009 and 2012, Victor Morales published more than 100 ads in [[Buenos Aires]] newspapers.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; Two of the ads running in the newspaper Clarin offered waitresses 20,000 pesos per month, and dancers 10,000 pesos per month. Both offered travel expenses to [[Ushuaia]], lodging, and relocation expenses.
&lt;ref name="rescataron"&gt;
{{cite news 
| title= Rescataron a 15 mujeres de una red de trata en Ushuaia

| archive-date= 2017-07-30 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The women who were recruited with these ads discovered that once they had arrived at [[Ushuaia]], they were expected to repay the travel costs. Morales was more honest with a sex worker he recruited through an ad and told her during their initial contact that she would repay him with the money from her sessions with clients.&lt;ref name="polemicas"/&gt; One of the sources who saw transcripts of the police wire taps put it this way:

{{ quote | text= According to the degree of naivety of the person who needed the job, [Morales] revealed more or less data.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; }}

While this approach may have helped persuade more women to travel to [[Ushuaia]], it also meant that some left as soon as they arrived.

Police telephone taps recorded the following conversation:

{{ quote | text=Nancy: Clearly, and the work is?

Victor: Well the work you mix with the public, you are not forced to prostitute yourself if you don't want, that is what you choose, when and how, yes? And the price, at least I put a price that from there up, you can charge more or equal, but not less, that are three hundred pesos fifteen minutes, four hundred the half hour, and five hundred an hour, and then the part, Let's say that it closes to me, that it serves me, the others let's say is a consequence, if you want to do it, you do and if you do not want to do it you do not do it, those are the services yes, but the drinks cost one hundred ...&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; }}

Morales wasn't telling her that both the city and provincial governments would label her a prostitute, the provincial police would fingerprint her, check her criminal record, and open a file on her, or that the city would periodically inspect her genitals, test her for STIs, and maintain a record of the results.

A women who had worked as a professional dancer answered one of Morales' ads for dancers. While Morales explains about selling drinks to "Nancy" in the transcript above, the dancer didn't learn about it until her first night in the nightclub. That was also when she learned that she was expected to make herself available for sexual sessions with the clients. When she objected to working in a brothel, one of the female managers slapped her and fined her four hundred pesos for talking back. She said that one night she hid in a bathroom and the managers beat her and forced her back to the bar.&lt;ref name="rossi"/&gt;

In contrast, eleven of the eighteen women at the brothel when the police raided it told investigators that they were there by their own choice. They didn't feel that they had been tricked or that they were being exploited.&lt;ref name="prueba"/&gt;

Over a period of two years, the city of [[Ushuaia]] issued seventy health books to Black &amp; White.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; Since each health book represents a new employee, the nightclub was recruiting about three new employees every month. Assuming that the nightclub employed an average of eighteen women over that two year time period, the average period of employment would be about six months. Once the nightclub hired a woman, it would need to recruit her replacement six months later.

In addition to ads, women were recruited through informal networks. One woman contacted Morales through a friend. Another was recruited through contacts at Madaho's, a well known bar (strip joint

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
) in the [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires|Recoleta]] neighborhood of [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

=== Living conditions ===
==== Sheik ====
During the trial, lawyers for the [[complainant]] described the women living in rooms off the main hall of the nightclub,&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; which they described as small, dirty, bad smelling, and visited by rats. Kinan described their quarters as a ''zulo'' (a cramped, impoverished living space) lacking hot water, with 2 people sharing a room.&lt;ref name="derogar"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eldiario.com.ar/sociedad/kinan-ldquohay-que-derogar-los-coacutedigos-de-contravencioacutenrdquo-1.htm# | dead-url=no | date=2017-03-26 | title=Kinan: "Hay que derogar los códigos de contravención" | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326165843/http://www.eldiario.com.ar/sociedad/kinan-ldquohay-que-derogar-los-coacutedigos-de-contravencioacutenrdquo-1.htm | archive-date=2017-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a bell in the area of the rooms activated at the bar which was rung to signal to the woman that a client had entered the nightclub.&lt;ref name="conocera"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.enperspectiva.com.ar/alika-el-29-de-noviembre-se-conocera-la-sentencia | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-08 | title=Alika Kinan: el 29 de noviembre se conocerá la sentencia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802011922/https://www.enperspectiva.com.ar/alika-el-29-de-noviembre-se-conocera-la-sentencia/ | archive-date=2017-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each room had its own entrance separate from the nightclub's main entrance and each of the women had their own key.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt;

Prior to the raid on Black &amp; White, the women serviced their clients in their rooms. Testimony at the trial described them using bleach to remove blood and semen stains from their mattresses.&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt; In addition to sharing a room with a coworker, each woman was also bringing clients into her room an average of two to three times a night. (See Money section.) With two women in a room, that would be a minimum of four client visits per room per night. There wouldn't have been much privacy.

A post on a monger board made in 2006 says that Sheik had four bedrooms, which matches with other testimony. However, the post says that Sheik had eighteen women working there at the time.
&lt;ref name="ushuaiaLists"&gt;{{cite web
 |title        = Ushuaia Lists

 |df           = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
If they were all living at the brothel, that would be four women in each of two rooms and five women in each of the other two, with a corresponding number of client visits to each room every night. Even if some of the women were living and servicing their clients off-site, it would have been pretty crowded.

==== Black &amp; White ====
Unlike Sheik, the women at Black &amp; White lived off-site. They shared a house with coworkers and paid 300 pesos rent per month.&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt; Rent for one room in [[Ushuaia]] can go as high as 15,000 pesos per month,&lt;ref name="privados"/&gt; so the rent charged by Black &amp; White was not unreasonable for shared living space. The nightclub had two rooms where the women and their clients had their sessions,&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt; so the women weren't bringing clients into their living space.

While the women at Sheik had keys to their living quarters, one witness reported being barred from leaving the house where Black &amp; White's employees lived. She said that there were three men who lived in the house who transported them between the house and the nightclub. When she wanted to walk out of the house onto the street in order to have a phone conversation with relatives without house mates around, the men prevented her from leaving.&lt;ref name="polemicas"/&gt;

In contrast, Kinan was working at Black &amp; White during all but a few months of the first three years she lived in [[Ushuaia]]. During this period she rented a place for her sister to live in, which suggests that she was free to travel around the city and conduct business.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; The dancer who objected to being tricked into working at a brothel sometimes left the house on her own and was allowed to use a computer with Internet access.&lt;ref name="rossi"/&gt;

One of the women was mentally ill, and the prosecutors said that she was imprisoned. From the prosecutors statements, it's impossible to tell if the brothel recruited her inadvertently and didn't know how to care for her properly while they figured out how to get rid of her, or if they were taking advantage of her illness in some way.

=== Interaction with clients ===
==== Sheik ====
The city is far enough south that during the summer there is daylight twenty four hours a day. The premises opened at 8 pm.&lt;ref name="sinFin" /&gt; The police testimony at the trial described women arriving at the nightclub from the living quarters.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; The women were required to be on duty from 11 pm to 6 am, and received one day off each week.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; (In one interview, Kinan said that the work shift started at 11:30 pm.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt;) However, Kinan testified that shifts could extend to 8 am or even 2 pm.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; There was a listing near the bar with prices for drinks and women. The women were available for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; Police witnesses said that men started arriving at the nightclub around midnight, and women would leave with the men, returning alone.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; When a customer left the nightclub with a woman, he had to pay the nightclub the price of a cup or half a cup, depending on how long the woman was going to be gone. (The nightclub paid 20 pesos for a drink and charged the customers 150 pesos, which the owner himself described as "cheating the customers".)&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt;

When the women first arrived at [[Ushuaia]], the nightclub seems to have given them names to use while working. Kinan was given the name "Carla".&lt;ref name="sinFin"/&gt; The women wore shorts or dresses while working, with tops, exaggerated high heels, and carefully styled hair. Clothing was brightly colored. Police officers described the clothing as scanty and less than is normally worn in a pub.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; (This may be an exaggeration. The [https://www.diomedia.com/stock-photo-prostitutes-in-ushuaia-argentina-image8281289.html two sex workers in a photo taken at the Black &amp; White Club] in [[Ushuaia]] look like any two women at a bar.)

Women were not allowed to wear the same clothes two days in a row and were required to smell like imported perfume. According to the owner Montoya, they were to be "fine whores".

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nightclub Black &amp; White had been raided about six months before the police raid at Sheik. Prior to the raid at Black &amp; White, the women at Sheik had serviced their clients in the rooms where they lived. After the raid at Black &amp; White, the women and their clients left Sheik and either went to the client's home or to a hotel room.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt;

Women who were menstruating were required to stanch the flow with a sponge to avoid getting the client dirty.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt;

Kinan described her clients as

{{ quote | text=politicians, municipal officials, government officials, even a commissioner would come and get me. Also those of fishing vessels and foreign tourists. And those who were going to ski that left the women in the hotels.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; }}

Until the raids, ''quecos'', or tours of the brothels, were an accepted male pastime.&lt;ref name="privados"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ushuaiaLists"/&gt;

Women could be fined for refusing a client, for client complaints, or "delaying too much" with a client (i.e. going over the allotted time).&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt; For poor single women supporting children, the fines were coercive. If a woman tried to avoid a fine by accepting a client with a bad reputation and showed displeasure during an abusive session, she could end up earning less if the client complained and she was fined. The women's ability to manage or negotiate client behavior was considerably reduced. Even the fine for "delaying too much" placed her at the client's mercy. Kinan describes the result:

{{ quote | text=... you find yourself with a crazy boy, a healthy son of the patriarchy, who breaks your ass, who leaves the vagina hanging, with everything that indicates an aggressive sexual act ... I could not handle them when they removed the condom, they would put me on all fours and they would break me. There are no women with rights inside a brothel.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The nightclub had installed bells in the women's rooms that they could ring if they needed help, for example if a client became violent. However, Kinan testified that often no one would come, the excuse being that the manager was busy with customers.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; In addition, women were expected to encourage clients to buy them the nightclub's overpriced drinks. The constant consumption of alcohol further reduced the women's ability to handle badly behaved clients. Kinan tells the following story, which illustrates the combined effects of coercive fines, too much alcohol, and managerial indifference:

{{ quote | text=One day I was smoking a cigarette and I see one of the girls, very young, Correntina, 18, who goes with an old man we already knew was terrible, a degenerate. Then I tell the manager not to let her go with that degenerate because she was very little. And he says, "Well, well, you're going to work." I say "poor girl," but I finished my cigarette and left, but then I see that he starts asking for the Fresita champagne, and takes seven in a period of an hour and a half, got drunk, a terrible state. I am very motherly, I always tried to take care of my companions, then I see that he is going to ask for the keys of the room where they had sex, and I tell the manager not to give them to him. But he leaves and I continue with what I was doing, I am preoccupied with my own work and I forget, it wasn't my job to monitor her, nor to take care of her, I had to take care of myself, for that there were the managers and so on. Then it was like five o'clock in the morning and the little girl appeared crying, she was still very drunk, and she says "he took me without a condom", and she tells me that she had fallen asleep from her drunkenness and he had raped her, I didn't know if there were one, five, or how many they had put into the room, and the manager only told her to take a bath in order to go to the hospital to ask for the pill the day after. And nobody saw anything, nobody heard anything, everything was covered because he was a customer and customers had to be taken care of.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

In at least one instance, the managers punished a women who used a bottle to defend herself against four clients who wanted to rape her. The information source doesn't say what the punishment was, only that it lasted a month. Her offense was failing to serve the clients well.
&lt;ref name="juicio"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of condoms, if a client was too forceful during penetration and tore one, the women got a syringe full of vinegar in the vagina.&lt;ref name="derogar"/&gt;

In regard to her experience with violent clients, Kinan says:

{{ quote | text= I have fought, my whole mouth is broken, because I fought to survive, with guys, with girls, guys might have paid me for a hotel and then they wanted to get me the same money they had given me because I do not know they did not like me, or they took too long and I had to go because I had to respond to a house, before the traffickers. [She had to return to the brothel.] Then they told me that they did not pay me anything or that I stayed until they told me. You have to endure rapes, consented or not, it is still a rape, if you are about to [be killed] you have to consent to a rape.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

==== Black &amp; White ====
The brothel operated from midnight to 6 am. According to an employee, the nightclub had the same clients found at Sheik: "... policemen, high-ranking officials, gendarmes and municipal personnel."&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; The fines were similar to the fines imposed at Sheik, and a client complaint or a session that went over its allotted time could cost a woman over half of her share of the earnings from the session.&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt;

=== Alcohol and drugs ===
{{ quote | text=Alcohol and drugs were good options to be able to make this situation more bearable.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt;

... we were forced to consume alcohol, we had to drink a lot, we used drugs to resist the long nights.&lt;ref name="distinguida"/&gt; }}

Aside from numbing effects of alcohol, the women were being paid to sell and consume drinks. The drinks the women persuaded the men to buy were an important source of income for both the women and the brothel. When a woman approached a potential client, she would tell him to buy her a drink.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; If a women averaged two to three sessions per night (see Money section), that suggests that a woman's clients bought her at least two drinks on the average night. Since she was getting a share of the earnings from the drinks, it was in her interest, financially if not in terms of health, to persuade clients to buy her more. According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, drinking more than three drinks per night or seven drinks per week is high-risk drinking for a woman.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brothels didn't sell drugs as part of their business, but they were present. They show up in Kinan's interviews as part of the environment she worked in. If a client paid for an hour with a woman and wanted her to do a line of coke with him, the ever-present threat of fines and the pressure to keep the client happy would have made it hard to refuse. Stimulants would also counter the effects of alcohol and help the woman stay alert enough to continue working into the morning.&lt;ref name="distinguida"/&gt;

=== Money ===
==== Sheik ====
Police officers who entered Sheik undercover said that women would approach the clients and tell them to buy them a drink, which was paid for at the bar.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; When the women and their clients conducted their sessions at a hotel, payment for the room was made at the bar.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt; However, the women seem to have collected the payment for their services directly from the clients and paid the nightclub's share to the manager.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; As mentioned in the Ushuaia section above, the women turned half of the money over to the nightclub.

The nightclub kept all the money for the first five drinks a woman persuaded customers to buy in one night, and then split the proceeds with the woman for all successive drinks. Kinan said that an average night for one woman was eighteen drinks and eight sessions with clients.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; (The Black &amp; White section below gives an estimate of two to three clients per night.) Given the high price of the drinks, the women's share of the proceeds from their sale was probably an important source of income for them.

Reportedly, they were forced to buy clothes, shoes, jewelery, perfumes and condoms from the nightclub. Women were fined for taking too long to come when the bell was rung, for not cleaning, for taking longer than the client paid for, for taking a day off, for refusing to have sex with a client, and for a number of other offences.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt;

Kinan described how the managers maintained the ''libro de pases''. In the brothel trade, a ''pase'' is a session in which a prostitute provides sexual services to a client. A ''libro de pases'' is basically a log of the brothel's business activities.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt;

==== Black &amp; White ====
The recruitment pitch quoted above gives minimum prices for sessions of between 300 and 500 pesos, depending on the time involved. Actual prices were between 600 and 800 pesos. The women kept 60% to 70% of the fee. Black &amp; White had the same system of fines as Sheik, with fines for being late, not cleaning, and going over the time the client had paid for, and so on. Most fines were around 300 pesos. The women where charged 400 pesos for each of the city's health inspections.&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt; The brothel transported women to [[Ushuaia]] by buying their airline tickets, and the women paid the brothel back from their earnings.

According to the testimony of the managers, each women generated 900 pesos a night in earnings for the brothel.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; Since the brothel was keeping 30% to 40% of the client fees, and the women were charging between 600 and 800 pesos, and the brothel was earning money from the drinks the women sold, then the women were probably averaging two to three men per night, less than half of Kinan's estimate. That would have made traffic through the two brothel bedrooms a lot more manageable.

When the nightclub was raided, none of the women had more than fifteen pesos with them. Their earnings were held by the Morales family, "for safety."&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; If they didn't have access to a bank, the house where they lived and where they had no control over who their house mates were was probably not a secure place to keep large sums of cash. Banking with the Morales family was probably more secure than cash under the mattress.

=== Credit and debt bondage ===
Claudia Quiroga, who managed Sheik at an earlier time, paid for the airline tickets that brought the women to [[Ushuaia]], bought clothes, paid for lodging, and the women paid her back from their earnings. Kinan described this as credit extended from Quiroga personally,&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; and the owner testified at his trial that the manager at the time of the police raid paid for the women's airplane tickets out of her salary.&lt;ref name="dia04"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lasrojas.com.ar/juicio-de-alika-dia-4 | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-11 | title=Juicio de Alika. Día 4 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807045002/http://lasrojas.com.ar/juicio-de-alika-dia-4/ | archive-date=2017-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably, the women would have repaid the manager and not the nightclub. This seems to show the managers personally making loans to the sex workers. On the other hand, the managers who made loans were part owners, and there may have been no clear line between their money and the nightclub's money.

At least some of the women who worked at Sheik arrived in such a state of poverty that the nightclub or its managers had to extend credit for the airplane fare, clothes for the women to wear while working, and housing. The employees would not have been able to work at Sheik and the nightclub would not have been able to recruit and keep employees without making loans to them.

Kinan has said "Every time we said we wanted to leave, we were told that we could not because we had debts,"&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; which suggests that employees were bound to the nightclub by [[debt bondage]]. Furthermore, the nightclub held the women's documentation,&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; which may have made it difficult to travel or leave the nightclub. However, Kinan was working at the Black &amp; White in 1996, which means she changed employer just a few months after she started working at Sheik.&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt; Without an accounting of the women's debts and a record of their movement between employers and into and out of the city, it's impossible to know how bound to their employers the women were.

[[Debt bondage]] usually involves high interest rates, which sometimes cause the debt to grow faster than it can be paid off. However, none of the available information on loans made to Sheik's employees mention interest. That, plus the personal nature of the loans, suggests that the nightclub wasn't making money off the loans. On the other hand, it's entirely possible that managers tried to stop women from leaving before they had repaid loans owed to the managers personally.

The many and intrusive fines could have been a cause of debt bondage. If the fines were levied often enough they could have caused the women's debts to grow faster than they could pay them off. But again, the women seemed to move between brothels on their own initiative. The fines seemed to be more effective as a means of control while the women were employed than as a means of keeping them from leaving employment.

When Kinan first arrived in [[Ushuaia]], the city was at the end of a manufacturing boom. Factory wages in [[Ushuaia]] were twice as high as they were in [[Buenos Aires]]. [[Baumol's cost disease]] indicates that service wages, including sex work wages, would also be doubled. But the cost of living was three times as high, meaning that both factory and service workers were earning less in real terms.&lt;ref name="trouble"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.luxner.com/cgi-bin/view_article.cgi?articleID=122 | dead-url=no | date=1995-07-02 | title=Trouble in world's southernmost city | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729131819/http://www.luxner.com/cgi-bin/view_article.cgi?articleID=122 | archive-date=2017-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During both periods that Kinan was working in [[Ushuaia]] as a sex worker, the cost of living was higher than more northern parts of Argentina. Anyone moving there for higher wages would discover that they were having trouble retaining the extra money they were earning. When the women at Sheik complained about not being able to hold on to a single peso, their complaints may have been due as much to the cost of living as to the fines and costs the brothel was imposing on them.

=== Children ===
{{ quote | text=I arranged for my daughters to be cared for away from me, so that they would not see the mother they had.

[After the raid] all I wanted was to be with my daughters&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

Aside from feelings of shame, it simply would not have been possible to raise children in the brothel. The shared living spaces, the presence of clients and the sexual services provided in the living spaces, the working hours that extended to 6 am or later, and the sale of alcohol all ruled out the presence of children.

All of the women were mothers and all of them were living apart from their children. When Kinan's life was turned upside down by the police raid, her first impulse was to return to her children. A full understanding the situation of Kinan and her coworkers would require an accounting of child care costs, knowing who provided child care and on what terms, and the complex of contradictory feelings they had toward their job and their children. That information isn't available.

=== Leaving employment ===
==== Sheik ====
As mentioned in the Recruitment section, sex workers in [[Ushuaia]] were recruited from all over Latin America, and Sheik itself had at least one recruiter. None of the available sources talk about leaving employment, but the presence of a recruiter shows that recruitment required more effort than the managers could devote to it on their own. Sheik employed only seven women and wasn't expanding its workforce, which indicates that women were leaving as fast as they were being recruited. As the city of the world closest to Antarctica, [[Ushuaia]] is isolated, has a harsh climate, and a small population. It doesn't attract a lot of people, making it necessary for the brothels to recruit from many countries to replace women leaving the city.

According to Kinan, women who behaved badly passed to other businesses where working conditions were worse.&lt;ref name="sinFin"/&gt; The owner of Sheik testified during the trial that he had had problems with Kinan and another woman and had intended to fire them.&lt;ref name="dia04"/&gt; However, he never did, which suggests that he would have had trouble replacing them.

As mentioned above, Kinan changed employers once and left the brothel to move to [[Spain]]. The owner of Sheik reported hiring from other brothels and getting phone calls from women who wanted to work for him. If the constant debts and the withholding of documentation were intended to bind the workers to their employers, the measures weren't entirely successful.

==== Black &amp; White ====
If, as indicated in the Recruitment section above, Black &amp; White was recruiting three new employees every month, then it was also losing three employees every month. Women were leaving six months after they were hired. Victor Morales' less-than-honest recruitment pitch resulted in some women leaving as soon as they arrived. The woman who was unnerved by the security cameras simply lifted the chain and walked out the door.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

One might imagine that the women who stayed would be the ones who had previous experience with sex work and were used to the work, but that's not necessarily the case. The two sex workers recruited from [[Rosario]] left at the first opportunity.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

One of the women taken into custody during the raid was about to be transferred to another province because "she was a problem for the owner," according to one of her coworkers.
&lt;ref name="saltena"&gt;
{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another woman was told that she was going to be sent to [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="rossi"/&gt; There's no mention of anyone actually being sent to another location, so these may have been empty threats made in an attempt to control someone's behavior.

While employed, the women didn't have possession of their earnings, which were held by the Morales family.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; This gave the managers an obvious way of collecting debts, provided the debt wasn't larger than the money the family held. In theory, the managers could have tried to prevent women from leaving the brothel by threatening to withhold their earnings, but none of the women appear to have complained about this happening. The fact that the cycle of recruitment and exit was so routine suggests that their exits were usually mutually agreed upon and the women left with their money.

The brothel held the identification documents of its employees. Almost all of them were at the bar in the nightclub, although a few were held in the owner's home.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; Getting a certificate of loss of documentation from the police is a matter of routine. The government of Argentina currently promises to provide replacement DNI cards within fifteen days of receiving an application. In the days of the ''libreta'' it reportedly could be done in a week to six weeks if there were no problems. Someone leaving the brothel and leaving their ID booklet behind could probably get a replacement.

The underage immigrant sex worker mentioned earlier that Morales recruited to work at the brothel doesn't seem to have been bound to the brothel when the managers held her documentation. When Morales recruited her, she was a seventeen year old immigrant from Paraguay who had been doing sex work prior to meeting him. She worked for him for two and a half years before leaving and making her way back to [[Buenos Aires]]. Several months after returning to [[Buenos Aires]] and just shortly before the police raid on Black &amp; White, Morales showed up on her doorstep asking her to come back to the brothel.&lt;ref name="polemicas"/&gt; She was clearly an employee that Morales wanted to keep, but either he returned her documentation when she wanted to leave, or lack of documentation didn't stop her from leaving and traveling across the country. If she returned to [[Buenos Aires]] without documentation, she either had it replaced or managed without it.

At both Sheik and Black &amp; White, fines, debt, and confiscating ID documentation may have helped managers control employee behavior, but they don't seem to have been particularly effective in preventing women from leaving. The ones that stayed the longest seemed to be the ones that had the worst job prospects. Alika Kinan and the Paraguayan immigrant both started sex work at seventeen because they couldn't support themselves any other way. Both came to [[Ushuaia]] in search of better paid sex work. Both left after working in the brothels for roughly three years. Kinan returned after eleven years of marriage left her with three children and no better job prospects. Length of employment seems to have had more to do with poverty and lack of alternative jobs than anything else.

=== Self-image ===
Immediately after the police raid at Sheik, all of the women denied being victims of trafficking and stated that they were sex workers who had been hired to do sex work.&lt;ref name="procesaron"/&gt; Two of them, Alika Kinan and another woman who has not been publicly identified, changed their minds and testified as victims during the trial, which occurred four years after the raid.

Kinan described herself and her coworkers at the time of the police raid:

{{ quote | text=We felt like criminals.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt;

When the rescue occurs I deny that I am a victim of trafficking, I said that I was not a victim and that I wanted to leave. I had just been taken from where I was and was my only source of income. At that time I had four daughters and I wanted to run and look for them and I felt guilty, I felt that I had committed a crime ...&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

On her work:

{{ quote | text=The concept I had was that the bitch is the one who goes to bed with someone and does not charge, so I'm a prostitute because I lie down and I charge, inside everything I was proud of that.

I always considered myself a fighter, who did whatever it took to support her family or my sister at that time or my daughters afterwards.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

Her rejection of victimization at the time of the raid:

{{ quote | text=How I was going to be victim, with the lioness and fighter that I was!&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

On the brothels:

{{ quote | text=the cabarets and the ''whiskerías'' burn your hands [Working at the brothels was like pressing your hands against something hot enough to burn them.]&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt;

But I never wanted to be there. You do not choose it, you don't say "I want to do this the rest of my days."&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; }}

On the health inspections:

{{ quote | text=We were thought of as food undergoing a food safety inspection.&lt;ref name="derogar"/&gt; }}

The effect of spending five hours in court describing life in the brothel:

{{ quote | text=When I testified, I realized that my life was shit.&lt;ref name="derogar"/&gt; }}

== Victim ==
In October 2012 Argentinian authorities raided Sheik.&lt;ref name="esclava" /&gt; Kinan and six other people retained were determined by the prosecuting authorities to be trafficking victims.&lt;ref name="denouncer" /&gt; This made her angry, but she gradually came to agree. She says that the thing that led her to change her mind was a question from the prosecutor's secretary:

{{ quote | text=If you analyze your history, that of your mother, that of your grandmother, that of your aunts, what do you think Is it going to be the destiny of your daughters?&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

This was followed by what she describes as a long, agonizing process of self-reflection.

{{ quote | text= The first year is terrible, it is a process of denial, you can not believe everything that is happening to you, you are trying to reconcile at a family level, a series of things, and it is not easy.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

The city of [[Ushuaia]] supplied her with housing for one month and twenty days.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; The house had been declared uninhabitable by the Ministry of Social Development several months previously.
&lt;ref name="unaVezMas"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At one point Kinan says her family almost died from fumes from a faulty water heater. The authorities response was to shut off the gas, leaving them without heating.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; (Mean temperature in [[Ushuaia]] in the warmest month of the year is below 50&amp;nbsp;°F.) When the city tried to evict her at the end of the term,&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; she turned to the María de los Angeles Foundation (founded by the mother of [[Marita Verón]]) for help, and the foundation's lawyers informed her that she was entitled to decent housing, work, subsidies, and to be reinserted into society.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; Kinan said:

{{ quote | text=I go back to the prosecution and I tell them that I was pressured to recognize myself as a victim and that now nobody wanted to represent me, that I had no psychologist and was in a house without heating. They destroyed me, made me recognize something that I never wanted to recognize, and when I recognize it, it turns out that I do not have the rights.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

Through the intervention of governor Fabiana Ríos, Kinan was granted a plot of land by the city of [[Ushuaia]] and a subsidy of 250,000 pesos to build a house. She signed a contract for 259,224 pesos for the house construction, but the contractor was apparently unable to carry out the contract. As the Court of Accounts was setting a deadline and threatening to sue for return of the subsidy, the State Attorney filed a case for eviction, to remove Kinan and her family from the temporary housing she was living in until the new house was built.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Her lawyer claimed that the necessary documents had been filed a month previously. He pointed out that it's not possible to build a house in [[Ushuaia]] for 250,000 pesos, and the prefab housing company Kinan signed a contract with couldn't meet the city's documentation requirements. In the end, he was able to stave off the eviction, but Kinan's temporary house continued to be unheated.

Kinan became a [[complainant]] in the criminal case against her managers, and simultaneously filed a civil suit against her ex-managers and the municipality of [[Ushuaia]].&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; The legal theory behind the civil suit seems to have been the following: The city conducted regular medical exams on each sex worker in the city's brothels and recorded the results in a book the city maintained for each sex worker. In doing this with each of the city's prostitutes, the city regularized prostitution and became legally complicit in any trafficking that occurred. When her ex-managers were convicted of trafficking in the criminal case, the city became liable for the harm Kinan suffered as a prostitute under the city's jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt;

A social worker writing the initial report on Kinan concluded that she had not been a victim because she had not been submissive. When Kinan came to view herself as a victim, she made a claim to the authorities for her rights as a victim of [[trafficking]], but was not recognized. She appealed to the courts, which refused her because the judge held that she had consented. At the next level of appeal, the [[appellate court]] found that there was a possibility that she had been a [[trafficking]] victim, but since she had not declared herself a victim when her employer was raided, she could not do so now.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; None of the available sources describe how this was resolved, but eventually she was recognized as a victim.

== Leadup to trial ==
On November 19, 2011, a woman from [[Tucumán province]] in [[Argentina]] filed a complaint, claiming that she had been exploited in a brothel called Sheik in [[Ushuaia]]. She claimed that she lived there with other women, between the ages of twenty one and twenty eight, who were natives of Argentine, the Dominican Republic, and Colombia. On April 12, 2012, the head of Prosecutor's Office for Trafficking and Exploitation of Persons filed a formal complaint in the Federal Court of Ushuaia against the brothel.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After an investigation, the National Gendarmerie raided the nightclub on October 8, 2012.&lt;ref name="operativo"/&gt;

The lead up to the trial involved the usual legal maneuvering. Originally there were six defendants, but three were dismissed by the investigating judge. The first of these was Claudia Quiroga, Pedro Montoya's ex-wife, who owned the property where Sheik was located and had been Montoya's business partner. The second was Corina Sánchez, who had been the on-site supervisor. These two were no longer involved with the brothel at the time of the raid. The third person dismissed from the trial was Jorge Etcheverry, recruiter and brother of Ivana García, Montoya's girlfriend and business partner when the raid occurred.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt;

Kinan's lawyer objected to the dismissals. The investigating judge had postponed Kinan's testimony repeatedly, and eventually dismissed the three without evidence from Kinan. Her lawyer insisted that Kinan could "provide evidence, new data, more information regarding these accused and what their responsibility is."&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; She appealed the dismissals, but they were sustained and the trial headed for the court date with only three defendants.

A week before the trial began, Kinan's sister and ex-husband began criticizing her publicly. The sister, Maria Fernanda, who still lives in Europe, sent Kinan's ex-husband a video&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; of a sexual scene in which the female was purportedly one of Kinan's daughters. It was later proved that the video did not involve her daughter.
&lt;ref name="necesitan"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kinan's sister claimed that she had received it from someone in [[Ushuaia]]. Maria Fernanda said there was no truth in her sister's claims and she was concerned for her nieces. Kinan's ex-husband released the video to a journalist and claimed that his daughters were at risk. He was living in Scotland and said he couldn't afford to travel to [[Ushuaia]], but offered to testify against his ex-wive via videoconference.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt;

She also began getting threats.&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt; On a street in downtown [[Ushuaia]], a group of people shouted ""Be careful what you are going to say at the trial." She received threats and insults on her cell phone and through her Facebook account. The trial prosecutor called the threats "a well organized operation." The week before the trial she felt so threatened that she kept herself and her family in the house.
&lt;ref name="amenazan"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The police guarded her house until the beginning of the trial, and she joined a witness protection program.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt;

On a positive note, she got a new personal lawyer for the trial, a woman she felt she could trust: Marcela Rodríguez, the coordinator of the Counseling and Sponsorship Program for Victims of Trafficking in Persons of the Office of the Ombudsman. And a large number of number of social and feminist organizations organized in her support.&lt;ref name="amenazan"/&gt;

== Trial ==
Because she continued to receive threats during the trial, Kinan's protectors restricted her movement and communication. One observer pointed out that the people eventually convicted of trafficking her were not detained and enjoyed complete freedom of movement and communication.&lt;ref name="unaVezMas"/&gt;

Argentina doesn't have separate civil and criminal courts, and the civil and criminal cases against Kinan's managers at the nightclub Sheik were carried out simultaneously before the same panel of judges. During the trial, Kinan testified in a Gesell chamber, so that the accused were not able to witness her testimony.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; A witness known only as "F" testified under the same conditions.&lt;ref name="finalizo"/&gt;

=== Criminal trial ===
The defendants were charged with violating [[Argentina]]'s anti-trafficking law. The law has a four part test for trafficking: recruitment; transport; receiving and/or harboring persons; and exploitation. (See [[Human trafficking in Argentina]].) The prosecution claimed that the defendants recruited by advertising in media, they transported their victims by advancing money for their plane tickets, and they received and harbored them by meeting them at the airport and bringing them to the brothel and housing them there. To show exploitation they claimed that the victims had characteristics of social vulnerability when recruited, and that they were bound to the brothel by debts and rules that compromised their ability to leave when they chose.&lt;ref name="procesaron"/&gt;

The prosecutors argued that requiring the women to use a sponge during menstruation was proof that the women weren't working willingly. (Many independent escorts use a sponge so their clients won't know that they're menstruating, and some prefer the sponge to the usual tampons and sanitary napkins. However, women vary a lot in the pain they experience during menstruation. Even a woman who usually doesn't have problems may have a bad month. Escorts participating in a discussion of this on an on-line forum said that forcing women to work when they feel bad or need rest is exploitative, even if the sponge itself isn't a problem.
&lt;ref name="sponge0"&gt;

| url= https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnEscort/comments/6qtoga/feelings_about_the_sponge 
| access-date= 2017-08-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Kinan's lawyer argued that the defendants' actions violated the 1949 UN protocol on trafficking, which [[Argentina]] has signed. (See [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]].) She pointed out that under the protocol, a victim's consent is immaterial.&lt;ref name="juicio"/&gt;

Montoya's lawyer made the following arguments:

{{ quote | text=[The night club was a] duly authorized establishment and the accusation of sex in exchange for money has not been proven and there were no places where they had sex. There is no concrete proof of these federal crimes.&lt;ref name="vigencia"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

He pointed out that Montoya had faced a similar charge in the provincial court in 2011 and the case had been dismissed.

{{ quote | text=... now the same complaint has been reissued in Federal, therefore we will ask for acquittal.&lt;ref name="vigencia"/&gt; }}

Excerpts from Pedro Montoya's testimony:

{{ quote | text=I am being tried for a crime that I consider to be aberrant. I do not consider that I have deviated from the law. I do not see them as victims but rather as majority partners. I am the minority partner of the ladies.

[Trafficking] is a fashionable crime.

This is a trade in which we take advantage of both of a man's needs, because the man needs to go to a place to look for company. The public goes and the women act as psychologists ... Sometimes men went after spending forty days on board.

The girl is in the capacity of entertainer because they are to entertain and be a companion of a person. It is a service of accompaniment or entertainment that is framed in the Collective Agreement of Work according to an ordinance of the Deliberating Council.

[Clients] had to pay the value of a glass for the time that they were going to be absent from the place ... I consider relationships outside the nightclub to be an agreement between two people, it is not my problem.

There was no [criminal] organization here at all. This business made me tired, it caused me psychophysical discomforts and even losses sometimes.&lt;ref name="socio"/&gt;

I asked my lawyer and he answered that we were not guilty of any crime and we were under the ordinances in force, subject to inspections, of all the Armed Forces, Gendarmerie, Police, Migrations, Public Ministry of Labor, Sadaic, Capif, DGR Province and, of course, Municipality Of Ushuaia, licensing organs that always inspected the commercial activity carried out. I always thought I was doing a lawful job.&lt;ref name="vigencia"/&gt; }}

=== Civil trial ===
A team of psychologists and psychiatrists asserted that Kinan suffered from [[PTSD]] which caused sleep disorders and made her afraid of embracing and of touching things that had passed through many hands, such as money. They recommended psychological counseling three times a week for twenty years, which would cost 2,496,000 pesos at current prices. In addition, scars on her face and missing teeth were physical evidence of the violence she had suffered. The experts testified that Kinan is expected to be 70% incapacitated.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt;

The municipality of [[Ushuaia]] argued that it had no legal liability because any laws and international treaties violated by the brothel's actions fell under the jurisdiction of the federal and provincial governments, and the city's actions had all been consistent with law. It also pointed out that it was cooperating with a foundation created by Alika Kinan for the purpose of assisting victims of trafficking.&lt;ref name="juicio"/&gt;

The doctor from Ushuaia Regional Hospital who issued the health books testified. When asked if she ever issued health books to men, she said she only issued them to women and "sex change."&lt;ref name="finalizo"/&gt;

== Outcome of trial ==
On 30 November 2016, the court decided in Kinan's favor. The city of [[Ushuaia]] was ordered to pay Kinan 780,000 [[Argentine peso|pesos]] (about US$47,000.) The owner of Sheik received a [[prison sentence]] of seven years and a fine of 70,000 pesos. His girlfriend/business partner got a three-year [[suspended sentence]] and a fine of 30,000 pesos. The woman who managed the club received a three-year [[suspended sentence]].

As part of the suspended sentences, the court placed restrictions on where the two women could reside, required them to avoid overconsumption of alcohol, and ordered them to refrain from using narcotics.

The [[prosecutor]] stated that even though the penalties were less than the prosecution had requested, the [[verdict]] was a change in the way the [[judicial system]] viewed [[sex trafficking]].&lt;ref name="sentencia"/&gt;

== Epilogue ==
On 1 December 2016, the court published the grounds for its decision. At that point the convicted exercised their right of [[appeal]] and remained free. Kinan continues to feel anxiety over the outcome and she's also still getting threats.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The protective personnel provided by the government Program for Rescue were withdrawn.&lt;ref name="unaVezMas"/&gt;

The [[Ushuaia]] city counsel ended the licensing of brothels in 2013, effectively putting them all out of business.&lt;ref name="privados"/&gt; Many of the women left to continue [[sex work]] elsewhere. Most of them went to [[Punta Arenas]] in [[Chile]].&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt; A ferry service connects [[Punta Arenas]] with the island of [[Tierra del Fuego]] where [[Ushuaia]] is located, making it easy to move there. The brothels of southern [[Chile]] are active, operate similarly to the ones driven out of [[Ushuaia]],&lt;ref name="otherMenus"/&gt; and [[Punta Arenas]] is visited by the same types of ships that gave [[Ushuaia]] many of its customers for its sex business.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt;

The women left, but they've been replaced. There are still places where you can rent a room for an hour. There's a wider variety of business models, but the dominant one is reportedly the private apartment. While Kinan and her coworkers lived two to a room, the new model is three to an apartment. If sex workers in [[Ushuaia]] benefited from closing the brothels, it was primarily from the change in housing; they now have hot water. Women still come from the same places far away from [[Ushuaia]], but they rotate in and out faster. Advertising is done on the web, where the pictures and names change, but the phone numbers stay the same. Periodically, the police raid an apartment and liberate its occupants, rendering them homeless until they can reconnect with their pimps. While they are working for their pimps, they are plagued by the same system of debts that plagued Kinan and her coworkers. When the police liberate them, they become homeless mothers with no way of supporting their children.&lt;ref name="privados"/&gt; Kinan believes that the official count of rescued women is inflated because many of the women have been rescued one or more times previously.

{{ quote | text=Why do the victims relapse? Because they have no resources, because there are no public policies, because politicians make policy under the banner of "Not One Less" but they haven't filed even one bill that protects women. The trafficking law came without legs, it doesn't function. I am grateful because it rescued me and freed me from a brothel, helped me grow as a militant and empower me. But after I was released, after being told that I was a victim all these years and that I had to go home with my daughters I thought "What do I live for? What I do?" The Law of Trafficking doesn't work without public policies, that is to say, access to housing, therapeutic psychological support for victims of trafficking, reintegration into genuine work and access to education.&lt;ref name="extrema"/&gt; }}

Kinan currently works at the National University of San Martín, in Buenos Aires, doing research and giving lectures on human trafficking, and organizes activities related to the same topic.

== Kinan on sex work ==
Kinan is an abolitionist opposed to decriminalization. She believes that trafficking can only be abolished by giving women the things that she herself has struggled for.

{{ quote | text=I always insist, when you ask me if I am an abolitionist, yes, I am because I am convinced that if a woman in a state of vulnerability, who is being sexually exploited, you give her or she is given a series of instruments to defend herself in life, education, a well-paid job, not one in the informal economy where she earns little, decent housing where she can support her family even though she is single, I'm sure that woman does not prostitute herself, I'm totally convinced she does not arrive at prostitution. Then, by that point, I consider myself an abolitionist ...&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

In Kinan's view, women enter sex work because they lack housing, jobs, and education. But she also views sex workers as trapped by not understanding that they are victims and have rights.

{{ quote | text=Because you are very afraid, you are not sure if you are a victim or you are not a victim, you don't become aware if you are a victim, if you knew that you were a victim, you would ask for help immediately. Social myth is "Why don't these women who are locked up ask for help at the time? Why don't they come out screaming that they are in these places where they are being exploited sexually, if as a society we know this is wrong?" Because the victims do not know, because they have a great ignorance about international treaties signed by our country, there is a great ignorance that our country is abolitionist.&lt;ref name="carne"&gt;
{{cite news

| archive-date= 2017-07-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

For Kinan, the alternative to abolishing sex work is regulating it. Her experience of regulation was the medical exams at [[Ushuaia]], where physicians authorized by the city ridiculed and disparaged the sex workers they were examining. This combined with similar treatment from clients leads her to place regulators and clients in interlocking roles.

{{ quote | text=The Municipality set up the sanitary notebooks, very much like Senasa or bromatological analysis. [SENASA is the federal food safety agency in Argentina.] Did you see when you go to buy meat in the supermarket? There you walk down the aisle and you see that everything has passed through sanitary inspections, and that the meat is fit for human consumption. And you are one more piece of meat. The client of prostitution enters the premises and says I'm having a ribeye, or a piece of beef, a hamburger. You feel like the merchandise that has given up its own will, to be consumed, to be raped.&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

Kinan wants to attack commercialized sex in three steps. First is the end of government regulation and shutting down sex-related businesses via the existing anti-trafficking law. The next step is to eliminate the commodity being sold by giving women the resources that make it unnecessary for them to turn to sex work for survival.

{{ quote | text=At the moment the most important thing is to be able to conjoin the Law of Trafficking with real public policies, that restore the rights of the victims in terms of housing and labor solutions. And the supportive therapy and the ability to provide them with education.&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

Failure to take this step means that women return to their traffickers.

{{ quote | text=When we talk about Human Rights, it is wonderful that we have the closure of brothels, which are clandestine and non-clandestine centers of torture and sexual exploitation, but what do we do to avoid having the same victim show up in later raids, as has happened?&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

The final step is to eliminate the buyer by criminalizing the client, but this must proceed from the second step described above, which Kinan calls "the restoration of rights."

{{ quote | text=We have a lot of work ahead of us, regarding the restoration of rights, of women who are victims of trafficking and from there to be able to advance in a direct line on the criminalization of the client of prostitution.&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

Argentina has a union of sex workers called Ammar that is part of CTA, a trade union federation. As a sex worker, Kinan saw herself as a strong woman doing a difficult job, but she now believes that viewpoint is a part of victimization.

{{ quote | text=I saw myself as a strong woman who had come there because I had no choice, a concept that is also part of the crime of trafficking, because that is what you are made to believe when you enter the circuit.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; }}

She has no sympathy for Ammar or other sex worker rights organizations, viewing them as essentially the same as the managers at the brothels where she worked.

{{ quote | text=For me Ammar is a union and acts as such, these women have never stood at the street corners, none of them are kept in the brothels as victims, but they have presided over brothels and have presided over women. My personal opinion is that they are trying to take care of their backs for future raids that are made for the crime of trafficking. It is not innocent that they have gone from claiming rights and guarantees as autonomous prostitutes and today demand the reopening of brothels. Argentina and the Constitution are abolitionist, where clearly we are not going to allow prostitution to exist on behalf of others.&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

== Discrepancies ==
Part of Alika Kinan's story is the fact that news sources report things about her that are contradicted by other sources. Since there's no way of knowing why different information is being reported a different times, nothing in this section should be taken as evidence that anyone is intentionally being untruthful.

=== Age of arrival at Ushuaia ===
In at least two different interviews, Kinan has apparently said that she was eighteen years old when she arrived at [[Ushuaia]].

&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; Another source said she was fifteen.&lt;ref name="distinguida"/&gt; She was reportedly born on June 24, 1976.&lt;ref name="calvario"/&gt; She has said that she was thirty six when Sheik was raided in 2012,&lt;ref name="desesperado"/&gt; and in 2017 she said that she was forty one,&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; both of which would be consistent with a 1976 birth date. Various sources state that she came to [[Ushuaia]] to work at Sheik in 1996.&lt;ref name="juicio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calvario"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desesperado"/&gt;&lt;ref name="extrema"/&gt;&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sinFin"/&gt; So she was either nineteen or twenty, and in either case closer to her twentieth birthday than her nineteenth.

=== Time in sex work ===
One source says Kinan was trapped by prostitution for twenty years.&lt;ref name="extrema"/&gt; Another says that she was trapped in a brothel for nearly twenty years.&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; Another claims that she was "a victim of trafficking networks and male clients for two decades."

And another says she was "a victim of forced prostitution for 16 years."&lt;ref name="distinguida"/&gt;

She did sex work in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] for three years, worked in brothels in [[Ushuaia]] for three years, and after returning to [[Ushuaia]] from [[Spain]], worked in one brothel for another two years. These three time periods add up to about eight years.

=== Number of brothels ===
When news reports say that Kinan was trapped in a brothel for twenty years, they're referring to the brothel named Sheik. In [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], she worked at a brothel named Aries.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; In [[Ushuaia]], she worked at both Sheik&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calvario"/&gt; and Black &amp; White.&lt;ref name="redito"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt;

=== Entrapment ===
On the subject of entrapment, a writer familiar with the details of Kinan's history wrote that "Alika Kinan was not kidnapped or cheated..."&lt;ref name="incomoda"/&gt;

One news report says that she was held prisoner.

The sources cited use the word "trapped" in a context implying some sort of physical coercion. In [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] she didn't live in the brothel. The brothel work paid for the place she rented for herself and her younger sister.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; While working at Black &amp; White she rented another place for her sister, indicating that she could travel around the city and conduct business.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; While working at Sheik, she had keys to the entrance to her living quarters. She worked under abusive and expolitative conditions, compelled by poverty and the need to support people dependent on her. But she has ruled out physical coercion in two different interviews.&lt;ref name="extrema"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt;

As far as trickery or deceptive recruiting is concerned, in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] there was no need for the brothel to recruit her. She and her sister were starving, she was desperate, and she had no alternatives. She went to [[Ushuaia]] to work at Sheik because they paid better.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; It's not clear why she moved from Sheik to Black &amp; White, but at Sheik she kept fifty percent of the client fees and at Black &amp; White she kept sixty to seventy percent. Also, the women at Black &amp; White didn't have to entertain their clients in their living quarters.&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt;

=== Number of clients per night ===
In 2015 a news report said that Kinan had up to ten or twelve clients a night.&lt;ref name="heroina"/&gt; In 2016 she estimated an average of eight clients per night.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; In 2017, she told one interviewer that she had seen fifteen to thirty men per night,&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; and she told another that she had twenty to thirty men per night.&lt;ref name="heroina"/&gt;

As stated in the Money section above, brothel revenue data indicates that the women working in the brothels were averaging two to three clients per night.

=== Isolation ===
According to NPR, the women working in the brothel couldn't make friends outside the brothel.&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; In [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], Kinan actually did have friends outside the brothel. At both brothels in [[Ushuaia]], she appears to have had freedom of movement outside the brothels. However, [[Ushuaia]] was a small city, everyone knew what she did for a living, and sex work has a lot of stigma. She probably was socially isolated, but mostly because of the stigma associated with her work.

'''''BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United States''''', {{Ussc|541|176|2004}}, is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court decided sand and gravel are not "valuable minerals" reserved to the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] under the [[Pittman Underground Water Act|Pittman Underground Water Act of 1919]]. The Court sided in a 6–3 decision with the petitioner, BedRoc Limited, and reversed the decision of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court]]. BedRoc Limited had removed sand and gravel from lands obtained under the Pittman Act, and the United States, the respondent, argued those were reserved to the U.S. Government under that law.

[[William Rehnquist]] wrote the [[majority opinion]], that relied on a [[Textualism|textualist]] approach, and was joined by three justices. He argued sand and gravel were not considered "valuable minerals" in Nevada when the Pittman Act was passed in 1919. A concurring opinion was written by [[Clarence Thomas]], and joined by another justice. Two justices joined [[John Paul Stevens|John P. Stevens']] [[dissenting opinion]], that relied on legislative history and a previous decision of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Lin"&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://law.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Lin/files/Erosive-Interpretation-of-Environmental-Law.pdf |format =PDF |title =EROSIVE INTERPRETATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW IN THE SUPREME COURT’S 2003-04 TERM |last =Lin |first =Albert C. |pages =588 and 589 |access-date =26 February 2017 |website =UCDavis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 1940, Newton and Mabel Butler patented {{Convert|560|acres}} of land under the Pittman Underground Water Act ({{coord|36.977|-114.984}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.oha.doi.gov/IBLA/Ibladecisions/140IBLA/140IBLA295.pdf |title =IBLA 93-414 |format =PDF |access-date =11 March 2017 |website =Office of Hearings and Appeals |date =6 October 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The land was situated in [[Lincoln County, Nevada]], {{Convert|65|miles}} north of [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name="SCOTUS"/&gt; A tenant started extracting sand and gravel in the early 1990s. The land was sold to Earl Williams in 1993, and he continued to remove sand and gravel from the land. That same year, Williams received two [[trespass]] notices from the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM), that argued he was removing mineral materials from public lands.&lt;ref name="Ninth District"&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F3/314/314.F3d.1080.01-17080.html |access-date =14 February 2017 |date =30 December 2002 |website =[[Public.Resource.Org]] |title =314 F.3d 1080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams challenged the notices, but the BLM ruled that the government held a reservation to the "valuable minerals" on the land.&lt;ref name="SCOTUS"&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/03pdf/02-1593.pdf |format =PDF |title =''BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United States'': Opinion of REHNQUIST, C. J. |page =3 |date =31 March 2005 |access-date =11 February 2017 |website =Supreme Court of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, BedRoc Limited, LLC bought the land, and continued to remove sand and gravel under an interim agreement with the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. Under the agreement, BedRoc Limited had to place money in [[escrow]] from the sale of each cubic yard of sand and gravel that the company removed, pending a final resolution. A year later, BedRoc Limited transferred {{Convert|40|acres}} of the land to Western Elite, Inc. The Interior Board of Land Appeals upheld the decision by the BLM in 1997, relying on the legislative history of the Pittman Act and on Congress' intent.&lt;ref name="Ninth District"/&gt;

Subsequently, BedRoc Limited filed an action to [[quiet title]] in the [[United States District Court for the District of Nevada|United States District Court of Nevada]]. BedRoc Limited demanded ownership of the sand and gravel, while the American government asked for trespass damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.justice.gov/osg/brief/bedroc-limited-llc-v-united-states-opposition |access-date =14 February 2017 |website =United States Department of Justice |title =BEDROC LIMITED, LLC V. UNITED STATES - OPPOSITION |date =July 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 24, 1999, Justice [[Philip Martin Pro]] of the Court decided that sand and gravel were "valuable minerals" reserved to the American government under the Pittman Act. The Court asked itself whether sand and gravel were minerals, whether they were valuable, and whether the "nonmineral" certification of the Pittman Act had any influence. The Court argued sand and gravel were minerals, and decided they were valuable under the Pittman Act based on Congress' intent and on debates. Besides, the Court argued lands containing minerals could be classified as nonmineral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/50/1001/2332552/ |date =24 May 1999 |website =Justia |title =BedRoc Ltd., LLC v. United States, 50 F. Supp. 2d 1001 (D. Nev. 1999) |access-date =15 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BedRoc Limited appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court]], and Western Elite was added as a [[plaintiff]]. The three-judge panel consisting of Judges [[Michael Daly Hawkins]], [[Susan P. Graber]], and [[Richard C. Tallman]] argued on November 7, 2002, and affirmed the decision by the District Court. The opinion was written by Graber. After concluding the language of the Pittman Act itself was ambiguous, the Court deserted to the purpose of the law and to the legislative history. The Ninth Circuit Court decided sand and gravel were "valuable minerals" reserved to the United States, because there was a market for sand and gravel when the Pittman Act was enacted, and because Congress intended the reservation of the Pittman Act to be the same as the mineral reservation of the [[Stock-Raising Homestead Act]]. The Court said "the mineral reservation [was] to be read broadly in the light of the agricultural purpose [of the law]." BedRoc argued a site-specific analysis had to be used to determine whether sand and gravel were valuable, but the Court disagreed.&lt;ref name="Ninth District"/&gt;

The Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] on September 30, 2003, and the oral argument occurred on January 20 of the following year. During the argument, BedRoc Limited was represented by R. Timothy McCrum, while the United States Government was represented by [[Tom Sansonetti|Thomas L. Sansonetti]]. All justices asked questions or made remarks except for Clarence Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.oyez.org/cases/2003/02-1593|title=BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United States |website =[[Oyez Project]] |access-date =13 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal background ==
The patent to the land was granted under the [[Pittman Underground Water Act]], that went into effect in 1919. Under that law, the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] could grant patents to people who established a water supply. It only applied to Nevada. The eighth section of the Pittman Act stated that each patent contained "a reservation to the United States of all the coal and other valuable minerals in the lands" and the right for the government to "prospect for, mine and remove the same" under the laws in force during a disposal of the minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/03pdf/02-1593.pdf |format =PDF |title =''BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United States'': Opinion of REHNQUIST, C. J. |pages =2–3 |date =31 March 2005 |access-date =11 February 2017 |website =Supreme Court of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court cited ''[[Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc.]]'', a 1983 Supreme Court decision, in which the Court interpreted the mineral reservation of the [[Stock-Raising Homestead Act]] (SRHA), that was enacted in 1916. The Supreme Court decided gravel was a mineral reserved to the government under the SRHA. The Court looked at whether gravel was part of the surface estate, which belongs to the patentee, or to the mineral estate, which belongs to the government. It decided substances are reserved to the government when they are mineral in character, can be removed from the soil, can be used for commercial purposes, and when there is no reason for the substance to be included in the surface estate. The mineral reservation of the SRHA differs from the one of the Pittman Act, as the SRHA does not include the word "valuable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/03pdf/02-1593.pdf |format =PDF |title =''BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United States'': Opinion of REHNQUIST, C. J. |pages =4–5 |date =31 March 2005 |access-date =11 February 2017 |website =Supreme Court of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opinion of the court ==
The Court decided on March 31, 2004, and delivered three opinions. The majority opinion was supported by four justices, the concurring opinion by two, and the dissenting opinion by three. The majority argued sand and gravel were not valuable when the law was passed in 1919 according to common sense, while the dissenting opinion said the emphasis on the word "valuable" was unjust, and said it was Congress' intent to include sand and gravel in the reservation. The concurring opinion acknowledged the emphasis on valuable was unjust, while saying the word "mineral" itself includes the requirement of commercial purpose as was decided in ''Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc.''

=== Majority opinion ===
[[File:William Rehnquist.jpg|thumb|135px|Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]]]]
The majority opinion was written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and joined by Justices [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[Antonin Scalia]], and [[Anthony Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/03pdf/02-1593.pdf |format =PDF |title =''BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United States'': Opinion of REHNQUIST, C. J. |page =1 |date =31 March 2005 |access-date =11 February 2017 |website =Supreme Court of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting a [[Textualism|textualist]] approach, the majority held that sand and gravel were not "valuable minerals" reserved to the government.&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt; The Court said it would not extend its decision in ''Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc.'' to say that sand and gravel are valuable minerals. According to the majority, the Court had to focus on the meaning of the law when it was enacted, and it asked itself "whether the sand and gravel found in Nevada were commonly regarded as “valuable minerals” in 1919." According to the majority, common sense said no, as sand and gravel were abundant, had no intrinsic value, and were commercially worthless in Nevada in 1919. The Court said sand and gravel could not be mistaken for "valuable minerals" no matter if they would be regarded as minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/03pdf/02-1593.pdf |format =PDF |title =''BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United States'': Opinion of REHNQUIST, C. J. |pages =6–8 |date =31 March 2005 |access-date =11 February 2017 |website =Supreme Court of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the Pittman Underground Water Act stated the disposal had to happen "in accordance with the provisions of the coal and mineral land laws in force at the time of such disposal." The Court said Congress was referring to [[General Mining Act of 1872]], that stated "all valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the United States" were "free and open to exploration and purchase." The majority said it was undeniable that "common sand and gravel could not constitute a locatable "valuable mineral deposit" under the General Mining Act."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/03pdf/02-1593.pdf |format =PDF |title =''BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United States'': Opinion of REHNQUIST, C. J. |pages =8–9 |date =31 March 2005 |access-date =11 February 2017 |website =Supreme Court of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority did not consider the legislative history as it did in ''Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc.'', as the Pittman Act explicitly used the word "valuable" in contrast to the Stock-Raising Homestead Act (SRHA). Because of the absence of the word "valuable" in the SRHA, the Court had to speculate about Congress' intent in ''Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc.'' Furthermore, by deciding in favor of the plaintiff, the Court left its principle that "land grants are construed favorably to the Government... and if there are doubts they are reserved for the Government, not against it," which it called an "established rule" in ''Wat v. Western Nuclear, Inc.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url =http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1789&amp;context=elq |last =Ryan |first =Katherine Daniels |access-date =12 March 2017 |volume =32 |issue =3 |year =June 2005 |journal =[[Ecology Law Quarterly]] |pages =685 and 686 |title = The Supreme Court Modifies Homestead Claimants' Property Rights in BedRoc Ltd. v. United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clarence Thomas official.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Justice [[Clarence Thomas]]]]

=== Concurring opinion ===
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion, that was joined by Justice [[Stephen Breyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/03pdf/02-1593.pdf |format =PDF |title =''BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United States'': THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment |page =1 |date =31 March 2005 |access-date =11 February 2017 |website =Supreme Court of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas agreed with the dissenting opinion that no distinction could be made between the mineral reservation in the Pittman Underground Water Act and in the Stock-Raising Homestead Act (SRHA). He, however, argued that sand and gravel are not part of the mineral reservations of both laws, disagreeing with ''Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/03pdf/02-1593.pdf |format =PDF |title =''BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United States'': THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment |pages =1–2 |date =31 March 2005 |access-date =11 February 2017 |website =Supreme Court of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas argued the emphasis the majority lays on the word "valuable" was unjust, as the Pittman Act uses "valuable minerals" and "minerals" interchangeably. Thomas said both phrases therefore were meant as synonymous. Moreover, Thomas said if "valuable" was the source of the requirement that the minerals should have commercial worth, that would be inconsistent with ''Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc.'', because that decision said that a substance was a mineral when it could be used for commercial purposes. Thomas, in his opinion, disagreed with the conclusion of ''Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc.'' He did not agree that sand and gravel are minerals under the SRHA only because, hypothetically, "they could have been used for commercial purposes," when the SRHA was passed. Thomas agreed with the majority opinion that according to common sense and the statutory context sand and gravel could not be used for commercial purposes, when the Pittman Act was passed in 1919. Thomas wrote in his opinion that he did not advocate overruling ''Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc.'' despite disagreeing with the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/03pdf/02-1593.pdf |format =PDF |title =''BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United States'': THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment |pages =1–3 |date =31 March 2005 |access-date =11 February 2017 |website =Supreme Court of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dissenting opinion ===
[[File:John Paul Stevens, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg|thumb|140px|Justice [[John Paul Stevens|John P. Stevens]]]]
Justice John P. Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion, that was joined by Justices [[David Souter]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/03pdf/02-1593.pdf |format =PDF |title =''BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United States'': STEVENS, J., dissenting |page =1 |date =31 March 2005 |access-date =11 February 2017 |website =Supreme Court of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevens said the majority opinion depended entirely on the word "valuable", and he rejected this emphasis. He said the reservation of the Pittman Underground Water Act was meant to be the same as that of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act (SRHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/03pdf/02-1593.pdf |format =PDF |title =''BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United States'': STEVENS, J., dissenting |pages =2–3 |date =31 March 2005 |access-date =11 February 2017 |website =Supreme Court of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevens called it highly unlikely that Congress meant to make a distinction between the reservation of the Pittman Act and the one of the SRHA, as it would be illogical that Congress would have wanted a reservation to the sand and gravel in lands covered by the SRHA, but not to the sand and gravel in lands covered by the Pittman Act. Besides, Stevens referred to a House Committee Report which said section 8 of the Pittman Act contained the same reservation of minerals as the SRHA. Stevens criticized the majority opinion for ignoring the fact that ''Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc.'' already stated that a substance must be valuable to be a mineral. Moreover, he said "valuable minerals" and "minerals" were meant to be synonymous, as the Pittman Act contains the phrase "valuable minerals" twice and the words "minerals" and "mineral" without the word "valuable" eight times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/03pdf/02-1593.pdf |format =PDF |title =''BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United States'': STEVENS, J., dissenting |pages =1–3 |date =31 March 2005 |access-date =11 February 2017 |website =Supreme Court of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevens did not rule out the possibility that the majority opinion in ''Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc.'' misinterpreted Congress' intention, but he said there was no reason to choose another assessment of the Congress' intention over the old one. Stevens criticized the majority opinion for not using legislative history in order to find the Congress' original intent, which could result into decisions based on personal preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/03pdf/02-1593.pdf |format =PDF |title =''BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United States'': STEVENS, J., dissenting |page =3 |date =31 March 2005 |access-date =11 February 2017 |website =Supreme Court of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority argued looking at the legislative history was unnecessary because of the clear language of the Pittman Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url =http://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1250&amp;context=jesl |last =Hastings |first =Jay D. |access-date =11 March 2017 |volume =12 |number =2 |year =2005 |journal =[[Journal of Environmental and Sustainability Law]] |page =183 |title =BedRoc Ltd.. v.

The '''Bologna Declaration''' (in full, Joint Declaration of the European Ministers of Education convened in Bologna on 19 June 1999&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cepes.ro/services/inf_sources/on_line/bologna.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the main guiding document of the [[Bologna process]]. It was adopted by ministers of education of 29 European countries at their meeting in [[Bologna]] in 1999.

It proposed a [[European Higher Education Area]] in which students and graduates could move freely between countries, using prior qualifications in one country as acceptable entry requirements for further study in another.

The principal aims agreed were:

# "Adoption of a system of easily readable and comparable degrees".  That is to say, countries should adopt common terminology and standards
# "Adoption of a system essentially based on two main cycles, undergraduate and graduate. Access to the second cycle [graduate education] shall require successful completion of first cycle lasting a minimum of three years. The degree awarded after the first cycle shall also be relevant to the European labour market as an appropriate level of qualification. The second cycle should lead to the master and/or doctorate degree as in many European countries."

The [http://www.bologna-bergen2005.no Bergen meeting] subsequently refined the second point, and produced a three-cycle [https://web.archive.org/web/20080911042655/http://www.bologna-bergen2005.no/EN/BASIC/050520_Framework_qualifications.pdf framework of qualifications], which in the UK terminology (adopted, at least partially, by many European countries) would be Bachelor for a first degree of three years, Master  for subsequent study, and Doctor for a degree which has "made a contribution through original research that extends the frontier of knowledge by developing a substantial body of work".

The Bologna declaration has later been followed up a series of meetings between EU ministers. Each meeting has produced a communiqué based on their deliberations. To date these include the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928103200/http://www.bologna-bergen2005.no/Docs/00-Main_doc/010519PRAGUE_COMMUNIQUE.PDF Prague communiqué] (2001), the [http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/hogeronderwijs/bologna/documents/MDC/Berlin_Communique1.pdf Berlin communiqué] (2003), the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928103316/http://www.bologna-bergen2005.no/Docs/00-Main_doc/050520_Bergen_Communique.pdf Bergen communiqué] (2005), the [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100202100434/http://www.dfes.gov.uk/londonbologna/uploads/documents/LondonCommuniquefinalwithLondonlogo.pdf London communiqué] (2007)[https://web.archive.org/web/20070716222744/http://www.dfes.gov.uk/londonbologna/] the [http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/hogeronderwijs/bologna/conference/documents/Leuven_Louvain-la-Neuve_Communiqué_April_2009.pdf Leuven &amp; Louvain-la-Neuve communiqué] (2009).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/hogeronderwijs/bologna/conference/&lt;/ref&gt;

European Commission has published ( European Communities, Feb. 2009) an "ECTS Users’ Guide",&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/education/lifelong-learning-policy/doc/ects/guide_en.pdf "ECTS Users’ Guide"]&lt;/ref&gt; including one "Overview of national regulations (...)" and "Status of the proclamation".

The [http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/hogeronderwijs/bologna/2010_conference/ Bologna Ministerial Anniversary Conference 2010 in Budapest and Vienna] was held in March 2010. It issued the [http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/hogeronderwijs/bologna/2010_conference/documents/Budapest-Vienna_Declaration.pdf Budapest-Vienna Declaration].

The communiqués indicate that progress is being made towards the Bologna Declaration's aim of a [[European Higher Education Area]], however such an area is not universally accepted as being a desirable outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz on the Bologna Process.[http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/1871/11005/1/Sociologia%20Internationalis.pdf] Questions have also been posed, e.g. by Prof. Hauke Bronckhorst, as to the democratic legitimacy of the Bologna Process.[http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&amp;dig=2006/08/12/a0147]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Budapest-Vienna declaration, the next Ministerial Meeting was held in [[Bucharest]] on 26–27 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120505053644/http://www.ehea.info/Uploads/%281%29/Bucharest%20Communique%202012%281%29.pdf "Making the Most of Our Potential: Consolidating the European Higher Education Area - Bucharest Communiqué"]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Canadian Confederation sidebar}}
'''Canadian Confederation''' ({{lang-fr|Confédération canadienne}}) was the process by which the [[British colonization of the Americas#British colonies in North America|British colonies]] of [[Province of Canada|Canada]], [[Nova Scotia]], and [[New Brunswick]] were united into one [[Dominion]] of [[Canada]] on July 1, 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-1.html#h-3 |title=Constitution Act, 1867 | publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada | date=March 29, 1867 | accessdate=September 3, 2012| page=s.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=VelV-rBz24sC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=canadian+confederation&amp;ots=9ehm_J1pIQ&amp;sig=OUrb0p1EOgBNAk0QU8-6qKqyOsQ#v=onepage&amp;q=canadian%20confederation&amp;f=false | title=Britain and the Origins of Canadian Confederation, 1837–67 | publisher=University of British Columbia Press | author=Martin, Ged | year=1995 | location=Vancouver | pages=1 | isbn=978-0774804875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon confederation, the old province of Canada was divided into [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]; along with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the new federation thus comprised four provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-1.html#h-3 |title=Constitution Act, 1867 | publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada | date=March 29, 1867 | accessdate=September 3, 2012| page=s.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years since Confederation, Canada has seen numerous territorial changes and expansions, resulting in the current union of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-18.html#f6 |title=Constitution Act, 1867 | publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada | date=March 29, 1867 | accessdate=September 3, 2012| page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Canada is a [[federation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/sites/lop/aboutparliament/forsey/fed_state_01-e.asp |title=How Canadians Govern Themselves,. 7th ed |publisher=.parl.gc.ca |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not a confederate association of sovereign states, which "[[confederation]]" means in contemporary political theory.  It is nevertheless often considered to be among the world's more [[decentralization|decentralized]] federations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/aia/index.asp?lang=eng&amp;Page=archive&amp;Sub=speeches-discours&amp;Doc=19990422-eng.htm |title=Collaborative Federalism in an era of globalization |publisher=Pco-bcp.gc.ca |date=April 22, 1999 |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term ''Confederation'' arose in the Province of Canada to refer to proposals beginning in the 1850s to federate all of the British North American colonies, as opposed to only Canada West (Ontario) and Canada East (Quebec). To contemporaries of Confederation the ''con-'' prefix indicated a strengthening of the centrist principle compared to the American federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Waite |first=Peter B. |title=The Life and Times of Confederation, 1864–1867 |at=Pages 37–38, footnote 6 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |date=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this Canadian context, ''confederation'' generally describes the political process that united the colonies in the 1860s, related events and the subsequent incorporation of other colonies and territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Canada|title=Canadian Confederation|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/index-e.html|work=How Canada came to be|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is now often used to describe Canada in an abstract way, such as in "the [[Fathers of Confederation]]". Provinces and territories that became part of Canada after 1867 are also said to have [[#Joining Confederation|joined, or entered into, confederation]] (but not ''the Confederation'').&lt;ref name="Walker2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward W. Walker|title=Dissolution: sovereignty and the breakup of the Soviet Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y06eqVKtfQgC&amp;pg=PA174|date=May 1, 2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-2453-8|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to divide [[Canadian history]] into pre-Confederation (i.e. pre-1867) and post-Confederation (i.e. post-1867) periods.&lt;ref name="TaylorOwram1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Brook Taylor|author2=Doug Owram|title=Canadian History: Beginnings to Confederation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FamJrJEvymIC&amp;pg=PR13|date=May 17, 1994|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-6826-2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the [[Former colonies and territories in Canada|former colonies and territories]] that became involved in the Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, were initially part of [[New France]], and were once ruled by [[Early modern France|France]].&lt;ref name="DorinKaltemback2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jacques Dorin|author2=Michèle Kaltemback|author3=Sheryl Rahal|title=Canadian Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v2JgD5HcMMC&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate= February 20, 2012|year=2007|publisher=Presses Univ. du Mirail|isbn=978-2-85816-888-0|pages=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nova Scotia]] was granted in 1621 to [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|Sir William Alexander]] under [[charter]] by [[James VI (Scotland)|James VI]].&lt;ref name="DorinKaltemback2007"/&gt; This claim overlapped the French claims to [[Acadia]], and although the [[Scottish colonization of the Americas|Scottish colony]] of Nova Scotia was short-lived, for political reasons, the conflicting imperial interests of France and the 18th century [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] led to a long and bitter struggle for control. The British acquired present-day mainland Nova Scotia by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 and the Acadian population [[Great Upheaval|was expelled]] by the British in 1755. They called Acadia [[Nova Scotia]], which included present-day [[New Brunswick]].&lt;ref name="DorinKaltemback2007"/&gt; The rest of New France was acquired by the British by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], which ended the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]]. From 1763 to 1791, most of New France became the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]].&lt;ref name="DorinKaltemback2007"/&gt; However, in 1769 the present-day [[Prince Edward Island]], which had been part of Acadia, was renamed "St John's Island" and organized as a separate colony.&lt;ref name="Semple1996uy"/&gt; It was renamed "Prince Edward Island" in 1798 in honour of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]].&lt;ref name="Semple1996uy"&gt;{{cite book|author=Neil Semple|title=The Lord's Dominion: The History of Canadian Methodism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fkFoPvCCkfcC&amp;pg=PA460|date=April 16, 1996|publisher=McGill-Queens|isbn=978-0-7735-1400-3|page=460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[English colonial empire|English]] attempt at settlement had been in [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], which would not join Confederation until 1949.&lt;ref name="Hayes2006po"&gt;{{cite book|author=Derek Hayes|title=Historical Atlas of Canada: Canada's History Illustrated with Original Maps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KvtEUChw9uAC&amp;pg=PA212|date=August 31, 2006|publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre|isbn=978-1-55365-077-5|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Society of Merchant Venturers]] of [[Bristol]] began to settle [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] at [[Cuper's Cove]] as far back as 1610, and Newfoundland had also been the subject of a [[Plaisance, Newfoundland and Labrador|French colonial enterprise]].&lt;ref name="Clarke2010re"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sandra Clarke|title=Newfoundland and Labrador English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=moDVp5TTpgcC&amp;pg=PA5|date=April 1, 2010|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-2617-5|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the [[American Revolution]], an estimated 50,000 [[United Empire Loyalists]] fled to [[British North America]].&lt;ref name="DorinKaltemback2007"/&gt; The British created the separate colony of New Brunswick in 1784 for the Loyalists who settled in the western part of Nova Scotia.&lt;ref name="Hayes2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Derek Hayes|title=Historical Atlas of Canada: Canada's History Illustrated with Original Maps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KvtEUChw9uAC&amp;pg=PA127|date=August 31, 2006|publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre|isbn=978-1-55365-077-5|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Nova Scotia (including New Brunswick) received slightly more than half of this influx, many Loyalists also settled in the Province of Quebec, which by the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]] was separated into a predominantly English [[Upper Canada]] and a predominantly French [[Lower Canada]].&lt;ref name="FrancisFrancis2009a"&gt;{{cite book|author1=R.

[[File:Canada provinces 1867-1870.png|left|thumb|Canadian Territory at Confederation]]

Following the [[Rebellions of 1837]], [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] in his [[Durham Report]], recommended that Upper and Lower Canada be joined as the [[Province of Canada]] and that the new province should have a [[responsible government]].&lt;ref name="MatthewsGentilcore1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey J.

In the following years, the British would extend responsible government to Prince Edward Island (1851), New Brunswick (1854), and [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] (1855).&lt;ref name="Careless2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

The area which constitutes modern-day [[British Columbia]] is the remnants of the Hudson's Bay Company's [[Columbia District]] and [[New Caledonia District]] following the [[Oregon Treaty]]. Prior to joining Canada in 1871, British Columbia consisted of the separate [[Colony of British Columbia]] (formed in 1858, in an area where the Crown had previously granted a monopoly to the Hudson's Bay Company), and the [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] (formed in 1849) constituting a separate [[crown colony]] until it was united with the colony of British Columbia in 1866.&lt;ref name="Whitaker1874"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mercantile Library Association (San Francisco, Calif.)|author2=Alfred Edward Whitaker|title=Catalogue of the library of the Mercantile library association of San Francisco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZI1AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA106|year=1874|publisher=Francis &amp; Valentine, printers|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of modern-day Canada was made up of [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] (both of which were controlled by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and sold to Canada in 1870) and the [[Arctic Islands (Canada)|Arctic Islands]], which were under direct British control and became a part of Canada in 1880.&lt;ref name="Emmerson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Emmerson|title=The Future History of the Arctic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D8W8ZZcIQrwC&amp;pg=PA73|date=March 2, 2010|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-636-5|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early attempts===
[[File:George etiene cartier.jpg|thumb|alt=|[[George-Étienne Cartier]] ]]

The idea of unification was presented in 1839 by [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] in his [[Report on the Affairs of British North America]],&lt;ref name="KaufmanMacpherson2005tg"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Will Kaufman|author2=Heidi Slettedahl Macpherson|title=Britain and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HbBbn3x7PZsC&amp;pg=PA822|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-431-8|page=822}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the [[Act of Union 1840|Union]] of Upper and Lower Canada. Beginning in 1857, [[Joseph-Charles Taché]] proposed a federation in a series of 33 articles published in the ''Courrier du Canada''.&lt;ref name="Waite2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter B. Waite|title=The life and times of Confederation, 1864–1867: politics, newspapers, and the union of British North America|year=2001|publisher=Robin Brass Studio|isbn=978-1-896941-23-3|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, [[Alexander Tilloch Galt]], [[George-Étienne Cartier]] and [[John Ross (Canadian senator)|John Ross]] travelled to [[Great Britain]] to present the British Parliament with a project for confederation of the British colonies. The proposal was received by the [[London]] authorities with polite indifference. By 1864, it was clear that continued governance of the Province of Canada under the terms of the 1840 [[Act of Union (1840)|Act of Union]] had become impracticable. Therefore, a [[Great Coalition]] of parties formed in order to reform the political system.&lt;ref&gt;Waite, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences leading to Confederation===
There were several factors that influenced Confederation, both caused from internal sources and pressures from external sources.&lt;ref name="Martin1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ged Martin|title=Britain and the origins of Canadian confederation, 1837–67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMFD-xFOuaoC&amp;pg=PA115|year=1995|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-0487-5|pages=23–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ged Martin|title=The Causes of Canadian confederation|pages=12–24|year=1990|publisher=Acadiensis Press|isbn=978-0-919107-25-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Smith, British Businessmen and Canadian Confederation Constitution-Making in an Era of Anglo-Globalization (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
;Internal causes that influenced Confederation:
* political deadlock resulting from the current political structure
* demographic pressure (population expansion)
* economic nationalism and the promise of economic development

===Ideological origins and philosophical dimensions===
[[File:Map of the Eastern British Provinces in North America at the time of Confederation 1867.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Eastern British Provinces in North America at the time of Canadian Confederation, 1867.]]
There is extensive scholarly debate on the role of political ideas in Canadian Confederation. Traditionally, historians regarded Canadian Confederation an exercise in political pragmatism that was essentially non-ideological. In the 1960s, historian [[Peter Busby Waite|Peter Waite]] derided the references to political philosophers in the legislative debates on Confederation as "hot air". In Waite's view, Confederation was driven by pragmatic brokerage politics and competing interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;See Introduction by Ged Martin in Peter B. Waite, The Confederation Debates in the Province of Canada, 1865 A Selection (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, political scientist Peter&amp;nbsp;J. Smith challenged the view that Canadian Confederation was non-ideological. Smith argued that Confederation was motivated by new political ideologies as much as the American and French Revolutions and that Canadian Confederation was driven by a [[Court Party]] ideology. Smith traces the origins of this ideology to eighteenth and nineteenth-century Britain, where political life was polarized between defenders of [[Classical republicanism|classical republican]] values of the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] and proponents of a new pro-capitalist ideology of the Court Party, which believed in centralizing political power. In British North America in the late 1860s, the Court Party tradition was represented by the supporters of Confederation, whereas the anti-capitalist and agrarian Country Party tradition was embodied by the Anti-Confederates.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peter J. 1987. "The Ideological Origins of Canadian Confederation". Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue Canadienne De Science Politique. 20, no. 1: 3–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2000 journal article, historian [[Ian McKay (historian)|Ian McKay]] argued that Canadian Confederation was motivated by the ideology of liberalism and the belief in the supremacy of individual rights. McKay described Confederation as part of the classical liberal project of creating a "liberal order" in northern North America.&lt;ref&gt;Mckay, I. 2000. "The Liberal Order Framework: A Prospectus for a Reconnaissance of Canadian History". CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW. 81: 617–645.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Canadian historians have adopted McKay's liberal order framework as a paradigm for understanding Canadian history.&lt;ref&gt;Ducharme, Michel, and Jean-François Constant. Liberalism and Hegemony: Debating the Canadian Liberal Revolution. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, historian Andrew Smith advanced a very different view of Confederation’s ideological origins. He argues that in the four original Canadian provinces, the politics of taxation were a central issue in the debate about Confederation.  Taxation was also central to the debate in Newfoundland, the tax-averse colony that rejected it. Smith argued Confederation was supported by many colonists who were sympathetic to a relatively interventionist, or statist, approach to capitalist development. Most classical liberals, who believed in free trade and low taxes, opposed Confederation because they feared that it would result in Big Government. The struggle over Confederation involved a battle between a staunchly individualist economic philosophy and a comparatively collectivist view of the state’s proper role in the economy. According to Smith, the victory of the [[Statism|statist]] supporters of Confederation over their [[anti-statist]] opponents prepared the way for Sir John A. Macdonald’s government to enact the protectionist National Policy and to subsidize major infrastructure projects such as the [[Intercolonial Railway|Intercolonial]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Pacific]] Railways.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Andrew. 2008. "Toryism, Classical Liberalism, and Capitalism: The Politics of Taxation and the Struggle for Canadian Confederation". The Canadian Historical Review. 89, no. 1: 1–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, political scientist Janet Ajzenstat connected Canadian Confederation to the individualist ideology of [[John Locke]]. She argued that the union of the British North American colonies was motivated by a desire to protect individual rights, especially the rights to life, liberty, and property. She contends that the Fathers of Confederation were motivated by the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. She argues that their intellectual debts to Locke are most evident when one looks at the 1865 debates in the Province of Canada’s legislature on whether or not union with the other British North American colonies would be desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Ajzenstat, Janet.

===Charlottetown Conference===
{{Main|Charlottetown Conference}}
In the spring of 1864, [[List of premiers of New Brunswick|New Brunswick premier]] [[Samuel Leonard Tilley]], [[List of premiers of Nova Scotia|Nova Scotia premier]] [[Charles Tupper]], and [[List of premiers of Prince Edward Island|Prince Edward Island premier]] [[John Hamilton Gray (Prince Edward Island politician)|John Hamilton Gray]] were contemplating the idea of a [[Maritime Union]] which would join their three colonies together.&lt;ref&gt;Waite, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charlottetown Conference Delegates, September 1864.JPG|left|thumb|Delegates of the [[Charlottetown Conference]] on the steps of [[Government House (Prince Edward Island)|Government House]], September 1864.]]

The [[List of Joint Premiers of the Province of Canada|Premier of the Province of Canada]] [[John A. Macdonald]] surprised the Atlantic premiers by asking if the Province of Canada could be included in the negotiations.  The request was channelled through the Governor-General, Monck, to London and accepted by the Colonial Office.&lt;ref name="Gwyn2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Gwyn|title=John A: The Man Who Made Us|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xN7jXe0H5FwC&amp;pg=PP1|date=October 28, 2008|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-679-31476-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several years of legislative paralysis in the Province of Canada caused by the need to maintain a double legislative majority (a majority of both the Canada East and Canada West delegates in the Province of Canada’s legislature), Macdonald had led his [[Liberal-Conservative Party]] into the [[Great Coalition]] with [[George-Étienne Cartier]]’s [[Parti bleu]] and [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]]’s [[Clear Grits]].&lt;ref name="Careless2012oij"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. M. S. Careless|title=Canada: A Story of Challenge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mARx1-EGwR0C&amp;pg=PA233|date=January 26, 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-67581-0|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macdonald, Cartier, and Brown felt that union with the other British colonies might be a way to solve the political problems of the Province of Canada.&lt;ref name="Careless2012oij"/&gt;

The [[Charlottetown Conference]] began on September 1, 1864. Since the agenda for the meeting had already been set, the delegation from the Province of Canada was initially not an official part of the Conference. The issue of Maritime Union was deferred and the [[Canadians]] were formally allowed to join and address the Conference.&lt;ref&gt;Waite, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

No minutes from the Charlottetown Conference survive, but we do know that George-Étienne Cartier and John A. Macdonald presented arguments in favour of a union of the three colonies;&lt;ref name="Gwyn, p. 304"&gt;Gwyn, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Tilloch Galt]] presented the Province of Canada’s proposals on the financial arrangements of such a union;&lt;ref name="Gwyn, p. 304"/&gt; and that George Brown presented a proposal for what form a united government might take.&lt;ref name="Waite, p. 87"&gt;Waite, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian delegation’s proposal for the governmental system involved:
# preservation of ties with Great Britain;
# residual jurisdiction left to a central authority;
# a bicameral system including a Lower House with representation by population (rep by pop) and an Upper House with representation based on regional, rather than provincial, equality;
# responsible government at the federal and provincial levels;
# the appointment of a [[governor general]] by the [[British Crown]].

Other proposals attractive to the politicians from the Maritime colonies were:
# assumption of provincial debt by the central government;&lt;ref name="Waite, p. 85"&gt;Waite, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;
# revenues from the central government apportioned to the provinces on the basis of population;&lt;ref name="Waite, p. 85"/&gt;
# the building of an intercolonial railway to link Montreal and Halifax, giving Canada access to an ice-free winter port and the Maritimes easy access to Canada and [[Rupert's Land]].&lt;ref&gt;Gwyn, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

By September 7, 1864, the delegates from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island gave a positive answer to the Canadian delegation, expressing the view that the federation of all of the provinces was considered desirable if the terms of union could be made satisfactory&lt;ref&gt;Gwyn, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; and the question of Maritime Union was waived.&lt;ref name="Waite, p. 87"/&gt;

After the Conference adjourned on September 9, there were further meetings between delegates held at [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], and [[Fredericton]].&lt;ref&gt;Waite, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwyn, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; These meetings evinced enough interest that it was decided to hold a second Conference.
[[File:ThomasDArcyMcGee.jpg|right|thumb|Thomas D'Arcy McGee in 1868]]

====Delegates' reactions====

One of the most important purposes of the Charlottetown Conference was the introduction of Canadians to the leaders from the Maritime Provinces and vice versa.  At this point there was no railway link from Quebec City to Halifax, and the people of each region had little to do with one another.  [[D'Arcy McGee]] was one of the few Canadian delegates who had been to the Maritimes, when he had gone down earlier that summer with a trade mission of Canadian businessmen, journalists and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Gwy, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

George Brown remarked in a letter to his wife Anne that at a party given by the premier of PEI, Colonel [[John Hamilton Gray (Prince Edward Island politician)|John Hamilton Gray]], he met a woman who had never been off the island in her entire life.  Nevertheless, he found [[Prince Edward Island]]ers to be "amazingly civilized".&lt;ref&gt;cited in Gwyn, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

====Press and popular reaction====

Reaction to the Charlottetown Conference varied among the different newspapers.  In the Maritimes there was concern that the smooth Canadians with their sparkling champagne and charming speeches were outsmarting the delegates of the smaller provinces.  "From all accounts it looks as if these [Canadian] gentlemen had it all their own way; ... and that, what with their arguments and what with their blandishments, (they gave a champagne lunch on board the ''Victoria'' where Mr. McGee's wit sparkled brightly as the wine), they carried the Lower Province delegates a little off their feet."&lt;ref&gt;Fredericton ''Head Quarters'', of September 14, 1864, cited in Waite, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quebec Conference===
{{Main|Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Resolutions}}

After returning home from the Charlottetown Conference, John A. Macdonald asked [[Charles Monck, 4th Viscount Monck|Viscount Monck]], the [[List of Governors General of Canada|Governor General of the Province of Canada]] to invite delegates from the three Maritime provinces and [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] to a conference with United Canada delegates. Monck obliged and the Conference went ahead at [[Quebec City]] in October 1864.

[[File:QuebecConvention1864.jpg|thumb|left|Delegates at the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]], October 1864.]]

The Conference began on October 10, 1864, on the site of present-day Montmorency Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quebec400.gc.ca/histoires-stories/parc-montmorency-park-eng.cfm |title=Quebec 2008 (400th Anniversary website), Government of Canada |publisher=Quebec400.gc.ca |date=November 8, 2007 |accessdate=May 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506011800/http://www.quebec400.gc.ca/histoires-stories/parc-montmorency-park-eng.cfm |archivedate=May 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conference elected [[Étienne-Paschal Taché]] as its chairman, but it was dominated by Macdonald.  Despite differences in the positions of some of the delegates on some issues, the Quebec Conference, following so swiftly on the success of the Charlottetown Conference, was infused with a determinative sense of purpose and [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Waite, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;  For the Reformers of Canada West, led by George Brown, the end of what they perceived as French-Canadian interference in local affairs was in sight.&lt;ref name="Waite, p. 99"&gt;Waite, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;  For Maritimers such as Tupper of Nova Scotia or Tilley of New Brunswick, horizons were suddenly broadened to take in much larger possibilities for trade and growth.&lt;ref name="Waite, p. 99"/&gt;

On the issue of the Senate, the Maritime Provinces pressed for as much equality as possible.  With the addition of Newfoundland to the Conference, the other three Maritime colonies did not wish to see the strength of their provinces in the upper chamber diluted by simply adding Newfoundland to the Atlantic category.&lt;ref&gt;Waite, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the matter of the Senate that threatened to derail the entire proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Gwyn p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;  It was Macdonald who came up with the acceptable compromise of giving Newfoundland four senators of its own when it joined.&lt;ref name="Gwyn"&gt;Gwyn, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;

The delegates from the Maritimes also raised an issue with respect to the level of government—federal or provincial—that would be given the powers not otherwise specifically defined.  Macdonald, who was aiming for the strongest central government possible, insisted that this was to be the central government, and in this he was supported by, among others, Tupper.&lt;ref&gt;Waite, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the Conference, it adopted the [[Seventy-two Resolutions]] which would form the basis of a scheduled future conference. The Conference adjourned on October 27.

Prince Edward Island emerged disappointed from the Quebec Conference.  It did not receive support for a guarantee of six members in the proposed House of Commons, and was denied an appropriation of $200,000 that it felt had been offered at [[Charlottetown]] to assist in [[Land Purchase Act (1875)|buying out the holdings of absentee landlords]].&lt;ref&gt;Waite, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

====Press and popular reaction====

"Never was there such an opportunity as now for the birth of a nation" proclaimed a pamphlet written by S. E. Dawson and reprinted in a Quebec City newspaper during the Conference.&lt;ref name="Gwyn" /&gt;

Again, reaction to the Quebec Conference varied depending on the political views of the critic.

==== Constitutional scheme discussed in London====

George Brown was the first to carry the constitutional proposals to the British Government in London in December 1864, where it gave "a most gracious answer to our constitutional scheme."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mackenzie |first=Alexander |title= The Life and Speeches of Hon. George Brown |at=Page 230 |publisher=The Globe Printing Company |date=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also met with William Gladstone, who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer and later prime minister, "who agreed in almost everything."&lt;ref&gt;cited in Mackenzie, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 1865, Brown, Macdonald, Cartier and Galt met with the Imperial Government where "The project of a federal union of the colonies was highly approved of by the Imperial authorities."&lt;ref&gt;cited in Mackenzie, p. 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;

===The London Conference===
{{Main|London Conference of 1866}}
[[File:Queen Victoria 1887.jpg|thumb|left|[[Queen Victoria]] granted [[royal assent]] to the [[British North America Act]] on March 29, 1867]]

Following the Quebec Conference, the Province of Canada's legislature passed a bill approving the union. The union proved more controversial in the Maritime provinces, however, and it was not until 1866 that New Brunswick and Nova Scotia passed union resolutions, while Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland continued to opt against joining.

In December 1866, sixteen delegates from the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia travelled to London, where the [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|4th Earl of Carnarvon]] presented each to [[Queen Victoria]] in private [[Audience (meeting)|audience]],&lt;ref name="Lady Carnarvon"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ladycarnarvon.com/a-constitutional-walk-for-canada-day/|title=A Constitutional Walk for Canada Day|date=2017-06-30|work=Lady Carnarvon|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as holding court for their wives and daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Bousfield| first=Arthur|author2=Toffoli, Garry| title=Royal Observations| publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd.| year=1991| location=Toronto| page=16| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z0tRpB891bIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=toffoli&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false| isbn=1-55002-076-5| accessdate=March 7, 2010| ref=CITEREFBousfield1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; At meetings held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, the delegates reviewed and approved the 72 resolutions; although Charles Tupper had promised anti-union forces in Nova Scotia that he would push for amendments, he was unsuccessful in getting any passed. Now known as the ''London Resolutions'', the conference's decisions were forwarded to the [[Colonial Office]].

After breaking for Christmas, the delegates reconvened in January 1867 and began drafting the [[British North America Act]]. The 4th Earl of Carnarvon continued to have a central role in drafting the Act at [[Highclere Castle]] alongside the first [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[John A. Macdonald]], [[George-Étienne Cartier]] and [[Alexander Tilloch Galt]], who signed the visitor book in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ladycarnarvon.com/community/highclere-and-canada/|title=Community Category: Highclere and Canada|website=Lady Carnarvon|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After suggestions of 'Franklin' and 'Guelfenland',&lt;ref name="Lady Carnarvon"/&gt; they agreed that the new country should be called ''Canada'', that Canada East should be renamed ''Quebec'' and that Canada West should be renamed ''Ontario''.&lt;ref name="OlsonShadle1996oi"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson|author2=Robert Shadle|title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0VnzMelzm8C&amp;pg=PA916|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29367-2|page=916}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was, however, heated debate about how the new country should be designated. Ultimately, the delegates elected to call the new country the Dominion of Canada, after "kingdom" and "confederation", among other options, were rejected for various reasons. The term ''dominion'' was allegedly suggested by Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley.&lt;ref name="Rayburn2001qwe"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Rayburn|title=Naming Canada: Stories About Canadian Place Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aiUZMOypNB4C&amp;pg=PA18|date=March 1, 2001|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8293-0|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The delegates had completed their draft of the British North America Act by February 1867. The Act was presented to Queen Victoria on February 11, 1867. The bill was introduced in the [[House of Lords]] the next day. The bill was quickly approved by the House of Lords, and then also quickly approved by the [[British House of Commons]]. (The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] was [[prime minister of the United Kingdom]] at the time.) The Act received [[royal assent]] on March 29, 1867, and set July 1, 1867, as the date for union.&lt;ref name="Moore2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Christopher Moore (Canadian historian)|Christopher Moore]]|title=1867: How the Fathers Made a Deal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmgBsaRJbTQC&amp;pg=PT159|date=July 27, 2011|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-1-55199-483-3|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British North America Acts===
{{main|British North America Acts}}
[[File:Proclamation Canadian Confederation.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of Canadian Confederation]]
[[Confederation]] was accomplished when the Queen gave royal assent to the British North America Act (BNA Act) on March 29, 1867, followed by a royal proclamation stating: "We do ordain, declare, and command that on and after the First day of July, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Sixty-seven, the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, shall form and be One Dominion, under the name of Canada."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bousfield|1991|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; That act, which united the Province of Canada with the colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, came into effect on July 1 that year. The act replaced the [[Act of Union (1840)]] which had previously unified [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]] into the united [[Province of Canada]]. Separate provinces were re-established under their current names of Ontario and Quebec. July 1 is now celebrated as a [[public holiday]], [[Canada Day]], the country's official [[National Day]].

The form of the country's government was influenced by the [[United States|American republic]] to the south. Noting the flaws perceived in the American system, the Fathers of Confederation opted to retain a monarchical form of government.  [[John A. Macdonald]], speaking in 1865 about the proposals for the upcoming confederation of Canada, said:

{{quote|By adhering to the monarchical principle we avoid one defect inherent in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]]. By the election of the president by a majority and for a short period, he never is the sovereign and chief of the nation. He is never looked up to by the whole people as the head and front of the nation. He is at best but the successful leader of a party. This defect is all the greater on account of the practice of reelection. During his first term of office he is employed in taking steps to secure his own reelection, and for his party a continuance of power. We avoid this by adhering to the monarchical principle—the sovereign whom you respect and love. I believe that it is of the utmost importance to have that principle recognized so that we shall have a sovereign who is placed above the region of party—to whom all parties look up; who is not elevated by the action of one party nor depressed by the action of another; who is the common head and sovereign of all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/268/5/1.html |title=Macdonald, John A.; '&amp;#39;On Canadian Confederation'&amp;#39;; 1865 |publisher=Bartleby.com |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Macdonald]] had spoken of  "founding a great British monarchy" and wanted the newly created country to be called the "Kingdom of Canada".&lt;ref&gt;Farthing, John; ''Freedom Wears a Crown''; Toronto, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; Although it had its [[Monarchy in Canada|monarch]] in London, the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Office]] opposed as "premature" and "pretentious" the term "kingdom", as it was felt it might antagonize the United States. The term ''[[dominion]]'' was chosen to indicate Canada's status as a self-governing polity of the British Empire, the first time it was used in reference to a country.

While the BNA Act eventually resulted in Canada having more autonomy than it had before, it was far from full independence from the United Kingdom. According to the Supreme Court of Canada, Canadian "sovereignty was acquired in the period between its separate signature of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 and the Statute of Westminster, 1931" long after Confederation in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/4737/index.do |title=Reference Re: Offshore Mineral Rights |year=1967 |publisher=[[Supreme Court of Canada]] |location=Ottawa |page=816}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defence of British North America became a Canadian responsibility.&lt;ref name="Dyck2011b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rand Dyck|title=Canadian Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUOoN8e5Ps0C&amp;pg=PA106|date=March 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-17-650343-7|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign policy remained in British hands, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] remained Canada's highest court of appeal, and the constitution could be amended only in Britain. Gradually, Canada gained more autonomy, and in 1931, obtained almost full autonomy within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] with the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]]. Because the provinces of Canada were unable to agree on a constitutional amending formula, this power remained with the British Parliament. In 1982, the constitution was [[patriation|patriated]] when [[Elizabeth II]] gave her royal assent to the [[Canada Act 1982]]. The [[Constitution of Canada]] is made up of a number of codified acts and uncodified traditions; one of the principal documents is the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], which renamed the BNA Act 1867 to [[Constitution Act, 1867]].&lt;ref name="Okafọ2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nọnso Okafọ|title=Reconstructing law and justice in a postcolony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Y_8IkfVCesC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=February 20, 2012|date=October 22, 2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-4784-3|pages=76–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominion elections were held in August and September to elect the first [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]], and the four new provinces' governments recommended the 72 individuals (24 each for Quebec and Ontario, 12 each for New Brunswick and Nova Scotia) who would sit in the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]].&lt;ref name="Chambers's encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chambers's encyclopaedia: a dictionary of universal knowledge for the people|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pv9BAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA225|year=1887|publisher=Collier|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Confederation Party won 18 out of 19 federal Nova Scotia seats in September 1867, and in the Nova Scotia provincial election of 1868, 36 out of 38 seats in the legislature. For seven years, William Annand and Joseph Howe led the ultimately unsuccessful fight to convince British imperial authorities to release Nova Scotia from Confederation. The government was vocally against Confederation, contending that it was no more than the annexation of the province to the pre-existing province of Canada.&lt;ref name="FrancisFrancis2009d"&gt;{{cite book|author1=R.

Prior to the coming into effect of the Constitution Act, 1867 there had been some concern regarding a potential "legislative vacuum" that would occur over the 15-month period between the prorogation of the Province of Canada's final Parliament in August 1866 and the opening of the now Dominion of Canada's first Parliament in November 1867. To prevent this, the Constitution Act, 1867 provided for "continuance of existing laws" from the three colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick until new laws could be established in the Dominion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-7.html#h-27 |title=Constitution Act, 1867 |year=1867 |publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada |location=Ottawa |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the "Dominion's financial systems, structures and actors were able to operate under the provisions of the old Province of Canada Acts" following confederation, and many institutions and organizations were continued and assumed "the same responsibilities for the new federal government that it had held as a provincial organization".&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baker |first=Ron |last2=Rennie |first2=Morina |year=2012 |title=An institutional perspective on the development of Canada’s first public accounts |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1032373212463270 |journal=Accounting History |publisher=Sage |publication-place=University of Regina / University of Guelph |volume=18 |issue=1 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fathers of Confederation==
{{main|Fathers of Confederation}}
[[File:Fathers of Confederation LAC c001855.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|1885 photo of [[Robert Harris (painter)|Robert Harris]]' 1884 painting, ''Conference at Quebec in 1864, to settle the basics of a union of the British North American Provinces'', also known as ''The Fathers of Confederation''. The original painting was destroyed in the 1916 Parliament Buildings Centre Block fire. The scene is an amalgamation of the [[Charlottetown Conference|Charlottetown]] and [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec City conference]] sites and attendees.]]
The original Fathers of Confederation are those delegates who attended any of the conferences held at Charlottetown and Quebec in 1864, or in London, United Kingdom, in 1866, leading to Confederation.&lt;ref name="MalcolmsonMyers2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrick Malcolmson|author2=Richard Myers|title=The Canadian Regime: An Introduction to Parliamentary Government in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-jpXFH_ZhY8C&amp;pg=PA7|date=August 15, 2009|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-0047-8|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 36 original Fathers of Confederation. [[Hewitt Bernard]], who was the recording secretary at the Charlottetown Conference, is considered by some to be a Father of Confederation.&lt;ref name="HarrisonOliver2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Alexander Harrison|author2=Peter Oliver|author3=Osgoode Society for Canadian Legal History|title=The conventional man: the diaries of Ontario Chief Justice Robert A.

In this way, [[Amor De Cosmos]] who was instrumental both in bringing democracy to British Columbia and in bringing his province into Confederation, is considered by many to be a Father of Confederation.&lt;ref name="Frances2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanford, Frances|title=Canada's Confederation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1sSWIvvW0mIC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2002|publisher=S&amp;S Learning Materials|isbn=978-1-55035-708-0|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, [[Joey Smallwood]] referred to himself as "the Last Father of Confederation", because he helped lead Newfoundland into Confederation in 1949.&lt;ref name="McCreery2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher McCreery|title=The Order of Canada: its origins, history, and development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4f_dQFXQpVkC&amp;pg=PA168|year=2005|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-3940-8|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joining Confederation==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Provinces and territories of Canada]] --&gt;
After the initial Act of Union in 1867, [[Manitoba]] was established by an Act of the Canadian Parliament on July 15, 1870, originally as an area of land much smaller than the current province.&lt;ref name="Sprague1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas N.

The Crown acquired [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1869 (though final payment to the Hudson's Bay Company did not occur until 1870), and then transferred jurisdiction to the Dominion on July 15, 1870, merging them and naming them [[North-West Territories]].&lt;ref name="Dominion Lands Policy"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dominion Lands Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BagO6FRx6I0C&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=February 20, 2012|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP|pages=1–|id=GGKEY:ND80W0QRBQN|date=January 15, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, the British assigned all North American [[Arctic]] islands to Canada, right up to [[Ellesmere Island]].&lt;ref name="Diubaldo1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard J.

Later, the third territory of [[Nunavut]] was carved from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999.&lt;ref name="DahlHicks2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jens Dahl|author2=Jack Hicks|author3=Peter Jull|author4=International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs|title=Nunavut: Inuit regain control of their lands and their lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wm-yttszFTMC&amp;pg=PA20|year=2000|publisher=IWGIA|isbn=978-87-90730-34-5|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At formal events, representatives of the provinces and territories take [[Canadian order of precedence|precedence according to this ordering]], except that provinces always precede territories.

==Legacy==
The term Confederation has entered into Canadian parlance both as a metaphor for the country and for the historical events that created it.  It has therefore become one of the most common names for Canadian landmarks.  Examples include [[Mount Confederation]], [[Confederation Square]], [[Confederation Building (disambiguation)|Confederation Building]], [[Confederation Park (disambiguation)|Confederation Park]], [[Confederation Station (OC Transpo)|Confederation Station]], [[Confederation Heights]], [[Confederation Bridge]], and so on.  This is similar to the American practices of naming things "Union" and likewise the Australians with "Federation".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1787">'''Catasto''' is the [[Italy|Italian]] system of [[land registration]]. The register itself is maintained at a local level by the individual councils or ''Comuni''. The data held in the '''Catasto''' is the basis for the ICI council property [[tax]] (''[[Imposta Comunale sugli Immobili]]'').

There are several companies which offer easy search facilities to draw [[data]] from the various Italian local councils. This information can be used to understand the property holdings of individuals or companies and the charges (''e.g.'' [[mortgages]]) which might be held over their ownership.

The [[Florence|Florentine]] Catasto of 1427 provided an important source of raw historical data for historians of the [[Renaissance]]. The extensive surveys conducted by Florentine officials reveal changing forms of social organization over the period that records were collected. [[David Herlihy]] and [[Christiane Klapisch-Zuber]]'s work on these records, ''Tuscans and Their Families'' is one of the first historical works to make use of computer-assisted statistical analysis.

He has attracted criticism from other broad left critics who regard his knowledge of [[feminist]], indigenous and [[LGBT]] politics to be insignificant, particularly insofar as their own distributive justice dimensions are concerned &lt;ref&gt;http://www.norightturn.blogspot.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gaynz.com/blog/redqueen |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829054049/http://gaynz.com/blog/redqueen/ |archive-date=29 August 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trotter is the author of ''No Left Turn'', a political history of New Zealand.&lt;ref name="nlt"&gt;{{cite book | title=No Left Turn: The Distortion of New Zealand's History by Greed, Bigotry, and Right-Wing Politics| url=https://www.amazon.com/No-Left-Turn-Distortion-Right-Wing/dp/1869418093/| last=Trotter| first=Chris| year=2007| publisher=Random House| location=New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist, poet and critic [[C K Stead]] described the book as "a dashingly written and persuasive elegy for the Scandinavian-style socialist democracy New Zealand might have been, and at the same time a realistic (though at times appropriately angry) acknowledgement that, given the forces, internal and external, ranged against it, the chances of it happening, and lasting, were never very good."&lt;ref name="ckstead"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Our Favourite Things| journal=Dominion Post| date=8 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, he said that [[Helen Clark]] should stand down before the [[New Zealand general election, 2008|election]] and be replaced by [[Phil Goff]], who he thought may have been Labour's only hope of regaining ground with struggling families. He has since recanted, arguing that Goff should have stood down in his turn before the [[New Zealand general election, 2011]], arguing that [[David Cunliffe]] should replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/282462|title=Labour poll-axed |date=23 February 2008|work=The Dominion Post |accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bowalleyroad.com/2010/08/leader-labour-needs-to-have.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Trotter joined the Free Speech Coalition, a group of former politicians, lawyers, journalists, and academics that pursued legal action against the [[Mayor of Auckland]] [[Phil Goff]] for denying [[Auckland Council]] facilities to two Canadian [[alt-right]] activists [[Lauren Southern]] and [[Stefan Molyneux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Free Speech Coalition website |url=https://freespeechcoalition.nz/ |publisher=Free Speech Coalition |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Free Speech Coalition on details of legal action |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1807/S00202/free-speech-coalition-on-details-of-legal-action.htm |accessdate=5 August 2018 |work=Free Speech Coalition |publisher=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop]] |date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Truebridge |first1=Nick |title=Free speech group raises $50k to challenge Auckland Council over far-Right speaker ban |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/105377682/free-speech-group-raises-50k-to-challenge-auckland-council-over-farright-speaker-ban |accessdate=5 August 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trotter justified his defense of the two alt-right activists' free speech by arguing that left-wing opponents of the tour lacked the courage to debate the alt-right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Trotter |first1=Chris |title=Do We Really Lack the Courage to Debate the Alt-Right?

The '''Christian Heritage Party of Canada''' ({{lang-fr|Parti de l'héritage chrétien du Canada}}), also referred to as '''CHP Canada''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=pol&amp;document=index&amp;dir=par&amp;lang=e&amp;textonly=false#CHP|title=Elections Canada Online - Registered Political Parties and Parties Eligible for Registration|work=elections.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[minor party|minor]] [[social conservatism|social]] and [[fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservative]] [[List of federal political parties in Canada|federal political party]] in Canada, founded in 1987. CHP advocates for Canada to be governed according to [[Biblical law in Christianity|Biblical law]]. The party's stated principle is that "the purpose of civil government is to ensure security, freedom, and justice for all its citizens from conception till natural death, by upholding just laws".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chp.ca/en/policy/principles.html |title=Christian Heritage Party of Canada Guiding Principles |publisher=Chp.ca |date=January 18, 2013 |accessdate=March 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503161149/http://www.chp.ca/en/policy/principles.html |archivedate=May 3, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; CHP states that, if the party forms government, it hopes to "apply proven [[Judeo-Christian]] principles of justice and compassion to Canada's contemporary public policy needs".&lt;ref name="chp.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chp.ca/en/party/about.html |title=About the CHP |publisher=Chp.ca |date=January 18, 2013 |accessdate=March 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922235407/http://www.chp.ca/en/party/about.html |archivedate=September 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ed Vanwoudenberg]] was elected its first leader at the 1987 founding convention in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. [[Christian Heritage Party candidates, multiple elections#Jim Hnatiuk|Jim Hnatiuk]] led the party from 2008 to early 2014, and Rod Taylor is the leader as of November 7, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Freston. ''Protestant political parties: a global survey''  (2004) p 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The party nominated candidates for the first time in the [[Canadian federal election, 1988|1988 federal election]], and ran numerous candidates in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993]] and [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 elections]]. It was unable to field 50 candidates in the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 election]] and was consequently de-registered by [[Elections Canada]], the government elections agency. The party was re-registered in time for the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 election]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Many of its founders had been members of the [[Canadian social credit movement|Social Credit]] movement.

== National leader ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
* Rod Taylor, national leader

The Christian Heritage Party selects its leader at a leadership convention, with voting power to party members in attendance at the convention.  If there is only one candidate (as in 2014), the person is not acclaimed, but rather is ratified as leader by a yes/no vote among the voting members.  Leadership conventions have been held in 1987, 1991, 1994, 1995, 2008 and 2014.  The national convention also elects national table officers (president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer); provincial presidents are elected in their respective provinces to represent those provinces on the national board.

==Party leaders==

===Edward John Vanwoudenberg (November 1987 – 1991)===
Vanwoudenberg was head of the CHP from the party's founding convention in 1987&lt;ref name="Canwest"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.canada.com/topics/news/features/decisioncanada/story.html?id=9148553e-2fc9-4bba-aa5c-0fb47f51d4d7|title=Decision Canada '08|date=September 17, 2008|publisher=[[Canwest News Service]]|accessdate=June 8, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927062435/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/features/decisioncanada/story.html?id=9148553e-2fc9-4bba-aa5c-0fb47f51d4d7|archivedate=September 27, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1991. From 1991 to 1994, he served as the Executive Director, and from 1994 to 1998, he served as the party's vice-president. A resident of [[Hope, British Columbia]], he ran in the Canadian federal elections of [[Canadian federal election, 1988|1988]], [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993]] and [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000]].

===Charles Cavilla (1991–1993)===

A difference of vision on leadership between Cavilla and the party board resulted in the transfer of leadership on an interim basis to [[Heather Stilwell]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Heather Stilwell (1993–1994) (interim)===
{{Main|Heather Stilwell}}

===Jean Blaquière (1994–1995)===
Blaquière, a [[Pentecostal]] pastor, was a candidate for the CHP in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|Canadian federal election of 1993]], and won the party leadership in March 1994 at a [[Vancouver]] convention, in a race with two other contenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/512732781.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+14%2C+1994&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Spectator&amp;desc=Heritage+party+elects+new+head&amp;pqatl=google|title=Heritage party elects new head|date=Mar 14, 1994|work=Hamilton Spectator|page=B6|accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blaquière stepped down at the next convention in November 1995 in [[London, Ontario]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==={{anchor|Ron Gray}} Ron Gray (1995–2008)===
Gray was the leader of the CHP from 1995 to 2008. Born and educated in [[British Columbia]], Gray has worked in journalism, public relations, and the federal public service. He began his career at ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'' newspaper, and has also worked at community newspapers in BC and in Suva, Fiji; and the ''[[BC Report]]'' magazine.  He was a public information officer for a major public utility in BC, and for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

He was a Trade and Commerce Officer attached to the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (Canada)|Canadian Consulate]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. He later managed store-front [[Canadian government|Federal government]] public information services in [[Winnipeg]] and [[Vancouver]]. He became Public Information Officer for one of BC's first community colleges, and later served 10 years in a similar capacity at [[Trinity Western University]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In the [[Canadian federal election, 1988|1988 federal election]], Gray ran in his first election under the Christian Heritage Party banner in the electoral district of [[Fraser Valley East]]. On election night, he placed fourth out of six candidates with over eight percent of the popular vote, finishing well behind [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] incumbent [[Ross Belsher]].&lt;ref name="defeat1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/HFER/hfer.asp?Language=E&amp;Search=Cresdetail&amp;Election=9379|title=Fraser Valley East 1988 Federal Election|publisher=Parliament of Canada|accessdate=October 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gray ran for the CHP in every general election until stepping down as leader in 2008, with the exception of 1993. He has also contested four byelections, including one in [[Calgary Southwest]] against [[Canadian Alliance]] leader [[Stephen Harper]]. In a 1999 byelection, he finished one vote ahead of the [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] candidate in the Quebec riding of [[Hull—Aylmer]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Gray became the party leader in 1995. His leadership was confirmed at three subsequent CHP conventions. He stepped down in November 2008. Near the end of 2006, a human rights complaint was filed against Ron Gray alleging communication via the Internet messages likely to expose homosexuals to hatred or contempt. By October 24, 2008, the complaint had been dropped and the file closed by the Canadian Human Rights Commission.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Hnatiuk was a candidate in the [[Canadian federal by-elections, 2009|November 9, 2009 by-election]] in the riding of [[Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley]], to replace [[Independent (politician)|independent]] [[Member of Parliament (Canada)|Member of Parliament]] [[Bill Casey]]. He came in fifth, losing to [[Scott Armstrong (politician)|Scott Armstrong]] of the [[Conservative Party of Canada]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Because of a difference in understanding on the leader's mandate to innovate in membership qualifications, and a motion by the national board to ask that the leader put promotion of his vision on hold until a full board meeting could discuss the vision, Hnatiuk submitted his resignation as leader effective February 1, 2014, though choosing to continue as a party member.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In his professional life, he operates the largest hunting, fishing and taxidermy business in Nova Scotia.&lt;ref name="press"/&gt;

He became active in his riding association and has served the party as candidate in each election since 1988. He served as candidate in the 2014 by-election in Macleod, Alberta.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Until early 2014, Reimer served as interim provincial president for Manitoba, and was appointed as interim national leader to succeed Hnatiuk until the fall 2014 national convention.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Rod Taylor (2014–present)===
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2016}}
Rod Taylor was born in 1951 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His family was involved in the US civil rights movement in the 1960s and various other social justice issues. He graduated from high school in California and moved with his parents and siblings to British Columbia (BC) in 1968.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;https://www.chp.ca/about/leader CHP Party Leader Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor has worked maintaining track and roadbed for the Canadian National Railway, on farms, in the oil and gas fields in Alberta, and in sawmills and forestry work in BC. From 1987 until 2009, Taylor was involved in lumber grading and lumber quality control in Smithers, BC. In 2000 Taylor won the BC Interior Lumber Grading Championship.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2001, Taylor ran as a provincial candidate for the [[British Columbia Unity Party]], and in 2004, 2006 and 2008 he represented the CHP in the federal riding of Skeena-Bulkley Valley.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Provincial branches==
The British Columbia Heritage Party voted to become the BC provincial wing of CHP in 2011, and was renamed as the [[Christian Heritage Party of British Columbia]] (CHP-BC) after signing a formal affiliation agreement in 2012. Members of the CHP in Manitoba began efforts around the same time to form a branch in their province, but as of 2015 little progress has been made.&lt;ref name="McKeen, 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKeen|first1=Leah A.

While the parties were not formally connected, the membership of the deregistered provincial [[New Reform Party of Ontario]] (formerly the Family Coalition Party of Ontario) overlapped significantly with CHP as the parties shared many socially conservative policies.&lt;ref name="McKeen, 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elect James Gault|url=http://www.electjamesgault.ca/|accessdate=31 January 2016|quote=James is the Leader of the New Reform Party that Elections Ontario deregistered  moments after he filed his candidacy for the Whitby-Oshawa by-election.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Civis Media Prize for Integration''' honors people for  [[Radio broadcasting|radio]] and [[television]] broadcasting projects that promote peaceful coexistence within the [[Immigration to Europe |European immigration]] community.

Promoting understanding between peoples of different [[culture]]s and [[religious beliefs]], revealing the complex causes of [[violence]] and demonstrating the successful mastering of conflict across national borders, can only succeed if the media report to the public about these complex topics realistically and informatively. Fighting [[racism]] and [[discrimination]] is not exclusively a national task.

The Civis media prize is awarded as a European television prize and as a German-language radio prize in EU and Switzerland. With the Young Civis media prize there is a sponsorship prize for young journalists as well as students and graduates of the film and media colleges, who are no older than 32 years of age. The CIVIS Online Media Prize will recognize journalistically-designed websites on the theme of integration and cultural diversity. The Civis prize is endowed with a total of 46,000 Euros. The entry is open to all programme contributions which satisfy the conditions of participation. It is presented on May every year and the prize-giving ceremony will be broadcast on radio and television.

== Organisation ==
The CIVIS Media Prize for integration and cultural diversity in Europe is organised annually in the [[European Union]] and [[Switzerland]], by the CIVIS Media Foundation on behalf of the [[ARD (broadcaster)|Association of Public Broadcasting Corporations in the Federal Republic of Germany (ARD)]], represented by [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]] (WDR), together with the [[Freudenberg Foundation]].

{{Chain of Command}}

A '''commander-in-chief''', also sometimes called supreme commander, or chief commander, is the person or body that exercises supreme operational [[command and control]] over a nation's [[military forces]].
As a technical term, it refers to military competencies that reside in a [[Nation state|nation-state's]] executive leadership—a [[head of state]] or a [[head of government]] .

Often, a given country's commander-in-chief (if held by an [[official]]) need not be or have been a commissioned officer or even a veteran. In these countries this follows the principle of [[civilian control of the military]].

==Definition==
The formal role and title of a ruler commanding the armed forces derives from ''[[Imperator]]'' of the [[Roman Kingdom]], [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire]], who possessed ''imperium'' (command and other regal) powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Auctor.html LacusCurtius • Roman Law — Auctor (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In English use, the term first applied to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England]] in 1639.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} It continued to be used during the [[English Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;For example: "Ordered, That this House joins and agrees with the House of Commons in this Vote; and that the Lord Admiral is hereby desired, from both Houses of Parliament, that the Commander in Chief of this Summer's Fleet under his Lordship, may be the Earl of Warwicke.", [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/lords-jrnl/vol4/pp645-646#h3-0007 House of Lords Journal 15 March 1642]&lt;/ref&gt; A nation's [[head of state]] (monarchical or republican) usually holds the nominal position of commander-in-chief, even if effective executive power is held by a separate [[head of government]]. In a [[parliamentary system]], the [[executive branch]] is ultimately dependent upon the will of the [[legislature]]; although the legislature does not issue orders directly to the armed forces and therefore does not control the military in any operational sense. [[Governor-general|Governors-general]] and colonial governors are also often appointed commander-in-chief of the military forces within their territory.

A commander-in-chief is sometimes referred to as ''supreme commander'', which is sometimes used as a specific term. The term is also used for military officers who hold such power and authority, not always through dictatorship, and as a subordinate (usually) to a head of state (see [[Generalissimo]]). The term is also used for officers who hold authority over an individual [[military branch]], [[special branch]] or within a [[theatre of operations]].&lt;ref&gt;Dupuy, Trevor N., Curt Johnson, and Grace P. Hayes. "Supreme Commander." Dictionary of Military Terms. New York: The H.W. Wilson Company, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heads of state as commanders-in-chief==
This includes heads of states who:
* Are chief executives with the political mandate to undertake discretionary decision-making, including command of the armed forces.
* Mostly ceremonial  heads of state (constitutional monarchs, viceroys and presidents in parliamentary republics) with residual substantive reserve powers over the armed forces, acting under normal circumstances on the constitutional advice of chief executives with the political mandate to undertake discretionary decision-making.

===Afghanistan===
According to the [[Constitution of Afghanistan]], The [[President of Afghanistan]] is the Commander-in-chief of [[Afghan Armed Forces]].

===Albania===
According to the [[Constitution of Albania]], The [[President of the Republic of Albania]] is the Commander-in-chief of [[Albanian Armed Forces]]. The incumbent Commander-in-chief is President [[Ilir Meta]].

===Argentina===
[[File:Presidente Macri en el Sillon de Rivadavia (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|[[President of Argentina|President]] [[Mauricio Macri]] of [[Argentina]], as the Commander-in-chief of the [[Argentine Armed Forces]] since December 10th 2015.]]
Under part II, chapter III, article 99, subsections 12, 13, 14 and 15, the [[Constitution of Argentina]] states that the [[President of the Argentine Nation]] is the "Commander-in-chief of [[Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic|all the armed forces of the Nation]]". It also states that the President is entitled to provide military posts in the granting of the jobs or grades of senior officers of the armed forces, and by itself on the battlefield; runs with its organization and distribution according to needs of the Nation and declares war and orders reprisals with the consent and approval of the [[Argentine National Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.senado.gov.ar/deInteresEnglish | title = CONSTITUTION OF THE ARGENTINE NATION | publisher = [[Argentine Senate]] | accessdate = 2014-01-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131022134856/http://www.senado.gov.ar/deInteresEnglish | archivedate = 22 October 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Defense (Argentina)|Ministry of Defense]] is the government department that assists and serves the President in the management of the armed forces ([[Argentine Army|Army]], [[Argentine Navy|Navy]] and [[Argentine Air Force|Air Force]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mindef.gov.ar/institucional/misiones-y-funciones/ministerio-de-defensa.html | title = Ministerio de Defensa | accessdate = 2014-01-21 | language = Spanish | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130918161625/http://www.mindef.gov.ar/institucional/misiones-y-funciones/ministerio-de-defensa.html | archivedate = 18 September 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:Aust-ww2-japan.jpg|right|thumb|[[Governor General of Australia|Governor General]] of Australia [[Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|The Lord Gowrie]] (right) signing the [[declaration of war]] against [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] with [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Curtin]] (left) looking on. (8 December 1941) ]]
Under chapter II of section 68 titled ''Command of the naval and military forces'', the [[Constitution of Australia]] states that: {{Quote|The command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the [[Governor General of Australia|Governor General]] as the [[Monarchy of Australia#Australian Defence Force|Queen's]] representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005Q00193/0332ed71-e2d9-4451-b6d1-33ec4b570e9f | title = The Constitution as in force on 1 June 2003 together with proclamation declaring the establishment of the Commonwealth, letters patent relating to the Office of Governor-General, Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942, Australia Act 1986. | publisher = [[ComLaw]] | accessdate = 2014-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In practice, however, the Governor-General does not play an active part in the [[Australian Defence Force]]'s command structure, and the [[Politics of Australia|democratically accountable]] [[Cabinet of Australia|Australian Cabinet]] (chaired by the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]) ''de facto'' controls the ADF. The [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]] and several subordinate ministers exercise this control through the [[Australian Defence Organisation]]. Section 8 of the Defence Act 1903 states:{{Quote|The [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister]] shall have the general control and administration of the Defence Force, and the powers vested in the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]], the [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of Navy]], the [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of Army]] and the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of Air Force]] by virtue of section 9, and the powers vested jointly in the [[Department of Defence (Australia)#Secretary, Department of Defence (SECDEF)|Secretary]] and the Chief of the Defence Force by virtue of section 9A, shall be exercised subject to and in accordance with any directions of the Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C1903A00020 | title = Defence Act 1903 | publisher = [[ComLaw]] | accessdate = 2014-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Austria===
The [[Constitution of Austria|Constitution]] ({{lang-de|Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz}}) states, in Article 80, that the [[President of Austria|Federal President]] is the ([[Figurehead|nominal]]) Commander-in-Chief of the [[Austrian Armed Forces]]. However, it further provides that the President may only have the Armed Forces at his disposal to the extent provided in the Defence Act ({{lang-de|Wehrgesetz}}); and that the supreme command over the Armed Forces is exercised by the [[List of Defense Ministers of Austria|minister of defence]] authorized to serve in this capacity by the [[Government of Austria|Federal Government]], i.e. the cabinet under the chairmanship of the [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]], as defined in Article 69.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1930_1/ERV_1930_1.pdf Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz (B-VG)].

===Bangladesh===
The commander-in-chief is the [[President of Bangladesh|president]], although executive power and responsibility for national defense resides with the [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|prime minister]]. The only exception was the first commander-in-chief, General [[M. A. G. Osmani]], during [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971, who was commander of all [[Bangladesh Forces]], reinstated to active duty by official BD government order, which after independence was gazetted in 1972. He retired on 7 April 1972 and relinquished all authority and duties to the President of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;Bangladesh : General M.A.G.

===Brunei===
The [[Sultan of Brunei]] is the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Royal Brunei Armed Forces]].

===Canada===
{{Further|Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Armed Forces}}
The powers of command-in-chief over the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] are vested in the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Constitution Act, 1867 |series=III.15 |publication-place=Westminster |publisher=Queen's Printer |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-1.html#h-3 |accessdate=2014-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528180209/http://www.laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-1.html |archivedate=28 May 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are delegated to the [[Governor General of Canada]], who also uses the title ''Commander-in-Chief''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title=Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor General of Canada| series=X.| publication-place=Ottawa| publication-date=1 October 1947| publisher=King's Printer for Canada| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/LettersPatent.html| accessdate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, the governor general is entitled to the uniform of a general/flag officer, with the crest of the office and special cuff braid serving as rank insignia.

By constitutional convention, the Crown's prerogative powers over the armed forces and constitutional powers as commander-in-chief are exercised on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]] and the rest of [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]], the governing ministry that commands the confidence of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. According to the [[National Defence Act]], the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]] is responsible and accountable to [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] for all matters related to national defence and the Canadian Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title=National Defence Act| url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-5/index.html | accessdate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, the governor general could also use his or her powers as commander-in-chief to stop any attempts to use the Canadian Forces unconstitutionally, though this has never occurred and would likely be highly controversial.

===People's Republic of China===
{{main|Supreme Military Command of the People's Republic of China}}
Article 93 of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] states the authority to direct the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China is vested with the [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|Central Military Commission]]; composed of a Chairman, and numerous Vice-Chairmen and members. The same article also states that the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] assumes overall responsibility for the work of the Central Military Commission, and that it is responsible to the [[National People's Congress]] and the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]].&lt;ref name="PRC Constitution"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://english.gov.cn/2005-08/05/content_20813.htm | title = Constitution | publisher = [[Government of the People's Republic of China]] | accessdate = 2014-01-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130726154413/http://english.gov.cn/2005-08/05/content_20813.htm | archivedate = 26 July 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Article 80 gives the [[President of the People's Republic of China]] (in addition to ceremonial [[head of state]] duties) the power to proclaim martial law, proclaim a state of war, and to issue mobilisation orders upon the decision of National People's Congress and its Standing Committee.&lt;ref name="PRC Constitution"/&gt;

The CMC Chairman and the President are distinctly separate state offices and they have not always been held by the same persons. However, beginning in 1993, during the tenure of [[Jiang Zemin]] as CMC Chairman and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], it has been standard practice to have the President, the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and the General Secretary of the Communist Party to be [[Paramount leader|normally held by the same person]]; although the slight differences in the start and end of terms for those respective offices means that there is some overlap between an occupant and his predecessor.

When [[Hong Kong]] was [[British Hong Kong|under British authority]], the [[Governor of Hong Kong|civilian Governor]] was ''ex officio'' Commander-in-Chief of the [[British Forces Overseas Hong Kong]]. After the territory's [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover]] to the People's Republic of China in 1997, the commanders of the [[PLA Hong Kong Garrison|People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison]] are PLA personnel from [[mainland China]].

===Croatia===
According to the [[Constitution of Croatia|Croatian constitution]], the [[President of Croatia]] is the Commander-in-Chief of [[Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia]]. In peace, the commander-in-chief exercises his command through the Minister of Defense. In war and in cases where the [[Ministry of Defense (Croatia)|Minister of Defense]] is not fulfilling orders, the commander-in-chief exercises his command directly through the chief of [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia|General Staff]].

===Czech Republic===
According to the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|1992 constitution]], the [[President of the Czech Republic]] is the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Military of the Czech Republic|Armed Forces]] according to Article 63(1)(c), and appoints and promotes generals under Article 63(1)(f). The President needs the [[countersignature]] of the [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] for decisions concerning the above-mentioned provisions as per Articles 63(3-4), or otherwise they are not valid. The Prime Minister may delegate to other ministers the right to countersign these decisions of the President. The political responsibility for the Armed Forces is borne by the [[Government of the Czech Republic|Government]], which in Article 67 is defined as the "supreme body of executive power". According to Articles 39 &amp; 43, the [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Parliament]] must give consent to the dispatch of Czech military forces outside the territory of the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hrad.cz/en/czech-republic/constitution-of-the-cr.shtml | title = Constitution of the CR of December 16, 1992. | publisher = [[President of the Czech Republic]] | accessdate = 2014-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Defence (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Defence]] is the central authority of the state administration for the control of the Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.army.cz/scripts/detail.php?id=5723 | title = Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic | publisher = [[Ministry of Defence (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Defence]] | accessdate = 2014-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual day-to-day management is vested in the Chief of the General Staff, the Czech [[chief of defence]] equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.army.cz/scripts/detail.php?id=5762 | title = Professional Army | publisher = [[Ministry of Defence (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Defence]] | accessdate = 2014-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
The position of the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Danish monarch]] as the head of the military is deeply rooted in tradition. While the [[Constitution of Denmark|1953 constitution]] does not explicitly designate the monarch as commander-in-chief; it is implicit, given the general provision in article 12 and the more specific wording of article 19 (2): "Except for purposes of defence against an armed attack upon the Realm or Danish forces, the King shall not use military force against any foreign state without the consent of the [[Folketing]]. Any measure which the King may take in pursuance of this provision shall forthwith be submitted to the Folketing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Publications/~/media/Pdf_materiale/Pdf_publikationer/English/The_constitutional_act_of_denmark_2013.pdf.ashx | title = Constitution Act | publisher = [[Folketing]] | accessdate = 2014-01-10 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20140703054726/http%3A//www.thedanishparliament.dk/Publications/%7E/media/Pdf_materiale/Pdf_publikationer/English/The_constitutional_act_of_denmark_2013.pdf.ashx | archivedate = 3 July 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when reading the Danish Constitution, it is important to bear in mind that the ''King'' in this context is understood by Danish jurists to be read as the ''[[Cabinet of Denmark|Government]]'' (consisting of the [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] and other ministers). This is a logical consequence of articles 12, 13 and 14, all of which in essence stipulates that the powers vested in the monarch can only be exercised through ministers, who are responsible for all acts. Thus, the Government, in effect, holds the supreme command authority implied in articles 12 and 19(2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Publications/~/media/Pdf_materiale/Pdf_publikationer/English/My_Constitutional_Act_v_11_2013.pdf.ashx |title=My Constitution Act with Explanations 2013 |publisher=[[Folketing]] |accessdate=2014-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103060508/http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Publications/~/media/Pdf_materiale/Pdf_publikationer/English/My_Constitutional_Act_v_11_2013.pdf.ashx |archivedate=3 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish Defence Law ({{lang-da|Forsvarsloven}}) designates in article 9 the [[Minister of Defence (Denmark)|Minister of Defence]] as the supreme authority in [[Danish Defence|Defence]] ({{lang-da|højeste ansvarlige myndighed for forsvaret}}). Under the Minister is the [[Chief of Defence (Denmark)|Chief of Defence]], the senior-ranking professional military officer heading the [[Defence Command (Denmark)|Defence Command]], who commands the [[Royal Danish Army|Army]], the [[Royal Danish Navy|Navy]], the [[Royal Danish Air Force|Air Force]] and other units not reporting directly to the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Ministry of Defence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=6294 | title = LOV nr 122 af 27/02/2001 om forsvarets formål, opgaver og organisation m.v. | accessdate = 2014-01-10 | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://forsvaret.dk/FKO/eng/Facts%20and%20Figures/Documents/Fakta%20om%20Forsvaret_UK.pdf | title = Facts and Figures | publisher = [[Danish Defence]] | accessdate = 2014-01-10 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131208034816/http://www.forsvaret.dk/FKO/eng/Facts%20and%20Figures/Documents/Fakta%20om%20Forsvaret_UK.pdf | archivedate = 8 December 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
In [[Egypt]], the [[President of Egypt|President of the Republic]] holds the ceremonial title of Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. A member of the government, usually defence minister, is commander-in-chief of the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]], the incumbent being [[Sedki Sobhi]]. The president still remains the only individual capable of declaring war. Until the election of [[Mohamed Morsi]] in June 2012, prior Egyptian presidents had all been former military officers, and during the [[Yom Kippur War]] the president played a major role at all levels of the planning of the war, and was in a literal sense Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces giving direct orders to the commanders from the headquarters during the war as [[field marshal]] of the [[Egyptian Army|army]], [[colonel general]] of the [[Egyptian Air Force|air force]] and air defence forces and admiral of the [[Egyptian Navy|navy]]. [[Anwar Sadat]] often wore his military uniform, while former president [[Hosni Mubarak]] had abandoned this tradition.

===Finland===
According to the [[Constitution of Finland|Finnish constitution]], the [[President of Finland]] is the commander-in-chief of all [[Military of Finland|Finnish military forces]]. In practice, the everyday command and control is in the hands of [[Chief of Defence (Finland)|Chief of Defence]] and the Commander of the [[Finnish Border Guard]].

{{main|Chief of the Armed Forces (France)}}
In [[France]], the [[President of the French Republic|President of the Republic]] is designated as "''Chef des Armées''" (literally "Chief of the Armies") under article 15 of the constitution, and is as such the supreme executive authority in military affairs.

====Pre-1958====
Since the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], France has been strongly centralized. After crushing local nobles engaged in warlord-ism, the Kings of France retained all authority with the help of able yet discreet Prime ministers ([[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]]).

The 1789 Revolution transferred the supreme authority to the King (in the context of the short-lived constitutional Monarchy), then to the multi-member ''[[Committee of Public Safety|Comité de Salut Public]]'' during the ''[[National Convention|Convention]]'', and later to the ''[[French Directory|Directoire]]'', before being regained in the hands of [[French Consulate|Consul]] [[Napoléon Bonaparte]], later [[First French Empire|Emperor Napoléon I]], alone.

The ''[[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Restoration]]'' restored the authority of the King, first in an absolute monarchy, then the  constitutional [[July Monarchy]] of [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]], before it was overthrown in turn by the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] and later the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] of [[Napoleon III]].

The following [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] was a parliamentary system, where the military authority was held by the [[Prime Minister of France|President of the Council of Ministers]]. During [[World War I]], the many visits to the trenches by the elderly statesman [[Georges Clemenceau]] impressed the soldiers and earned him the nickname ''Father of Victory'' ({{lang-fr|Le Père de la Victoire}}).

During [[World War II]], ''[[Marshal of France|Maréchal]]'' [[Philippe Pétain]] assumed power and held the supreme authority in [[Vichy France]], while Général [[Charles de Gaulle|Charles De Gaulle]], acting on behalf of the previous regime, founded the [[Free French Forces]], upon which he held supreme authority all through the war.

The following and short-lived [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] was a parliamentary system, which was replaced by the present [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]], a [[semi-presidential system]].

In the [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]], before the [[Constitution of Pakistan#The Constitution of 1973 -- the existing Constitution|1973 Constitution]], the head of the army, i.e., the Chief of the Army Staff, was referred as "Commander-in-Chief".{{rp|105}}&lt;ref name="Har-Anand Publications, Bajwa"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bajwa|first1=Kuldip Singh|title=Jammu and Kashmir war, 1947-1948 : political and military perspective|date=2003|publisher=Har-Anand Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788124109236|pages=350|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bREjE5yXNMC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=commander+in+chief+army++pakistan+1947&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwid092O8qDVAhUnhlQKHVKxC_AQuwUINjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=commander%20in%20chief%20army%20%20pakistan%201947&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 July 2017|language=en|format=google books|chapter=Kashmir Valley Saved}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was replaced by "Chief of Army Staff" on 20 March 1972{{rp|62}}&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, Singh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Ravi Shekhar Narain Singh|title=The Military Factor in Pakistan|date=2008|publisher=Lancer Publishers|location=London, UK|isbn=9780981537894|pages=550|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wCm2DFZblOYC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=Tikka+Khan+first+army+chief&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiphZzb8qDVAhUHwVQKHdCEDPY4ChC7BQhEMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=Tikka%20Khan%20first%20army%20chief&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 July 2017|language=en|format=googlebooks|chapter=Military and Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]] is a four-star general whose term is 3 years, but can be extended or renewed once. The Chief of Army Staff is chosen by the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]].

===Philippines===
The [[President of the Philippines|President]] of the [[Philippines]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and is mandated by Article VII, Section 18 of the [[1987 Constitution]] to be Commander-in-Chief of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gov.ph/the-philippine-constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-article-vii/ | title = THE 1987 CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES – ARTICLE VII | publisher = [[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]] | accessdate = 2014-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[History of the Philippines (1965-1986)|Fourth Republic]], the [[Sb. 1973|1973 Constitution]] introduced by [[Ferdinand Marcos]] created a [[parliamentary system]] that split the Executive into two, with the [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|prime minister]] retaining the office of commander-in-chief and the president reduced to a mere [[figurehead]]. The wording of Article VII, Section 9 in the [[SB. 1935|previous constitution]] enabled Marcos as commander-in-chief to [[Proclamation No. 1081|declare]] [[Martial Law in the Philippines|Martial Law]] and suspend the [[writ of habeas corpus]] on 21 September 1972. Marcos also issued an edict, conferring the rank of five-star general in the military to the President, as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. He consequently sat as both president and prime minister until 1981, when martial law was lifted and [[Cesar Virata]] succeeded him to the latter office and amendments were made to the 1973 Constitution to turn it into a strong president [[semi-presidential system]] in which the office of commander-in-chief was officially returned to the President. [[Salvador Laurel]] was the country's last prime minister when the office was abolished after the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]], and the position's powers were again merged with the Presidency.

The current Commander-in-Chief of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] is [[President]] [[Rodrigo Duterte]], serving as the supreme commander of all Filipino military units in the [[Philippines]].

===Poland===
In Poland, the [[President of Poland|President]] is Commander-in-Chief of the [[Polish Armed Forces]]. However, the art. 134 ust. 4 of the constitution states: {{Quote|The President of the Republic, for a period of war, shall appoint the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces on request of the Prime Minister. He may dismiss the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces in accordance with the same procedure. The authority of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, as well as the principle of his subordination to the constitutional organs of the Republic of Poland, shall be specified by statute.}}

During the [[Interbellum Poland|interbellum period]], the General Inspector of the Armed Forces was appointed the commander-in-chief for the time of war (Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces). However, after the war this function ceased to exist—thus it is likely that if Poland formally participates in a war, [[General Staff of the Polish Army|Chief of the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces]] will be appointed Supreme Commander.

===Portugal===
The [[President of the Portuguese Republic]] is the constitutional Supreme Commander of the [[Portuguese Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Comandante Supremo das Forças Armadas''). However, the operational command is delegated in the [[General Staff of the Armed Forces (Portugal)|Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces]].

In the Portuguese military parlance, the term "Commander-in-Chief" (in Portuguese: ''comandante-em-chefe'' or simply ''comandante-chefe'') refers to the unified military commander of all the land, naval and air forces in a theater of operations.

===Republic of China===
As stipulated in the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitution]] of the [[Republic of China]], the [[President of the Republic of China|President]] is also the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|ROC Armed Forces]] (including the [[Republic of China Military Police|Military Police]]), the [[Special Forces]], and the [[National Space Organization]].

The [[Russian Armed Forces]] is divided into three services: the [[Russian Ground Forces]], the [[Russian Navy]], and the [[Russian Air Force]]. In addition there are three independent ''arms of service'': [[RVSN|Strategic Missile Troops]], [[Russian Aerospace Defense Forces]], and the [[Russian Airborne Troops]]. The Air Defence Troops, the former [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]], have been subordinated into the Air Force since 1998.

===Saudi Arabia===
Article 60 of the [[Basic Law of Saudi Arabia]] states: "The King is the commander-in-chief of all the armed forces. He appoints officers and puts an end to their duties in accordance with the law."

Article 61 further states: "The King declares a state of emergency, general mobilization and war, and the law defines the rules for this."

Lastly, Article 62 states: "If there is a danger threatening the safety of the Kingdom or its territorial integrity, or the security of its people and its interests, or which impedes the functioning of the state institutions, the King may take urgent measures in order to deal with this danger And if the King considers that these measures should continue, he may then implement the necessary regulations to this end."

===Serbia===
In accordance with the law, the [[President of Serbia]] is Commander-in-chief of Armed Forces and in command of the military. He  appoints, promotes and recalls officers of the [[Military of Serbia|Army of Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.predsednik.rs/en/president | title = President of Serbia | publisher = Presidential Administration of Serbia| accessdate = 2016-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slovenia===
In Slovenia, the commander-in-chief is formally the [[President of Slovenia]], although he or she does not exercise this position in peacetime. Instead, this role is usually assumed by the Minister of Defence.

===South Korea===
In accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, the commander-in-chief is the [[President of South Korea]].

As with most remaining European monarchies, the position of the Spanish monarch as the nominal head of the armed forces is deeply rooted in traditions going centuries back.

The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] gives the [[Monarchy of Spain|King]] in article 62 (h): {{quote|supreme command of the [[Spanish Armed Forces|Armed Forces]]&lt;ref name="Spain" /&gt;}}

However, article 64 require that all official acts of the King must be [[countersignature|countersigned]], by the [[President of the Government (Spain)|President of the Government]] or other [[Ministry of Defence (Spain)|competent minister]], for them to become valid. Furthermore, article 97 stipulates that; {{Quote|The [[Cabinet of Spain|Government]] shall conduct domestic and foreign policy, civil and military administration and the defence of the State&lt;ref name="Spain" /&gt;}} And article 98 furthermore specifies the composition of the Government (which the King is not a member of). No provision in the constitution requires the King/Government to seek approval from the [[Cortes Generales]] before sending the armed forces abroad.&lt;ref name="Spain"&gt;[http://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/NR/rdonlyres/21C3D325-5C04-4B65-BE6C-A9A34F77FDC7/236841/Constitucion_Inglescorregido.pdf Constitution of Spain 1978], [[Government of Spain]]. Retrieved on 2014-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1984, the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Spain)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] is the professional head of the armed forces and, under the authority of the [[Minister of Defence (Spain)|Minister of Defence]], is responsible for military operations and military organisation.

===Sri Lanka===
As head of state, the [[President of Sri Lanka]], is nominally the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The [[National Security Council of Sri Lanka|National Security Council]], chaired by the president is the authority charged with formulating and executing defence policy for the nation. The highest level of military headquarters is the [[Ministry of Defence (Sri Lanka)|Ministry of Defence]], since 1978 except for a few rare occasions the president retained the portfolio defence, thus being the Minister of Defence. The ministry and the armed forces have been controlled by the during these periods by either a [[Minister of State]], [[Deputy Minister]] for defence, and of recently the [[Permanent Secretary]] to the Ministry of Defence. Prior to 1978 the [[Prime Minister of Sri Lanka|prime minister]] held the portfolio of Minister of Defence and External Affairs, and was supported by a [[Parliamentary Secretary]] for Defence and External Affairs.

Responsibility for the management of the forces is Ministry of Defence, while the planning and execution of [[combined operations]] is the responsibility of the Joint Operations Command (JOC). The JOC is headed by the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Sri Lanka)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] who is the most senior officer in the Armed Forces and is an appointment that can be held by an [[Air Chief Marshal]], [[Admiral]], or [[General]]. The three services have their own respective professional chiefs: the [[Commander of the Army (Sri Lanka)|Commander of the Army]], the [[Commander of the Navy (Sri Lanka)|Commander of the Navy]] and the [[Commander of the Air Force (Sri Lanka)|Commander of the Air Force]], who have much autonomy.

Dawson, ed. ''Commanders in Chief: Presidential Leadership in Modern Wars'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the National Security Act of 1947, this has been understood to mean all [[United States Armed Forces]].
U.S. ranks have their roots in British military traditions, with the President possessing ultimate authority, but no rank, maintaining a civilian status, other than the title of Commander in Chief.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Moten, ''Presidents and Their Generals: An American History of Command in War'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;
The exact degree of authority that the Constitution grants to the President as Commander in Chief has been the subject of much debate throughout history, with Congress at various times granting the President wide authority and at others attempting to restrict that authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/articles/article-ii/commander-in-chief-clause-ramsey-and-vladeck/clause/25|title="Common Interpretation: Commander in Chief Clause" |last=Ramsey|first=Michael|last2=Vladeck|first2=Stephen |website=National Constitution Center Educational Resources (some internal navigation required) |publisher=National Constitution Center |access-date=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1794, Washington used his constitutional powers to assemble 12,000 militia to quell the [[Whiskey Rebellion]]—a conflict in western Pennsylvania involving armed farmers and distillers who refused to pay excise tax on spirits. According to historian [[Joseph Ellis]], this was the "first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field", though [[James Madison]] briefly took control of artillery units in [[Burning of Washington|defense of Washington D.C.]] during the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Washington and the Evolution of the American Commander in Chief|publisher=The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation|url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/summer12/george.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abraham Lincoln]] was deeply involved in overall strategy and in day-to-day operations during the [[American Civil War]], 1861–1865; historians have given Lincoln high praise for his strategic sense and his ability to select and encourage commanders such as [[Ulysses S. Grant]].&lt;ref&gt;James M. McPherson, ''Tried by War: Abraham Lincoln As Commander in Chief'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; On the other extreme,  [[Woodrow Wilson]] paid very little attention to operational military details of [[World War I]] and had very little contact with the War Department or with General [[John J.

{{Cquote|''The Governor shall be commander in chief of the Kentucky active militia, and the adjutant general shall be the executive officer and shall be responsible to the Governor for the proper functioning of the Kentucky active militia, and he is hereby authorized and empowered to take necessary action to perfect and maintain an efficient organization for the purposes herein set out. He shall have charge of all matters of administration and organization, which shall be in all respects, insofar as necessary and applicable, the same as that of the National Guard.''}}

Similarly, Section 7 of Article 5&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_5 California Constitution - The Executive.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108203419/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_5 |date=8 January 2011 }}, Constitution of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Constitution of the [[State of California]] states:

{{Cquote|''The Governor is commander in chief of a militia that shall be provided by statute.  The Governor may call it forth to execute the law.''}}

===Venezuela===
According to the Venezuelan constitution, the President is Commander in chief of the Armed Forces. The office of the Venezuelan military supreme commander in chief has always been held by the President of Venezuela as per constitutional requirements. However, with a new law sanctioned in 2008, the "Comandante en Jefe" rank is not only a function attributed to the executive branch but a full military rank given to the president upon taking office. Upon assumption he receives a saber, epaulette, shoulder knot, shoulder board and sleeve insignia and full military uniform to be used in military events while performing the duties as president. The shoulder insignia mirrors Cuban practice but is derived from the German-styled officer rank insignia.

===Vietnam===
The commander-in-chief of the armed forces is the [[President of Vietnam]], through his post as Chairman of National Defense and Security Council. Though this position is nominal and real power is assumed by the [[Central Military Commission (Vietnam)|Central Military Commission]] of the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]]. The Secretary of Central Military Commission (usually the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam]]) is the de facto Commander.

The [[Ministry of Defence (Vietnam)|Minister of Defence]] oversees operations of the Ministry of Defence, and the [[Vietnam People's Army]]. He also oversees such agencies as the [[General Staff (Vietnam People's Army)|General Staff]] and the General Logistics Department. However, military policy is ultimately directed by the Central Military Commission of the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam.

==Other officeholders as commanders-in-chief or other situations==

===Ethiopia===
The [[1995 Constitution of Ethiopia|1995 Constitution]] designates the [[Prime Minister of Ethiopia]] as "Commander-in-Chief of the [[Ethiopian National Defense Force|national armed forces]]" in Article 74(1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hofethiopia.gov.et/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=13311&amp;folderId=94921&amp;name=DLFE-322.pdf | title = Constitution of Ethiopia | publisher = [[House of Federation]] | accessdate = 2014-01-21 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140202124130/http://www.hofethiopia.gov.et/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=13311&amp;folderId=94921&amp;name=DLFE-322.pdf | archive-date = 2 February 2014 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
====Present, Federal Republic (1956-)====
[[File:Bundeswehr_Reichstag_Dem_Deutschen_Volke.jpg|thumb|right|New recruits standing in front of the [[Reichstag building]], before taking the [[Ceremonial oath of the Bundeswehr|Bundeswehr oath]]. Due to its [[Nazi Germany|infamous history of the 20th century]], and before [[Prussian militarism]]; Germany of today puts a strong emphasis on having armed forces compatible with a [[parliamentary system]].]] 
Upon the re-militarization of [[West Germany]] in 1955, when it joined [[NATO]], the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] was amended in 1956 to include constitutional provisions for the command of the armed forces.
* In peacetime, under Article 65a, the [[Federal Minister of Defence (Germany)|Federal Minister of Defence]] ({{Lang-de|Bundesminister der Verteidigung}}) holds the supreme command authority ({{Lang-de|Inhaber der Befehls- und Kommandogewalt - IBuK}}) over the [[Bundeswehr]].&lt;ref name="germany"&gt;[https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany], [[Bundestag]] (Print version. As at: October 2010). Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If the [[Bundestag]] declares the [[State of Defence (Germany)|state of defence]] ({{Lang-de|Verteidigungsfall}}), the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Federal Chancellor]], under Article 115b, assumes the command authority over the armed forces.&lt;ref name="germany"/&gt; {{As of|2018}}, this has never happened.
* The [[President of Germany]] has thus no role in the command of the forces, although he continues to receive the ceremonial honors due to his position as a [[head of state]].

The rationale for placing the command authority over the armed forces directly with the responsible minister in charge of the military establishment, and thus breaking with the longstanding German constitutional tradition in both earlier monarchical and republican systems of placing it with the [[head of state]], was that in a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[parliamentary system]] the command authority should directly reside where it would be exercised and where it is subject to the parliamentary control of the [[Bundestag]] at all times. By assigning it directly to the responsible minister, instead of with the Federal Chancellor, this also meant that military affairs is but one of the many integrated responsibilities of the [[Cabinet of Germany|government]]; in stark contrast of earlier times when the separate division of the military establishment from the civil administration allowed the former to act as a [[state within a state]] (in contrast to the Federal Republic, the [[Weimar Republic]] began with the [[Ebert–Groener pact]], which kept the military establishment as an autonomous force outside the control of politics; the [[German presidential election, 1925|1925 election]] of [[Paul von Hindenburg]] as ''[[Reichpräsident]]'', surrounded by his [[camarilla]] and the machinations of [[Kurt von Schleicher]], did little to reverse the trend).&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.deutsches-wehrrecht.de/Aufsaetze/UBWV_2004_241.pdf Die Befehls- und Kommandogewalt des Art. 65a GG im Lichte ...] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213958/http://www.deutsches-wehrrecht.de/Aufsaetze/UBWV_2004_241.pdf |date=23 September 2015 }}, Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=7tRyJy-An1MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de Politik und Militär in Deutschland: die Bundespräsidenten und Bundeskanzler und ihre Beziehung zu Soldatentum und Bundeswehr], 2011.

====East Germany (1960-1990)====
The [[legislature]] of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), the ''[[Volkskammer]]'', enacted on 13 February 1960 the ''Law on the Formation of the National Defense Council of the GDR'', which established a council consisting of a chairman and at least 12 members.  This was later incorporated into the [[Constitution of the German Democratic Republic|GDR Constitution]] in April 1968.  The [[National Defense Council of the GDR|National Defense Council]] held the supreme command of the [[National People's Army]] (including the internal security forces), and the Council's chairman (usually the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany#General Secretaries of the Central Committee of the SED|General Secretary]] of the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]]) was considered the GDR's commander-in-chief.

The GDR joined with the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] on [[German Unity Day|3 October 1990]], upon which the GDR's constitution and armed forces were abolished.

====Before 1945====
During the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], [[German Empire]], [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]], whoever was the [[head of state]]—the [[King of Prussia]]/[[German Emperor]] (under the [[Constitution of Prussia (1850)|Constitution of the Kingdom of Prussia]]/[[Constitution of the German Empire]]) to 1918, the [[President of Germany (Weimar Republic)|Reichspräsident]] (under the [[Weimar Constitution]]) to 1934, and the [[Führer]] from 1934 to 1945—was the Head of the Armed Forces ({{lang-de|Oberbefehlshaber}}: literally "Supreme Commander").

Below the level of the Head of State, each [[military branch]] ({{lang-de|Teilstreitkraft}}) had its own head who reported directly to the Head of State and held the highest rank in his service; in the [[Reichsheer]] - [[Generalfeldmarschall]], and in the [[Reichsmarine]] - [[Großadmiral|Grossadmiral]].

After Chancellor [[Adolf Hitler]] assumed power as ''[[Führer]]''&lt;ref name="German 1934 law"&gt;[http://www.documentarchiv.de/ns/stobrhpt.html  Gesetz über das Staatsoberhaupt des Deutschen Reichs], 1 August 1934:&lt;br /&gt;"§ 1 The office of the Reichspräsident is merged with that of the Reichskanzler. Therefore, the previous rights of the Reichspräsident pass over to the Führer and Reichskanzler Adolf Hitler. He names his deputy."&lt;/ref&gt; (after the death of President [[Paul von Hindenburg]]), he would later grant his war minister, [[Generalfeldmarschall]] [[Werner von Blomberg]], the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces in 1935, when conscription was reintroduced. However, in 1938 due to the [[Blomberg–Fritsch Affair]], Hitler withdrew the Commander-in-Chief title, abolished the war ministerial post and assumed personal command of the Armed Forces. The war ministerial post was de facto overtaken by the ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'', which was headed by Generalfeldmarschall [[Wilhelm Keitel]] until the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German surrender]].

===Greece===
According to Article 45 of the [[Constitution of Greece|Greek Constitution]], the President is the Head of the [[Greek Armed Forces]], but their administration is exercised by the [[Government of Greece|Government]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.gr/?page_id=6105#45] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227235832/http://www.presidency.gr/?page_id=6105#45 |date=27 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]], the [[Minister for National Defence (Greece)|Minister for National Defence]] and the [[Hellenic National Defence General Staff|Chief of the General Staff]] are the ones who command the [[Greek Armed Forces|Armed Forces]].

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], the [[Basic Laws of Israel|applicable basic law]] states that the ultimate authority over the [[Israel Defense Forces]] rests with the [[Cabinet of Israel|Government of Israel]] (chaired by the [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]]) as a collective body. The authority of the Government is exercised by the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Minister of Defense]] on behalf of the Government. However, the Commander-in-Chief of the IDF is the [[Chief of General Staff (Israel)|Chief of General Staff]] who, despite being subordinate to the Minister of Defense, holds the highest level of command within the military.&lt;ref name="israel bl military"&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/basic11_eng.htm Basic Law of Israel: The Military], [[Knesset]].

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], prior to the [[Meiji Restoration]] the role of the commander-in-chief was vested in the ''[[shōgun]]'' (the most militarily powerful [[samurai]] ''[[daimyō]]''). After the dissolution of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] the role of the commander-in-chief, resided with the [[Emperor of Japan]]. The present-day [[Constitution of Japan|constitutional]] role of the Emperor is that of a ceremonial [[figurehead]] without any military role.

After Japan's move towards democracy, the position of Commander-in-Chief of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] is held by the [[Prime Minister of Japan]]. Military authority runs from the Prime Minister to the cabinet-level [[Minister of Defense (Japan)|Minister of Defense]] of the [[Ministry of Defense (Japan)|Japanese Ministry of Defense]].&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Japan |title=Self Defense Forces |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2012-07-15 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |oclc=56431036 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=25 August 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reorg"&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.mod.go.jp/e/about/organization/reorganized/p4-5.pdf | title = The Ministry of Defense Reorganized: For the Support of Peace and Security | year = 2007 | publisher = Japan Ministry of Defense | location = Tokyo | pages = 4–5| format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="職種　Branches of Service"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mod.go.jp/gsdf/about/branches/index.html | title = 職種　Branches of Service | year = 2012 | publisher = Japan Ground Self-Defense Force | location = Tokyo | language = Japanese | accessdate = 15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="n-soshiki"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Daihyakka Zensho (Nipponika) |script-title=ja:自衛隊: 組織 |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2012-07-15 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=Japanese |trans-title=JSDF: Organization |oclc=153301537 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=25 August 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta===

The Malta Armed Forces Act does not directly establish the [[President of Malta]] as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. However, Maltese law allows the President to raise by voluntary enlistment and maintain an armed force. Likewise, the law allows the President to issue orders in order to the administrate the armed forces.

It is important to note that the Armed Forces do not swear allegiance to the President of Malta but rather to the [[Malta|Republic of Malta]]. On this basis, there is no direct link between the head of state and the armed forces. For this reason, this link is mediated by the Minister responsible for defence.

Nonetheless, the Presidential Palaces are guarded by the Armed Forces as a symbolic gesture of social cohesion.

The [[Constitution of the Netherlands]] states, in article 97, that "''the Government shall have supreme authority over the [[Armed forces of the Netherlands|armed forces]]''". Article 42 defines the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|Government]] as the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Monarch]] and the ministers, and that only ministers are responsible for acts of government. Article 45 further defines the ministers as constituting the [[Council of Ministers of the Netherlands|Cabinet]], chaired by the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]], with "authority to decide upon overall government policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.government.nl/files/documents-and-publications/regulations/2012/10/18/the-constitution-of-the-kingdom-of-the-netherlands-2008/the-constitution-of-the-kingdom-of-the-netherlands-2008.pdf | title = The Constitution of the Kingdom of the Netherlands 2008 | publisher = [[Government of the Netherlands]] | accessdate = 2014-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Besselink"/&gt;

Before a constitution change took place in 1983, even though the equivalent section stated that: "''The King shall have supreme authority over the armed forces''"; that did not give the monarch any autonomous command authority.&lt;ref name="Besselink"&gt;{{cite techreport |first= Leonard F.M. |last= Besselink |title= The Legal And Constitutional Position of the Netherlands Armed Forces and International Military Cooperation |number= |institution= Universiteit Utrecht |url=http://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/214157/The%20Netherlands%20report%20%5bsecured%5d.pdf?sequence=1 |year= 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===
[[File:Standard of the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army.svg|thumb|Flag of the Supreme Commander]]
The [[Constitution of North Korea]] is ambiguous about which official really is the country's [[head of state]].
* Is it the [[Eternal President of the Republic]], the late [[Kim Il-sung]], designated as such in the [[preamble]];&lt;ref name="DPRK Eternal President"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/great/constitution.php?1 | title = DPRK Constitution (Preamble) | publisher = naenara.com.kp| accessdate = 2014-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* is it the [[President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly]], who under article 117 of the constitution directs the work of the Presidium, represents the State, and accredits North Korean diplomats and receives credentials from foreign diplomats;&lt;ref name="DPRK President of the Presidium"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/great/constitution.php?10 | title = DPRK Constitution (Chapter VI State Organs, Section 4.

* or is it the [[Chairman of the National Defence Commission]] who in article 100 is described as the "highest military leading organ of State power and an organ for general control over national defense of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea"?&lt;ref name="DPRK Chairman"/&gt;

In any case, the North Korean constitution, in article 102, is quite explicit regarding which official commands the armed forces:

{{Quote|The Chairman of the [[National Defence Commission]] of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the [[Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army|supreme commander of the whole armed forces]] of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and commands and directs all the [[military of North Korea|armed forces of the State]].&lt;ref name="DPRK Chairman"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/great/constitution.php?8 | title = DPRK Constitution (Chapter VI State Organs, Section 2.

The Chairman is formally elected by the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] (article 91:5&lt;ref name="DPRK Supreme Peolpe's Assembly"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/great/constitution.php?7 | title = DPRK Constitution (Chapter VI State Organs, Section 1.

===Sweden===
[[File:Swedishkingandprince.jpg|thumb|The Swedish Monarch ([[Carl XVI Gustaf|King Carl XVI Gustaf]]) is no longer the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]], although he continues to receive treatment befitting a [[head of state]].]]
In Sweden, with the [[Ordinance of Alsnö]] in 1280, [[Swedish nobility|nobles]] were exempted from land taxation if they provided cavalrymen to the King's service. Following the [[Swedish War of Liberation]] (1521–53) from the [[Kalmar Union]], a [[Svea Life Guards|Guards Regiment]] was formed under the King and from there the modern [[Swedish Army]] has its roots. During the age of the [[Swedish Empire]], several kings—[[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], [[Charles X of Sweden|Charles X]], [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] &amp; [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]]—personally led their forces into battle. Under the [[Instrument of Government (1809)|Instrument of Government of 1809]], which was in force until the current [[Constitution of Sweden|Instrument of Government of 1974]] went into force on 1 January 1975; the [[Monarch of Sweden|Monarch]] was in §§ 14-15 explicitly designated as the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] ({{lang-sv|Högste befälhavare}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sns.se/zino.aspx?articleID=839 |title=Regeringsformen 1809 med ändringar 1809-1974 |publisher=Studieförbundet Näringsliv och Samhälle |language=Swedish |accessdate=2014-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831012655/http://www.sns.se/zino.aspx?articleID=839 |archivedate=31 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, the [[Government of Sweden|Government]] ({{lang-sv|Regeringen}}) as a collective body, chaired and formed by the [[Prime Minister of Sweden]], holds the highest [[Executive (government)|Executive Authority]], subject to the will of the [[Riksdag of Sweden|Riksdag]]; and is thus the present day closest equivalent of a command-in-chief, although not explicitly designated as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.riksdagen.se/Global/dokument/dokument/laws/the-instrument-of-government-2012.pdf | title = The Instrument of Government | publisher = The [[Riksdag]] | accessdate = 2014-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this change was, apart from the fact that the King was since 1917 no longer expected to make political decisions without ministerial advice, that the new Instrument of Government was intended to be made as descriptive on the workings of the State as possible, and reflective on how decisions are actually made. [[Minister of Justice (Sweden)|Minister of Justice]] [[Lennart Geijer]] further remarked in the government bill that any continued pretensions of royal involvement in government decisions would be of a "fictitious nature" and "highly unsatisfactory".&lt;ref&gt;{{sv icon}} Prop. 1973:90.

Whilst the General acts as the highest military authority with a high degree of autonomy, he is still subordinate to the Federal Council (See Articles 58, 60, 174, 177, 180 &amp; 185).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/1/101.en.pdf Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation (English translation)] (as of March 2012), The Federal Authorities of the Swiss Confederation. Retrieved on 2013-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Assembly retains the sole power to dismiss the General, but the General remains subordinate to the Federal Council by the Council's ability to demobilise and hence making the position of General redundant.&lt;ref name="Swiss Security Sector" /&gt;

Four generals were appointed in Swiss history, General [[Henri Dufour]] during the [[Sonderbund|Swiss Civil War]], General [[Hans Herzog]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], General [[Ulrich Wille]] during the [[First World War]], and General [[Henri Guisan]] during the [[Second World War]] ("''la Mob''", "the [[Mobilisation]]"). Although Switzerland remained neutral during the latter three conflicts, the threat of having its territory used as a battlefield by the much bigger war parties of Germany and France required mobilization of the army.

A '''coronation crown''' is a [[crown (headgear)|crown]] used by a [[monarch]] when being [[coronation|crowned]]. In some monarchies, monarchs have or had a number of crowns for different occasions, such as a coronation crown for the moment of coronation and a ''state  crown'' for general usage in state ceremonial.

|-
| [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire]] || 960 - 1027 || [[File:Holy Roman Empire Crown (Imperial Treasury)2.jpg|125px]] || The coronation crown of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s. It was made in the late 10th or early 11th century. Unlike many other crowns, it has an octagonal rather than a circular shape, and is constructed from eight hinged plates.
|-
| [[St Edward's Crown]] || 1661 || [[File:St Edward's Crown.jpg|125px]] || The traditional [[England|English]] then [[United Kingdom|British]] coronation crown. It has been used a number of coronations since the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, but not, in fact the majority. The monarchs crowned with St. Edward's Crown were Charles II (1661), James II (1685), William III (1689), George V (1911), George VI (1937) and Elizabeth II (1953). [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] intended to be crowned with St. Edward's Crown but in the event used instead the lighter [[Imperial State Crown]] (St Edward's Crown being judged too heavy for the King to wear soon after his illness).
|-
| [[Crown of Charlemagne]] || 840 || [[File:French Coronation Crown of Charlemagne.png|125px]] || The coronation crown of [[King of France|Kings of France]] up to and including King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. It was destroyed during the [[French Revolution]].
|-
| [[Crown of St. Stephen]] || 1000 / 1100&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1300 || [[File:Hungarian Parliament 006 - Flickr - granada turnier.jpg|125px]] || No [[List of Hungarian rulers|Hungarian king]] was ever regarded as being truly legitimate without first being crowned with it. The original was a gift from [[Pope Sylvester II]] and was used to crown [[Stephen I of Hungary|St. Stephen I]], the first [[Christian]] king of [[Hungary]], in 1000 or 1001. It was later stolen and replaced with the current version, which is featured on [[Coat of arms of Hungary|Hungary's coat of arms]].
|-
| [[Crown of Saint Wenceslas]] || 1347 || [[File:CrownBohemia2.jpg|125px]] || The coronation crown of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] since 1347.
|-
| [[Crown of Bolesław I the Brave]] || 1000 / 1320 || [[File:Marcello Bacciarelli 001.jpg|125px]] || The traditional coronation crown of the [[Polish monarchs]]. According to legend [[Bolesław I the Brave]] received it from [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor]]. The original crown was lost in the course of history. It was only in 1320 that a new set of regalia was prepared for the coronation of King [[Władysław I the Elbow-high]] and survived as long as until the 18th century.
|-
| [[Imperial Crown of Russia]] || 1762 || [[File:Russian Crown Jewels 4.jpg|125px]] || The Imperial Crown of Russia, designed by [[Jérémie Pauzié]] in 1762 for the coronation of [[Catherine the Great]]. Inspired by the Byzantine Empire design, the crown was constructed of two gold and silver half spheres, representing the eastern and western Roman empires, divided by a foliate garland and fastened with a low hoop. The crown contains 75 pearls and 4,936 Indian diamonds forming laurel and oak leaves, the symbols of power and strength, and is surmounted by a 398.62 carat ruby spinel, that previously belonged to the [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]], and a diamond cross.  The crown was produced in a record two months and weighted only 2.3&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://famousdiamonds.tripod.com/russiancrownjewels.html |title=The Russian Crown Jewels |publisher=Famousdiamonds.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627113746/http://famousdiamonds.tripod.com/russiancrownjewels.html |archivedate=2014-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1762, the crown created by [[Jérémie Pauzié]] was the coronation crown of all Romanov emperors, till the monarchy’s abolition and the death of last Romanov, Nikolas II in 1918. It is considered to be one of the main treasures of the Romanov dynasty, and is now on display in the Moscow Kremlin Armoury Museum in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://almazi.net/index.php?page=index&amp;lang=eng |title=Diamond Fund Treasures |publisher=Almazi.net |date= |accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Great Crown of Victory]] || 1785 || [[File:King_Rama_IX_being_presented_with_regalia_at_coronation.jpg|125px]] || Created in 1782 for the second coronation of King [[Rama I]] of Siam. The crown is used during the ceremony of the [[coronation of the Thai monarch]] and not worn on any other occasion. During the coronation the king puts the crown unto his own head. The crown is made of gold and weighs over 16 lb (7.3&amp;nbsp;kg). On other state occasions the kings can wear the ''Kathina Crown'', which is a lighter alternative.

The '''Department of Agriculture and Food doesn't exist anymore as it was amalgamated with the department of fisheries, regional development and development commissions ''' ('''DAFWA''') is a [[Western Australia]]n government department responsible for regulating and advancing agricultural and food industries within the state. The [[Minister for Agriculture and Food (Western Australia)|Minister for Agriculture and Food]], currently [[Alannah MacTiernan]] of the [[Australian Labor Party (Western Australian Branch)|Labor Party]], is responsible for the department.

In 2004 the department had operating costs of $215,000,000 approx with $120,000,000 provided directly by the state government.  The balance was from federal government grants, public operating activities and user charges and fees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/content/_ABT/DEPT/ANNUALREPORT_0304.PDF Department of Agriculture Annual Report 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

This department is also responsible for [[quarantine]] control on all plants, soil and animal products brought into the state.  The Agricultural Protection Board [needs updating] is also part of this and responsible for the eradication of pests in Western Australia; including the rainbow lorikeet (''[[Trichoglossus moluccanus]]''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/content/pw/vp/bird/pn2006_rainbcontrol_mmassam.pdf Pestnote August 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411043216/http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/content/pw/vp/bird/pn2006_rainbcontrol_mmassam.pdf |date=11 April 2008 }} - Rainbow lorikeet management options&lt;/ref&gt; skeleton weed (''[[Chondrilla juncea]]''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/content/pw/weed/skeletonweed.htm Skeleton weed control in Western Australia] - accessed 23 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and Portuguese millipede (''[[Ommatoiulus moreletii]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/pls/portal30/docs/FOLDER/IKMP/PW/INS/GN2003_002.PDF Gardennote October 2006] - Portuguese millipedes&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1894, [[premier of Western Australia|Premier]] [[John Forrest]], established the Bureau of Agriculture under the chairmanship of [[Charles Harper (politician)|Charles Harper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Gabbedy, J.P.| year=1988| title = Group Settlement - Part 1, Its Origins (volume 1)| publisher = University of Western Australia Press| isbn = 0-85564-284-X |pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The members were A.R. Richardson, W. Paterson (the first manager of the [[Bank of Western Australia|Agricultural Bank]]), J.H.D. Amherst, [[Frederick Henry Piesse|F.H. Piesse]] and [[George Throssell|G.L. Throssell]].  Initially, the bureau was not placed under the supervision of a minister.  This changed in April 1898 when the bureau became the Agricultural Advisory Board and a new Department of Agriculture was gazetted under the control of Throssell as Commissioner for Crown Lands.

Professor William Lowrie was appointed director in 1908.  He resigned in 1911.  [[James Mitchell (Australian politician)|James Mitchell]] was at this time Minister for Agriculture and he expanded the senior position to three commissioners: George Lowe Sutton, as Commissioner for the Wheat Belt, James M.B. Connor as Commissioner for the South-West; and James P. Moody as Commissioner for the Fruit Industries.

==Research stations==
The department operates the following research stations throughout Western Australia:

Her [[Hindu]] father, Supriyo Chakravarty, is also a lawyer.&lt;ref name="issuu"&gt;{{cite news |last=Singh|first=Rani|url=http://issuu.com/abpl/docs/av_7thjune2014/9|title=Daughter of Famous Activists Leading a Life of Activism and Music|work= |issue=5|publisher=''Asian Voice''|date=7 June 2014|page=9|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents both decided to keep their respective religions after marriage.&lt;ref name="standpointmag"/&gt; She is her parents' only child.&lt;ref name="issuu"/&gt; Her maternal grandmother is poet [[Sufia Kamal]].&lt;ref name="thedailystar"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/cache/cached-news-details-191488.html|title=Tagore in Bollywood?|work= |publisher=''[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]''|date=26 June 2011|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doroteo Vasconcelos Vides y Ladrón de Guevara''' (1803&amp;ndash;1883) was [[President of El Salvador|President]] of [[El Salvador]] 7 February 1848 - 1 February 1850 and 4 February 1850 – 1 March 1851.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071006011951/http://www.casapres.gob.sv:80/presidentes/pres/dvasconcelos1850.htm Presidencia de El Salvador]&lt;/ref&gt; Vasconcelos was close friend of Honduran general [[Francisco Morazán]]. He tried to invade Guatemala and defeat general [[Rafael Carrera]] on 2 February 1851 but he was defeated.  After defeat, he retired from public life.

=== Helping Los Altos ===
{{Main|Los Altos, Central America}}
{{See also|Agustín Guzmán}}

In 1848, the liberals were able to force [[Rafael Carrera]] to leave office, after the country had been in turmoil for several months.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930|p=}}  Carrera resigned at his own free will and left for México.  The new liberal regime passed a law where they emphatically ordered to execute Carrera if he dared to return to Guatemalan soil.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930|p=}} On his absence, the liberal [[criollo people|crillos]] from [[Quetzaltenango]] -led by general [[Agustín Guzmán]] who occupied the city after Corregidor general [[Mariano Paredes (Guatemala)|Mariano Paredes]] was called to [[Guatemala City]] to take over the Presidential office{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=270}}- declared that [[Los Altos, Central America|Los Altos]] was an independent state once again on 26 August 1848; that had the support of Vasconcelos' regime in [[El Salvador]] and the rebel guerrilla army of Vicente and Serapio Cruz who were declared enemies of general Carrera.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=270-271}} The interim government was led by Guzmán himself and had Florencio Molina and priest Fernando Davila as his Cabinet members.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=271}} On 5 September 1848, the [[criollo people|criollos]] altenses chose a formal government led by Fernando Antonio Martínez.

In the meantime, Carrera decided to return to Guatemala and did so entering by [[Huehuetenango]], where he met with the native leaders and told them that they must unite to prevail; the leaders agreed and slowly the segretated native communities started developing a new Indian identity under Carrera's leadership.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}} In the meantime, on the oriental part of Guatemala, the Jalapa region became increasingly dangerous; former president [[Mariano Rivera Paz]] and rebel leader Vicente Cruz were both murdered there after trying to take over the Corregidor office in 1849.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}}

When Carrera arrived to [[Chiantla]] in [[Huehuetenango]], he received two altenses emissaries who told him that their soldiers were not going to fight his forces because that would lead to a native revolt, much like the one that happened in 1840; their only request from Carrera was to keep the natives under control.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}}  However, the altenses did not comply with their offer, and led by Guzmán and his forces, the started chasing Carrera; the caudillo's

On his absence, the liberal [[criollo people|crillos]] from [[Quetzaltenango]] -led by general [[Agustín Guzmán]] who occupied the city after Corregidor general [[Mariano Paredes (Guatemala)|Mariano Paredes]] was called to [[Guatemala City]] to take over the Presidential office{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=270}}- declared that [[Los Altos, Central America|Los Altos]] was an independent state once again on 26 August 1848; the new state had the support of Vasconcelos' regime in [[El Salvador]] and the rebel guerrilla army of Vicente and Serapio Cruz who were declared enemies of general Carrera.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=270-271}} The interim government was led by Guzmán himself and had Florencio Molina and priest Fernando Davila as his Cabinet members.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=271}} On 5 September 1848, the [[criollo people|criollos]] altenses chose a formal government led by Fernando Antonio Martínez. In the meantime, Carrera decided to return to Guatemala and did so entering by [[Huehuetenango]], where he met with the native leaders and told them that they had to remain united to prevail; the leaders agreed and slowly the segregated native communities started developing a new Indian identity under Carrera's leadership.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}} In the meantime, on the eastern part of Guatemala, the Jalapa region became increasingly dangerous; former president [[Mariano Rivera Paz]] and rebel leader Vicente Cruz were both murdered there after trying to take over the Corregidor office in 1849.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}}

Upon learning that officer [[José Víctor Zavala]] had been appointed as Corregidor in [[Suchitepéquez]], Carrera and his hundred jacalteco bodyguards crossed a dangerous jungle infested with jaguars to meet his former friend.  When they met, Zavala not only did not capture him, but agreed to serve under his orders, thus sending a strong message to both liberal and conservatives in Guatemala City, that realized that they were forced to negotiate with Carrera, otherwise they were going to have to battle on two fronts -Quetzaltenango and Jalapa.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=278}}  Carrera went back to the Quetzaltenango area, while Zavala remained in [[Suchitepéquez]] as a tactical maneuver.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=}} Carrera received a visit from a Cabinet member of Paredes and told him that he had control of the native population and that he assured Paredes that he will keep them appeased.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=278}} When the emissary returned to Guatemala City, he told the president everything Carrera said, and added that the native forces were formidable.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=279}}

[[Agustín Guzmán]] went to [[Antigua Guatemala]] to meet with another group of Paredes emissaries; they agreed that Los Altos would rejoin Guatemala, and that the latter would help Guzmán defeat his hated enemy and also build a port on the Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=279}} Guzmán was sure of victory this time, but his plan evaporated when, in his absence, Carrera and his native allies had occupied Quetzaltenango; Carrera appointed Ignacio Yrigoyen as Corregidor and convinced him that he should work with the k'iche', mam, q'anjobal and mam leaders to keep the region under control.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=280}}  On his way out, Yrigoyen murmured to a friend: Now he is the King of the Indians, indeed!{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=280}}

Guzmán then left for Jalapa, where he stroke a deal with the rebels, while [[Luis Batres Juarros]] convinced president Paredes to deal with Carrera; Guzmán could only get a temporary truce from the revolt leaders León Raymundo, Roberto Reyes and Agustín Pérez; however, the truce was short lived, as the rebels sacked Jalapa on June 3 and 4.  Guzmán then left for El Salvador, where after a while he issued a note to the rest of liberal leaders in Central America in which he attacked the immorality and viciousness of the savage Rafael Carrera, who -according to Guzmán- had not governed Guatemala properly in the last nine years.{{sfn|Woodward|1993|p=222}}  In his note, Guzmán told that he had gone to [[El Salvador]] to retire from public life, but that he could not remain impassible watching how Guatemala was returning to Carrera's rule and saying that with the help of [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]] and the reborn [[Los Altos, Central America|Los Altos]] he was going to confront Carrera and return to a Federal Government; he practically assured that he was Morazán's successor trying to get rid of Carrera, but his note did not gather any support and Carrera returned to power in Guatemala.{{sfn|Woodward|1993|p=223}}

=== Reelection ===

Vasconcelos finished his term in office and handed power to [[Ramón Rodríguez (Salvadoran politician)|Ramón Rodríguez]], who after only a few days give the power back to Vasconcelos for another 2-year term. During his time in office, he ordered the remains of Morazán to be returned to [[El Salvador]], where he buried his old leader with State honors. After the liberal defeat of [[Los Altos, Central America|Los Altos]] and the return of Carrera as Guatemala's strong man, Vasconcelos gave asylum to all the Guatemalan liberales that had been exiled from their country, which led to increased tension between [[El Salvador]] y [[Guatemala]].

=== Battle of La Arada ===
{{Main|Battle of La Arada}}
{{See also|Rafael Carrera|Vicente Cerna y Cerna|José Trinidad Cabañas}}

[[File:Carrerayturcios_2014-06-22_09-46.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Captain General [[Rafael Carrera]], defeated Vasconcelos in [[Battle of La Arada]].]]

After [[Rafael Carrera]] returned from exile in 1849, Vasconcelos granted asylum to the Guatemalan liberals, who harassed the Guatemalan government in several different forms: [[José Francisco Barrundia]] did it through a liberal newspaper that had been established with that specific goal; Vasconcelos gave support during a whole year to a rebel faction "La Montaña", in eastern Guatemala, providing and distributing money and weapons. By late 1850, Vasconcelos was getting impatient due to the slowness of the progress of the war with Guatemala and decided to plan an open attack. Under that circumstance, the Salvadorean head of state started a campaign against the conservative Guatemalan regime, inviting [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]] to participate in the alliance; only the [[Honduras|Honduran]] government led by [[Juan Lindo]] accepted.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930|p=}}

Meanwhile, in Guatemala, where the invasion plans were perfectly well-known, President [[Mariano Paredes (Guatemala)|Mariano Paredes]] started taking precautions to face the situation, while the Guatemalan Archbishop, [[Francisco de Paula García Peláez]], ordered peace prayers in the archdiocese.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;{{cite book|author=Woodward|year=1993|title=op.cit.|quote=In the Conservative regime of Guatemala, the Catholic Church was entangled with the Government and the leaders of both were relatives, mostly of the Aycinena family.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 January 1851, Vasconcelos and Lindo met in [[Ocotepeque]], Honduras, where they signed an alliance against Guatemala. The Salvadorean army had 4,000 men, properly trained and armed and supported by artillery; the Honduran army numbered 2,000 men. The coalition army was stationed in [[Metapán]], El Salvador, due to its proximity with both the Guatemalan and Honduran borders.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930|p=}}{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=316-317}}

On 28 January 1851, Vasconcelos sent a letter to the Guatemalan Ministry of Foreign Relations, in which he demanded that the Guatemalan president relinquish power, so that the alliance could designate a new head of state loyal to the liberals and that Rafael Carrera be exiled, escorted to any of the Guatemalan southern ports by a Salvadorean regiment.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=315}} The Guatemalan government did not accept the terms and the Allied army entered Guatemalan territory at three different places. On 29 January, a 500-man contingent entered through Piñuelas, [[Agua Blanca, Jutiapa|Agua Blanca]] and [[Jutiapa]], led by General Vicente Baquero, but the majority of the invading force marched from Metapán. The Allied army was composed of 4,500 men led by Vasconcelos, as Commander in Chief. Other commanders were general [[José Santos Guardiola]], general [[Ramón Belloso]], general [[José Trinidad Cabañas]], and general [[Gerardo Barrios]]. Guatemala was able to recruit 2,000 men, led by Lieutenant General [[Rafael Carrera]] as Commander in Chief and several colonels.

Carrera's strategy was to feign a retreat, forcing the enemy forces to follow the "retreating" troops to a place he had previously chosen; on February 1, 1851, both armies were facing each other with only the San José river between them. Carrera had fortified the foothills of La Arada, its summit about {{Convert|50|m|ft}} above the level of the river. A meadow {{Convert|300|m|ft}} deep lay between the hill and the river, and boarding the meadow was a sugar cane plantation. Carrera divided his army in three sections: the left wing was led by Cerna and Solares; the right wing led by Bolaños. He personally led the central battalion, where he placed his artillery. Five hundred men stayed in [[Chiquimula]] to defend the city and to aid in a possible retreat, leaving only 1,500 Guatemalans against an enemy of 4,500.

The battle began at 8:30&amp;nbsp;AM, when Allied troops initiated an attack at three different points, with an intense fire opened by both armies. The first Allied attack was repelled by the defenders of the foothill; during the second attack, the Allied troops were able to take the first line of trenches. They were subsequently expelled. During the third attack, the Allied force advanced to a point where it was impossible to distinguish between Guatemalan and Allied troops. Then, the fight became a melee, while the Guatemalan artillery severely punished the invaders. At the height of the battle when the Guatemalans faced an uncertain fate, Carrera ordered that sugar cane plantation around the meadow to be set on fire. The invading army was now surrounded: to the front, they faced the furious Guatemalan fire, to the flanks, a huge fire and to the rear, the river, all of which made retreat very difficult. The central division of the Allied force panicked and started a disorderly retreat. Soon, all of the Allied troops started retreating.

The 500 men of the rearguard pursued what was left of the Allied army, which desperately fled for the borders of their respective countries. The final count of the Allied losses were 528 dead, 200 prisoners, 1,000 rifles, 13,000 rounds of ammunition, many pack animals and baggage, 11 drums and seven artillery pieces. Vasconcelos sought refuge in [[El Salvador]], while two Generals mounted on the same horse were seen crossing the Honduran border. Carrera regrouped his army and crossed the Salvadorean border, occupying [[Santa Ana, El Salvador|Santa Ana]], before he received orders from the Guatemalan President, Mariano Paredes, to return to Guatemala, since the Allies were requesting a cease-fire and a peace treaty.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=311-328}}

After this terrible defeat, Vasconcelos retired from both the presidency and public life.

The film stars [[Michael Caine]], [[Julie Walters]], and [[Maureen Lipman]]. It won multiple major awards for best actor and best actress and was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]].

Caine and Walters both won [[BAFTA Awards|BAFTA]] and [[Golden Globe]] awards for best actor and actress. The [[British Film Institute]] ranked ''Educating Rita'' the [[BFI Top 100 British films|84th greatest British film of the 20th century]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinemarealm.com/best-of-cinema/top-100-british-films/ ''British Film Institute - Top 100 British Films''] (1999). Retrieved 27 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
===Summary===
A [[Liverpudlian]] [[working-class]] young woman&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; hairdresser&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Rita ([[Julie Walters]]) wants to better herself by studying literature. Her assigned [[Open University]] professor, Frank Bryant ([[Michael Caine]]), however, has long ago openly taken to the bottle, and soon develops misgivings about Rita's ability to adapt to student culture. Bryant is a jaded university lecturer, who describes his occupational ability as "appalling but good enough for his appalling students". His passion for literature is reignited by Rita, whose technical ability for the subject is limited by her lack of education but whose enthusiasm Frank finds refreshing.

===Professor's mistake===
To illustrate the rhyming principle of [[assonance]], the repetition of vowel sounds, Dr. Bryant gives as an example the words 'swans' and 'stones' from [[W B Yeats]]'s ''[[The Wild Swans at Coole]]''. This is instead an example of [[literary consonance|consonance]], the repetition of consonant sounds. However, in a scene just before Rita meets Dr. Bryant, some students mockingly observe, "He doesn't even know what assonance means!", confirming that it is Dr. Bryant's mistake, not the film's. In an ensuing discussion between Dr. Bryant and Rita, he asks her whether she understands assonance.  Rita replies, "Yeah, it means you've got the rhyme wrong."

==Theme==
The film focuses on Rita's unhappiness with her life in her [[blue-collar]], working-class environment, including her husband who wants Rita to cease her educational pursuits and instead to have children.  Rita struggles to fit into a new educated middle-class existence in academia, while seeking a "better song to sing".  Rita's original preconceptions that the educated classes have better lives and are happier people are brought into question throughout the film through Frank's failing social life and alcoholism and her flatmate Trish's attempted suicide. Rita, her search, and her search's meaning for her, all evolve as she adapts to academia and grows as a person.

==Production==
Lewis Gilbert says it was difficult to raise finance for the film. "Columbia wanted me to cast [[Dolly Parton]] as Rita".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/10/culture.features2|title=Of human Bondage|date=9 March 2000|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julie Walters, in her feature film debut, reprised her role from the stage production.

The film was shot in [[Dublin]]. [[Trinity College, Dublin]], is used as the setting for the university, and [[University College Dublin]], in Belfield, [[Dublin]], is used for Rita's summer school. The rooms used by Bryant as his office and tutorial room were those of the [[College Historical Society]] and the [[University Philosophical Society]], respectively; and while the building was considerably refurnished, the production chose to leave portraits of [[Douglas Hyde]] and [[Isaac Butt]] and committee photographs in the former, and a bust of [[John Pentland Mahaffy]] in the latter. No. 8 Hogan Avenue in Dublin 2 near [[Grand Canal Dock]] was used for Rita's house in the film, and one in Burlington Road, [[Ballsbridge]] for Bryant's. The scene where Rita runs into her ex Denny and his new wife was filmed in the [[South Lotts]] area of [[Ringsend]]. The scene in France was filmed in [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth|Maynooth]], [[County Kildare]], and [[Pearse Station]] and [[Dublin Airport]] were also used. The scene in the pub was shot in The Stag's Head pub on Dame Court in Dublin. However, the pub which Rita enters is the Dame Tavern which is opposite The Stag's Head. Filming also took place in Stonybatter with Aughrim St Church being used for the wedding scene. Stanhope St school was used as a production base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Educating Rita film locations|url=http://www.reelstreets.com/index.php/component/films/?task=view&amp;id=1716&amp;film_ref=educating_rita&amp;limitstart=0|publisher=Reelstreets.com|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critics===
The American ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine in December 1982 lauded Walters' interpretation of Rita as "[w]itty, down-to-earth, kind and loaded with common sense."  "Rita," the review continues, "is the antithesis of the humorless, stuffy and stagnated academic world she so longs to infiltrate. Julie Walters injects her with just the right mix of comedy and pathos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790649/ | title= Educating Rita (UK)| work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=31 December 1982|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Nathan reviewing the film for Britain's ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' film magazine calls the film a "gem," and gives it four out of five stars. He describes Walters's "splendidly rich interpretation" of Rita and characterises her "reactions to the traditions of English lit[erature] [as] carry[ing] the caustic brilliance of true intelligence, a shattering of blithe pretension".  Of Walters and Caine, Nathan opines, "they make a beautifully odd couple, in a love story at one remove". This reviewer depicts the director's effort as "effective, and finally optimistic," and observes about the film that the playwright's "angry message that people are trapped by their environment not their abilities, is salved by the sweetness of [Frank's and Rita's] final parting."  Nathan's "verdict" of the film is one of "[c]harming, glittering characterisations that, though they don't run deep, nevertheless refresh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nathan|first=Ian| url= http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=14854 | title= Educating Rita|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|date=14 October 2015|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American critic [[Janet Maslin]] called the film "an awkward blend of intellectual pretension and cute obvious humour" and "the perfect play about literature for anyone who wouldn't dream of actually reading books"; she wrote that "the essentially two-character play has been opened up to the point that it includes a variety of settings and subordinate figures, but it never approaches anything lifelike".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|authorlink=Janet Maslin|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F00E3D71138F932A1575AC0A965948260 | title= Educating Rita (1983)|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= 21 September 1983|accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two stars out of four, calling the film a "forced march through a [[Formula fiction|formula]] relationship"; he said Russell's [[Film adaptation|screen adaptation]] "added mistresses, colleagues, husbands, in-laws, students and a faculty committee, [that were] all unnecessary" and said the playwright/screenwriter "start[ed] with an idealistic, challenging idea, and then cynically tr[ied] to broaden its appeal".&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19831028/REVIEWS/310280301/1023 | title= Educating Rita| date= 28 October 1983 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]| accessdate= 21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project, however, never got off the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/nov/15/news | title= In brief: Black cast for ''Educating Rita'' remake | date= 15 November 2002 | publisher= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15047">{{About|Export Control Act of 1940|the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 |Arms Export Control Act}}

{{POV|date=June 2014}}

The '''Export Control Act''' of 1940 was one in a series of legislative efforts by the [[United States]] government and initially the administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to accomplish two tasks: to avoid scarcity of critical commodities in a likely pre-war environment,&lt;ref name=usinfo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/ites/0997/ijee/ejcontrl.htm |title=Overview of U.S. Export Control Laws |accessdate=2008-10-27 |work=America.gov.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to limit the exportation of [[materiel]]&lt;!--this is correct term for war supplies &amp; "war" is not needed as redundant--&gt; to pre-[[World War II]] [[Empire of Japan#Pacific War|Imperial Japan]]. The act originated as a presidential proclamation by Roosevelt forbidding the exporting of aircraft parts, chemicals, and minerals without a license, and was intended to induce Japan to curtail its [[Second Sino-Japanese War|occupation]] of the [[Indochina|Indo-Chinese]] coast.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/united-states-passes-export-control-act |title=July 5, 1940: United States passes Export Control Act |accessdate=2012-09-04 |work=History.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of the Act stated that whenever the President deemed it "necessary in the interest of national defense," he could prohibit or curtail the exportation of military equipment, munitions, tools and materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/chr/chr40-07.html |title=World War II Resources |accessdate=2008-10-27 |work=iBiblio.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navsource.org/Naval/1940.htm |title=U.S. Naval Chronology Of W.W.II, 1940 |accessdate=2008-10-27 |work=Navsource. Org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although controls were first authorized in 1940 in regard to munitions and similar materials essential to the defense effort, its coverage was extended in 1942 to all commodities, and broader geographic coverage, following America's entry into [[World War II]].  The law was extended, with modifications through 1948, and it was envisioned that remaining controls would soon disappear at the time of re-enactment in 1949.  The scarcity of certain goods in the world markets however, made continuance of controls necessary in order to prevent a drain on such goods from plentiful American supplies with its consequential inflationary effects.  National security and foreign policy concerns, especially following the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], were new and compelling reasons for passing the [[Export Control Act of 1949]],  and in extending it until (at least) 1958.  The law included both domestic policies aimed primarily at conditions within the United States, as well as controls directed at conditions outside the country, as an instrument of American foreign policy. This is exemplified by the restrictions on export of certain strategic or military items to the Soviet bloc or to other countries which it felt, if permitted, would be detrimental to the foreign policy program of the United States during the [[Cold War]].  The foreign policy motive became so strong that it brought legislation directing the President to enlist the cooperation of other nations in enacting controls on trade with the Soviet block to parallel those of the United States. The benefits of the various economic and military aid programs were to be withheld from non-cooperating nations, as in the [[Mutual Defense Assistance Act|Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951]].

==Background==

==="Moral embargo"===
The Act was seen as a codified "moral embargo", in that it was an expression of moral outrage,&lt;ref name=HolyokeUniversity&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/WorldWar2/japan.htm |title=Relations with Japan: 1938-1940 |accessdate=2008-10-27 |work=Mt. Holyoke University}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this instance, stemming from the Japanese bombing of civilians in mainland China in the late 1930s. In June 1938, the [[U.S. Secretary of State]], [[Cordell Hull]] on June, 1938 condemned the slaughter and its "material encouragement". A month later, the Department of State notified aircraft manufacturers and exporters that the United States Government was "strongly opposed"&lt;ref name=HolyokeUniversity/&gt; to the sale of airplanes and related materiel to those nations using airplanes to attack civilian populations.

In 1939, the non-binding embargo was extended to materials essential to airplane manufacture and to plans, plants, and technical information for the production of high-quality aviation gasoline. These measures resulted in the suspension of the export to Japan of aircraft, aeronautical equipment, and other materials within the scope of the moral embargoes. As Japanese purchases of items other than aircraft and aeronautical equipment were minuscule, the moral embargo ultimately stopped the exportation of arms to Japan.

===End of commercial treaties===
Following the failure of diplomatic efforts to protect endangered American lives, rights and economic interests in China, America considered commercial retaliation against Japan. by Japanese authorities or Japanese-sponsored agents in China. The American government felt that its [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|1911 commercial treaty]] with Japan was not affording an appropriate level of protection to U.S. commerce in areas within or occupied by Japan. Simultaneously, Japan's position under the treaty as a [[most favoured nation]] legally prevented the adoption of retaliatory measures against Japanese commerce. When the United States gave six-month notice of its withdrawal from the treaty in July, 1939, it removed the primary legal obstacle for embargo.&lt;ref name=HolyokeUniversity/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1983 |title=Peace and War: United States Foreign Policy, 1931-1941 |journal=U.S. Department of State Publication |volume= |issue=1983 |pages=87–97 |id= |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/paw/|accessdate= |quote=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
The embargo, which halted the shipment of material such as airplanes, parts, machine tools, and aviation gasoline, was designed to be an unfriendly act, but expanding it to include oil was specifically avoided. Japan was dependent on U.S. oil, and it was thought at the time that such would be a provocative step.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Toland | first=John | author-link= John Toland (author)| title=''[[The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936–1945]]''| edition= | place= | publication-place=New York | publisher=Random House | volume= | pages= | id= | doi= | isbn=978-0-8129-6858-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controls were first authorized in 1940 in regard to munitions and similar materials essential to the defense effort, and extended in 1942 to all commodities.&lt;ref&gt;Act of July 2, 1940, ch. 508, § 6, 54 Stat. 714; Act of June 30, 1942, ch. 461, 56 Stat. 463.

==Retaliation==
The United States was not alone in its concern. Great Britain, which maintained colonies in the Far East also feared an aggressive Japan. Immediately following the enactment of the Act, the British ambassador would be asked by Japan to close the [[Burma Road]], a key supply route of arms for China. Britain initially refused the request, but for a short period of time closed the road.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The British and the Dutch followed suit in embargoing trade to Japan from their colonies in southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=RobertHiggs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=1930 |title=How U.S. Economic Warfare Provoked Japan's Attack on Pearl Harbor |accessdate=2008-10-28 |last=Higgs |first=Robert |coauthors= |date=1 May 2006 |work=Commentary |publisher=The Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ending of the commercial trade treaties further eroded the possibilities for dialogue between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=William Henry |last1=Chamberlin |first2=Percy L. |last2=Greaves Jr. |first3=George A. |last3=Lundberg |first4=George |last4=Morgenstern |first5=William L. |last5=Neumann |first6=Frederic R. |last6=Sanborn |first7=Charles Callan |last7=Tansill|author1-link=William Henry Chamberlin|author2-link=Percy L.

[[Robert Stinnett]] notes in his book, ''[[Day of Deceit|Day Of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor]]'', that America had broken the Japanese diplomatic code and knew that due to the pressure exerted by the Export Control Act, war was quickly becoming an inevitable outcome. He points to a deciphered communiqué between Foreign Minister [[Teijiro Toyoda]] and Ambassador [[Kichisaburō Nomura]] on July 31: "Commercial and economic relations between Japan and third countries, led by England and the United States, are gradually becoming so horribly strained that we cannot endure it much longer. Consequently, our Empire, to save its very life, must take measures to secure the raw materials of the South Seas."&lt;ref name=RobertHiggs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Day Of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor]] |last=Stinnett |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Stinnett |coauthors= |date=8 May 2000 |publisher=Free Press, Touchstone ed |location=New York |isbn= 0-7432-0129-9 |pages=416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post World War II use==
After World War II, the Export Control Act was expanded to prevent the diversion of advanced technology to the Soviet bloc and China and, in later years, to alter the behavior of foreign countries.&lt;ref name=usinfo/&gt; Scarcity of certain goods in the world markets made continuance of controls necessary in order to prevent a drain on such goods from plentiful American supplies, with its consequential inflationary influence. It was envisioned that remaining controls would soon disappear at the time of re-enactment in 1949,&lt;ref&gt;S.Rep. Bo. 31, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 2-3 (1949). Cited in, Paul H Silverstone, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3310274 The Export Control Act of 1949: Extraterritorial Enforcement], [[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]], Vol. 107, No. 3, Jan., 1959, p.331-32 and ff&lt;/ref&gt; but national security and foreign policy, especially following the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], were new and compelling reasons for extending the [[Export Control Act of 1949]]&lt;ref&gt;63 Stat.7, 50 U.S.C. App. §§2021-32 (1952). Cited in Silverstone&lt;/ref&gt; in 1951, 1953, 1956 and again in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Act of May 16, 1951, ch. 83, 65 Stat. 43; Act of June 16, 1953, ch.116, 67 Stat. 62; Act of June 29, 1956, ch.473, § 1, 70 Stat.407; Pib. L. No.466, 72 Stat.220 (U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. (July 20, 1958)). See H.R. Rep. No.318, 82nd Cong., 1st Sess. (1951). Cited in Silverstone&lt;/ref&gt;

The Export Control Act of 1949 is an example of the type of legislation that it renders, subject to the regulations promulgated under it, all persons wherever situated. Under its provisions exports of scarce materials are controlled both from an economic standpoint—short supply and consequent inflationary effect on foreign demand; and the security standpoint—[[Autarchism|autarchy]] and self-sufficiency in strategic resources not available in sufficiently large quantities. These are both domestic policies aimed primarily at conditions within the United States, but controls are also directed at conditions outside the country as an instrument of [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]]. This is exemplified by the restrictions on export of certain strategic or military items to the Soviet bloc or to other countries which it felt, if permitted, would be detrimental to the foreign policy program of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Sect 2, 63 Stat.7 (1949), 50 USC App. § 2022 (1952). Cited in Silverstone&lt;/ref&gt; This latter motive became so strong that it brought legislation directing the President to enlist the cooperation of other nations in enacting controls on trade with the Soviet block to parallel those of the United States. The benefits of the various economic and military aid programs were to be withheld from non-cooperating nations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mutual Defense Assistance Act|Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951 (Battle Act)]] (ch 575, 65 Stat. 644, 22 USC § 1611-13c (1952). Cited in Silverstone)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Francophone Association of Municipalities of Ontario''' (or '''AFMO''', from its French name, '''''Association française des municipalités d'Ontario''''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] political organization of municipalities in the province of [[Ontario]] which have significant [[Franco-Ontarian]] communities. The organization oversees the maintenance and development of municipal government services in [[French language|French]], and works with other levels of government, as well as organizations in other Canadian provinces, on issues unique to francophone and bilingual communities.

In addition to the organization's 40 member municipalities, a number of other non-municipal organizations and individuals have associate member status, including one municipal government in [[Quebec]].

'''High policing''' is a form of [[intelligence-led policing]] that serves to protect the national [[government]] or a conglomerate of national governments from internal threats; that is, any [[police|policing]] operations integrated into domestic intelligence gathering, [[national security]], or [[international security]] operations for the purpose of protecting government.

== Etymology ==
The term "high policing" was introduced into English language police studies by Canadian criminologist [[Jean-Paul Brodeur]] in a 1983 article entitled "High Policing and Low Policing: Remarks about the Policing of Political Activities" and derives from the [[French language|French]] ''haute police'', the political police force established in [[France]] under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jean-Paul |last=Brodeur |title=High Policing and Low Policing: Remarks about the Policing of Political Activities  |journal=Social Problems |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=507–520 |date=June 1983 |jstor=800268 |doi=10.2307/800268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims ==

The term "high policing" refers to the fact that such policing benefits the "higher" interests of the government rather than individual citizens or the mass population. It also refers to the fact that high-policing organizations are endowed with authority and legal powers superior to that of other types of police organizations.

There is no conventional designation for this category of policing in [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], however, and it should not be conflated with [[secret police]], although secret police organizations do use high policing methods. Calling it "secret" or "political" policing is too vague since all police work is somewhat both secret (police generally do not reveal their methods until a case is completed) and political (police enforce laws determined by the political system in power).

The primary tool of high policing is [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]], which is derived from both human ("[[Humint]]") and technological sources. The former includes the use of secret informants to gather information on the activities of citizens, while the latter includes [[electronic surveillance]] and [[eavesdropping]], such as [[closed-circuit television|closed-circuit]] camera monitoring, [[telephone tapping]], and [[computer and network surveillance|Internet tapping]].

== Agencies ==

High policing in western [[democracy|democratic]] countries is performed by both national police forces and specialized [[intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]], such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] in the [[United States]], [[MI5]] in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Special Detective Unit]] and [[Directorate of Intelligence (Ireland)|Directorate of Intelligence]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]], the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]], and the [[New Zealand Security Intelligence Service]].

These organizations usually confront domestic or internal threats to national security, whereas the [[military]] or [[military intelligence]] agencies generally handle foreign or external threats. However, this distinction can become blurred, especially in cases involving [[terrorism]].

== Human rights concerns ==

High policing has an extremely high potential for abuse. There is a tendency, even in democratic countries, for high policing organizations to abuse their powers or even to operate outside the law because many organizations involved in high policing are granted extensive legal powers, including [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]] from [[prosecution]] for acts that are criminal under normal circumstances. In some countries, for example, high-policing organizations regularly engage in actions of dubious legality, such as [[arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrarily arresting and detaining]] people without charge, without [[right to counsel|legal representation]], and [[Wiktionary:incommunicado|without means of communication]]; some high-policing forces also engage in [[torture]]. In the worst cases, high policing becomes a substitute for the whole [[criminal justice system]]: [[suspect]]s are [[arrest]]ed, [[trial|tried]], [[conviction|convicted]], and [[sentence (law)|sentenced]] entirely by a national security agency, usually very expeditiously and in complete [[secrecy]], as is the case in [[police state]]s.

The Inner Mongolian People's Party was established on March 23, 1997 in Princeton, New Jersey with the goal of creating an independent state of Inner Mongolia.&lt;ref name="impp_eng"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.innermongolia.org/english/index.html |title=Inner Mongolian People's Party (English) |accessdate=2010-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211061430/http://www.innermongolia.org/english/index.html |archivedate=2011-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the creation of the IMPP is that some of the Inner Mongolian people still have many unaddressed grievances dating back to the atrocities committed during Cultural Revolution. They believe that the Chinese government has not been held accountable or acknowledged their wrongdoings.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Brown | first=Kerry | title=The Cultural Revolution in Inner Mongolia 1967–1969: The Purge of the “Heirs of Genghis Khan” | journal=Asian Affairs | volume=38 | number=2 | date=July 2007 | doi=10.1080/03068370701349128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The re-unification of Inner Mongolia and Mongolia is not currently within the “scope” of the IMPP as their current primary focus is on attaining independence for Inner Mongolia.&lt;ref name="impp_eng"/&gt;

==Organization==
The IMPP has a Chairman and Vice Chairman who are directly elected. The Secretary General is proposed by the Chairman and approved by the Standing Committee, who is elected by Congress Representatives. The Chairman, Vice Chairman and Secretary General all are automatically Committee members. The IMPP has branches in a few countries that are set up by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. Additionally, there is an advisory board that is made up of non-IMPP members.

In March 1997, more than fifty IMPP members from Mongolia, Germany, Japan, Canada and the United States attended the first Congress of the Inner Mongolian People’s Party, which meets every four years, and acts as a decision making body. Xi Haiming was elected as Chairman, Bache was elected Vice Chairman, and Oyunbilig was elected as General Secretary.&lt;ref name="smhric-39"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smhric.org/news_39.htm | title=Overview of Inner Mongolian Separatist Organizations Abroad | website=Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center | access-date=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, at the Congressional meeting the Constitution was passed, membership criteria agreed upon, flag design finalized and, an “Open Letter to the People of Inner Mongolia” was issued and distributed.&lt;ref name="smhric-39"/&gt;
The party’s headquarters are in the United States due to the contentious relationship with the People’s Republic of China. Due to sensitivity issues and to protect IMPP members, there is limited information available to the public concerning party membership and the identities of their members.

==Key members==

===Xi Haiming, Chairman===
[[Xi Haiming]], (Mongolian: Temtsiltu Shobtsood) was born in 1957 in Inner Mongolia. In the mid 1970s, he was actively involved in Inner Mongolian efforts to hold the Chinese government accountable to punish the people involved in the “cleansing campaign” during the Cultural Revolution. In 1981, the Chinese government implemented a policy to resettle millions of Chinese people in Inner Mongolia. Xi, as a student at the University of Inner Mongolia, became an influential student leader fighting to have the Chinese government reverse the policy and founded the Inner Mongolian League for the Defense of Human Rights.&lt;ref name="impp_eng"/&gt; Due to his activities, the Chinese authorities put him under surveillance. In 1991, many of his friends were arrested causing him to flee to Mongolia. In 1993, he was granted political [[asylum in Germany]] and currently lives there with his wife and daughter.&lt;ref name="impp_eng"/&gt;

===Bache, Vice Chairman===
[[Bache (activist)|Bache]], born in 1955 in Xinjiang, used to be a member of the Communist Party of China. In 1990, he went abroad on official duty and did not return. Presently, he is a visiting scholar with the East Asian Institute at Columbia University.&lt;ref name="smhric-39"/&gt;
To read his publication regarding the “cleansing of Inner Mongolians during the Cultural Revolution,” see: [http://www.innermongolia.org/english/50%20years%20of%20turmoil.htm].

===Oyunbilig, General Secretary===
[[Oyunbilig]], born in 1968 in Inner Mongolia, graduated from Beijing University in 1990 and worked for the Chinese Aerospace Department and as a business representative to Mongolia. He was actively involved in the 1989 Tiananmen Square Student Movement in Beijing. In 1995, he was granted political asylum in the U.S. and is currently living in Maryland.&lt;ref name="impp_eng"/&gt;

==Membership==
The only criterion for membership is that the individual accept the Constitution and is willing to actively participate in all events. According to the Constitution, members are free to withdraw their membership should they wish to do so.&lt;ref name="const"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.innermongolia.org/english/cst.htm |title=Constitution of the Inner Mongolian People's Party |website=Inner Mongolian People's Party |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927155219/http://www.innermongolia.org/english/cst.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitution==
The Constitution, passed at the first Congress, states the party’s main goals as “to uphold the principles of democracy and peace in fighting to end the Chinese Communist Party's colonial rule in Inner Mongolia” and the “ultimate goal is to achieve the independence of Inner Mongolia.” &lt;ref name="const"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smhric-39"/&gt;

==Flag Symbolism==
The IMPP flag, as stipulated by their Constitution, has a blue background with images of a red fire (top), a golden sun (middle), and a white moon (bottom).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://fotw.info/flags/cn-impp.html#impp | title=Inner Mongolian Political Parties: Inner Mongolian People's Party | website=Flags of the World | access-date=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blue background signifies the "Eternal Blue Heaven” (Mongolian: Monkh Khokh Tengger). The Mongols believe the spirit of the “Eternal Blue Heaven” is in all objects in the universe, especially in fire, sun and moon, which is why these three elements are represented on the flag. These same images can be found on the national flag of Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://fotw.info/flags/mn.html | title=Mongolia | website=Flags of the World | access-date=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of China-Inner Mongolia relations==
Inner Mongolia is located between the Republic of [[Mongolia]] and the People's Republic of China. China was under Mongol rule when Genghis Khan toppled the Song Dynasty (960-1279) and Kublai Khanm proclaimed the Mongolian Yuan State (1271–1368). After the fall of the Yuan Dynasty, China was returned to Han Chinese control and stayed that way through the Ming (1368–1644) Dynasty until the Qing (1644–1911) Dynasty when China was invaded and ruled by the Manchu people.

During the Qing Dynasty and the Republican period (1911–1949), Inner Mongolia was heavily populated with Han settlers. The Nationalists, who ruled during the Republican period, banned the use of the Mongolian language and were said to be more ruthless than the Japanese who later occupied Inner Mongolia. In the 1920-1940’s there were many political movements to reunite Inner Mongolia with the Mongolian People’s Republic (MPR) (that was established due to Soviet sponsorship).

During WWII, the Soviet-Mongolian joint army entered Inner Mongolia to fight the Japanese. The Inner Mongolians gave allegiance to the Communists to fight the Japanese in hopes of attaining their independence after the war.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;&lt;!--dead reference: http://ehis.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=daeab1d6-741c-495f-b861-c234517a7b39%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=115 --&gt; However, this was not the case. On May 1, 1947 the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region (IMAR) (Mongolian: Öbür mongγol-un öbertegen zasaqu orun, Chinese: 内蒙古自治区， pinyin: Nèi Měnggǔ Zìzhìqū) was established. IMAR also had close ties with the USSR through the Mongolian People’s Republic. The Inner Mongolians hoped that Communist Rule would be better than the previous Nationalist rulers.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;

Ulanfu was appointed by the Communist Party to rule Inner Mongolia. As Ulanfu was of Mongolian ethnicity, it was an improvement for the Inner Mongolia’s as even though they did not have independence, they were at least being ruled by an ethnic Mongolian. 
Ulanfu was an early Communist activist, studied in the [[USSR]] and joined the Red Army in [[Yenan]]. Mao Zedong, at first, trusted and supported him.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;

For the next two decades, Ulanfu worked to balance the needs of the Inner Mongolian people and the demands of the Communist Party. In the 1950s, Ulanfu’s balancing act became more difficult with the Communist Party’s land, social and political reforms aimed to tie Inner Mongolia closer to China. Ulanfu struggled to preserve Inner Mongolian interests as well as the Central Government’s as tensions increased.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt; His efforts to adapt the reforms to the needs of the local population lead to his downfall and made him the target of Maoists.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;

In the 1960s, as the Cultural Revolution was coming into fruition, China and the USSR cut ties. Anyone with connections to the USSR was seen as a potential political enemy. In 1966, Ulanfu due to his previous close connection to the USSR, was to become one of the most senior victims of the Cultural Revolution when he was denounced and dismissed for alleged anti-party activities. He disappeared until after Mao’s death when he was appointed Vice Premier in a wave of rehabilitations of party officials&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt; who fell victim to the witch hunts during the Cultural Revolution.

==Cultural Revolution: Purge of the IMPP==
During the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese Cultural Revolution]] (CR) (1966–1976), Chairman Mao Zedong in his quest to reassert his own power, Socialism, and rid Chinese society of traditional, capitalist and cultural elements, went after every person that he deemed a capitalist or disloyal to the Communist Party. Many minority groups including the Inner Mongolians, Tibetans and Uyghurs (people from Xinjiang) were targeted. 
Inner Mongolia, although far from Beijing was not unaffected by the CR. The treatment of the Inner Mongolians from 1967-1969 was especially brutal resulting in 22,000 known deaths and 300,000 known injuries.

After Ulanfu was ousted, chaos ensued with multiple clashes between students and the army. Zhou Enlai attempted to deal with what was being called the “IMAR problem” and chaired meetings between the local groups and central leaders trying to ease the situation. The result was that a senior Han Chinese General, Teng Haiqing, was put in place in April 1967.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;

Under General Teng’s leadership, the already tense situation erupted. The Mongolian language was banned from publications and an office, run by a Mongolian, Ulanbaagen, was set up to, “root out the IMPP.” Ulanbaagen had to produce a list of people under suspicion.
In 1969, Beijing acknowledged that the situation in Inner Mongolia needed to be controlled. General Teng was reprimanded and forced to apologize as to not let the government lose face.

After the Cultural Revolution came to an end, the episode in Inner Mongolia was blamed on the Gang of Four&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt; and the Lin Biao Clique. 
The Cultural Revolution affected almost every person of Mongolian descent{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} and set the stage for the future creation of the IMPP.

[[File:Janet Anne Galloway.jpg|alt=Janet Anne Galloway|thumb|379x379px|Janet Anne Galloway]]
'''Janet Anne Galloway''' (1841–1909) was an advocate for higher education for women in Scotland, supporter of the [[Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women]] and secretary of [[Queen Margaret College (Glasgow)|Queen Margaret College]].

==Early life==
Janet Anne Galloway was born in [[Birdston]], Stirlingshire, Scotland on 10 October 1841, the only surviving daughter in four children born to Alexander Galloway (1802–1883) a land surveyor and estate factor and his wife, Anne Bald.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/47536|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Richmond|first=Lesley|publisher=University of Oxford|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/47536|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Janet moved with her family to Glasgow in 1844, where her father worked as a land agent, valuer, and accountant.

==Education==
Janet was initially educated in Britain, before being sent to schools in France, Germany, and Netherlands where she learnt to speak French and German fluently. She also developed an interest in history and archaeology&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women|last2=Innes|first2=Sue|last3=Reynolds|first3=Sian|last4=Pipes|first4=Rose|date=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=0748626603|page=131|last1=Ewan|first1=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was taught bookkeeping and business methods by her father.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Janet was known to be an accomplished pianist with an enduring love for music.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women==
As a result of the limited educational opportunities open to women, Janet became an active supporter of the movement for higher education provision for women.  In 1877 Janet was appointed as the honorary secretary of the new [[Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women]], founded by [[Jessie Campbell]] and financed by [[Isabella Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldchanging.gla.ac.uk/notable-people/?id=33|title=Janet Anne Galloway|last=|first=|date=|website=Notable People|publisher=University of Glasgow|access-date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Caird (theologian)|John Caird]], principal of Glasgow University at the time, was the first Chairman of its General Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://glasgowuniversity.wordpress.com/tag/glasgow-association-for-the-higher-education-of-women/|title=Q is for....Queen Margaret College|last=Helle|first=Jani|date=|website=Photos from Glasgow University|publisher=University of Glasgow|access-date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janet was responsible for recruiting teachers lecturers and examiners, and helped to develop and plan teaching methods and standards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Queen Margaret College==
[[File:Queen Margaret College, North Park House, Glasgow, Scotland.jpg|alt=Queen Margaret College, North Park House|thumb|Queen Margaret College, North Park House]]
The [[Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women]] was incorporated into [[Queen Margaret College (Glasgow)|Queen Margaret College]] in 1833. The college opened in 1884 in North Park House, Glasgow, a merchants' mansion acquired by Isabella Elder and gifted to the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/building/?id=29|title=The University of Glasgow Story: Queen Margaret College|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Glasgow|publisher=University of Glasgow|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Janet became the first secretary of the college, though she refused to accept any remuneration for her duties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Following her father's death in 1833, Janet moved into the college premises at North Park House.

==University of Glasgow==
Queen Margaret College became part of the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1892, following the Scottish Universities Commissioners ordinance to empower Scottish Universities to provide instruction for women and enable them to graduate. At this point Janet became an officer of the university, though she continued to decline payment for her services.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH1111&amp;type=P|title=The University of Glasgow Story: Janet Anne Galloway|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Glasgow|publisher=University of Glasgow|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janet took a keen interest in the pastoral life of the university's female students; she organised social events and gatherings, encouraged the formation of societies and unions, and followed their careers after they graduated.  In 1885 Janet was one of the founders of the Queen Margaret Guild an organisation that arranged talks for the university extension movement, and in 1894 she helped to found the student residence Queen Margaret Hall.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  She also helped to establish a women graduates association&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and was an active member of the executive committee of the [[Queen Margaret Settlement Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mackintosh-architecture.gla.ac.uk/catalogue/name/?nid=QMCSA|title=Mackintosh Architecture: Queen Margaret College Settlement Association|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Glasgow|publisher=|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was part of the social reform [[settlement movement]] established in the 1880s.  In 1893 Janet was personally invited to the Chicago Great Exhibition as a representative of Queen Margaret College.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women|last2=Innes|first2=Sue|last3=Reynolds|first3=Sian|last4=Pipes|first4=Rose|date=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=0748626603|page=131|last1=Ewan|first1=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Janet was awarded an Honorary [[LL.D|LLD]] by the University of Glasgow in 1907 in recognition of her lifelong dedication to the higher education of women&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Politics and Religion==
Janet was a political Conservative who opposed both [[women's suffrage]] and the employment of female lecturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chemistry Was Their Life: Pioneering British Women Chemists, 1880-1949|last=Rayner-Canham|first=Marelene F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2008|isbn=1860949878|location=|pages=291|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; She initially believed that Queen Margaret College should educate women in their traditional roles, rather than equip them to enter men's professions.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Although she was an advocate of single sex education she also campaigned throughout her life to open universities to women.

Janet was baptized within the [[Church of Scotland]] but was a dedicated member of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] in Glasgow.

==Death and Memorial==
[[File:Janet Galloway Memorial Window, Bute Hall, University of Glasgow.jpg|alt=Janet Galloway Memorial Window, Bute Hall, University of Glasgow|thumb|Janet Galloway Memorial Window, Bute Hall, University of Glasgow]]
Janet, who remained unmarried throughout her life, continued working right up to her death on 23 January 1909. She died at her home on Queen Margaret Drive, Glasgow and is buried in Lennoxtown cemetery, Campsie.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Following her death, a fund was raised for a memorial window in Bute Hall at the University of Glasgow. The Janet Galloway Memorial Window, titled ''The Pursuit of Ideal Education'', pictures Janet alongside Isabella Elder and Jessie Campbell.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A former student remembered Janet as being:&lt;blockquote&gt;"never too busy to see a student, advised as to courses and future careers, encouraged the ambitious, scolded the frivolous, found friends for the solitary, secured posts for those who were ready for them, and smoothed untrodden paths for many a diffident beginner".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldchanging.gla.ac.uk/article/?id=27|title=University of Glasgow: World Changing: Pioneering the University Education of Women in Scotland|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Glasgow|publisher=University of Glasgow|access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1946">The '''League for Small and Subject Nationalities''' was a self-determinist organisation formed during [[World War I]] in [[New York City]], with the following aims:

:''...to establish a permanent congress of the small, subject and oppressed nationalities of the world; to assert the right of each nationality to direct representation at the peace conference following this war, as well as at every international conference held thereafter for the discussion of questions affecting its interests; to present the case of these nationalities to the world; to emphasize the importance of restoring to these nationalities the right of self-government as an indispensable condition for world peace..."&lt;ref&gt;Charity Organization Society of the City of New York ''The Survey: social, charitable, civic : a journal of constructive philanthropy, Volume 38''. The Charity Organization Society of the City of New York, 1917

The League's President was [[Frederic C. Howe]], who was also [[United States]] Commissioner of Immigration.
At a controversial meeting held in October 1917, the League was accused of pro-German bias when the issue of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] was due to be discussed. The Irish delegation was represented by [[Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington]] of [[Sinn Féin]], who was also accused of sympathies for [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CE3DD113AE433A2575AC2A9669D946696D6CF|title=QUIT CONVENTION FOR SMALL NATIONS|date=October 29, 1917|publisher=The New York Times|pages=9|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5529">This is a list of the governments of [[Ghana]]. Prior to independence, Ghana was under colonial rule in various forms including direct or indirect British rule. On February 12, 1951, the first Ghanaian government or cabinet, dominated by native Ghanaians was formed in the run up to independence on March 6, 1957. since then, Ghana has had a mix of democratically elected governments as well as military ones. It has had a one party state status between 1964 and 1966 while some of the military governments have had extensive civilian involvement such as the [[Provisional National Defence Council]] governments.

{{Politics of Zimbabwe}}
The following is a list of '''parliamentary [[Electoral district|constituencies]] in [[Zimbabwe]]''', as broken down by [[Provinces of Zimbabwe|province]]. The list covers both the [[House of Assembly of Zimbabwe|House of Assembly]] and [[Senate of Zimbabwe|Senate]], and is current as of the [[Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 2008|2008 parliamentary elections]]. The Senate seats are [[Nesting (voting districts)|nested]], meaning that each Senate constituency is made up of multiple House constituencies. For each Senate constituency, the House constituencies it contains are listed in parenthesis.

The House of Assembly consists of 270 members. Of these, 210 are elected in [[Single-member district|single-member constituencies]] of roughly equal size, with provinces having a varying number of constituencies depending on population. (The remaining 60 seats are elected at the province level, and are [[Reserved political positions|reserved for women]]). In the Senate, each of the 10 provinces elect 6 members to the Senate, and an extra 20 members elected in other ways, for a total of 80 members of the Senate.

The '''National Merit Scholarship Program''' is a [[United States]] academic [[scholarship]] competition for recognition and university scholarships administered by the National Merit Scholarship Corporation (NMSC), a privately funded, [[not-for-profit]] organization based in [[Evanston, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalmerit.org/corporate_sponsor.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119140436/http://nationalmerit.org/corporate_sponsor.pdf | dead-url=yes | archive-date=November 19, 2008 | title=NMSC Corporate Brochure | format=PDF | accessdate=October 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program began in 1955.

NMSC conducts an annual competition for recognition and scholarships: the National Merit Scholarship Program, which is open to all students who meet entry requirements, and until 2015,&lt;ref name="uncf"&gt;[http://www.nationalmerit.org/hc/vitalfacts.php NMSC Vital Facts – United Negro College Fund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208074549/http://www.nationalmerit.org/hc/vitalfacts.php |date=2015-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it also ran the National Achievement Scholarship Program (est. 1964), which was reserved for African-American students. The highest-achieving students in the National Merit Scholarship Program are designated as National Merit Scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Merit Scholarship – Winner Selection|url=http://www.nationalmerit.org/nmsp.php|publisher=National Merit Scholarship Corporation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002110233/http://www.nationalmerit.org/nmsp.php|archivedate=2006-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Nmsc.gif|frame|Logo of the National Merit Scholarship Corporation]] --&gt; Finalists and Semifinalists are also given recognition for their academic and extracurricular achievements. Commended Students are named on the basis of a nationally applied Selection Index score, which may vary from year to year and is typically below the level required for participants to be named Semifinalists in their respective states. Each year's [[PSAT/NMSQT|Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test]] (PSAT/NMSQT) is the qualifying test for a student's entry to a particular year's competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Merit Scholarship Program – Student Entry Requirements|url=http://www.nationalmerit.org/entering.php#scores|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002110126/http://www.nationalmerit.org/entering.php#scores|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-10-02|publisher=National Merit Scholarship Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1.6 million students in some 22,000 high schools enter the National Merit Scholarship competition annually when they take the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalmerit.org/s/1758/interior.aspx?sid=1758&amp;gid=2&amp;pgid=424|title=National Merit Scholarship Competition|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This serves to screen program entrants, measuring [[critical reading]] ability, [[mathematics]] problem-solving ability, and [[writing]] ability, rather than existing knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=College Board – PSAT/NMSQT – A Vital Step on the Path to College Success|url=https://www.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt|publisher=College Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semifinalists are designated on a state representational basis, contingent on the total number of entrants and in proportion to each state’s percentage of the nation’s high school graduating seniors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourfinancialaidoffice.com/national-merit-scholarship-corporation/|title=National Merit Scholarship Corporation|publisher=Your Financial Aid Office|accessdate=24 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506232207/http://www.yourfinancialaidoffice.com/national-merit-scholarship-corporation/|archivedate=6 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semifinalists are the highest-scoring program entrants in each state and represent the top 0.5% percent of the state’s senior students.&lt;ref name="Winners"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-myth-of-american-meritocracy/ | title=National Merit Scholarship Winners | format=PDF | accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be considered for a National Merit Scholarship, Semifinalists have to fulfill requirements to advance to Finalist standing. Each Semifinalist submits a detailed scholarship application, which includes essays and information about [[extracurricular activities|extracurricular achievements]], [[awards]], and [[leadership]] positions. Semifinalists also have to have an outstanding [[academic transcript|academic record]], be endorsed and recommended by a school official, and earn SAT scores that confirm their qualifying test performance. From the Semifinalist group, a certain number of students, varying from year to year, advance to Finalist standing depending on the above criteria. By the conclusion of the competition, a select group of Finalists are chosen to receive prestigious National Merit Scholarships totaling nearly $35 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcement of National Merit Scholarship Winners|url=http://www.nationalmerit.org/11_Merit2500Scholar.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709134013/http://www.nationalmerit.org/11_Merit2500Scholar.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-07-09|publisher=National Merit Scholarship Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winners are the Finalist candidates judged to have the strongest combination of academic skills and achievements, extracurricular accomplishments, and potential for success in rigorous university studies. Scholarship winners represent fewer than 1% of the initial pool of student entrants, based on official statistics released by the National Merit Scholarship Corporation.&lt;ref name="Winners" /&gt;

== Program entry requirements ==
To enter the competition, a student must
*Be enrolled full-time as a high school student progressing normally toward completion of high school and planning to enroll full-time in college in the fall following the completion of high school;
*Be a citizen of the United States or be a U.S. lawful permanent resident who intends to become a U.S. citizen at the earliest opportunity allowed by law, or have applied for permanent residency with the intention of becoming a U.S. citizen at the earliest possible opportunity and have not been denied; and
*Take the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test ([[PSAT/NMSQT]]) in the specified year of the high school program, usually the junior (11th grade) year and usually at one's own school. Students completing high school in three (3) years or less must be in the last or next-to-last year of high school when they take the test. Students unable to take the exam because of an extenuating circumstance, such as severe illness or natural disaster, may be permitted to substitute subsequent [[SAT]] results by making arrangements with NMSC no later than March 1 following the exam that was missed.

== Competition rounds ==

=== PSAT/NMSQT ===
The NMSC uses the PSAT/NMSQT as the initial screen of over 1.5 million program entrants. In the spring of the junior year, NMSC determines a national Selection Index qualifying score (critical reading + math + writing skills scores) for "Commended" recognition, which is calculated each year to yield students at about the 96th percentile (top 50,000 highest scorers). Up until 2016 (when the College Board changed the format and style of the PSAT),&lt;ref&gt;https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt-psat-10/inside-the-test/compare-specifications&lt;/ref&gt; scores in the 200s (out of 240) often qualified for recognition; however, with the New SAT and PSAT format and grading system, which is out of 228 (not 240, which is what it was on the old PSAT), qualifying scores for commendation are about 207, but qualifying levels change annually depending on how the top approximately 50,000 high scorers fared.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.prepscholar.com/does-your-psat-score-qualify-for-national-merit&lt;/ref&gt;  Qualification levels also vary by state, and qualifying levels are higher in competitive states such as New Jersey and Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeplanningsimplified.com/NationalMerit.html|title=National Merit Scholarships|accessdate=28 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528234112/http://www.collegeplanningsimplified.com/NationalMerit.html|archivedate=28 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2009/2010 school year, a score of 217 was required in California to qualify.  Notification is mailed to school principals in April regarding students who scored at or above this level. The principals then notify their students of their status. These students are given the opportunity to identify two colleges or universities to which they would like NMSC to send their scores.

=== Semifinalist ===
Early the next September (beginning of the senior year, almost a year after the PSAT/NMSQT was taken), NMSC determines Selection Index qualifying scores for further recognition by state (including three other areas: DC, US Territories and Commonwealths, and students enrolled in schools outside the US) and US boarding schools (by geographic region). About 16,000 of the 50,000 are recognized as National Merit Semifinalists in this process. The Selection Index qualifying scores for Semifinalist standing vary from state to state and from year to year. Each state is allocated a percentage of Semifinalists based on the percentage of that state's graduating seniors out of the nation's total. The National Merit Scholarship Corporation does not release to the public the minimum qualifying score required per state.  In August after the PSAT was taken, high school principals are mailed notification about their Semifinalists. Principals communicate these results to their students, though some misread the NMSC materials and do not release them until the NMSC press release, which comes in mid-September. Those not making Semifinalist are "Commended", and receive a Letter of Commendation; they do not continue in the competition for Merit Scholarship awards.

=== Finalist ===
Semifinalists must fulfill additional requirements and advance to the Finalist level of the competition to be considered for a scholarship. Approximately 15,000 of the 16,000 Semifinalists advance to Finalist standing by submitting SAT scores that confirm the earlier PSAT/NMSQT performance, having an outstanding academic record, and being endorsed and recommended by a high school official. They must also submit an application that includes high school courses and grades, extracurricular and volunteer activities, and a self-descriptive essay. The information that is collected about each Semifinalist is used later in the process to choose scholarship winners. All Finalists receive a Certificate of Merit in recognition of their outstanding performance in the competition.

=== Scholarships ===
Of the 15,000 Finalists, about 8,000 receive Merit Scholarship awards. All Finalists are considered for one of the 2,500 National Merit $2,500 Scholarships. National Merit $2,500 Scholarship winners are the Finalists in each state judged to have the strongest combination of accomplishments, skills, and potential for success in rigorous college studies. The number of winners named in each state is proportional to the state’s percentage of the nation’s graduating high school seniors. These Scholars were selected by a committee of college admissions officers and high school counselors, who appraised a substantial amount of information submitted by both the Finalists and their high schools: the academic record, including difficulty level of subjects studied and grades earned; scores from two standardized tests; contributions and leadership in school and community activities; an essay written by the Finalist; and a recommendation written by a high school official. NMSC's own funds support the majority of these awards but corporate sponsors help underwrite these awards with grants they provide to NMSC in lieu of paying administrative fees. About 1,100 Merit Scholarship awards are provided by corporate sponsors for Finalists who meet criteria specified by the sponsor. Most of these awards are for children of the sponsor's employees, for Finalists living in a particular geographic area, or for Finalists who have career plans the sponsor wishes to encourage. These two types of awards can be used at any regionally accredited college or university in the United States. There are also approximately 4,600 college-sponsored Merit Scholarship awards for Finalists who plan to attend a sponsor college. Finalists report to NMSC their first choice college (College-Sponsored Merit Awards). In addition, about 1,500 program participants who are below the Finalist level receive Special Scholarships provided by corporate sponsors.

To receive a scholarship payment, a Merit Scholarship winner must (a) notify NMSC of plans to enroll in a college or university in the United States that holds accredited status with a regional accrediting commission on higher education, and (b) plan to enroll full-time in an undergraduate course of study leading to a traditional baccalaureate degree. NMSC scholarship stipends are not payable for attendance at [[United States service academies]], distance learning programs, and certain institutions that are limited in their purposes or training. A number of National Merit Scholars do not receive a monetary award because their educational plans or other awards preclude receipt of a monetary scholarship; however, these students may be honored as Honorary Merit Scholars, a designation that acknowledges achievement without providing any financial assistance.

== National Achievement Scholarship Program ==

The National Achievement® Scholarship Program was established in 1964, contemporaneously with the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], specifically to encourage Black American youth to continue their education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmerit.org/s/1758/interior.aspx?sid=1758&amp;gid=2&amp;pgid=433 NMSQ National Achievement Scholarship Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its half century of existence, more than four million African-Americans have entered the program. Approximately 228,000 have received program recognition, and more than 34,000 of the most outstanding participants were chosen to receive Achievement Scholarship® awards.

Prior to 2016, black students who met entry requirements and requested consideration when they took the PSAT/NMSQT could enter both the National Achievement Scholarship Program and the National Merit Program. The two programs were conducted concurrently; however, a student's standing in each program was determined independently. Black students could qualify for recognition, become candidates for awards, and be honored as Scholars in both competitions, but they could receive only one monetary award from NMSC. Students who were chosen as both National Achievement and National Merit Scholars received the monetary award that was most advantageous to them and were recognized as Honorary Scholars in the other program.

With the conclusion of the 2015 program, the National Achievement Scholarship Program transitioned to the [[United Negro College Fund]], which will use program funds to honor and award financial assistance to high-achieving, underrepresented college graduates through the newly designed Achievement Capstone Program.

Because Achievement Scholarship funds are being redirected to awards for college graduates, Black American high school students no longer have the opportunity to compete for Achievement Scholarship awards. However, they may still enter the National Merit® Scholarship competition, and they may be eligible to receive awards from the United Negro College Fund after college graduation.

==College enrollment==
A number of universities reserve or guarantee additional merit-based funding for students who are National Merit Scholars, Finalists or Semifinalists. The National Merit Scholarship Corporation releases annual reports displaying the number of award winners enrolled at specific universities, which some believe encourage competition to attract students in this select group. Secondary schools may also publish information related to their students, in order to augment perception on teaching quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NMSC 2010–2011 Annual Report|url=http://www.nationalmerit.org/annual_report.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612233017/http://nationalmerit.org/annual_report.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-06-12|publisher=National Merit Scholarship Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following lists the fifteen universities that enroll the greatest number of National Merit Scholars according to the 2016-17 Annual Report of the National Merit Scholarship Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nationalmerit.org/s/1758/images/gid2/editor_documents/annual_report.pdf?gid=2&amp;pgid=61&lt;/ref&gt; (''total scholars including college-sponsored scholars/college-sponsored scholars alone'')

== Criticism ==
Under the umbrella of their professional organization, the [[National Association for College Admission Counseling]] (NACAC), college and university admissions officers have strongly criticized the National Merit Scholarship Corporation's use of only one measure—the PSAT/NMSQT—to pre-screen students for National Merit recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacacnet.org/PublicationsResources/Marketplace/research/Pages/TestingCommissionReport.aspx |title=Report of the Commission on the Use of Standardized Tests in Undergraduate Admission |publisher=National Association for College Admission Counseling |accessdate=May 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426050457/http://www.nacacnet.org/PublicationsResources/Marketplace/research/Pages/TestingCommissionReport.aspx |archivedate=April 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NACAC's position was emphasized in a July 2009 announcement, which stated the following:
"Implementing the recommendations of its blue-ribbon Testing Commission, the National Association for College Admissions Counseling (NACAC) has called on the National Merit Scholarship Corporation (NMSC) and the College Board to stop using PSAT scores as the initial screen for the country’s most prestigious academic awards."

In public letters to the test’s co-sponsors, NACAC charged that eliminating 99% of test-takers from the National Merit Scholarship competition solely on the basis of a multiple-choice, standardized exam was “at odds with best practices in the use of admissions test scores.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NACAC Joins National Merit Critics|url=http://fairtest.org/nacac-joins-national-merit-critics|publisher=The National Center for Fair and Open Testing}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be eligible for scholarships, high school juniors must score among the top 1% of test-takers in their home state. The PSAT serves as the National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (NMSQT), and measures [[critical reading]] ability, [[mathematics]] problem solving ability and [[writing]] ability, rather than existing knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=College Board – About PSAT/NMSQT|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/psat/about.html|publisher=College Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms were challenged by both the [[College Board]] and the National Merit Scholarship Corporation.

FairTest (National Center for Fair and Open Testing) has also voiced concerns about the level of transparency in the National Merit Scholarship Corporation's selection process. In February 2010, it issued an announcement stating the following:
"The National Merit Scholarship Corporation (NMSC), which runs the country’s most prestigious tuition aid competition, is trying to block internet posting of state-by-state test score requirements for its awards." [[FairTest]], however, has been criticized for its lack of credentials, unnamed sources of funding, and generalized claims associated with standardized exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's Wrong with Standardized Tests?|url=http://fairtest.org/whats-wrong-standardized-tests|publisher=National Center for Fair and Open Testing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additional criticism exists in that the National Merit Scholarship Corporation (NMSC) does not publish information regarding scholarship winners by year by state.

'''Nicaraguan exceptionalism''' (Spanish: ''Excepcionalismo Nicaragüense'') is a belief that [[Nicaragua]] is an exceptional nation, different from its [[Central American]] neighbors, despite shared history in the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] and regional integration in the [[Central American Integration System]].&lt;ref name="utexas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/insts/llilas/events/32246|title=UT College of Liberal Arts|date=7 November 2014|publisher=Utexas.edu|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept differs from the exceptionalism of other nations primarily as its basis rests solely upon the actions and institutions implemented since the [[Sandanista]] government took power in the [[Nicaraguan Revolution|1979 revolution]], and again in 2006 after passing power to the [[National Opposition Union]]. The difference here is, most nationalist claims to [[exceptionalism]] originate from the founding of nations and/or the development of their cultures due to long histories.

The widely regarded exception within the current panorama of dystopian violence afflicting contemporary Central America, Nicaragua is often hailed as "the safest (sano) country in Latin America (despite also being the poorest)".&lt;ref name="utexas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panoramas.pitt.edu/content/violence-migration-and-nicaragua-exception|title=Of Violence, Migration, and the Nicaragua Exception|publisher=Panoramas.pitt.edu|accessdate=7 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107051010/http://www.panoramas.pitt.edu/content/violence-migration-and-nicaragua-exception|archivedate=7 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other exceptionalism claims include the concept that Nicaragua is highly resistant to [[drug trafficking]] as compared even to richer neighbors like [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]]. Even Western media have drawn on this notion in reporting on why Nicaraguan children are not migrating to the United States in the [[2014 American immigration crisis]] to flee drug trafficking violence (despite that there is heavy [[Nicaraguans#Nicaraguans_in_Costa_Rica|Nicaraguan immigration to neighboring Costa Rica]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alex-nowrasteh/nicaragua-child-migrants-us_b_5592209.html|title=Why Aren't Child Migrants Fleeing to the U.S. From Nicaragua?|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''North American Phalanx''' was a secular [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] [[commune]] located in [[Colts Neck Township, New Jersey|Colts Neck Township]], [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]], [[New Jersey]]. The community was the longest-lived of about 30 [[List of Fourierist Associations in the United States|Fourierist Associations in the United States]] which emerged during a brief burst of popularity during the decade of the 1840s.

The North American Phalanx was established in September 1843 and included the active participation of writer [[Albert Brisbane]] and newspaper publisher [[Horace Greeley]], two of the leading figures of the [[Charles Fourier|Fourierist]] movement. The Association was disbanded in January 1856, following a catastrophic fire which destroyed a number of the community's productive enterprises. At the time of its termination it was the last of about 30 Fourierist Associations established during the 1840s still in existence and thus was the longest-lived.

The main residential dwelling of the phalanx, a three-story wooden structure, stood vacant until it was itself destroyed by fire in November 1972.

==History==

===Background===
[[File:72-NorthAmericanPhalanx-interior.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Interior view of a main floor room of the residential building, taken more than a century after the termination of the North American Phalanx]]

[[Charles Fourier]] (1772–1837) was a [[France|French]] philosopher who believed that the structure of modern civilization led to poverty, unemployment, isolation, and unhappiness and that people would be better off living in organized communal societies rather than individual family units. Fourier developed the idea of the [[phalanstère]], a collectively dwelling and cooperatively working community of 1,620 people organized on the basis of a [[joint stock company]].

While never pursued in France during his lifetime, Fourier's ideas found practical realization in the United States in the 1840s and early 1850s as a result of the books and newspaper columns of [[Albert Brisbane]] (1809–1890). It was Brisbane who translated, distilled, and adapted Fourier's ideas for an American audience, largely through the pages of [[Horace Greeley]]'s ''[[New York Tribune]],'' stirring popular enthusiasm for the French intellectual's ideas for the formation of local associations, known as "phalanxes."

Early in 1843 a general call was issued in [[New York City]] by Brisbane, Greeley, and others, seeking local organizations of [[Fourierism|Fourierist]] groups.&lt;ref name=Sears3&gt;Charles Sears, [https://archive.org/details/TheNorthAmericanPhalanx ''The North American Phalanx: An Historical and Descriptive Sketch.''] Prescott, WI: John M. Pryse, 1886; pg. 3. The Sears history of the North American Phalanx appears to have been prepared in December 1852 at the request of pioneer historian of the cooperative movement A.J. Macdonald with a subsequent amendment describing termination of the enterprise. See: Noyes, ''History of American Socialisms,'' pg. 450.&lt;/ref&gt; This call inspired the formation in the summer of 1843 of a group calling itself the [[Albany, New York|Albany]] Branch of the North American Phalanx.&lt;ref name=Sears3 /&gt; About 20 families participated in the official planning of the group, of which about a dozen families formally subscribed to the draft constitution,&lt;ref name=Sears3 /&gt; on August 12, 1843.&lt;ref name=Hinds266&gt;William Alfred Hinds, [https://archive.org/details/AmericanCommunitiesAndCo-operativeColonies ''American Communities and Co-operative Colonies,''] Second Edition. Chicago: Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co., 1908; pg. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was believed by the first participants that considerable capital would be raised for establishment of an American cooperative association and that a number of other branch organizations would emerge throughout the New York region, inspired by the Albany group's activity and success.&lt;ref name=Sears3 /&gt; Neither of these expectations were realized, however, as it was only with great difficulty that a sum just under $7,000 was raised and no other local associations would immediately follow.&lt;ref name=Sears3 /&gt; Moreover, a majority of the phalanx's financing came from outside sources, as over time 61% of the association's stock would be held by outsiders, including 527 shares held by a sympathetic consortium of merchants from New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite clearly inadequate resources, the Albany Branch, headed by Charles Sears and Nathan Starks, decided to persevere and a search began for suitable agricultural lands upon which a local phalanstry might be established.

===Establishment===
[[File:72-NorthAmericanPhalanx-stairway.jpg|thumb|right|Interior view of a stairway inside the residential edifice of the North American Phalanx, taken shortly before the building's destruction by fire]]

A domain of {{convert|673|acre|km2}} was located near the small town of [[Red Bank, New Jersey]], priced at $14,000.&lt;ref name=Sears4&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Of this sum $5,000 of the community's funds were invested as a [[down payment]], leaving a mortgage of $9,000 to be repaid over time.&lt;ref name=Sears4 /&gt; Barely $2,000 remained for the construction of buildings and the purchase of working animals, farm implements, and other necessary goods.&lt;ref name=Sears4 /&gt;

Colonization began in September 1843, with six families crowded into two houses previously existing on the property.&lt;ref name=Sears4 /&gt; Temporary housing was rapidly constructed to provide accommodations for the rest of the party that winter.&lt;ref name=Sears4 /&gt;

Others arrived at the site in the spring of 1844, with a total of 100 people as part of 20 families in residence by the end of that year.&lt;ref name=Sears4 /&gt; At its peak the community would eventually count about 150 people in residence, including children, usually ranging between 120 and that number.&lt;ref name=Sears4 /&gt;

After one year of existence a saw-mill had been constructed and was nearly ready for operation, and a blacksmith shop and a machine shop powered by a steam engine were already operational.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to the Convention of Associations, published in ''The Phalanx,'' Dec. 9, 1844. Reprinted in Hinds, ''American Communities and Co-operative Colonies,'' pp. 266-267.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the community included stables, animal and wagon sheds, carpentry shops, a school and children's day care area, guest cottages, landscaped gardens and paths, and an artificial pond for bathing, boating and a supply of ice in the winter.&lt;ref name=Densky&gt;Lois R. Densky and Gregory J. Plunges, [http://www.monmouthhistory.org/Sections-read-20.html "North American Phalanx Records, 1841-1972,"] Monmouth County Historical Association, Library and Archives Manuscript Collections, Collection 5, May 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the household heads living in the North American Phalanx at the time of its formation had either passing or practical knowledge of agriculture.&lt;ref name=Sears4 /&gt; The land was deemed quite suitable for fruit farming and a good percentage of the available land was subsequently committed to fruit trees, including apples, peaches, pears, and [[quince]].&lt;ref name=Sears4 /&gt; In addition grape vines were planted.&lt;ref name=Sears4 /&gt;

In 1847 a new three-story addition was constructed, adding common area. Together with a pair of long halls, the phalanx subsequently had housing sufficient for each family to be allotted a parlor and two bedrooms.&lt;ref name=Hinds267&gt;Hinds, ''American Communities and Co-operative Colonies,'' pg. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; A 70-foot long restaurant was also constructed at the same time.

The North American Phalanx was moderately successful during its first seven years of operation, paying annual dividends ranging from 4.4% to 5.6% on capital invested, as well as hourly wages to all workers of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Hinds, ''American Communities and Co-operative Colonies,'' pg. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor and compensation===

In accordance with the Fourierian scheme, labor was divided into general departments, called "series," of which there were six at the North American Phalanx: agriculture, livestock, manufacturing, domestic work, education, and "festal" (entertainment).&lt;ref name=Sears5&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Within each of these there were additional subdivisions called "groups," consisting of 3 to 7 people, who would work cooperatively on specific given tasks.&lt;ref name=Sears5 /&gt; For example, the agricultural serie &lt;!---this is the correct terminology according to the source---&gt; included four groups: farming, market gardening, orchard, and experimental.&lt;ref name=Sears5 /&gt; Additional groups not associated with any series were formed for performance of special "repugnant" work and the care of visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these groups elected a chief, who kept track of labor time and who represented it at meetings with other group chiefs at meetings of the department, called the "council."&lt;ref name=Sears5 /&gt; Council members in turn elected a chief, who served as general manager of the department and presiding officer at meetings of the council.&lt;ref name=Sears5 /&gt; These general managers each met daily as part of a body called the Industrial Council, which determined jobs needing to be done the following day.&lt;ref name=Sears6&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic work was performed by women, with the organized subdivision of domestic tasks practiced in accordance with the model used for other series.&lt;ref name=Sears6 /&gt;

At the end of each year, proceeds of the year's production would be calculated and — in accordance with the Fourierian scheme — awards for capital, labor, and talent allocated. By way of example, rates of 5% on capital invested and $1 per ten-hour day for "ordinary" labor were in force at the end of the North American Phalanx's existence.&lt;ref name=Sears7&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs were compensated at three levels, with exhausting or repugnant jobs earning a premium and light and attractive jobs being docked a penalty.&lt;ref name=Sears7 /&gt; In addition bonuses were awarded or demerits assessed for the excellence or lack of skill of performance.&lt;ref name=Sears7 /&gt;

Each group rated its own members for purposes of compensation, with labor performance rather than age or gender the determining factor in setting wage rates.&lt;ref name=Sears7 /&gt;

While the community initially attempted to make payment to its members in cash, with money tied up in land and property and the supply of paper money erratic, a move to the issuance of [[scrip]] was soon made.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; This "house currency" was of the same general size and appearance as regular paper money of the day, but featured a central bust of Charles Fourier.&lt;ref name=Sears8&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Wages and assessments for room and board were made monthly, with scrip used as tender to settle the balances of  all such accounts.&lt;ref name=Sears8 /&gt;

===Daily life===

Collective living and rational division of domestic responsibility was a primary tenet of Fourierism. During its first two or three years of existence, extreme frugality was deemed necessary, and only "scanty" meals were served at the common table.&lt;ref name=Sears10&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was further complicated by the presence of significant numbers of associationists with specific dietary beliefs, including contingents of [[vegetarianism|vegetarians]] and Christian sectarians who foreswore the use of [[veganism|all products produced at the cost of a sacrifice of life]].&lt;ref name=Sears10 /&gt; The effect was disruptive, with the moderate and extreme vegetarians agitating against the slaughter of animals and the consumption of meat.&lt;ref name=Sears11&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dietary dilemma was ultimately resolved by the establishment of a restaurant in lieu of a common table and a move towards providing board on a priced a la carte basis rather than through a unified menu.&lt;ref name=Sears11 /&gt; The pricing out of food had the additional beneficial aspect of reducing the amount of waste according to North American Phalanx president Charles Sears.&lt;ref name=Sears11 /&gt;

Just as there was difference in eating habits, a range of religious affiliations existed among the North American Phalanx's resident members. Included among the community's ranks were [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Quakers]], [[Baptists]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]], [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Shakers]], as well as agnostics and atheists.&lt;ref name=Sears12&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; While religious matters were frequently the object of discussion and debate, heated division over religious topics does not seem to have occurred in the community until 1853, with the climate sharpening as the end of the institution approached.&lt;ref name=Sears12 /&gt;

The phalanx maintained a nursery for younger children as well as a school for older children, the combination of which served to significantly reduce the domestic duties of female members.&lt;ref name=Sears15&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were made to build an appreciation for collectivist ideals in the minds of the community's 30 to 40 children, with children and youth encouraged to work cooperatively in organizing amusements, forest expeditions, camping trips, and craft projects.&lt;ref name=Sears15 /&gt;

Community entertainment was more formally organized in 1849 with the formation of a "festal series" in charge of staging musical concerts, dramatic presentations, and dances.&lt;ref name=Guarneri215&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the community had a vibrant informal social atmosphere, with nightly walks in the woods, card games, and singing around the piano.&lt;ref name=Guarneri215 /&gt; Members read Greeley's ''New York Tribune'' and other newspapers, agricultural publications, and maintained a reading room.&lt;ref name=Guarneri214&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; A steady stream of visitors infused new ideas and earnest discussions into the small rural society.&lt;ref name=Guarneri214 /&gt; The atmosphere of the North American Phalanx and other Fourierist Associations which survived more than a year or two resembled that of a vibrant New England farming village, it was later reckoned.&lt;ref name=Guarneri214 /&gt;

===Governance===

The phalanx's 1843 constitution provided for administration through a central council, composed of a president, vice-president, treasurer, and 12 directors, with the executive officers serving one year terms and the council members serving staggered two year terms.  Originally, only stockholders voted in elections for the council, but all members were given a vote in an 1848 amendment. Heads of each series were granted ''ex officio'' status as members of the central council.&lt;ref name=Sears6 /&gt;

Suffrage was universal both industrially and politically, with any regular working member of a group entitled to vote within that group without regard to gender.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===

The North American Phalanx, like the Fourierist movement in general, was ultimately undermined by its unachievable utopian basis — a general creed which as one scholar observed "promised too much and required too little of its adherents."&lt;ref name=Guarneri175&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The disparity between promises of social transformation and economic abundance and the realities of primitive agriculture and crude living conditions ended with the disillusionment of starry-eyed communitarians and their inflated expectations.&lt;ref name=Guarneri175 /&gt; Work was hard, the process of development slow and difficult, and communal life in close quarters presented a whole host of social pressures which undermined community stability.&lt;ref name=Guarneri175 /&gt;

The Fourierist model of labor division and wage calculation also proved inefficient in practice, with president Charles Sears noting that members of the North American Phalanx were so preoccupied with work allocation and scheduling that "our days were spent in labor and our nights in legislation" — a regimen which sapped the vitality of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in John Humphrey Noyes, [https://archive.org/details/historyofamerica00innoye ''History of American Socialisms.''] Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott &amp; Co., 1880; pg. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; The community's unity was also undermined by an inequality of workloads and compensation, as Carl Guarneri has observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"For Fourier, the notion that some Harmonians would work less than others demonstrated true passional freedom; life in the American phalanxes, however, required hard work and self-sacrifice. As their communities struggled through indebtedness, chronic shortages, and crop failures, Associationists found themselves undermined by their own propaganda.... The phalanxes never solved the problem of what to do about those who did not assume their share of the work."&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wage rates were another source of discord, with machine operators formally complaining in 1853 that their wages paid as members of the phalanx ran significantly behind wages paid for comparable work in competitive industry outside the association.&lt;ref name=Sears11 /&gt; Moreover, the wages paid to working members of the phalanx proved barely adequate to cover room, board, and clothing for families with children — causing the loss of many of the same and the undermining of hopes of passing the community to a new generation.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

The North American Phalanx was also hard hit by the loss of its chief carpenter, a skilled horticulturalist, and other leading members in an 1853 succession to join the fledgling [[Raritan Bay Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pp. 325-326.&lt;/ref&gt; In short order Raritan Bay members and financial supporters owned fully one-sixth of the North American Phalanx's stock, further weakening the older phalanx's resolve to continue.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissolution===
[[Image:Phalanx.JPG|thumb|300px|Historic marker located at the site of the former North American Phalanx]]

Disaster came on September 10, 1854, when a fire swept the colony's mill and all its contents.&lt;ref name=Sears16&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; No insurance was recovered, and the community found itself facing $30,000 in accumulated debt with no ready means of repayment.&lt;ref name=Sears16 /&gt; Of this, some $9,000 remained unpaid on the original mortgage, with additional bills accumulated for a new engine and boiler for the mill.&lt;ref name=Sears18&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, at the time of the fire the mill had housed a large quantity of wheat purchased on credit, for which the phalanx was financially responsible.

While Horace Greeley offered to loan the association $12,000 for construction of a replacement facility,&lt;ref&gt;Hinds, ''American Communities and Co-operative Colonies,'' pg. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; members of the phalanx ultimately decided not to take advantage of this offer, which would have boosted the debt load and necessitated another arduous reconstruction period.&lt;ref name=Sears16 /&gt; Instead, starting with the January 1855 stockholders' meeting, plans began to be made either to sell part of the phalanx's land to satisfy debt or to sell the community in whole.&lt;ref name=Guarneri327&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were made to sell the phalanx to a group organizing around Fourierist adherent [[Victor Considerant]] to act as a staging point for newcomers to his new colonization project in the state of Texas.&lt;ref name=Guarneri327 /&gt; No such agreement could be reached however.&lt;ref name=Guarneri327 /&gt;

Instead in June 1855 the stockholders voted that the community should liquidate its assets and terminate its existence.&lt;ref name=Sears18 /&gt; In October community land was surveyed and divided into parcels ranging in size from 5 to 150 acres and sold at auction, together with all movable property.&lt;ref name=Sears18 /&gt; A total of $80,000 was raised from the sale of the North American Phalanx's land and property,&lt;ref name=Sears16 /&gt; with the proceeds divided and disbursed to the stockholders, who received 57.33 cents per dollar invested in the liquidation.&lt;ref name=Sears18 /&gt;

In January 1856 the North American Phalanx — the sole survivor of the Fourierist boom of the 1840s — was formally terminated.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===

The North American Phalanx was the second most publicized association of the 1840s Fourierist movement, surpassed in general interest only by [[Brook Farm]] in [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Hinds266 /&gt;

The main edifice of the North American Phalanx stood until November 1972 when it was destroyed in another fire. At present, two structures – both private homes – from the original Phalanx property survive. One of them, constructed around 1851, was the cottage of Marcus Spring, a merchant from Brooklyn, New York, who was a supporter of the Phalanx. He and his family used the cottage as their summer home.  Although Mr. Spring was not a resident member of the Phalanx, he was one of its largest shareholders, having invested, with several New York colleagues, over $50,000 in the endeavor.

The [[Monmouth County Historical Association]] in [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey]] houses a collection of records of the North American Archive which include legal and financial documents, meeting minutes, miscellaneous manuscripts, published material about the phalanx, photographs and illustrations, maps, drawings, and blueprints.&lt;ref name=Densky /&gt; The collection contains a total of 148 items and occupies 2 linear feet of shelf space and is open for use by researchers without restriction.&lt;ref name=Densky /&gt;

[[File:Santarem carfree.JPG|thumb|right|[[Sett (paving)|Stone]] paving in [[Santarém, Portugal]]]]
'''Permeable paving''' is a method of paving vehicle and pedestrian pathways that allows for infiltration of fluids.  In pavement design the base is the top portion of the roadway that pedestrians or vehicles come into contact with.  The media used for the base of permeable paving may be porous, to allow for fluids to flow through it, or nonporous media that are spaced so that fluid may flow in between the gaps. In addition to reducing [[surface runoff]], permeable paving can trap suspended solids therefore filtering pollutants from stormwater.&lt;ref&gt;Interlocking Concrete Pavement Institute, http://www.icpi.org/sustainable&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include roads, paths, and [[parking lot]]s that are subject to light vehicular traffic, such as [[cycle-path]]s, service or emergency access lanes, road and airport shoulders, and residential [[sidewalks]] and driveways.

Although some porous paving materials appear nearly indistinguishable from nonporous materials, their environmental effects are qualitatively different.  Whether it is [[pervious concrete]], porous [[asphalt]], [[Paving stone (flooring)|paving stones]] or concrete or plastic-based pavers, all these permeable paving systems allow [[stormwater]] to percolate and infiltrate the surface areas, bypassing the traditionally [[impervious surface|impervious]] materials to the soil below. The goal is to control stormwater at the source, reduce runoff and improve water quality by filtering pollutants in the substrata layers.

== Description and applications ==
Permeable solutions can be based on: porous asphalt and concrete surfaces, concrete pavers (permeable interlocking concrete paving systems – PICP), or polymer-based grass pavers, grids and geocells. Porous pavements and concrete pavers (actually the voids in-between them) enable stormwater to drain through a stone base layer for on-site infiltration and filtering. Polymer based grass grid or cellular paver systems provide load bearing reinforcement for unpaved surfaces of gravel or turf.

Grass pavers, plastic turf reinforcing grids (PTRG), and geocells ([[cellular confinement systems]]) are honeycombed 3D grid-cellular systems, made of thin-walled [[HDPE]] plastic or other polymer alloys. These provide grass reinforcement, ground stabilization and gravel retention. The 3D structure reinforces infill and transfers vertical loads from the surface, distributing them over a wider area. Selection of the type of cellular grid depends to an extent on the surface material, traffic and loads. The cellular grids are installed on a prepared base layer of open-graded stone (higher void spacing) or engineered stone (stronger). The surface layer may be compacted gravel or topsoil seeded with grass and fertilizer. In addition to load support, the cellular grid reduces compaction of the soil to maintain permeability, while the roots improve permeability due to their root channels.&lt;ref&gt;Stormwater Management, http://www.epa.gov/oaintrnt/stormwater/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In new suburban growth, porous pavements protect [[drainage basin|watersheds]] by delaying and filtering the surge flow. In existing built-up areas and towns, redevelopment and reconstruction are opportunities to implement stormwater water management practices. Permeable paving is an important component in [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|Low Impact Development]] (LID), a process for [[land development]] in the United States that attempts to minimize impacts on [[water quality]] and the similar concept of [[sustainable drainage system]]s (SuDS) in the United Kingdom.

The [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] capacity of the native soil is a key design consideration for determining the depth of base rock for stormwater storage or for whether an underdrain system is needed.

== Advantages ==

=== Managing runoff ===

Permeable paving surfaces have been demonstrated as effective in managing [[surface runoff|runoff]] from [[Impervious Surfaces|paved surfaces]].&lt;ref&gt;Brattebo, B. O., and D. B. Booth. 2003. [http://depts.washington.edu/cwws/Research/Reports/permeableparking.pdf "Long-Term Stormwater Quantity and Quality Performance of Permeable Pavement Systems."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327123757/http://depts.washington.edu/cwws/Research/Reports/permeableparking.pdf |date=2007-03-27 }} ''[[Water Research]].'' 37: 4369–4376. {{DOI|10.1016/S0043-1354(03)00410-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, D.C. [http://www.epa.gov/owow/NPS/pavements.pdf "Field Evaluation of Permeable Pavements for Stormwater Management, Olympia, Washington."] Fact Sheet. October 2000. Document No. EPA-841-B-00-005B.&lt;/ref&gt; Large volumes of [[urban runoff]] causes serious [[erosion]] and [[silt]]ation in [[surface water]] bodies. Permeable pavers provide a solid ground surface, strong enough to take heavy loads, like large vehicles, while at the same time they allow water to filter through the surface and reach the underlying soils, mimicking natural ground absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chesapeakeecologycenter.org/?page_id=78|title=Permeable Pavers|website=www.chesapeakeecologycenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can reduce downstream flooding and stream bank erosion, and maintain base flows in rivers to keep ecosystems self-sustaining. Permeable pavers also combat erosion that occurs when grass is dry or dead, by replacing grassed areas in suburban and residential environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.belgard.com/knowledge_center/planning_materials/permeable_pavers|title=Permeable Pavers|last=Belgard|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controlling pollutants ===
Permeable paving surfaces keep the [[water pollution|pollutants]] in place in the soil or other material underlying the roadway, and allow water seepage to [[groundwater recharge]] while preventing the stream erosion problems. They capture the [[heavy metals]] that fall on them, preventing them from washing downstream and accumulating inadvertently in the environment. In the void spaces, naturally occurring [[micro-organisms]] digest car oils, leaving little but [[carbon dioxide]] and water. Rainwater infiltration is usually less than that of an impervious pavement with a separate stormwater management facility somewhere downstream. {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}.in areas where infiltration is not possible due to unsuitable soil conditions permeable pavements are used in the attenuation mode where water is retained in the pavement and slowly released to surface water systems between storm events.

=== Trees ===
Permeable pavements may give urban trees the rooting space they need to grow to full size. A "structural-soil" pavement base combines structural [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] with soil; a porous surface admits vital air and water to the rooting zone. This integrates healthy ecology and thriving cities, with the living tree canopy above, the city's traffic on the ground, and living tree roots below. The benefits of permeables on urban tree growth have not been conclusively demonstrated and many researchers have observed tree growth is not increased if construction practices compact materials before permeable pavements are installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Volder|first=A|author2=Watson, Viswanathan|title=Potential use of pervious concrete for maintaining existing mature trees during and after urban development|journal=Urban For. Urban Gree.|year=2009|volume=8|issue=4|pages=249–256|doi=10.1016/j.ufug.2009.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morgenroth|first=J|author2=Visser|title=Aboveground growth response of Platanus orientalis to porous pavements|journal=Arboriculture &amp; Urban Forestry|year=2011|volume=37|issue=1|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==

=== Runoff Volumes ===
Permeable pavements are designed to replace Effective Impervious Areas (EIAs), not to manage stormwater from other impervious surfaces on site. Use of this technique must be part of an overall on site management system for stormwater, and is not a replacement for other techniques.

During large storm event, the water table below the porous pavement can rise to a higher level, preventing the precipitation from being absorbed into the ground. Some additional water is stored in the open graded / crushed drain rock base, and remains until the subgrade can absorb the water. For clay-based soils, or other low to 'non'-draining soils, it is important to increase the depth of the crushed drain rock base to allow additional capacity for the water as it waits to be infiltrated.

The best way to prevent this problem is to understand the soil infiltration rate, and design the pavement and base depths to meet the volume of water. Or, allow for adequate rain water run off at the pavement design stage.

=== Pollutant load ===
Runoff across some land uses may become contaminated, where pollutant concentrations exceed those typically found in stormwater. These "hot spots" include commercial [[Plant nursery|plant nurseries]], [[recycling]] facilities, [[Filling station|fueling stations]], industrial storage, [[marina]]s, some outdoor [[Loading dock|loading facilities]], public works yards, hazardous materials generators (if containers are exposed to rainfall), vehicle service and maintenance areas, and vehicle and equipment washing and steam cleaning facilities. Since porous pavement is an infiltration practice, it should not be applied at stormwater hot spots due to the potential for groundwater contamination. All contaminated runoff should be prevented from entering municipal storm drain systems by using [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMPs) for the specific industry or activity.&lt;ref&gt;Capital Regional District. Victoria, BC. [http://www.crd.bc.ca/watersheds/regulations.htm "Regulating Stormwater Discharges."] Accessed 2010-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weight and traffic volumes ===
Reference sources differ on whether low or medium traffic volumes and weights are appropriate for porous pavements. For example, around truck loading docks and areas of high commercial traffic, porous pavement is sometimes cited as being inappropriate. However, given the variability of products available, the growing number of existing installations in North America and targeted research by both manufacturers and user agencies, the range of accepted applications seems to be expanding. Some concrete paver companies have developed products specifically for industrial applications. Working examples exist at fire halls, busy retail complex parking lots, and on public and private roads, including intersections in parts of North America with quite severe winter conditions.

=== Siting ===
Permeable pavements may not be appropriate when land surrounding or draining into the pavement exceeds a 20 percent slope, where pavement is down slope from buildings or where foundations have piped drainage at their footers. The key is to ensure that drainage from other parts of a site is intercepted and dealt with separately rather than being directed onto permeable surfaces.

=== Climate ===
Cold climates may present special challenges. Road salt contains chlorides that could migrate through the porous pavement into groundwater. Snow plow blades could catch block edges and damage surfaces. Sand cannot be used for snow and ice control on porous surfaces because it will plug the pores and reduce permeability.  Although there are design modifications to reduce the risks, infiltrating runoff may freeze below the pavement, causing frost heave. Another issue is spalling damage. Spalling damage exclusively occurs on porous concrete pavement from salt application during the winter season. Thus porous paving is suggested for warmer climates. However, other materials have proven to be effective, even lowering winter maintenance costs by preserving salt in the pavement itself. This also reduces the amount of storm water runoff that is contaminated with salt chlorides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://stormwater.wef.org/2012/01/porous-pavement-performance-in-cold-climates/|title=Porous Pavement Performance in Cold Climates - The Stormwater Report|date=2012-01-05|work=The Stormwater Report|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porous pavement designed to reduce frost heave and spalling damage has been used successfully in Norway. Furthermore, experience suggests that preventative measures with rapid drainage below porous surfaces be taken in order to increase the rate of snow melt above ground.

=== Cost ===
Some estimates put the cost of permeable paving at two to three times that of conventional asphalt paving. Using permeable paving, however, can reduce the cost of providing larger or more stormwater BMPs on site, and these savings should be factored into any cost analysis. In addition, the off-site environmental impact costs of not reducing on-site stormwater volumes and pollution have historically been ignored or assigned to other groups (local government parks, public works and environmental restoration budgets, fisheries losses, etc.) The City of [[Olympia, Washington]] is studying the use of pervious concrete quite closely and finding that new stormwater regulations are making it a viable alternative to storm water.

=== Longevity and maintenance ===
Some permeable pavements require frequent maintenance because grit or gravel can block the open pores. This is commonly done by industrial vacuums that suck up all the sediment. If maintenance is not carried out on a regular basis, the porous pavements can begin to function more like impervious surfaces. With more advanced paving systems the levels of maintenance needed can be greatly decreased, [[#Bound recycled glass porous pavement|elastomerically bound glass pavements]] requires less maintenance than regular concrete paving as the glass bound pavement has 50% more void space.

Plastic grid systems, if selected and installed correctly, are becoming more and more popular with local government maintenance personnel owing to the reduction in maintenance efforts: reduced gravel migration and weed suppression in public park settings.

Some permeable paving products are prone to damage from misuse, such as drivers who tear up patches of plastic &amp; gravel grid systems by "joy riding" on remote parking lots at night. The damage is not difficult to repair but can look unsightly in the meantime. Grass pavers require supplemental watering in the first year to establish the vegetation, otherwise they may need to be re-seeded. Regional climate also means that most grass applications will go dormant during the dry season. While brown vegetation is only a matter of aesthetics, it can influence public support for this type of permeable paving.

Traditional permeable concrete paving bricks tend to lose their color in relatively short time which can be costly to replace or clean and is mainly due to the problem of [[efflorescence]].

=== Efflorescence ===
{{Main|Efflorescence}}
Efflorescence is a hardened [[crystalline]] deposit of [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]], principally [[calcium carbonate]]s, which migrate from the center of concrete or masonry materials to the surface, where they form insoluble deposits that harden on the surface.  Efflorescence usually appears white, gray or black depending on the region.

Over time, efflorescence begins to degrade the overall appearance of masonry/concrete and may cause the surfaces to become slippery when exposed to moisture. If left unchecked, this efflorescence will harden whereby the calcium/lime deposits begin to affect the integrity of the cementitious surface by slowly eroding away the cement paste and aggregate.  In some cases it will also discolor stained or coated surfaces.

Efflorescence forms more quickly in areas that are exposed to excessive amounts of moisture, such as near pool decks, spas, and fountains or where irrigation runoff is present.  The affected regions become very slick when wet. This can be of serious concern especially as a public safety issue to individuals, principals and property owners by exposing them to possible injury and increased general liability claims.

Efflorescence remover chemicals can be used to remove calcium/lime build-up without damaging the integrity of the paving surface.

== Types of Permeable Pavement ==
Installation of porous pavements is no more difficult than that of dense pavements, but has different specifications and procedures which must be strictly adhered to. Nine different families of porous paving materials present distinctive advantages and disadvantages for specific applications. Here are examples:

=== Pervious concrete ===
{{main|Pervious concrete}}
Pervious concrete is widely available, can bear frequent traffic, and is universally accessible. Pervious concrete quality depends on the installer's knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name="Pervious Concrete"&gt;EPA. ''National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices.'' 2009-09-10. [http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;Rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=137&amp;minmeasure=5 "Pervious Concrete Pavement."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622224413/http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;Rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=137&amp;minmeasure=5 |date=2010-06-22 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plastic Grids ===
Plastic grids allow for a 100% porous system using structural grid systems for containing and stabilizing either gravel or turf. These grids come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on use; from pathways to commercial parking lots. These systems have been used readily in Europe for over a decade, but are gaining popularity in North America due to requirements by government for many projects to meet [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] environmental building standards. Plastic grid system are also  popular with homeowners due to their lower cost to install, ease of installation, and versatility. The ideal design for this type of grid system is a closed cell system, which prevents gravel/sand/turf from migrating laterally.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} It is also known as Grass pavers / Turf Pavers in India.&lt;ref name="Plastic Grids"&gt;[http://www.grasspavers.in "Grass Pavers"] / [http://www.turfpavers.in "Turf Pavers"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Porous asphalt ===
'''Porous asphalt''' is produced and placed using the same methods as conventional [[asphalt concrete]]; it differs in that fine (small) aggregates are omitted from the asphalt mixture. The remaining large, single-sized  aggregate particles leave open voids that give the material its porosity and permeability.

''Open-graded friction courses'' (OGFC) are a porous asphalt surface course used on highways to improve driving safety by removing water from the surface. Unlike a full-depth porous asphalt pavement, OGFCs do not drain water to the base of a pavement. Instead, they allow water to infiltrate the top 3/4 to 1.5 inch of the pavement and then drain out to the side of the roadway. This can improve the friction characteristics of the road and reducing road spray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Caltrans | authorlink1 = California Department of Transportation | title = Open Graded Friction Course Usage Guide | date = 8 Feb 2006 | year = 2008 | location = Sacramento, California | url = http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/Translab/ofpm/pdf/FrictionCourseGuide.pdf | accessdate = 2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Single-sized aggregate ===
'''Single-sized aggregate''' without any binder, e.g. loose gravel, stone-chippings, is another alternative. Although it can only be safely used in walkways and very low-speed, low-traffic settings, e.g. car-parks and drives, its potential cumulative area is great.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== Porous turf ===

'''Permeable clay brick pavements''' are fired clay brick units with open, permeable spaces between the units. Clay pavers provide a durable surface that allows stormwater runoff to permeate through the joints.

=== Resin bound paving ===
{{Main|Resin bound paving}}
'''Resin bound paving''' is a mixture of resin binder and aggregate.  Clear resin is used to fully coat each aggregate particle before laying.  Enough resin is used to allow each aggregate particle to adhere to one another and to the base yet leave voids for water to permeate through.  Resin bound paving provides a strong and durable surface that is suitable for pedestrian and vehicular traffic in applications such as pathways, driveways, car parks and access roads.

A '''police officer''', also known as an '''officer''', '''policeman''', '''policewoman''', '''cop''', '''police agent''', or a '''police employee'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.police-information.co.uk/policepay.htm#constables |title=Police ranks and pay in England and Wales |publisher=Police-information.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library/documents/police.htm |title=Police rank structure and other information in Scotland |publisher=Scotland.gov.uk |date=1994-12-31 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Warrant (law)|warranted]] law employee of a [[police|police force]]. In most countries, "police officer" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank. In some, the use of the rank "officer" is legally reserved for military personnel.

Police officers are generally charged with the apprehension of [[criminal]]s and the prevention and detection of [[crime]], protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an [[Police oath|oath]], and have the power to [[arrest]] people and [[police custody|detain them]] for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some officers are trained in special duties, such as [[counter-terrorism]], [[surveillance]], [[child protection]], [[Very Important Person|VIP]] [[Protective security units|protection]], [[Civil law (common law)|civil law enforcement]], and investigation techniques into major crime including [[fraud]], [[rape]], [[murder]], and [[drug trafficking]]. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to dissimulate as ordinary. In most countries police officers are given exemptions from certain laws to perform their duties. For example a officer may used force if necessary to arrest or detain a person when it would ordinarily be assault. Officers can also break road rules to perform their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dulaney, W. Marvin |title=Black Police in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yaseH2ICEX4C|year=1996|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-21040-2|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''police'' comes from the Greek ''politeia'' meaning [[government]], which came to mean its civil administration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/police?s=t definition of the word ''police'']&lt;/ref&gt; Police officers are those empowered by government to enforce the laws it creates. In [[The Federalist Papers]] ([[Federalist No. 51|#51]]), [[James Madison]] wrote ''"If men were pure, no government would be necessary."''These words apply to those who serve government, including police.

The more general term for the function is [[law enforcement officer]] or peace officer. A [[sheriff]] is typically the top police officer of a county, with that word coming from the person enforcing law over a [[shire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/sheriff?s=t definition of the word ''sheriff'']&lt;/ref&gt; A person who has been deputized to serve the function of the sheriff is referred to as the deputy. A common nickname for a police officer is ''cop''. The term ''copper'' is originally used in Britain to mean "someone who captures". (In British English the term Cop is recorded (Shorter Oxford Dictionary) in the sense of 'To Capture' from 1704, derived from the Latin 'Capere' via the Old French 'Caper'.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Partridge|first=Eric|title=A Dictionary of Historical Slang|year=1972|publisher=Penguin Books Ltd|isbn=014051046X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common myth is that it's a term referring to the police officer's buttons which are made of copper. The term ''County Mountie'' is used specifically in reference to county police officers or county sheriff's deputies [[Sheriffs in the United States|in the United States]]. As with [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Canadian Mounties]], the term ''mountie'' comes from police who serve while mounted on horseback (see [[cavalry]]).

==Duties and functions==
[[File:Irish police on lunchbreak.jpg|thumb|A group of Garda officers in the [[Republic of Ireland]]]]
[[File:West Midlands Police - Force Traffic Biker.jpg|thumb|A British police officer on a police motorbike]]

Responsibilities of a police officer are varied, and may differ greatly from within one political context to another. Typical duties relate to keeping the peace, law enforcement, protection of people and property and the investigation of crimes. Officers are expected to respond to a variety of situations that may arise while they are on duty. Rules and guidelines dictate how an officer should behave within the community, and in many contexts, restrictions are placed on what the uniformed officer wears. In some countries, [[rule making|rules and procedures]] dictate that a police officer is obliged to intervene in a criminal incident, even if they are off-duty. Police officers in nearly all countries retain their lawful powers while off duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://education-portal.com/articles/Police_Officer_Educational_Requirements_for_Police_Officers.html |title=Educational Requirements for Police Officers |work=education-portal.com |year=2011 |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the majority of [[Western world|Western]] legal systems, the major role of the police is to maintain order, keeping the peace through surveillance of the public, and the subsequent reporting and apprehension of suspected violators of the law. They also function to [[Deterrence (psychology)|discourage]] crimes through high-visibility policing, and most police forces have an investigative capability. Police have the legal authority to arrest and detain, usually granted by magistrates. Police officers also respond to emergency calls, along with routine [[community policing]].

Police are often used as an [[emergency service]] and may provide a public safety function at large gatherings, as well as in emergencies, [[Emergency preparedness|disasters]], [[search and rescue]] situations, and [[Car accident|road traffic collisions]]. To provide a prompt response in emergencies, the police often coordinate their operations with [[firefighting|fire]] and [[emergency medical service]]s. In some countries, individuals serve jointly as police officers as well as firefighters (creating the role of [[fire police]]). In many countries, there is a common [[emergency service number]] that allows the police, firefighters, or medical services to be summoned to an emergency. Some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] have outlined command procedures, for the use in major emergencies or disorder. The [[Gold Silver Bronze command structure]] is a system set up to improve communications between ground-based officers and the control room, typically, Bronze Commander would be a senior officer on the ground, coordinating the efforts in the center of the emergency, Silver Commanders would be positioned in an 'Incident Control Room' erected to improve better communications at the scene, and a Gold Commander who would be in the Control Room.

Police are also responsible for reprimanding minor offenders by issuing [[summons|citations]] which typically may result in the imposition of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], particularly for violations of [[traffic]] law. Traffic enforcement is often and effectively accomplished by police officers on [[motorcycle]]s—called ''motor officers,'' these officers refer to the motorcycles they ride on duty as simply ''motors.'' Police are also trained to assist persons in distress, such as motorists whose car has broken down and people experiencing a medical emergency. Police are typically trained in basic [[first aid]] such as [[CPR]].

Some [[park ranger]]s are commissioned as law enforcement officers and carry out a law-enforcement role within [[national park]]s and other back-country wilderness and recreational areas, whereas [[Military police]] perform law enforcement functions within the military.

==Entry and promotion qualifications==
In most countries, candidates for the police force must have completed some formal education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://study.com/requirements_to_become_a_police_officer.html|title=Requirements to Become a Police Officer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing numbers of people are joining the police force who possess [[tertiary education]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://learn.org/articles/What_is_Tertiary_Education.html|title=What Is Tertiary Education?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in response to this many police forces have developed a "fast-track" scheme whereby those with [[university degree]]s spend two to three years as a [[Constable]] before receiving promotion to higher ranks, such as [[Sergeant]]s or [[Inspector]]s. (Officers who work within investigative divisions or plainclothes are not necessarily of a higher rank but merely have different duties.){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Police officers are also recruited from those with experience in the military or security services. In the United States [[U.S. state|state]] laws may [[Codification (law)|codify]] statewide qualification standards regarding age, education, criminal record, and training but in other places requirements are set by local police agencies. Each local Police agency has different requirements.
[[File:Pol mun agenti.jpg|thumb|Officers of the [[Municipal police (Italy)|Polizia Municipale]] from [[Piacenza]], [[Italy]]]]
Promotion is not automatic and usually requires the candidate to pass some kind of examination, interview board or other selection procedure. Although promotion normally includes an increase in [[salary]], it also brings with it an increase in responsibility and for most, an increase in administrative paperwork. There is no stigma attached to this, as experienced line patrol officers are highly regarded.

Dependent upon each agency, but generally after completing two years of service, officers may apply for specialist positions, such as [[detective]], [[police dog]] handler, [[mounted police]] officer, [[motorcycle]] officer, [[water police]] officer, or [[firearms officer]] (in countries where police are not routinely armed).

In some countries, including [[Singapore]], police ranks are supplemented through [[conscription]], similar to [[national service]] in the military. Qualifications may thus be relaxed or enhanced depending on the target mix of conscripts. Conscripts face tougher physical requirements in areas such as eyesight, but minimum academic qualification requirements are less stringent. Some join as volunteers, again via differing qualification requirements.

==Pay==
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
In some societies, police officers are paid relatively well compared to other occupations; their pay depends on what rank they are within their police force and how many years they have served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.police-information.co.uk/policepay.htm |title=Police Pay |publisher=Police-information.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United States, a police officer's salary averaged $61,230 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policetestguide.com/resources/police-officer-salary/ |title=Police Officer Salary – Police Test Guide &amp;#124; Police Officer Test |publisher=Police Test Guide |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United Kingdom for the year 2015–16 a police officer's average salary was £30,901.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Occupational safety and health ==
{{main article|Police officer safety and health}}There are numerous issues affecting the [[Occupational safety and health|safety and health]] of police officers, including line of duty deaths and [[occupational stress]].

== Application of force ==
===Individual cases===
{{main|Use of force}}
Almost universally, police officers are authorized the use of force, up to and including [[deadly force]], when acting in a law enforcement capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/police-weapons/comparative-summary.php|title=The Use-of-Force Continuum|date=9 June 2015|website=Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most [[law enforcement agencies]] follow some variant of the [[use of force continuum]], where officers are only authorized the level of force required to match situational requirements, specific thresholds and responses vary between [[jurisdictions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/Pages/continuum.aspx|title=The Use-of-Force Continuum|date=4 August 2009|website=National Institute of Justice|publisher=National Institute of Justice|access-date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While officers are trained to avoid excessive use of force, and may be held [[Criminal law|legally accountable]] for infractions, the variability of law enforcement and its dependence on [[Decision-making|human judgment]] have made the subject an area of [[Police brutality|controversy]] and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/fryer/publications/empirical-analysis-racial-differences-police-use-force|title=An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force|author=Fryer, Roland G. Jr.|date=July 2016|website=Harvard University|publisher=Harvard University|access-date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtamu.edu/webres/File/Academics/College%20of%20Education%20and%20Social%20Sciences/Department%20of%20Political%20Science%20and%20Criminal%20Justice/PBJ/2011/2n2_03Wittie.pdf|title=Police Use of Force|author=Wittie, Mark Curtis |date=2011|website=West Texas A&amp;M University|publisher=West Texas A&amp;M University|access-date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accountability===
{{main|Police accountability}}
In the performance of their duties, police officers may act unlawfully, either deliberately or as a result of errors in judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&amp;tid=84|title=Use of Force|date=19 May 2017|website=Bureau of Justice Statistics|publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics|access-date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police accountability efforts strive to protect citizens and their rights by ensuring legal and effective law enforcement conduct, while affording individual officers the required autonomy, protection, and [[discretion]]. As an example, the use of body-worn cameras has been shown to reduce both instances of misconduct and complaints against officers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=E.|year=2016|title=Lights, Camera, Redaction...

Following the swearing in of Saud ibn Abd al-Aziz as crown prince of [[Emirate of Diriyah|the Wahhabi]] in 1788, he moved to expand his empire eastward towards the Persian Gulf and Qatar. After defeating the Bani Khalid in 1795, the Wahhabi were attacked on two fronts. The Ottomans and [[Egypt]]ians assaulted the western front, while the Al Khalifa in Bahrain and the [[Oman]]is launched an attack against the eastern front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Casey|first=Michael S.|title=The History of Kuwait (The Greenwood Histories of the Modern Nations)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AwweY4yYSMIC|publisher=Greenwood|pages=37–38|year=2007|isbn=978-0313340734}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qdl1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023575945.0x0000c7|title='Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.

[[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman|Said bin Sultan]] of Muscat capitalised on this opportunity and raided the Wahhabi garrisons on the eastern coast, setting fire to the fort in Zubarah. The Al Khalifa were effectively returned to power thereafter.&lt;ref name="qdl1"/&gt;

As punishment for piracy, an [[East India Company]] vessel bombarded [[Doha]] in 1821, destroying the town and forcing hundreds of residents to flee. In 1825, the [[House of Thani]] was established with Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Thani]] as the first leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachmideast.org/geography/qatar |title=Qatar |publisher=Teachmideast.org |date= |accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Qatar had the legal status of a [[dependent territory|dependency]], there was a popular sentiment of resentment against the Al Khalifa. In 1867, the Al Khalifa, along with the ruler of [[Abu Dhabi]], sent a massive naval force to [[Al Wakrah]] in an effort to crush the Qatari rebels. This resulted in the maritime [[Qatari–Bahraini War]] of 1867–1868, in which Bahraini and Abu Dhabi forces sacked and looted Doha and Al Wakrah.&lt;ref name="Fromhertz2012"&gt;{{cite book |title = Katar'da Osmanlilar 1871–1916 |last1= Kursun|first1= Zekeriya|publisher=Turk Tarih Kurumu|year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bahraini hostilities were in violation of the [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820|1820 Anglo-Bahraini Treaty]]. The joint incursion, in addition to the Qatari counterattack, prompted British political agent [[Lewis Pelly]] to impose a settlement in 1868. His mission to Bahrain and Qatar and the resulting peace treaty were milestones because they implicitly recognised the distinctness of Qatar from Bahrain and explicitly acknowledged the position of Mohammed bin Thani. In addition to censuring Bahrain for its breach of agreement, the British [[protectorate]] asked to negotiate with a representative from Qatar, a role which Mohammed bin Thani was selected to fulfil. The results of the negotiations left the nation with a new-found sense of political identity, although it did not gain an official standing as a protectorate until 1916.

===Ottoman rule (1871–1915)===

Under military and political pressure from the governor of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Vilayet of Baghdad]], [[Midhat Pasha]], the ruling [[House of Thani|Al Thani]] tribe submitted to Ottoman rule in 1871.&lt;ref name="Rogan1199"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Rogan|first1 = Eugene|date = November 1999|title = Review of The Ottoman Gulf: The Creation of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Qatar by Frederick F.

However, Qatari-Ottoman relations soon stagnated, and in 1882 they suffered further setbacks when the Ottomans refused to aid Al Thani in his expedition of [[Abu Dhabi]]-occupied [[Khawr al Udayd]]. In addition, the Ottomans supported the Ottoman subject Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab who attempted to supplant Al Thani as [[kaymakam]] of Qatar in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Habibur Rahman, pgs.143–144&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led Al Thani to rebel against the Ottomans, whom he believed were seeking to usurp control of the peninsula. He resigned as kaymakam and stopped paying taxes in August 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Habibur Rahman, pgs.150–151&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1893, Mehmed Hafiz Pasha arrived in Qatar in the interests of seeking unpaid taxes and accosting Jassim bin Mohammed's opposition to proposed Ottoman administrative reforms. Fearing that he would face death or imprisonment, Jassim retreated to Al Wajbah (10&amp;nbsp;miles west of [[Doha]]), accompanied by several tribe members. Mehmed's demand that Jassim disband his troops and pledge his loyalty to the Ottomans was met with refusal. In March, Mehmed imprisoned Jassim's brother and 13 prominent Qatari tribal leaders on the Ottoman [[corvette]] ''Merrikh'' as punishment for his insubordination. After Mehmed declined an offer to release the captives for a fee of 10,000 [[Turkish lira|liras]], he ordered a column of approximately 200 troops to advance towards Jassim's [[Al Wajbah Fort]] under the command of Yusuf Effendi, thus signalling the start of the [[Battle of Al Wajbah]].&lt;ref name="fromherz"/&gt;

Effendi's troops came under heavy gunfire by a sizable troop of Qatari infantry and cavalry shortly after arriving to Al Wajbah. They retreated to Shebaka fortress, where they were again forced to draw back from a Qatari incursion. After they withdrew to Al Bidda fortress, Jassim's advancing column besieged the fortress, resulting in the Ottomans' concession of defeat and agreement to relinquish their captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed Pasha's cavalry to [[Hofuf]] by land.&lt;ref&gt;Habibur Rahman, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Although Qatar did not gain full independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]], the result of the battle forced a treaty that would later form the basis of Qatar's emerging as an autonomous country within the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qatarvisitor.com/index.php?cID=439&amp;pID=1701 |title=Battle of Al Wajbah |publisher=Qatar Visitor |date=2 June 2007 |accessdate=22 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117024415/http://www.qatarvisitor.com/index.php?cID=439&amp;pID=1701 |archivedate=17 January 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British rule (1916–1971)===
[[File:Al Zubarah (6989829695).jpg|thumb|left|[[Zubarah Fort]] built in 1938.]]
The Ottoman Empire fell into disorder after losing battles in different fronts in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I]]. Qatar took part in the [[Arab revolt]] against the Ottomans. The revolt was successful and Ottoman rule in the country further declined. The United Kingdom and the Ottoman Empire accorded their recognition to Sheikh [[Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani]] and his successors' right to rule over the whole of the Qatari Peninsula. The Ottomans renounced all their rights to Qatar and, following the outbreak of the [[First World War]], Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani (who was pro-British) forced them to abandon [[Doha]] in 1915.&lt;ref name=diwan&gt;{{cite web|title=Amiri Diwan – Shaikh Abdullah Bin Jassim Al Thani |url=http://www.diwan.gov.qa/english/Qatar/AbdullahBinQassim.htm |publisher=Diwan.gov.qa |accessdate=28 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210053313/http://www.diwan.gov.qa/english/qatar/AbdullahBinQassim.htm |archivedate=10 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]], Qatar became a British protectorate on 3 November 1916. On that day, the United Kingdom signed a treaty with Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani to bring Qatar under its [[Trucial States|Trucial System of Administration]]. While Abdullah agreed not to enter into any relations with any other power without prior consent of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]], the British guaranteed the protection of Qatar from all aggression by sea.&lt;ref name="diwan"/&gt; On 5 May 1935, Abdullah signed another treaty with the British government which granted Qatar protection against internal and external threats.&lt;ref name="diwan"/&gt; Oil reserves were first discovered in 1939. However, exploitation was delayed by [[World War II]].

The influence of the [[British Empire]] started diminishing after World War&amp;nbsp;II, particularly following the independence of India and creation of Pakistan in 1947. Oil exports began in 1949, and oil revenues became the country's main source of revenue, the pearl trade having gone into decline. These revenues were used to fund the expansion and modernisation of Qatar's infrastructure. When Britain officially announced in 1968 that it would politically disengage from the Persian Gulf in three years' time, Qatar joined talks with Bahrain and seven other [[Trucial States]] to create a federation. Regional disputes, however, persuaded Qatar and Bahrain to withdraw from the talks and become independent states separately from the Trucial States, which went on to become the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Qatar Profile - Timeline |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qatar&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 1916, the sheikh of Qatar entered into treaty relations with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zahlan |first1=Rosemarie |title=The Creation of Qatar |date=1979 |publisher=Croom Helm |location=Abingdon |isbn=9761315641904 |page=144 |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty reserved foreign affairs and defence to the United Kingdom but allowed internal autonomy. On 3 September 1971, those "special treaty arrangements" that were "inconsistent with full international responsibility as a sovereign and independent state" were terminated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Exchange of Notes constituting an Agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Kuwait regarding relations between the United ...

In 1991, Qatar played a significant role in the [[Gulf War]], particularly during the [[Battle of Khafji]] in which Qatari tanks rolled through the streets of the town and provided fire support for [[Saudi Arabian National Guard]] units that were engaging [[Iraqi Army]] troops. Qatar allowed coalition troops from Canada to use the country as an [[Canada Dry One|airbase]] to launch aircraft on [[Combat Air Patrol|CAP]] duty and also permitted air forces from the United States and France to operate in its territories.&lt;ref name="cs1"/&gt;

In 1995, Emir [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]] seized control of the country from his father [[Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani]], with the support of the armed forces and cabinet, as well as neighbouring states&lt;ref name=resh&gt;{{cite news|title=New Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim 'set to announce reshuffle'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23059333|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 June 2013|date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jacques Chirac|France]].&lt;ref name=nobs&gt;[http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/l-enquete-de-l-obs/20130405.OBS6953/qatar-s-ils-pouvaient-ils-acheteraient-la-tour-eiffel.html nouvelobs.com: "Qatar : "S'ils pouvaient, ils achèteraient la Tour Eiffel"], 7 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Under Emir Hamad, Qatar has experienced a moderate degree of [[liberalisation]], including the launch of the [[Al Jazeera]] television station (1996), the endorsement of [[women's suffrage]] or right to vote in municipal elections (1999), drafting its first written [[Constitution of Qatar|constitution]] (2005) and inauguration of a Roman Catholic church (2008).

[[Ahmed Rashid]], writing in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', stated that through the office Qatar has "facilitated meetings between the Taliban and many countries and organisations, including the US state department, the UN, Japan, several European governments and non-governmental organisations, all of whom have been trying to push forward the idea of peace talks.

The increased influence of Qatar and its role during the Arab Spring, especially during the [[Bahraini protests of 2011–2014|Bahraini uprising in 2011]], [[Qatar–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict|worsened longstanding tensions with Saudi Arabia]], the neighboring [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE), and Bahrain.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} In June 2017, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain [[2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis|cut off diplomatic relations]] with Qatar, citing [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|the country's alleged support of groups they considered to be extremist]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia and Bahrain break diplomatic ties with Qatar over 'terrorism'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/05/saudi-arabia-and-bahrain-break-diplomatic-ties-with-qatar-over-terrorism|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in increased Qatari economic and military ties with Turkey and Iran.

[[Polygyny in Islam|Islamic polygyny]] is permitted.&lt;ref name=nobs/&gt;

[[Judicial corporal punishment]] is common in Qatar due to the [[Wahhabi]] interpretation of Sharia Law, although in Qatar it had originally been a [[Hanbali]] school of mainstream [[Sunnism]]. [[Flogging]] is employed as a punishment for alcohol consumption or illicit sexual relations.&lt;ref name="amne" /&gt; Article 88 of Qatar's criminal code declares that the penalty for adultery is [[flagellation|100 lashes]],&lt;ref name="flog" /&gt; and in 2006, a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] woman received that punishment.&lt;ref name="flog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Filipino woman gets 100 lashes for giving birth in Qatar|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/9758/news/nation/filipino-woman-gets-100-lashes-for-giving-birth-in-qatar}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, at least 18 people (mostly foreign nationals) were sentenced to receive between 40 and 100 lashes for offences involving "illicit sexual relations" or alcohol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qatar|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/qatar/report-2010|publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, at least 21 people (mostly foreign nationals) were sentenced to between 30 and 100 lashes for the same reasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qatar|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/qatar/report-2011#section-117-9|publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012, six expatriates were sentenced to either 40 or 100 lashes.&lt;ref name="amne"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amnesty International Annual Report 2012 – Qatar|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/qatar/report-2012#section-27-6|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only Muslims considered medically fit are liable to have such sentences carried out.

===Human rights===
{{Main|Human rights in Qatar}}

According to the [[U.S. State Department]], expatriate workers from nations throughout [[Asia]] and parts of [[Africa]] voluntarily migrate to Qatar as low-skilled labourers or domestic servants, but some subsequently face conditions indicative of involuntary servitude. Some of the more common labour rights violations include beatings, withholding of payment, charging workers for benefits for which the employer is responsible, restrictions on freedom of movement (such as the confiscation of passports, travel documents, or exit permits), arbitrary detention, threats of legal action, and sexual assault.&lt;ref name="2011narrq"&gt;{{cite book |title = Human Trafficking Report 2011|accessdate = 21 January 2012|date = June 2011|chapter = Country Narratives|publisher = Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, [[United States Department of State]]|url = https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2011/164233.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many migrant workers arriving for work in Qatar have paid exorbitant fees to recruiters in their home countries.&lt;ref name="2011narrq"/&gt;

{{As of|2014}}, certain provisions of the Qatari Criminal Code allows punishments such as [[flogging]] and [[stoning]] to be imposed as criminal sanctions. The [[UN Committee Against Torture]] found that these practices constituted a breach of the obligations imposed by the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|UN Convention Against Torture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kelly|first1= Tobias|year= 2009|title= The UN Committee against Torture: Human Rights Monitoring and the Legal Recognition of Cruelty |journal= Human Rights Quarterly|volume=313 |issue= 3|pages= 777–800 |doi= 10.1353/hrq.0.0094}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report  | date = 25 July 2006 | title = Conclusions and Recommendations: Qatar | url = http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?docid=453776c75 | publisher = UN Committee Against Torture | docket = U.N.

(Par. 12)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qatar retains the death penalty, mainly for threats against national security such as terrorism. Use of the death penalty is rare and no state executions have taken place in Qatar since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handsoffcain.info/bancadati/schedastato.php?idstato=18000093&amp;idcontinente=23 |title= Death penalties in the world -Qatar |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Qatar, [[LGBT rights in Qatar|homosexual acts]] are illegal and can be punished by death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/gay-lesbian-bisexual-relationships-illegal-in-74-countries-a7033666.html |title= LGBT relationships are illegal in 74 countries, research finds | work = The Independent| date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the provisions of Qatar's sponsorship law, sponsors have the unilateral power to cancel workers' residency permits, deny workers' ability to change employers, report a worker as "absconded" to police authorities, and deny permission to leave the country.&lt;ref name="2011narrq"/&gt; As a result, sponsors may restrict workers' movements and workers may be afraid to report abuses or claim their rights.&lt;ref name="2011narrq" /&gt; According to the [[ITUC]], the visa sponsorship system allows the exaction of [[forced labour]] by making it difficult for a migrant worker to leave an abusive employer or travel overseas without permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International unions warn Qatar's work visa system allows employers to use forced labour|url=http://www.ituc-csi.org/international-unions-warn-qatar-s?lang=en|publisher=ITUC-CSI-IGB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qatar also does not maintain wage standards for its [[immigrant]] labourers. Qatar commissioned international law firm [[DLA Piper]] to produce a report investigating the immigrant labour system. In May 2014 DLA Piper released over 60 recommendations for reforming the kafala system including the abolition of exit visas and the introduction of a minimum wage which Qatar has pledged to implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/14/qatar-admits-deaths-in-migrant-workers |title=Qatar government admits almost 1,000 fatalities among migrants |author=Owen Gibson |date=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One has been to maximize Qatar's influence on the regional and international stage. This originally reflected the personal ambition of the former ruler and current emir's father, Shaykh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani, and his foreign minister and eventual prime minister, Shaykh Hamad bin Jassim al Thani. The two men directed foreign policy until the father abdicated in favor of his son, Emir Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, in July 2013.  The second objective has been to preserve the security of the ruling family and state.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of Qatar's alliances provides insight into the basis of their policy.

Qatar has mixed relations with its neighbours in the Persian Gulf region.

In 2014, Qatar's relations with [[Bahrain]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] came to a boiling point over Qatar's support for the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]&lt;ref name=resh /&gt; and reportedly funding extremist groups in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirkpatrick|first1=David D.|title=Qatar's Support of Islamists Alienates Allies Near and Far|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/world/middleeast/qatars-support-of-extremists-alienates-allies-near-and-far.html?_r=0|accessdate=5 June 2015|work=The New York Times|date=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Qatar has been using Islamist militants in a number of countries including Egypt, Syria, Libya, Somalia and Mali to further its foreign policy. Courting Islamists from the Muslim Brotherhood to [[Salafi movement|Salafist]] groups has served as a power amplifier for the country, as it believes since the beginning of the [[Arab Spring]] that these groups represented the wave of the future.&lt;ref name=nyt20130630&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|author1=Mark Mazzetti |author2=C.J.

Qatar has hosted academic, religious, political, and economic conferences. The 11th annual Doha Forum recently brought in key thinkers, professionals of various backgrounds, and political figures from all over the world to discuss democracy, media and information technology, free trade, and [[water security]] issues.

Notable among these include the Darfur Agreement. The Doha Declaration is the basis of the peace process in Darfur and it has achieved significant gains on the ground for the African region.

The Qatar Armed Forces are the military forces of Qatar. The country maintains a modest military force of approximately 11,800 men, including an army (8,500), navy (1,800) and air force (1,500). Qatar's defense expenditures accounted for approximately 4.2% of gross national product in 1993, and 1.5% of gross domestic product in 2010, the most recent year available in the SIPRI statistical database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/Milex-share-of-GDP.pdf|title=Military expenditure by country as percentage of gross domestic product, 2003–2016|work=SIPRI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qatar has recently signed defense pacts with the United States and United Kingdom, as well as with France earlier in 1994. Qatar plays an active role in the collective defense efforts of the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Cooperation Council]]; the other five members are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the UAE, and Oman. The presence of the large [[Al Udeid Air Base]], operated by the United States and several other UN nations, provides a guaranteed source of defense and national security. In 2008 Qatar spent US$2.3 billion on military expenditures, 2.3% of the gross domestic product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://milexdata.sipri.org |title=The SIPRI Military Expenditure Database |publisher=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute |accessdate=29 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328072123/http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |archivedate=28 March 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Qatari special forces have been trained by [[France]] and other Western countries, and are believed to possess considerable skill.&lt;ref name=strangepow&gt;{{cite web|title=The Strange Power of Qatar by Hugh Eakin|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/oct/27/strange-power-qatar/?pagination=false|publisher=The New York Review of Books|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also helped the Libyan rebels during the [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|2011 Battle of Tripoli]].&lt;ref name=strangepow/&gt;

The [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] (SIPRI) found that in 2010–14 Qatar was the 46th-largest arms importer in the world. However, SIPRI writes, Qatar's plans to transform and significantly enlarge its armed forces have accelerated. Orders in 2013 for 62 tanks and 24 self-propelled guns from Germany were followed in 2014 by a number of other contracts, including 24 combat helicopters and 3 [[Airborne early warning and control|early-warning-and-control]] aircraft from the US, and 2 tanker aircraft from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trends in International Arms Transfer, 2014|url=http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=495|website=www.sipri.org|publisher=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|accessdate=18 March 2015|ref=SIPRI Fact Sheet, March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319023856/http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=495|archivedate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Qatar was the 16th largest arms importer in the world, and in 2016, it was the 11th largest, according to SIPRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/toplist.php|title=TIV of arms imports to the top 50 largest importers, 2016-2016|work=SIPRI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qatari [[peninsula]] protrudes {{convert|100|mi|km|sigfig=2|order=flip}} into the Persian Gulf, north of Saudi Arabia. It lies between latitudes [[24th parallel north|24°]] and [[27th parallel north|27° N]], and longitudes [[50th meridian east|50°]] and [[52nd meridian east|52° E]]. Most of the country consists of a low, barren [[plain]], covered with [[sand]]. To the southeast lies the [[Khor al&amp;nbsp;Adaid]] ("[[Inland sea (geology)|Inland Sea]]"), an area of rolling sand dunes surrounding an [[inlet]] of the Persian Gulf. There are mild winters and very hot, humid summers.

The highest point in Qatar is Qurayn Abu al Bawl at {{convert|103|m|ft}}&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{cite web | title=Qatar | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/qa.html | publisher = [[Central Intelligence Agency]] | work =[[CIA World Factbook]] | date = 8 February 2012 | accessdate =4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Jebel Dukhan to the west, a range of low [[limestone]] [[outcrop]]pings running north-south from Zikrit through [[Umm Bab]] to the southern border. The Jebel Dukhan area also contains Qatar's main onshore [[oil field|oil deposits]], while the [[natural gas field]]s lie offshore, to the northwest of the peninsula.

Before the discovery of oil, the economy of the Qatari region focused on fishing and [[pearl hunting]]. A report prepared by local governors of Ottoman Empire in 1892 states that total income from pearl hunting in 1892 is 2,450,000 kran.&lt;ref name="Fromhertz2012" /&gt; After the introduction of the Japanese [[cultured pearl]] onto the world market in the 1920s and 1930s, Qatar's pearling industry crashed.

In 2012, Qatar retained its title of richest country in the world (according to per capita income) for the third time in a row, having first overtaken [[Luxembourg]] in 2010. According to the study published by the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-based Institute of International Finance, Qatar's per capita GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) was $106,000 (QR387,000) in 2012, helping the country retain its ranking as the world's wealthiest nation. Luxembourg came a distant second with nearly $80,000 and Singapore third with per capita income of about $61,000. The research put Qatar's GDP at $182bn in 2012 and said it had climbed to an all-time high due to soaring gas exports and high oil prices. Its population stood at 1.8 million in 2012. The same study published that Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), with assets of $115bn, was ranked 12th among the richest sovereign wealth funds in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethgreenfield/2012/02/22/the-worlds-richest-countries/ |title=The World's Richest Countries |work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has no taxes, but authorities have announced plans to levy taxes on junk food and luxury items. The taxes would be implemented on goods that harm the human body – for example fast food, tobacco products, and soft drinks. The rollout of these initial taxes is believed to be due to the fall in oil prices and a deficit that the country faced in 2016. Additionally, the country has seen job cuts in 2016 from its petroleum companies and other sectors in the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dohanews.co/taxes-on-junk-food-luxury-items-to-be-rolled-out-in-qatar-soon/|title=Taxes on junk food, luxury items to be rolled out in Qatar soon|date=16 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dohanews.co/tag/layoffs/|title=layoffs Archives – Doha News|website=Doha News|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2012}}, Qatar has proven oil reserves of 15 billion barrels and gas fields that account for more than 13% of the global resource. As a result, it is the richest state per-capita in the world. None of its 2 million residents live below the poverty line and less than 1% are unemployed.&lt;ref name="bdlive.co.za"&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon Lincoln Reader |url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/columnists/2013/11/12/qatar-shows-how-money-can-solve-most-problems |title=Qatar shows how money can solve most problems |publisher=Bdlive.co.za |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qatar's economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC quotas on crude oil production, the [[1980s oil glut|lower price for oil]], and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from [[Egypt]] and South Asia, have grown again.

Oil production will not remain at the peak level of 500,000 barrels (80,000 m³) per day for long as the national oil fields are projected to be largely depleted by 2023. However, large natural gas reserves have been located off Qatar's northeast coast. Qatar's proved reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding 250 trillion cubic feet (7,000&amp;nbsp;km³). The economy was boosted in 1991 by completion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In 1996, the Qatargas project began exporting [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) to Japan. Further phases of North Field gas development costing billions of dollars are in various stages of planning and development.

Qatar's heavy industrial projects, all based in [[Umm Said]], include a refinery with a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m³) per day capacity, a fertiliser plant for urea and ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms and the state-owned [[Qatar Petroleum|Qatar General Petroleum Corporation]] (QGPC). The US is the major equipment supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and US companies are playing a major role in North Field gas development.&lt;ref name="bdlive.co.za" /&gt;

Qatar's [[Qatar National Vision 2030|National Vision 2030]] has made investment in renewable resources a major goal for the country over the next two decades.&lt;ref name="Qatar National Vision 2030" /&gt; Qatar pursues a vigorous programme of "[[Qatarization|Qatarisation]]", under which all joint venture industries and government departments strive to move Qatari nationals into positions of greater authority. Growing numbers of foreign-educated Qataris, including many educated in the US, are returning home to assume key positions formerly occupied by expatriates. To control the influx of expatriate workers, Qatar has tightened the administration of its foreign manpower programmes over the past several years. Security is the principal basis for Qatar's strict entry and immigration rules and regulations.&lt;ref name="bdlive.co.za" /&gt;

===Transport===
{{Main article|Transport in Qatar}}
[[File:Hamad International Airport Doha Qatar 6.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hamad International Airport]]]]
With a fast-expanding population and substantial economic growth over the past decade, a reliable and extensive transportation network is becoming increasingly necessary within Qatar. So far the government, the primary transport developer, has done well in terms of keeping up with demand for new transportation options. In 2008 the [[Ashghal|Public Works Authority]] (Ashghal), one of the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near future. Ashghal works in tandem with the Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA), the body that designed the transportation master plan, instituted in March 2006 and running to 2025.

As driving is the primary mode of transport in Qatar, the road network is a major focus of the plan. Project highlights in this segment include the multibillion-dollar Doha Expressway and the [[Qatar Bahrain Causeway]], which will connect Qatar to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and is considered a milestone in regional interconnectivity. 

Mass-transit options, such as a [[Doha metro]], light-rail system and more extensive bus networks, are also under development to ease road congestion. In addition, the railway system is being significantly expanded and could eventually form an integral part of a GCC-wide network linking all the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The airport, too, is expanding capacity to keep up with rising visitor numbers.

[[Hamad International Airport]] is the [[international airport]] of [[Doha]]. In 2014 replaced the former [[Doha International Airport]] as Qatar's principal airport. In 2016, the airport was named the [[List of busiest airports by passenger traffic|50th busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic]], serving 37,283,987 passengers, a 20.2% increase from 2015.

[[Hamad Port]] is Qatar's main seaport, located south of [[Doha]] in the Umm Al-Houl area. Construction of the port began in 2010; it became operational in December 2016.&lt;ref name="dn1"/&gt; It was officially opened in September 2017, and is expected to become fully operational by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/news/2017/09/qatar-emir-officially-inaugurates-hamad-port-170905110351179.html|title=Qatar's emir officially inaugurates Hamad Port|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=5 September 2017|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capable of handling up to 7.8 million tonnes of products annually, the bulk of trade which passes through the port consists of food and building materials.&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-gulf-qatar-port-idUKKBN19624H|title=Gulf crisis a "blessing in disguise" for Qatar seaport|author=John Davison|publisher=Reuters|date=15 June 2017|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the northern coast, [[Ras Laffan Industrial City#Port of Ras Laffan|Ras Laffan Port]] serves as the most extensive LNG exporting facility in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/analysis/sea-change-state%E2%80%99s-port-facilities-capacity-and-transport-links-are-being-strengthened|title=Qatar strengthens port facilities, capacity and transport links|publisher=Oxford Business Group|year=2016|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Qatar}}
{{wide image|The Doha city skyline, featuring post-modern structures, view from Al Corniche.jpg|1000px|Skyline of [[Doha]]}}
The number of people in Qatar fluctuates considerably depending on the season, since the country relies heavily on migrant labour. In early 2017, Qatar's total population was 2.6 million, with non-Arab foreigners making up a vast majority of Qatar's population. Only 313,000 of the population (12%) were Qatari citizens, while the remaining 2.3 million (88%) were [[expatriates]].&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;

The combined number of [[South Asia]]ns (from the countries of the [[Indian subcontinent]] including Sri Lanka) by themselves represent over 1.5 million people (60%) of Qatar’s population. Among these, [[Indians in Qatar|Indians]] are the largest community, numbering 650,000 in 2017,&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt; followed by 350,000 [[Nepalis in Qatar|Nepalis]], 280,000 [[Bangladeshis]], 145,000 [[Sri Lankans]], and 125,000 [[Pakistanis in Qatar|Pakistanis]]. The contingent of expatriates which are not of South Asian origin represent around 28% of Qatar’s population, of which the largest group is 260,000 [[Filipinos in Qatar|Filipinos]] and 200,000 [[Egyptians]], plus many other nationalities (including nationals of other Arab countries, Europeans, etc.).&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;

===Literature===
{{Main|Qatari literature}}
[[File:Qatar National Library 2.jpg|thumb|[[Qatar National Library]] in Doha]]
Qatari literature traces its origins back to the 19th century. Originally, written [[poetry]] was the most common form of expression. Abdul Jalil Al-Tabatabai and Mohammed bin Abdullah bin Uthaymeen, two poets dating back to the early 19th century, formed the corpus of Qatar's earliest written poetry. Poetry later fell out of favor after Qatar began reaping the profits from oil exports in the mid-20th century and many Qataris abandoned their [[Bedouin]] traditions in favor of more urban lifestyles.&lt;ref name="tawfiq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aljasra.org/archive/cms/?p=2727|title=الشعر في قطر علي امتداد مائة سنة|publisher=Al Jasra Cultural and Social Club|author=Hassan Tawfiq|language=Arabic|date=1 May 2015|accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the increasing number of Qataris who began receiving formal education during the 1950s and other significant societal changes, 1970 witnessed the introduction of the first [[short story]] anthology, and in 1993 the first locally authored [[novel]]s were published. Poetry, particularly the predominant [[nabati]] form, retained some importance but would soon be overshadowed by other literary types.&lt;ref name="tawfiq"/&gt; Unlike most other forms of art in Qatari society, females have been involved in the modern literature movement on a similar magnititude to males.&lt;ref name="cambridge1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pk5TA0sfERIC&amp;pg=PA448|title=Modern Arabic Literature|authors=Muḥammad Muṣṭafá Badawī, Muhammad Mustafa Badawi, M.

Al Jazeera initially launched in 1996 as an [[Arabic]] news and current affairs [[satellite]] TV channel of the same name, but has since expanded into a global network of several speciality TV&amp;nbsp;channels known collectively as the [[Al Jazeera Media Network]].

It has been reported that journalists practice [[self-censorship]], particularly in regards to the government and [[House of Thani|ruling family]] of Qatar.&lt;ref name="blanchard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blanchard|first=Christoper|title=Qatar: Background and U.S. Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7GCvg2eCx4C|publisher=Congressional Research Service|year=2014|page=17|isbn=9781437987089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of the government, Emir and ruling family in the media is illegal.

In 2014, a [[Computer crime|Cybercrime]] Prevention Law was passed. The law is said to restrict press freedom, and carries prison sentences and fines for broad reasons such as jeopardising local peace or publishing false news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpj.org/2014/09/new-cybercrime-law-could-have-serious-consequences.php|title=New cybercrime law could have serious consequences for press freedom in Qatar|publisher=cpj.org|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gulf Center for Human Rights has stated that the law is a threat to freedom of speech and has called for certain articles of the law to be revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gc4hr.org/news/view/747|title=Qatar: New Cyber Crime Law poses real threat to Freedom of Expression|publisher=gc4hr.org|date=17 September 2014|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Press media has undergone expansion in recent years.

In regards to telecommunication infrastructure, Qatar is the highest ranked Middle Eastern country in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI) – an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. Qatar ranked number 23 overall in the 2014 NRI ranking, unchanged from 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GITR/2014/GITR_OverallRanking_2014.pdf |title=NRI Overall Ranking 2014 |publisher=World Economic Forum |accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qatar's winning bid for the 2022 World Cup was greeted enthusiastically in the Persian Gulf region as it was the first time a country in the Middle East had been selected to host the tournament. However, the bid has been embroiled in much controversy, including allegations of bribery and interference in the investigation of the alleged bribery. European football associations have also objected to the 2022 World Cup being held in Qatar for a variety of reasons, from the impact of warm temperatures on players' fitness, to the disruption it might cause in European domestic league calendars should the event be rescheduled to take place during winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.qatarchronicle.com/sports/35752/europes-top-leagues-protest-against-2022-winter-world-cup-in-qatar/ |title= Europe's Top Leagues protest against 2022 winter World Cup in Qatar |work= Qatar Chronicle |date= 12 August 2013 |accessdate= 21 August 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130817110819/http://www.qatarchronicle.com/sports/35752/europes-top-leagues-protest-against-2022-winter-world-cup-in-qatar/ |archive-date= 17 August 2013 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.qatarchronicle.com/sports/34172/fifa-wants-qatar-2022-postponed-to-winter/|title = Fifa wants Qatar 2022 postponed to Winter|publisher = Qatar Chronicle|date = 20 July 2013|accessdate = 21 August 2013|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141110211907/http://www.qatarchronicle.com/sports/34172/fifa-wants-qatar-2022-postponed-to-winter/|archive-date = 10 November 2014|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, Qatari football official [[Mohammed bin Hammam]] was accused of making payments totalling £3m to officials in return for their support for the Qatar bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27652181 |title=BBC Sport – Qatar World Cup: '£3m payments to officials' corruption claim |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a FIFA inquiry into the bidding process in November 2014 cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30031405|title=World Cup inquiry clears Qatar but criticises English FA|publisher=BBC|date=13 November 2014|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The roots of the organization go back to 1923 when it was founded as the Rabbinical Council of the [[Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America]]. Its purpose was to perpetuate and promote Orthodox [[Judaism]] in the [[United States of America]].

Its members attempted on a number of occasions to merge with other Jewish groups, for the purpose of developing a unified traditional rabbinate for the [[American Jewish community]]. A number of attempts were made to join with groups such as [[Agudat Israel]], but all such attempts were rebuffed.

A merger took place in 1935 between the [[Rabbinical Council of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations]] and another Orthodox rabbinical group, the Rabbinical Association of the [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]], a part of [[Yeshiva University]]. With this merger the combined group took the name '''Rabbinical Council of America''', known in the Jewish community as the '''RCA'''. In 1942 the [[Hebrew Theological College]] Alumni merged with the RCA. In later years the RCA attempted to merge with another Orthodox rabbinical group, the [[Rabbinical Alliance of America]], but this attempt failed. There was also a temporary adoption of the [[Orthodox Roundtable]] that was abandoned in 1991, RCA leadership tried to censor the group.

Most members of the Rabbinical Council of America are actively working as pulpit rabbis; a significant minority are working in [[Jewish education]].

Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]] played an important role in the RCA until his death in 1993.
For many years, the RCA was led by Rabbi Steven Dworkin, who served as executive vice-president until his death in January 2003.  The RCA was then headed by Rabbi Basil Herring, who previously served as director of the Orthodox Forum. In September 2012 the RCA announced that Rabbi Herring was transitioning to the position of [[editor-in-chief]] of RCA Publications and that Rabbi [[Mark Dratch]] would take over as the new EVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faithtrustinstitute.org/news/rabbi_dratch_appointment|title=RCA Appoints Rabbi Mark Dratch as its New Executive Vice President|publisher=Faithrustinstitute.org|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, complaints have surfaced within the Orthodox Jewish community about a lack of leadership and direction by the RCA and that the RCA has failed to meet the challenges posed by recent changes within the Orthodox Jewish community.

It publishes an English quarterly [[Academic journal|journal]], ''[[Tradition (journal)|Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought]]'', which began in 1958, and a Hebrew journal, ''HaDarom'', which began in 1957.

The RCA was, for many years, affiliated with two [[yeshiva]]s in [[Israel]] – Yeshivat HaDarom and the ''[[Gan Yavne]]h Youth Village. It severed its relations with both in 2009, pleading economic difficulties.

In 2009, it issued a protest against a [[USCCB]] statement on interfaith dialogue that was critical of [[dual-covenant theology]].

As of 2010, there were close to 1,000 ordained rabbis in the RCA, spread throughout 14 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbis.org/about_us.cfm|title=Rabbinical Council of America (RCA) - About Us|publisher=Rabbis.org|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geirus Policies and Standards committee==

The move was controversial, with some criticism that it would make conversion more difficult and intimidating, create onerous burdens for adopted children scheduled for conversion, and represented a capitulation to more conservative voices.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pruzansky /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowenfeld /&gt; Supporters of the GPS maintain that it would establish certainty for converts—particularly those looking to move to Israel and have their conversion recognized, create definite benchmarks, ensure observance of Jewish law by converts, and squelch past practices of questionable conversions that stemmed from situational pressure on individual rabbis.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pruzansky /&gt;

Under the process created by the GPS, while individual rabbis mentor and educate potential converts, as was the case previously, a regional religious court ([[beth din]]) finalizes the conversion by examining the prospective convert and deciding whether to approving the application.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pruzansky /&gt;

A week after the arrest of Rabbi [[Barry Freundel]], a prominent [[Washington, D.C.]] area RCA member on charges of [[voyeurism]] at a ''[[mikvah]]'', the RCA sought to contain damage from negative publicity. It announced on October 20, 2014 that it would now require the appointment of ombudswomen to protect the interests and handle concerns of women undergoing conversion to Judaism, a process which requires disrobing in a ritual bath. The council announced it would also create a commission to identify ways that abuses of converts during the conversion process could be prevented. The council noted that the commission will include female members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/us/rabbinical-council-to-add-a-role-for-women-in-wake-of-voyeurism-scandal.html|title=Rabbinical Council To Add A Role For Women In Wake Of Voyeurism Scandal|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crimes allegedly committed by Freundel sent shock waves through the American Jewish community and threatened to precipitate a crisis between the American and Israeli rabbinates. Initially, the spokesperson for the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], Ziv Maor, indicated that conversions Freundel had supervised would be reviewed, but after an emergency meeting the Rabbinate issued a statement that Freundel's conversions before his arrest would be viewed as valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/22/barry-freundel-conversions_n_6023906.html|title=Conversions Performed By Barry Freundel, Rabbi Arrested For Voyeurism, Still Legitimate: Israel Rabbinate|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014 the RCA was added as a defendant in a lawsuit prompted by Freundel's alleged voyeurism. The lawsuit was filed by a student at [[Georgetown University]]'s law school who initially identified [[Kesher Israel (Washington, D.C.)|Kesher Israel Congregation]], the synagogue where Freundel served as rabbi, the ''mikvah'', and the law school as defendants for permitting Freundel’s alleged illegal activities to go unchecked.&lt;ref&gt;"JTA 'Freundel-related lawsuit adds RCA as defendant' (19 Dec 2014)"http://www.timesofisrael.com/freundel-related-lawsuit-adds-rca-as-defendant/&lt;/ref&gt; Two more lawsuits were filed by the end of 2014, alleging RCA was aware of irregular behavior on Freundel's part but failed to remove him from positions of authority. Rabbi [[Marc D. Angel]], a critic of the RCA's new conversion system, claimed that if the allegations are true, they reinforce concerns about the concentration of conversion powers. "This is a bad example of the fears we have had all along," Angel told ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]''. "If you concentrate too much power in few hands, then there is bound to be abuse, and this just confirms our deepest fears." In response to the lawsuits, RCA issued the following statement: "The RCA has conducted itself appropriately and is taking important steps to improve its conversion protocols. We will defend ourselves vigorously in this matter."&lt;ref name=carwash&gt;{{cite news|last=Nathan-Kazis|first=Josh|title=Did Rabbi Barry Freundel Treat Mikveh Like 'Car Wash' To Peep on Women?

On October 22, 2018, a $14.25 million class action settlement was reached over claims connected to Freundel.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chaikinandsherman.com/freundel-class-action-settlement/&lt;/ref&gt; The RCA, along with Kesher Israel, the National Capital Mikvah, and the Beth Din of America, were named as settling defendants.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chaikinandsherman.com/documents/FINAL_MikvahSettlement_Long-Form-Notice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Following the release of a resolution on gun usage and [[gun ownership]] in July 2014, a controversy arose where a group of 12 Orthodox rabbis—nine of them members of the RCA—issued a counterstatement disputing the resolution.&lt;ref name=wapo20140916&gt;
{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/09/16/orthodox-rabbis-on-guns/ |title=Orthodox rabbis on guns |accessdate=2014-11-15 |work=Washington Post |date=2014-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequent dialogue focused on the alleged narrowness or breadth of the RCA statement in condemning "gun violence" and the "critique of elements of American culture that valorize weaponry and violence” that focus exclusively on [[Gun politics in the United States|guns]] rather than non-firearm related violence in the United States,&lt;ref name=grpc20141006&gt;
{{cite web |title=Reply by the Golani Rifle &amp; Pistol Club to Rabbi Elli Fischer |url=http://golanirpc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Golani-Response-to-Rabbi-Fischer.pdf |accessdate=2014-11-15 |publisher=Golani Rifle and Gun Club |date=2014-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
while the RCA maintained that the resolution was "not about particular laws and regulations but a critique of elements of American culture that valorize weaponry and violence. That is, it was a broader critique of American gun culture."&lt;ref name=wapo20141003&gt;
{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/10/03/response-from-rabbi-elli-fischer-drafter-of-the-rabbinical-council-of-america-resolution-on-gun-violence/ |title=Response from Rabbi Elli Fischer, chairman of the committee that drafted the Rabbinical Council of America resolution on gun violence|accessdate=2014-11-15 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2014-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The original resolution was passed by a plurality in a vote that included less than ten percent of RCA members participating.&lt;ref name=wapo20140916/&gt;

==Position on women's ordination==
In 2015, the RCA passed a resolution which states, "RCA members with positions in Orthodox institutions may not ordain women into the Orthodox rabbinate, regardless of the title used; or hire or ratify the hiring of a woman into a rabbinic position at an Orthodox institution; or allow a title implying rabbinic ordination to be used by a teacher of Limudei Kodesh in an Orthodox institution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/11/01/news-opinion/united-states/rabbinical-council-of-america-officially-bans-ordination-and-hiring-of-women-rabbis |title=Rabbinical Council of America officially bans ordination and hiring of women rabbis &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2015 |accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Sweden}}

The '''cabinet of Fredrik Reinfeldt''' ({{lang-sv|Regeringen Reinfeldt}}) was the [[Cabinet of Sweden|cabinet]] of [[Sweden]] from 2006 to 2014. It was a [[Coalition government|coalition cabinet]] consisting of the four parties in the [[centre-right]] [[Alliance for Sweden]]: the [[Moderate Party]], [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre Party]], [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]] and the [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democrats]]. 

The cabinet was installed on 6 October 2006, following the [[Swedish general election, 2006|2006 general election]] which ousted the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] after twelve years in power. It retained power after the [[Swedish general election, 2010|2010 general election]] but now as a [[minority government]], and is the longest-serving consecutive non-[[socialist]] government since [[Erik Gustaf Boström]] in 1900. It was led by [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]] of the Moderate Party.

== Controversies and resignations ==
{{see also|Minister affair at the announcement of the Reinfeldt cabinet}}

On October 7, 2006, the day after the new cabinet was announced two of the ministers, the [[Minister for Foreign Trade (Sweden)|Minister for Foreign Trade]] [[Maria Borelius]] and the [[Minister for Culture (Sweden)|Minister for Culture]] [[Cecilia Stegö Chilò]], admitted that they had previously employed persons to take care of their children without paying the appropriate taxes. On October 11, 2006, it came to light that Cecilia Stegö Chilò and her husband had not paid their [[Television licence|TV license]] for the last 16 years. On October 12, 2006, it emerged that two other ministers in the cabinet had neglected to pay the television license; Maria Borelius and the [[Minister for Migration and Asylum Policy (Sweden)|Minister for Migration and Asylum Policy]], [[Tobias Billström]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=5192&amp;date=20061012 Ministers could be reported to police over TV fee] {{en icon}}, ''The Local'', October 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radiotjänst i Kiruna|Radiotjänst i Kiruna AB]], the private agency tasked with collecting the license fee, filed criminal charges against Cecilia Stegö Chilò, Maria Borelius and Tobias Billström.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=5202&amp;date=20061013 Ministers reported to police for unpaid TV licences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310180849/http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=5202&amp;date=20061013 |date=2007-03-10 }} {{en icon}}, ''The Local'', October 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 14, 2006, Maria Borelius resigned as Minister for Foreign Trade. On October 16, 2006, just two days after Maria Borelius' resignation, Minister for Culture Cecilia Stegö Chilò resigned as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=5230&amp;date=20061016 Second Swedish minister resigns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419124626/http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=5230&amp;date=20061016 |date=2012-04-19 }} {{en icon}}, ''The Local'', October 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minister for Defence, [[Mikael Odenberg]], resigned on September 5, 2007, as he thought the budget cuts his department would face were to high.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1042&amp;a=688962|publisher=''Dagens Nyheter''|title=Odenbergs avgång en protest mot nedskärningar|date=September 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 2012, Minister for Defence, [[Sten Tolgfors]], resigned due of his way to deal with the [[Project Simoom]].

== Public perception ==
In public opinion survey conducted by ''[[Aftonbladet]]''/[[Sifo]] in late 2006, the Swedish public was asked to rate each of the new ministers on a 5-graded scale. The average result for the 22 ministers was 2.93.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aftonbladet]]'', January 4, 2007 (not online).&lt;/ref&gt; This is higher than any of the rates that the Social Democratic [[Cabinet of Göran Persson|Persson cabinet]] ever received during its years in power, and the highest ratings ever since the surveys started in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dick Erixon|Erixon, Dick]], "[http://www.erixon.com/2/blogg070114.htm#16 Högsta betyg för svensk regering någonsin]", January 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Swedish general election, 2006]] the opinions for the Reinfeldt cabinet have declined steadily from a level of about 51% down to a level about 40%,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synovate.se/Templates/Page____195.aspx Synovate/Temo Opinion research]&lt;/ref&gt; which election researchers generally explain as more than what could be expected due to normal inter-election popularity fall.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Center-right newspapers in Sweden criticize the cabinet for not being pedagogically proficient,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} while the opposition newspapers just connects the impopularity of the cabinet with the [[Fredrik Reinfeldt#Economical conduct|scandals]] and the performed practical politics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

'''Robbert (Rop) Valentijn Gonggrijp''' (born 14 February 1968) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] and one of the founders of [[XS4ALL]].

==Biography==
Gonggrijp was born in [[Amsterdam]]. While growing up in [[Wormer]] in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Zaan|Zaanstreek area]], he became known as a teenage hacker and appeared as one of the main characters in Jan Jacobs's book ''Kraken en Computers'' (''Hacking and computers'', Veen uitgevers 1985, {{ISBN|90-204-2651-6}}) which describes the early hacker scene in the Netherlands. Moved to [[Amsterdam]] in 1988. Founded the [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] magazine [[Hack-Tic]] in 1989. He was believed to be a major security threat by authorities in the Netherlands and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~fvjole/archief/artikelen/Volkskrant/1993/heu.html Hacking at the End of the Universe (Dutch)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the masthead of [[Hack-Tic]], Gonggrijp described his role as ''hoofdverdachte'' ('prime suspect'). He was convinced that the Internet would radically alter society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hacktic.nl/magazine/0103.htm Hackers beginnen Nederlands eerste kritische computerblad (Dutch)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, a number of people surrounding [[Hack-Tic]] including Gonggrijp founded [[XS4ALL]]. It was the first ISP that offered access to the Internet for private individuals in the Netherlands. Gonggrijp sold the company to the former enemy Dutch-Telecom KPN in 1997. After he left XS4ALL, Gonggrijp founded [[ITSX]], a computer security evaluation company, which was bought by [[Madison Gurkha]] in 2006. In 2001, Gonggrijp started work on the ''Cryptophone'', a [[mobile telephones|mobile telephone]] that can [[encryption|encrypt]] conversations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/11/19/1854226 Encrypted Cell Phone Hits the Market]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1989, Gonggrijp has been the main organizer of [[Hack-Tic#Hack-Tic hacker events|hacker events held every four years]]. Originally organized by the cast of [[Hack-Tic]], these events have continued to live to this day.

Throughout the years, he has repeatedly shown his concerns about the increasing amount of information on individuals that government agencies and companies have access to. Rop held a controversial talk titled "We lost the war"&lt;ref&gt;[https://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/static/t/r/a/Transcribe_We_Lost_The_War_1de1.html Transcribe/We Lost The War]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Chaos Communication Congress]] 2005 in Berlin together with [[Frank Rieger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rop.gonggri.jp/?cat=3 Archive for the 'lost the war' Category]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 he founded the organisation [http://www.wijvertrouwenstemcomputersniet.nl/English "Wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet"] ("We do not trust voting computers") which campaigns against the use of electronic voting systems without a [[Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail]] and which showed in October 2006 on Dutch television how an [[electronic voting|electronic voting machine]] from manufacturer [[Nedap]] could easily be hacked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/79106 Dutch citizens group cracks Nedap's voting computer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117143032/http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/79106 |date=2007-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings were taken seriously both by the Dutch government and by international election observers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/netherlands/24322 The Netherlands Parliamentary Elections, 22 November 2006: OSCE/ODIHR Election Assessment Mission Report], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Warsaw, March 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2008 the Dutch government decided that elections would be held using paper ballots and red pencil only. A proposal to develop a new generation of voting computers was rejected.

'''Social programs in Canada''' include all government programs designed to give assistance to citizens outside what the market provides.  The Canadian [[social safety net]] covers a broad spectrum of programs, and because Canada is a [[Canadian federalism|federation]], many are run by the [[Provinces of Canada|provinces]]. Canada has a wide range of government [[transfer payments]] to individuals, which totaled $176.6 billion in 2009.&lt;ref name="govtransfers"&gt;[http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/govt05a.htm Government transfer payments to persons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081104101532/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/govt05a.htm |date=4 November 2008 }}, [[Statistics Canada]], 8 November 2007. Retrieved 4 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Only social programs that direct funds to individuals are included in that cost; programs such as medicare and public education are additional costs.

== Usage ==
In Canada, the entirety of the social provisions of government are called "social programs" ({{lang-fr|programmes sociaux}}), rather than "social welfare" as in European and British usage.  "Welfare" in Canada, like in the United States, colloquially refers to direct payments to low-income individuals only, and not to healthcare and education spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/bp379-e.htm#PART%20I |title=National Standards and Social Programs: What the Federal Government Can Do (BP379e) |publisher=.parl.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is rarely used as the name of any specific program, however, because of its negative connotations. (In French it is commonly known as 'le bien-être social').  In slang, welfare is also sometimes referred to as "[[the dole]]" (slang, as in British usage).

==History==
Generally speaking before the [[Great Depression in Canada|Great Depression]] most social services were provided by religious charities and other private groups.  Changing government policy between the 1930s and 1960s saw the emergence of a [[welfare state]], similar to many Western European countries.  Most programs from that era are still in use, although many were scaled back during the 1990s as government priorities shifted towards reducing budget deficits that were reaching levels deemed too high.

==Healthcare==
{{main article|Healthcare in Canada|Medicare (Canada)}}
All provinces in Canada provide [[universal healthcare|universal]], [[publicly funded healthcare]] to Canadian citizens, permanent residents and certain temporary residents, with their costs partially subsidized by the federal government.  Approximately 70% of expenditures for [[health care in Canada]] come from public sources, with the rest paid privately (both through private insurance, and through out-of-pocket payments).  The extent of public financing varies considerably across services. For example, approximately 99% of physician services, and 90% of hospital care, are paid by publicly funded sources, whereas almost all dental care and most prescription drug cost are paid for privately. Most physicians are self-employed private entities which enjoy coverage under each province's respective healthcare plans.Compared to other [[single-payer]] health systems in the world, Canada is unusual in banning the purchase of private insurance or care for any services that are listed.  This is meant to prevent what is described as "[[two-tier healthcare]]", which would allow the rich to "jump the queue".  However, in 2005 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in ''[[Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)]]'' that the ban on private care could be unconstitutional if it caused unreasonable delays for patients.

==Education==
{{main article|Education in Canada}}
In Canada, provinces and territories are responsible for their elementary and secondary schools. Education is compulsory up to the age of 16 in most provinces, 17 and 18 in others. Both elementary and secondary education is provided at a nominal cost. Private education is available, but its comparatively high costs and the relative quality of public education result in it being less popular than in the United States or Britain. 
Post-secondary schooling is not free, but is subsidized by the federal and provincial governments. Financial assistance is available through [[Student loans in Canada|student loans]] and bursaries.

==Housing==
{{further information|Public housing in Canada|List of public housing projects in Canada}}
Canadian mortgages are insured by the federal [[Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation]] and most provinces have ministries in charge of regulating the housing market. It was created in the 1940s and in Quebec in 1958.

==Unemployment benefits==
{{main article|Employment Insurance}}

==Low-income support==
All provinces maintain a program of this sort known by names such as "social assistance", "income support", "income assistance" and "welfare assistance"; popularly they are known as ''welfare''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gilles Séguin |url=http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/welfare.htm |title=Welfare |publisher=Canadian Social Research |date= |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of these programs is to alleviate extreme poverty by providing a monthly payment to people with little or no income.  The rules for eligibility and the amount given vary widely between the provinces. The welfare program for low income families exists in all provinces. It was created in the 1940s and in Quebec in 1958. The original plan was for Ottawa to pay half of the financial support for 
families and the other half paid by each of the provinces.

==Seniors==
Most Canadian seniors are eligible for [[Old Age Security]], a taxable monthly social security payment.  In addition, most former workers can receive [[Canada Pension Plan]] or [[Quebec Pension Plan]] benefits based on their contributions during their careers.  As well many people have a private pension through their employer, although that is becoming less common, and many people take advantage of a government tax-shelter for investments called a [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan]] or may save money privately.

==Regional aid==
{{main article|Regions of Canada}}
The government has several agencies dedicated to developing specific regions.

*[[Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency]]
*[[Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency]]
*[[Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec]]
*[[Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario]]
*Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario
*[[Western Economic Diversification Canada]]

==Children and families==

Usually each province has a department or ministry in charge of child welfare and dealing with adoption, foster care, etc.  {{As of|2007}} the federal government also offers the Universal Child Care Benefit to subsidize the cost of [[daycare]] spots or other forms of [[childcare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://etacanadaonline.com/|title=eTA Canada Visa Application — Apply for ESTA Online in Visa Waiver|website=etacanadaonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disability==
{{expand section|date=April 2010}}
The provinces are each responsible for [[disability]] welfare.

* L'Arche - Jean Vanier
* Alberta's program is called [[Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped]]
* The [[Ontario government]] has the [[Ontario Disability Support Program]] which offers [[income]] and [[employment]] assistance for disabled people and the [[Assistive Devices Program]] to provide funding to help pay the cost of [[mobility device|assistive devices]] for people with long-term physical disabilities.

While studies have shown the effects of [[solitary confinement]] to be detrimental to some inmates, '''solitary confinement of women''' has particular consequences for women that may differ from the way it affects men. Solitary confinement rates for women in the [[United States]] are roughly comparable to those for men&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://solitarywatch.com/facts/faq/|title=FAQ|date=2012-01-31|website=Solitary Watch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and about 20% of prisoners will be in solitary confinement at some point during their prison career. Conversely, solitary confinement has also has a very positive effect on women. This article explores both sides of the argument.

== Incidence ==
According to the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]]’ report from 2011-2012, about 20% of female prison inmates and 17% of female jail inmates spent some time in solitary confinement during that year, numbers which are comparable to rates for men.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Solitary confinement is allegedly used to prevent violence within the prison population, and is becoming more common with the prison industrial complex and the rise in incarceration rates.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In most prisons, inmates that are put into solitary confinement fall into one of three categories: disciplinary segregation, voluntary administrative segregation, and involuntary administrative segregation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bottos, Shauna. 2007. ''Profile of Offenders in Administrative Segregation: A Review of the Literature''. Research Report No. B-39. Ottawa: Research Branch, Correctional Service of Canada.
&lt;/ref&gt; Disciplinary segregation is used as a punishment, while administrative segregation is a preventative measure intended to protect either the inmate being isolated or the other inmates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While segregation as a disciplinary measure or a precaution that protects other inmates is allegedly reserved for offenders who have committed violent acts while in prison, women in particular are often put into solitary for much smaller offenses, such as throwing things or talking back to guards.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martel|first=Joane|date=2001-01-01|title=Telling the Story: A Study in the Segregation of Women Prisoners|jstor=29768065|journal=Social Justice|volume=28|issue=1 (83)|pages=196–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often used against women who complain of sexual assault from prison guards or other inmates.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union. 2014. “Worse Than Second-Class: Solitary Confinement of Women in the United States.” Retrieved May 2, 2016 (https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/worse_than_second-class.pdf).
&lt;/ref&gt; Once they are in solitary confinement, women are often monitored more closely and disciplined more harshly than men are.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Disciplinary segregation ===
An offender who has committed a “serious disciplinary offense” may be put in solitary confinement as a punitive measure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Inmates put into disciplinary segregation are not required to be given the same privileges as those put into administrative segregation,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but the duration of their stay in isolation tends to be shorter.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Wichmann, Cherami and Kelly Taylor. 2004. ''Federally Sentenced Women in Administrative Segregation: A Descriptive Analysis''. Research Report No. R-158. Ottawa: Research Branch, Correctional Service of Canada.
&lt;/ref&gt; According to a magazine written by inmates in a California prison, the practice operates under a “guilty until proven innocent” protocol, holding prisoners in solitary confinement even before it is clear that they committed the infraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Preasmyer|first=Amy|date=2014|title=Together we can make a difference|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inmates who are considered to be politically threatening are sometimes put into isolation; although the United States does not officially hold political prisoners, some inmates in solitary confinement are there because of their political activism. This justification often means that minorities are more likely to end up in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Administrative segregation ===
Administrative segregation, or “ad seg," is typically more common than disciplinary segregation, and serves to protect either the inmate being placed in solitary or others in the prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An offender may be put into administrative segregation if they are thought to be dangerous to others or if their own safety is in danger, or if “the inmate has the potential to interfere with an ongoing investigation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Often women who vocalize the fact that they feel threatened by someone else will be put into solitary confinement, and similarly, if they are accused of acting threatening in any way, they are put into solitary without being able to defend themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rojo|first=Misty|date=2014|title=Solitary Torture in Women’s Prisons|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who are put into administrative segregation tend to be those women who have had trouble adjusting to prison life and who are seen as “high-risk” and “high-needs” when they enter the prison.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because this type of segregation is not intended as punishment, inmates in administrative segregation are legally required to be treated in the same way as those in general confinement in the prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Voluntary ====
Women prisoners sometimes request to be put into solitary confinement, most often for their own protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Specifically, some women are thought to request solitary confinement to avoid “further assaults on their identity” that might arise from their interactions and experiences in prison.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martel|first=Joane|date=2006-01-01|title=TO BE, ONE HAS TO BE SOMEWHERE: Spatio—temporality in Prison Segregation|jstor=23639455|journal=The British Journal of Criminology|volume=46|issue=4|pages=587–612}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that women who have been in voluntary administrative segregation tend to have high personal or emotional needs, and some have struggled with substance abuse, although few have difficulty with “community functioning.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Involuntary ====
Women prisoners who are deemed to be dangerous to other prisoners are sometimes put into administrative segregation; a prisoner can also be put in segregation if the officers determine that she herself is in danger and needs this protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Like women who are voluntarily put into segregation, these women tend to have high personal and emotional needs, but many of them also have difficulties functioning in the community or associating with other people.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Women put in segregation ===
In general, women tend to be subjected to harsher disciplinary practices in prisons than men.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Shaylor, Cassandra. 1998. “It's Like Living in A Black Hole: Women of Color and Solitary Confinement in the Prison Industrial Complex.” ''New England Journal on Criminal and Civil Confinement'' 385:390-420.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of solitary confinement, women are often put into segregation for committing small errors while in prison, for example spitting at a guard, while men must commit more violent infractions, such as attacking a guard, for segregation to become necessary.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This could arise from the fact that women in prison are held to especially high standards of femininity, and prisons encourage them to conform to very traditional ideas of being a woman.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This model of femininity requires women to be “pure, passive, heterosexual, and located in motherhood."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When women do not comply with this standard while imprisoned, they are punished further. In fact, some prisons specifically isolate women who seem “butch” or not traditionally feminine.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Arkles, Gabriel. 2009. "Safety and Solidarity Across Gender Lines: Rethinking Segregation of Transgender People in Detention." Temple ''Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review'' 18(2):515-560.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another catalyst for being put into solitary confinement that applies overwhelmingly to women is that prisoners who complain of abusive treatment by guards are often segregated as retaliation. In particular, women who speak out after guards have sexually harassed them are often put into segregation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Not only does this mean that guards who are guilty of sexually harassing inmates go unpunished, it also decreases the likelihood that women will report harassment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In some prisons, women may be put into solitary confinement because their mental health issues prove to be too difficult for the authorities to deal with or are exhausting their resources.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If the prison authorities are unable to address their inmates’ health concerns, they may put them into solitary confinement to avoid solving the problem. This means that the women in solitary confinement are often already at risk for mental health or other challenges, due to previous health concerns or sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Consequences for women ==
Solitary confinement has been shown to be detrimental to the mental and physical well-being of all inmates, but there are some ways in which being put into segregation can be more harmful for women than for men. This is often due to patriarchal structures that exist outside of the prison environment as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They “experience segregation ''as women''”; they are both subjected to slightly different treatment than men are and their perception of this treatment may differ as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Psychological effects ===
Being put into solitary confinement can be very damaging to the mental health of female inmates, particularly those with a history of mental or physical illness, as has been found in a number of studies that observed and interviewed women who were being held in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Being held in a small space without access to objects, recreation, or human contact can lead to [[claustrophobia]], anger, [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[hallucinations]],&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korn|first=Richard|date=1988-01-01|title=The Effects of Confinement in the High Security Unit at Lexington|jstor=29766384|journal=Social Justice|volume=15|issue=1 (31)|pages=8–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; insomnia, and obsessive ideation or fixation on dying.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korn|first=Richard|date=1988-01-01|title=Follow-Up Report on the Effects of Confinement in the High Security Unit at Lexington|jstor=29766385|journal=Social Justice|volume=15|issue=1 (31)|pages=20–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a [[psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] level, inmates in solitary confinement often experience a loss of appetite and/or weight, dizziness, or heart palpitations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Prison staff often do not respond adequately to complaints of any of these symptoms, and sometimes refuse to offer medical care or medication.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Some of the anxiety that inmates, particularly female inmates, experience in solitary confinement comes from a loss or confusion of identity. Prisoners in solitary confinement are not allowed to decorate the small rooms that they are in or to bring most of their possessions that they were allowed in general confinement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This prevents the women from having any sort of entertainment, but also exacerbates feelings of a loss of individuality and of personal identity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Studies of the conditions of segregation, and interviews with the women who are subjected to them, have shown that women may also experience a collapse or confusion of identity while in prison because of their removal from their community and because of the unusual experience of space and time while in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Prisoners attach a lot of importance to the items that they have in their rooms; when they are placed into solitary confinement and no longer allowed to keep these identifying objects with them, they begin to lose their sense of self.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Further, because prisoners kept in segregation often interact little with the outside world, and because the routines of eating and cleaning may be different from in general confinement, the women lose their ability to mark time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ''The Fire Inside'' magazine, written by offenders in California women’s prisons, quotes one prisoner as saying that her recommendation for those held in solitary confinement is “to create a schedule” and figure out the time of day, because it “helps to assert control over your own life and not be totally defined by whatever ‘routine’ the prison is forcing on you.”&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitehorn|first=Laura|date=2014|title=Surviving Solitary|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of their identity that is destroyed is their ability to form relationships with others. In most societies, women are perceived as being particularly social; having relationships with other people is seen as an essential element of their role as women in particular. This is of course impossible when in solitary confinement. It has been argued that this has a harmful effect on women especially. These conclusions were drawn from interviews with women who were still in solitary confinement, women who had been in solitary but had since been transferred back to the general prison population, and women who had been in solitary but had been released from incarceration, suggesting that these effects carry over beyond their time in segregation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some prisons do allow inmates in solitary confinement to use recreation rooms and exercise yards, but these are often monitored by cameras, creating a sense of powerlessness and humiliating and deterring the women from using these facilities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Feelings of powerlessness or hopeless are exacerbated by the fact that women are often unsure of how long they will be held in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

All of these factors combined can have different effects on women, making them either increasingly anxious or increasingly indifferent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While some women feel desperate and angry, others attempt to feel as little as possible in order to mitigate the effects of segregation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Because of the detrimental effect on their mental stability, inmates in solitary confinement often resort to self-harm; this behavior is more common in women than in men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can sometimes lead to women being held in solitary confinement for longer, as punishment for their destructive actions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similarly, it reinforces the guards’ perceptions of these women as particularly violent or dangerous to the rest of the prison community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Sexual abuse ===
Women in solitary confinement are often watched over by male guards, which can result in [[sexual harassment]] ranging from discomfort caused by guards watching them during private moments to nonconsensual sexual contact.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Male guards often are present while women shower or undress, stripping away the women’s right to the privacy of their own bodies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because women in solitary confinement experience so little human contact, the gaze of their guards is often the only interaction that they have with another person; this can exacerbate the feelings of loss of privacy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Similarly, the clothing the women are required to wear is [[sexualization|sexualized]] and humiliating.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In some prisons, women in segregation wear a "[[Babydoll|baby doll]]," a long shapeless dress, with no underclothes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although men sometimes are required to wear the “baby doll” as well, women find that wearing it while being watched by their male guards is degrading and makes them feel powerless.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Beyond this, women in segregation are sometimes subjected to sexual abuse or physical harassment by their male guards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They are often forced to undergo thorough strip searches, during which the guards are more forceful and invasive than is strictly necessary&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and serves mostly to demonstrate the guards’ authority over the inmates.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Because so many female inmates have been victims of sexual or physical abuse, this forces them to relive the trauma of their previous abuse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This can be especially devastating for women whose [[mental state]]s are already deteriorating, due to prior [[mental illness]] or to the effects of being in segregation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It can also result in pregnancy, and pregnant women in solitary confinement—whether the pregnancy was a result of a rape by a guard or not—are often denied proper medical care.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Women have also reported stories of being publicly humiliated when asking for additional [[sanitary napkin|sanitary pads]] during their menstrual periods,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or being forced to hand in their used pads in order to acquire a new one, according to the women who contributed to ''The Fire Inside'' magazine.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They are entirely dependent on male guards, even for such personal needs as this.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Separation from children ===
Women are more likely than men to be the primary guardian of a child or children; having a mother who is in solitary confinement, then, can be very detrimental to the children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Inmates in solitary confinement have much less frequent contact with family members, and when they do, they are usually separated by a partition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although inmates are allowed some visits from immediate family members, a long background check is required.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Children with mothers in prison are at a greater risk for depression or anxiety, substance abuse, or involvement in crime.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These factors are only furthered by the more distanced relationship that becomes necessary with a mother in solitary confinement and the restrictions on visitation that accompany that.

=== Reentry ===
Women who are released from solitary confinement into the general prison population are more likely than men to experience stigmatization and humiliation from the prison guards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This often leads to them isolating themselves and not interacting with other prisoners even when they are not in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Once they are released from prison, too, they often have a harder time adjusting to being a part of society again, and frequently end up back in prison.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ex-offenders who were held in solitary confinement are more likely to commit violent acts against others once released than those who spent all their time in the general prison population.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; As one California prisoner who wrote for ''The Fire Inside'' prison magazine put it, “We go through these kind of mental, emotional, and spiritual stages. At first when you get here you’re angry and disoriented…Paranoia sets in…I slowly began to think of this cell as my safe place…What happens next year when they take the box away?” She, and other women in solitary confinement, become unequipped to deal with the outside world and the knowledge of technological advancement, social interaction skills, and mental stability that it requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2014|title=Stages of the SHU|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positive effects ==
Solitary confinement is also known to have very positive effects on women. For example, ones needs are taken care of as food, shelter and a warm place to sleep are provided for the women. Moreover, a small solitary confinement cell is usually locked by a door or by bars, meaning that they are safe and secure from other violent inmates. Security survellance ensures that a female solitary confinement inmate has the highest welfare standards avaliable to them. Many women begin to love their solitary confinement cell and take comfort in the fact they are being taken care of. &lt;ref&gt;Solitarie en femme, K.Chould p.33-54&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women of color in solitary confinement ==
In general, women of color, like men of color, are more likely to be put in prison than white women and men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Likewise, they are thought to be somewhat disproportionately represented in the solitary confinement population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Margo|first=Schlanger,|date=2013-01-01|title=Prison Segregation: Symposium Introduction and Preliminary Data on Racial Disparities|url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/articles/461/|journal=Michigan Journal of Race and Law|volume=18|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that in 2011-2012, 16% of white prison inmates, 20% of black/African American prison inmates, 16% of Hispanic or Latino prison inmates, and 20% of prison with some other racial identification were in solitary confinement at some point. The difference was slightly less pronounced in jails, with 17% of white, 17% of black/African American, 15% of Hispanic/Latino, and 21% of other inmates spending time in solitary confinement. There is no data available that specifically documents the intersection between race and gender.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=5433|title=Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) - Use of Restrictive Housing in U.S. Prisons and Jails, 2011–12|website=www.bjs.gov|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the number of people of color in isolation is only slightly higher than the number of white people, their experiences in solitary confinement may differ. Women in solitary confinement are treated as less than human, in ways which parallel not only the larger societal degradation of women but also that of people of color. The sexually abusive nature of their interactions with the guards, and the denial of medical care, social contact, and resources, can be seen as racialized. In particular, guards often refer to women in solitary confinement using slurs that are both misogynist and racist.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Women who are put into solitary confinement are often isolated because of actions that challenge dominant perspectives of femininity. Because women of color are often seen as possessing these non-feminine qualities already, they are more susceptible to being put into solitary confinement because of this kind of behavior. Black women are often perceived as “aggressive and recalcitrant,” Latina women are thought to be “loud and belligerent, sexually aggressive, or…unable to speak English,” and Native American women are seen as “backward, savage, and/or primitive.” Because of these preconceptions, women of color are thought to deviate strongly from the feminine ideal, which can be grounds for putting them in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Representations of crime in popular media serve to perpetuate racial stereotypes as well. Offenders of color, including women, are often portrayed as violent, hypersexual, or drug-addicted. While this is true of women of color in the general prison population as well as those held in solitary confinement, there is a particularly strong culture of fear that is built up around segregation units and the prisoners who are held there.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Inmates who appear to belong to particular minority groups are often profiled by prison guards as more likely to be dangerous, violent, or involved in a gang, and therefore are moved into isolation; for example, prisoners who speak a language other than English are sometimes targeted as foreign and therefore gang-involved or dangerous.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kerness|first=Bonnie|last2=Lewey|first2=Jamie Bissonette|date=2014-01-01|title=Race and the Politics of Isolation in U.S. Prisons|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15456870.2014.860146|journal=Atlantic Journal of Communication|volume=22|issue=1|pages=21–41|doi=10.1080/15456870.2014.860146|issn=1545-6870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transgender inmates in solitary confinement ==
[[Transgender]] or [[gender variance|gender nonconforming]] people are overrepresented in prisons, especially transgender people of color. This could be partly due to the fact that they are disproportionately homeless or living in poverty, conditions which more often lead to incarceration, and because they are targeted by the police and perceived as violent or sexually promiscuous (transgender women in particular). These misconceptions can also be used as reasons that guards place transgender inmates in solitary confinement. The issues that cisgender women face in prisons in general and in solitary confinement in particular can be exacerbated for transgender women, and for transgender men as well. For example, transgender inmates are much more likely to be sexually assaulted than their [[cisgender]] counterparts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Allegedly to protect against this kind of thing, transgender offenders are often put into solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Transgender women are sometimes put in male prisons and then separated from the general prison population and put in “protective custody,” which functions in the same ways as solitary confinement,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and in fact transgender inmates are sometimes put into segregation facilities that have worse conditions than the ones that cisgender inmates are in.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edney|first=Richard|date=2004-11-01|title=TO KEEP ME SAFE FROM HARM? TRANSGENDER PRISONERS AND THE EXPERIENCE OF IMPRISONMENT|url=https://ojs.deakin.edu.au/index.php/dlr/article/view/247|journal=Deakin Law Review|volume=9|issue=2|pages=328–338|issn=1835-9264}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to be for their own safety, since most harassment and assault comes from other prisoners. However, this does not prevent the violence perpetrated by prison guards. Further, while transgender women are often put into confinement to keep them from becoming victims of violence, they are sometimes held near inmates who have been put into confinement because of past violent actions, and then experience violence from those inmates.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Being in solitary confinement can have consequences for transgender women’s mental and physical health, in particular because transgender people are already more likely to suffer from depression or other mental illness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Prisoners, and especially those in solitary confinement, do not always have access to the necessary medications, and transgender people specifically are often denied access to the hormones that they take.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Transgender inmates in some prisons are able to form communities with each other or with cisgender inmates, and these relationships both help prevent violence and help support those who have experienced it. Studies have been reported in which men have bonded together to prevent a transgender woman in their facility from being sexually assaulted, and to help transgender women get access to medication they needed. These groups sometimes commit violent acts to defend or avenge a friend who has been hurt, as in the case in a New York men’s prison when a group of men killed another man who had attacked a young female transgender inmate; however, despite this violence, it is evident that transgender women sometimes form strong and protective bonds with other inmates that are taken away in solitary confinement. In fact, this is sometimes the purpose of segregating inmates.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Despite all this, some transgender women, just like some cisgender women, do in fact request to be put into solitary confinement for their own safety. This is not the norm, however, and most women find it to be a painful and harmful experience.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The '''Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute''' ('''SAAMI''', pronounced "Sammy") is an association of [[United States|American]] [[firearm]]s and [[ammunition]] manufacturers. SAAMI publishes various industry standards related to the field, including fire code, ammunition and chamber specifications, and [[Small arms ammunition pressure testing|acceptable chamber pressure]].&lt;ref name="home"&gt;[http://www.saami.org/ SAAMI web site home page]&lt;/ref&gt;
Only manufacturers that are members of SAAMI are bound by the Institute's guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handgunsmag.com/2010/09/24/ammunition_demystplusp_0306-7/ Demystifying +P By Dan Johnson]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
SAAMI was founded in 1926 at the behest of the US government, with a charter to create standards, coordinate technical data, and promote firearms safety.&lt;ref name="home"/&gt; For example, they publish a list of ''Unsafe Arms and Ammunition Combinations'' which details situations where a smaller cartridge may fit in firearms designed for a larger cartridge, but would be unsafe to use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saami.org/specifications_and_information/publications/download/SAAMI_ITEM_211-Unsafe_Arms_and_Ammunition_Combinations.pdf  Unsafe Arms and Ammunition Combinations at SAAMI web site]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a [[.44 Magnum]] cartridge will chamber in a [[.45 Colt]] firearm but operates at a higher pressure and would be unsafe. SAAMI is an accredited standards developer for the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI).

SAAMI standards are voluntary, and are not incorporated into federal law in the [[United States]].

==SAAMI Committees==
SAAMI's work is broken up in various committees each with a specific charter.&lt;ref name="home"/&gt;

===Technical===
The ''Technical Committee'' does the main work of SAAMI. It is their job to set standards for ammunition and firearms. They interface with their European counterpart [[Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives|C.I.P.]] to try to develop common, internationally recognized standards.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.saami.org/Technical.cfm Technical Committee]" at SAAMI web site&lt;/ref&gt; The technical committee provides an industry glossary to facilitate better communication.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.saami.org/Glossary/index.cfm Glossary of Industry terms]" at SAAMI web site&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logistics and Regulatory Affairs===
The Logistics and Regulatory Affairs'' committee (also called SLARAC) is responsible for helping create transportation and store regulations. This is done mostly through educating people and agencies on safe practices.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.saami.org/Regulatory.cfm Regulatory Affairs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910131945/http://www.saami.org/Regulatory.cfm |date=2007-09-10 }}" at SAAMI web site&lt;/ref&gt; They work with and are members of:
*International Code Council
*International Fire Code
*National Fire Protection Association
*Dangerous Good Advisory Council
*International Society of Explosive Engineers

===Legal &amp; Legislative===
SAAMI Legal and Legislative Affairs Committee tracks and lobbies for and against legislation, and works with regulatory agencies such as the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] to represent their member's interests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saami.org/LL/index.cfm Legal &amp; Legislative committee] at SAAMI&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
The Environmental Committee works on science-based management of environmental issues such as wildlife, conservation, and human health as they relate to products produced by SAAMI member companies. Their goal is "A clean and healthy ecosystem."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saami.org/Environment/index.cfm Environmental Committee] at SAAMI&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===
Internationally, SAAMI is an accredited United Nations ECOSOC Non-Government Organization (NGO) with Consultative Status. It is their task to be a technical resource for various decision making groups inside the UN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saami.org/United_Nations.cfm United Nations] at SAAMI web site&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicting industry standards==
The international equivalent of SAAMI is the ''[[Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives]]'' (French for "Permanent international commission for testing portable firearms") commonly abbreviated as C.I.P.

Despite working together, the two main industry standards organizations SAAMI and C.I.P. have assigned different standards for some [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]]. This leads to officially sanctioned conflicting differences between European and American ammunition and chamber dimensions and maximum allowed chamber pressures.

Some cartridges with possible chamber and ammunition dimensional conflicts, similar to the ''unsafe combinations'' listed above, are listed in the [[Delta L problem]] article.

===Proof test differences===
Under SAAMI proof test procedures, for bottlenecked cases the center of the transducer is located {{convert|.175|in|mm|abbr=on}} behind the shoulder of the case for large diameter ({{convert|.250|in|mm|abbr=on}}) transducers and {{convert|.150|in|mm|abbr=on}} for small diameter ({{convert|.194|in|mm|abbr=on}}) transducers. For straight cases the center of the transducer is located one-half of the transducer diameter plus {{convert|.005|in|mm|abbr=on}} behind the base of the seated bullet.  Small transducers are used when the case diameter at the point of measurement is less than {{convert|.35|in|mm|abbr=on}}.

Under C.I.P. proof test standards a drilled case is used and the piezo measuring device (transducer) will be positioned at a distance of {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} from the breech face when the length of the cartridge case permits that, including limits. When the length of the cartridge case is too short, pressure measurement will take place at a cartridge specific defined shorter distance from the breech face depending on the dimensions of the case.

The difference in the location of the pressure measurement gives different results than the C.I.P. standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frfrogspad.com/miscellk.htm Miscellaneous Questions #11]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sports Federation Union of Catalonia''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Unió de Federacions Esportives de Catalunya''), generally known by its acronym '''UFEC''' is a private and non-profit sports association founded in 1933 under the name of the '''Catalan Union of Sports Federations''' (Catalan: ''Unió Catalana de Federacions Esportives'', UCFE) and restored in 1985 by the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]]. Its mission is to coordinate and grow the Catalan sports federations. Its headquarters are in [[Barcelona]], Spain.

The current president of the UFEC is Gerard Esteva i Viladecans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufec.cat/ufec/consell-directiu|date=8 September 2014|title=Consell directiu|work=UFEC|language=Catalan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908181043/http://www.ufec.cat/ufec/consell-directiu|archivedate=8 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antecedents ==

The Catalan Union of Sports Federations (''UCFE'') was created to fill the gap that the Sports Confederation of Catalonia, founded in 1922, had left.&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;{{cite book|title=Enciclopèdia de l'esport català|location=Barcelona|publisher=Enciclopèdia Catalana|year=2012|isbn=978-84-412-1956-4|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederation had entered into a deep crisis until practically disappearing at the end of 1931. The sports federations saw the need to work in a coordinated fashion at the beginning of 1933, which was when they set up a commission to draft the constitution of a new entity that would represent Catalan federated sports.

== History ==

=== Constitution ===

==== Catalan Union of Sports Federations ====

UCFE was constituted on 3 July 1933 at the headquarters of its main backer, the Catalan Fighting Federation, in an assembly of federations called for that purpose. Representatives from a dozen Catalan sports entities were present. Six others joined in, bringing the number of founders to 18 federations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufec.cat/ufec/estatuts|date=21 October 2014|title=Estatuts UCFE|work=UFEC|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Official incorporation by the Generalitat ====

The Union was declared an official corporation by the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]] on 17 July 1934 through decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1934/08/02/pagina-1/621808/pdf.html|date=21 October 2014|title=La Generalidad de Cataluña ha dado su primer decreto deportivo|work=Mundo Deportivo, 2 agost 1934|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree specified that in order to achieve official status, an advisory board would be created with the mission of collaborating with the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]] in coordinating and regulating Catalan sports.

The UCFE ceased its activity in 1936 due to the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0248239.xml|title=Unió de Federacions Esportives Catalanes|work=L'Enciclopèdia.cat|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The restoration ===

The UFEC was restored 49 years later, after Franco's dictatorship and after the State of Autonomies had been established. The Generalitat of Catalonia revived the organisation through the 196/85 Decree of 15 July 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Decret del 196/85, de 15 de juliol de 1985, de constitució de la UFEC&lt;/ref&gt; The decree created the Union of Catalan Sports Federations ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Unió de Federacions Esportives Catalanes''), which changed its name to the Sports Federation Union of Catalonia (Catalan: ''Unió de Federacions Esportives de Catalunya'') in 1996, under the presidency of David Moner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pujades, Xavier; Santacana|first=Carles|title=La història il·lustrada de l'esport a Catalunya.|location=Barcelona|publisher=Columna|year=1994|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

18 presidents of Catalan sports federations met a week later, on 23 July 1985 and agreed to call for an assembly that would constitute the UFEC, elect the board of directors, elect the president and write its statutes. The assembly was celebrated on 31 July at the function hall of the General Direction of Sport for Catalonia, with the participation of 39 of the 47 Catalan federations that were legally constituted at the time.

Joan de la Llera, president of the Catalan Gymnastics Federation, was chosen as the provisional president for the UFEC as the only candidate with support of 39 federations. Nine members were also chosen for the provisional board of directors: Francesc Josep d'Abadal (Catalan Polo Federation), Jordi Batalla (Olympic Archery Federation), Francesc Colomer (Riding Federation), Àngel Font (Motorsports Federation), Joan Garrigós (Federation of Hiking Entities of Catalonia), Francesc Isard (Winter Sports Federation), Josep Maria Martí (Petanque Federation), Joan Maria Roig (Sailing Federation) and Emili Serna (Judo Federation).

The provisional board of directors wrote the statutes which were approved unanimously in an assembly celebrated on 18 November 1985 at the hall of the Catalan Basketball Federation, with the presence of 26 federations.

Once the UFEC was constituted and its statutes approved, an electoral process was started to choose the definitive president and board of directors. An Extraordinary General Assembly was held on 19 December 1985, once again in the hall of the General Direction of Sport for Catalonia. Joan de la Llera, the sole candidate, was elected as the definitive president. The first board of directors was elected with him: Guillem Ros (Athleticism Federation) as first vice-president; Àngel Font (Motorsports Federation) as second vice-president; Josep Ferrer Peris (Tennis Federation) as treasurer; Josep d'Abadal (Polo Fedederation) as secretary and five board members: Joan Anton Camuñas (Sailing Federation), Enric Piquet (Basketball Federation), Jordi Batalla (Olympic Archery Federation), Antoni Guasch (Football Federation) and Joan Garrigós (Federation of Hiking Entities of Catalonia). The first board meeting was held on 16 January 1986, where Francesc Martínez i Massó, ex-president of the Hiking Federation was nominated as general secretary.

A new chapter for sports was opened with the publication of Decree 70/1994 on 22 March, which regulated Catalan sports federations and was consolidated on 31 July with the 1/2000 Sport Law.&lt;ref name="Llei"&gt;Llei de l’esport 1/2000, de 31 de juliol&lt;/ref&gt; Today, 69 Catalan federations are members of the UFEC and benefit from its services and resources.

== Presidencies ==

=== Pompeu Fabra i Poch (1933–36) ===

Apart from his activity as a philologist,&lt;ref name="ref"/&gt; Pompeu Fabra was a sports aficionado. Drawn in mainly by hiking, he was a member of the Catalan Hiking Center from 1891 while he played tennis at the same time. From 1912 onwards he was part of FC Barcelona's tennis division until 1935. He was one of the founders of the Badalone Lawn Tennis Club and a member of the Masnou Tennis Club. From 1927 to 1935 he presided over the Lawn-Tennis Association of Catalonia, the precursor to the Catalan Federation, a title he held while also being president of Palestra from 1930 and president of UCFE. In 1933 he was elected by the Assembly of Federations to be their president, along with Joan Roca as secretary; Francesec Fàbregues as vice-secretary; Lluís Ortín as treasurer; Francesc Guarner as accountant; Càndid Vidal de llobatera as archivist; Joan Boix as librarian and Jaume Güell; Josep Sunyol, Ramon Peypoch as vice-presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdc2.cbuc.cat/cdm/compoundobject/collection/rambla31/id/551/rec/126|date=21 October 2014|title=Unió Catalana de Federacions Esportives|work=La Rambla, núm. 189 (21 ag. 1933), p. 6|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the highest authority in Catalan sports during the Republican years.

There is little information about his mandate as head of UFEC but there are records of the organisation of the First Sports Week between 25 May and 2 June 1935 in which, without official subsidies, a large variety of sports activities were planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1935/05/18/pagina-3/634683/pdf.html|date=21 October 2014|title=Para la I Semana del Deporte|work=Mundo Deportivo, 18 maig 1935|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also the main driver behind a weekly radio show dedicated to the Catalan federations, broadcast by Radio Barcelona between 1934 and 1936.

=== Joan de la Llera Trens (1985–87) ===

De la Llera was president at the same time of UFEC and the Catalan Gymnastics Federation. He was already president of the Catalan Gymnastics Federation, the Catalan Association of Sports Directors and vice-president of the Spanish Gymnastics Federation when he became president of UFEC.

Joan de la Llera lived through 17 October 1986, when Barcelona was nominated for the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], but had very little time to start projects as he died in a car crash on 11 December 1987, shortly before the '''Sports Law''' (Catalan: ''Llei de l'esport'') was passed, a law he had been a firm champion of.

=== Guillem Ros Massot (1987–1988) ===

Guillem Ros became acting president when Joan de la Llera died. Guillem was the president of the Catalan Athleticism Federation and vice-president of the Directors Council of UFEC since its creation and occupied the presidency until May 1988, when Enric Piquet was elected as the new president.

=== Enric Piquet i Miquel (1988–1996) ===

Enric Piquet was president of the Catalan Basketball Federation and was already a member of the board of directors that had been presided by Joan de la Llera. On 26 April 1988 he became the single candidate for the presidency after merging with the other candidate, Alexandre Solar Cabot, president of the Catalan Federation of Modern Pentathlon. In 1992, shortly before the Olympic Games, he was re-elected when UFEC was 57 federations strong. In 1996 he didn't present himself for re-election due to a new law that prevented a federation president from running and he still wanted to be leading basketball. We can highlight from his mandate how he championed the Catalan federations and their role in society, along with the creation of the UFEC Language Services, that have fought for the widespread use of Catalan in sports since 1989. The Generalitat published the 70/1994 Decree of 22 March during his presidency, through which Catalan sports federations were to be regulated.&lt;ref&gt;Decret de federacions 70/1994, de 22 de març&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 UFEC won management rights for the '''Estació del Nord Sports Centre''' , which opened up an important chapter in its process of self-finance.

=== David Moner i Cordina (1996–2014) ===

David Moner become president after winning 25 November 1996 elections over Alexandre Soler-Cabot and Leandre Negre. During his several mandates, through which he was re-elected 4 times without opposition, UFEC intensified its task in promoting, defending and representing Catalan federated sport in its entirety. They worked hand-in-hand with the General Secretary of Sport for the international recognition of Catalan sports teams and started the Catalan Sports Festival. Above all else David Moner worked hard to turn the Union into a services entity with solid financial backing.

UFEC won the 25-year contract to manage the '''Estació del Nord Sports Center''' in 1998. Since then it has worked on expanding and renovating the sports centre, which included adding a swimming pool which was opened to the public in 1999. Other sports centres gradually came under the management of UFEC. In 2004, the [[Catalan Olympic Committee]] (COC), which nowadays still defending its international recognition, was integrate into the UFEC. On 1 July 2014 David Moner left the presidency and Gerard Esteva, after having served as vice-president, became the new president of the UFEC.

== Objectives ==

UFEC's mission&lt;ref name="Llei"/&gt; is representing and promoting federated sport in Catalonia, as well as collaborating with public and private bodies to develop sports in general, ensuring the promotion of Catalan sports teams, federated sports clubs of Catalonia and their athletes in the autonomic as well as international arenas to promote Catalonia as a sporting nation. UFEC is an advisor to the General Secretary of Sport for Catalonia.

== Activities and promotion ==

UFEC offers a media presence to all sports disciplines that are performed in Catalonia, through different pages in newspapers, the weekly ZonaUFEC show which is broadcast through the TV channel Esport3 which belongs to [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]] and its own online television channel UFECtv. Since 2011 it has had its own archive where you can download and watch all published news items.

UFEC also organises different events throughout the year that help people learn about sport in all of its rich variety:

* Catalan Sports Festival
* Silver Badges for Ex-Presidents
* Champions Medal of Catalonia
* Federated Sports Fair
* Female Sports Director of the Year Award
* Cartoon and graphical humour sports contest

== Resources ==

UFEC has its own resources thanks to the management, through different administrative concessions, of 6 sports installations which are: the Estació del Nord sports center, the Complex Esportiu Municipal d'Arella, the Complex Esportiu Municipal Fondo de les Creus d'Arenys de mar, the Complex Esportiu Sot de les granotes a Sant Celona, the Piscina Municipal de Salt and the municipal swimming pools Joan Serra of Sabadell. Another important income stream is the Unifedesport Insurance Company which was created in 2003 to manage insurance policies for federations, clubs, entities, sports centres and their athletes. Profits are distributed amongst the federations.

'''THOMAS''' was the first online database of [[United States Congress]] legislative information.  A project of the [[Library of Congress]], it was launched in January 1995 at the inception of the [[104th Congress]] and retired on July 5, 2016; it has been superseded by [[Congress.gov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.congress.gov/help/faq#thomasretirement | title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): THOMAS Retirement | last= | first= | author= | authorlink= | last2= | first2= | author2= | authorlink2= | date= | year= | editor-last= | editor-first= | editor= | editor-link= | editor1-last= | editor1-first= | editor1-link= | editor2-last= | editor2-first= | editor2-link= | editors= | website= | series= | publisher=[[Library of Congress]] | location= | page= | pages= | at= | language= |trans-title=| type= | format= | arxiv= | asin= | bibcode= | doi= |doi-broken-date=| isbn= | issn= | jfm= | jstor= | lccn= | mr= | oclc= | ol= | osti= | pmc= | pmid= | rfc= | ssrn= | zbl= |id= | accessdate=October 18, 2014 | quote= | ref= | separator= | postscript= | subscription= | registration=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The People of Family''' ({{lang-it|Il Popolo della Famiglia}}, PdF), is a [[social conservative]] [[list of political parties in Italy|political party in Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giuristiperlavita.org/joomla/scrittideisoci/803-e-nato-il-popolo-della-famiglia È nato il Popolo della Famiglia]&lt;/ref&gt; Its leader and President is [[Mario Adinolfi]], former member of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]], writer and director of ''La Croce'' newspaper. The PdF Secretary is Gianfranco Amato, a [[lawyer]] and President of the organization ''Giuristi per la Vita'' ("Jurists for Life"), and its Coordinator is Nicola Di Matteo, founder of the association ''Non si tocca la Famiglia'' ("Don't Touch the Family"); they are all members of the Committee ''Difendiamo i nostri figli'' ("Let's Defend Our Children").&lt;ref&gt;[http://popolodellafamigliaroma.org/blog/2017/03/22/a-tu-per-tu-con-nicola-di-matteo-articolo-su-romanews-it/ A tu per tu con Nicola Di Matteo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
The party was founded in March 2016 from the necessity of giving a political representation to the people who participated in the ''Family Days'' at [[Piazza San Giovanni]] on the 20 June 2015 and at [[Circus Maximus]] on the 30 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.difendiamoinostrifigli.it/progetti/family-day-2016/ Difendiamo i nostri figli]&lt;/ref&gt;

The People of the Family is a non-confessional and value-based political subject, of [[Christianity|Christian]] inspiration, focused on the Social Doctrine of the [[Catholic Church]], open to [[non-believers]] and to other religious confessions who share its program in defense of "non-negotiable" values: the right to life from conception to natural death, the centrality of the [[family]], as established by Article 29 of the [[Italian Constitution]] ("the family as the first natural community based on marriage"), children's right to have a [[father]] and a [[mother]], the PdF also opposes [[same-sex couple|same-sex]] adoptions.

The People of Family's values are mainly centered on the [[Christian faith]], which built the historical and cultural identity of Italy and [[Europe]]. Another fundamental value is represented by the family. According to PdF members, they are the heirs of the great tradition of the [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Italian People's Party]] of Don [[Luigi Sturzo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ilpopolodellafamiglia.it/programma Il Popolo della Famiglia – Il Pogramma]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
The party was labeled by some political commentators as a [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espresso.repubblica.it/palazzo/2014/11/12/news/mario-adinolfi-l-idolo-delle-sentinelle-in-piedi-1.187626 Mario Adinolfi, nuovo guru degli ultra cattolici]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2017/05/03/mario-adinolfi-dieci-motivi-per-cui-cantare-meno-male-che-marione-ce/3559195/ Mario Adinolfi, dieci motivi per cui cantare ‘Meno male che Marione c’è’]&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''timeline of antisemitism''' chronicles the facts of [[antisemitism]], hostile actions or discrimination against [[Jews]] as a religious or ethnic group. It includes events in the history of antisemitic thought, actions taken to combat or relieve the effects of antisemitism, and events that affected the prevalence of antisemitism in later years. The [[history of antisemitism]] can be traced from ancient times to the present day.

Some authors prefer to use the terms [[anti-Judaism]] or [[religious antisemitism]] for religious sentiment against [[Judaism]] before the rise of [[racial antisemitism]] in the 19th century. For events specifically pertaining to the expulsion of Jews, please see [[Jewish refugees]].
{{Antisemitism}}

== Antiquity ==
;740&amp;nbsp;BCE: The [[Assyrian captivity]] (or the Assyrian exile) is the period in the [[history of Ancient Israel and Judah]] during which several thousand Israelites of ancient [[Samaria]] were resettled as captives by [[Assyria]]. The [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Northern Kingdom of Israel]] was conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].

;586&amp;nbsp;BCE: During the reign of King [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] destroys the [[First Temple|temple]] in [[Jerusalem]], and captures the [[Kingdom of Judah]] and 10,000 Jewish families.

;475&amp;nbsp;BCE: [[Haman]] attempts [[genocide]] against the Jews. ([[Purim]]).

;175&amp;nbsp;BCE–165&amp;nbsp;BCE: The Deuterocanonical [[1 Maccabees|First]] and [[2 Maccabees|Second]] ''Books of the Maccabees'' record that [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] attempts to erect a statue of [[Zeus]] in [[Jerusalem]]. The festival of [[Hanukkah]] commemorates the uprising of the [[Maccabees]] against this attempt.

;139 BCE:[[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Hispanus]] expels all Jews from the city of [[Rome]].

;124&amp;nbsp;BCE: The [[woman with seven sons]] was a Jewish [[martyr]], described in [[2 Maccabees]] 7 (2 Maccabees was written c. 124 BCE) and other sources. Although unnamed in 2 Maccabees, she is known variously as Hannah,&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;Gerson D. Cohen, [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08365.html Hannah and Her Seven Sons] at Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt; Miriam,&lt;ref name="Ilan"&gt;Tal Ilan, "[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/hannah-mother-of-seven Hannah, Mother of Seven]," at the Jewish Women's Archive&lt;/ref&gt; and Solomonia.&lt;ref name="Orthodox"&gt;[http://www.antiochian.org/node/19287 Seven Holy Maccabee Martyrs], at the [[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; 2 Maccabees states that shortly before the revolt of [[Judas Maccabeus]] (2 Maccabees 8), [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] arrested a mother and her seven sons, and tried to force them to eat [[pork]]. When they refused, he tortured and killed the sons one by one. The narrator mentions that the mother "was the most remarkable of all, and deserves to be remembered with special honour. She watched her seven sons die in the space of a single day, yet she bore it bravely because she put her trust in the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;2 Maccabees 7:20, [[New English Bible]].&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the sons makes a speech as he dies, and the last one says that his brothers are "dead under God's covenant of everlasting life".&lt;ref&gt;2 Maccabees 7:36, [[Authorised Version]]. [[George Bull]] says of this verse, "I scarce know where to find an instance of greater faith" (in the [[resurrection]] and [[immortality]]) "and fortitude in any of our [[Martyrology|Christian martyrologies]] than here." ''Sermon VIII'', cited in ''The Old Testament According to the Authorised Version With  Brief Commentary by Various Authors. The Apocryphal Books: Esdras to Maccabees'' ([[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]], 1902).&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator ends by saying that the mother died, without saying whether she was executed, or died in some other way.

The [[Talmud]] tells a similar story, but with the refusal to worship an idol replacing the refusal to eat pork. [[Nashim|Tractate Gittin]] 57b cites Rabbi Judah saying that "this refers to the woman and her seven sons" and the unnamed king is referred to as the "Emperor" and "Caesar". The woman commits [[suicide]] in this rendition of the story: she "also went up on to a roof and threw herself down and was killed".&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Talmud: Tractate Gittin [http://www.halakhah.com/gittin/gittin_57.html Folio 57]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions of the story are found in [[4 Maccabees]] (which suggests that the woman might have thrown herself into the flames, 17:1) and [[Josippon]] (which says she fell dead on her sons' corpses&lt;ref name="JVL"/&gt;).

;63 BCE: 12,000 Jews die and many more are sent into [[Jewish diaspora|the diaspora]] as a result of [[Pompey#Pompey in the East|Pompey's conquest of the East]].

;59 BCE: [[Cicero]] criticizes Jews for being too influential in public assemblies. He also refers to Jews and Syrians as "races born to be slaves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cicero, Marcus Tullius°|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/cicero-marcus-tullius-x00b0|website=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;38 BCE: Anti-Jewish riots erupt in [[Alexandria]], countless Jews are killed, synagogues are defiled, Jewish leaders are publicly scourged, and the Jewish population is confined to one quarter of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cahnman|first1=Werner|title=Jews and Gentiles: A Historical Sociology of Their Relations|date=30 November 2003|publisher=Routledge|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vrettos|first1=Theodore|title=Alexandria: City of the Western Mind|date=27 November 2001|publisher=Free Press|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First century ==

;19 CE: Roman Emperor [[Tiberius]] expels Jews from [[Rome]]. Their expulsion is recorded by the Roman historical writers [[Suetonius]], Josephus, and [[Cassius Dio]].

;37–41 CE: Thousands of Jews killed by mobs in the [[Alexandrian pogrom]], as recounted by [[Philo of Alexandria]] in ''Flaccus''.

;50 CE: Jews are ordered by Roman Emperor [[Claudius]] "not to hold meetings", in the words of Cassius Dio (Roman History, 60.6.6). Claudius later expelled Jews from Rome, according to both Suetonius ("Lives of the Twelve Caesars", Claudius, Section 25.4) and Acts 18:2.

;66–73 CE: The [[Great Jewish Revolt]] against the Romans is crushed by [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus]]. Titus refuses to accept a wreath of victory, because there is "no merit in vanquishing people forsaken by their own God." ([[Philostratus]], ''Vita Apollonii''){{citation needed|date=June 2014}}. The events of this period were recorded in detail by the Jewish–Roman historian [[Josephus]]. His record is largely sympathetic to the Roman point of view and it was written in [[Rome]] under Roman protection; hence it is considered a controversial source. Josephus describes the Jewish revolt as being led by "tyrants," to the detriment of the city, and he describes Titus as having "moderation" in his escalation of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)]].

;70 CE: Over 1,000,000 Jews perish and 97,000 are taken as slaves following the destruction of the [[Second Temple]].

;73 CE: Almost all historical information on Masada is from first-century Jewish Roman historian Josephus.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Wikipedia: Masada&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archaeological378"&gt;Murphy-O'Connor, Jerome; Cunliffe, Barry. The Holy Land. Oxford Archaeological Guides (5th ed.). Oxford University Press. pp. 378–381.&lt;/ref&gt; A Roman governor had a legion lay siege to Masada, a mountain fortress.&lt;ref name="archaeological378"/&gt;  They built a 114&amp;nbsp;m (375&amp;nbsp;ft) high assault ramp, during probably two to three months of siege, and then breached the fortress with a battering ram on 16 April.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan B. Campbell, "Capturing a desert fortress: Flavius Silva and the siege of Masada", Ancient Warfare Vol. IV, no. 2 (Spring 2010), pp. 28–35. The dating is explained on pp. 29 and 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Josephus, presumably based upon Roman commander commentaries accessible to him, when Romans entered the fortress they found its defendants had set all buildings but food storerooms ablaze and committed mass suicide or killed each other, 960 men, women, and children in total.&lt;ref name="archaeological378"/&gt; Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of staff, Moshe Dayan, began having the swearing-in ceremony of Armoured Corps soldiers on top of Masada, ending with, "Masada shall not fall again.".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

;94 CE: Fabrications of [[Apion]] in [[Alexandria, Egypt]], including the first recorded case of [[blood libel]]. [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]] writes anti-Jewish poetry. [[Josephus]] picks apart contemporary and old antisemitic myths in his work ''[[Against Apion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/author?name=Josephus,%20Flavius|title=Project Gutenberg Titles by Flavius Josephus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;96 CE: [[Titus Flavius Clemens]], nephew of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Vespasian]] and supposed convert to Judaism is put to death on charges of atheism.

;100 CE: [[Tacitus]] writes anti-Jewish polemic in his ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+5.1 book 5]). He reports on several old myths of ancient antisemitism (including that of the donkey's head in the Holy of Holies), but the key to his view that Jews "regard the rest of mankind with all the hatred of enemies" is his analysis of the extreme differences between [[monotheistic]] Judaism and the [[polytheism]] common throughout the Roman world.

== Second century ==

;115–117: Thousands of Jews are killed during civil unrest in Egypt, [[Cyprus]], and [[Cyrenaica]], as recounted by [[Cassius Dio]].

;119: [[Roman Emperor]] [[Hadrian]] bans [[circumcision]], making Judaism ''de facto'' illegal.

;132–135: Crushing of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]. According to Cassius Dio 580,000 Jews are killed. Hadrian orders the expulsion of Jews from Judea, which is merged with [[Galilee]] in order to form the province of [[Syria Palaestina]]. The purpose of this name change was to suppress the Jewish people's connection to their historic homeland ([[Judea]] / [[Land of Israel]]). (For other antisemitic actions resulting from this name change, see events of [[Timeline of antisemitism#20 century|1967]] below) Although large Jewish populations remain in [[Samaria]] and Galilee, with [[Tiberias]] as the headquarters of exiled Jewish [[patriarchs]], this is the start of the [[Jewish diaspora]]. Hadrian constructs a [[Paganism|pagan]] temple to Jupiter at the site of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], builds [[Aelia Capitolina]] among the ruins of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Lehmann"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usd.edu/erp/Palestine/history.htm#135-337 |title=Palestine: History: 135–337: Syria Palaestina and the Tetrarchy |accessdate=19 July 2006 |last=Lehmann |first=Clayton Miles |date=May–September 1998 |work=The On-line Encyclopedia of the Roman Provinces |publisher=University of South Dakota |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060717061703/http://www.usd.edu/erp/Palestine/history.htm#135-337 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 17 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;136: Hadrian renames [[Jerusalem]] to Aelia Capitolina and builds a Roman monument over the site of the [[Temple Mount]]. Jews are banned from visiting. Judea is renamed Palestine to suppress the Jewish connection with the land.

;167: Earliest known accusation of [[Jewish deicide]] (the notion that Jews were held [[responsible for the death of Jesus]]), made in a sermon ''On the Passover'', attributed to [[Melito of Sardis]].

;175: [[Apollinaris Claudius|Apollinaris the Apologist]] writes two books against the Jews.

== Third century ==
;212: Emperor Caracalla allows all Jewish men within the Roman Empire to become full Roman citizens.

;224: [[Jews]] in Italy face forced conversion.

;250: Jews of [[Carthage]] are expelled.

;259: The Jewish community of [[Nehardea]] is destroyed.

== Fourth century ==
;306: The [[Synod of Elvira]] bans intermarriage between [[Christianity|Christians]] and [[Jew]]s. Other social intercourses, such as eating together, are also forbidden.

;315: [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] enacts various laws regarding the Jews: Jews are not allowed to own Christian slaves or to circumcise their slaves. Conversion of Christians to Judaism is outlawed. Congregations for religious services are restricted, but Jews are also allowed to enter the restituted Jerusalem on the anniversary of the Temple's destruction.

;325: Jews are expelled and banned from [[Jerusalem]].

;325: [[First Council of Nicaea|First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea]]. The [[Christian Church]] separates the calculation of the date of [[Easter]] from the Jewish [[Passover]]: "It was ... declared improper to follow the custom of the Jews in the celebration of this holy festival, because, their hands having been stained with crime, the minds of these wretched men are necessarily blinded.... Let us, then, have nothing in common with the Jews, who are our adversaries. ... avoiding all contact with that evil way. ... who, after having compassed the death of the Lord, being out of their minds, are guided not by sound reason, but by an unrestrained passion, wherever their innate madness carries them. ... a people so utterly depraved. ... Therefore, this irregularity must be corrected, in order that we may no more have any thing in common with those parricides and the [[deicide|murderers of our Lord]]. ... no single point in common with the perjury of the Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf203.iv.viii.i.x.html|title=NPNF2-03. Theodoret, Jerome, Gennadius, &amp; Rufinus: Historical Writings—Christian Classics Ethereal Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/25023.htm ''Life of Constantine'' Vol. III Ch. XVIII] by Eusebius&lt;/ref&gt;

;330: [[Rabbah bar Nahmani]] is forced to flee to the forest where he dies.

;339: Intermarriage between Christians and Jews is banned in the Roman Empire, declaring the punishment death.

;351: [[Book burning]] of Jewish texts in [[Persia]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

;351–352: [[Jewish revolt against Constantius Gallus]]. Jews rise up against the corrupt rule of Gallus. Many towns are destroyed, thousands are killed.

;353: [[Constantius II]] institutes a law stating that any Christian who [[converts to Judaism]] will have their property confiscated.

;361: Roman Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]], allows the Jews to return to "Holy Jerusalem which you have for many years longed to see rebuilt" and to rebuild the Temple.

: "...their prayer books and Talmudic writings... be taken from them..."
: "...their rabbis be forbidden to teach henceforth on pain of loss of life and limb..."
: "...safe-conduct on the highways be abolished completely for the Jews..."
: "...usury be prohibited to them, and that all cash and treasure of silver and gold be taken from them..." and "Such money should now be used in ... the following [way]... Whenever a Jew is sincerely converted, he should be handed [certain amount]..."
: "...young, strong Jews and Jewesses [should]... earn their bread in the sweat of their brow..."
: "If we wish to wash our hands of the Jews' blasphemy and not share in their guilt, we have to part company with them. They must be driven from our country" and "we must drive them out like mad dogs."

== Twentieth century ==
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] adhered to a distinction between "good antisemitism" and "bad antisemitism". The "bad" kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian. The "good" kind criticized alleged Jewish conspiracies to control newspapers, banks, and other institutions, to care only about accumulation of wealth, etc. Many Catholic bishops wrote articles criticizing Jews on such grounds, and, when accused of promoting hatred of Jews, would remind people that they condemned the "bad" kind of antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kertzer]], ''The Popes Against the Jews''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first pogrom, in spring, claimed 170 victims; the second one, in summer, more than 90. This time the Christian inhabitants helped to hide the Jews. The Council for Public Peace, with a Christian majority and a Jewish minority, saved the city from danger several times. In 1920, for example, it stopped the pogrom initiated by the troops of General [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]], second edition, vol. 20, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter section included a brief discussion of the "Jewish problem" (''Problem żydowski''): "So long as Jews remain Jews, a Jewish problem exists and will continue to exist (...) It is a fact that Jews are waging war against the Catholic church, that they are steeped in free-thinking, and constitute the vanguard of atheism, the Bolshevik movement, and revolutionary activity. It is a fact that Jews have a corruptive influence on morals and that their publishing houses are spreading pornography. It is true that Jews are perpetrating fraud, practicing usury, and dealing in prostitution. It is true that, from a religious and ethical point of view, Jewish youth are having a negative influence on the Catholic youth in our schools."&lt;ref name=modras&gt;{{cite book| last= Modras |first= Ronald |date=1994 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=GUdgbXsA1-EC&amp;pg=PA346&amp; |page= 346 | title = The Catholic Church and Antisemitism: Poland, 1933-1939 | publisher = Overseas Publishers Association N.V.}} Reprinted 2004 by Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Hlond tempered these remarks with an admission that "not all Jews are this way" and forbade assaults on Jews or attacks on their property. Yet, despite a warning to Catholics not to take an anti-Jewish moral stance, interspersed in the letter's words of friendship was an explicit condemnation of Jewish culture and also Judaism for its rejection of [[Christ|Jesus Christ]]: "It is good to prefer your own kind when shopping, to avoid Jewish stores and Jewish stalls in the marketplace (...) One should stay away from the harmful moral influence of Jews, keep away from their anti-Christian culture, and especially boycott the Jewish press and demoralizing Jewish publications. (...) We do not honor the indescribable tragedy of that nation, which was the guardian of the idea of the [[Christ|Messiah]] and from which was born the Savior.

Pentiuc.  The Old Testament in Eastern Orthodox Tradition. Oxford University Press (6 February 2014) {{ISBN|978-0-19-533123-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40}}  This word had caused much trouble in recent times because of misconceptions that the [[Latin]] ''perfidis'' was equivalent to "[[wiktionary:perfidious|perfidious]]", giving birth to the view that the prayer accused the Jews of treachery (perfidy), though the word is more correctly translated as "faithless" or "unbelieving".&lt;ref&gt;This misunderstanding is based on an inadequate understanding of medieval Latin. In classical Latin, ''perfidus'' did have a meaning similar to its present English analogue, derived as it was from the phrase ''per fidem decipere'', "to deceive through trust." However, by late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, ''perfidus'' and ''perfidia'' simply meant the opposite of ''fides'' and ''fidelis''. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=ReCp978iiA8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en#PRA1-PA181,M1 K.P. Harrington, ''Mediaeval Latin'' (1925), p. 181], ''fn'' 5) Thus ''perfidus'' in medieval Latin is best translated as "faithless" or "unbelieving", meaning lacking the Christian faith.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the prayer was revised to read:
:Let us pray also for the Jews: that almighty God may remove the veil from their hearts; so that they too may acknowledge Jesus Christ our Lord. Let us pray. Let us kneel. Arise. Almighty and eternal God, who dost also not exclude from thy mercy the Jews: hear our prayers, which we offer for the blindness of that people; that acknowledging the light of thy Truth, which is Christ, they may be delivered from their darkness. Through the same our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;''Oremus et pro Iudæis: ut Deus et Dominus noster auferat velamen de cordibus eorum; ut et ipsi agnoscant Iesum Christum Dominum nostrum. (''Oremus. Flectamus genua. Levate'') Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui Iudæos etiam a tua misericordia non repellis: exaudi preces nostras, quas pro illius populi obcæcatione deferimus; ut, agnita veritatis tuæ luce, quæ Christus est, a suis tenebris eruantur.

About 180 members were attending a Friday evening service to dedicate the new Zemurray Social Hall, and led by then-rabbi Saul Rubin and Rev. John Speaks and Dr. Franklin Denson of First Methodist Church, when windows were smashed and the synagogue [[Firebombing|fire-bombed]]. Two members—Alvin Lowi and Alan Cohn—who rushed out to see what was happening were met by Jerry Hunt, a 16-year-old [[Neo-Nazism|Nazi sympathizer]], who wounded them both with a [[shotgun]], then fled.

;1961: In 1961, a protégé of  [[Harry Elmer Barnes]], [[David Hoggan]] published ''Der Erzwungene Krieg'' (''The Forced War'') in West Germany, which claimed that Germany had been the victim of an Anglo-Polish conspiracy in 1939. Though ''Der Erzwungene Krieg'' was primarily concerned with the origins of World War II, it also down-played or justified the effects of Nazi [[antisemitic]] measures in the pre-1939 period.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt, Deborah page 71"&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory'', New York : Free Press ; Toronto : Maxwell Macmillan Canada ; New York ; Oxford : Maxwell Macmillan International, 1993 page 71&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Hoggan justified the huge one billion ''Reich''-mark fine imposed on the entire Jewish community in Germany after the 1938 ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' as a reasonable measure to prevent what he called "Jewish profiteering" at the expense of German insurance companies and alleged that no Jews were killed in the ''Kristallnacht'' (in fact, 91 German Jews were killed in the ''Kristallnacht'').&lt;ref name="Lipstadt, Deborah page 71"/&gt;

;1962: In his 1962 pamphlet, ''Revisionism and Brainwashing'', [[Harry Elmer Barnes]] claimed that there was a "lack of any serious opposition or concerted challenge to the atrocity stories and other modes of defamation of German national character and conduct".&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust'', Free Press: New York, 1993, pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes argued that there was "a failure to point out the atrocities of the Allies were more brutal, painful, mortal and numerous than the most extreme allegations made against the Germans".&lt;ref name="Lipstadt, Deborah page 74"&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust'' (New York: Free Press, 1993) p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that in order to justify the "horrors and evils of the Second World War", the Allies made the Nazis the "scapegoat" for their own misdeeds.&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust'', Free Press: New York, 1993, pg. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

;1963: "Judaism Without Embellishments" published by the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR in 1963.

;1964: In a 1964 article, "Zionist Fraud", published in the ''[[American Mercury]]'', [[Harry Elmer Barnes]] wrote: "The courageous author [Rassinier] lays the chief blame for misrepresentation on those whom we must call the swindlers of the crematoria, the Israeli politicians who derive billions of marks from nonexistent, mythical and imaginary cadavers, whose numbers have been reckoned in an unusually distorted and dishonest manner."&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust'', Free Press: New York, 1993 page 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Using Rassinier as his source, Barnes claimed that Germany was the victim of aggression in both 1914 and 1939, and that reports of the Holocaust were propaganda to justify a war of aggression against Germany.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt, Deborah page 74"/&gt;

;1964: The [[Roman Catholic Church]] under [[Pope Paul VI]] issues the document ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' as part of [[Vatican II]], repudiating the doctrine of [[Jewish guilt]] for the [[Crucifixion]].

;1964: In 1964, French historian [[Paul Rassinier]] published ''The Drama of the European Jews''. Rassinier was himself a concentration camp survivor (he was held in [[Buchenwald]] for having helped French Jews escape the Nazis), and modern-day holocaust deniers continue to cite his works as scholarly research that questions the accepted facts of the Holocaust. Critics argued that Rassinier did not cite evidence for his claims and ignored information that contradicted his assertions; he nevertheless remains influential in Holocaust denial circles for being one of the first deniers to propose that a vast Zionist/Allied/Soviet conspiracy faked the Holocaust, a theme that would be picked up in later years by other authors.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah E.

;1965: The [[Frankfurt Auschwitz trials]], known in [[German language|German]] as ''der Auschwitz-Prozess'', or ''der zweite Auschwitz-Prozess,'' (the "second Auschwitz trial") was a series of trials running from 20 December 1963 to 19 August 1965, charging 22 defendants under German [[criminal law]] for their roles in the [[Holocaust]] as mid- to lower-level officials in the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] [[death camp|death]] and [[concentration camp]] complex.

;1967: [[Allen Ginsberg]] stated that, in a private conversation in 1967, [[Ezra Pound]] told the young poet, "my poems don't make sense." He went on to supposedly call himself a "moron", to characterize his writing as "stupid and ignorant", "a mess". Ginsberg reassured Pound that he "had shown us the way", but Pound refused to be mollified:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Any good I've done has been spoiled by bad intentions – the preoccupation with irrelevant and stupid things,' [he] replied. Then very slowly, with emphasis, surely conscious of Ginsberg's being Jewish: 'But the worst mistake I made was that stupid, suburban prejudice of anti-semitism.'&lt;ref name="Carpenter898ff"&gt;Carpenter, Humphrey.

;1970: After the [[Second Vatican Council]], the [[Good Friday prayer for the Jews]] was completely revised for the 1970 edition of the Roman Missal. Because of the possibility of a misinterpretation similar to that of the word "perfidis" (see above in 1959), the reference to the veil on the hearts of the Jews, which was based on {{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|3:14}}, was removed. The 1973 [[ICEL]] English translation of the revised prayer is as follows:
:Let us pray for the Jewish people, the first to hear the word of God, that they may continue to grow in the love of his name and in faithfulness to his covenant. (''Prayer in silence.

;1980: In 1980, the [[Institute for Historical Review]] promised a $50,000 reward to anyone who could prove that Jews were gassed at Auschwitz. [[Mel Mermelstein]] wrote a [[letter to the editor]]s of the ''[[LA Times]]'' and others including ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''. The IHR wrote back, offering him $50,000 for proof that Jews were, in fact, gassed in the gas chambers at Auschwitz. Mermelstein, in turn, submitted a notarized account of his internment at Auschwitz and how he witnessed Nazi guards ushering his mother and two sisters and others towards (as he learned later) gas chamber number five. Despite this, the IHR refused to pay the reward. Represented by public interest attorney [[William John Cox]], Mermelstein subsequently sued the IHR in the [[Superior Court of Los Angeles County]] for [[breach of contract]], [[anticipatory repudiation]], [[libel]], [[injurious denial of established fact]], [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]], and [[declaratory relief]] (see [[case no. C 356 542]]). On 9 October 1981, both parties in the Mermelstein case filed motions for [[summary judgment]] in consideration of which Judge Thomas T.

On 5 August 1985, Judge Robert A. Wenke entered a judgment based upon the [[Stipulation]] for Entry of Judgment agreed upon by the parties on 22 July 1985. The judgment required IHR and other defendants to pay $90,000 to Mermelstein and to issue a letter of apology to "Mr. Mel Mermelstein, a survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau and Buchenwald, and all other survivors of Auschwitz" for "pain, anguish and suffering" caused to them.&lt;ref name="order"/&gt;

;1984: In 1984, [[James Keegstra]], a Canadian high-school teacher, was charged under the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']] for "promoting hatred against an identifiable group by communicating anti-Semitic statements to his students".  During class, he would describe Jews as a people of profound evil who had "created the Holocaust to gain sympathy." He also tested his students in exams on his theories and opinion of Jews.

Keegstra was charged under s 281.2(2) of the ''Criminal Code'' (now s 319(2), which provides that "Every one who, by communicating statements, other than in private conversation, wilfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group" commits a criminal offence.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Code'', RSC 1970, c C-34, s 281.2(2);  now ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 319(2).&lt;/ref&gt;  He was convicted at trial before the [[Alberta Court of Queen's Bench]].

;1988: In 1988, the American historian [[Arno J. Mayer]] published a book entitled ''Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?'', which did not explicitly deny the Holocaust, but lent support to Holocaust denial by stating that most people who died at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] were the victims of "natural causes" such as disease, not gassing.&lt;ref&gt;Dawidowicz, Lucy ''What Is The Use of Jewish History?'', New York: Schocken Books, 1992 pages 129–130&lt;/ref&gt; Mayer also cited the works of Holocaust deniers [[Arthur Butz]] and [[Paul Rassinier]] in his book's bibliography. Critics such as [[Lucy Dawidowicz]] criticized Mayer's citation of deniers, and argued that his statements about Auschwitz were factually incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Dawidowicz, Lucy ''What Is The Use of Jewish History?'', New York: Schocken Books, 1992 page 130&lt;/ref&gt; Holocaust expert [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] has noted that Mayer's book is as close as a mainstream historian has ever come to supporting Holocaust denial.&lt;ref name="Pelt pages 47-48"&gt;Pelt, Robert Jan van ''The Case for Auschwitz'', Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2002 pages 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; Holocaust deniers such as [[David Irving]] have often cited Mayer's book as one reason for embracing Holocaust denial.&lt;ref name="Pelt pages 47-48"/&gt; Though Mayer has been often condemned for his statement about the reasons for the Auschwitz death toll, his book does not deny the use of gas chambers at Auschwitz, as Holocaust deniers often claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Some mainstream Holocaust historians have labeled Mayer a denier. The Israeli historian [[Yehuda Bauer]] wrote that Mayer "popularizes the nonsense that the Nazis saw in Marxism and Bolshevism their main enemy, and the Jews unfortunately got caught up in this; when he links the destruction of the Jews to the ups and downs of German warfare in the Soviet Union, in a book that is so cocksure of itself that it does not need a proper scientific apparatus, he is really engaging in a much more subtle form of Holocaust denial".&lt;ref&gt;Baurer, Yehuda "A Past That Will Not Away" pages 12–22 from ''The Holocaust and History'' edited by Michael Berenbaum and Abrahm Peck, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1998 page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of Mayer argue that his statement that "Sources for the study of the gas chambers at once rare and unreliable" has been taken out of context, particularly by Holocaust deniers.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael &amp; Grobman, Alex ''Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002 page 126.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Shermer]] and [[Alex Grobman]] observe that the paragraph from which the statement is taken asserts that the SS destroyed the majority of the documentation relating to the operation of the gas chambers in the death camps, which is why Mayer feels that sources for the operation of the gas chambers are "rare" and "unreliable".&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael &amp; Grobman, Alex ''Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002 pages 126–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

;1990: For his portrayal of Jewish nightclub owners Moe and Josh Flatbush in the 1990 film ''[[Mo' Better Blues]]'', [[Spike Lee]] drew the ire of the [[Anti Defamation League]], [[B'nai B'rith]], and other such Jewish organizations.

Lee argues that even if the Flatbush brothers are stereotyped figures, their "10 minutes of screen time" is insignificant when compared to "100 years of Hollywood cinema... [and] a slew of really racist, anti-Semitic filmmakers". According to Lee, his status as a successful African-American artist has led to hostility and unfair treatment: "Don't hold me to a higher moral standard than the rest of my filmmaking colleagues... Now that young black filmmakers have arisen in the film industry, all of a sudden stereotypes are a big issue... I think it's reaching the point where ''I'm'' getting reviewed, not my films." Ultimately, however, Lee refused to apologize for his portrayal of the Flatbush brothers: "I stand behind all my work, including my characters, Moe and Josh Flatbush... if critics are telling me that to avoid charges of anti-Semitism, all Jewish characters I write have to be model citizens, and not one can be a villain, cheat or a crook, and that no Jewish people have ever exploited black artists in the history of the entertainment industry, that's unrealistic and unfair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1990-08-22 |title=I Am Not an Anti-Semite|work=The New York Times |author=Spike Lee|page=A25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked for his source, Buchanan said, "somebody sent it to me." Critic Jamie McCarthy says this claim may have come from the German American Information and Education Association's newsletter, a publication he accused of anti-Semitism and [[Holocaust denial]]. He also argues that:

;1991: ''[[The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews]]'', published in 1991, is a book that asserts that Jews dominated the [[Atlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews, Volume 1, http://www.radioislam.org/islam/english/books/secrrel1/The%20Secret%20Relationship%20between%20Blacks%20and%20Jews.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Highlights and Key Points of The Secret Relationship between Blacks and Jews, http://noirg.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TSR.HighlightsKeyPoints1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Austen, pp 131-133.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is 334 pages, includes 1,275 footnotes and over 3,000 sources, including Jewish journals, encyclopedias, newspapers and other publications. Jewish scholars and rabbis, Court records, shipping and estate records, runaway slave notices, auction notices, published sermons, census data, slave bills of sale and tax records are cited. Volume Two of ''The Secret Relationship'' was published in  2010, with the subtitle "How Jews Gained Control of the Black American Economy".&lt;ref&gt;Highlights and Key Points of The Secret Relationship between Blacks and Jews, Volumes 1 and 2, http://noirg.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TSR.HighlightsKeyPoints1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been labeled an [[Antisemitic canard]] by some historians including Saul S. Friedman, who contends that Jews had a minimal role in New World slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;Jews and the American Slave Trade, Saul S. Friedman, Transaction Publishers, 1999 pp. 2, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], head of the department of Afro-American studies at Harvard University, called the book "the Bible of new anti-Semitism" and added that "the book massively misinterprets the historical record, largely through a process of cunningly selective quotations of often reputable sources".&lt;ref&gt;Allah in the West: Islamic movements in America and Europe By Gilles Kepel, Stanford University Press, 1997 pp. 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was criticized for being antisemitic, and for failing to provide an objective analysis of the role of Jews in the slave trade.  Common criticisms were that the book used selective quotes, made "crude use of statistics,"&lt;ref&gt;Austen, p 134.&lt;/ref&gt; and was purposefully trying to exaggerate the role of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Austen p 133-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Ralph A. Austen criticized the book, saying that the "distortions are produced almost entirely by selective citation rather than explicit falsehood.... more frequently there are innuendos imbedded in the accounts of Jewish involvement in the slave trade,"&lt;ref&gt;Austen, p 133.&lt;/ref&gt; and  "[w]hile we should not ignore the anti-Semitism of The Secret Relationship..., we must recognize the legitimacy of the stated aim of examining fully and directly even the most uncomfortable elements in our [Black and Jewish] common past."&lt;ref&gt;Austen, p 136.&lt;/ref&gt;  Austen acknowledges that the book was the first book on the subject aimed at a non-scholarly audience.&lt;ref&gt;Austen, p 131.  "Until recently, this work remained buried in scholarly journals, read only by other specialists. It had never been synthesized in a publication for non-scholarly audience.  A book of this sort has now appeared, however, written not by Jews but by an anonymous group of African Americans associated with the Reverend Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the [[American Historical Association]] (AHA) issued a statement condemning "any statement alleging that Jews played a disproportionate role in the Atlantic slave trade."&lt;ref name="ajh"&gt;Encyclopedia of American Jewish history, Volume 1, pp. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of ''The Secret Relationship'' spurred retorts published specifically to refute the thesis of ''The Secret Relationship'':

* 1992 – Harold Brackman, ''Jew on the Brain: A Public Refutation of the Nation of Islam's The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews''.
* 1992 – [[David Brion Davis]], "Jews in the Slave Trade," in ''Culturefront'' (Fall 1992) pp 42–45.
* 1993 – [[Seymour Drescher]], "The Role of Jews in the Atlantic Slave Trade," ''Immigrants and Minorities'', 12 (1993), pp 113–125.
* 1993 – Marc Caplan, ''Jew-Hatred As History: An Analysis of the Nation of Islam's "The Secret Relationship"'' (Published by the [[Anti Defamation League]]).
* 1998 – Eli Faber, ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight'',  New York University Press.
* 1999 – Saul S. Friedman, ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'', Transaction.

A post-1991 scholar who analyzed the role of Jews in the overall Atlantic slave trade concluded that it was "minimal," and only identified certain regions (such as Brazil and the Caribbean) where the participation was "significant."&lt;ref&gt;Drescher: JANCAST:  p 455:  "only in the Americas&amp;nbsp;– momentarily in Brazil, more durably in the Caribbean&amp;nbsp;– can the role of Jewish traders be described as significant." ... but elsewhere involvement was modest or minimal p 455.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wim Klooster wrote: "In no period did Jews play a leading role as financiers, shipowners, or factors in the Transatlantic or Caribbean slave trades. They possessed far fewer slaves than non-Jews in every British territory in North America and the Caribbean. Even when Jews in a handful of places owned slaves in proportions slightly above their representation among a town's families, such cases do not come close to corroborating the assertions of The Secret Relationship."&lt;ref&gt;Wim Klooster (University of Southern Maine): [http://oieahc.wm.edu/wmq/Jan00/FaberJan00.pdf Review of ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight.''

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] states that Volume Two of ''The Secret Relationship'' blames Jews for "promoting a myth of black racial inferiority and makes a range of conspiratorial accusations about Jewish involvement in the slave trade and in the cotton, textiles, and banking industries".&lt;ref&gt;"Farrakhan in his own words", ADL, [http://www.adl.org/special_reports/farrakhan_own_words2/farrakhan_own_words.asp online].&lt;/ref&gt;

;1991: The United Nations's resolution determining that "Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination" was revoked.

;1991: The [[Crown Heights riot]] was a three-day racial riot that occurred from 19–21 August 1991 in the [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] section of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]]. It turned black residents and [[Orthodox Jewish]] residents against each other, causing deteriorated racial relations. The riots began on 19 August 1991, after two children of [[Guyana|Guyanese]] immigrants were unintentionally struck by an automobile in the motorcade of [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], the [[Rebbe|leader of a Jewish religious sect]]. One child died and the second was severely injured. This event was said to cause tensions between Jewish and black residents to erupt.

In its wake, several Jews were seriously injured; one Orthodox Jewish man was killed; and a non-Jewish man, apparently mistaken by rioters for a Jew, was killed by a group of black men. The riots were a major issue in the 1993 mayoral race, contributing to the defeat of Mayor [[David Dinkins]], an African American, who was blamed for an ineffective police response. Ultimately, black and Jewish leaders developed an outreach program between their communities to help calm and possibly improve racial relations in Crown Heights over the next decade.&lt;ref name=Beep&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/ny_local/2001/08/23/2001-08-23_beep_honor_peace_coalition_c.html "Beep Honor Peace Coalition: Crown Heights leaders reflect on 10-year milestone"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''New York Daily News'', 23 August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

;1991: In December 1991 the [[American Historical Association]] issued the following statement: ''The American Historical Association Council strongly deplores the publicly reported attempts to deny the fact of the Holocaust. No serious historian questions that the Holocaust took place.'' This followed a strong reaction by many of its members and commentary in the press against a near-unanimous decision that the AHA had made in May 1991 that studying the ''significance of the Holocaust'' should be encouraged. The association's May 1991 statement was in response to an incident where certain of its members had questioned the reality of the Holocaust. The December 1991 declaration is a reversal of the AHA's earlier stance that the association should not set a precedent by certifying historical facts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/1991/9112/9112RES.CFM "AHA Statement on Holocaust Denial"], [[American Historical Association]] website.

;1996: The depiction of [[Jew]]s in some of [[T.S. Eliot]]'s poems has led several critics to accuse him of anti-Semitism.

;2000s: [[Craig Raine]], in his books ''In Defence of [[T. S. Eliot]]'' (2001) and ''T. S. Eliot'' (2006), sought to defend Eliot from the charge of anti-Semitism. Reviewing the 2006 book, Paul Dean stated that he was not convinced by Raine's argument. Nevertheless, he concluded, "Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains."&lt;ref name = "Dean"/&gt; In another review of Raine's 2006 book, the literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] also questioned the validity of Raine's defense of Eliot's character flaws as well as the entire basis for Raine's book, writing, "Why do critics feel a need to defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot's well-earned reputation [as a poet] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] does him no favours."&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry.

;2000: ''[[David Irving v Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt]]'' is a case in English law, decided in 2000, against American author [[Deborah Lipstadt]] and her publisher Penguin Books, filed in an English court by the British author [[David Irving]] in 1996, asserting that Lipstadt had libeled him in her book ''[[Denying the Holocaust]]''. The court ruled that the Irving's claim of libel relating to English defamation law and Holocaust denial was not valid because his deliberate distortion of evidence has been shown to be substantially true. English libel law puts the burden of proof on the defence, meaning that it was up to Lipstadt and her publisher to prove that her claims of Irving's deliberate misrepresentation of evidence to conform to his ideological viewpoints were substantially true. Lipstadt hired British-Jewish lawyer Anthony Julius while Penguin hired libel experts Kevin Bays and Mark Bateman of media law firm Davenport Lyons. Richard J. Evans, an established historian, was hired by the defence to serve as an expert witness. Evans spent two years examining Irving's work, and presented evidence of Irving's misrepresentations, including evidence that Irving had knowingly used forged documents as source material. Upon mutual agreement, the case was argued as a bench trial before Mr. Justice Charles Gray, who produced a written judgment 333 pages long in favour of the defendants, in which he detailed Irving's systematic distortion of the historical record of World War II.

;2000: During the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential election]], Lee Alcorn, president of the Dallas [[NAACP]] branch, criticized [[Al Gore]]'s selection of Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] for his Vice-Presidential candidate because Lieberman was Jewish. On a gospel talk radio show on station KHVN, Alcorn stated, "If we get a Jew person, then what I'm wondering is, I mean, what is this movement for, you know? Does it have anything to do with the failed peace talks?" ... "So I think we need to be very suspicious of any kind of partnerships between the Jews at that kind of level because we know that their interest primarily has to do with money and these kind of things."&lt;ref name=CBS1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/08/09/politics/main223114.shtml|date=9 August 2000|title=NAACP Leader Quits Under Fire|publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NAACP President [[Kweisi Mfume]] immediately suspended Alcorn and condemned his remarks. Mfume stated, "I strongly condemn those remarks. I find them to be repulsive, anti-Semitic, anti-NAACP and anti-American. Mr. Alcorn does not speak for the NAACP, its board, its staff or its membership. We are proud of our long-standing relationship with the [[American Jews|Jewish community]] and I personally will not tolerate statements that run counter to the history and beliefs of the NAACP in that regard."&lt;ref name=CBS1/&gt;

Alcorn, who had been suspended three times in the previous five years for misconduct, subsequently resigned from the NAACP and started his own organization called the Coalition for the Advancement of Civil Rights. Alcorn criticized the NAACP, saying, "I can't support the leadership of the NAACP. Large amounts of money are being given to them by large corporations that I have a problem with."&lt;ref name=CBS1/&gt; Alcorn also said, "I cannot be bought. For this reason I gladly offer my resignation and my membership to the NAACP because I cannot work under these constraints."&lt;ref name=CNN1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/08/09/lieberman.naacp/index.html|date=9 August 2000|title=Bush campaign denounces Dallas NAACP comments on Lieberman|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcorn's remarks were also condemned by the Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]], Jewish groups and George W. Bush's rival [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential campaign.

;2001 May 4: At the 17th meeting of the International Liaison Committee in [[New York City|New York]], Catholic Church officials state that they will change how Judaism is dealt with in Catholic seminaries and schools. In part, they state:

:The curricula of Catholic seminaries and schools of theology should reflect the central importance of the Church's new understanding of its relationship to Jews....Courses on Bible, developments by which both the Church and rabbinic Judaism emerged from early Judaism will establish a substantial foundation for ameliorating "the painful ignorance of the history and traditions of Judaism of which only negative aspects and often caricature seem to form part of the stock ideas of many Christians". (See notes on the [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/relations-jews-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_19820306_jews-judaism_en.html Correct Way to Present Jews and Judaism in Catholic Preaching and Catechesis], #27, 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/research/cjl/meta-elements/texts/cjrelations/resources/documents/catholic/Vatican_Notes.htm |title=Vatican Notes |publisher=Bc.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103113900/http://www.bc.edu/research/cjl/meta-elements/texts/cjrelations/resources/documents/catholic/Vatican_Notes.htm |archivedate=3 January 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

:...Courses dealing with the biblical, historical and theological aspects of relations between Jews and Christians should be an integral part of the seminary and theologate curriculum, and not merely electives. All who graduate from Catholic seminaries and theology schools should have studied the revolution in Catholic teaching on Jews and Judaism from ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' to the prayer of Pope John Paul II in Jerusalem at the Western Wall on 26 March 2000....For historic reasons, many Jews find it difficult to overcome generational memories of anti-Semitic oppression. Therefore: Lay and Religious Jewish leaders need to advocate and promote a program of education in our Jewish schools and seminaries – about the history of Catholic-Jewish relations and knowledge of Christianity and its relationship to Judaism....Encouragement of dialogue between the two faiths does involve recognition, understanding and respect for each other's beliefs, without having to accept them. It is particularly important that Jewish schools teach about the [[Second Vatican Council]], and subsequent documents and attitudinal changes that opened new perspectives and possibilities for both faiths.

;2004: The film ''[[The Passion of The Christ]]'' was released in 2004. Before the film was even released, there were prominent criticisms of perceived antisemitic content in the film. [[20th Century Fox]] told New York Assemblyman [[Dov Hikind]] they had passed on distributing the film in response to a protest outside the [[News Corporation]] building. Hikind warned other companies that "they should not distribute this film.

A joint committee of the Secretariat for Ecumenical and Inter-religious Affairs of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] and the Department of Inter-religious Affairs of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] obtained a version of the script before it was released in theaters. They released a statement, calling it &lt;blockquote&gt;one of the most troublesome texts, relative to anti-Semitic potential, that any of us had seen in twenty-five years. It must be emphasized that the main storyline presented Jesus as having been relentlessly pursued by an evil cabal of Jews, headed by the high priest [[Caiaphas]], who finally [[blackmail]]ed a weak-kneed [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] into putting Jesus to death. This is precisely the storyline that fueled centuries of anti-Semitism within Christian societies. This is also a storyline rejected by the Roman Catholic Church at [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] in its document ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', and by nearly all mainline Protestant churches in parallel documents. ... Unless this basic storyline has been altered by Mr. Gibson, a fringe Catholic who is building his own church in the Los Angeles area and who apparently accepts neither the teachings of Vatican II nor modern biblical scholarship, ''The Passion of the Christ'' retains a real potential for undermining the repudiation of classical Christian anti-Semitism by the churches in the last forty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pawlikowski|first=John T.|title=Christian Anti-Semitism: Past History, Present Challenges Reflections in Light of Mel Gibson's ''The Passion of the Christ''|journal=Journal of Religion and Film|date=February 2004|url=http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820085751/http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|archivedate=20 August 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ADL itself also released a statement about the yet-to-be-released film:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For filmmakers to do justice to the biblical accounts of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism.

In ''[[The Nation]]'', reviewer [[Katha Pollitt]] said: "Gibson has violated just about every precept of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops own 1988 'Criteria' for the portrayal of Jews in dramatizations of the Passion (no bloodthirsty Jews, no rabble, no use of Scripture that reinforces negative stereotypes of Jews, etc.) [...] The priests have big noses and gnarly faces, lumpish bodies, yellow teeth; [[Herod Antipas]] and his court are a bizarre collection of oily-haired, [[epicene]] perverts.

[[William Fulco]], S.J., of [[Loyola Marymount University]]—and the film's [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] dialogue translator—specifically disagreed with that assessment, and disagreed with concerns that the film accused the Jewish community of [[deicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wooden|first=Cindy|title= As filming ends, 'Passion' strikes some nerves|work=[[National Catholic Reporter]]|date=2 May 2003|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_26_39/ai_101680926|accessdate=2008-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One specific scene in the film perceived as an example of anti-Semitism was in the dialogue of Caiaphas, when he states "His blood [is] on us and on our children!", a quote historically interpreted by some as a curse taken upon by the Jewish people. Certain Jewish groups asked this be removed from the film. However, only the subtitles were removed; the original dialogue remains in the Hebrew soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vermes|first=Geza|title=Celluloid brutality|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=27 February 2003|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,4120,1157381,00.html|accessdate=2008-08-20|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about this scene, Gibson said: "I wanted it in. My brother said I was wimping out if I didn't include it. But, man, if I included that in there, they'd be coming after me at my house. They'd come to kill me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seethepassion.com/article.php?id=21|title=The Jesus War}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another interview when asked about the scene, he said, "It's one little passage, and I believe it, but I don't and never have believed it refers to Jews, and implicates them in any sort of curse. It's directed at all of us, all men who were there, and all that came after. His blood is on us, and that's what Jesus wanted. But I finally had to admit that one of the reasons I felt strongly about keeping it, aside from the fact it's true, is that I didn't want to let someone else dictate what could or couldn't be said."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mel Gibson and Other "Passion" Filmakers say the Movie was Guided by Faith|work=Detroit Free Press|author=Terry Lawson|date=17 February 2004}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the film's suggestion that the Temple's destruction was a direct result of the Jews' actions towards Jesus could also be interpreted as an offensive take on an event which Jewish tradition views as a tragedy, and which is still mourned by many Jews today on the fast day of [[Tisha B'Av]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Markoe|first=Lauren|title=Tisha B'Av 2013: A New Approach To A Solemn Jewish Holiday|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/15/tisha-bav-2013_n_3599134.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked by [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] if his movie would "upset Jews", Gibson responded, "It's not meant to. I think it's meant to just tell the truth. I want to be as truthful as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101030127-409570,00.html|title=The Passion of Mel Gibson|work=Time|date=19 January 2003|accessdate=2010-05-25|first=Richard|last=Corliss}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' newspaper, he added: "If anyone has distorted Gospel passages to rationalize cruelty towards Jews or anyone, it's in defiance of repeated Papal condemnation. The [[Papacy]] has condemned racism in any form. ... Jesus died for the sins of all times, and I'll be the first on the line for culpability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mel Gibson Interview|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=14 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative columnist [[Cal Thomas]] also disagreed with allegations of antisemitism, saying "To those in the Jewish community who worry that the film [...] might contain anti-Semitic elements, or encourage people to persecute Jews, fear not. The film does not indict Jews for the death of Jesus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/CalThomas/2003/08/05/the_greatest_story_ever_filmed|title=The Greatest Story Ever Filmed|publisher=TownHall.com|date=5 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[Orthodox Jew]]s, Rabbi Daniel Lapin and conservative talk-show host and author [[Michael Medved]], also vocally rejected claims that the film is anti-Semitic. They have noted the film's many sympathetic portrayals of Jews: [[Simon of Cyrene]] (who helps Jesus carry the cross), [[Mary Magdalene]], the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]], [[John the Evangelist|St. John]], [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]] (who wipes Jesus' face and offers him water) and several Jewish priests who protest Jesus' arrest ([[Nicodemus]] and [[Joseph of Arimathea]]) during [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Caiaphas' trial of Jesus]].

Bob Smithouser of Plugged in Online believed that film was trying to convey the evils and sins of humanity rather than specifically targeting Jews, stating: "The anthropomorphic portrayal of Satan as a player in these events brilliantly pulls the proceedings into the supernatural realm—a fact that should have quelled the much-publicized cries of anti-Semitism since it shows a diabolical force at work beyond any political and religious agendas of the Jews and Romans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pluggedin.com/videos/2005/q1/passionofthechrist.aspx|title=The Passion of the Christ|publisher=Pluggedin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Senior Vatican officer [[Darío Castrillón Hoyos|Cardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos]], who has seen the film, addressed the matter so:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Anti-Semitism, like all forms of racism, distorts the truth in order to put a whole race of people in a bad light. This film does nothing of the sort. It draws out from the historical objectivity of the Gospel narratives sentiments of forgiveness, mercy, and reconciliation. It captures the subtleties and the horror of sin, as well as the gentle power of love and forgiveness, without making or insinuating blanket condemnations against one group. This film expressed the exact opposite, that learning from the example of Christ, there should never be any more violence against any other human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gaspari|first=Antonio|title=The Cardinal &amp; the ''Passion''|work=[[National Review Online]]|date=September 18, 2003|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-gaspari091803.asp|accessdate=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jewish reactions to the motu proprio underlined their concern that the traditional formulation of the [[Good Friday prayer for the Jews]], which Jews felt offensive, would be more broadly used.

In the form in which they appear in the 1962 Missal, the set of prayers in which that of the Jews is included are for: the Holy Church, the Supreme Pontiff;  all orders and grades of the faithful (clergy and laity); public officials (added in 1955, replacing an older prayer for the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], not used since the abdication of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] in 1806 but still printed in the Roman Missal); catechumens; the needs of the faithful; heretics and schismatics; the conversion of the Jews (without the word "perfidis"); the conversion of pagans.

In later editions of the Missal, the prayers are for: the Church; the Pope, the clergy and laity of the Church; those preparing for baptism; the unity of Christians, the Jewish people; those who do not believe in Christ; those who do not believe in God; all in public office; those in special need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/calendar/day.cfm?date=2008-03-21|title=Good Friday – March 21, 2008 – Liturgical Calendar|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new prayer reads as follows:
:''Let us also pray for the Jews: That our God and Lord may illuminate their hearts, that they acknowledge Jesus Christ is the Savior of all men.''  (''Let us pray.'' ''Kneel.'' ''Rise.'') ''Almighty and eternal God, who want that all men be saved and come to the recognition of the truth, propitiously grant that even as the fullness of the peoples enters Thy Church, all Israel be saved. Through Christ Our Lord. Amen.''&lt;ref&gt;''Oremus et pro Iudaeis: Ut Deus et Dominus noster illuminet corda eorum, ut agnoscant Iesum Christum salvatorem omnium hominum.'' ''(Oremus.'' ''Flectamus genua.'' ''Levate.'') ''Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui vis ut omnes homines salvi fiant et ad agnitionem veritatis veniant, concede propitius, ut plenitudine gentium in Ecclesiam Tuam intrante omnis Israel salvus fiat. Per Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the new formulation met with reservations from groups such as the Anti-Defamation League. They considered the removal of "blindness" and "immersion in darkness" with respect to the Jews an improvement over the original language in the Tridentine Mass, but saw no reason why the prayer in the rite as revised by Paul VI was not used instead.

The '''Trudoviks''' ({{lang-ru|Трудова́я гру́ппа}}, ''Trudovaya gruppa''; literally "Labour Group") were a [[social-democratic]] [[Political parties in Russia|political party of Russia]] in early 20th century.

==History==
The Trudoviks were a breakaway of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]] faction as they defied the party's stance by standing in the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|First Duma]].&lt;ref name=socialist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUSsrp.htm|title=Party of Socialist Revolutionaries|accessdate=4 September 2008|publisher=Spartacus|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906012552/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUSsrp.htm|archivedate=26 September 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were founded and led by [[Aleksei Feodorovich Aladin|Aleksei Aladin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/search-resources/guide-to-special-collections/atoz/aladin-papers/|title=Brief biography of Aladin|publisher=[[University of Manchester Library]]|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a Russian soldier. He was elected to the First Duma in 1906 but spent his later years in exile in the United Kingdom.  Aladin was born in Simbirsk in 1873 to a peasant family and attended the same gymnasium as Lenin and Alexander Kerensky.

This [[Agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] party was one of hundreds of small workers' circles that sprang up around Russia in the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905 Revolution]]. While the revolution did not remove the [[Tsar]], it certainly curtailed his power—but not to the extent of the democratic, liberal society that the revolutionaries had hoped for—and as result the party remained small, though it survived.

The Trudoviks are best known for winning seats in the State Duma, a national assembly created by Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] in the aftermath of the 1905 Revolution. The seats they won were mainly in the 1st and 2nd assemblies in 1906 and 1907, when they gained over 100 seats.&lt;ref name=socialist/&gt; [[Alexander Kerensky]], later [[List of heads of government of Russia|Prime Minister of Russia]] under the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] in 1917, was elected to the Fourth Duma as a Trudovik in 1912.

==Work in the Second Duma ==
From January 1907, the labor group vigorously set about election campaigning. Almost everywhere, it sought to unite all the left elements, sometimes together with the Cadets. against the Right and Octobrists, sometimes without the Cadets. against them and the Rights. In St. Petersburg, the bloc of all the leftists with the Cadets failed, but a block of leftists took place without the Cadets. and without social-dem. "Mensheviks". In St. Petersburg, this bloc was defeated, but collected 27% of all the votes cast and held electors in one of the 12 parts of the city of St. Petersburg ( Vyborg ). In the first days of the second Duma 55 active members were registered in the labor group, except for 14 members of the peasant union who joined it, and 19 deputies who declared themselves "sympathetic to the labor group." February 15-17, 1907 in Terioki the second congress of the labor group was held, attended by 52 delegates from various departments.

At this congress it was decided that the working group would merge with the peasant union and be called the "labor group and peasant union", representing a unified parliamentary faction, with a single committee. The draft platform of the group was considered, but it was not finally approved and was recognized as acting temporarily, until the revision at the III Congress. The Central Committee of the group remained the same, from the labor group, and was conducted to the Presidium of the Duma, Comrade Chairman, M.E. Berezin . Among the visitors of the labor group meetings was another comrade of the chairman, HH Poznansky (but after he was elected to the chairman's comrades).

In the first days of the State, the Duma's working group introduced a draft amnesty for political criminals, which was somewhat modified by the previous year's edition.  The Duma group also introduced a draft of land reform, for which the group also took advantage of the previous year's project. Speakers of the labor group of the second Duma -- Berezin, Karavaev , Bulat , Tikhvinsky , Kartashev, and others -- stood out.

Almost always the labor group acted in the Duma together with the social-revolutionary. and bunk. socialists. It sought to create a permanent bloc of these three Duma factions and even merge them into one Duma faction, without destroying the party independence of each of them outside the Duma.

==Subsequent Duma ==
The labor group continued to exist only as a parliamentary faction. In the elections to the Third and Fourth Duma, the Trudoviks spoke out from a bloc of [[Narodnik]] organizations and left-wing forces that stood on the basis of radical democratic reforms. In the Third State Duma Trudoviks received 14 seats, in the 4th - 10 seats.

==Decay==
After the [[Third June coup d'état]], the work of the Trudoviks in the provinces ceased. After the February Revolution of 1917, they united with the people's socialists (unes) and formed the Labor People's Socialist Party at the Sixth Congress of the Trudoviks [June 17-23 (June 30-July 6)) 1917]. The party supported the Provisional Government, and after the October Revolution of 1917 took an anti-Bolshevik position and soon disintegrated.

'''''Vlaams Blok''''' ({{lang-en|Flemish Block}}, or VB) was the name of a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[far-right]] and [[secession]]ist political party with an anti-immigration platform.&lt;ref name=e05&gt;Erk, 2005, pp. 493-502.&lt;/ref&gt; Its ideologies embraced [[Flemish Movement|Flemish nationalism]], calling for the independence of [[Flanders]]. From its creation in 1978, it was the most notable militant right wing of the Flemish movement. ''Vlaams Blok'''s track record in the Flemish and Belgian parliament elections was strong. The election campaigns consisted mainly of the immigration and law-and-order theme, combined with the desire for Flemish autonomy.

All significant Flemish political parties were reluctant to enter coalitions with the ''Vlaams Blok''. Following a 1989 agreement, known as the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'', the party was effectively blocked from entering any level of government. The [[Court of Appeal (Belgium)|Court of Appeal]] in [[Ghent]] in April 2004 ruled that some of the party's organizations had breached the [[Belgian Anti-Racism Law|1981 anti-racism law]] and that the party sanctioned discrimination. The ruling was made definite on 9 November 2004, and the party shortly after reorganised itself as the ''[[Vlaams Belang]]''.&lt;ref name=e05/&gt; By 2004, the party had arguably become the single most popular Flemish party in Belgium, supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate,&lt;ref name=dw6&gt;De Winter, 2004, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being one of the most successful radical right-wing populist parties in Europe as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Coffé, 2005, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Background, Flemish Movement===
[[File:VlaamseStrijdvlag.svg|thumb|170px|The unofficial version of the [[Flag of Flanders]] associated with the Flemish Movement (not strictly the Vlaams Blok).]]
The ''Vlaams Blok'' originated from the loose [[Flemish Movement]], which historically has included an array of organisations seeking, to varying degrees, to promote [[Flanders]]. In the second half of the nineteenth century, Flemish nationalists operated within the established political parties, and had close ties with the political left.&lt;ref name=jimb&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VTdaIcZOkg0C&amp;dq|title=Ethnopolitics in the New Europe|first1=John T. |last1=Ishiyama|first2=Marijke |last2=Breuning|year=1998|publisher=Lynne Rienner|isbn=978-1-55587-610-4|pages=109–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early organised political expression of Flemish nationalism was triggered by [[World War I]], and the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] and [[proportional representation]] in elections.&lt;ref name=dw4/&gt; The main party that initially represented the movement was the left-wing nationalist [[Frontpartij|Front Party]], founded by former soldiers and sympathizers from the [[Western Front (World War I)|trench wars]] in [[Flanders Fields]] disaffected with their French-speaking, often anti-Flemish, officers that had been unable to communicate with their troops.&lt;ref name=jimb/&gt;&lt;ref name=dw4&gt;De Winter, 2004, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1930s, the main party became the [[Flemish National Union]] which turned to collaborate with the [[Nazi]]s during [[World War II]], as they had promised them increased Flemish autonomy.&lt;ref name=jimb/&gt;&lt;ref name=dw45/&gt; These circumstances would compromise the re-emergence of Flemish nationalism after the war, although only a faction of the broader movement had actually pursued an agenda of collaboration.&lt;ref name=dw45&gt;De Winter, 2004, pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct predecessor to the ''Vlaams Blok'' was the [[People's Union (Belgium)|People's Union]], which was founded in 1954 as the successor to the Christian Flemish People's Union electoral alliance, that had successfully run for election [[Belgian general election, 1954|earlier the same year]].&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The party had been careful to choose its leaders from nationalist circles that had not collaborated with the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;De Winter, 2004, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; While Flemish separatists had been suspicious of the People's Union since its outset, it became clear by the 1970s that the party had moved to a moderate left-liberal course, which led to the defection of its more radical members.&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, pp. 83-84.&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining nationalist hardliners finally rejected the party's participation in a new five-party government coalition in 1977, and particularly the [[Egmont pact]],&lt;ref name=dw2&gt;De Winter, 2004, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, pp. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; believing it had conceded too much to the francophone government parties.&lt;ref&gt;Coffé, 2005, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years (1978–1988)===
In late 1977, the rejection of the Egmont pact by the hardliner faction of the People's Union led to the establishment of two new (short-lived) parties; the radical nationalist Flemish National Party (VNP) and the national liberal Flemish People's Party (VVP), respectively led by [[Karel Dillen]] and Lode Claes.&lt;ref name=mud85&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wit&gt;{{cite book|last2=Craeybeckx|first2=Jan
|first1=Els|last1=Witte|title=Politieke geschiedenis van België sinds 1830 (Political History of Belgium Since 1830)|edition= 4|year=1985|publisher=Standaard Wetenschappelijke Uitgeverij|location=Antwerpen|language=Dutch|isbn=90-02-15260-4|page=556}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parties contested the [[Belgian general election, 1978|1978 general elections]] in a coalition called "Vlaams Blok", where they won 1.4% of the vote and one seat in the Chamber of Representatives (taken by Dillen).&lt;ref name=wit/&gt; On 28 May 1979, the VNP and VVP finally merged to form a new party named Vlaams Blok,&lt;ref name=mud87&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dillen was nominated to be the party's leader for life.&lt;ref name=dw15/&gt; The party initially recruited its members from Flemish nationalist organisations, such as the ''Taal Aktie Komitee'', ''[[Voorpost]]'', ''Were Di'', and the [[Order of Flemish Militants]], while some local groups also simply turned into local branches of the Vlaams Blok.&lt;ref name=mud87/&gt; In its inception, the party was widely regarded as a conservative separatist party, rather than an extreme right-wing party.&lt;ref name=dw6/&gt;

The party did not have much electoral success at first, and was stable at one seat in the [[Belgian general election, 1981|1981 general elections]]. It stood candidates in very few communities, and was active almost entirely in the city of [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref name=mud87/&gt; Having been founded mainly as a protest against the Egmont pact, the party revamped and broadened its platform after the pact collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, pp. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not make much progress in the [[Belgian general election, 1985|1985 general elections]], and Dillen thus started the so-called "Operation Rejuvenation", allowing for an across-the-board change of the party leadership, integrating many leaders of nationalist youth and student organisations into the party council. The party's youth organisation, the ''Vlaams Blok Jongeren'' (VBJ), was founded in 1987 by among others [[Filip Dewinter]] and [[Frank Vanhecke]].&lt;ref name=mud88&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1983, the Vlaams Blok increasingly began focusing on immigration (inspired by the success of other European right-wing populist parties), and on the international day against racism in 1984 held its first conference to discuss the "foreigner problem."&lt;ref name=mud88/&gt;&lt;ref name=c208&gt;Coffé, 2005, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Dillen proposed a bill in the Chamber of Representatives to offer cash incentive for immigrants to return to their native country.&lt;ref name=c208/&gt; In April 1987, a group around Roger Frankinouille of the only right-wing competitor to the Vlaams Blok, the anti-tax Respect for Labour and Democracy, switched to the party.&lt;ref name=mud88/&gt; The party campaigned for the [[Belgian general election, 1987|1987 general election]] with the slogan "Own people first" (''Eigen volk eerst!'', inspired by French [[National Front (France)|National Front]] slogan "The French first"), and saw a slight victory, winning their first seat in Senate (taken by Dillen), and for the first time two seats in the Chamber (Dewinter and [[Gerolf Annemans|Annemans]]).&lt;ref name=mud88/&gt;&lt;ref name=c209&gt;Coffé, 2005, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; The party's shift towards focusing on immigration was however criticised by some Vlaams Blok members, and ultimately also led to the defection of some top party figures. The party nevertheless made a clear choice of focussing on the immigration issue, which had, and would, give results in elections.&lt;ref name=c209/&gt;

===Rise of the party (1988–2004)===
[[File:Vlaams Blok Flag.png|thumb|right|Flag associated with the Vlaams Blok.]]
The electoral success of the Vlaams Blok began after the younger generation in the party shifted the party's emphasis from Flemish nationalism (separatism) to the [[immigration]] issue.&lt;ref name=dw13/&gt; In the 1988 local election in [[Antwerp]] the party first started to take off, going from 5.5% of the vote in the city to 17.7%,&lt;ref&gt;De Winter, 2004, pp. 2 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt; a success which drew much publicity.&lt;ref name=mud88/&gt; On 10 May 1989, based on the Antwerp success,&lt;ref name=c213&gt;Coffé, 2005, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; the presidents of all major Belgian parties (including the People's Union) signed a ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' (hygienic barrier), where the parties agreed to never conclude any political agreements with the Vlaams Blok, nor make immigration a political issue.&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Vlaams Blok itself also largely rejected cooperation with other parties, it did increasingly consider such cooperation, particularly in elections in 1994, 1999 and 2000, only to find themselves effectively blocked by the ''cordon sanitaire''.&lt;ref&gt;De Winter, 2004, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coffé, 2005, pp. 211-212.&lt;/ref&gt; Although intended to keep the Vlaams Blok from gaining political influence, many argued that the agreement in reality gave room for the strong electoral surge for the party, as it was made into what could be seen as the only "true opposition."&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; The agreement was renewed in following years,&lt;ref name=c213/&gt; and Vlaams Blok chairman Karel Dillen was used to call it the "insurance policy" of his party;&lt;ref&gt;Coffé, 2005, pp. 213-214.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"I was basically very happy with its existence. There was something a bit too much about it: everybody against us. If the sense is that there is a hunt out for us, then this will only drive people to take the side of the outlaw."}}
In December 1988, a major split occurred in the party, when a group who opposed the "Operation Rejuvenation" tried to squeeze the Dewinter-VBJ faction out of the party leadership. Led by Geert Wouters, he accused Dewinter's faction of being "[[Jean-Marie Le Pen|Lepenists]]", and of attempting to sideline the Flemish question to rather favour the immigration question. Dillen however sided with Dewinter, and Wouters and his group left the party and founded the nationalist pressure group called the Nationalist Association-Dutch People’s Movement.&lt;ref name=mud89&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the party won a seat in the [[Brussels]] city council, as well as in the European Parliament. There, the Vlaams Blok agreed to form a parliamentary group together with the French [[National Front (France)|National Front]] and the German [[The Republicans (Germany)|The Republicans]], called the [[European Right (1989–1994)|Technical Group of the European Right]]. The group lacked an ideological coherence (stemming in part from Le Pen's support for a Belgian state nationalism), and was largely organised on pragmatic grounds simply to get financial support.&lt;ref name=mud89/&gt;

In the [[Belgian general election, 1991#Chamber of Representatives|1991 general election]], the Vlaams Blok for the first time surpassed the People's Union, going from two to 12 seats in the Chamber, and from one to five seats in the Senate,&lt;ref&gt;De Winter, 2004, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; in what was afterwards referred to by its opponents as "Black Sunday".&lt;ref name=mud89/&gt; In the following years, the party saw a systematic upwards trend in all elections it participated in.&lt;ref name=dw6/&gt; In July 1992, the first Vlaams Blok motion was accepted in the Flemish Parliament, which rejected the right of francophone inhabitants in [[Flemish Brabant]] and [[Voeren]] to vote for [[Wallonia|Wallon]] institutions.&lt;ref name=mud90&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1992, it was announced that {{Not a typo|Staf}} Neel, a popular Antwerp city councillor for 22 years for the [[Socialistische Partij Anders|Socialist Party]] went over to the Vlaams Blok, thereby causing the SP and CVP to lose their majority in the city council.&lt;ref name=mud90/&gt; In 1992, the party ideologue [[Filip Dewinter]] and chairman Karel Dillen established the party's comprehensive immigration program, titled the [[70-point plan (Belgium)|70-point plan]].&lt;ref name=c209/&gt; The plan sought to close the borders towards non-European immigrants, gradually repatriate those already in the country, and implement an "own people first" principle in all policy areas.&lt;ref name=c209/&gt; Over the course of the 1990s, the party however increasingly distanced itself from the plan as it had alienated the party from gaining political influence, until it was finally officially discarded in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Coffé, 2005, pp. 209-210.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Frank Vanhecke.jpg|thumb|135px|Frank Vanhecke (seen in 2008) succeeded Karel Dillen as leader of the Vlaams Blok in 1996.]]

In the [[European Parliament election, 1994 (Belgium)#Dutch-speaking electoral college|1994 European election]], the party doubled its seats (Dillen and Vanhecke) with 12.6% of the vote, but failed to continue a European Right group, due to other nationalist parties having dropped out of the parliament, or refusing to join a group.&lt;ref name=mud90/&gt; National Front and Vlaams Blok MEPs nevertheless established an "alliance" called The Coordination of the European Right.&lt;ref&gt;Swyngedouw; Abts; Van Craaen, 2007, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, party leader Karel Dillen, who had been nominated to hold his position for life, stepped down and personally appointed [[Frank Vanhecke]] as his successor.&lt;ref name=dw15&gt;De Winter, 2004, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of Vanhecke was seen a compromise between the Flemish nationalist wing around Annemans and the Lepenist wing around Dewinter, thus avoiding a potential internal struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, elections were scheduled for the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (Belgium)#Dutch-speaking electoral college|European Parliament]], the [[Belgian general election, 1999|Chamber of Representatives and Senate]] and the [[Belgian regional elections, 1999#Flemish Parliament|Flemish Parliament]], where the Vlaams Blok overtook the position as the third largest Flemish party, winning more than 15% of the vote in all elections, and a total of 45 seats in the various parliaments.&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vlaams Blok continued to be particularly strong in and around Antwerp, where it received as much as 33% of the vote in the 2000 local elections.&lt;ref name=dw2/&gt; In 2001, the party was forced to alter its political program, as according to the laws for party financing, it was not compatible with the European Treaty on Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;Coffé, 2005, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Belgian regional elections, 2004#Flemish Parliament|2004 Flemish Parliament election]], the party finally became the single largest party group in parliament. The party was invited by the ''[[formateur]]'' for government discussions, only to find that its differences with the other parties was insurmountable, resulting in the three traditional parties forming a majority government, retaining the ''cordon sanitaire''.&lt;ref&gt;Coffé, 2005, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the party had nevertheless become the very most popular Flemish party in Belgium, being supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate.&lt;ref name=dw6/&gt;

=== Court of Cassation ruling (2004) ===
In October 2000, the [[Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism]], together with the [[Human Rights League (Dutch-speaking Belgium)|Dutch-speaking Human Rights League in Belgium]] registered a complaint at the Correctional Court, in which they claimed that three non-profit organisations connected to the Vlaams Blok (its education and research office and the "National Broadcasting Corporation") had violated the [[Belgian Anti-Racism Law|1981 anti-racism law]]. The publications which were referred to included its 1999 election agenda and 1997 party platform. The challenged passages included those where the party called for a separate education system for foreign children, a special tax for employers employing non-European foreigners, and a restriction of unemployment benefits and child allowances for non-European foreigners.&lt;ref name=c1415&gt;Coffé, 2005, pp. 214-215.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote = "Today, our party has been killed, not by the electorate but by the judges."|source=Frank Vanhecke, 9 November 2004.&lt;ref name=bbc2/&gt; |width  = 31% |align  = right}}
In June 2001, the Brussels Correctional Court declared itself incompetent to hear the case, as it related to political misconduct. In February 2003, the Brussels Appellate Court followed and gave a similar judgement. The original plaintiffs then appealed, and the case was sent to the Court of Appeals in [[Ghent]], which upheld the complaint; the Vlaams Blok non-profit organisations were fined, and it was deemed that the Vlaams Blok was an organisation that sanctioned discrimination. The Vlaams Blok lodged an appeal which was rejected, and in November 2004, the ruling was made definite, when it was upheld by the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]].&lt;ref name=c1415/&gt; The ruling meant that the party would lose access to state funding and access to television, effectively shutting the party down.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3994867.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|title=Court rules Vlaams Blok is racist|date=9 November 2004|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reactions====
The whole trial was seen by some as a political trial, inspired by the Belgian [[The Establishment|establishment]]. The federal parliament had notably amended the Constitution in order to create legal possibilities to condemn the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ideasinactiontv.com/tcs_daily/2004/11/belgians-waffle-a-ban-to-worry-about.html|title=Belgians Waffle? A Ban to Worry About| publisher=TCS Daily| date=22 November 2004|first=Michael|last=Totten}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vlaams Blok also pointed at the problem of political nomination of judges, and again claimed that the lawsuit had been a political process coordinated with the Belgian Ministry of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vlaamsbelang.org/1/2/ |title=Reacties over uitspraak Annemans zwaar overtrokken|work=Vlaams Belang|date=16 November 2004|accessdate=11 January 2011|language=Dutch|first=Joris|last=Van Hauthem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Frank|last=Vanhecke|url=http://www.vlaamsbelang.org/6/2|title=Niets veranderd!|work=Vlaams Belang|date=20 November 2004|accessdate=11 January 2011|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leadership of the Vlaams Blok seized the occasion of the ban to dissolve the party, and start afresh under a new name.&lt;ref&gt;Coffé, 2005, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, on 14 November, the Vlaams Blok disbanded itself, and a new party with the name ''[[Vlaams Belang]]'' was established. (Other proposed names included the Flemish People's Party and Flemish Freedom Front.)&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3995341.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|title=Blow to Belgium's far right|first=Angus|last=Roxburgh|location=[[Brussels]]|date=9 November 2004|accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new party instituted a number of changes in its political program, carefully moderating some of the more extreme positions of the former Vlaams Blok.&lt;ref&gt;Erk, 2005, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=l98&gt;Swyngedouw; Abts; Van Craaen, 2007, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the party leadership made it clear that the party would fundamentally remain the same.&lt;ref name=l98/&gt;

Professor Lamine ([[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|KUL]]), a former Vlaams Blok member and "advisor" of the party's legal team, claimed that the party, for [[propaganda]] reasons, purposely undertook a weak defence, in order to lose the case; "For the party leaders, losing was much more interesting. Winning just wasn't an option."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Eigen voetvolk bijlange niet meer eerst|work= [[De Morgen]]|date= 22 July 2006|page= 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamine himself had earlier stated that the party should have carried the trial to the [[European Court of Human Rights]], but Vlaams Blok senator [[Joris Van Hauthem]] had already stated in 2005, that; "If we had gone to Strasbourg [ECHR] based on procedural arguments, we might have had a case. But Lamine already put in a private claim to overturn the Appeals Court verdict, on the basis of substantive arguments. If ''Vlaams Belang'' were to put forth a claim against the verdict as well, at Strasbourg, the Court will bundle both cases. Then we would lose the case for sure. Lamine has thus given us the final blow&lt;!--Lamine heeft dus zichzelf en ons in de voet geschoten--&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vlaams Belang niet in beroep tegen veroordeling|location=[[Brussels]]|work=[[De Standaard]]|date=7 March 2005|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=GSFD350H|language=Dutch|accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology ==
The main ideological and political strategies of the Vlaams Blok started out with its radical nationalist rejection of the People's Union compromise on the Flemish autonomy issue, later to be followed by focus on [[immigration]] and [[Law and order (politics)|security]], exploitation of corruption and other scandals, and defense of traditional values. While the party was legitimized first and foremost by its defense of Flemish interests, its voters were mainly motivated by anti-immigration and anti-establishment protest.&lt;ref name=dw2/&gt;

===Flemish nationalism===
The main issue for the party was [[Flemish Movement|Flemish nationalism]], and most issues that were added later, were in some way also connected to this.&lt;ref name=dw1213&gt;De Winter, 2004, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Flemish nationalism promoted by the party (''volksnationalisme'') was according to its program "based on the ethnic community being a naturally occurring entity whose cultural, material, ethical and intellectual interests need to be preserved."&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; While the party primarily worked for an independent Flemish state (modeling the split on that of [[Czechoslovakia]]),&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; it for a long time also promoted the idea that the new state should merge with the [[Netherlands]], and establish a Dutch-speaking federation ([[Greater Netherlands]]). From the 1990s however, the latter idea was downplayed by the party, as the Netherlands then turned into a "permissive, multicultural and social-democratic state" according to one scholar (although this Dutch political situation would be sharply overturned in the 2000s).&lt;ref name=dw1213/&gt;

===Immigration, minorities===
[[Immigration]] became an important issue for the Vlaams Blok from the late 1980s. Interconnected with the Flemish nationalism issue, immigrants were considered to be a threat to the Flemish ethnic community. In 1992, the party established its [[70-point plan (Belgium)|70-point plan]], which included measures to stop all immigration, return most immigrants to their native countries by force, and legally discriminate against residing migrants in respect of markets such as labour, housing and education. The party's opponents particularly saw its immigration program as a source of claims of racism, and the party thus in its latest years downplayed the relevance of the 70-point plan, and softened its written positions regarding immigration.&lt;ref name=dw13&gt;De Winter, 2004, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about crime and security was also linked to immigration, as the party particularly blamed [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Moroccans]] for various criminal activity, and sought a [[zero tolerance]] approach regarding [[law and order (politics)|law and order]].&lt;ref name=dw13/&gt; The party was also strongly [[Criticism of Islam|anti-Islamic]] from early on, and in its 1993 program regarded [[Islam]] as "a doctrine, which preaches [[Jihad|holy war]], assassination, forced conversions, oppression of women, slavery and extermination of "infidels", [which] will automatically lead to what we now call fundamentalism."&lt;ref name=mud103&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The party was anti-Muslim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Radical right-wing populism in Western Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwTTwbtNyxUC&amp;pg=PA138 |page=138 |first=Hans-Georg |last=Betz |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Eur Sociol Rev |year=2009 |volume=25 |issue=4 |title=The Effects of Immigrant Population Size, Unemployment, and Individual Characteristics on Voting for the Vlaams Blok in Flanders 1991–1999 |url=http://esr.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/4/411.full |first=Nathalie |last=Rink |first2=Karen |last2=Phalet |first3=Marc |last3=Swyngedouw}}&lt;/ref&gt; and portrayed [[Muslim]]s as [[fifth column]] of a cruel and expansionist religion, and after the 1990 [[Gulf War]] called on the government to introduce measures to keep Belgium from being [[Islamisation|Islamised]].&lt;ref name=mud103/&gt;

The party was according to political scientist [[Cas Mudde]] only very rarely accused of [[anti-Semitism]] – and even then, it was strongly condemned by the party leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Roeland Raes]] cast doubt on the scale of the [[Holocaust]] in a television interview in 2001 for instance, the party leadership immediately called an emergency meeting, distanced itself from him and forced him to resign.&lt;ref name=da435/&gt; The party also took screening measures against its local candidates to reveal any possible extremist connections, and rather wanted to risk not being able to fill its lists, rather than filling them with extremists.&lt;ref name=da435/&gt; Particularly, the party wanted to distance itself from [[Holocaust denial]], as it actively sought to reach out to Jewish voters in [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref name=da435&gt;{{Cite journal|page=435|date=July 2008|first=David|last=Art|title=The Organizational Origins of the Contemporary Radical Right: The case of Belgium|journal=Comparative Politics|url=http://mwpweb.eu/1/31/resources/publication_238.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-establishment===
Another element in the ideology of the party was a [[populism|populist]] fight against the political establishment, often manifested through political scandals which flourished in 1990s Belgium; including [[corruption]], food and even [[pedophile]] scandals.&lt;ref name=dw13/&gt; These included the [[Agusta scandal]] and the [[Marc Dutroux]] affair.&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt; The usual suspects were politicians in the three traditional party families; especially the francophone parties.&lt;ref name=dw13/&gt;

===Economy===
The party had no strong economic preferences, and generally supported a [[mixed economy]]. While it supported [[privatisation]] and tax reductions for small and medium businesses, it also sometimes supported [[protectionism]] and defended the [[welfare state]], especially if allocated to the native Flemish population.&lt;ref name=dw14&gt;De Winter, 2004, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
The party was the only major Belgian party that opposed Belgium's membership of the [[European Union]], as well as the idea of a federal Europe itself. It however defended a con-federal Europe based on sovereign culturally homogeneous nation-states. The European issue was however not an issue the party promoted much.&lt;ref name=dw14/&gt;

It also favoured the abolition of the [[United Nations]], citing; "The illogical composition of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]. The unwieldy bureaucracy. The democratic deficit."&lt;ref name=l90&gt;Swyngedouw; Abts; Van Craaen, 2007, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The party did also not have any faith in such a world community or international legal system, questioning the entire logic behind the UN. It rejected the view of any international consensus about concepts as democracy, justice, freedom and human rights, especially since most of its member countries are non-Western and undemocratic.&lt;ref name=l90/&gt;

==International relations==
The ''Vlaams Blok'' maintained good contacts with nationalist parties throughout Europe and other countries. The ''Vlaams Blok'' did traditionally have the closest contacts with Dutch and South African far-right groups, including the Dutch [[Centre Party '86]], the [[Centre Democrats (Netherlands)|Centre Democrats]] and ''[[Voorpost]]'', and the South African [[Boerestaat Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, pp. 93 and 128.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1980s, it also established close relations particularly with the French [[National Front (France)|National Front]], as well as the [[German People's Union]], [[The Republicans (Germany)|The Republicans]] and [[National Democratic Party of Germany]].&lt;ref name=m93/&gt; In the 1990s, it supported the minor [[Dutch Block]] party, which had modeled itself directly on the ''Vlaams Blok''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2844/Archief/archief/article/detail/382167/1994/11/15/Van-CD-naar-Nederlands-Blok-en-soms-terug.dhtml|work=[[de Volkskrant]]|title=Van CD naar Nederlands Blok en soms terug|first=Hella|last=Rottenberg|date=15 November 1994|language=Dutch|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party also became very active in establishing contacts with post-communist parties in Eastern European countries, including the [[Croatian Party of Rights]], [[Slovak National Party]] and [[IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement]].&lt;ref name=m93/&gt; While not keeping official contacts, it was in addition very supportive of left-wing nationalist parties such as the [[Scottish National Party]], Irish [[Sinn Féin]] and Basque [[Herri Batasuna]]. Some of the parties it established contacts with most recently was the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] and the Italian [[Lega Nord]], which after a period of distrust, maintained contacts since 2002.&lt;ref name=m93&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swyngedouw; Abts; Van Craaen, 2007, pp. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election results==
Note that the election results in elections other than those for the [[Flemish Parliament]] (and the [[Dutch-speaking electoral college]] in the [[European Parliament]]) gives a somewhat wrong image of the party's support, given that the party only ran in [[Flanders]], the one half of [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=dw6/&gt;

Authorizes the Secretary to implement Project modifications that are described in the Plan and will produce a substantial benefit to the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem. Approves with limitations the [[Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge]] and the Southern Corkscrew Regional Ecosystem.

Prohibits any appropriation from being made for a Plan project until the President and the Governor of Florida enter into a binding agreement to ensure that water made available under the Plan is not otherwise used until sufficient reservations of water for the restoration of the natural system exist. Provides for enforcement of such requirement.

Requires the Secretary and the non-Federal sponsor to develop project implementation reports.

Prohibits Plan implementation from reducing current flood protection levels.

Directs the Secretary and Governor to develop an agreement for resolving disputes associated with Plan implementation.

Requires the Secretary, Secretary of the Interior, and Governor to establish an independent scientific review panel to review the Plan's progress toward achieving its natural system restoration goals. 

Requires the Secretary to report to Congress a determination as to whether the ongoing [[Biscayne Aquifer Storage and Recovery Program]] in Dade County, Florida, has a substantial benefit to the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem.

Expresses the sense of Congress that
* development at the site of the former Homestead Air Force Base could potentially cause significant air, water, and noise pollution and result in the degradation of adjacent national parks
* Federal agencies charged with determining the reuse of such site should carefully consider the environmental impacts of reuse options
* the redevelopment of such site should be consistent with South Florida ecosystem restoration goals
* the Secretary of the Air Force should take certain action so that reuse can proceed expeditiously
* after conveyance of surplus property, the Secretary should reuse such property in a manner consistent with the goals of the Plan; and (6) the Secretary should report to the appropriate congressional committees on actions taken.

[[File:Tov lenin ochishchaet.jpg|thumb|right|"Comrade Lenin Cleanses the Earth of Filth." (Mikhail Cheremnykh and  [[Viktor Deni]], 1920)]]
'''Who, whom?''' ({{lang-ru|кто кого?}}, ''Kto kogo?'') is a [[Bolshevism|Bolshevist]] principle or slogan which was formulated by [[Lenin]] in 1921.

Lenin is supposed to have stated at the second All-Russian Congress of Political Education Departments, on 17 October 1921, 
:{{lang|ru| Весь вопрос—кто кого опередит?}}
:"The whole question is—who will overtake whom?"

Leon Trotsky used the shortened "who whom" formulation in his 1925 article, "Towards Capitalism or Towards Socialism?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trotsky|first1=Leon|title=Towards Capitalism or Towards Socialism?|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1925/11/towards.htm|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shortened form  was invoked by [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1929, in a speech to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which also gave the formula its "aura of hard-line coercion" (while Lenin's phrase indicated a willingness to embrace economic competition)
:"The fact is, we live according to Lenin's formula: ''Kto–Kovo?'': will we knock them, the capitalists, flat and give them (as Lenin expresses it) the final, decisive battle, or will they knock us flat?"&lt;ref&gt;
Stalin, ''Sochineniia'', (Moscow: Izdatel'stvo politicheskoi literatury, 1947–52), vol. xii, p. 37, see also vol. xii, p. 144.
See "Soviet culture and foreign policy", Cambridge history of Russia, volume 3, p. 46.
"Stalin presented the mass collectivisation of 1929–30 as the triumphal outcome of Lenin's ''kto–kovo'' scenario. ''Kto–kovo'' acquired its aura of hard-line coercion from Stalin's use of it during this period: 'we live by the formula of Lenin – kto–kovo: will we knock them, the capitalists, flat and give them (as Lenin expresses it) the final, decisive battle, or will they knock us flat?' Yet Stalin's claim to embody the original spirit of kto–kovo contains some paradoxes. Lenin and the Bolshevik leaders who picked up on his phrase had used ''kto–kovo'' to justify an economic competition with the [[NEPman|Nepmen]] who dominated trade activities – a competition that would result in new forms of agricultural production only after an extremely high level of industrial technology was available. Stalin used ''kto–kovo'' to justify a policy of mass coercion against peasant kulaks to implement collective farms long before industry reached a high level."
&lt;/ref&gt;

It came to be used as a formula describing the inevitability of [[class struggle]], i.e. who (which of two antagonists) will dominate the other.
In this view, all compromises and promises between enemies are just expedients–tactical manoeuvres in the struggle for mastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ten Theories in Search of Reality: The Prediction of Soviet Behavior in the Social Sciences |author=Daniel Bell |journal=World Politics |volume=10 |number=3 |date=April 1958 |pages=327–365 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |jstor=2009491 |quote= Chapter: Kto-Kovo - The Id and Ego of Bolshevism |doi=10.2307/2009491}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Darko Suvin |title=Terms of power, today: an essay in political epistemology |journal=Critical Quarterly |volume=48 |issue=3 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8705.2006.00720.x |year=2006 |pages=38–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in government''' in the modern era are under-represented in most countries worldwide. Women have inadequate opportunities in social participation, especially in striving for political rights and power in the government and different institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Namibia|first=Sister|last2=Windhoek|date=1989|title=Women in government|url=https://search-proquest-com.easyaccess1.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/docview/194900864/fulltext/15F1461D90D946E1PQ/1?accountid=10371|journal=1(3)|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social status of women is relatively poor compared to men in different countries around the world, that contributes to generating the atmosphere of inferiority of women in the society.

However more and more women are pursuing leadership positions in the present day.

Women, as the conventional primary caretakers of children, often have a more prominent role than men in advocating for children, resulting in a "double dividend" in terms of the benefits of women's representation.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; Female representatives not only advance women's rights, but also advance the rights of children. In national legislatures, there is a notable trend of women advancing gender and family-friendly legislation. This advocacy has been seen in countries ranging from [[France]], [[Sweden]] and the [[Netherlands]], to [[South Africa]], [[Rwanda]], and [[Egypt]]. Furthermore, a number of studies from both industrialized and developed countries indicate that women in local government tend to advance social issues.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; In India, for instance, greater women's representation has corresponded with a more equitable distribution of community resources, including more gender-sensitive spending on programs related to health, nutrition, and education.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In 1954, the [[United Nations]] ''[[Convention on the Political Rights of Women]]'' went into force, enshrining women's equal rights to vote, hold office, and access public services as provided for male citizens within national laws.

== Worldwide status of women's representation in government ==
[[File:Prof. Dr. Lala Shevket, Leader of Azerbaijan Liberal Party.jpg|thumb|World's first female [[Secretary of State]] [[Lala Shevket]] at the office of [[Azerbaijan Liberal Party]]]]
As of October 25, 2013, the global average of women in national assemblies is 21.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Women in Parliaments: World and Regional Averages | url = http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm | website = ipu.org | publisher = [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] |accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, large differences exist between countries, e.g. Sri Lanka has quite low female participation rates in parliament compared with Denmark, Sweden and Norway, where female representation rates are among the highest.&lt;ref name="Carmichael" /&gt; Four of the top ten countries in 2017 were in South America (Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua and Mexico), and the Americas have seen the greatest aggregate change over the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apolitical.co/solution_article/which-countries-have-most-women-in-parliament/|title=Mapped: which countries have the most women in parliament|work=Apolitical|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New figures are available for up to February 2014 from International IDEA, Stockholm University and Inter-Parliamentary Union. (2014) at http://www.quotaproject.org/quotas.cfm

Although over 60% of countries have reached at least 10% women in their national legislature, far fewer have crossed the 20% and 30% barriers. By February 2006, only about 10% of sovereign nations had more than 30% women in [[parliament]].&lt;ref name="Paxton"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Paxton | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Melanie M. | last3 = Kunovich | first3 = Sheri L. | title = Gender in politics | journal = [[Annual Review of Sociology]] | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 263–284 | publisher = [[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Reviews]] | doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131651 | date = August 2007 | url = https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131651 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major English-speaking democracies are placed mostly in the top 40% of the ranked countries. New Zealand ranks at position 27 with women comprising 32.2% of its parliament. Australia (24.7% in the lower house, 38.2% in the upper house) and Canada (24.7% lower house, 37.9% upper house) rank at position 46 out of 189 countries. The United Kingdom is ranked at 58 (22.5% lower house, 22.6% upper house), while the United States ranks 78 (17.8% in the lower house, 20.0% in the upper house).&lt;ref name="Inter-Parliamentary Union" /&gt; It should be noted that not all of these lower and/or upper houses in national parliaments are democratically elected; for example, in Canada members of the upper house (the Senate) are appointed.

Paxton describes three factors that are the basis for why national level representation has become much larger over the past several decades. The first is the changing structural and economic conditions of nations, which says that educational advancements along with an increase in women's participation in the labor force encourages representation.&lt;ref name="Kunovich"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Paxton | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Kunovich | first2 = Sheri L. | title = Pathways to power: the role of political parties in women's national political representation | journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 111 | issue = 2 | pages = 505–552 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press|Chicago Journals]] | doi = 10.1086/444445 | jstor = 10.1086/ajs.2005.111.issue-2 | date = September 2005 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/444445 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second is the political factor; representation of women in office being based on a proportionality system. Some voting systems are built so that a party that gains 25% of the votes gains 25% of the seats. In these processes, a political party feels obligated to balance the representation within their votes between genders, increasing women's activity in political standing. A [[Plurality voting system|plurality-majority system]], such as the one the United States, United Kingdom, and India has, only allows single candidate elections, and thus allows political parties to entirely dictate regions' representatives even if they only control a small majority of the vote. Last, there is the ideological disposition of a country; the concept that the cultural aspects of women's roles or positions in the places they live dictate where they stand in that society, ultimately either helping or handicapping those women from entering political positions.&lt;ref name="Kunovich" /&gt;

==Pathways to political involvement==

Globally, there have been 4 general pathways that have lead women into political office:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Henderson |first1=Sarah L. |last2=Jeydel |first2=Alana S. |title=Women and Politics in a Global World |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=0199899665 |pages=20–21 |chapter=1. Women and International Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Political family - women in this path come from families that have a long history of in involvement in electoral politics.
* Surrogate - women in this path have assumed office, often temporarily, as a surrogate for a father, husband, or brother who has recently died.
* Party or political insider – women in this path start at the bottom of a party or political ladder and work their way up over time filling in necessary roles to show loyalty to the party.
* Political outsider – women in this path usually lack political experience but they run on a platform emphasizing new political changes and serve as an alternative to the status quo.

==Challenges faced by women==
Women face numerous obstacles in achieving representation in governance.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

=== Societal challenges ===
Gender inequality within families, inequitable [[division of labor]] within households, and cultural attitudes about [[gender roles]] further subjugate women and serve to limit their representation in public life.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;  Societies that are highly [[patriarchal]] often have local power structures that make it difficult for women to combat.&lt;ref name="Social Development 2005"&gt;{{citation | last = UNRISD | author-link = United Nations Research Institute for Social Development | contribution = Overview | editor-last = UNRISD | editor-link = United Nations Research Institute for Social Development | title = Gender equality: striving for justice in an unequal world | page = xxi | publisher = [[United Nations Research Institute for Social Development]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | year = 2006 | isbn = 9789290850731 | url = http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BCCF9/search/1FF4AC64C1894EAAC1256FA3005E7201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, their interests are often not represented or under-represented.

=== Systematic challenges ===
There have been many arguments saying the plurality-majority voting system is a disadvantage to the chance that women get into office. [[Andrew Reynolds (political scientist)|Andrew Reynolds]] brings forth one of these arguments by stating: "Plurality-majority single-member-district systems, whether of the Anglo-American [[first-past-the-post]] (FPTP) variety, the Australian preference ballot [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]] (AV), or the French [[two-round system]] (TRS), are deemed to be particularly unfavorable to women's chances of being elected to office".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt; [[Andrew Reynolds (political scientist)|Andrew]] believes that the best systems are [[List proportional representation|list-proportional systems]]. "In these systems of high proportionality between seats won and votes cast, small parties are able to gain representation and parties have an incentive to broaden their overall electoral appeal by making their candidate lists as diverse as possible".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;

Even once elected, women tend to hold lesser valued cabinet ministries or similar positions.&lt;ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003" /&gt; These are sometimes described as "soft industries" and include health, education, and welfare.  Far less often do women hold executive decision-making authority in more powerful domains or those that are associated with traditional notions of masculinity (such as finance and the military).  Typically, the more powerful the institution, the less likely it is that women's interests will be represented.  Additionally, in more autocratic nations, women are less likely to have their interests represented.&lt;ref name="Social Development 2005" /&gt; Many women attain political standing due to kinship ties, as they have male family members who are involved in politics.&lt;ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003" /&gt; These women tend to be from higher income, higher status families and thus may not be as focused on the issues faced by lower income families. In The United States, the lower end of the professional ladder contains a higher proportion of women while the upper level contains a higher proportion of men. Research shows that women are underrepresented in head positions in state agencies making up only 18% of congress and 15% of corporate board positions. When women do gain any level of representation it is in the fields of health, welfare, and labor. They are seen to be addressing issues labeled as feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Amy E.|last2=Monaghan|first2=Karen R.|date=2013-01-01|title=Some Ceilings Have More Cracks: Representative Bureaucracy in Federal Regulatory Agencies|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0275074011420997|journal=The American Review of Public Administration|language=en|volume=43|issue=1|pages=50–71|doi=10.1177/0275074011420997|issn=0275-0740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges of personal life and choices ===
Additionally, women running for public office typically gain additional, unnecessary scrutiny on their private lives.  For instance, fashion choices of politically active women are often picked apart by the media. In these "analyses" women rarely gain approval from those in the media, who usually say they either they show too much skin or too little, or perhaps that they either look too feminine or too masculine.  Sylvia Bashevkin also notes that their romantic lives are often subject of much interest to the general population, perhaps more so than their political agenda or stances on issues.&lt;ref name="Bashevkin 2009 86–89"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bashevkin | first = Sylvia | contribution = Vexatious Vixens | editor-last = Bashevkin | editor-first = Sylvia | title=Women, Power, Politics: The Hidden Story of Canada's Unfinished Democracy |year=2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|pages=86–89 | isbn = 9780195431704 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; She points out that those who "appear to be sexually active outside a monogamous heterosexual marriage run into particular difficulties, since they tend to be portrayed as vexatious vixens"&lt;ref name="Bashevkin 2009 88"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bashevkin | first = Sylvia | contribution = Vexatious Vixens | editor-last = Bashevkin | editor-first = Sylvia | title=Women, Power, Politics: The Hidden Story of Canada's Unfinished Democracy |year=2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|page=88 | isbn = 9780195431704 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are more interested in their private romantic lives than in their public responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Bashevkin 2009 86–89"/&gt;  If they are in a monogamous, married relationship but have children, then their fitness for office becomes a question of how they manage being a politician while taking care of their children, something that a male politician would rarely, if ever, be asked about.

===Challenges within political parties===
In Canada, there is evidence that female politicians face gender stigma from male members of the political parties to which they belong which can undermine the ability of women to reach or maintain leadership roles. [[Pauline Marois]], leader of the [[Parti Québécois]] (PQ) and the official opposition of the [[National Assembly of Quebec]], was the subject of a claim by Claude Pinard, a PQ "[[backbencher]]", that many Quebecers do not support a female politician: "I believe that one of her serious handicaps is the fact she's a woman [...] I sincerely believe that a good segment of the population won't support her because she's a woman".&lt;ref name="Banerjee"&gt;{{cite news|last=Banerjee|first=Sidhartha|title=PQ woes prompt debate in Quebec about whether women get a fair deal in politics|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/pq-woes-prompt-debate-in-quebec-about-whether-women-get-a-fair-deal-in-politics-1.720302|accessdate=November 2, 2011|work=[[The Canadian Press]]|date=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2000 study that analyzed 1993 election results in Canada found that among "similarly situated women and men candidates", women actually had a small vote advantage. The study showed that neither voter turnout nor urban/rural constituencies were factors that help or hurt a female candidate, but "office-holding experience in non-political organizations made a modest contribution to women's electoral advantage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Black | first1 = J.H. | last2 = Erickson | first2 = Lynda | title = Women candidates and voter bias: do women politicians need to be better? | journal = [[Electoral Studies]] | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 81–100 | publisher = [[ScienceDirect]] | doi = 10.1016/S0261-3794(01)00028-2 | date = March 2003 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/S0261-3794(01)00028-2 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce M. Hicks, an electoral studies researcher at Université de Montréal, states that evidence shows that female candidates begin with a head start in voters' eyes of as much as 10 per cent, and that female candidates are often more favorably associated by voters with issues like health care and education.&lt;ref name="Banerjee"/&gt; The electorate's perception that female candidates have more proficiency with traditional women's spheres such as education and health care presents a possibility that gender stereotypes can work in a female candidate's favor, at least among the electorate. In politics, however, Hicks points out that sexism is nothing new:
{{blockquote|(Marois' issue) does reflect what has been going on for some time now: women in positions of authority have problems in terms of the way they manage authority [...] The problem isn't them, it's the men under them who resent taking direction from strong women. And the backroom dirty dialogue can come into the public eye.&lt;ref name="Banerjee"/&gt;}}

Within Quebec itself, Don McPherson pointed out that Pinard himself has enjoyed greater electoral success with Pauline Marois as party leader than under a previous male party leader, when Pinard failed to be elected in his riding. Demographically, Pinard's electoral riding is rural, with "relatively older, less-well educated voters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McPherson|first=Don|title=Pauline Marois's troubles aren't because of sexism| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120107020557/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Pauline+Marois+troubles+aren+because+sexism/5648719/story.html | archive-date = January 7, 2012|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Pauline+Marois+troubles+aren+because+sexism/5648719/story.html|accessdate=November 13, 2011|work=[[Montreal Gazette]] | location = Canada|date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's suffrage movement==
[[File:Suffragette_parade._Grand_Marshall,_Mrs._Richard_Burleson;_Herald,_Miss_Inez_Milholland.jpg|thumb|left|Suffragette demonstration, 1913, Washington, D.C.]]
{{Main|Women's suffrage movement}}
[[Women's suffrage]] is the right of women to vote in elections. Most countries enacted women's suffrage in the first half of the 20th century. New Zealand was the first country to grant women the right to vote. On the 19th of September in 1893, New Zealand became the first country that allowed women the right to participate in elections. The change in the law was a result of a petition headed by Kate Shepherd on behalf of the Women's Temperance Union. The petition was signed by 32000 women, almost one in four of New Zealand women at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/voting-rights/page-4|title=4.  – Voting rights – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the last countries to enact it were [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]]. In Switzerland, women gained the [[Women's suffrage in Switzerland|right to vote]] in federal [[Elections in Switzerland|elections]] in 1971;&lt;ref name="switzerland-chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology |website=history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch | publisher = History of Switzerland |accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm |title= Experts in women's anti-discrimination committee raise questions concerning reports of Switzerland on compliance with convention | date = 14 January 2003 |website=un.org | publisher = [[United Nations]] |accessdate=September 2, 2011}} Press release: Meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).&lt;/ref&gt; In Liechtenstein, women were given the right to vote by the [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984|women's suffrage referendum of 1984]].

==Mirror representation==

Women's participation in formal politics is lower than men's throughout the world.&lt;ref name=NandW1&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = The women's movement in Canada | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 88 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The argument put forth by scholars Jacquetta Newman and Linda White is that women's participation in the realm of high politics is crucial if the goal is to affect the quality of public policy. As such, the concept of ''mirror representation'' aims to achieve gender parity in public office. In other words, mirror representation says that the proportion of women in leadership should match the proportion of women in the population that they govern. Mirror representation is premised on the assumption that elected officials of a particular gender would likely support policies that seek to benefit constituents of the same gender.

=== Effects of mirror representation on public policy ===
A key critique is that mirror representation assumes that all members of a particular sex operate under the rubric of a shared identity, without taking into consideration other factors such as age, education, culture, or socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name="Pitkin 1967 61"&gt;{{Citation | last = Pitkin | first = Hannah F. | contribution = Formalistic views of representation | editor-last = Pitkin | editor-first = Hannah F. | title=The concept of representation |year=1967|publisher= University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|page=61 | isbn = 9780520021563 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, proponents of mirror representation argue that women have a different relationship with government institutions and public policy than that of men, and therefore merit equal representation on this facet alone. This feature is based on the historical reality that women, regardless of background, have largely been excluded from influential legislative and leadership positions. As Sylvia Bashevkin notes, "representative democracy seems impaired, partial, and unjust when women, as a majority of citizens, fail to see themselves reflected in the leadership of their polity."&lt;ref name="Bashevkin 2009 15"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bashevkin | first = Sylvia | contribution = Introduction | editor-last = Bashevkin | editor-first = Sylvia | title=Women, power, politics: the hidden story of Canada's unfinished democracy |year=2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|page=15 | isbn = 9780195431704 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the issue of participation of Women in politics is of such importance that the United Nations has identified gender equality in representation (i.e. mirror representation) as a goal in the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)]] and the [[Fourth World Conference on Women#Beijing Platform for Action|Beijing Platform for Action]].&lt;ref name="NandW2"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = The women's movement in Canada | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 89 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides seeking equality, the goal of mirror representation is also to recognize the significance of women's involvement in politics, which subsequently legitimizes said involvement.

There have been differing results between studies that looked at the significance of women's representation on actual policy outcomes. Though women in the United States are more likely to identify as feminists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/feminism-project/poll/|title=What Americans think about feminism today|last=Cai|first=Weiyi|date=January 27, 2016|access-date=November 11, 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2014 study looking in the United States finds "no effect of gender of the mayor on policy outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferreira | first1 = Fernando | last2 = Gyourko | first2 = Joseph | title = Does gender matter for political leadership?

===Social and cultural barriers to mirror representation===
Mirror representation stems from the barriers female political candidates often face, these include: sex stereotyping, political socialization, lack of preparation for political activity, and balancing work and family. In the media, women are often asked how they would balance the responsibilities of elected office with those to their families, something men are never asked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Beaudoux García | first = Virginia | title = Five ways the media hurts female politicians — and how journalists everywhere can do better | url = https://theconversation.com/five-ways-the-media-hurts-female-politicians-and-how-journalists-everywhere-can-do-better-70771 | work = [[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | date = January 18, 2017 | access-date = January 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sex stereotyping'''. Sex stereotyping assumes that masculine and feminine traits are intertwined with leadership. Hence, the bias leveled against women stems from the perception that femininity inherently produces weak leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kittilson | first1 = Miki C. | last2 = Fridkin | first2 = Kim | title = Gender, candidate portrayals and election campaigns: a comparative perspective | journal = [[Politics and Gender]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | page = 373 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S1743923X08000330 | date = September 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.1017/S1743923X08000330 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the aggressive and competitive nature of politics, many insist that participation in elected office requires masculine traits.&lt;ref name="MacIvor 1996 240"&gt;{{Citation | last = MacIvor | first = Heather | contribution = Women's participation in politics | editor-last = MacIvor | editor-first = Heather | title=Women and politics in Canada: an introductory text |year=1996|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Peterborough, Ontario|page=242 | isbn = 9781551110363 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sex stereotyping is far from being a historical narrative. The pressure is on female candidates (and not male ones) to enhance their masculine traits in order to garner support from voters who identify with socially constructed gender roles.{{citation needed|reason=the claim that women in politics are pressured to conform to masculine roles is one that should be supported with research|date=February 2016}}

'''Political socialization'''. Political socialization is the idea that, during childhood, people are indoctrinated into socially constructed norms of politics. In the case of women's representation in government, it says that sex stereotyping begins at an early age and affects the public's disposition on which genders are fit for public office. Socialization agents can include family, school, higher education, mass media, and religion.&lt;ref name="NandW3"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = Women's participation in formal politics | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 99 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these agents plays a pivotal role in either fostering a desire to enter politics, or dissuading one to do so.

Generally, girls tend to see politics as a "male domain".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gidengil | first1 = Elisabeth | last2 = O'Neill | first2 = Brenda | last3 = Young | first3 = Lisa | title = Her mother's daughter?

Women running for U.S senate are often underrepresented in news coverage. The way male and females are depicted in media has an effect of how female's candidates gets elected in to public office. Female candidates get treated differently in the media then their male counterparts in the U.S senate elections, Women receive less news coverage also the coverage they do receive concentrates more on their viability and less on their issue positions, causes female candidates to be overlooked and underrated during elections, which is an obstacle for women running for U.S senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahn|first=Kim Fridkin|last2=Goldenberg|first2=Edie N.|date=1991-01-01|title=WOMEN CANDIDATES IN THE NEWS: AN EXAMINATION OF GENDER DIFFERENCES IN U.S. SENATE CAMPAIGN COVERAGE|url=https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/55/2/180/1810869|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|language=en|volume=55|issue=2|pages=180–199|doi=10.1086/269251|issn=0033-362X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lack of preparation for political activity'''. An aftereffect of political socialization is that it determines how inclined women are to pursue careers that may be compatible with formal politics. Careers in law, business, education, and government, professions in which women happen to be minorities, are common occupations for those that later decide to enter public office.&lt;ref name=NandW4 /&gt;

'''Balancing work and family'''. The work life balance is invariably more difficult for women, because they are generally expected by society to act as the primary caregivers for children and maintainers of the home. Due to these demands, it is assumed that women would choose to delay political aspirations until their children are older. Also, a women's desire for a career in politics along with the extent that the respondent feels her family duties might inhibit her ability to be an elected official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elder|first1=Laurel|title=Why Women Don't Run|journal=Women &amp; Politics|date=21 September 2004|volume=26|issue=2|pages=27–56|doi=10.1300/J014v26n02_02|issn=0195-7732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that new female politicians in Canada and the U.S. are older than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=NandW5&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = Women's participation in formal politics | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 102 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a woman may be pushed to remain childless in order to seek political office.

Institutional barriers may also pose as a hindrance for balancing a political career and family. For instance, in Canada, Members of Parliament do not contribute to Employment Insurance; therefore, they are not entitled to paternity benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parliament of Canada|title=40th Parliament, 3rd  Session|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=4694765#TOC-TS-1150|work=October 18, 2010|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Such lack of parental leave would undoubtedly be a reason for women to delay seeking electoral office. Furthermore, mobility plays a crucial role in the work-family dynamic. Elected officials are usually required to commute long distances to and from their respective capital cities, which can be a deterrent for women seeking political office.

==Policies to increase women's participation==
The United Nations has identified six avenues by which female participation in politics and government may be strengthened. These avenues are: equalization of educational opportunities, quotas for female participation in governing bodies, legislative reform to increase focus on issues concerning women and children, financing gender-responsive budgets to equally take into account the needs of men and women, increasing the presence of sex-disaggregated statistics in national research/data, and furthering the presence and agency of grassroots women's [[empowerment]] movements.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

===Education===
Women with formal education (at any level) are more likely to delay marriage and subsequent childbirth, be better informed about infant and child nutrition, and ensure childhood immunization. Children of mothers with formal education are better nourished and have higher survival rates.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; Education is a vital tool for any person in society to better themselves in their career path, and equalization of educational opportunities for boys and girls may take the form of several initiatives:

* abolishment of educational fees which would require parents to consider financial issues when deciding which of their children to educate. Poor children in rural areas are particularly affected by inequality resulting from educational fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = United Nations Children's Fund | last2 = World Bank | title = Building on what we know and defining sustained support | url = https://www.unicef.org/media/files/NAIROBI_AGENDA.pdf }} School Fee Abolition Initiative Workshop, organized by UNICEF and the World Bank, Nairobi, 5–7 April 2006, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* encouragement of parents and communities to institute gender-equal educational agendas. Perceived [[opportunity cost]] of educating girls may be addressed through a [[conditional cash transfer]] program which financially reward families who educate their daughters (thus removing the financial barrier that results from girls substituting school attendance for work in the family labor force).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bellamy | first = Carol | title = The state of the world's children, 2004: Girls' education And development | publisher = UNICEF | location = New York | year = 2003 | url = https://www.unicef.org/publications/index_18108.html | isbn = 9780756740214 }} [https://www.unicef.org/sowc04/files/SOWC_O4_eng.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*creation of "girl-friendly" schools to minimize bias and create a safe school environment for girls and young women. Currently, a barrier to female school attendance is the risk of [[sexual violence]] en route to school.&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"&gt;United Nations Children's Fund, The State of the World's Children 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; A "safe school environment" is one in which the school is located to minimize such violence, in addition to providing girls with educational opportunities (as opposed to using female students to perform janitorial work or other menial labor).&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"/&gt;

Jones, in reference to [[Pippa Norris|Norris's]] ''Legislative Recruitment'', states that: "Unlike other factors that have been identified as influencing the level of women's legislative representation, such as a country's political culture and level of economic development, institutional rules are relatively easy to change".&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jones | first = Mark P. | title = Gender quotas, electoral laws, and the election of women: lessons from the Argentine provinces | journal = [[Comparative Political Studies]] | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–21 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0010414098031001001 | date = February 1998 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414098031001001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article about the exclusion of Women from politics in southern Africa, Amanda Gouws said "The biggest hurdles to overcome for women are still on the local level where both men and women are often recruited from the communities and have limited political skills".&lt;ref name="Amanda"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gouws | first = Amanda | title = Changing women's exclusion from politics: examples from Southern Africa | journal = [[African and Asian Studies]] | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 537–563 | publisher = [[Brill Publishers]] | doi = 10.1163/156921008X359650 | date = 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.1163/156921008X359650 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of education in these local governments or, for that matter, the people in those positions of power, are substandard.

One example of the hurdles women face in receiving good education comes from Beijing. "Most women who attended the [[NGO]] Forums accompanying the [[UN]] conferences, which are for government delegations (though increasingly many governments include activists and [[NGO]] members among their official delegates), were middle-class educated women from [[INGO|INGOS]], donors, academics, and activists".&lt;ref name="Manisha"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Desai | first = Manisha | title = Transnationalism: the face of feminist politics post-Beijing | journal = International Social Science Journal | volume = 57 | issue = 184 | pages = 319–330 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2451.2005.553.x | date = June 2005 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2451.2005.553.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lydia Kompe, a well-known South African activist, was one of these rural women. She noted that she felt overwhelmed and completely disempowered. In the beginning, she did not think she could finish her term of office because of her lack of education.&lt;ref name="Amanda" /&gt; Manisha Desai explains that: "There is an inequality simply around the fact that the [[UN]] system and its locations say a lot about the current focus of those systems, such positions being in the US and Western Europe allow easier access to those women in the area.&lt;ref name="Manisha" /&gt; It is also important to note that institutions affect the cultural propensity to elect women candidates in different ways in different parts of the world."&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;

The study of the history of women's representation has been a major contribution in helping scholars view such concepts. [[Andrew Reynolds (political scientist)|Andrew Reynolds]] states: "historical experience often leads to gender advancement, and political liberalization enables women to mobilize within the public sphere".&lt;ref name="Andrew"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Reynolds | first = Andrew | author-link = Andrew Reynolds (political scientist) | title = Women in the legislatures and executives of the world: knocking at the highest glass ceiling | journal = [[World Politics]] | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 547–572 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S0043887100009254 | date = July 1999 | url = https://doi.org/10.1017/S0043887100009254 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that we will see a larger number of women in higher office positions in established democracy than in democracies that are developing, and "the more illiberal a state is, the fewer women will be in positions of power".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;  As countries open education systems to women, and more women participate in historically male dominated fields, it is possible to see a shift in political views regarding women in government.

===Quotas===
{{further2|[[All-women shortlists]], a UK policy for electoral gender-parity}}

[[File:TRS ballot papers.svg|thumb|Example of a TRS ballot papers]]
Quotas are explicit requirements on the number of women in political positions.&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"/&gt; "Gender quotas for the election of legislators have been used since the late 1970s by a few political parties (via the party charter) in a small number of advanced industrial democracies; such examples would be like [[Germany]] and [[Norway]]".&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; [[Andrew Reynolds (political scientist)|Andrew Reynolds]] says there is "an increasing practice in legislatures for the state, or the parties themselves, to utilize formal or informal quota mechanisms to promote women as candidates and [[Member of Parliament|MPs]]".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;  The statistics surrounding quota systems have been examined thoroughly by academia.

Types of quotas include:&lt;ref name="Fund 2004" /&gt;
* Sex quota systems: institute a "critical value" below which is deemed an imbalanced government. Examples of such critical values include 20% of legislators, 50%{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} of politicians, etc.
* Legal quota systems regulate the governance of political parties and bodies. Such quotas may be mandated by electoral law (as the [[Argentine quota law]], for example) or may be constitutionally required (as in Nepal).
* Voluntary party quota systems may be used by [[political parties]] at will, yet are not mandated by electoral law or by a country's constitution. If a country's leading or majority political party engages in a voluntary party quota system, the effect may "trickle down" to minority political parties in the country (as in the case of the African National Congress in South Africa).
Quotas may be utilized during different stages of the political nomination/selection process to address different junctures at which women may be inherently disadvantaged:&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"/&gt;
* Potential candidacy: sex quota systems can mandate that from the pool of aspirants, a certain percentage of them must be female.
* Nomination: legal or voluntary quotas are enforced upon this stage, during which a certain portion of nominated candidates on the party's ballot must be female.
* Election: "reserved seats" may be filled only by women.
Quota usage can have marked effects on female representation in governance. In 1995, Rwanda ranked 24th in terms of female representation, and jumped to 1st in 2003 after quotas were introduced. Similar effects can be seen in Argentina, Iraq, Burundi, Mozambique, and South Africa, for example.&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"/&gt; Of the top-ranked 20 countries in terms of female representation in government, 17 of these countries utilize some sort of quota system to ensure female inclusion. Though such inclusion is mainly instituted at the national level, there have been efforts in India to addresses female inclusion at the subnational level, through quotas for parliamentary positions.&lt;ref name="IPU_class"&gt;''See'':
* {{cite web | title = Women in Parliaments: World classification | url = http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm | website = ipu.org | publisher = [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] }}
* and {{cite web | title = Global Database of Quotas for Women: Country overview | url = http://www.quotaproject.org/country.cfm?SortOrder=LastLowerPercenta | website = quotaproject.org | publisher = [[International IDEA]], [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] and [[Stockholm University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With quotas drastically changing the number of female representatives in political power, a bigger picture unravels. Though countries are entitled to regulate their own laws, the quota system helps explain social and cultural institutions and their understandings and overall view of women in general. "At first glance, these shifts seem to coincide with the adoption of candidate gender quotas around the globe as quotas have appeared in countries in all major world regions with a broad range of institutional, social, economic and cultural characteristics".&lt;ref name="6Krook"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Krook | first = Mona Lena | title = Reforming representation: the diffusion of candidate gender quotas worldwide | journal = [[Politics &amp; Gender]] | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–327 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S1743923X06060107 | date = September 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1743923X06060107 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quotas have been quite useful in allowing women to gain support and opportunities when attempting to achieve seats of power, but some see this as a wrongdoing. [[Drude Dahlerup]] and Lenita Freidenvall argue this in their article "Quotas as a 'Fast Track' to Equal Representation for Women" by stating: "From a liberal perspective, quotas as a specific group right conflict with the principle of equal opportunity for all. Explicitly favoring certain groups of citizens, i.e. women, means that not all citizens (men) are given an equal chance to attain a political career".&lt;ref name=5Dahlerup&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dahlerup | first1 = Drude | last2 = Freidenvall | first2 = Lenita | title = Quotas as a "fast track"  to equal political representation for women: why Scandinavia is no longer the model | journal = [[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–48 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/1461674042000324673 | date = 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1461674042000324673 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahlerup and Freidenvall claim that even though quotas create theoretical imbalance in opportunity for men and that they necessarily break the concept of "classical liberal notion of equality",&lt;ref name="5Dahlerup" /&gt; quotas are almost required to bring the relation of women in politics to a higher state, whether that is through equal opportunity or just equal results.&lt;ref name="5Dahlerup" /&gt; "According to this understanding of women's under-representation, mandated quotas for the recruitment and election of female candidates, possibly also including time-limit provisions, are needed".&lt;ref name="5Dahlerup" /&gt;

The introduction of gender quotas in the electoral process has spurred controversy from male politicians, resulting in resistance to the acceptance of quotas in the political realm.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;Krook, Mona. “Contesting gender quotas: dynamics of resistance.” Politics, Groups, and Identities, vol. 4, no. 2, 2016. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21565503.2016.1151797?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true. Accessed 25 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The mobilization of women in politics has been hindered by means of preserving male political survival, and to avoid political interference with male power and domination.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; Moreover, the implementation of gender quotas has caused the male candidate population to decrease in order for their female counterparts to participate, and this is commonly referred to as the “negative sum,” and this can result in a more qualified male being rejected to allow a female politician to participate.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; Furthermore, in the case of Argentina, which is currently mandated for a 30% female party at each level of government, saw the introduction of the 'quota women'; females that were less experienced, and only elected due to the legal requirement of quotas.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"&gt;Franceschet, Susan, and Jennifer M. Piscopo. “Gender Quotas and Women's Substantive Representation: Lessons from Argentina.” Politics &amp;Amp; Gender, vol. 4, no. 3, 2008, pp. 393–425., doi:10.1017/S1743923X08000342.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the 'quota women' has triggered what political scientists refer to as a 'mandate effect,' where quota women feel obligated to represent solely the interests of the female public.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Moreover, in order to preserve male political survival, “domination techniques” have been utilized to both exclude and delegitimize female representation in politics, and this can be depicted in the case of Argentina, where it took several elections to gain 35% of female representatives.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; With the increase of female representation in Argentina, issues that were rarely discussed before became paramount in debates, such as “penal laws, sexual assault laws, and laws on maternity leave and pregnancy… sexual education, [and] emergency contraceptive.”

Substantive representation contains two distinct parts: both the process and outcome of having female politicians.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Substantive representation based on the process is concerned with the gendered perspective, themes that female representatives discuss in political debates, and the impact they have on the creation of bills.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Likewise, this process also includes the networking between women in government and female organizations.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Substantive representation by outcome relates to the success of passing legislation that enables gender equality to both public and private issues.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Moreover, substantive representation as process does not always result in substantive representation by outcome; the implementation of gender quotas and female representation does not directly instigate an influx in legislation.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt;

Critical mass theory has correlations with both substantive representation as process and substantive representation as outcome. Critical mass theory suggests that once a certain percentage of women representatives has been reached, that female legislators will be able to create and enable transformative policies, and this has the potential to place pressure on quota women to act on behalf of all women.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; One paramount criticism of critical mass theory is its attention to numbers, and the understanding that quota women are to represent women collectively.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Furthermore, the representation of women as a collective group remains controversial, as “[if] she is a white straight, middle-class mother, she cannot speak for African-American women, or poor women, or lesbian women on the basis of her own experience anymore than men can speak for women merely on the basis of theirs.”&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt;

A 2018 study in ''[[The Journal of Politics]]'' found that the implementation of electoral gender quotas which substantially increased women's representation in parliament led to increased government expenditures toward public health and relative decreases in military spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clayton|first=Amanda|last2=Zetterberg|first2=Pär|date=2018-05-10|title=Quota Shocks: Electoral Gender Quotas and Government Spending Priorities Worldwide|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/697251|journal=The Journal of Politics|language=en|pages=000–000|doi=10.1086/697251|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
There have been numerous occasions where equal legislation has benefited the overall progression of women equality on a global scale. Though women have entered legislation, the overall representation within higher ranks of government is not being established. "Looking at ministerial positions broken down by portfolio allocation, one sees a worldwide tendency to place women in the softer [[sociocultural]] ministerial positions rather than in the harder and politically more prestigious positions of economic planning, national security, and foreign affairs, which are often seen as stepping-stones to national leader ship".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;

Legislative agendas, some pushed by female political figures, may focus on several key issues to address ongoing gender disparities:
* Reducing domestic and gender-based violence. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, published by the United Nations in 1989, addressed home violence and its effects on children. The Convention stipulates that children are holders of human rights, and authorizes the State to 1) prevent all forms of violence, and 2) respond to past violence effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = United Nations | title = Report of the independent expert for the United Nations study on violence against children – UN A/61/150 and Corr. 1 (provisional version) | url = https://disarmament-library.un.org/UNODA/Library.nsf/f860ad0cf3d61a518525711f006bb390/bba1dc9d335cbb1d852571b5005188c7/$FILE/agenda61.150.pdf | publisher = United Nations | location = New York | date = 23 August 2005 }}

It calls for "all parties of armed conflict to take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = United Nations | title =  Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000), para. 10, adopted by the Security Council at its 4213th meeting | url = https://www.un.org/press/en/2000/20001031.sc6942.doc.html | publisher = United Nations | location = New York | date = 31 October 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Reducing in-home discrimination through equalizing [[property]] and [[inheritance]]  rights. National legislation can supersede traditionally male-dominated inheritance models. Such legislation has been proven effective in countries like Colombia, where 60% of land is held in joint titles between men and women (compared to 18% before the passage of joint titling legislation in 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mason | first1 = Andrew D. | last2 = King | first2 = Elizabeth M. | contribution = Social norms, laws, and economic institutions: rights and laws (land rights) | editor-last1 = Mason | editor-first1 = Andrew D. | editor-last2 = King | editor-first2 = Elizabeth M. | title = Engendering development through gender equality in rights, resources, and voice: A World Bank policy research report | url = http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/512911468327401785/Engendering-development-through-gender-equality-in-rights-resources-and-voice | page = 120 | publisher = World Bank and Oxford University Press | location = Washington DC | date = January 2001 | isbn = 9780195215960 }} [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PGLP/Resources/Engendering_Development.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financing===
Sex-responsive budgets address the needs and interests of different individuals and social groups, maintaining awareness of sexual equality issues within the formation of policies and budgets. Such budgets are not necessarily a 50–50 male-female split, but accurately reflect the needs of each sex (such as increased allocation for women's reproductive health.&lt;ref name="United Nations Development Programme 2005"&gt;{{cite web | last =United Nations | title = Gender-responsive budgeting: manual for trainers | url = http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/povertyreduction/focus_areas/focus_gender_and_poverty/gender-responsiveplanningandbudgeting.html | publisher = United Nations Development Programme | location = Bratislava | year = 2005 }} [https://www.ndi.org/sites/default/files/Gender%20Responsive%20Budgeting%20Trainers%20Manual.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits of gender-responsive budgets include:
* Improved budget efficiency by ensuring that funds are allocated where they are needed most
* Strengthened government position by advocating for needs of all, including the poor and the underrepresented rights
* Increased information flow surrounding needs of those who are usually discriminated against
A sex-responsive budget may also work to address issues of unpaid care work and caring labor gaps.&lt;ref name="United Nations Development Programme 2005"/&gt;

===Research/data improvements===
Current research which uses sex-aggregated statistics may underplay or minimize the quantitative presentation of issues such as maternal mortality, violence against women, and girls' school attendance.&lt;ref name="unicef.org" /&gt; Sex-disaggregated statistics are lacking in the assessment of maternal mortality rates, for example. Prior to [[UNICEF]] and [[UNIFEM]] efforts to gather more accurate and comprehensive data, 62 countries had no recent national data available regarding maternal mortality rates.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2006"&gt;{{citation | last = United Nations | contribution = Chapter 2: Health | editor-last = United Nations | title = The world's women 2005: progress in statistics | page = 26 | publisher = [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] | location = New York | year = 2006 | url = https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/indwm/wwpub.htm | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/indwm/ww2005_pub/English/WW2005_chpt_2_Health_BW.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Only 38 countries have sex-disaggregated statistics available to report frequency of violence against women.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2006" /&gt; 41 countries collect sex-disaggregated data on school attendance, while 52 countries assess sex-disaggregated wage statistics.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2006"/&gt;

Though the representation has become a much larger picture, it is important to notice the inclination of political activity emphasizing women over the years in different countries. "Although women's representation in [[Latin America]], [[Africa]], and [[Western culture|the West]] progressed slowly until 1995, in the most recent decade, these regions show substantial growth, doubling their previous percentage".&lt;ref name="Paxton" /&gt;

Researching politics on a global scale does not just reinvent ideas of politics, especially towards women, but brings about numerous concepts. Sheri Kunovich and Pamela Paxton research method, for example, took a different path by studying "cross-national" implications to politics, taking numerous countries into consideration. This approach helps identify research beforehand that could be helpful in figuring out commodities within countries and bringing about those important factors when considering the overall representation of women. "At the same time, we include information about the inclusion of women in the political parties of each country".&lt;ref name="Kunovich" /&gt; Research within gender and politics has taken a major step towards a better understanding of what needs to be better studied. Dr. Mona L. Krook states: These kinds of studies help establish that generalizing countries together is far too limiting to the overall case that we see across countries and that we can take the information we gain from these studies that look at countries separately and pose new theories as to why countries have the concepts they do; this helps open new reasons and thus confirms that studies need to be performed over a much larger group of factors.&lt;ref name=7Krook&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Krook | first = Mona Lena | title = Candidate gender quotas: a framework for analysis | journal = [[European Journal of Political Research]] | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–394 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6765.2007.00704.x | date = May 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2007.00704.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.mlkrook.org/pdf/ejpr_07.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Authors and researchers such as Mala Htun and Laurel Weldon also state that single comparisons of established and developed countries is simply not enough but is also surprisingly hurtful to the progress of this research, they argue that focusing on a specific country "tends to duplicate rather than interrogate" the overall accusations and concepts we understand when comparing political fields.&lt;ref name=Htun&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Htun | first1 = Mala | last2 = Weldon | first2 = S.

* Modified version also [http://thedemocracypapers.ssrc.org/the-politics-of-policies-to-promote-gender-justice/ available online].&lt;/ref&gt; They continue by explaining that comparative politics has not established sex equality as a major topic of discussion among countries.&lt;ref name="Htun" /&gt; This research challenges the current standings as to what needs to be the major focus in order to understand gender in politics.

A 2018 study in the ''American Economic Journal: Economic Policy'' found that for German local elections "female council candidates advance more from their initial list rank when the mayor is female. This effect spreads to neighboring municipalities and leads to a rising share of female council members."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baskaran|first=Thushyanthan|last2=Hessami|first2=Zohal|date=August 2018|title=Does the Election of a Female Leader Clear the Way for More Women in Politics?|url=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170045|journal=American Economic Journal: Economic Policy|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=95–121|doi=10.1257/pol.20170045|issn=1945-7731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grassroots women's empowerment movements===
[[File:The lady in the case.jpg|thumb|The lady in the case, an example of how some have interpreted women's involvement in government]]
Women's informal collectives are crucial to improving the standard of living for women worldwide. Collectives can address such issues as nutrition, education, shelter, food distribution, and generally improved standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = McNulty | first = Stephanie | title = Women's organizations during and after war: from service delivery to policy advocacy | page = 3 | publisher = Center for Development Information and Evaluation, [[United States Agency for International Development|US Agency for International Aid]] | location = Washington, DC | date = 2 October 1998 | url = http://genderandsecurity.org/projects-resources/research/womens-organizations-during-and-after-war-service-delivery-policy | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Document ref: PN-ACD-336. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.511.2415&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Empowering such collectives can increase their reach to the women most in need of support and empowerment. Though women's movements have a very successful outcome with the emphasis on gaining equality towards women, other movements are taking different approaches to the issue. Women in certain countries, instead of approaching the demands as representation of women as "a particular interest group", have approached the issue on the basis of the "[[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] of sex differences and the relation to the nation".&lt;ref name="Htun" /&gt; Htun and Weldon also bring up the point of democracy and its effects on the level of equality it brings. In their article, they explain that a democratic country is more likely to listen to "[[autonomous]] organizing" within the government. Women's movements would benefit from this the most or has had great influence and impact because of [[democracy]], though it can become a very complex system.&lt;ref name="Htun" /&gt; When it comes to local government issues, political standings for women are not necessarily looked upon as a major issue. "Even civil society organizations left women's issues off the agenda. At this level, traditional leaders also have a vested interest that generally opposes women's interests".&lt;ref name="Amanda" /&gt; Theorists believe that having a setback in government policies would be seen as catastrophic to the overall progress of women in government. Amanda Gouws says that "The instability of democratic or nominally democratic [[regimes]] makes women's political gains very vulnerable because these gains can be easily rolled back when regimes change. The failure to make the private sphere part of political contestation diminishes the power of formal democratic rights and limits solutions to gender inequality".&lt;ref name="Amanda" /&gt;

=== Australia ===
''Further information: [[Women and government in Australia|Women and Government in Australia]]''

In 1902, [[Australia]] became the first country to give some women the vote and allow them to stand for Parliament. This did not apply to [[Aboriginal Australians]], including women, until the amendment of the [[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918|Electoral Act]] in 1962. It wasn't until 1983 that Indigenous people had voting rights entirely equal to white Australians when another amendment made enrollment to vote compulsory, rather than voluntary.&lt;ref name="No. 3 - Women in the Senate"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief03|title=No. 3 - Women in the Senate|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19 years after the [[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902|Commonwealth Franchise Act]] was passed, [[Edith Cowan]] was elected to Legislative Assembly and became the first woman ever elected in any Australian Parliament.

In [[History of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]], placing women in government has progressed better than in other [[Islamic countries]].  Universal suffrage was introduced in [[Azerbaijan]] in 1918 by the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], thus making Azerbaijan the first [[Muslim-majority countries]] and Turk-majority countries ever to enfranchise women. Now, 28 women are members in the [[Azerbaijan Parliament]] ([[Milli Məclis]]). As of 2015, there were 21 women in the 125-seat parliament. The percentage of female members of parliament increased from 11 to 17 percent between 2005 and 2015. Traditional social norms and lagging economic development in the country's rural regions continued to restrict the role of women in the economy, and there were reports that women had difficulty exercising their legal rights due to gender discrimination. As of May 2009, women held the positions of Deputy Chairman of the Constitutional Court, Deputy Chairman of the Nakhchivan AR Cabinet of Ministers, four Deputy Ministers, an Ambassador, and Ombudsmen of [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] AR. Women constituted 4 of the 16 members of the Central Election Commission and chaired of 3 of the 125 district election commissions. Some famous female managers in historical [[Azerbaijan]] territories mentioned below:
* [[Tomyris]] – antic women leader of [[Scythians]], was born in near of [[Araks River]]

===Brazil===
A 1995 Brazilian gender quota was extended first to city councilor positions in 1996, then extended to candidates of all political legislative positions by 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sacchet | first = Teresa | title = Beyond numbers: the impact of gender quotas in Latin America | journal = [[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 369–386 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/14616740802185700 | date = 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/14616740802185700 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998, 30% of political candidates had to be women, with varied results in terms of the gender balance of the officials ultimately elected. Though the percentage of national legislature seats occupied by women dropped in the initial years following the passage of the quota law, the percentage has since risen (from 6.2% pre-quota, to 5.7% in 1998, to 8.9% in 2006). However, Brazil has struggled with the quota law in several respects:
* Though the quota law mandates a certain percentage of candidate spots be reserved for women, it is not compulsory that those spots be filled by women.
* The quota law also allowed political parties to increase the number of candidates, further increasing electoral competition and having a negligible impact on the actual number of women elected.

=== China ===
China's stipulation for gender equality in the political sphere started on as early as recorded in its 1954 Constitution, in which the PRC government stated that men and women enjoy equal rights in the aspects of political, economic, cultural, social and family dimensions, especially highlighting legitimate voting right and the right to be elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=Xiajuan|date=January 2008|title=The rise of affirmative action|url=https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/iaps/documents/cpi/briefings/briefing-34-women-political-participation.pdf|journal=WOMEN'S POLITICAL PARTICIPATION IN CHINA|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another State document – Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Woman – also outlined an official requirement of 'appropriate number of women deputies', combined with the State's obligations to 'gradually increase the proportion of the women deputies' and 'actively trains and selects female cadres' in fundamental national institutions and political organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/government/207405.htm|title=Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=www.china.org.cn|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For decades that follow, China has been making revision to its constitutional laws and State announcements to give recognition to  women's role in the domain of governance. An example of which is the proclamation issued on the 5th meeting session of the 10th National People's Congress (NPC) necessitating that 'the proportion of women delegates to be elected to the 11th People's Congress should be no less than 20%'.

However, regardless of the proper representation of women's political eligibility across multiple government declarations, the political system in China remains overwhelmingly male-dominated which in turns drives the low engagement rate of women delegates. Despite the new 13th NPC lineup with a composition of 742 women out of 2,980 representatives, which amounts to 24.9% penetration with 1.5 points increase as opposed to the former term,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-02/24/c_136997333.htm|title=More women, fewer officials on China's top legislature – Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn|website=www.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is mere presence of women in the central power structure in major government organs and their political influences are vastly diminished as they climb up the political ladder. Justifications of the above statement include the fact that only 33 women (9%) are recorded to have a seat at the table of Central Committee for the election of members into the Politburo, a key cornerstone for the approval all national affairs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41652487|title=Reality Check: Are women welcome in Chinese politics?|date=2017-10-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, except for the two consecutive office in 1973 and 1977, the Central Committee has never witnessed over 10% of women engagement in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=ZQMtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=-+With+the+exception+of+the+10th+Party+Congress+in+1973+and+the+11th+Party+Congress+in+1977,+women+have+never+made+up+more+than+10+percent+of+the+total+membership+of+the+Central+Committee.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-wRi5Wu_TB&amp;sig=nh4Ec2KLGA-hVTYf8RbM5Q5NLSk&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjh_I29_8bZAhVMk5QKHRYZDgcQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=-%20With%20the%20exception%20of%20the%2010th%20Party%20Congress%20in%201973%20and%20the%2011th%20Party%20Congress%20in%201977,%20women%20have%20never%20made%20up%20more%20than%2010%20percent%20of%20the%20total%20membership%20of%20the%20Central%20Committee.&amp;f=false|title=Young China: How the Restless Generation Will Change Their Country and the World|last=Dychtwald|first=Zak|date=2018-02-13|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9781466891333|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with the above figure is the decline in the 25-member Politburo from two women down to one. In addition, the recent reappointment of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, has sparked controversy on the unbroken record of no-women Politburo Standing Committee and absence of female top leaders in any legislature in China's political history, apart from the exceptions of Vice Premier, Liu Yandong and Vice Foreign Minister, Fu Ying. The public has been compelled to draw parallel with Hong Kong and Taiwan where female presidents – Carrie Lam and Tsai Ing-wen – took office in 2018 and 2016 respectively.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/22/asia/china-female-leaders/index.html|title=Why China has so few female leaders|last=CNN|first=Yazhou Sun,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The male-heavy politics amidst the favorable women's right protection in China can be examined from the following underlying causes:

''(1) Deprivation of upward mobility''

While the implied prerequisite of national appointment is years of experience serving at middle-to-top management, women in the PRC government often struggle to obtain promotion to high-ranked positions, such as party secretary or principal governor.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The reason contributing to the captioned phenomenon is gender division of labor across all levels of political structures. Contrary to Mao Zedong's saying that 'Women hold up half of the sky', Confucians principles' deeply ingrained advocacy “nan zhu wai, nu zhu nei” (men working on the outside, women's place remains on the inside) has shaped gender division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feng|first=Xianghong|date=2013-07-01|title=Women's Work, Men's Work: Gender and Tourism among the Miao in Rural China|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/awr.12002/abstract|journal=Anthropology of Work Review|language=en|volume=34|issue=1|pages=2–14|doi=10.1111/awr.12002|issn=1548-1417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being assigned highly gender-biased responsibilities within the spectrum of 'women affairs', such as family planning that are reproduction-oriented or with connection to social construction, women's public role and scope of duty are framed under constraints. Women are, at the same time, missing the opportunities to keep a foothold in strategic national affairs, including but not limited to economic development, military planning and diplomatic involvement. The mentioned dilemma is reflected by an actual example in Ning Xiang County, Hunan Province. Women commonly maintain highest authority as Head in women-related bodies, administering concerns on women's unfair treatments and suggesting for children's health development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=Jude|date=January 2008|title=The representation of women in rural politics|url=|journal=Women's Political Participation in China: in whose interests elections?|volume=|pages=|via=Journal of Contemporary China}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the same token, the gendered portfolio gives rise to empowerment of male in the political hierarchal. Consequently, with the lack of exposure to the exemplary official posts and the exclusive offering of key national assignments for men, women's upward mobility is aggravated, resulting in the substantially dwindling likelihood of taking residence in key leading positions.

''(2) Biased retirement precondition prejudicing against women''

In China, there is an apparent discrepancy in the mandatory retirement age between men and women, in which men are entitled to enjoy 10 more years of work. This policy was established on the ground that women are primary and central support for domestic subjects and their early retirement (at the age of 50–55) would be beneficial to their overall family functioning.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This discriminatory policy mirrors the cause in the previous part, in which the working capacity of women is restricted by the society's stereotype on their gender role and corresponding gender responsibilities. In addition, the average age of Chinese chief in Central Committee is 56.1 years old; Top leaders in Politburo were appointed at an average age of 61.1 years old; Whereas Standing Committee of Politburo has the highest average age of 63.4 for its office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jinghan|first=Zeng|year=2014|title=Institutionalization of the authoritarian leadership in China: a power succession system with Chinese characteristics?|journal=[[Contemporary Politics]]|volume=20|issue=3|pages=294–314|doi=10.1080/13569775.2014.911502|via=[[ResearchGate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; All figures being examined, the aggregated average age of appointed leaders exceeds the legal retirement age of women in the nation, meaning that women are least likely to become the center of power before their career come to an end.

(3) ''Anti-feminism''

While in foreign countries, women's socio-economic status is uplifted and gender division of labor is largely wiped out by feminist movements to open up the availability and variety of work for women, the conservative and politically-sensitive Chinese government's censorship on feminism within the country has spread fear among feminism advocates. An illustrative case of which is the backlash of 'Feminist Five' in China. The activists suffered from interrogation, detention and month-long imprisonment due to the distribution of stickers on Beijing subways for drawing the wider community's awareness to sexual harassment against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/08/feminist-stickers-china-backash-women-activists|title=I went to jail for handing out feminist stickers in China {{!}} Li Maizi|last=Maizi|first=Li|date=2017-03-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followed by the forced suspension of Weibo account 'Feminist Voices' due to the government's tightened censorship, feminist encountered escalated obstacles in promoting gender equality. Feminist movements are yet to achieve their goals.

===Finland===
The Finnish national quota law, introduced in 1995, mandates that among all indirectly elected public bodies (at both a national and a local level), neither sex in the governing body can be under 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Holli | first1 = Anne Maria | last2 = Luhtakallio | first2 = Eeva | last3 = Raevaara | first3 = Eeva | title = Quota trouble: talking about gender quotas in Finnish local politics | journal = [[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–193 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/14616740600612822 | date = June 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/14616740600612822 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://blogs.helsinki.fi/holli/files/2013/05/RFJP1612641.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 laws was a reformed version of a similar 1986 law. Unlike other countries' quota laws, which affect party structure or electoral candidate lists, the Finnish law addresses indirectly elected bodies (nominated by official authorities)—the law does not address popularly elected bodies. The Finnish law heavily emphasizes local municipal boards and other subnational institutions. From 1993 (pre-quota law) to 1997 (post-quota law), the proportion of women on municipal executive boards increased from 25% to 45%. The quota law also affected gender segregation in local governance: before the passage of the law, there had been a gender imbalance in terms of female overrepresentation in "soft-sector" boards (those concerned with health, education, etc.) and female "underrepresentation" in "hard-sector" boards (those concerned with economics and technology). In 1997, the boards were balanced horizontally. However, areas not subject to quota laws continue to be imbalanced. In 2003, it was determined that only 16% of the chairs of municipal executive boards are female—chair positions in this area are not quota-regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pikkala | first = Sari | title = Representations of women in Finnish local government: effects of the 1995 gender quota legislation | year = 2000 }} Paper presented at the European Consortium on Political Research Joint Sessions of Workshops, Copenhagen, 14–19 April.
&lt;/ref&gt; Presidential elections were held in Finland on 16 January 2000, with a second round on 6 February;&lt;ref name=DN&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Nohlen | editor-first1 = Dieter | editor-last2 = Stöver | editor-first2 = Philip | editor-link1 = Dieter Nohlen | title = Elections in Europe: a data handbook | page = 606 | publisher = Nomos | location = Baden-Baden, Germany | year = 2010 | isbn = 9783832956097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the result was a victory for [[Tarja Halonen]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]], who became the country's first female President.

===Germany===
	The gender quotas implemented across parties in Germany in the 1990s serve as a natural experiment for the effect of sub-national party political gender quotas on women participation. Davidson-Schmich (2006) notes, "the German case provides the variance needed to explain the successful (or failed) implementation of these political party quotas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Davidson-Schmich | first = Louise K. | title = Implementation of political party gender quotas: evidence from the German Länder 1990–2000 | journal = [[Party Politics]] | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 211–232 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1354068806061338 | date = March 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/1354068806061338 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.564.1797&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's sixteen state legislatures, the Länder, feature a variety of party systems and varied numbers of potential female candidates. Germany is rated highly in its gender gap, but is an example of a developed country with a low percentage of female leadership in politics.
	Davidson-Schmich's study shows that there are many factors that influence how effective a political quota for women will be. Because Germany's quotas cover culturally diverse areas, Davidson-Schmich was able to see which cities best responded to the increase in women running for office. In her bivariate study, the quota was more successful when the city had a PR electoral system, when more women held inner-party and local political offices, and when there were more women in state-level executive offices. The quota was less successful in rural areas, areas with a large number of Catholic voters, electoral systems with a preferential system, in extremely competitive party systems, and with greater rates of legislative turnover. In her multivariate study of these regions, however, Davidson-Schmich narrowed these factors down even further to the most significant variables of: Catholicism and agricultural economics (Davidson-Schmich, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;228). This is very intriguing, and as she explains, "the success of voluntary gender quotas in the German states hinged not on the political structure of these Lander, but rather the willingness of within the system to act on the opportunities inherent in these structures" (Davidson-Schmich, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;228). Social factors and inherent gender discrimination are more important in the success of a female political quota than the structure of the quota itself.

In an effort to increase women's participation in politics in India, a 1993 constitutional amendment mandated that a randomly selected third of leadership positions at every level of local government be reserved for women.&lt;ref name="Raising Female Leaders"&gt;{{cite book | last = J-PAL | author-link = Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab | title = Raising female leaders | publisher = [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab|J-PAL Policy Briefcase]] | date = April 2012 | url = http://www.povertyactionlab.org/publication/raising-female-leaders }}&lt;/ref&gt; These political reservation quotas randomly choose one third of cities to implement a women-only election.&lt;ref name="Bhavnani, Rikhil 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bhavnani | first = Rikhil R. | title = Do electoral quotas work after they are withdrawn?

Due to the randomized selection of cities who must enforce the reservation for women each election year, some cities have implemented the quota multiple times, once or never. This addresses the political discrimination of women at various levels: parties are forced to give women the opportunity to run, the women candidates are not disadvantaged by a male incumbent or general biases for male over female leadership, and the pool of women candidates is increased because of the guaranteed opportunity for female participation.&lt;ref name="Bhavnani, Rikhil 2009" /&gt;  The effects of the quota system in India have been studied by various researchers.

Given the opportunity to get a party ticket, create a platform and obtain the experience to run for a political position, women are much more likely to be able to overcome these hurdles in the future, even without the quota system in place.&lt;ref name="Bhavnani, Rikhil 2009"/&gt; The quota system has also affected policy choices.

===Japan===
Japan ranks 127 in the world for the number of women in national parliamentary worldwide as of March 2014, which is lower than that of 2013 in which Japan ranked at 122.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kyodo | author-link = Kyodo News | title = Japan falls to 127th global ranking of female lawmakers | url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/03/12/national/japan-falls-to-127th-global-ranking-of-female-lawmakers/ |work = [[The Japan Times]] | date = March 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 28, 2013, there are a total of 39 women in the House of Representatives out of 479 incumbents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Strength of political groups in the House of Representatives | url = http://www.shugiin.go.jp/internet/itdb_english.nsf/html/statics/english/strength.htm | website = shugiin.go.jp | publisher = The House of Representatives | location = Japan }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since the enactment of the modern [[Constitution of Japan|Japanese Constitution]] in 1947, Japanese women have been given the right to vote, and the new version of the constitution also allows for a more democratic form of government that guarantees women equality under the law. 
The first female cabinet member, [[Masa Nakayama]], was appointed as the Minister of Health and Welfare in Japan in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwdc.org/resources/timeline.htm|title=International Women's Democracy Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Until 1996, the electoral system for the House of Representatives was based on a single non-transferable vote in multi-member districts. That system was not conducive to women's advancement in public office because it promoted contestation between competing parties and rival candidates within the same party,{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} but overall, the new electoral system was introduced to reduce the excessive role of money and corruption in elections, which ultimately helped women who were running for public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Iwanaga | first= Kazuki | title = Women's political representation and electoral system in Japan }} 1st International Conference Women and Politics in Asia. Conference Paper. Halmstad: Halmstad University, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Japanese politics, the [[Koenkai|kōenkai]] is a major factor for a successful outcome of an election. The kōenkai, or "local support groups", serve as pipelines through which funds and other support are conveyed to legislators and through which the legislators can distribute favors to constituents in return. Because gaining support from these groups is usually based on personal connections, women's historically disadvantaged position in networking circles hurts their ability to run for public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Krauss | first1 = Ellis S. | last2 = Pekkanen | first2 = Robert J. | contribution = The kōenkai: origin and development of a vote-mobilization machine | editor-last1 = Krauss | editor-first1 = Ellis S. | editor-last2 = Pekkanen | editor-first2 = Robert J. | title = The rise and fall of Japan's LDP : political party organizations as historical institutions | pages = 32–33 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780801476822 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1996, Japan adopted another new electoral system for the House of Representatives that combines single-seat districts with proportional representation. Out of 480 seats, 300 are contested in single seat constituencies. The other 180 members are elected through allocations to an electoral list submitted by each party. Candidates who lack a strong support system are listed on a party's proportional representation section. In the 2009 election, only two of eight female [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] members were elected from a single-seat district, which indicates that few female candidates have enough political support to win a single-seat election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Nakano | first =Yūko | title = Japan chair platform: among equals?

As for the future of women in politics in Japan, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe announced in his speech at the Japan National Press Club on April 19, 2013, that a major goal of his national growth strategy is "having no less than 30 per cent of leadership positions in all areas of society filled by women by 2020." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Speech on growth strategy by Prime Minister Shinzō Abe at the Japan National Press Club | url = http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/96_abe/statement/201304/19speech_e.html | website = .kantei.go.jp | publisher = Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet | date = April 19, 2013 }} (Speeches and Statements by Prime Minister.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Demonstrating women.jpg|thumb|Lebanese women marching for their rights]]
Lebanese women are considered to have more rights and freedom compared to other women in the Gulf and Middle East.{{By whom|date=June 2017}} Women in Lebanon are able to dress more liberally and move around with relative ease in certain parts of the country, unlike other countries in the region. Lebanese women enjoy almost equal civil rights as men. However, due to the large number of officially recognized religions in Lebanon, Lebanese family matters are governed by at least 15 personal statute codes. Lebanese women have legal protection that varies depending on their religion.

Local and regional NGOs have helped to increase awareness of violence against women in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lnf.org.lb/windex/introduction.html|title=Women's Rights Monitor|date=|publisher=Lnf.org.lb|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2012/Mar-25/167921-over-30-ngos-demonstrate-for-womens-rights.ashx#axzz1rcyhFq4K|title=Over 30 NGOs demonstrate for women's rights|date=|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government policies regarding this are poor however, and attempts to improve this area have been met with resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report/95033/LEBANON-Tussle-over-gender-violence-law|title=IRIN Middle East &amp;#124; Lebanon: Tussle over gender violence law &amp;#124; Lebanon &amp;#124; Early Warning &amp;#124; Gender Issues &amp;#124; Governance &amp;#124; Human Rights &amp;#124; Security|date=2012-03-08|publisher=Irinnews.org|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanon's laws do not recognize the concept of spousal rape,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderindex.org/country/lebanon|title=Gender Equality in Lebanon &amp;#124; Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI)|date=|publisher=Genderindex.org|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempts to add this to law have been attacked by Lebanese clerics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arabnews.com/middleeast/article462177.ece|title=Lebanon's clerics attack domestic violence law|last=Miller|first=David E.|accessdate=February 4, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630135532/http://arabnews.com/middleeast/article462177.ece|archivedate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Netherlands ===
In 2016, the Dutch government achieved their goal for women in top jobs within the government. A 30% female share was achieved two years earlier than anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/politiek/rijksoverheid-haalt-streefcijfer-vrouwen-in-topfuncties~a4302524/|title=Rijksoverheid haalt streefcijfer vrouwen in topfuncties – Politiek – Voor nieuws, achtergronden en columns|last=Giebels|first=Robert|website=De Volkskrant|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In business, the number of women in top jobs is behind in the political sector. In 2013, the listed companies inserted a 'one in three' rule, which meant that of every three top jobs, one must be exerted by a woman. Not long after, it turned out companies did not put much effort in to achieving this goal, as in practice even less than one in every ten top jobs was occupied by women. The goal for women in top jobs was postponed to 2023. Government and the business sector agreed that if every one in five top jobs is not exerted by women, after 2018 the 30% rule will become mandatory.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bakker, F. S., &amp; Kartner, F. (2013). Excuustruus of echte topvrouw? Over de wenselijkheid van vrouwenquota in het bedrijfsleven. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, women's quota received a fair share of criticism. It has been argued that women should be employed based on their own qualities, not because of their gender.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Romania===
No political gender quotas exist in Romania, however the Equality Act of 2002 provides that public authorities and institutions, political parties, employers' organizations and trade unions must provide an equitable and balanced representation of men and women at all decisional levels.&lt;ref&gt;Current legal framework: {{cite web | url=http://www.impowr.org/research/romania/Participation%20in%20policy%20formation%20and%20implementation | title=Participation in policy formation and implementation in Romania | website = impowr.org | publisher = International Models Project on Women's Rights (IMPOWR) | accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Romanian legislative election, 2016|2016 elections]], women gained only 20.7% of seats in the Lower House ([[Chamber of Deputies (Romania)|Romanian Chamber of Deputies]]) and 14.7% in the Upper House ([[Senate of Romania]]).&lt;ref name="IPU_class" /&gt; These figures are up from the 4.9% of women in the Romanian Parliament in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.roaep.ro/prezentare/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/women_Parliament.pdf | title=The evolution of woman representation in Romanian Parliament | website = roaep.ro | publisher= Romania Autoritatea Electorala Permanenta [Permanent Electoral Authority] | date = February 2013 | accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, women are well represented in the central public administration, including the [[Government of Romania|Government]], with more than half of decision-making positions held by women, according to a 2011 study commissioned by the [[Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Protection (Romania)|Ministry of Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Role of traditions: {{cite web | url=http://www.impowr.org/research/romania/Participation%20in%20policy%20formation%20and%20implementation | title=Participation in policy formation and implementation in Romania | website = impowr.org | publisher = International Models Project on Women's Rights (IMPOWR) | accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rwanda===
	Since the election of 2008, Rwanda is the first country to have a majority of women in legislature.&lt;ref name="Abbott"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Abbott | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Haerpfer | first2 = Christian | last3 = Wallace | first3 = Claire | author-link1 = Pamela Abbott | title = Women in Rwandan politics and society | journal = [[International Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 111–125 | doi = 10.2753/IJS0020-7659380406 | date = Winter 2008  |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2753/IJS0020-7659380406 | publisher = M.

After the genocide that killed 800,000 Tutsis in 100 days, women in legislature went from 18% women before the conflict to 56% in 2008. Two pieces of legislature enabled and supported women into leadership positions: the Security Council Resolution of 1325 urged women to take part in the post-conflict reconstruction and the 2003 Rwandan Constitution included a mandated quota of 30% reserved seats for all women in legislature. Of the 24 women who gained seats directly after the quota implementation in 2003, many joined political parties and chose to run again. Though it took almost 10 years, after implementing the gender quotas, Rwanda reached levels of female representation which are amongst the highest in the world.&lt;ref name="Carmichael" /&gt; Once again we can see the quota working as an "incubator" for driving women's participation in leadership.

It is argued that the increase of female leadership in Rwanda also led to an increase in gender equality. World Focus (2009) writes, "Rwandan voters have elected women in numbers well beyond the mandates dictated by the post-genocide constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The top ten innovative global solutions of the decade (blog) | url = http://worldfocus.org/blog/2009/12/30/the-top-10-innovative-global-solutions-of-the-decade/8991/ | website = worldfocus.org | publisher = Worldfocus | date = December 30, 2009 | access-date = September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; And though women in Rwanda still face discrimination, female legislators have influenced major reforms in banking and property laws." A parliamentary women's caucus in Rwanda (FFRP) has also "led a successful effort to pass ground-breaking legislation on gender-based violence in part by involving and garnering support from their male colleagues".&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;

While some researchers see reform, others see dominant party tactics. Hassim (2009) writes, "It could be argued that in both countries [Uganda and Rwanda] women's representation provided a kind of alibi for the progressive, 'democratic' nature of new governments that at their core nevertheless remained authoritarian, and increasingly so".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hassim | first = Shireen | contribution = Perverse consequences?

===Spain===
In 2007, Spain passed the Equality Law, requiring a "principle of balanced presence" by mandating political parties to include 40–60% of each sex among electoral candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Verge | first = Tània | title = Gendering representation in Spain: opportunities and limits of gender quotas | journal = [[Journal of Women, Politics &amp; Policy]] | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 166–190 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/15544771003697247 | date = 2010 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/15544771003697247 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law is unique in that surpasses the 40% parity figure established by the European Commission in 1998; a figure which (according to the EC) indicates "parity democracy." Though there is anecdotal evidence of increasing female representation on a local and national level, there has not yet been national-level data to quantitatively bolster this assertion.

On June 6, 2018, Pedro Sánchez, the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party, presented his cabinet which included eleven women and six men, making it the cabinet with the highest proportion of women in the world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20180606/gobierno-mujeres-europeista-experiencia-gestion-independientes-fotografia-del-nuevo-gabinete/1746182.shtml|title=Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez: El Gobierno de las mujeres|date=6 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States no political gender quotas exist, mandatory or voluntary. The proportion of women in leadership roles in the Senate, House of Representatives, and Presidential positions reflect this. Although the proportion has grown since the first female elected into the Senate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lieber|first1=Constance |last2=Sillitos |first2=John |title= Martha Hughes Cannon |url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/people/marthahughescannon.html|website=Utah History To Go|publisher=Utah State Historical Society|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the current position of women representation in the U.S. is precarious. In the elections of 2012, the greatest number of female incumbents ever were up for re-election in the Senate. Ten female Democrats, six of them incumbents, were nominated, with one Republican nominated for Senate ran for office.&lt;ref name="Steinhauer, Jennifer 2011"&gt;{{cite news | last = Steinhauer | first = Jennifer | author-link = Jennifer Steinhauer | title = More women in Senate, but seats are at risk | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/us/politics/women-could-have-banner-year-in-2012-election.html | work = [[The New York Times|New York Times Journal]] | date = October 20, 2011 | location = New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinhauer notes that in Congress, both in the Senate and the House of Representatives, women historically and currently lack representation.

From 1917, when Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana became the first woman to serve in Congress, to the 115th congress, a total of 329 women have served as U.S. Representatives, Delegates, or Senators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.house.gov/wic/|title=Women in Congress {{!}} US House of Representatives: History, Art &amp; Archives|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1917 to 2018, the United States has had 277 women serve in the House of Representatives.

From 1922, when Senator Rebecca Latimer Felton became the first woman to serve in the Senate, to 2018 52 women have served in the United States Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/women_senators.htm|title=U.S. Senate: Women in the Senate|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 115th Congress, 107 (78D, 29R) women hold seats in the United States Congress, comprising 20.0% of the 535 members; 23 women (23%) serve in the U.S. Senate, and 84 women (19.3%) serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/women-us-congress-2018|title=Women in the U.S. Congress 2018|date=2015-06-12|work=CAWP|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States is one of the shrinking number of industrialized democracies to not have yet had a woman as its leader. Worldwide, female prime ministers include Canada's [[Kim Campbell]], the UK's [[Margaret Thatcher]], Australia's [[Julia Gillard]], Israel's [[Golda Meir]], and France's [[Édith Cresson]]. Other female national leaders include Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] of Germany, President [[Dilma Rousseff]] of Brazil, and President [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel Perón]] of Argentina. Even Pakistan and Turkey, countries often viewed as particularly male-dominated have had female prime ministers. Therefore, the United States, a country which promotes the rights of women and girls around the world, is conspicuous for having only male presidents.

In popular media in the United States, female politicians see some focus on their appearance; more so than their male counterparts. A 2011 feminist journal by Carlin and Winfrey focuses on the portrayal of female politicians in the media. According to the journal, the way media perceives women and men is very distinct in the language they chose to use. The language chosen to talk or describe other people can either hurt or help them in a political campaign. As a result of
women being talked about in sexist terms in can greatly affect her reputation and credibility.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carlin | first1 = Diana B. | last2 = Winfrey | first2 = Kelly L. | title = Have you come a long way, baby?

The journal claims the media uses terms that indicative of women not being valued as individuals.  "This is especially true when women are described using metaphors that draw on animals, children, or food. Animal terms focus on the appearance and sexuality of young women (foxy), and as women grow older, or are seen as too aggressive, they may be called barracuda, old bat, shrew, or cow."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Females tend to have less issue coverage than males (due to fewer female politicians), but tend to have more coverage on things such as their appearance than male politicians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Men candidates don't get coverage on what kind of suite they are wearing or who designed it. This is due to innate purpose of the media to appeal to demands of their audiences for sales – in this case the popular female focus on fashion that dominates the media. Studies done on women candidates have shown that women receive more attention in the media for factors such as appearance, clothes, size, and emotional state&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;".
In 2015 Rachel Silbermann conducted a study that time spent traveling to and from work is particularly burdensome for those who spend time caring for children, and as women do a majority of the child care and housework, commuting is particularly burdensome to them. Silbermann also found that female students weigh proximity to home twice as heavily as male students do in a hypothetical decision of whether to run for higher office. She suggests that to achieve equal representation of women in government men and women will need to share household responsibilities more equally.&lt;ref name="Silberman, R. 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Silbermann | first = Rachel | title = Gender roles, work-life balance, and running for office | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Political Science]] | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–153 | publisher = Now Publishing Inc. | doi = 10.1561/100.00014087 | date = June 2015 | url = https://doi.org/10.1561/100.00014087 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study found no evidence that the low share of women in the  U.S. House of Representative was due to gender discrimination by voters.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Anastasopoulos |first=Lefteris | title = Estimating the gender penalty in House of Representative elections using a regression discontinuity design | journal = [[Electoral Studies]] | volume = 43 | issue =  | pages = 150–157 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.electstud.2016.04.008 | date = September 2016 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2016.04.008 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the author of the study, "these results suggest that the deficit of female representation in the House is more likely the result of barriers to entering politics as opposed to overt gender discrimination by voters and campaign donors."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2017 study found that over the last decade, public opposition to &amp;nbsp;electing a woman as president was reduced from approximately 26% to 13%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burden|first=Barry C.|last2=Ono|first2=Yoshikuni|last3=Yamada|first3=Masahiro|date=2017-05-04|title=Reassessing Public Support for a Female President|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/691799|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=79|issue=3|pages=1073–1078|doi=10.1086/691799|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

A 2018 study in the ''American Political Science Review'' did not find evidence that American voters were outright hostile to women in politics or that they held double standards. The study did however find that American voters preferred candidates who were married and had children. Since the burdens of child-rearing disproportionately fall on women in households, the bias in favor of married candidates with children may explain women's underrepresentation in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teele|first=Dawn Langan|last2=Kalla|first2=Joshua|last3=Rosenbluth|first3=Frances|date=2018|title=The Ties That Double Bind: Social Roles and Women's Underrepresentation in Politics|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/ties-that-double-bind-social-roles-and-womens-underrepresentation-in-politics/617A9986FF59B8934BC300DA21984121|journal=American Political Science Review|language=en|volume=|pages=1–17|doi=10.1017/S0003055418000217|issn=0003-0554|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Case Studies =====

====== Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton ======
In 2008, campaigns for both Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton were taken in great interest by fashion articles read mostly by women. The journal claims that Clinton was perceived as masculine and Palin was seen as feminine. "Palin's attractiveness resulted in frequent and varied references to her ''sexiness''; whereas, Clinton was viewed as not feminine enough in pantsuits that covered her ''cankles'' (thick ankles).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Various newspapers covered on how Palin was part of beauty pageants and this really affected the seriousness of her campaign. They took Palin as a joke and various individuals began to state that this was a political campaign and not
another beauty pageant. On the other hand Clinton was perceived as a "nut cracker" and "where boners go to die". Clinton's physical appearance and her choice of clothing, pantsuits over skirts and dresses, were the source of considerable ridicule.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Carlin and Winfrey believe that Clinton was not perceived as a sex symbol because she chose to wear pants over
skirts, and also because she was older than Palin. Due to the smaller proportion of women who pursue political careers, there is greater pressure on female politicians to succeed. The importance of criticisms about "cankles" and the like on public popularity in a presidential election is disputed. Many think these criticisms are neglegible, but Carlin and Winfrey believe this criticisms have a large effect. This analysis done on both Senator Clinton's and Governor Palin's campaign concluded that media coverage had a vast responsibility on how both women were viewed due to their gender
stereotypes and language used to "influence the public",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though others argue that the style of media coverage is entirely the result of existing demand by the audience. There was national sample done that concluded that 51% of respondents ''believed'' that Americans were not ready for a women to be elected into high office.&lt;ref name="Lawless, J. 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lawless | first = Jennifer L. | author-link = Jennifer L.

====== Nikki Haley ======
The ''New York Journal'' explains how many in the general public of South Carolina were ignorant of the fact that Haley was Indian-American. According to one of her co-workers in the state legislator, voters saw Haley as a “nice conservative woman with a tan.”&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://echo.louisville.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1985149982?accountid=14665|title="For Nikki Haley, Dealing with Foreign Tyrants is the Easy Part of the Job."|last=Rice|first=Andrew|date=11 December 2017|website=New York Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While running the first time, for House of Representatives, in a semi-rural district, some of the voters pledged against Haley and said they would not vote for any candidate whose father was an immigrant.

Throughout Haley's 2010 campaign for Governor, opponents attacked her gender. These sexist comments did not sway Haley, who was self-confident in her own skin. She was called a “rag-head,” and “Mark Sandford in a skirt.”&lt;ref name="Rice"/&gt; Haley responded in a positive way, she was not upset and seemed very level-headed. Then, one person who worked with Haley previously as a political consultant accused her of an affair. Haley rejected this very serious allegation and went forward to win the 2010 election for Governor of South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://echo.louisville.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1985149982?accountid=14665|title="For Nikki Haley, Dealing With Foreign Tyrants Is the Easy Part of the Job."|last=Rice|first=Andrew|date=11 December 2017|website=New York Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in government have historically been fewer in numbers in [[Western world|Western societies]] compared to men.  Some women, however, have served as heads of state and government. Although the number of women in government in the US has grown, they still hold less than 25% of government positions nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genderwatch2018.org/getting-to-congress-women/|title=The hardest part of being a woman in Congress?

==Comparing women's integration into branches of government==

===Executive branch===
Women have been notably in fewer numbers in the executive branch of government.  The gender gap has been closing, however, albeit slowly&lt;ref name="Social Development 2005"/&gt; The first women other than monarchs to hold head of state positions were in socialist countries. The first was [[Khertek Anchimaa-Toka]] of the [[Tuvan People's Republic]] from 1940–1944, followed by [[Sükhbaataryn Yanjmaa]] of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] 1953–1954 and [[Soong Ching-ling]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] from 1968–1972 and 1981.

Following the socialist countries, the Nordic countries have been forerunners in including women in the executive branch. The [[second cabinet Brundtland]] (1986–1989) was historical in that 8 out of 18 cabinet members were women, and in 2007 the [[second cabinet Stoltenberg]] (2005–2013) was more than 50% women.

In 2003, Finland had a historical moment when all top leaders of the country were women and also represented different political parties: [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social democrat]] [[Tarja Halonen]] was President, [[Riitta Uosukainen]] from [[National Coalition Party]] was [[Speaker of the Parliament of Finland|Speaker of the Parliament]] and after the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2003|parliamentary elections of 2003]] [[Anneli Jäätteenmäki]] from [[Centre Party (Finland)|Center party]] was on her way to become the first female [[Prime Minister of Finland]]. By June 22, 2010 [[Mari Kiviniemi]] of the Centre Party was appointed the second female [[Prime Minister of Finland]].

Between 2007 and 2011 the Finnish cabinet was 60% female, with a female Prime Minister from 2010 to 2011. Between 2014 and 2015 the Finnish cabinet was 59% female.

The present Danish government is a coalition between the Social Democrats, the Social-Liberal Party and the Socialist People's Party. All three parties have female leaders. [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] is Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Preisler | first = Marie | title = Denmark's gender equality policies: no quotas and a focus on men | journal = [[Nordic Labour Journal]] | publisher = [[Work Research Institute]] and [[Oslo and Akershus University College]] | date = March 8, 2013 | url = http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/i-fokus/in-focus-2013/equality-reaching-critical-mass/article.2013-03-08.2356410784 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's first elected [[List of elected or appointed female heads of state|female president]] was [[Vigdís Finnbogadóttir]] of [[Iceland]], whose term lasted from 1980 to 1996.

In 2005, [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] of [[Liberia]] became Africa's first elected female head of state.

===Legislative branch===
It was not until World War I and the first socialist revolutions that the first few women became members of governments. [[Alexandra Kollontai]] became the first female to hold a minister position, as the People's Commissar for Social Welfare in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = First female ministers | url = http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/First-female-ministers.htm | website = guide2womenleaders.com | publisher = Worldwide Guide to Women in Leadership }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nina Bang]], Danish Minister of Education from 1924–26, was the world's second full female cabinet minister.

The first female head of government was [[Evgenia Bosh]], the [[Bolshevik]] military leader who held the People's Secretary of Internal Affairs position in the Ukraine People's Republic of the Soviets of Workers and Peasants from 1917–1918, which was responsible for executive functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Woman Prime Ministers | url = http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/Premier_Ministers.htm | website = guide2womenleaders.com | publisher = Worldwide Guide to Women in Leadership }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ukraine | url = http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Ukraine.html | website = worldstatesmen.org | publisher = World Statesmen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Yevgenia Bosch (1879–1925) | url = http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/article?art_id=1261011&amp;cat_id=661258 | website = kmu.gov.ua | publisher = Government of Ukraine | language = Ukrainian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, development was slow and it was not until the end of the 20th century that female ministers stopped being unusual.

The first government organization formed with the goal of women's equality was the [[Zhenotdel]], in Soviet Russia.

According to a 2006 report by the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], 16% of all parliament members in the world are female. In 1995, the [[United Nations]] set a goal of 30% female representation.&lt;ref name="2006report"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Women politicians 'making gains' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4758036.stm |work=BBC News |date=28 February 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current annual growth rate of women in national parliaments is about 0.5% worldwide. At this rate, gender parity in national legislatures will not be achieved until 2068.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

The top ten countries in terms of number of female parliamentary members are [[Rwanda]] with 56.3%, [[Sweden]] (47.0%), [[Cuba]] (43.2%), [[Finland]] (41.5%), the [[Netherlands]] (41.3%), [[Argentina]] (40.0%), [[Denmark]] (38.0%), [[Angola]] (37.3%), [[Costa Rica]] (36.8%), [[Spain]] (36.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Women in national parliaments | url = http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/arc/classif301108.htm | website = ipu.org | publisher = [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{As of|2008|08|30}} Cuba has the highest percentage for countries without a quota. In South Asia, Nepal is highest in the rank of women participation in politics with (33%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071209123905/http://sapint.org/ | archive-date = December 9, 2007 | url = http://www.sapint.org/ | website = sapint.or | publisher = South Asian Partnership }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[East Asian]] countries, [[Taiwan]] has the highest percentage of women in Parliament (38.0%). In the United States in 2008, the [[New Hampshire State Senate]] became the first state legislature upper house to possess an elected female majority.

The United Kingdom and United States are roughly in line with the world average. The [[House of Lords]] has 139 women (19.7%), while there are [[Women in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom|125 women]] (19.4%) in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].

On November 6, 2012, New Hampshire made US History by having all-female congressional delegation to Congress with [[Annie Kuster]] being elected to [[New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district|represent New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district]] in the House of Representatives, [[Carol Shea-Porter]] regained her House seat to represent [[New Hampshire's 1st congressional district]] in the House of Representatives, and with [[Jeanne Shaheen]] and [[Kelly Ayotte]] both represented New Hampshire in the United States senate.&lt;ref&gt;New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2016, New Hampshire again made US History by having an all-female, all-[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] delegation to the US Congress. Incumbent Republican senator, Kelly Ayotte, was defeated by then-New Hampshire Governor, [[Maggie Hassan]], a Democrat, in the [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 2016|senate election]] to serve alongside Democratic senator, Jeanne Shaheen. Representative Carol Shea-Porter, a Democrat, defeated incumbent representative, [[Frank Guinta]], a Republican, again in New Hampshire's 1st congressional district to serve alongside Ann Kuster, who represents New Hampshire 2nd congressional district in the House of Representatives to achieve another historic "women's first".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-sending-first-all-woman-all-democratic-delegation-to-dc/8369972|title=New Hampshire Sending First All-Woman, All-Democratic Delegation to DC|first=Cam|last=Tranchemontagne|date=27 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local representation===
There has been an increasing focus on women's representation at a local level.&lt;ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003"/&gt;  Most of this research is focused on developing countries.  Governmental decentralization often results in local government structures that are more open to the participation of women, both as elected local councilors and as the clients of local government services.&lt;ref name="Social Development 2005"/&gt;
A 2003 survey conducted by United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), a global network supporting inclusive local governments, found that the average proportion of women in local council was 15%.  In leadership positions, the proportion of women was lower: for instance, 5% of mayors of Latin American municipalities are women.

According to a comparative study of women in local governments in East Asia and the Pacific, women have been more successful in reaching decision-making position in local governments than at the national level.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;  Local governments tend to be more accessible and have more available positions.  Also, women's role in local governments may be more accepted because they are seen as an extension of their involvement in the community.

====Indian panchayats====
The local panchayat system in India provides an example of women's representation at the local governmental level.&lt;ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003"/&gt; The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments in 1992 mandated panchayat elections throughout the country.  The reforms reserved 33% of the seats for women and for castes and tribes proportional to their population.  Over 700,000 women were elected after the reforms were implemented in April 1993.
