'''Action on Smoking and Health''' ('''ASH''') is the name of a number of autonomous [[pressure group]]s ([[charities]]) that seek to publicise the risks associated with [[tobacco smoking]] and campaign for [[Smoking ban|greater restrictions]] on cigarette and tobacco sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/erectiledysfunction/support_group/006145.htm ASH - Action on Smoking and Health]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[US]], ASH was formed in 1967 by [[John F. Banzhaf III]], and a distinguished body of physicians, attorneys and other prominent citizens who saw the need for an organization to represent nonsmokers’ rights. Over the years, ASH has taken the lead on a variety of initiatives to counter the deaths and economic burden imposed by the [[tobacco industry]].

ASH has a long history of advocacy, education and legal initiatives in the fight against tobacco. ASH has fought for health in courts, before legislative bodies and regulatory agencies, as well as international agencies such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Health Organization]].
ASH’s work and the work of its allies has spanned more than 40 years. Since the release of the original [[Surgeon General Report on smoking]] in January 1964, the global initiative for the prevention of tobacco-related damages has made enormous progress—and ASH has played a major role in achieving this progress.

ASH’s actions have led to significant progress, including:&lt;ref name="ASH website" /&gt;
* A [[Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act|ban on cigarette commercials]] over the airwaves in 1971;
* A decision by Congress to ban [[smoking on airline flights]] in 1990;
* The implementation of smoke-free legislation in a number of jurisdictions in the United States and other countries;
* A 2001 executive order by President [[Bill Clinton]] prohibiting the government from promoting the sale or export of tobacco products;
* Adoption and implementation of the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] (FCTC), the first international treaty that deals exclusively with tobacco issues.

In the [[United Kingdom]], ASH is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] established in 1971, that aims to eliminate the harm caused by tobacco. It works to raise awareness of the health risks of tobacco, and also campaigns for policy measures. It provides the secretariat of the [[All-Party Parliamentary Group]] on smoking and health.&lt;ref name="APPG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ash.org.uk/about-ash/all-party-parliamentary-group-on-smoking-and-health|title=All Party Parliamentary Group on Smoking and Health|author=|date=|website=ash.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=23 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530010302/http://www.ash.org.uk/about-ash/all-party-parliamentary-group-on-smoking-and-health|archivedate=30 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
ASH was established in 1971 by the [[Royal College of Physicians]] following the refusal of the [[UK Government]] to act on the College's demand for laws to reduce tobacco use. Former health minister, [[John Dunwoody]], became its first director.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |last=Roth |first=Andrew |date=1 February 2006 |title= John Dunwoody |url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/01/guardianobituaries.mainsection |newspaper=The Guardian |location= |access-date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its present-day board of trustees reflects its continued support from the medical establishment as it is composed largely of doctors and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ash.org.uk/about-ash/ash-board-of-trustees |title= ASH Board of Trustees |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=ash.org.uk |publisher= |access-date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASH was awarded a [[World Health Organization|WHO]] [[World No Tobacco Day]] award in May 2011&lt;ref name="World No Tobacco Day Awards 2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/disease-prevention/tobacco/activities/wntd-2011-who-framework-convention-on-tobacco-control/world-no-tobacco-day-awards-2011| publisher=World Health Organization | title=World No Tobacco Day Awards 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2012 Luther L Terry Award for "Outstanding Organization" by the [[American Cancer Society]] in December 2011.&lt;ref name="Luther Terry Award 2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fctc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=634:congratulations-luther-terry-award-winners&amp;catid=229:general-news&amp;Itemid=233| publisher=Framework Convention Alliance | title=Congratulations to Luther Terry Award winners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its current Chief Executive, appointed in 2003, is Deborah Arnott. She was appointed Honorary Associate Professor in the Division of Epidemiology and Public Health University of Nottingham in 2011 and won the 2007 Alwyn Smith Prize awarded annually by the UK [[Faculty of Public Health]] to the person judged to have made the most outstanding contribution to the health of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty prizes|url=http://www.fph.org.uk/faculty_prizes|website=fph.org.uk|publisher=[[Faculty of Public Health]]|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funding ===
ASH is a charity&lt;ref name="Charity commission"/&gt; describing itself as a "campaigning public health charity that works to eliminate the harm caused by tobacco".

Its funding for its core campaigning programme comes from the [[British Heart Foundation]] (BHF) and [[Cancer Research UK]] (CRUK). It has also received funding from the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] under its Section 64 grant programme, which is earmarked for specific projects to further the department’s public health objectives, and cannot be used to [[lobbying|lobby]] the government.&lt;ref name="ASH website"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_808.pdf| publisher=ASH/Kingston Smith| title=2011 Accounts| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818093254/http://ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_808.pdf| archivedate=18 August 2014| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Campaigns ===
ASH uses funding from the BHF and CRUK to influence policy on a variety of issues including taxation and smuggling, health inequalities, harm reduction, and smoking and young people. It also works to raise awareness of the methods used by the tobacco industry to influence public health policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tobacco front groups &amp; third party lobbying tactics|url=http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_835.pdf|website=ash.org.uk|accessdate=24 June 2015|date=January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421011640/http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_835.pdf|archivedate=21 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hammond|first1=Ross|last2=Rowell|first2=Andy|title=Trust us: We're the tobacco industry|url=http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_135.pdf|publisher=Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, Action on Smoking and Health|accessdate=24 June 2015|date=May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASH coordinates the Smokefree Action Coalition (SFAC), the umbrella group for organisations working to reduce the harm caused by tobacco, which was set up to campaign for comprehensive smoke-free legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Smokefree Action|url=http://www.smokefreeaction.org.uk/about.html|publisher=Smokefree Action Coalition|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, ASH won its campaign for legislation which created comprehensive [[Smoking ban in England|smoke-free indoor workplace regulation]], introduced in England on 1 July 2007.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6196910.stm | title=England smoke ban to start 1 July | publisher=BBC | date=2006-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ashjul07"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ash.org.uk/html/press/061201.html |publisher=ASH |accessdate=2006-12-01 |title=England to go smokefree on 1 July 2007: truly a time for celebration }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The smoke-free regulations included all pubs, bars and private members' clubs, as well as cafés, restaurants, and enclosed workplaces. A similar smoke-free law had already come into force in Scotland in March 2006,&lt;ref name="bbcscot"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3996587.stm | publisher=BBC | title=Scotland smoking ban to go ahead | date=2006-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Northern Ireland]] and Wales followed in April 2007. Campaigning after this point focussed on the need for a new government strategy on tobacco control.

In 2008, ten years after the publication of "Smoking Kills", a [[white paper]] on tobacco&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Smoking Kills: A White Paper on Tobacco.|date=1998|publisher=[[The Stationery Office|Stationery Office]]|location=London|isbn=9780101417723|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/260754/4177.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first comprehensive strategy to tackle the issue, ASH published "Beyond Smoking Kills" which provided a review of progress on the control of tobacco.&lt;ref name="Beyond Smoking Kills"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ash.org.uk/current-policy-issues/beyond-smoking-kills |title=Beyond Smoking Kills |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=ash.org.uk |publisher= |access-date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report called for a number of measures including a [[tobacco display ban]],&lt;ref name="Boseley 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boseley|first1=Sarah|title=Public health group calls for levy on tobacco firms to help fight smoking|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/10/public-health-group-calls-for-levy-on-tobacco-firms-to-help-fight-smoking|accessdate=24 June 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tobacco display ban extended to all shops|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32188988|accessdate=24 June 2015|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibition of the sale of tobacco from vending machines and [[plain tobacco packaging|standardised tobacco packaging]].&lt;ref name="Beyond Smoking Kills PDF"&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond Smoking Kills: Protecting children, reducing inequalities|date=October 2008|publisher=Action on Smoking and Health|isbn=978-1-872428-79-6|url=http://ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_691.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Health Act 2009]] provides for removal of [[cigarette machine|vending machines for tobacco products]] (implemented in October 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cigarette vending machines banned in England|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15132529|accessdate=24 June 2015|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and for the prohibition of the display of tobacco products at the point of sale in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In March 2011, the Government committed to implement the point of sale legislation in England in large shops from April 2012 and in smaller shops from April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Lives, Healthy People: A Tobacco Control Plan for England|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213757/dh_124960.pdf|publisher=[[Government of the United Kingdom|HM Government]]|accessdate=24 June 2015|date=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also committed to a public consultation on standardised packaging in early 2012. ASH, and the SFAC, actively campaigned for the introduction of standardised packaging, which was included in the [[Children and Families Act 2014]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perraudin|first1=Frances|title=MPs pass legislation to introduce standardised cigarette packaging|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/11/mps-pass-legislation-introduce-standardised-cigarette-packaging|accessdate=24 June 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was passed into law in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standardised tobacco packaging|url=http://ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_877.pdf|website=ash.org.uk|accessdate=24 June 2015|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charity described it as the "most important public health reform of this Parliament."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Triggle|first1=Nick|title=MPs back standardised cigarette packaging|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-31839859|accessdate=24 June 2015|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ASH published "Smoking Still Kills" which called for a new government tobacco control strategy, and made a number of recommendations including an annual levy on tobacco companies to fund measures to help smokers quit and prevent youth uptake.&lt;ref name="Smoking Still Kills"&gt;{{cite book|title=Smoking Still Kills: Protecting children, reducing inequalities|date=June 2015|publisher=Action on Smoking and Health|isbn=978-1-872428-95-6|url=http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_962.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the launch of the report, [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Public Health]] [[Jane Ellison]] committed to a new tobacco control strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Smoking Still Kills: Government announced key recommendation: a new tobacco control strategy |url=http://www.ash.org.uk/media-room/press-releases/:smoking-still-kills-government-announced-key-recommendation-a-new-tobacco-control-strategy |location= |publisher=Action on Smoking and Health |agency= |date=10 June 2015 |access-date=24 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613005113/http://www.ash.org.uk/media-room/press-releases/%3Asmoking-still-kills-government-announced-key-recommendation-a-new-tobacco-control-strategy |archivedate=13 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Snowdon]], a research fellow at the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], which had received funding from tobacco firms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doward|first1=Jamie|title=Health groups dismayed by news 'big tobacco' funded rightwing thinktanks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/01/thinktanks-big-tobacco-funds-smoking|accessdate=24 June 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted the influence of the charity saying that the "manifesto of this tiny pressure group is, in effect, the manifesto of whichever party is in power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Snowdon |first=Christopher |author-link=Christopher Snowdon |date=1 June 2015 |title=The anti-smoking pressure group whose wackiest ideas always become law |url=http://health.spectator.co.uk/the-anti-smoking-pressure-group-whose-wackiest-ideas-always-become-law/ |journal=[[The Spectator]] |location= |publisher= |access-date=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASH is also a member of the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[Framework Convention Alliance]] on [[Tobacco Control]].

==== Membership ====
ASH covers the whole of the UK and encourages supporters to get involved in the organisation's work, or just lend financial support. ASH Northern Ireland, ASH Scotland and ASH Wales are separate organisations.

===ASH Scotland===
ASH Scotland is an independent Scottish charity which aims to take action to reduce the harm caused by tobacco. First founded under the auspices of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] in 1973, ASH Scotland became a wholly separate charity in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our history|url=http://www.ashscotland.org.uk/about-us/our-history/|website=ASH Scotland|publisher=ASH Scotland|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation seeks to improve health and quality of life by limiting the number of young people taking up smoking, reducing the number of adult smokers, protecting people from second-hand smoke and tackling the inequality resulting from tobacco use. This involves campaigning for change in the law, providing information to politicians, healthcare professionals and the public, and running programmes designed to help people be tobacco-free.

Following ASH Scotland campaigns, Scotland was the first part of the UK to introduce [[List of smoking bans#Scotland|smoke-free public places legislation]] and the first part of the UK (and the third country globally) to declare a tobacco-free date (2034) as part of the Scottish Government's tobacco control strategy 'Creating a tobacco-free generation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creating a Tobacco-free Generation|url=http://www.gov.scot/resource/0041/00417331.pdf|website=Scottish Government|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ASH Wales===
ASH Wales is a smoking cessation and health charity that began in 1976  as an autonomous branch of ASH UK, and later granted independent charity status in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/charity-commission|title = ASH Wales Limited|date = |access-date = 12 February 2016|website = Charity Commission|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim is to reduce the prevalence of smoking across Wales by identifying and addressing influential factors, increasing public awareness, and improving the quality and reach of cessation services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ashwales.org.uk/en/about|title = About us|date = |access-date = 12 February 2016|website = ASH Wales|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASH Wales engages in a variety of projects including campaigning for tobacco-control public-health policy, research, training, educational workshops, advocacy, and support.

==== Campaigns ====
From 2012 onward ASH Wales campaigned for all 22 local authorities in Wales to introduce smoke-free policies in their children’s playgrounds. To date, 20 out of 22 local authorities have implemented voluntary bans in their local playgrounds, with another currently in the process of implementing a ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ashwales.org.uk/en/information-resources/topics/smokefree-playgrounds|title = Smoke-free playgrounds|date = |access-date = 12 February 2016|website = ASH Wales|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASH Wales played an instrumental role in the Welsh Government’s decision to enforce a ban on smoking in cars with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-32958077|title = Smoking ban in cars carrying children passed by assembly|date = |access-date = 12 February 2016|website = BBC News|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking in a private vehicle when someone under the age of 18 is present became illegal in England and Wales on 1 October 2015.

==== The Filter Project ====
The Filter is the youth project of ASH Wales which delivers quit smoking support and prevention for children and young people aged 11–25.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ASH Wales Cymru|url = http://ashwales.org.uk/en/about/our-youth-project|website = ASH Wales Cymru|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Filter provides workshops and quit smoking programmes delivered by smoking cessation advisors.

The Filter Project was launched in 2013 as a result of funding from the [[Big Lottery Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Child smoking: Ash Wales given £850,000 Lottery funding to help young quit|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-18022123|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then The Filter has delivered its workshops and cessation support to more than 6,000 people across Wales. From 2015 The Filter became part of an Erasmus+ funded partnership bringing together organisations from 5 different EU countries with the aim of reducing tobacco consumption across all of the nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ASH Wales Cymru|url = http://ashwales.org.uk/en/whats-new/erasmus-comes-to-wales|website = ASH Wales Cymru|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partnership will examine the potential of The Filter to work on a transnational basis.

==== Wales Tobacco or Health Network ====
The Wales Tobacco or Health Network (WTHN) is a professional network led by ASH Wales for individuals in Wales with an interest in tobacco and its impact on public health. It focuses on smoking and tobacco control but also on wider issues of health and well being such as the links between wealth and health inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ASH Wales Cymru|url = http://ashwales.org.uk/en/get-involved/professional-networks/wales-tobacco-or-health-network|website = ASH Wales Cymru|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network contains both individuals and organisations with members from many sectors, including academia, the tobacco control community, education, government, healthcare, local government, the media, the NHS, public health, and the private and voluntary sectors.

==== Wales Tobacco Control Alliance ====
The Wales Tobacco Control Alliance (WTCA) is a network managed by ASH Wales to enable all third sector and professional organisations involved with tackling tobacco in Wales to inform and influence policy development and implementation. The WTCA came together to campaign for a comprehensive Tobacco Control Strategy for Wales and now work to monitor this plan and reduce the harm caused by tobacco use more generally. Since 2008 over 30 organisations have joined the WTCA. This includes other charities like Cancer Research UK, the British Heart Foundation, along with professional bodies such as the Royal College of Physicians and the British Medical Association.

Following a campaign by the WTCA the Welsh Government published its Tobacco Control Action Plan in February 2012 which set out a comprehensive strategy containing ambitions to reduce adult smoking prevalence to 16% by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Smoking ban: ASH calls for more legislation to cut adult rates|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-22567778|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bio Products Laboratory''' (BPL) is a company involved in the manufacture of human [[blood plasma]] products, located in [[Elstree]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is owned by the Creat Group, a Chinese investment firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baincapital.com/news/creat-group-corporation-agrees-acquire-bio-products-laboratory-ltd | title=Creat Group Corporation agrees to acquire Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. | publisher=Bain Capital |date=18 May 2016 |accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before August 2016, it had been owned by [[Bain Capital]] (80%) and the [[UK Government]] (20%) via holding company Plasma Resources UK Ltd. BPL is run as a commercial business and supplies plasma derived products to the [[National Health Service]] in the UK as well as to markets in 45 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bpl.co.uk/about-bpl/|title = About BPL|accessdate = 21 October 2015|publisher = Bio Products Laboratory}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Blood Products Laboratory was established in 1954 as part of the [[Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine]] by the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]]. Lister purchased the Elstree site in 1902 and operated on the site until 1978.

During this time, Professor R. A.Kekwick, working at the Lister Institute undertook experimental and production work with A.S. McFarlane. The two scientists devised a process to clarify outdated blood plasma to render it suitable for transfusion. Laboratory testing was undertaken in the historic Queensbury Lodge, the site of Joseph Lister's laboratory.

In 1943, Kekwick was appointed Head of the Lister's Biophysics Division, Kekiwick established the Blood Filtration Unit and he and his team worked on methods of freeze-drying plasma and then of separating out proteins in blood plasma. These early products were used tomeet the needs of the Armed Services and civilian establishments. In 1948 the Blood Filtration Unit came under the joint management of the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Lister Institute, and the name was changed to the Blood Products Research Unit and it occupied the newly built laboratories (or ‘Building 25’). The aim of the Unit was directed towards the preparation of plasma fractions for clinical use

During the 1940s, Brinkhous and McFarlane discovered that transfusions using whole blood or plasma provided a means of FVIII replacement. Applications using this early discover were limited due to naturally low concentrations of this anti-haemophilic factor in blood and plasma and volume constraints in the circulatory system.

In 1954, the Government wished to establish a site for increased production of blood products. This followed on from the importance of blood in therapeutic medicine, the need for  blood products during the Second World War (particularly the use of albumin) and the formation on 26 September 1946 of the National Blood Transfusion Service. It had also been discovered that a second form of haemophilia (Haemophilia B) existed, which was treatable with blood protein called Factor IX. An agreement was reached between the Government, MRC and the Lister Institute and the Blood Products Laboratory was established with funding from the Ministry of Health. Enlarged facilities for plasma fractionation and freeze-drying were established.

During the 1970s and 1980s it became apparent that Factor VIII products produced at the BPL site (and other products from other companies) had infected haemophiliacs with life-threatening viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report: Chapter 19 - Production of Blood Products - Facilities|url=http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/finalreport/text/354876_chapter_19.html|website=www.penroseinquiry.org.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wheeler|first1=Caroline|title=Sick children infected with HIV and used as guinea pigs as NHS said chimps 'too expensive'|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/600114/Children-were-cheap-guinea-pigs-deadly-tainted-blood-products|website=Express.co.uk|language=en|date=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 it was renamed the Bio Products Laboratory to reflect the internal market in the National Health Service and in 1993 it became part of the [[National Blood Authority]]. BPL began cross-charging NHS hospitals for its products and limited competition in the international blood plasma market was permitted.

In 1998 the BPL began sourcing its plasma from the [[United States]] due to concerns over [[vCJD]] in the UK. In 2002 the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] (DoH) formed [[DCI Biologicals Inc]] to purchase US company [[Life Resources Inc]] to supply all of the BPL's plasma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2582389.stm|title = UK buys 'safe' blood supply for NHS|publisher = BBC News|date = 17 December 2002|work = BBC News World Edition|access-date = 21 October 2015|last = Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BPL became an operating division within new [[Special Health Authority]], [[NHS Blood and Transplant]], in 2005. This placed BPL alongside the National Blood Service and the organ transplant division, a strategic partnership to safeguard blood, tissues and blood products.

On 31 December 2010 the BPL was vested into a limited company, Bio Products Laboratory Ltd, and ownership transferred to the DoH, with BPL Ltd and DCI Biologicals Inc brought under the same DoH holding company, Plasma Resources UK Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.bpl.co.uk/about-bpl/news/q/date/2011/01/05/transfer-of-bio-products-laboratory-to-limited-co/|title = Transfer of Bio Products Laboratory to Limited Co|publisher = Bio Products Laboratory|date = 5 January 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110808131625/http://www.bpl.co.uk/about-bpl/news/q/date/2011/01/05/transfer-of-bio-products-laboratory-to-limited-co/|archive-date=8 August 2011 }}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July 2013 it was announced by Business Secretary Vince Cable that [[Bain Capital]] had bought 80% of Plasma Resources UK (PRUK) from the DoH for £230m, which included both BPL and DCI Biologicals. The company was subsequently renamed BPL Holdings, with the original BPL site now called BPL Therapeutics and DCI named BPL Plasma. In July 2016, Bain Capital sold BPL Holdings to Creat, a Chinese-based investment company who part own a Chinese plasma fractionator. In 2018, Creat announced plans to integrate BPL with the German plasma products manufacturer Biotest.

'''Bullous keratopathy''' is a pathological condition in which small vesicles, or ''[[Bulla (dermatology)|bullae]]'', are formed in the [[cornea]] due to [[corneal endothelium|endothelial]] dysfunction.

In a healthy cornea, endothelial cells keeps the tissue from excess fluid absorption, pumping it back into the aqueous humor. When affected by some reason, such as [[Fuchs' dystrophy]] or a trauma during cataract removal, endothelial cells suffer mortality or damage.&lt;ref name="Stuart"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stuart AJ, Virgili G, Shortt AJ |title= Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty versus Descemet's stripping automated  endothelial keratoplasty for corneal endothelial failure |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume= |issue=3|pages= CD012097 |date=2016 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012097/pdf |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD012097}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corneal endothelial cells normally do not undergo mitotic cell division, and cell loss results in permanent loss of function. When endothelial cell counts drop too low, the pump starts failing to function and fluid moves anterior into the stroma and epithelium. The excess fluid precipitates swelling of the cornea. As fluid accumulates between the basal epithelium cells, blister like formations form (bullae) and they undergo painful ruptures releasing their fluid content to the surface. These characteristic malformations disrupt vision and create pain sensations.

==Symptoms==
Disease begins with vesicles that coalesce. There is severe progressing edema and rupture may occur in 24 hours or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyevet.ca/bullous.html|title=Eye Vet - Zigler Veterinary Professional Corporation|website=Eyevet.ca|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bullous keratopathy
==Treatment==

Treatment can include hyperosmotic eye drops to reduce swelling (5% sodium chloride), bandage contact lenses to reduce discomfort, glaucoma medications to reduce the flow of fluid into the cornea, and surgical procedures to replace the damaged tissue. The most common types of surgical treatment are Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) and Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK).&lt;ref name="Stuart"/&gt;

==Prognosis==
Keratopathy is common in older people. Keratopathy occurs after cataract surgery, its incidence has decreased since the advent of intraoperative viscoelastic agents that protect the endothelium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionforvisionusa.org/anatomy/2005/11/bullous-keratopathy-of-cornea.html|title=Ocular Pathology: Bullous Keratopathy of the Cornea|website=Missionforvisionusa.org|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Even though Sudan's legal systems have been drawn from various other jurisdictions, [[capital punishment]] has always existed in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Inter Press Service. Death Penalty: Sudan Still Sentencing Minors to Death per Hamed Emam. http://www.ipsnews.net/2010/11/death-penalty-sudan-still-sentencing-minors-to-death/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last 100 years there have been a number of changes to Sudanese law. In the early 1900s until 1974 the death penalty was active in a legal system based on Indian criminal law, which in itself was influenced by Anglo-Saxon law.&lt;ref&gt;African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies. Widening the Scope: The Expanding Use of Capital Punishment in Law and Practice in Sudan. December 2010 at p 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, during President [[Gaafar Nimeiry| Gaafar Nimeiry's]] time in office, large scale amendments to the penal code were carried out which included some elements of civil law. However, the civil law amendments were never integrated into the Sudanese penal code which caused a number limitations for the courts.&lt;ref&gt;African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies. Widening the Scope: The Expanding Use of Capital Punishment in Law and Practice in Sudan. December 2010 at p 2&lt;/ref&gt; After this failure the previous Indian influenced penal law was reinstated. The basis of the legal system continued its yoyo pattern when in 1983 the Nimeiry regime sought to promote the [[Muslim Brotherhood|Muslim Brotherhood's]] version of Sharia law. Nimeiry's office revised a number of national laws to reflect this, including the penal code, only to have it repealed two years later and the 1974 criminal code restored once more.&lt;ref&gt;African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies. Widening the Scope: The Expanding Use of Capital Punishment in Law and Practice in Sudan. December 2010 at p 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 the 1974 penal code was replaced for a second time by the 1991 Criminal Code which is still in use today. By this time President [[Omar Al-Bashir]] had come to power after a 1989 coup, led by the fundamentalist [[National Islamic Front]] (NIF).&lt;ref&gt;US Department of State, Country Report on Human Rights Practices, Sudan. http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41628.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The reformations made by the Al-Bashir government helped to promote Islamisation in the country.

Though the identifier "criminal code" was chosen over "penal code" due to the fact the new laws included provisions which would promote care and rehabilitation, the government had no plans to follow growing international opinion against the death penalty and, to the contrary, further entrenched the practice. Rather than begin to draw back, the scope of the application of the penalty has expanded since the introduction of the code. 
In the most recent periodic report of the government of Sudan to the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights it states that Sudan sees no reason to abolish the death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;The 4th and 5th Periodic Reports of the Republic of the Sudan in Accordance with Article 62 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights 2008 – 2012. http://www.achpr.org/files/sessions/51st/state-reports/4thand5th-2008-2012/staterep4and5_sudan_2012_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==

===Crimes that attract capital punishment===
* Crimes against the state such as espionage, instigation of war against the state and undermining constitutional order.&lt;ref&gt;1991 Criminal Act, chapter 5, art 50-53.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Religious crimes. Muslims are prohibited from changing their religion ([[apostasy]]).
* Crimes against body and soul. This includes murder and the instigation of a minor to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;1991 Criminal Act, chapter 14, art 130, 134.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Crimes of honour, public morality and reputation. This includes; [[adultery]] (which is punishable by [[stoning]]),&lt;ref&gt;1991 Criminal Act, chapter 15, art 146(1)(a).&lt;/ref&gt; [[sodomy]],&lt;ref&gt;1991 Criminal Act, chapter 15, art 148(2)(c)&lt;/ref&gt; rape if it also constitutes adultery or sodomy,&lt;ref&gt;1991 Criminal Act, chapter 15, art 149(3)&lt;/ref&gt; incest&lt;ref&gt;1991 Criminal Act, chapter 15, art 150&lt;/ref&gt; and prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;1991 Criminal Act, chapter 15, art 155(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Article (27)(1) of the 1991 Act states that:

''execution is either by hanging or stoning or in the same manner as the commitment of murder by the perpetrator, and may be as a [[hudud]] punishment or in retribution or approximation, and may be with crucifixion
''

Generally, however, the punishment is executed by hanging.&lt;ref&gt;African Centre for Justice and Peace. Widening the Scope: The Expanding Use of Capital Punishment in Law and Practice in Sudan. December 2010 at p 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital punishment in practice==

===Procedural guarantees===
For a person charged with a capital crime in Sudan there are a number of procedural guarantees they should receive:
*Innocent until proven guilty
*The person charged with the offence should not be forced to self incriminate or be made to take any oaths except under limited circumstances. 
*There is a right to appeal
*The person charged has the right to medical care, to be safe from harm and to be able to contact a lawyer and their family
*Bail. However Article 106 (1) states that "the detained for crimes punishable with the death penalty or an amputation shall not be released".

These guarantees are only available at trial stage meaning that during the investigation period individuals may be dangerously exposed, particularly because torture (though illegal under Sudanese law) has been documented on numerous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies, Widening the Scope: The Expanding Use of Capital Punishment and Law in Sudan, December 2010 at p 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==
The following cases demonstrate the kinds of actions that have led to recent episodes of capital punishment in the country. 
Although Sudan is a signatory to the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|U.N Convention on the Rights of the Child]][http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx] until an amendment made in 2010, Sudan was still one of the few remaining countries whose death penalty extended to juveniles. One of the last juveniles to be killed by death penalty was Abdulrahman Zakaria Mohammed in May 2009. He had been found guilty of murder and robbery. The decision was decided based on two factors, as confirmed by the UN Special Rapporteur on independence of judges and lawyers; firstly, the prohibition of the death penalty for children did not extend to [[hudud]] offences, and secondly the Court believed that because the definition of 'adult' in the Criminal Act was "any person whose puberty has been established by definite natural features and who has completed 15 years of age and whoever obtains 18 years of age shall be deemed an adult even if the features of puberty do not exist". Using this definition of adult, the Court determined that Abdulrahman could be treated as an adult, even though he was only 17 at the time he was arrested. Also in 2009, four children between the ages of 15 to 17 were sentenced to death after being found guilty of armed robbery. 
In 2007 two young women in their early 20s were sentenced to death by stoning for committing adultery under Article 146 (a) of the Criminal Act. The woman did not have legal representation nor assistance to help defend themselves.&lt;ref&gt;African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies, Widening the Scope: The Expanding Use of Capital Punishment and Law in Sudan, December 2010 at p 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism== 
Criticism of capital punishment in Sudan usually centers on two rights protections: the protection to the right to life and the protection against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. These rights are both recognized in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights]].

There are a number of human rights violations that occur because of Sudanese law. For example, Article 126 (2) of the 1991 Criminal Act, which stipulates religious crimes that may result in capital sentencing, is a violation of the right to freedom of conscience and religious creed.

Also, though the procedural guarantees are consistent with international standards, they are limited in practice and the lack of access to bail is evidence of this. Sima Samar, the [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] for Human Rights in Sudan has noted in the past that the lack of sufficient guarantees of a fair trial for the accused facing the death penalty demonstrates serious doubts about compliance.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Sudan, Sima Samar to the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN.4/2006/111, 11 January 2006 at para 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical cases==
[[St. Teresa of Avila]] experienced a prolonged bout of catalepsy that began in 1539.  This episode was precipitated by the stress she was suffering at the Carmelite Convent of the Incarnation. Her legs became rigid, leaving her an invalid for three years. Teresa endured intermittent attacks of catalepsy from then on.&lt;ref&gt;St. Teresa of Avila, ''The Life of St. Teresa de Avila, 1565, chapters V, VI, and VII.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic depictions==
In the arts, catalepsy is often used for [[drama]]tic effect, sometimes as a [[plot device]].

===In literature===
In [[Alexandre Dumas, père]]'s novel ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', the Abbé Faria has fits of catalepsy from time to time, before eventually dying from one.

In [[Eugène Sue]]'s ''[[The Mysteries of Paris]]'', the villain Jacques Ferrand experiences a fit described as cataleptic in his final confrontation with Rodolphe, blinded by lamplight and hallucinating with visions of his fantasized Cecily.

In [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[Silas Marner]]'', the main character Silas Marner frequently has cataleptic fits and seizures. It is not mentioned if they are caused by any of the aforementioned factors.

In [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s "[[The Adventure of the Resident Patient]]", a man feigns catalepsy to gain access to a neurologist's rooms; the doctor attempts to treat him with [[amyl nitrite]].

In [[Ford Madox Ford]]'s ''[[The Good Soldier]]'', the protagonist Dowell experiences catalepsy following the death of his wife.

In [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', the main character Valentine Michael Smith is believed to have catalepsy when he is returned to Earth.

In [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Premature Burial]]", the narrator develops catalepsy. He fears being mistakenly declared dead and buried alive, and goes to great lengths to prevent this. In another of Poe's short stories, "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]", Madeline Usher has catalepsy, and is buried alive by her unstable brother Roderick. Catalepsy is also depicted in "[[Berenice (short story)|Berenice]]", thus becoming one of the recurrent themes in Poe's fiction.

In [[Poppy Z. Brite]]'s ''[[Exquisite Corpse (novel)|Exquisite Corpse]]'', the main character—Comptom, a serial killer (recreation of [[Jeffery Dahmer]]'s life story) facing a lifetime sentence—uses shamanistic techniques to induce catalepsy, and, convincingly appearing deceased, is able to escape prison.

In [[Émile Zola]]'s short story "[[La Mort d'Olivier Becaille]]" ("The Death of Olivier Becaille"), the title character is buried alive and notes that "I must have fallen into one of those cataleptic states that I had read of".

In [[Sax Rohmer]]'s [[Fu Manchu]] novels, Dr. Fu-Manchu has a serum that induces a state of catalepsy so extreme as to be indistinguishable from death.

In [[Charles Dickens]]'s novel ''[[Bleak House]]'', Mrs. Snagsby has violent spasms before becoming cataleptic and being carried upstairs like a grand piano.

In [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy: Greek Philosophy to Plato'', Hegel describes [[Socrates]] as having catalepsy caused by [[magnetic somnambulism]] when in deep meditation.

In [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams]]'s novel ''[[Many Dimensions]]'', Sir Giles Tumulty says to Lord Arglay, the Chief Justice of England: "You are a louse-brained catalept, Arglay."

In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Now Wait for Last Year]]'', Kathy Sweetscent becomes immobilized by withdrawal from JJ-180, an alien (and highly addictive) drug. "My God, Kathy thought as she stood gazing down at the record by her feet. I can't free myself; I'm going to remain here, and they'll find me like this and know something's terribly wrong. This is catalepsy!"

In the second chapter of [[Álvares de Azevedo]]'s ''[[Noite na Taverna]]'', character Solfieri rescues a woman who has catalepsy from inside a coffin.

===In film and television===

In [[Sam Taylor (director)|Sam Taylor]]'s ''[[Kiki (1931 film)|Kiki]]'' (1931), [[Mary Pickford]] feigns a case of catalepsy to keep from being removed from the apartment of the man she secretly loves.

In the soap opera ''[[La Traición]]'', the main character, Hugo De Medina, has catalepsy. Later in the telenovela, it is revealed that his daughter, Aurora, has the same illness.

In ''[[Chavo del Ocho]]'', the main character, El Chavo, would have cataleptic-like seizures if frightened, where he would curl as if sitting down in a chair and become stiff. However, he could be healed by being splashed with water.

In the 1965 [[Roman Polanski]] film ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'', [[Catherine Deneuve]]'s character shows signs of the condition through her erratic and unexplainable behavior.

In two ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episodes, "[[Statistical Probabilities]]" and "[[Chrysalis (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Chrysalis]]", the character Sarina Douglas, a genetically-enhanced human woman, exhibits cataleptic symptoms.  In "Chrysalis", [[Julian Bashir|Dr. Bashir]] promises to do everything he can to cure her of the disorder, and is ultimately successful.

In ''[[The Premature Burial (film)]]'' based on the short story by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], the protagonist is buried alive during a cataleptic episode, as his lack of response to external stimuli causes his family and doctors to believe him to be dead.

In ''[[The Fisher King]]'' (1991), [[Robin Williams]]' character Parry has this condition after witnessing the brutal murder of his wife.

In ''[[Isle of the Dead (film)|Isle of the Dead]]'' (1945), Katherine Emery's character suffers from a multitude of illness' that render her almost incapable of caring for herself. Of these many illness' she is subject to catatonic trances which inevitably lead to her demise.

In a second-season episode ("Halloween" - 1993) of [[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman|Doctor Quinn, Medicine Woman]], several residents of the town believe they have seen a dead man, only to have him disappear before they return with Dr. Quinn, who thinks they are playing Halloween pranks on her.  Dr Quinn eventually sees the man have a seizure and diagnoses him with catalepsy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3139">'''Charles Basch''' is the Richard March Hoe Professor of Health and Education at [[Teachers College, Columbia University]], [[New York City, New York]]. He teaches courses related to epidemiology, planning and evaluation. Before coming to Teachers College, he was Assistant Professor of Community Health Education at [[Russell Sage College]] in [[Troy, New York]].

He earned his B.S. and M.S. in community health education at the [[State University of New York at Brockport]] and his Ph.D. in health education at [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]], where he studied under four of the field's most prominent leaders, [[Robert S. Gold]], [[David F. Duncan]], [[Elena Sliepcevich]], and [[Robert Russell (health education)|Robert Russell]].

Basch's main scholarly interests are improving understanding of (1) health-related decision making, (2) dissemination and implementation of effective health-related programs and policies, and (3) the influence of health factors on educational outcomes in urban minority youth. In particular, he has documented a link between childhood health and learning in school. His research identifies seven factors (poor vision, asthma, teen pregnancy, aggression and violence, physical inactivity, ADHD, and insufficient breakfast) that can and do lead to health disparities and contribute to poorer academic achievement. He notes that students will perform and learn better every day if they are "well-rested and well-nourished".  During his 25 years at Teachers College, he has directed approximately $15 million of grant-funded research and program development (primarily supported by the [[National Institutes of Health]]), and he continues to do so. His work has yielded over 100 scholarly publications.

'''Childbirth in Iraq''' is marked by a fertility rate of 4.0 births per woman, a contested but high maternal mortality rate and a moderately high infant mortality rate.

==Fertility rate==
In 2015 Iraq's fertility rate was reported by the [[World Health Organization]] at 4.0 births per woman.&lt;ref&gt;Iraq: WHO Statistical Profile. (January, 2015). Global Health Observatory. Retrieved on March 21st, 2015 at http://www.who.int/gho/countries/irq.pdf?ua=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mortality==
===Maternal mortality===
Maternal mortality is a much debated figure in Iraq. In 2010 the [[CIA World Factbook]] reported maternal mortality at 63 deaths/100,000 births.&lt;ref&gt;Middle East: Iraq. (2014, June 22). CIA World Factbook. Retrieved March 24, 2015, from https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.html&lt;/ref&gt; Iraq's Ministry of Health and the WHO reported in 2011 the maternal mortality rate at 84 death per 100,000 births. That would categorize Iraq as one of the 68 countries that account for 97% of the maternal and child deaths globally.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, P. C. (2013). Roots of Iraq's maternal and child health crisis run deep. The Lancet, 381(9870), 891-894.DOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60658-3&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the two organizations were divided on the issue with the WHO reporting maternal mortality at 64 deaths per 100,000 and Ministry of Health reporting 25.&lt;ref&gt;Al Hilfi, T. K., Lafta, R., &amp; Burnham, G. (2013). Health services in Iraq. The Lancet, 381(9870), 939-948. DOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60320-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infant mortality===
In 2014 total infant mortality in Iraq was reported 37.53 deaths/1,000 live births: male: 41.57 deaths/1,000 live births and female: 33.28 deaths/1,000 live births.&lt;ref&gt;Middle East: Iraq. (2014, June 22). CIA World Factbook. Retrieved March 24, 2015, from https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contraceptive use ==
In 2013, the World Health Organization reported the contraception use rate at 53% for the population of Iraq, up from 32.9% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Iraq: Country  statistics summary. (2013).

===Abortion===
In 2009, the United Nations reported that in Iraq abortion was only permitted to preserve a women’s life. It was not allowed in the case of rape or incest, to preserve a women’s physical or mental health, for economic or social reasons, or on request.&lt;ref&gt;World Abortion Policies 2011.

==Pregnancy care providers==
There are three types of pregnancy care providers in Iraq; midwives, obstetricians, and traditional birth attendants.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, L. (2007). Midwifery, Freedom to Practice?. Churchill Livingston, Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt; Midwives practice in hospitals and in their home or the home of their client.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, L. (2007). Midwifery, Freedom to Practice?. Churchill Livingston, Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt; They are educated in hospital based programs, but there is interest in expanding midwifery education to the university level.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, L. (2007). Midwifery, Freedom to Practice?.

==Prenatal care==
In 2006: 84% of women{{where|date=May 2015}} had at least one prenatal visit with skilled personnel.
Of the women who received antenatal care:
63% had a urine sample,
66% had a blood test, and
76% had their blood pressure taken.
A client's weight was taken less than the other measurements.&lt;ref&gt;Iraq: Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2006. (2007). Central Organization for Statistics &amp; Information Technology.

==Labor and birth==
===Location===
In 2011, 74% of recorded births in Iraq took place in a hospital or birth center, 79% of urban births and 67% of rural births.&lt;ref&gt;Iraq Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2011 (2012) Retrieved at http://www.childinfo.org/files/MICS4_Iraq_PreliminaryReport_Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Midwifery, Freedom to Practice?. Churchill Livingston, Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pain and pain management===
Women in Iraq generally expect that there will be pain with labor and delivery. An absence of pain is often interpreted as a poor progress in labor. Epidurals are not commonly used in public hospitals in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, L. (2007). Freedom to Practise?: An International Exploration and Examination of Midwifery Practice. Philadelphia, PA.

==History==
The test was first called the "Verbal Associative Fluency Test", and then was changed to the "Controlled Word Association Test".&lt;ref name="Lezak1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Muriel Deutsch Lezak|title=Neuropsychological Assessment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kj-RO9NyCgkC&amp;pg=PA545|date=2 March 1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-509031-4|pages=545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
The participant is usually asked to name words beginning with a letter, excluding [[proper nouns]], for one minute and this procedure is repeated three times. The most commons letters used are FAS because of their frequency in the English language.&lt;ref name="Semrud-ClikemanEllison2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret Semrud-Clikeman|author2=Phyllis Anne Teeter Ellison|title=Child Neuropsychology: Assessment and Interventions for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, 2nd Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBGSF9Jyg6AC&amp;pg=PA171|date=15 June 2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-88963-4|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The examiner must quickly write down the words provided by the participant on a piece of paper. The whole examination usually takes 5–10 minutes.

[[File:CrowdingDemo.gif|right|frame|A demonstration of the crowding effect. Fixate on the "x" and attempt to identify the central (or single) letter appearing to the right. The presence of flankers should make the task more difficult.]]
'''Crowding''' is a [[perception|perceptual]] phenomenon where the [[Cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition|recognition of objects]] (or graphemes) presented away from the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]] is impaired by the presence of other neighbouring objects (sometimes called "flankers").&lt;ref name=Levi&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levi D |title=Crowding - an essential bottleneck for object recognition: a mini-review |journal=Vision Research |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=635–654 |date=February 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.visres.2007.12.009 |pmid=18226828 |pmc=2268888}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that crowding occurs due to mandatory integration of the crowded objects by a [[Pattern recognition|texture-processing neural mechanism]].&lt;ref name=ParkesEtAl&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Parkes L |author2=Lund J |author3=Angelucci A |author4=Solomon JA |author5=Morgan M |title=Compulsory averaging of crowded orientation signals in human vision |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=4 |issue=7 |pages=739–744 |year=2001 |doi=10.1038/89532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowding deficits have been specifically found in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism and may have profound clinical implications in these disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kraehenmann|first=Rainer|author2=Vollenweider FX |author3=Seifritz E |author4=Kometer M |title=Crowding deficits in the visual periphery of schizophrenia patients|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=9|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0045884|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0045884 |pmid=23049884 |pages=e45884 |pmc=3458825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dokha''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: دوخة, literal translation "dizziness" or "vertigo") is an [[Arab world|Arabian]] [[tobacco product]], consisting of dried and finely shredded [[tobacco]] flakes mixed with [[Herb|herbs]] and [[Spice|spices]]. It originated in Iran during the 15th century. Unlike [[hookah]] tobacco (also called "shisha" or "[[Mu‘assel|mu'assel]]"), dokha is not cured with [[molasses]]. Users smoke the [[tobacco]] blend in small quantities using a pipe called a [[midwakh]]. Because the midwakh pipe is used almost exclusively for smoking dokha, the terms are often used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  

Dokha has a higher concentration of [[nicotine]] compared to other forms of tobacco&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;, and can cause brief periods of [[euphoria]], relaxation or [[lightheadedness]] in some users.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.albawaba.com/editorchoice/beirut-students-puff-dokha-dizziness-buzz-and-sensation-1131166|title=Beirut Students Puff 'Dokha' For Dizziness, Buzz and Sensation|last=|first=|date=2018-05-14|work=Al Bawaba|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As using the midwakh also reportedly leaves less lingering smells, and requires less tobacco to be used at a time, it can be used discreetly, which has made it popular among student populations and young adults.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5829996/|title=Vertigo|date=2018-11-18|last=Basheer|first=Diyab|type=Documentary, Short Film|language=en-US|publisher=Vertex Pictures|at=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra1RdNNx2vY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Expand section|section=1|more information with &lt;b&gt;authoritative sources&lt;/b&gt;|talksection=History section expansion|date=November 2018|small=yes}}Dokha tobacco and its derivatives have been cultivated and used in Middle Eastern countries for approximately 500 years. It originated in [[Iran]] during the [[15th century]], as use spread among sailors in the [[Caspian Sea]], which lead to it's eventual spread throughout all of the Middle East during the following centuries. Traditionally, dokha consists of dried and ground tobacco leaves, blended with herbs, spices, dried flowers and fruits. Depending on local traditions, bark and leaves of [[Native plant|native plants]] were also used.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vupputuri|first=S.|last2=Hajat|first2=C.|last3=Al-Houqani|first3=M.|last4=Osman|first4=O.|last5=Sreedharan|first5=J.|last6=Ali|first6=R.|last7=Crookes|first7=A.

Modern dokha maintains many of the characteristics of its traditional forms, consisting of tobacco and spices without any [[Preservative|preservatives]], [[Pesticide|pesticides]], [[Herbicide|herbicides]] or additives that are commonly used in mass-produced tobacco products. {{cn|date=November 2018}}

=== Preparation ===
Unlike most tobaccos, dokha is not fire cured and cut, but dried in the arid desert region from whence it was harvested. It is finely ground to preserve the strength, freshness and flavor of the tobacco.  Due to the lesser degree of processing, dokha tobacco appears essentially unaltered, maintaining the green color of the natural plant. The tobacco is then blended with other spices and herbs to create the final product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enjoy-dokha.co.uk/services/serviceswhat-is-dokha/|title=Dokha History - www.enjoy-dokha.co.uk|last=|first=|date=|website=www.enjoy-dokha.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126150841/https://www.enjoy-dokha.co.uk/services/serviceswhat-is-dokha/|archive-date=2018-11-26|dead-url=|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries where dokha is used, there are a number of available tobacco strengths (typically described in Arabic as "hot", "warm" or "cold"), which indicate the harshness of a particular blend.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Sale and regulation ==
{{See also|Smoking age}}
Dokha is regulated by most countries in the same manner as they would other tobacco products. 
=== United Arab Emirates ===
The UAE passed "Federal Law No. 15 regarding Tobacco Control" in December 2009, making the legal age to purchase tobacco (including dokha) 18 years old. The law also made smoking in cars (with children under 12 present), houses of worship, educational campuses and health/fitness centers, illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite act|title=القانون الاتحادي رقم 15 بشأن مكافحة التبغ|trans-title=Federal Law No. 15 Regarding Tobacco Control|type=Law|number=|date=29 December 2009|url=https://www.tobaccocontrollaws.org/files/live/United%20Arab%20Emirates/United%20Arab%20Emirates%20-%20Cabinet%20Decision%20No.%2012-2011%20-%20national.pdf|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law was expanded in 2012 by adopting [[GCC Standardization Organization|GSO]] standards that require [[tobacco packaging warning messages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite act|title=بطاقات عبوات منتجات التبغ|trans-title=Standard Specifications, Adopting GSO 246/2011 on Labeling of Tobacco Product Packages|type=Law|number=|date=9 August 2012|url=https://www.tobaccocontrollaws.org/files/live/United%20Arab%20Emirates/United%20Arab%20Emirates%20-%20UAE.S_GSO%202462011%20-%20national.pdf|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2015, the [[Dubai Municipality]] issued warnings to 40 dokha shops to obtain certificates of conformity from the UAE Authority for Standardization and Meteorology . The shops were required to discontinue the practices of allowing customers to sample dokha in the shop and cleaning their midwakh pipes for them in order to obtain these certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/uae/government/municipality-warns-40-dokha-stores-for-violation-1.1594168|title=Municipality warns 40 dokha stores for violation|last=Botros|first=Maria|date=2015-10-03|work=Gulf News|access-date=2018-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127125128/https://gulfnews.com/uae/government/municipality-warns-40-dokha-stores-for-violation-1.1594168|archive-date=2018-11-27|last2=Bedirian|first2=Razmig|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these efforts, there were still concerns from local leaders and health officials over shopkeepers illegally selling dokha and midwakh pipes to underage customers, and teenage use of tobacco continued to rise.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/it-s-all-too-easy-for-teens-to-buy-dokha-1.611273|title=It’s all too easy for teens to buy dokha|last=Al Ramahi|first=Nawal|date=2017-05-05|work=The National|access-date=2018-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126150529/https://www.thenational.ae/uae/it-s-all-too-easy-for-teens-to-buy-dokha-1.611273|archive-date=2018-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/health/teenage-smokers-on-rise-as-tobacco-law-is-flouted-1.518190|title=Teenage smokers on rise as tobacco law is flouted|work=The National|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An excise tax was introduced on October 1, 2017 on tobacco products in an effort to discourage their consumption. There was confusion among dokha users and retailers as to whether all dokha products, or only specific dokha brands, were subject to the excise tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/smokers-turn-to-dokha-as-sellers-are-yet-unsure-if-it-falls-under-excise-tax-regulations-1.664850|title=Smokers turn to dokha as sellers are yet unsure if it falls under excise tax regulations|last=Zacharias|first=Anne|date=2017-10-07|work=The National|access-date=2018-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127130406/https://www.thenational.ae/uae/health/uae-smoking-poll-only-one-in-four-have-changed-their-habit-since-introduction-of-sin-tax-1.714421|archive-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll the following year showed that one in four smokers said that the new tax changed their habit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/health/uae-smoking-poll-only-one-in-four-have-changed-their-habit-since-introduction-of-sin-tax-1.714421|title=UAE smoking poll: only one in four have changed their habit since introduction of 'sin tax'|last=Webster|first=Nick|date=2018-05-19|work=The National|access-date=2018-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127130406/https://www.thenational.ae/uae/health/uae-smoking-poll-only-one-in-four-have-changed-their-habit-since-introduction-of-sin-tax-1.714421|archive-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, new regulations were approved by the UAE's National Tobacco Control Programme by the Ministry of Health and Prevention. Intended to be in place by the end of the year, the regulations set purchase restrictions specifically on dokha products. They also ban the practice of bottling and refilling larger quantities at home or in shops, which has been the local custom, and require dokha product packaging to include pictorial warnings (the same way other types of tobacco products were required to have per the 2012 law).&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/dokha-sales-to-be-tightly-regulated-in-uae-|title=Dokha sales to be tightly regulated in UAE|last=Zain|first=Asma Ali|date=2018-05-31|work=Khaleej Times|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smoking ===
{{Tobacco}}Dokha is almost exclusively [[Smoking|smoked]] out of an elongated [[Smoking pipe|pipe]] called a [[midwakh]] (alternatively spelled 'medwakh'). The [[traditional]] midwakh has no [[Cigarette filter|filter]], but more recent variations contain a removable, stem-mounted filter. A small container called a chanta is sometimes used to store and dispense the tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kingdomdokha.com/faq/|title=Frequently Asked Questions|last=|first=|date=|work=Kingdom Dokha|access-date=2018-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123172735/https://kingdomdokha.com/faq/|archive-date=2018-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 0.5-1 grams of dokha tobacco is smoked at a time, and is usually smoked in about two inhalations. One study estimates that the typical daily user of dokha consumes approximately 6 grams, or 12 smoking sessions.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shemmari|first=Noora Al|last2=Shaikh|first2=Rizwana Burhanuddin|last3=Sreedharan|first3=Jayadevan|date=2015-02-25|title=Prevalence of Dokha Use among Secondary School Students in Ajman, United Arab Emirates|journal=Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention|volume=16|issue=2|pages=427–430|doi=10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.2.427|issn=1513-7368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassona|first=Y.|last2=Scully|first2=C.|date=2015-07-01|title=Dokha: an emerging smoking habit with possible oral effects|journal=Oral Diseases|volume=21|issue=5|pages=679–680|doi=10.1111/odi.12324|issn=1601-0825|pmid=25690423}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A preliminary study found dokha has significantly more nicotine than other tobacco products such as shisha or cigarettes.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahboub|first=Bassam|last2=Mohammad|first2=Ayesha Begum|last3=Nahlé|first3=Ayssar|last4=Vats|first4=Mayank|last5=Al Assaf|first5=Omar|last6=Al-Zarooni|first6=Hamdan|date=2018-09-01|title=Analytical Determination of Nicotine and Tar Levels in Various Dokha and Shisha Tobacco Products|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29750269|journal=Journal of Analytical Toxicology|volume=42|issue=7|pages=496–502|doi=10.1093/jat/bky029|issn=1945-2403|pmid=29750269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicotine produces various pharmacologic and psycho-dynamic effects in the brain within seconds, which generally last for 30 seconds to several minutes, depending on the user's nicotine [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]].

Users sometimes describe the sensation as 'dizziness', which is where dokha's name (meaning 'dizziness' or 'vertigo' in Arabic) is presumed to be derived.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Dokha does not traditionally contain other [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] substances, such as [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] or [[hashish]]. 

=== Prevalence ===
While dokha is not a relatively new alternative tobacco product, it's use has had a noted increase in the [[Middle East]], particularly in the UAE, and especially among males aged 20-39, during the 2000s and 2010s.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Houqani|first=Mohammed|last2=Ali|first2=Raghib|last3=Hajat|first3=Cother|date=2012-06-15|title=Tobacco Smoking Using Midwakh Is an Emerging Health Problem – Evidence from a Large Cross-Sectional Survey in the United Arab Emirates|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=7|issue=6|pages=e39189|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0039189|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3376102|pmid=22720071}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dentistryiq.com/articles/2015/03/tobacco-risks-and-prevention-what-is-dokha.html|title=Tobacco use: What is dokha?|last=Perno Goldie|first=Maria|date=March 10, 2015|website=www.dentistryiq.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts speculate this may be due to tobacco control efforts' exclusive focus on cigarette use, coupled with the fact that dokha and midwakh usage in these countries has become the second-most popular form of tobacco, after cigarettes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/news/uae-health/dokha-smoking-becoming-an-addiction-in-uae-say-experts|title=Dokha smoking becoming an addiction in UAE, say experts|last=Kuttab|first=Jasmine Al|date=2017-11-14|work=Khaleej Times|access-date=2018-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127125701/https://www.khaleejtimes.com/news/uae-health/dokha-smoking-becoming-an-addiction-in-uae-say-experts|archive-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Culminating in legislative efforts in 2009 and 2018, there has also been particular concern in the UAE that teenagers may be getting easier access to dokha tobacco when they are unable to obtain cigarettes, and that dokha has quickly become popular among young adults.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/uae/education/dubais-teenagers-take-to-dokha-1.1039067|title=Dubai’s teenagers take to ‘dokha’|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dokha's reported lack of lingering smells (compared to other forms of smoked tobacco) and the relatively smaller amount of material smoked in a given session, make it a convenient form of discreetly and quickly satisfying nicotine cravings, which has made dokha popular among underage smokers.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; One study assessing the prevalence of dokha smoking among secondary school students in the UAE found that 39% had ever smoked tobacco products, 36% had ever smoked dokha specifically, and 25% of them were now current users of dokha, which is very high compared to other forms of smoking.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shemmari|first=Noora Al|last2=Shaikh|first2=Rizwana Burhanuddin|last3=Sreedharan|first3=Jayadevan|date=2015-02-25|title=Prevalence of Dokha Use among Secondary School Students in Ajman, United Arab Emirates|journal=Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention|volume=16|issue=2|pages=427–430|doi=10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.2.427|issn=1513-7368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dokha use has seen some emergence in the [[Western world]], and some health officials speculate this may be due to immigration, globalized commerce, and internet sales, but such a trend has not been definitively studied or proven.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Retail companies specifically catering to dokha smokers can now be found in the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.devonlive.com/news/business/arabian-pipes-super-strength-tobacco-1827547|title=The Arabian pipes and super strength tobacco becoming a bestseller in Exeter|last=Finch|first=Hannah|date=2018-07-26|work=DevonLive|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enjoy-dokha.co.uk/services/who-we-are/|title=Who We Are - About Us - Enjoy Dokha Ltd|last=|first=|date=|website=Enjoy Dokha Ltd|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117135722/https://www.enjoy-dokha.co.uk/services/who-we-are/|archive-date=2018-11-17|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and more [[Tobacconist|tobacco shops]] in the UK are stocking dokha and midwakh accessories to fill a gap in the market, which some company representatives claim is driven by increased [[immigration]] from Middle Eastern countries.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4wb89p/uk-students-are-smoking-dokha|title=Getting to Grips with Dokha, the Super-Strength Tobacco Becoming Popular in Britain|date=2015-10-28|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some reports that dokha may be spreading in popularity in [[India]] due to one successful startup company offering the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thequint.com/news/india/why-are-so-many-young-indians-smoking-iranian-dokha|title=Why Are so Many Young Indians Smoking Iranian Dokha?|last=Rattanpal|first=Divyani|date=2016-02-23|work=The Quint|access-date=2018-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117141701/https://www.thequint.com/news/india/why-are-so-many-young-indians-smoking-iranian-dokha|archive-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/292901|title=A Conglomerate Of Conceptions|last=|first=|date=2017-04-15|work=Entrepreneur Magazine|access-date=2018-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117142620/https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/292901|archive-date=2018-11-17|publisher=Entrepreneur India|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Health effects ==
{{See also|Health effects of tobacco}}Personal accounts from users and marketing materials from dokha retailers claim that the relatively smaller amount of material smoked in a midwakh, or the lack of some additives in dokha, make it a less risky form of tobacco.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116024649/http://www.herbaltobacco.in/what-is-dokha.html|title=What is Dokha? {{!}} Herbal Tobacco Company|last=|first=|date=2018-11-16|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=2018-11-16|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Health professionals consider this a myth, that dokha is likely just as or more dangerous than other forms of smoking, and that more research is needed to investigate the adverse effects, as there is little comparative study between dokha and other tobacco products.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Chemical composition ===
[[File:Nicotine and Tar Levels in Dokha and Shisha Tobacco Products.png|thumb|544x544px|Nicotine and tar levels compared to other tobacco products, per a 2018 University of Sharjah study&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;]]
A February 2018 study called for further research into the harmful effects of dokha smoke after it found that three different types of dokha tested from the Middle East and North Africa region contained toxic metals comprising "22 irritants, 3 known [[Carcinogen|carcinogens]], 5 central nervous system [[depressants]], in addition to several other compounds with miscellaneous effects".&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-02-15|title=Chemical characterization and safety assessment of dokha: An emerging alternative tobacco product|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717326062|journal=Science of the Total Environment|language=en|volume=615|pages=9–14|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.255|pmid=28961439|issn=0048-9697|last1=Elsayed|first1=Yehya|last2=Dalibalta|first2=Sarah|last3=El Kouche|first3=Maissam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, a [[University of Sharjah]] study compared the nicotine and [[Tar (tobacco residue)|tar]] levels in dokha to other tobacco products, which found dokha had significantly higher levels of both. Nicotine in dokha was measured at 23.83-52.8 mg/g compared to 0.8-20.52 mg/g in shisha, and 0.5-19.5 mg/g in cigarettes. Tar in dokha was measured at 21.6-45.02 mg/g compared to 1.68-11.87 mg/g in shisha and 5-27 mg/g in cigarettes.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Acute effects ===
Few studies have been performed on the acute effects specific to dokha use, but one [[Observational study|uncontrolled study]] among male UAE medical university students assessed the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaikh|first=Rizwana B.|last2=Abdul Haque|first2=Noor Mohammad|last3=Abdul Hadi Khalil Al Mohsen|first3=Hassan|last4=Abdul Hadi Khalil Al Mohsen|first4=Ali|last5=Haitham Khalaf Humadi|first5=Marwa|last6=Zaki Al Mubarak|first6=Zainab|last7=Mathew|first7=Elsheba|last8=Al Sharbatti|first8=Shatha|date=2012-01-01|title=Acute effects of dokha smoking on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems among UAE male university students|journal=Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention: APJCP|volume=13|issue=5|pages=1819–1822|issn=1513-7368|pmid=22901128|doi=10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.5.1819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Increased systolic [[blood pressure]]
* Decreased diastolic blood pressure
* Increased [[heart rate]] and [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]

=== Chronic effects ===
As dokha consists of tobacco and other plant material, health officials suspect the health effects from prolonged use are similar or identical to that of other tobacco products, but as of 2018 there have been no clinical studies to identify the long-term risks specific to it.

One study concluded that oral lesions are a possible chronic side effect of irritation from the midwakh pipe.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Some of the health risks of chronic tobacco smoking in general, that have been identified, are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15670">The '''Emergency Medical Services for Children''' (EMSC) program is a [[United States of America|US federal government]] health initiative. It is administered by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]’ [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA), and the [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]] (MCHB). Its aim is to reduce child and youth [[disability]] and death due to severe [[illness]] or [[injury]] by increasing awareness among health professionals, provider and planners and the general public of the special ([[physiology|physiological]] and [[psychology|psychological]]) needs of children receiving emergency medical care.

==Background==
In the [[Korean War|Korean]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] wars, medical experience demonstrated that survival rates improved dramatically when patients were stabilized in the field and transported immediately to a well-equipped emergency facility.  During the 1960s, civilian medical and surgical communities recognized the possibility of applying this principle to an EMS system.

===Support===
In 1973, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the Emergency Medical Services Systems Act of 1973. Managed by the HRSA, it provided funding for more comprehensive state and local government EMS systems. Between 1975 and 1979, state EMS systems dramatically{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2014}} improved outcomes of adult patients but not those of pediatric patients. In 1979, [[Calvin C.J. Sia]], MD, then-president of the Hawaii Medical Association, requested that the members of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) develop EMS programs designed to decrease disability and death in children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aap.org/member/spotlight-sia.htm "Calvin Sia."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810031640/http://www.aap.org/member/spotlight-sia.htm |date=August 10, 2014 }} American Academy of Pediatrics website.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Sia was joined by José B. Lee, then-executive officer of the Hawaii Medical Association Emergency Medical Services Program in requesting that U.S. Senator Daniel K. Inouye introduce legislation to establish, implement and fund a national initiative designed to address emergency medical services for children systems development.  Soon after, [[Daniel Inouye|Senator Daniel Inouye]] (D-HI) responded to this request by introducing a legislative vehicle in the United States Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Gauche-Hill M. et al (ed.)[https://books.google.com/books?id=oDI8Rxe34U8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=Inouye "APLS:the Pediatric Emergency Medicine Resource."] American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Emergency Physicians.

Accessed 31 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His staff assistant and chief of staff [[Patrick DeLeon]]'s daughter was hospitalized with meningitis. The girl's treatment demonstrated the shortcomings of an average emergency department when treating a critically ill child.&lt;ref&gt;Clay R. [http://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/01/deleon.aspx "A Trailblazer Moves On."] Monitor on Psychology, January 2012, vol.43(1) p68. Accessed July 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Senators [[Orrin Hatch]](R-UT) and [[Lowell Weicker]](R-CT) also gave their support. In 1984, Congress enacted legislation (Public Law 98-555) authorizing the use of federal funds for emergency medical services for children (EMSC). By this law, and through the administration of the MCHB, the EMSC program obtained funds to improve the pediatric capabilities of existing emergency medical services systems. In 1985, Congress designated initial funding for the EMSC program and in 1986, the first federal grants were utilized in Alabama, California, New York, and Oregon.

==Federal program==
The federal EMSC program is designed to ensure that all children and adolescents receive appropriate{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2014}} care in a health emergency. Since 1985, the EMSC program has provided grants to all states, and the District of Columbia, five U.S. territories, and three Freely Associated States. Additional EMSC program funding has been used to establish national resource centers and a pediatric emergency care research network.&lt;ref&gt;Ball J. W.

! Grants and cooperative agreements funded by EMSC
! Description
|-
| State partnership (SP) grants
| State partnership grants fund activities to improve and integrate pediatric emergency care in a state EMS system. The typical applicant is a state government unless the state decides to delegate responsibility to an accredited school of medicine. Every grantee is required to collect and report data on program-defined performance measures.

|-
| Targeted issue (TI) grants
| Targeted issue grants are intended to address specific needs, concerns, or topics in pediatric emergency care that transcend state boundaries. Grantees are typically schools of medicine looking to find new approaches to providing the best possible emergency care for children across the nation. Typically, the projects result in new products or resources, or demonstrate the effectiveness of model system component(s) or service(s) of value.

|-
| State partnership regionalization of care (SPROC) grants
| The purpose of the SPROC grants is two-fold: (1) to continue its work with state governments and/or accredited schools of medicine to develop regionalized systems that encompass the sharing of resources and improve access to pediatric health care services for children and families in tribal, territorial, insular, and rural areas of the United States and (2) to develop "Models of Inclusive Care" that may be replicated in other regions where access to specialized pediatric medical treatment is limited due to geographical distances or jurisdictional borders.

|-
| Network development demonstration project (NDDP) cooperative agreements
| NDDP cooperative agreements demonstrate the value of an infrastructure or network that conducts multi-center investigations on the efficacy of treatment, transport, and care responses for children, including those preceding the arrival of children to hospital emergency departments. These cooperative agreements form the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). PECARN currently consists of six research node centers that work collaboratively with hospital emergency department affiliates to develop and submit nodal research proposals and conduct PECARN-approved research at their respective institutions. In 2013, PECARN added an EMS demonstration node.

|-
| EMSC data coordinating center (DCC)
| Following the inception of PECARN, a cooperative agreement was awarded to the University of Utah to serve as a central repository for data generated by each of the PECARN research nodes and their hospital affiliates.  The DCC also works with PECARN principal investigators to implement PECARN-wide standards for data collection and analysis in order to ensure uniformity and quality of the data and to monitor the safety and timely progress of PECARN studies.
|-
| National EMSC data analysis resource center (NEDARC)
| Funded through a cooperative agreement, NEDARC provides technical assistance to EMSC grantees and state EMS offices in the areas of data collection, data analysis, data communication, quality improvement, grant writing, and research design.

|-
| EMSC national resource center (EMSC NRC)
| Also funded through a cooperative agreement, the EMSC NRC focuses on dissemination and transfer of best practices in pediatric emergency care. This is accomplished by the following: identification of resources and model programs; development of interfacilty transfer guidelines/agreements and facility recognition; development of legislation and regulations; and dissemination and implementation of EMSC best practices.

==Program accountability==
To measure the effectiveness of federal grant programs, the HRSA requires grantees to report on specific performance measures related to their grant funded activities. The measures are part of the Government Performance Results Act (GPRA). In order to receive or continue to receive Program funds, all EMSC grantees must provide data on measures 71 to 80:
* The percent of prehospital provider agencies in the state or territory that have on-line pediatric medical direction available from dispatch through patient transport to a definitive care facility.
* The percent of prehospital provider agencies in the state/territory that have off-line pediatric medical direction available from dispatch through patient transport to a definitive care facility.
* The percent of patient care units in the state or territory that have essential pediatric equipment and supplies as outlined in national guidelines.
* The percent of hospitals recognized through a statewide, territorial, or regional standardized system that are able to stabilize or manage pediatric medical emergencies.
* The percent of hospitals recognized through a statewide, territorial, or regional standardized system that are able to stabilize and/or manage pediatric traumatic emergencies.
* The percentage of hospitals in the state/territory that have written interfacility transfer guidelines that cover pediatric patients and that include pre-defined components of transfer.
* The percent of hospitals in the state/territory that have written interfacility transfer agreements that cover pediatric patients.
* The adoption of requirements by the state/territory for pediatric emergency education for license/certification renewal of BLS/ALS providers.
* The degree to which state/territories have established permanence of EMSC in the state/territory EMS system by establishing an EMSC Advisory Committee, incorporating pediatric representation on the EMS Board, and hiring a full-time EMSC manager.
* The degree to which state/territories have established permanence of EMSC in the state/territory EMS system by integrating EMSC priorities into statutes/regulations.

==Partnerships==
The program works with a variety of national and professional organizations{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2014}} to identify and address the key issues affecting EMS, including but not limited to: managed care, disaster preparedness, children with special health care needs, mental health, family-centered care, and cultural diversity.  The program develops national task forces and publishes comprehensive reports drawing attention to many of these issues.

===Emergency department readiness project===
In 2013, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Emergency Physicians, the [[Emergency Nurses Association]], and the EMSC cooperated in a quality improvement project. Approximately 5,000 EDs were offered an assessment of their department's readiness, based on six topic areas published in the 2009 Guidelines for the Care of Children in the Emergency Department (or National Guidelines).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrensnational.org/files/PDF/EMSC/PubRes/Guidelines_for_Care_of_Children_in_the_ED.pdf "Guidelines for Care of Children in the Emergency Department"] Children's National organization.&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment was conducted over a period of seven months. The response rate of EDs was over eighty percent. Assessments were completed by August 2013. Upon completion of their assessment, each emergency department was given a pediatric readiness score, a gap analysis and access to an on-line toolkit to assist in  quality improvement initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.PediatricReadiness.org/ "Peds Ready."] National Peds Ready results and tool kit.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-facility transfer tool kit for the pediatric patient===
In collaboration with the Emergency Nurses Association and the Society of Trauma Nurses, the EMSC developed the Inter Facility Transfer Tool Kit for the Pediatric Patient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pediatricreadiness.org/files/PDF/Inter_Facility_Tool_Kit/Inter_Facility_TransferTool_Kit.zip "Inter Facility Transfer Tool Kit for the Pediatric Patient."] Pediatric Readiness organization website.&lt;/ref&gt; The toolkit includes an algorithm for developing transfer processes; talking points; example guidelines, agreements, and memorandums of understanding; and case presentations.

===Equipment list for ambulances===
The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma, the National Association of EMS Physicians, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), and the EMSC Partnership for Children Stakeholder Group collaborated to revise the recommended equipment list for ambulances. This revised document was to be used to evaluate the availability of pediatric equipment and supplies for basic and advanced life support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnmc.org/files/PDF/EMSC/PubRes/Equipment_for_ambulances_FINAL.pdf "Equipment for ambulances."] CNMC organization document. Accessed March 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pediatric medication safety in the emergency department===
Duke University and the AAP convened a multidisciplinary panel provide recommendations to improve pediatric medication safety in the emergency department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrensnational.org/emsc/NationalActivities "Ensuring that all children receive appropriate care in a health care emergency."] EMSC National Resource Centre. Accessed March 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA)===
The George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services Department of Health Policy and the NRC published an issue brief entitled ''The Application of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) to Hospital Inpatients''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrensnational.org/files/PDF/EMSC/PubRes/EMTALAIssueBrief.pdf "The Application of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) to Hospital Inpatients."] The George Washington University Medical Center. Accessed March 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===EMS-related research===
The Federal Interagency Committee on EMS and the EMSCNRC conducted a gap analysis of EMS related research. The analysis included over 270 articles. Its aim was to provide an evidence base for decision makers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrensnational.org/files/PDF/EMSC/NationalActivities/Gap_Analysis_of_EMS_Related_Research.pdf "Gap analysis of EMS related research."] EMSCNRC Children's National Medical Center.

The '''Fistula Foundation''' is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization focused on treatment of [[obstetric fistula]], funding more repair surgeries than any other organization.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} The organization is dedicated to providing obstetric fistula treatment worldwide, and does this by channeling funds toward fistula surgeon training, equipment and facility upgrades that make fistula treatment as safe as possible, and by funding the full cost of obstetric fistula repair surgery for poor women who would otherwise not be able to access treatment. Fistula Foundation has been recognized by several organizations for its transparency and efficiency, earning a top "A" rating from [[Charity Watch]] and a four star rating from [[Charity Navigator]] for 12 years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Charity Navigator Rating - Fistula Foundation|url = http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=8855#.VgW42hFVhBc|website = Charity Navigator|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fistula Foundation has also been selected as one of 20 charities recommended&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Life You Can Save - Where to Donate|url = http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Where-to-Donate|website = The Life You Can Save|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Princeton Professor [[Peter Singer]]'s organization, The Life You Can Save.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Life You Can Save - Effective giving against world poverty|url = http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/|website = www.thelifeyoucansave.org|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Fistula Foundation was founded in 2000. It is headquartered in San Jose, California. Since its inception, it has raised more than $55 million from donors from more than 60 countries. Until 2008, the Foundation supported only the work of Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia, founded by Dr. [[Catherine Hamlin]] and her husband Reginald Hamlin. Since 2009, the Foundation has extended its reach, having funded grantee partners in a total of 31 countries across Africa and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fistulafoundation.org/wherewehelp/&lt;/ref&gt; The organization funds sites in more than 20 countries.

== Focus ==
The primary focus of Fistula Foundation is treatment, either directly through fistula repair surgeries, or indirectly through training of surgeons and the provision and equipping of medical facilities. Countries where the Foundation has supported projects include Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia, Somaliland, Sudan, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Fistula Foundation also funds surgeon training, growing the pool of skilled fistula surgeons with the ability to perform what can be a very complex surgery. The organization funds the FIGO Fistula Training Initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fistula Training Initiative {{!}} FIGO|url = http://www.figo.org/fistula-training-initiative|website = www.figo.org|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which works to build the capacity of fistula surgeons in accredited training centers using the FIGO Global Competency-Based Fistula Surgery Training Manual. The manual is the only global competency-based standard for fistula surgeon training, and was authored by a former Foundation Board Chair, Dr. Sohier Elneil.

== Leadership ==
Fistula Foundation is run by CEO [[Kate Grant]], who joined the organization in 2005 as its first chief executive. Under her leadership, the Foundation has grown from supporting one facility in one country to a global organization that has since funded treatment across 31 countries. During her tenure the Foundation more than quadrupled its revenue and has supported more than 10 times the number of fistula treatment surgeries it supports. In 2014, Ms. Grant was the recipient of the prestigious American Marketing Association Foundation "Nonprofit Marketer of the Year Award."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://themarketingfoundation.org/nonprofit_marketer_of_the_year_2014.html|title=American Marketing Association Foundation - Nonprofit Marketer of the Year|website=themarketingfoundation.org|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation has a seven-member Board of Directors; the chair is Bill Mann. Fistula Foundation meets all [[Better Business Bureau]] [[BBB Wise Giving Alliance#Standards for Charity Accountability|Standards of Charity Accountability]] and has received the top 4-Star Rating from Charity Navigator for the last twelve years, placing it in the top 1% of charities nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=8855 The Fistula Foundation], Charity Navigator&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==
The Foundation is a partner of the [[United Nations Population Fund]]’s Campaign to End Fistula. Other partners include Women and Health Alliance (WAHA), [[Direct Relief]], the [[International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics]] (FIGO) and the International Society of Obstetric Fistula Surgeons (ISOFS). The Foundation was a primary funder of the [http://www.globalfistulamap.org Global Fistula Treatment Map]. 

Fistula Foundation has received funding and supplies from Johnson &amp; Johnson. The company has partnered with Fistula Foundation for the last decade, providing more than $1 million in support.

Fistula Foundation also works in Kenya to run the [https://www.fistulafoundation.org/join-us/action-on-fistula/ Action on Fistula] program, an initiative designed to treat women, train more fistula surgeons and build a lasting national network of treatment partners, funded by Astellas Pharma EMEA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fistulafoundation.org/whatwedo/partnerships.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since its launch in 2014, the program has treated over 2,700 women, added six facilities to a nationwide fistula treatment network, certified six new Kenyan fistula surgeons at FIGO global competency level, and reached more than 500,000 community members through outreach events designed to educate communities about obstetric fistula, how to identify it and where to receive treatment. 

== Media ==
The Foundation was a primary sponsor of the documentary film ''[[A Walk to Beautiful]]'' which won the Best Feature-Length Documentary of 2007 from the [[International Documentary Association]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.documentary.org/programs/awards.php&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an Emmy for best long form documentary in 2008. The film tells the story of five Ethiopian women treated by Dr. Hamlin and her staff at the [[Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital]]. PBS's ''[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'' is the other major sponsor of the documentary.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/beautiful/&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the Foundation has been mentioned several times by [[Nicholas D. Kristof]] in the ''New York Times'' and is a featured NGO partner of the Half the Sky Movement, a movement surrounding the PBS documentary film release of the book that Kristof authored with wife Sheryl WuDunn: ''Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.halftheskymovement.org&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign includes the popular Facebook-based game, [https://www.facebook.com/HalftheGame Half the Game]. Thanks to generous support from Johnson &amp; Johnson, players of this game can help fund fistula treatment in the real world, through online actions in the game.

Comedian [[Louis C.K.]] won $50,000 for the Fistula Foundation in May 2016 on the ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' "Power Players" edition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_29912338/comedians-jeopardy-win-puts-san-jose-based-fistula&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation continues to generate high profile attention through Grant's articles for [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/kate-776 ''The Huffington Pos''t], as well as in major international publications, such as Ms. Grant's 2016 contribution to [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/23/why-do-a-million-women-still-suffer-the-treatable-condition-of-fistula ''The Guardian'']. The Foundation was also featured in Kenyan television ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inHPJmIJQ3U CitizenTV], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilQ7S9w7mrk NTV]) for celebrating the grand opening of the Gynocare Women's &amp; Fistula Center, a hospital funded by Foundation's donors.

The '''Franciscan Sisters of Mary''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[congregation (Catholic)|religious congregation]] of [[religious sister]]s based in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], which was formed in 1987 from the merger of two related congregations. The congregations founded hospitals throughout the [[Midwestern United States]], which the current congregation still operates.

==History==
The congregation has its origins in St. Louis in the work of Mother [[Mary Odilia Berger]] who had emigrated from Germany in 1872 with four companions. The original congregation was the '''[[Sisters of St. Mary]]''' (S.S.M.). They received their name because their residence shared a door with [[St. Mary of Victories Church]] in downtown St. Louis.

Anna Katherine (later Mother Odilia) Berger was born in [[Regen]] in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]]. In 1858 she joined the [[Poor Franciscan Sisters of the Holy Family]] of [[Pirmasens]], Germany, founded by the [[beatification|Blessed]] [[Paul Joseph Nardini]] and was sent to beg in [[Paris]].

In Paris she co-founded the [[Sisters Servants of the Sacred Heart]] in 1866 with the [[Abbé]] [[Peter-Victor Braun]], but had to flee Paris when the city was besieged during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Berger spent several years in [[Elberfeld]] in the [[Rhineland]], where she tried to start a new community with the same goals. Frustrated in this goal by the government of the ''[[Kulturkampf]]'', she and four of her companions emigrated to St. Louis in 1872. In 1874 they founded the Sisters of St. Mary under the [[monasticism|Rule]] of the [[Third Order of St. Francis#Third Order Regular|Franciscan Third Order Regular]].

In 1877 the congregation borrowed what was then the enormous sum of $16,000 in order to open St. Mary's Infirmary in St. Louis.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} In 1878 Berger sent a third of the members of the congregation to [[Canton, Mississippi]], and [[Memphis, Tennessee]], during a [[Yellow fever]] outbreak in those cities. Five young sisters were to die as a result.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fsmonline.org/history/|title=History {{!}} Franciscan Sisters of Mary|work=Franciscan Sisters of Mary|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894 [[Mother (religious title)|Mother]] [[Mary Augustine Giesen]] led six other Sisters to [[Maryville, Missouri]], from St. Louis. After settling there, they eventually chose to separate from the founding congregation and they formed the '''[[Sisters of St. Francis of Maryville]]'''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The new congregation focused on health care in the more rural areas of Missouri. They established the first full-fledged hospital in the town. They later expanded to the [[Oklahoma Territory]], where they established the first hospital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The two congregations continued to grow in their numbers and work. With the reduced numbers of both congregations by the late 20th&amp;nbsp;century, however, in May 1985 the members of both congregations voted to merge into a new one. In August 1987 the sisters came together to form the '''Franciscan Sisters of Mary'''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2010 the 80-year-old convent was vacated at St. Mary's Hospital in the [[Richmond Heights, Missouri|Richmond Heights]] suburb of St. Louis, as the sisters moved to smaller quarters or a retirement home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/after-years-of-service-a-convent-at-st-mary-s/article_94094d90-f4c0-5630-921e-c03dffbe4d55.html|title=After 80 years of service, a convent at St. Mary's is being vacated|last=314-340-8259|first=ELIZABETHE HOLLAND • eholland@post-dispatch.com &gt;|work=stltoday.com|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/ecological-justice-work-franciscan-sisters-mary-west-lake-landfill-and-beyond|title=The ecological justice work of the Franciscan Sisters of Mary at West Lake landfill — and beyond|last=Moffitt|first=Kelly|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty hospitals and two nursing homes founded by the congregation are now operated as [[SSM Health Care]] (SSMHC) in Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma and Wisconsin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11643">'''Healthcare in [[Iceland]]''' is [[universal health care|universal]]. The healthcare system is largely paid for by taxes (85%) and to some extent by service fees (15%) and is administrated by the [[Ministry of Welfare (Iceland)|Ministry of Welfare]]. A considerable portion of government spending is assigned to health care. There is almost no private health insurance in Iceland and no private hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;http://archsurg.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/141/2/199#SEC8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Health care provider|Healthcare providers]] in Iceland fall into one of the following legally defined categories of healthcare providers:

*[[Clinic|Healthcare Clinics]] ({{lang-is|heilsugæslur}})
*[[Community Health Center|Health Institutions]] ({{lang-is|heilbrigðisstofnanir}})
*[[University Hospital]]s ({{lang-is|háskólasjúkrahús}})
*[[Teaching Hospital]]s ({{lang-is|kennslusjúkrahús}})

== Financing and funding ==
Health care system in Iceland relies on general taxation, instead of local funding. This is affected by the [[Nordic model|Nordic welfare state model]], in which public service is heavily funded through taxation to support the general public, in order for the population to have equal access to health care and welfare system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism|last=Esping-Andersen|first=Gøsta|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1990|isbn=9780069028573|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although local authorities have limited influence over the national health care system, Iceland has recently adapted to similar structures to other Nordic countries, implementing decentralized structure by dividing the country into seven local health care regions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young, Marchildon|first=Kue, Gregory|year=2012|title=A Comparative Review of Circumpolar Health Systems|url=http://www.circumpolarhealthjournal.net/public/journals/32/chs/CHS_2012_9.pdf|journal=The Circumpolar Health Supplements|volume=2012 | issue = 9 |pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The health care regions were implemented to promote cooperations between institutions, and to provide quality care through regional provisions. However, this has not affected the financial responsibility of the central government. Although health care is usually funded through taxation, some out-of-pocket expenses are still required, such as service fees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Iceland does not operate its health care system based on financial need, but some disadvantaged groups, including disabled and elders, generally receive discounts on personal health expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vilhjalmsson|first=Runar|year=2009|title=Out-of-pocket health care expenditures among population groups in Iceland|url=|journal=Laeknabladid|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of recently, out-of-pocket expenditure has increased significantly, resulted in approximately 76% increase in private expenditure from 1995 to 2010.  By 2011, Iceland's out-of-pocket payments have become an important financial source for the universal health care system, which made up 18.2% of total health expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maresso|first=Anna|year=2014|title=Iceland: Health System Review|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/271017/Iceland-HiT-web.pdf|journal=Health Systems in Transition|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general population, however, still showed overwhelming support for governmental funding and providing the health care system at the same time. Through a research survey conducted in 2013 focused on Icelandic adults, in which 94% of the respondents want the government to spend more on public health care, and 81% of the respondents prefer and supports primary health care to be provided by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vilhjalmsson|first=Runar|year=2016|title=Public views on the role of government in funding and delivering health services|url=http://sjp.sagepub.com/content/44/5/446.full.pdf+html|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Public Health|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the government aimed to provide easy and accessible health care to all population regardless of income and social status, there are still some problems faced due to benefits given to disadvantaged groups. Some people without additional help face postponement or even cancellation to medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vilhjalmsson|first=Runar|year=2005|title=Failure to seek needed medical care: Results from a national health survey of Icelanders|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0277953605000614/1-s2.0-S0277953605000614-main.pdf?_tid=febd1d2e-b910-11e6-a061-00000aab0f02&amp;acdnat=1480739512_4b756729a17e4cedbfbe0ae6ff3bb605|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=61|issue=6|pages=1320–1330|via=|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.01.024|pmid=15970241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health care services ==

=== Primary care ===
Health centers that provide primary health care are located throughout the country, while some runs along smaller institutes and hospitals, all are funded and administered by central government.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young, Marchildon|first=Kue, Gregory|year=2012|title=A Comparative Review of Circumpolar Health Systems|url=http://www.circumpolarhealthjournal.net/public/journals/32/chs/CHS_2012_9.pdf|journal=The Circumpolar Health Supplements|volume=2012 | issue = 9 |pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the 1973 Health Care Act, which established universal primary health care and increase the amount of health personnel and institutes in the country, all patients are required to register and access through a primary care center and a general practitioner of their choice.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sigurgeirsdóttir|first=Sigurbjörg|year=2012|title=International Profiles of Health Care Systems, 2012|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/Files/Publications/Fund%20Report/2012/Nov/1645_Squires_intl_profiles_hlt_care_systems_2012.pdf|journal=The Commonwealth Fund|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialist services are provided mainly by general practitioners, privately operated or publicly funded.

=== Hospital services ===
There are a total of 6 regional hospitals and 16 health institutions throughout the country, funded through fixed global budgets. The main hospital is located in Reykjavik. Most hospital professionals and doctors are salaried employees, and are paid through hospital budgets. Doctors can also see private patients outside of the hospitals if they receive 80 percent of less.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Long-term care ===
Long-term care can be accessed through institutions or at home. These includes personal assistance and domestic care, including nursing homes or child care. These services are provided by either private institutes or public services, and are funded through national budgets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Part-time and home-based child care are payable but subsidized, priority are given to special interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jonsson|first=Gudmundur|year=2001|title=The Icelandic Welfare State in the Twentieth Century|journal=Scandinavian Journal of History|volume=26|issue=3|pages=249–267|doi=10.1080/034687501750303873|pmid=17844641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical training==
Iceland does not have its own specialist medical training system, so Icelandic doctors typically spend 8 or 10 years working abroad before returning to the country.  They often use the relationship established in training for ongoing support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Outcomes in EHCI 2015|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2015/EHCI_2015_report.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2016|publisher=Health Consumer Powerhouse|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healthcare districts==
[[File:NUMBERED-ICELAND-REGION-(with labels).png|right|thumb|200px|The regions of Iceland. 5 and 6 correspond to the Northern District]]
The country is divided into 7 healthcare districts which correspond to the 8 [[regions of Iceland]] with the exception of the [[Northwestern Region (Iceland)|Northwestern Region]] and the [[Northeastern Region (Iceland)|Northeastern Region]] which are a single healthcare district.

'''Heinrich Khunrath''' (c. 1560 – 9 September 1605), or '''Dr. Henricus Khunrath''' as he was also called, was a German [[physician]], [[Hermetic philosophy|hermetic philosopher]], and [[Alchemy|alchemist]]. [[Frances Yates]] considered him to be a link between the philosophy of [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and [[Rosicrucianism]].

== Life and education ==
Khunrath was born in [[Dresden]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], the son of the merchant Sebastian Kunrat and his wife Anna in the year 1560. He was the younger brother of the Leipzig physician [[Conrad Khunrath]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Ladenburg: Heinrich Khunrath. In: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie. Band 15. Duncker &amp; Humblot, Leipzig 1882, S. 709.&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of 1570, he may have enrolled at the [[University of Leipzig]] under the name of Henricus Conrad Lips. The uncertainties surrounding his life stem from his supposed use of multiple names. It is certain that in May 1588, he matriculated at the [[University of Basel]], [[Switzerland]], earning his ''[[Doctor of Medicine|Medicinæ Doctor]]'' degree on 3 September 1588, after a defense of twenty-eight doctoral theses.

== Career ==
Khunrath, a disciple of [[Paracelsus]], practiced medicine in Dresden, [[Magdeburg]], and [[Hamburg]] and may have held a [[professor]]ial position in Leipzig. He travelled widely after 1588, including a stay at the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] court in [[Prague]], home to the mystically inclined [[Habsburg]] emperor [[Rudolf II]]. Before reaching Prague he had met [[John Dee]] at Bremen on 27 May 1589, when Dee was on his way back to England from Bohemia.  Khunrath praised Dee in his later works.  During his court stay Khunrath met the alchemist [[Edward Kelley]] who had remained behind after he and Dee had parted company (Kelley was arrested on 30 April 1591 as an alleged imposter). In September 1591, Khunrath was appointed court physician to [[Count Rosemberk]] in [[Trebona]]. He probably met [[Johann Thölde]] while at Trebona, one of the suggested authors of the "[[Basilius Valentinus]]" treatises on alchemy.

== Hermetic alchemist ==
[[File:Amphitheatrum sapientiae aeternae - Alchemist's Laboratory.jpg|thumb|450px|"The First Stage of the Great Work," better-known as the "Alchemist's Laboratory." The drawing of the laboratory is credited to architectural painter [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]] (1527–1604) and shows Khunrath in his laboratory.]]

Khunrath's brushes with John Dee and Thölde and Paracelsian beliefs led him to develop a Christianized natural [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], seeking to find the secret ''[[prima materia]]'' that would lead man into eternal wisdom. The Christianized view that Khunrath took was framed around his commitment to [[Lutheran]] theology. He also held that experience and observation were essential to practical alchemical research, as would a [[natural philosopher]].

His most famous work on alchemy is the ''[[Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae]]'' (Amphitheater of Eternal Wisdom), a work on the mystical aspects of that art, which contains the oft-seen engraving entitled "The First Stage of the Great Work", better-known as the "Alchemist's Laboratory". The book was first published at Hamburg in 1595, with four circular elaborate, hand-colored, engraved plates heightened with gold and silver which Khunrath designed and were engraved by [[Paullus van der Doort]]. The book was then made more widely available in an expanded edition with the addition of other plates published posthumously in [[Hanau]] in 1609. ''Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae'' is an alchemical classic, combining both Christianity and magic. In it, Khunrath showed himself to be an adept of spiritual alchemy and illustrated the many-staged and intricate path to spiritual perfection. Khunrath's work was important in Lutheran circles. [[John Warwick Montgomery]] has pointed out that [[Johann Arndt]] (1555–1621), who was the influential writer of Lutheran books of pietiesm and devotion, composed a commentary on ''Amphitheatrum''. Some of the ideas in his works are [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] in nature and foreshadow Rosicrucianism.

== Death ==
Khunrath may have encountered some opposition to his alchemical work because most of his publications on alchemy were published widely after his death. He died in either Dresden or Leipzig on 9 September 1605. The tension between spirituality and experiment in ''Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae'' brought about its [[banned books|condemnation]] by the [[Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]] in 1625.

'''Hydrolethalus syndrome''' ('''HLS'''), less commonly referred to as '''Salonen-Herva-Norio syndrome''', is a rare [[genetic disorder]] that causes improper [[fetal development]], resulting in [[birth defect]]s and, most commonly, [[stillbirth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/genetic-disorders-encyclopedia/hydrolethalus-syndrome E-Notes: Hydrolethalus Syndrome]&lt;/ref&gt;

HLS is associated with [[HYLS1]] mutations. The gene encoding HYLS1 is responsible for proper cilial development within the human body. [[Cilia]] are microscopic projections that allow sensory input and signalling output within cells, as well as cell motility.&lt;ref name="cg11"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Oka M, Shimojima K, Yamamoto T, Hanaoka Y, Sato S, Yasuhara T, Yoshinaga H, Kobayashi K |  title = A novel HYLS1 homozygous mutation in living siblings with Joubert syndrome | journal = Clinical Genetics | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | pages = 739–43 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 26830932 | doi= 10.1111/cge.12752 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dysfunction results in a range of abnormalities that are often the result of improper cell signalling.&lt;ref name="pn10"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Waters A,  Beales P |  title = Ciliopathies: an expanding disease spectrum | journal = Pediatric Nephrology | volume = 26 | issue = 7 | pages = 1039–56 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21210154 | pmc = 3098370 | doi= 10.1007/s00467-010-1731-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant form, HLS2, with additional mutations to the ''KIF7'' gene, is less common.&lt;ref name="ng12"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Putoux A, Thomas S, Coene K, Davis E, Alanay Y, Ogur G, Uz E, Buzas D, Gomes C, Patrier S, Bennett C, Elkhartoufi N, Frison M, Rigonnot L, Joyé N, Pruvost S, Utine G, Boduroglu K, Nitschke P, Fertitta L, Thauvin-Robinet C, Munnich A, Cormier-Daire V, Hennekam R, Colin E, Akarsu N, Bole-Feysot C, Cagnard N, Schmitt A, Goudin N, Lyonnet S, Encha-Razavi F, Siffroi J, Winey M, Katsanis N, Gonzales M, Vekemans M, Beales P, Attié-Bitach T | title = KIF7 mutations cause fetal hydrolethalus and acrocallosal syndromes | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 601–6 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21552264 | pmc = 3674836 | doi= 10.1038/ng.826 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''KIF7'' also ensures correct cilia formation and function, specifically cilia stability and length.&lt;ref name="cml9"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Takao D, Verhey K |  title = Gated entry into the ciliary compartment | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 119–27 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26472341 | pmc = 4959937 | doi= 10.1007/s00018-015-2058-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrolethalus syndrome (HLS) was first mistakenly identified in Finland, during a study on [[Meckel syndrome]].&lt;ref name="jomg3"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salonen R, Herva R | title = Hydrolethalus syndrome | journal = Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 27 | issue = 12 | pages = 756–59 | date = December 1990 | pmid = 2074561 | pmc = 1017280 | doi= 10.1136/jmg.27.12.756 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like HLS, Meckel syndrome presents with severe physiological abnormalities, namely disruptions to the [[central nervous system]] and the presence of extra fingers or toes ([[polydactyly]]).&lt;ref name="jomg3" /&gt; HLS can be distinguished from Meckel syndrome by analysing kidney function, which is dysfunctional in Meckel syndrome as a result of [[cyst]] formation.&lt;ref name="rg4"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Honkala H | title = The molecular basis of hydrolethalus syndrome | journal = ResearchGate | pages = 756–59 | date = March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms ==
HLS presents itself as various, lethal developmental abnormalities, which often result in either premature stillbirth or death shortly after birth.&lt;ref name="jomg3" /&gt; Rare cases of children born with HLS surviving for several months have been noted.&lt;ref name="rg4" /&gt; A characteristic abnormality of HLS is an absence of brain tissue and midline structures, with the presence of excess brain fluid ([[hydrocephalus]]) as a result of abnormal development of the central nervous system.&lt;ref name="jomg3" /&gt; Other common defects include incomplete lung development, heart defects, a [[cleft lip]] or [[cleft palate|palate]], polydactyly, and an abnormally small jaw.&lt;ref name="jomg3" /&gt; Stillbirth and an excess of amniotic fluid ([[polyhydramnios]]) are common during pregnancy with a HLS-affected foetus, with cases of up to 8 litres cited compared to the normal 1 litre.&lt;ref name="rg4" /&gt; Less common symptoms such as abnormally small eyes and a broad nose are also possible.

==Cause==

===Genetic===
HLS is caused by a genetic [[missense mutation]] of the ''HYLS1'' gene, encoding for Hydrolethalus syndrome protein 1, on [[chromosome 11]];&lt;ref name="rg4" /&gt; a single base change to the [[amino acid]] sequence for ''HYLS1'' in [[exon]] 6 involves the replacement of [[aspartic acid]] 211 with [[glycine]] (D211G) in the polypeptide chain.&lt;ref name="pg6"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Honkala H, Lahtela J, Fox H, Gentile M, Pakkasjärvi N, Salonen R, Wartiovaara K, Jauhiainen M, Kestilä M |  title = Unraveling the disease pathogenesis behind lethal Hydrolethalus syndrome revealed multiple changes in molecular and cellular level | journal = PathoGenetics | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19400947 | pmc = 2686686 | doi= 10.1186/1755-8417-2-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exon 6 is the only protein coding exon in ''HYLS1''; proper functioning of exons 1-5 ensures regulation and expression of the entire protein.&lt;ref name="rg4" /&gt;
HLS is an [[autosomal recessive]] syndrome;&lt;ref name="hmg5"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Mee L, Honkala H, Kopra O, Vesa J, Finnilä S, Visapää I, Sang T, Jackson G, Salonen R, Kestilä M, Peltonen L |  title = Hydrolethalus syndrome is caused by a missense mutation in a novel gene HYLS1| journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 14 | issue = 11 | pages = 1475–88 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15843405 | doi= 10.1093/hmg/ddi157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; development is only possible if both parents carry the defective gene, and in that instance, the risk of the foetus developing the syndrome is 25%. HLS is a member of the [[Finnish disease heritage]],&lt;ref name="rg4" /&gt; with incidences more common in Finland than the rest of the world; roughly 1 in 20,000 developing foetuses are affected in Finland.&lt;ref name="jomg3" /&gt; Rare cases in other regions have also been documented, often with less severe [[phenotypes]] as a result of [[allele]] variability across countries, allowing survival of affected offspring for up to several months.&lt;ref name="rg4" /&gt; Individuals of Finnish descent are advised to undergo [[genetic testing]] before attempting to conceive.

Prior to the discovery of HLS, the ''HYLS1'' gene was unknown, and similar genes within humans have not been identified.&lt;ref name="rg4" /&gt; [[Orthologs]], genes in other species with common ancestral heritage, have been examined to explain the pathophysiology of HLS; a similar gene within the roundworm, ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', is responsible for the formation of cilia.&lt;ref name="gd7"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Dammermann A, Pemble H, Mitchell B, McLeod I, Yate J, Kintner C, Desai A, Oegema K |  title = The Hydrolethalus syndrome protein HYLS-1 links core centriole structure to cilia formation | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 23 | issue = 17 | pages = 2046–59 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19656802 | pmc = 2751977| doi= 10.1101/gad.1810409 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current hypotheses place a dysfunction of cilia as the main cause of HLS defects arising from the ''HYLS1'' mutation in humans.&lt;ref name="rg4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hmg5" /&gt;
Differences between [[wild type]] and mutant ''HYLS1'' have been clearly observed; the wild type form is localised to the [[cytoplasm]], while the mutant form is localised to the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and forms small clusters, suggesting that the mutant gene disrupts cellular localisation.&lt;ref name="hmg5" /&gt; The protein encoded by the ''HYLS1'' mutant form is unable to carry out essential targeting of [[centrioles]] to the plasma membrane, disrupting ciliary function, which results in [[ciliopathy]].&lt;ref name="gd7" /&gt; As cilia are located in almost all cells throughout the body, cilial dysfunction causes developmental defects in a range of organs and thus the phenotype of HLS can vary greatly, though brain malformation and polydactyly are most commonly observed.

===Environmental===
Currently, no [[environmental factors]] are known to increase the likelihood of HLS development or progression; HLS is caused only by [[genetic abnormalities]].&lt;ref name="cml9" /&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
The [[pathophysiology]] of HLS is abnormal cilia development arising from the inability of the mutated ''HYLS1'' gene to correctly target centrioles to the plasma membrane.&lt;ref name="gd7" /&gt; Specifically, transition fibres within the transition zone, at the base of the [[axoneme]] and adjoining to the plasma membrane, lack proper development.&lt;ref name="nc8"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Wei Q, Zhang Y, Schouteden, C, Zhang, Y, Zhang, Q, Dong, J, Wonesch, V, Ling, K, Dammermann, A, Hu, J |  title = The hydrolethalus syndrome protein HYLS-1 regulates formation of the ciliary gate | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 7 | issue = 12437 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27534274 | pmc = 4992140 | doi= 10.1038/ncomms12437}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these structures form the cilial gate, improper development results in a loss of selectivity for protein entry into the ciliary compartment.&lt;ref name="cml9" /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
HLS can be readily diagnosed during pregnancy through the use of [[ultrasound]], which will often reveal [[hydrocephaly]] and an abnormal structure of the brain.&lt;ref name='Orphanet' /&gt;
Precise examination via ultrasound or at birth is necessary to rule out Meckel syndrome, [[Trisomy 13]], or [[Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome]], which present with similar physiological defects.&lt;ref name="rg4" /&gt; HLS can be detected at the end of the first trimester, approximately 13 weeks [[gestation]].&lt;ref name="pg6" /&gt;

==Treatment==
No cure or treatment option for individuals with HLS currently exist.&lt;ref name="Orphanet"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/Disease_Search.php?lng=EN&amp;data_id=2075&amp;MISSING%2520CONTENT=Hydrolethalus&amp;search=Disease_Search_Simple&amp;title=Hydrolethalus |title=Orphanet: Hydrolethalus |date=2017-09-10 |language=en |access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the severity of the foetal defects and the poor prognosis for those with HLS, the pregnancy is often terminated.&lt;ref name="rg4" /&gt; Certain prevention can only be achieved by avoiding conception if genetic testing indicates both prospective parents as carriers of the defective ''HYLS1'' gene.&lt;ref name="hmg5" /&gt;

==Variations and related pathologies==
Mutations in ''KIF7'' have also been noted in patients that present a similar phenotype to HLS and the characteristic ''HYLS1'' A to G transformation; [[homozygous]] deletion of the ''KIF7'' gene causes a variant form of HLS, HLS2.&lt;ref name="ng12" /&gt; ''KIF7'' encodes a structural factor vital to cilial transport, and is also implicated in other developmental disorders, such as [[Joubert syndrome]] (JS).&lt;ref name="cg11" /&gt;
Additionally, mutations in ''HYLS1'' are no longer explicitly connected to HLS in humans.&lt;ref name="cg11" /&gt; Homozygous mutations removing the stop [[codon]] in exon 4 of ''HYLS1'' result in a different genomic sequence disruption to the missense mutation of HLS, and phenotypically present as JS.&lt;ref name="pn10" /&gt; The ‘molar tooth sign’ of the brain, an anomaly in which cerebellar volume is reduced but cerebellar shape is retained, resembles the molar tooth and is used to identify JS.&lt;ref name="cg11" /&gt; JS presents with mutations in more than 30 genes, whilst the ''HYLS1'' mutation is the sole cause of HLS, but is also present in the HLS2 variant form with the mutated ''KIF7'' gene.&lt;ref name="ng12" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1721">'''Hyeminseo''' ({{korean|hangul=혜민서|hanja=惠民署|mr=Hyeminsŏ}}) was the medical authority of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] in [[Korea]]. The officers were in charge of the treatment of commoners and medicine.

In 1392, the year of the foundation of Joseon, the organ was established to succeed the Hyemingoguk ({{korean|labels=no|hangul=혜민고국|hanja=惠民庫局}}), the former medical institution of [[Goryeo]]. In 1414, its name became Hyeminguk ({{korean|labels=no|hangul=혜민국|hanja=惠民局}}), and then finally changed to the name Hyeminseo in 1466 under the reign of [[Sejo of Joseon]]. It was abolished in 1882.

The officers were in charge of producing medicines, teaching disciplines, researching [[Korean medicine]]. Generally, four people were put to as the disciplines. Bureaucrats of Hyeminseo were also appointed through the ''[[gwageo]]'' recruitment examination.

Hyeminseo aimed to benefit the people but its coverage was limited to commoners living in Hanyang (now [[Seoul]]). There was another medical authority called Hwalinseo ({{korean|labels=no|hangul={{linktext|pref=:ko|활인서}}|hanja=活人署}}). Collectively, the two were referred to as Yanguisa ({{korean|labels=no|hangul=양의사|hanja=兩醫司|lit="the two medical authorities"}}).

'''ISO 45001''' is an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard for management systems of [[occupational health and safety]] (OH&amp;S), published in March 2018. The goal of ISO 45001 is the reduction of occupational injuries and diseases.&lt;ref name="description page"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/iso-45001-occupational-health-and-safety.html|title=ISO 45001 Occupational health and safety|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard is based on [[OHSAS 18001]], conventions and guidelines of the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organization]] including [[ILO]] OSH 2001, and national standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ILO OSH 2001 |url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/info/standards-and-instruments/WCMS_107727/lang--en/index.htm |website=www.ilo.org |publisher=ILO |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="description page" /&gt; It includes elements that are additional to BS OHSAS 18001 (see below: ''ISO 45001 changes compared to OHSAS 18001:2007'') which it is replacing over a three-year migration period from 2018 to 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ISO 45001 |url=https://www.iso.org/iso-45001-occupational-health-and-safety.html |website=www.iso.org |publisher=ISO official website |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

ISO 45001 also follows the High Level Structure of other ISO standards like ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 which makes integration of these standards much easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=International Standards Organisation |first1=ISO |title=Information brochure - ISO 45001 |publisher=ISO |location=Geneva |edition=1 |url=https://www.iso.org/publication/PUB100427.html |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ISO high level structure explained |url=https://auditortraining.pwc.com.au/new-iso-high-level-structure-mean/ |website=www.auditortraining.pwc.com.au |publisher=PWC (Price waterhouse coopers) |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Development==
ISO 45001 was proposed at the ISO in October 2013. The committee ISO/PC 283, created in 2013, had direct responsibility for the standardization process.&lt;ref name="standard page"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/63787.html|title=ISO 45001:2018 - Occupational health and safety management systems -- Requirements with guidance for use|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 70 countries contributed to the drafting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iso.org/news/ref2272.html|title=ISO 45001 is now published|work=ISO|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparation and committee work lasted until December 2015. From 2015 to 2017, a first draft failed to gain sufficient approval from ISO members and was revised in a second draft, which was approved and refined into a final draft.&lt;ref name="standard page" /&gt; In the final vote the standard garnered 62 votes in favour, nine abstentions and four votes against from France, India, Spain, and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.preventionbtp.fr/Actualites/Toutes-les-actualites/Europe-Monde/La-norme-ISO-45001-publiee-prochainement |title=La norme ISO 45001 publiée prochainement |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-02-26 |publisher=Organisme Professionnel de Prévention du Bâtiment et Travaux Publics |language=French |access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard was published on 12 March 2018.&lt;ref name="standard page" /&gt;

== Certification ==
ISO 45001 is set to replace [[OHSAS 18001]] over three years following its publication. It uses the management system standard structure guideline [[Annex SL]] to allow for simplified integration with other management system standards, such as [[ISO 9001]] and [[ISO 14001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iso.org/news/ref2270.html|title=Let the migration begin|work=ISO|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Accreditation Forum]] has published requirements for migration from OHSAS 18001 to ISO 45001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iaf.nu/articles/Mandatory_Documents_/38|title=IAF Publications: Mandatory Documents|last=|first=|date=2018-02-01|website=www.iaf.nu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO/IEC TS 17021-10:2018 is a technical specification setting out competence requirements for auditing and certification of ISO 45001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/71102.html |title=ISO/IEC TS 17021-10:2018 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |publisher=ISO |access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adoption ==
ISO 45001 was adopted as a national standard by Albania, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:#00f"&gt;N-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;{{Ref label|discuss|1|a}} Adoption as a national standard is under consideration in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.standards.org.au/news/iso-45001-occupational-health-and-safety-management-systems-%E2%80%93-requirements-with-guidance-for-use |title=ISO 45001 Occupational health and safety management systems – Requirements with guidance for use |last=McGrath |first=Scott |date=2018-03-12 |publisher=Standards Australia |access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ISO 45001 changes compared to OHSAS 18001:2007 ==

* Context of the organization (Clause 4.1): The organization shall determine internal and external issues that are relevant to its purpose and that affect its ability to achieve the intended outcome(s) of its OH &amp; S management system.
* Understanding the needs and expectations of workers and other interested parties (clause 4.2): interested parties are workers, suppliers, subcontractors, clients, regulatory authorities.
* Risk and opportunities (Clauses: 6.1.1, 6.1.2.3, 6.1.4): companies are to determine, consider and, where necessary, take action to address any risks or opportunities that may impact (either positively or negatively) the ability of the management system to deliver its intended results, including enhanced health and safety at the workplace.
* Leadership and management commitment (Clauses: 5.1) has stronger emphasis on top management to actively engage and take accountability for the effectiveness of the management system.

The '''International Society for Bipolar Disorders''' ('''ISBD''') is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], where it was founded June 17, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isbd.org/about |title=About ISBD - The International Society for Bipolar Disorders |publisher=ISBD |date=1999-06-17 |accessdate=2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society focuses on research and education in [[bipolar disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://apps.irs.gov/charities/charitable/index.html Internal Revenue Service of the Department of the United States Treasury]&lt;/ref&gt;

The society has a membership consisting of [[mental health professional]]s and patients and their family members representing 50 countries. The mission of the society is to advance the treatment of all aspects of bipolar disorder, thereby improving patient outcomes and quality of life, through fostering international collaboration in education and research. The society hosts biennial professional meetings and offers educational programs. The official journal of the society is ''[[Bipolar Disorders (journal)|Bipolar Disorders]]'' and a subscription is included with membership.

== History ==
The ISBD was founded at the 3rd International Conference on Bipolar Disorder, in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] in June 1999 by David J. Kupfer and [[Thomas Detre]] ([[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isbd.org Official Website of the International Society for Bipolar Disorders]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1999, the official [[peer-reviewed]] society journal, ''Bipolar Disorders'', published its first issue.

The ISBD held its first meeting in [[Sydney, Australia]] in February 2004 with over 400 participants in attendance. The society held its second meeting in August 2006 in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]] with over 600 attendees. {{As of|2013}}, the society has over 800 members in 50 countries with an elected board representing 15 countries. The president is Willem Nolen.

== Educational programs ==
The society supports the following educational initiatives:
*The Psychiatric Trainee Support program offers psychiatric trainees a free two-year membership in the society in order to enhance knowledge of bipolar disorder among this group, narrow the gap between bipolar research and clinical practice, and ultimately to improve diagnosis, treatment and outcomes for patients with bipolar disorder. These supported memberships are open to psychiatric residents, postgraduate students and junior faculty up to the Assistant Professor or equivalent level with less than five years as faculty in their career trajectory. The programs seek to support 70% of trainees from developing countries.
*The Samuel Gershon Awards for Junior Investigators, named in honor of [[Samuel Gershon]], past ISBD President and pioneer of early [[lithium]] research, offer four awards for original research submissions. Awards are based on the originality of the content, as well as the significance of the findings reported, and are evaluated by an international scientific panel under the auspices of the ISBD. These awards are open to psychiatric trainees, postgraduate students and junior faculty up to the assistant professor rank from around the world. The awards are presented in conjunction with the society's biennial meeting where the winners present their research in a special session showcasing the work of junior people in the field.
*The ISBD Research Fellowship for Junior Investigators provides an opportunity for the recipient to travel to another facility to get training in a particular type of research methodology (i.e. brain imaging, genetics, clinical trials, etc.). The fellowship is intended to cover up to 6 months support for salary, travel, or some combination of these costs as they are incurred in pursuit of additional training. This could take the form of summer programs, participation in smaller prospective studies, or through some other opportunity.

== Conferences ==
The society organizes biennial meetings that provides updates on topics such as [[epidemiology]], pharmacotherapy, psychotherapies, genetics, neurobiology, imaging research, and bipolar disorder in special populations.

The '''Japanese Medical Marijuana Association''' ({{lang-ja|医療大麻を考える会}}, ''Iryō taima o kangaeru kai'') was founded in 1999 and seeks to improve access to [[medical cannabis]]. Its status under Japanese law is Specified Nonprofit Corporation (特定非営利活動法人).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=アピール|trans-title=Appeal|publisher=Japanese Medical Marijuana Association|url=http://iryotaima.net/wp/?page_id=59|accessdate=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{secondary source needed|date=April 2018}} Due to the illegality of cannabis in Japan, the organization has investigated leveraging legal medical [[cannabis in Guam]] for Japanese patients.

In 2014, JMMA president Koichi Maeda met with Guamanian senator Tina Muña-Barnes regarding Guam's medical cannabis program. In 2017, Maeda returned and met with governor [[Eddie Calvo]]. Maeda's intent was to develop Guam as a destination for Japanese people seeking cannabis remedies, and for the JMMA to promote cannabis [[medical tourism]] to Guam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.postguam.com/news/local/medical-marijuana-advocate-seeks-involvement-for-non-residents/article_6d5bef2c-e83b-11e6-a736-332d27c83ee6.html |title= Medical marijuana advocate seeks involvement for non-residents |author= John Connor, ''Post News'' |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|newspaper=[[Pacific Daily News]]|location=Hagåtña, Guam|title=Group eyes medical pot tourism|author=Jerick Sablan|date=February 4, 2017|url=https://www.guampdn.com/story/news/2017/02/04/group-eyes-medical-pot-tourism/97432546/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan's strict laws prevent Japanese citizens from using cannabis even when outside of Japan. However, Maeda stated that Japanese citizens with incurable diseases would be exempt from this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.postguam.com/news/local/gvb-to-research-tourism-related-medical-marijuana/article_47be4362-eb67-11e6-955e-07acd74cc1b7.html |title= GVB to research tourism-related medical marijuana |author= Tihu Lujan, ''Post News'' |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3209">'''Kumugwe''' (also '''Komokwa''' or '''Goomokwey''') (pronounced "koo-moo-gwee") is a figure in the mythology of [[Pacific Northwest]] peoples.  Known as "Copper-Maker", he is the god of the undersea world revered by the [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] and [[Nuxalk]] [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] nations. He has a house under the sea filled with riches, and his name means "wealthy one". He is sometimes identified as one and the same as Qaniqilak, the spirit of the summer fishing season, and is then regarded as the adversary of [[Tseiqami]] otherwise known as Thunderbird, the guiding spirit of the Winter [[Hamatsa]] Dance season.

Kumugwe is master of the seals. The posts and beams of his house are living sea lions. Sometimes he appears on the surface of the sea, but his head is so big that it looks like an island. He is responsible for the rising  and ebbing of the tides, as well as the riches these tides deposit on beaches, and those claimed by the vagaries of sea weather, both material and human lives. One terrific story recounts how he eats human eyes as if they were crab apples. Kumugwe has the power to see into the future, heal the sick and injured, and bestow powers on those whom he favors.

Many heroes went on quests to reach his undersea abode; those who made it were rewarded with riches and spirit magic. His world is guarded by the octopus.  Sometimes Kumugwe himself is conceived of in octopus form.  Kumugwe would teach the hero who entered his abode the ways of the sea, and give him gifts of blankets, coppers, songs, masks, and regalia.  These items of mystical regalia are called [[Tlugwe]] (or Tlokwe) in [[Kwak'wala]].  

One of Kumugwe's epithets is "Copper Maker." He has a wife named Tlakwakilayokwa, which means "Born to Be Copper Maker's Woman."  She is also sometimes named Kominaga. 

Masks of Kumugwe often show him with sea creature attributes, such as rounded fish eyes, and rows of gills at the corners of his mouth, not to mention fins encircling his head, the suction cups of an octopus, fish and aquatic birds which frame or sit upon his head. His most important totemic animals are loons, seals, sea lions, octopuses, orcas, and sculpins.

'''Lake Serre-Ponçon''' ({{lang-fr|Lac de Serre-Ponçon}}; [[Vivaro-Alpine dialect|Vivaro-Alpine]]: ''Lac de Sèrra Ponçon'') is a [[reservoir]] in the [[Departments of France|departments]] of [[Hautes-Alpes]] and [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]], [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] [[Regions of France|region]], in southeast [[France]], one of the largest in [[Western Europe]]. The lake gathers the waters of the [[Durance]] and the [[Ubaye]] rivers, flowing down through the [[Hautes-Alpes]] and the Alpes du Sud to the [[Rhône River]]. The waters are [[dam]]med by the {{lang|fr|Barrage de Serre-Ponçon}}, a {{convert|123|m||adj=on}} high earth core dam.

As well as water control, sixteen [[hydroelectric]] plants use the water (with additional water control supporting), and the lake provides [[irrigation]] to {{convert|1500|km2}} of land.

==History==
The lake was created to control water flow after disastrous floods caused severe damage and loss of life in 1843 and 1856. First proposed in 1895,  construction started in 1955 and was completed by 1961.

During construction of the lake, approximately {{convert|3000000|m3}} of material was moved. The dam was constructed and the valley slowly became a lake, flooding some villages in the process.  This flooding is the subject of [[Jean Giono]]'s movie ''[[Girl and the River]]'' (1958), starring [[Guy Béart]].

According to the official website of the Muséoscope, the "museum of the largest dam in Europe made of compacted soil", Lac de Serre-Ponçon includes a hydroelectric power plant with a 380 [[Megawatt|MW]] generator.&lt;ref name=Muséoscope&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museoscope-du-lac.com/en/presentation-dam-serre-poncon.html |title=The hydroelectric plant of Serre-Ponçon |work=Muséoscope of Serre-Ponçon lake |accessdate=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the power plant on the lake itself, the dam provides the reservoir and overall water management to facilitate an additional 15 hydroelectric plants along the [[Durance]] and [[Verdon (river)|Verdon]] rivers in south-eastern France, with total capacity of 2,000 MW.&lt;ref name=Muséoscope/&gt;

'''Leighton Moss RSPB reserve''' is a [[nature reserve]] in [[Lancashire]], England, which has been in the care of the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] since 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wetlands.org/RSIS/_COP9Directory/Directory/3UK026.html UNITED KINGDOM	 Ramsar Site 323] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416072925/http://www.wetlands.org/RSIS/_COP9Directory/Directory/3UK026.html |date=2013-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated at [[Silverdale, Lancashire|Silverdale]] near [[Carnforth]], on the edge of [[Morecambe Bay]] and in the [[Arnside and Silverdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].  

Leighton Moss contains the largest area of [[reed bed]]s in north-west England.&lt;ref name="IBA"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The site provides [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] for many [[species]] of [[wildlife]], including [[Eurasian bittern|bittern]]s and [[red deer]]. As a [[wetland]] of international importance, it was designated a [[Ramsar site]] in 1985. It is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]], a [[Special Protection Area]], and an [[Important Bird Area]].&lt;ref name="IBA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sitefactsheet.php?id=2505 | title=Important Bird Areas factsheet: Leighton Moss | accessdate=30 December 2012| author=[[BirdLife International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSPB reserve also protects an area of [[Morecambe Bay]], where a saltmarsh provides a habitat for birds such as [[pied avocet|avocet]]s.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-18857424 | title=Avocets flourish at RSPB Leighton Moss nature reserve | publisher=BBC News | date=2012 | accessdate=2013-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1822 the moss came into the possession of Richard Gillow, grandson of the Lancaster furniture manufacturer [[Robert Gillow]]. Using steam technology, Gillow drained the moss for agriculture. Although the soil is of good quality, by 1918 the land was flooded again, as drainage appeared to have become uneconomic. The area was used for duck shooting.

The RSPB initially leased the moss and then purchased it from the [[Leighton Hall, Lancashire|Leighton Hall estate]].

== Facilities ==
The reserve is entered through the visitor centre (a converted farmhouse) containing a shop and a tea-room. The centre also contains an education room.

There are seven [[Bird hide|observation hide]]s, which were renewed in 2012 with funding from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]]. One is named after comedian [[Eric Morecambe]].&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/news/10014481.Eric_Morecambe_s_daughter_brings_sunshine_to_new_Leighton_Moss_bird_hide/?ref=mmsp | title=Eric Morecambe's daughter brings sunshine to new Leighton Moss bird hide | work=''[[Westmorland Gazette]]'' | date=2012 | accessdate=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also nature trails.

== Management issues ==
The reed beds are managed to prevent them drying out and also to prevent saline intrusion from the coast. Despite such control of [[ecological succession]], the breeding bittern population (measured by "booming" males) has been in decline. This may be related to the reed beds being relatively mature.  

In 2015 there was controversy about a plan to cull "excess" numbers of deer, which were blamed for damaging the reeds.&lt;ref name="deer"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/news/11757589.Plans_to_cull_red_deer_at_Leighton_Moss_sparks_row_between_RSPB_reserve_and_animal_rights_campaigners/ | title=Plans to cull red deer | work=Westmorland Gazette | accessdate=1 February 2015 | author=Dickinson, Katie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media interest ==
In 2013 Leighton Moss hosted the BBC's ''[[Autumnwatch]]'' programme.&lt;ref name="LG"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.lancasterguardian.co.uk/news/local/silverdale-s-ancient-aura-of-wilderness-inspires-bbc-s-autumnwatch-1-6121628 | title=Silverdale's "ancient aura of wildness" | work=Lancaster Guardian | date=2013 | accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The programme returned in 2014.&lt;ref name="WG"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/news/11486452.BBC_s_Autumnwatch_to_return_to_Leighton_Moss_next_month/ | title=BBC's Autumnwatch | publisher=''Westmorland Gazette'' (www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk) | date=September 2014 | accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opening times ==
The reserve and visitor centre are open daily all year round (except Christmas Day) from 9 am to dusk and the visitor centre from 9.30 am – 5 pm (4.30 pm November–January inclusive). Entrance is free for RSPB members, and half price for those who come by public transport, bicycle or on foot. [[Silverdale railway station]] is just a few minutes' walk away.  The reserve is on a proposed cycle way around Morecambe Bay.&lt;ref name="cycle"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sustrans.org.uk/news/test-ride-new-cycle-way-around-morecambe-bay-0 | title=Test ride for new cycle way | publisher=Sustrans | date=2014 | accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macroom Oatmeal''' is a traditional stone-ground Irish oatmeal produced in [[Macroom]], County Cork, Ireland, at Walton's Mill, the last surviving stone mill in Ireland.&lt;ref name="weinzweig"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weinzweig|first=Ari|title=Ireland's Renowned Oatmeal|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2009/06/irelands-renowned-oatmeal/19101/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was taken aboard [[Slow Food]]'s [[Ark of Taste]] in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Macroom Irish Oatmeal|url=http://www.slowfoodfoundation.com/ark/details/1246/stone-ground-irish-oatmeal#.UzrVqceQMpQ|publisher=Slow Food|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of only seven Irish foods ever selected for the ark.

==History==
The mill has been operated continuously by the same family since the 1700s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Steve|title=Sowing Your Wild Oats: Comparing Macroom Oatmeal To Quaker Oats Is Like Comparing Caviar To Hamburgers|url=http://articles.courant.com/2006-03-05/features/0603030707_1_oatmeal-stoneware-bowls|work=The Hartford Courant|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donal Creedon, great-great-great-great-grandson of founder Richard Walton, now operates the mill.

==Production method==
Macroom oatmeal is stone-ground, then kiln-toasted.&lt;ref name=andrews /&gt;

==Reception==
[[Saveur Magazine]] called it "different from anyone else's in Ireland, full of flavor when simply cooked and immensely satisfying in its grainy texture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andrews|first=Colman|title=County Cork: Food Capital|url=http://www.saveur.com/article/Travels/County-Cork-Food-Capital|work=Saveur|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food writer [[John Thorne (writer)|John Thorne]] said it "may well be the best oatmeal I've ever eaten."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Original Macroom Oatmeal|url=http://www.cookingisfun.biz/shop/food/the-original-macroom-oatmeal.html|publisher=Ballymaloe Cookery School|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fodor's]] Ireland mentions Macroom Oatmeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fodor's Ireland|date=2013|isbn=978-0876371244|page=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Darina Allen]] of [[Ballymaloe House]], where Macroom Oatmeal is served for breakfast, said that Macroom Oatmeal has "a cult following both at home and abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Darina|title=Wellbeck Abbey|url=http://letters.cookingisfun.ie/2011/04/30/welbeck-abbey/|publisher=Ballymaloe Cooking School|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Beard Award|James Beard 2010 Cookbook of the Year]] ''The Country Cooking of Ireland'' says "(t)he best oatmeal for [[Stirabout]]...is Macroom, milled by Donal Creedon in the town of that name in County Cork."&lt;ref name=andrews&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Colman|title=The Country Cooking of Ireland|date=12 December 2012|publisher=Chronicle Books|page=346|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKBdBblqiX0C&amp;dq=donal+creedon+-meditation+-kagyu&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1060">'''Ninazu''' in [[Sumerian mythology]] was a god of the underworld, and of healing. He was the son of [[Enlil]] and [[Ninlil]] or, in alternative traditions, of [[Ereshkigal]] and [[Gugalana]], and was the father of [[Ningiszida]]. In the text [[Enki]] and [[Ninhursag]] he was described as the consort of [[Ninsutu]], one of the deities born to relieve the illness of Enki.

Ninazu was the patron deity of the city of [[Eshnunna]] until he was superseded by Tispak. His sanctuaries were the [[É (temple)|E-sikul]] and [[Ekur|E-kurma]]. Unlike his close relative [[Nergal]], he was generally benevolent.

'''Nursing homes''', also known as convalescent homes, are a type of [[residential care]] that provide around-the-clock nursing care for elderly or disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caregiverslibrary.org/caregivers-resources/grp-care-facilities/types-of-care-facilities-article.aspx|title=Types of Care Facilities|last=|first=|date=|website=Care givers library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-four-hour nursing care is available. Nursing homes will provide short-term rehabilitative stays following a surgery, illness or injury which may require [[physical therapy]], [[occupational therapy]] or [[speech-language therapy]]. Nursing homes offer other services such as planned activities and daily [[housekeeping]] services. Nursing homes may also be referred to as '''convalescent care''', '''skilled nursing''' or a '''long-term facility'''. Nursing homes may offer [[Alzheimer's disease|memory care]] services or have a separate area specified for memory care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esposito|first1=Lisa|title=What Nursing Home 'Memory Care' Means|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2016-06-01/what-nursing-home-memory-care-means|accessdate=29 July 2017|agency=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Unit visits Nursing Home (23444741899).jpg|thumb]]
[[File:Workroom at St James Workhouse.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[Poorhouse]]s/[[workhouse]]s were the first implemented national framework to provide a basic level of care to the old and infirm. Pictured, is "The workroom at St James's workhouse" from ''The Microcosm of London'' (1808).]]
Starting in the 17th century, the concept of [[poorhouse]]s (also referred to as [[almshouse]]s) were brought to America by English settlers.  All orphans, mentally ill and the poor elderly were placed into these living commons. These poorhouses gave a place where they could be given shelter and daily meals. Poorhouses continued to exist into the early 20th century despite the criticism they faced. Much of the criticism stemmed from the conditions of the poorhouses. [[Great Depression|The Great Depression]] overwhelmed the poorhouses as there were a lot of people that needed help and care but not enough space and funding in the poorhouses. Due to [[Muckraker|Muck Raking]] in the 1930s the less than favorable living conditions of the poorhouses were exposed to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Sidney D.|date=|title=From Almshouses to Nursing Homes and community care: Lessons from Medicaid History|url=http://readingroom.law.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2416&amp;context=gsulr|journal=Georgia State University Law Review|volume=26|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poorhouses were then replaced with a different type of residential living for the elderly. These new residential living homes were called board-and-care homes or also known as [[Convalescent Home|convalescent homes]]. These board-and-care homes would provide basic levels of care and meals in a private setting for a specific fee. Board-and-care homes proved to be a success and by [[World War II|World War 2]], the new way of nursing homes began to take shape. As the times continued to change,  the government identified the issue of people spending extensive amounts of time in hospitals. To combat these long stays in short-term settings, board-and-care homes began to convert into something more public and permanent that was state and federally funded. From this, by 1965 nursing homes were a solid fixture. Nursing homes were a permanent residence where the [[elderly]] and [[Disability|disabled]] (poor elderly and disabled specifically) could receive any necessary [[medical care]] and receive daily meals. Though nursing homes in the beginning were not perfect, they were a huge step above almshouses and poorhouses in regards to following laws and maintaining cleanliness. From the 1950s through the 1970s the dynamics of nursing homes began changing significantly. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] began to make up much of the money that would filter through the homes and the 1965 amendment laws enforced nursing homes to comply with safety codes and required [[registered nurse]]s to be on hand at all times. Later in 1987, the Nursing Reform Act was introduced to begin defining the different types of nursing home services and later added the Residents' Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.senioradvisor.com/blog/2015/05/history-of-nursing-homes/|title=History of Nursing Homes|last=|first=|date=|website=SeniorAdvisor.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today nursing homes are very different across the board. Some nursing homes still resemble a hospital while others look more like a home. Nursing home residents can pay for their care out of pocket, others may receive [[Medicare (United States)|medicare]] for a short time and some may use long-term [[insurance]] plans. Across the spectrum, most nursing homes will accept medicaid as a source of payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicare.gov/what-medicare-covers/part-a/paying-for-nursing-home-care.html|title=Paying for Nursing Home Care|last=|first=|date=|website=Medicare.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staff==
In most jurisdictions, nursing homes are required to provide enough staff to adequately care for residents. In the U.S., for instance, nursing homes must have at least one [[registered nurse]] RN available for at least 8 straight hours a day throughout the week, and at least one [[licensed practical nurse]] on duty 24 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skillednursingfacilities.org/|title=nursing home staff|publisher=skillednursingfacilities.org|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nurses ===
[[File:The Trained nurse and hospital review (1888) (14761734434).jpg|thumb]]
Nursing homes require that an RN be present to assess residents and to monitor their outcomes. The RN's job duties include implementing care plans, administering medications, recording and maintaining accurate reports for each resident, monitoring and recording medical changes and providing direction to the nursing assistant and licensed practical nurses or licensed vocational nurses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nursingworld.org/EspeciallyForYou/What-is-Nursing/Tools-You-Need/RNsAPNs.html|title=What Nurses Do|last=|first=|date=|website=American Nurses Association|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be allowed to work as a Registered Nurse, one must complete a nursing program at one of several educational levels, including associate and bachelor degree programs, hospital-based diploma programs and master's degree programs. Licensed practical nurses complete a state-approved one-year program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.practicalnursing.org/guides|title=How To Become an LPN/LPN|last=|first=|date=|website=PracticalNursing.org|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both registered nurses and licensed practical nurses must pass a national licensing exam before they can begin working. The LPN or LVN monitors residents’ well-being and administers treatments and medications, such as dressing wounds and dispensing prescribed drugs as directed by the Registered Nurse.&amp;nbsp;

=== Nursing assistants ===
[[File:Nurse takes a patient's blood pressure.jpg|thumb]]
A nursing assistant provides basic care to patients while working directly under an LPN/LVN or RN. These basic care activities, also referred to as activities of daily living, can include assisting with bathing and dressing residents, helping residents with meals, either serving them or with feeding, transferring to and from the bed or wheelchair, making and cleaning beds, assisting with toileting, and answering call lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allnursingschools.com/certified-nursing-assistant/job-description/|title=What You'll Do As A CNA|last=|first=|date=|website=AllNursingSchools.com|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training to become a nursing assistant is offered at some high schools, as well as at [[vocational-technical school]]s, community colleges, and nursing homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://everynurse.org/becoming-a-cna/|title=How to Become a CNA|last=|first=|date=|website=EveryNurse.org|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are typically three months to one year in length depending on the program. Nursing assistants are then listed on the state healthcare registry. Nursing assistants' titles can range from facility to facility, the job titles include Certified Nursing Assistants (CNA's), nursing aides, caregivers, patient care associates, patient care techs and care assistants

===Administration===
Depending on the size of the nursing home, a nursing home may have either a nursing home administrator or an [[executive director]]. Some nursing homes may have both but their job duties are similar and can include overseeing staff, supplying medical supplies and financial matters. The nursing home administrators/ executive director's career requires at least a [[bachelor's degree]] and some advanced positions may require a [[Master's degree|master’s degree]]. There are certain classes that are commonly taken in this path of study, these classes include nursing home administrative practices, [[Ageing|aging]] and long term care, [[gerontology]] and aging, and health behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://study.com/articles/Nursing_Home_Administrator_Job_Description_and_Info_for_Students_Considering_a_Career_in_Nursing_Home_Administration.html|title=Nursing Home Administrator|last=|first=|date=|website=Study.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; You may also find human resources employees in a nursing home. This job requires at least a bachelor's degree and usually preferred related work experience. These employees are in charge of all aspects of hiring new employees. Human resources job duties vary but can also include coordinating payroll, organizing orientation programs for new employees, interviewing, disciplinary actions, and ensuring compliance with federal and state laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mshealthcareers.com/careers/humanresources.htm|title=Human Resources|last=|first=|date=|website=HealthCareers.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing homes are usually licensed and heavily regulated under governing legislation. Compliance with the federal and state legislatures are reviewed regularly for adherence to strict standards of building codes, care plans, behavior and altercations between residents, nutrition and dietary services, medical services, nursing and personal care, religious and spiritual practices, pets, and recreational programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/ltc/docs/ltcha_guide_phase1.pdf

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Housekeeping ===
[[File:Good housekeeping 1908 08 a.jpg|thumb]]
Housekeepers are an important part of up keeping nursing homes. [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|Housekeepers]] play a huge part in ensuring that nursing homes are kept clean and free of [[Disease|disease causing agents]]. Housekeepers have a long list of duties which include cleaning floors, changing linens, disinfecting bathrooms, changing towels, washing clothes, emptying garbage cans, sanitizing rooms, replenishing supplies, dusting and polishing furniture, vacuuming, and keeping windows and woodwork clean. These duties can be &amp;nbsp;different from facility to facility but will overall include basic [[cleaning]]. Housekeeping does not require any licensure or schooling, but some housekeeping jobs may prefer prior job experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://work.chron.com/job-description-senior-living-housekeeper-30677.html|title=Job Description of Senior Living Housekeeper|last=|first=|date=|website=Work.Chron.Com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recreational staff ===
Recreational staff usually include  an activity director and possibly activity assistants depending on the size of the nursing home. The activity director job requires an [[associate degree]] or a [[bachelor's degree]] and allows for further [[certification]]s through the National Council for Therapeutic Recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://study.com/articles/Geriatric_Activities_Director_Job_Description_Duties_and_Requirements.html|title=Geriatric Activities Director Job Description|last=|first=|date=|website=Study.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activities are planned that aim to meet each residents [[emotion]]al, intellectual, physical, social, spiritual, and vocational needs. The transition from being independent to having to depend on others and be away from home is oftentimes very difficult, which is why activities are important to combat [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcknights.com/guest-columns/importance-of-being-social-in-a-nursing-home/article/358058/|title=Importance of Being Social in a Nursing Home|last=Petrea, RN|first=Jennifer|date=|website=McKnights|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the different activities that may be offered include hosting birthday parties, celebrating [[holiday]]s, book clubs, musical events, [[Outdoor recreation|outdoor activities]], discussion and social groups, [[Physical exercise|exercise]], arts and crafts, [[Animal-assisted therapy|pet therapy]], religious services and community outings. [[Volunteering|Volunteer]] involvement is also an important part of nursing home activities given that volunteers can act as a link between the nursing home and the outside community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theactivitydirectorsoffice.com/ActivitiesDefined.html|title=Activities Defined|last=|first=|date=|website=TheActivityDirectorsOffice.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Therapy ==
===Occupational therapy===
One&amp;nbsp;of the many services offered in a nursing home is [[occupational therapy]]. Occupational therapy may be necessary following an injury or illness in order to regain skills and to receive support during any physical or cognitive changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aota.org/About-Occupational-Therapy.aspx|title=About Occupational Therapy|last=|first=|date=|website=AOTA.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Occupational therapy will focus on activities of daily living such as&amp;nbsp;[[bathing]], dressing,&amp;nbsp;[[Personal grooming|grooming]]. Occupational therapy also assists with instrumental activities of daily living which include home and&amp;nbsp;[[financial management]], rest and sleep,&amp;nbsp;[[education]], work, play,&amp;nbsp;[[leisure]], and social participation. Occupational therapists work to allow the person to safely and comfortably reintegrate into society by practicing public dining, transferring to different surfaces (chairs, beds, couches etc.), and will assess the need for any home modifications or safety equipment to ensure a proper and safe transition. When a cognitive and/or perceptual deficit is presented, therapists will work with the person by teaching strategies to maximize memory, sequencing and attention span length.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aota.org/~/media/Corporate/Files/AboutOT/Professionals/WhatIsOT/RDP/Facts/FactSheet_SkilledNursingFacilities.pdf|title=Occupational Therapy's Role in Skilled Nursing Facility's|last=|first=|date=|website=AOTA.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical therapy===
[[File:Student nurses must be versed in occupational therapy 8b08195v.jpg|thumb]]
Another important service found in a nursing home is [[physical therapy]]. Physical therapy may be necessary following an injury, illness or surgery. Physical therapy works with the person  to help them regain strength, [[endurance]], [[Flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]], balance and [[range of motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://baystatept.com/news/how-do-i-know-if-i-should-see-physical-therapist|title=How Do I Know if I Should See a Physical Therapist|last=|first=|date=|website=BayStatePT.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical therapy is also used as a way of preventing [[Injury|injuries]] and accidents by focusing on restoring mobility, increasing fitness levels, reducing pain and overall reaching a certain point of independence. There are many conditions that can benefit from receiving physical therapy in a nursing home, these conditions include [[arthritis]], pain associated with [[cancer]], [[dementia]], [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]], [[stroke]] and [[Overactive bladder|incontinence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ling|first1=Shari M.|title=Rehabilitation of Older Adult Patients with Arthritis|url=https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/patient-corner/disease-management/rehabilitation-of-older-adult-patients-with-arthritis/|website=Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center|accessdate=29 July 2017|date=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physical Therapy|url=http://www.uhhospitals.org/stjohn/services/rehabilitation-services/physical-therapy|website=University Hospitals|publisher=St. John Medical Center|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Speech language therapy ===
[[File:Langley therapy dog.jpg|thumb]]
[[Speech-language pathology]] is another service found in a nursing home. Speech language [[List of pathologists|pathologists]] specialize in working with those who have a difficult time with language and/or speech, usually following an injury or an underlying [[Diagnosis|diagnoses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.speechpathology.com/articles/speech-language-pathology-in-long-1446|title=Speech Language Pathology in Long Term Care|last=|first=|date=|website=SpeechPathology.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SLP will evaluate the persons [[speech]]. If the person is having trouble with speech, this points to an issue with coordinating the movements and muscles used to produce speech. While trouble with language points to the person having difficulty with understanding what they are hearing and seeing. The SLP will also look at difficulty with [[swallowing]] food and will evaluate the person in order to figure out which part of the swallowing process is not working. Some of the many speech disorders worked with by the SLP are; [[Phonology]] meaning the speech patterns used, [[Apraxia]] meaning difficulty with coordinating the movements needed to make sounds, [[Language processing in the brain|Receptive Language]] meaning difficulty understanding language, Fluency meaning [[stuttering]], [[Expressive language|Expressive Language]] meaning difficulty using language and many other disorders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.superduperinc.com/handouts/pdf/162%20SLPs.pdf|title=What is a Speech Language Pathologist?|last=|first=|date=|website=superduperinc.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==

===Canada===
{{main|Nursing home care in Canada}}
[[Long-term care]] facilities exist under three major types: privately owned, non-profit/charitable, and municipal. Regardless of their ownership, aspects of funding, admission criteria, and cost to the individuals are all regulated by their respective provincial governments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oltca.com/OLTCA/Documents/Reports/TILTC2016.pdf

This is Long Term Care 2016&lt;/ref&gt; As medical care is publicly funded in Canada, all long-term care facilities receive funding from provincial governments for the health care component of the residence – the nurses and personal support workers. Residents pay daily rates for 'room and board' (accommodation and food) that are determined by the type of room chosen, either shared or private. Provincial governments manage waiting lists for long-term care facilities. People who cannot afford to pay the monthly fees receive subsidies, and no one is refused due to inability to pay.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ontario.ca/page/find-long-term-care-home

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Nursing home care in the United Kingdom}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], care homes and care homes with nursing are regulated by different organisations in [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. To enter a care home, a candidate patient needs an assessment of needs and of their financial condition from their local council. The candidate may also have an assessment by a [[nurse]], should the patient require nursing care. The cost of a care home is [[means tested]] in England.

Care homes for adults in England are regulated by [[Care Quality Commission]], which replaced the [[Commission for Social Care Inspection]], and each care home is inspected at least every three years. In Wales the Care Standards Inspectorate for Wales has responsibility for oversight, In Scotland [[Social Care and Social Work Improvement Scotland]] otherwise known as the Care Inspectorate, and in Northern Ireland the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority in Northern Ireland.

In 2002, nursing homes became known as care homes with nursing, and residential homes became known as care homes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |title=NHS Continuing Healthcare, NHS funded healthcare and intermediate care,|publisher= Age Concern |date= August 2007|url= http://www.ipbh.org.uk/healthsocialcare/documents/NHScontinuinghealthcareNHS-fundednursingcareandintermediatecare.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2009 in England, the lower capital limit is £13,500. At this level, all income from [[pension]]s, savings, benefits and other sources, except a "personal expenses allowance" (currently £21.90), goes towards paying the care home fees. The [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local council]] pays the remaining contribution provided the room occupied is not more expensive than the local council's normal rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Compare Care Homes Advice|title=‘Funding a Care Home’&amp;nbsp;– a comprehensive financial guidance leaflet from Comparecarehomes.com.|url=http://www.comparecarehomes.com/images/CCH-finance%20detailed.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NHS has full responsibility for funding the whole placement if the resident is in a care home with nursing that meets the criteria for NHS continuing Health Care. This is identified by a multidisciplinary assessment process.&lt;ref&gt;as detailed on the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---probably should expand to real citation--&gt;

In May 2010, the Coalition Government announced the formation of an [[Andrew Dilnot#Dilnot Commission|independent commission on the funding of long-term care]], which was due to report within a 12-month time frame on the financing of care for an [[Ageing population]].  It delivered its recommendations on Monday 4 July 2011. The [[Care Quality Commission]] have themselves implemented a re-registration process, completed in October 2010, which will result in a new form of regulation being outlined in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===United States===
{{main|Nursing home care in the United States}}
In the United States, there are three main types of nursing facilities (NFs).

An intermediate care facility (ICF) is a health care facility for individuals who are disabled, elderly, or non-acutely ill, usually providing less intensive care than that offered at a hospital or skilled nursing facility. Typically an ICF is privately paid by the individual or by the individual's family. An individual's private health insurance and/or a third party service like a [[hospice]] company may cover the cost. '''Board and Care Homes''' are special facilities designed to provide those who require assisted living services both living quarters and proper care. Often referred to as residential care homes, these facilities can either be located in a small residential home or a large modern facility. In fact, a large majority of board and care homes are designed to room less than 6 people.  Board and care homes are typically staffed by licensed professionals, including nurses, doctors and other medical professionals. These facilities are highly regulated in order to ensure that the best possible care is being provided for the residents. Board and care homes offer residents 24 hour assistance, making them a highly popular choice for those in need of regular assistance.

[[Assisted living residences]] or [[assisted living facilities]] (ALFs) are housing facilities for people with [[disabilities]]. These facilities provide supervision or assistance with [[activities of daily living]] (ADLs); ALFs are an eldercare alternative on the continuum of care for people, for whom independent living is not appropriate but who do not need the 24-hour medical care provided by a nursing home and are too young to live in a retirement home. Assisted living is a philosophy of care and services promoting independence and dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullcirclecare.org/ltcontinuum/nursing.html |title=ltcontinuum |publisher=fullcirclecare.org |date= |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A skilled nursing facility (SNF) is a nursing home certified to participate in, and be reimbursed by [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].  Medicare is the federal program primarily for the aged (65+) who contributed to Social Security and Medicare while they were employed. [[Medicaid]] is the federal program implemented with each state to provide health care and related services to those who are below the poverty line. Each state defines poverty and, therefore, Medicaid eligibility. Those eligible for Medicaid may be low-income parents, children, including [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]]s (SCHIPs) and maternal-child wellness and food programs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} seniors, and people with disabilities.

The [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] is the component of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS) that oversees Medicare and Medicaid. A large portion of Medicare and Medicaid dollars is used each year to cover nursing home care and services for the elderly and disabled. State governments oversee the licensing of nursing homes. In addition, states have a contract with CMS to monitor those nursing homes that want to be eligible to provide care to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Congress established minimum requirements for nursing homes that want to provide services under Medicare and Medicaid. These requirements are broadly outlined in the Social Security Act, which also entrusts the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the responsibility of monitoring and enforcing these requirements. CMS is also charged with the responsibility of working out the details of the law and how it will be implemented, which it does by writing regulations and manuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicare.gov/|title=Nursing Home Inspections|publisher=medicare.gov|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Odontis''' was an English dental company started by Professor Paul Sharpe, in association with [[King's College London]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The company was focused on a technology of treating dental problems by using [[stem cell]]s.

The idea was to use stem cells to grow new teeth that could replace missing teeth. The new [[tooth]] would be alive and nearly identical to the one that is missing.

The technology, if proved successful, would have huge potential as it will enable the maintenance of healthy teeth virtually throughout an entire lifetime. The new teeth of the patient will be exactly the same as his own. This will make it possible to avoid many problems that can be faced with artificial [[Dental implant|implants]].

The technology would also bring new business opportunities for dentists and the companies in the field.

In 2004 the company claimed to have achieved the first promising results in an experiment with a mouse. The scientists have successfully implanted stem cells into a [[Gingiva|gum]] of a mouse and managed to grow a new tooth. Statements were made that the technology for growing new teeth would be available to the public in the near future, and as a result, an award of five hundred thousand pounds was made;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=New teeth 'could soon be grown'|website=bbc.co.uk|date=3 May 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3679313.stm|accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however since the claim, nothing further has emerged.

[[Image:Operating theatre.jpg|350px|thumb|right|An operating theatre (gynecological hospital of [[Medical University of Silesia]][[Bytom]])]]
'''Operating room management''' is the science of how to run an [[Operating Room]] Suite. '''Operational operating room management''' focuses on maximizing operational [[wikt:efficiency|efficiency]] at the facility, i.e. to maximize the number of surgical cases that can be done on a given day while minimizing the required resources and related costs. For example, what is the number of required [[anaesthetists]] or the scrub nurses that are needed next week to accommodate the expected workload or how can we minimize the cost of drugs used in the [[Operating Room]]? '''Strategic operating room management''' deals with long-term [[decision-making]]. For example, is it profitable to add two additional rooms to the existing facility? Typically, operating room management in profit-oriented health-care systems (e.g. United States) emphasizes strategic thinking whereas in countries with [[publicly funded health care]] (e.g. the UK), the focus is on operational decisions.&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh C, Dexter F, Epstein RH. Impact of service-specific staffing, case scheduling, turnovers, and first-case starts on anesthesia group and operating room productivity: tutorial using data from an Australian hospital. Anesth Analg. 2006;103:1499–1516.&lt;/ref&gt;

The act of coordinating and running all parts of a surgical suite to accomplish a defined set of goals.  An emerging field, operating room management is increasingly studied as how to best: 
1) ensure patient safety and optimal patient outcome, 
2) provide surgeons with appropriate access to the OR so that patients can have operations in a timely manner,
3) maximize the efficiency of [[operating room utilization]], staff, and materials,
4) decrease patient delays,
5) enhance satisfaction among patients, staff, and physicians.

This management science as applied to the surgical suite is gaining more attention because of increasing market pressures on hospitals from competitors (e.g., other surgical suites including office based surgery) and from payers seeking lower prices.  The surgical suite is often considered a profitable hospital unit. As such, surgical suites also comprise an important fraction of hospital [[budget]] spending. Holding [[patient safety]] constant, the opportunity to increase financial gain through modifying the use of already existing resources is a prime target for managerial analysis.  Incremental improvements in [[operating room utilization]] and [[operating room efficiency]] can have major impacts on hospital staff and finances. Some hospital administrators perceive efficiency in the operating room as throughput, completing the most surgical cases within [[budget]]. Later in this article we will provide examples of tools a manager may use to analyze efficiency.

==Surgical suite personnel==
The management of a surgical suite must take into account all cooperating team members. The operating environment consists of interaction between surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, technicians, and patients.

==The necessity of management==
Overhead costs include, but are not limited to, the space, technology and devices, pharmaceuticals and staffing.  Hospital administrators have consequently focused their attention towards maximizing OR profitability, and thereby hospital profitability, through [[contribution margins]]. This focus, in addition to the boom in demand for elective surgery, has led to a rapid growth of OR facilities.  Historically, nurses have been chiefly responsible for the daily functioning of the surgical suite.  Increasingly, facilities are hiring a physician medical director for the OR, as represented by a surgeon, anesthesiologist, or both. In some instances, all three branches of surgery, anesthesia, and nursing will be represented in the daily OR management infrastructure. By working collegially, these three fields can mobilize all resources necessary to maximize OR [[productivity]]. Because medical needs and regulatory requirements are constantly changing, the concept of appointing a [[medical director]] in the OR, an operating room manager, has gained acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Siciliani, L., Hurst, J. Tackling excessive waiting times for elective surgery: a comparative analysis of policies in 12 OECD countries. Health Policy 2005; 72:201-215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinicians typically focus on operational decisions on the day of surgery (short term) such as moving cases from one OR to another, assigning and relieving staff, prioritizing urgent cases, and scheduling add-on case.  On the other hand, upper management typically focuses on strategic decision making (long term) such as whether to open a new cancer center, or whether to align the hospital with a regional health care system.

==Principles of operating room management==
The decisions made by OR management should have a clear and definitive purpose in order to maintain consistency. In order of priority, governing principles of OR managers are to: (1) ensure patient safety and the highest quality of care; (2) provide surgeons with appropriate access to the OR; (3) maximize the efficiency of operating room [[utilization]], staff, and materials to reduce costs; (4) decrease patient delays; and (5) enhance satisfaction among patients, staff, and physicians.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Dexter, F. et al. An operating room scheduling strategy to maximize the use of operating room block time: computer simulation of patient scheduling and survey of patients’ preferences for surgical waiting time. Anesth Analg. 1999; 89:7-20.&lt;/ref&gt; If OR management is properly performed ahead of time, all that doctors and nurses have to think about on the day of surgery is the patient. If management is poor, then the medical and nursing staff may waste efforts and resources to rush cases or juggle schedules, thus compromising attention to [[patient safety]].

==Operating room utilization==
'''OR utilization''' is a measure of the use of an [[operating room]] that is properly staffed with people needed to successfully deliver a surgical procedure to a patient.

'''Block Utilization''' is a measure of the use of operating room time by a surgeon or group of surgeons to whom time has been allocated.

''Raw utilization'' is the total hours of elective cases performed within OR time divided by the hours of allocated block time.

'''Raw Utilization = total hours of cases performed ÷ total hours of OR time allocated'''

''Adjusted utilization'' uses the total hours of elective cases performed within OR block time, including "credit" for the turnover times necessary to set up and clean up ORs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Dexter F, Traub R. How to Schedule Elective Surgical Cases into Specific Operating Rooms to Maximize the Efficiency of Use of Operating Room Time. Anesth Analg 2002; 94: 933-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adjusted Utilization = [total hours of cases + "credit time"] ÷ total hours of OR time allocated'''

Factors affecting utilization rates include: 
the accuracy of estimated case times, 
cancellation rate, 
number of add-ons available to fill gaps, 
longest cases go first, 
the time of day as utilization typically is highest in the morning and lowest in the evening, outpatient centers have lower utilization, and other constraints (i.e., surgeon can only use room 12, or start at 11&amp;nbsp;am).

Improvements in operating room efficiency can have a major impact on hospital staff and finances as well as operating room management.

==Operating room efficiency==
Operating room (OR) efficiency is a measure of how well time and resources are used for their intended purposes. One way to analyze efficiency is to chart ''under-utilized'' and ''over-utilized'' time spent on a given day in the [[operating room]]. If the cases in an operating room finish earlier than scheduled, time is ''under-utilized''. Likewise, if the cases in an operating room run "late" or past its allotted operating room time then this produces ''over-utilized time''.&lt;ref&gt;Dexter F, et al. Use of Operating Room Information System Data to Predict the Impact of Reducing Turnover Times on Staffing Costs. Anesth Analy 2003; 97:1119-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Dexter F, Willemsen-Dunlap A, Lee J. Operating Room Managerial Decision-Making on the Day of Surgery With and Without Computer Recommendations and Status Displays.  Anesth Analg 2007; 105:419-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''operating room utilization'' and ''operating room productivity'' are also often used when discussing operating room management of a surgical suite.

===Performance dashboard for a surgical suite===
An operating room manager must select criteria, key performance indicators, or a dashboard of measurements, to assess overall functioning of a surgical suite. An example of an analytic tool used to rate surgical suites is reflected below. This scoring system was created in order to quantify the efficiency levels of surgical suites. Its economical efficacy has yet to be validated by formal studies. In addition, it was developed in the US and contains scoring elements that are applicable for an American surgical suite. It is therefore unlikely to be useful for operating room managers outside the US.

The above objective criteria can be computed from data commonly available in hospital administrative data systems.

===Excess staffing costs===
Nothing is more important than to first allocate the right amount of OR time to each service on each day of the week for their case scheduling. This is not the same as the block time! To illustrate this imagine that two cases each lasting 2 hours are scheduled into OR #1 with OR nurses and an anesthesiologist scheduled to work an 8 hr day. The matching of workload to staffing has been so poor that little can be done the day of surgery to increase the efficiency of use of the staff. Neither awakening patients more quickly nor reducing the turnover time, for example, will compensate for the poor initial choice of staffing for OR #1 and/or how the cases were scheduled into OR #1.

Optimal allocation of OR time should be based on historical use by a particular service (i.e., unit of OR allocation such as surgeon, group, department, or specialty) and then using computer software to minimize the amount of underutilized time and the more expensive overutilized time.  Under-utilized hours reflect how early the room finishes.  In the example above, if staff were scheduled to work from 7:00&amp;nbsp;am to 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm and instead the room finished at 11&amp;nbsp;am, then there would be 4 hours of underutilized time.  The excess staffing cost would be 50% (4 hours/8 hours).  On the other hand, if 9 hours of cases are performed in an OR with staff scheduled to work 8 hours then the excess staffing cost is 25%. Over-utilized hours are the hours that ORs run longer than the regularly scheduled OR hours, or 1 hr in this example. 1hr/8hr=12.5% which is then multiplied by the additional cost of staying late, which often is assumed to be a factor of two (related to monetary overtime cost paid to staff, as well as recruitment and retention costs related to unhappy staff because they have to stay late unpredictably).
OR suites can reasonably aim to achieve a staffing cost that is within 10% of optimal (i.e., workload is perfectly matched to staffing).

If the key is to allocate appropriate time to each service based on historical OR use, how do you deal with rooms consistently running late on the day of surgery?  The answer: make the allocated time, into which cases are being scheduled, longer.  For example, if a surgeon does 12 hours worth of cases every day he is in the OR, don’t plan 8 hours of staffing (7am-3pm) and have everyone frustrated by having to stay late (overtime). Rather, schedule his cases into 12 hours of allocated time (7am-7pm). That way, anesthesia and nursing staff know they will be there 12 hours when they arrive to work and overtime costs (financial and morale) will be reduced. The common response to this approach is, “No one wants to be there till 7&amp;nbsp;pm.” The answer to that is, “You are there now till 7&amp;nbsp;pm so why not make scheduled OR time 12 hr long and have a more predictable work day duration.”  Thus, optimizing staffing costs is finding balance between overtime and finishing early.

There may be concern about a nurse manager's ability to flex the staff enough to avoid excess staffing costs. It can be difficult from a human resources standpoint to match scheduled cases with staffing perfectly, such that staff still get the hours and shifts they need. For example, if Dr Smith needs a 12-hour block, the manager needs to find staff who want to work a 12-hour shift (or part-timers in some combination).  Staffing is not only an OR efficiency issue, but a staff satisfaction issue. It can be a challenge at a time when recruiting and retaining nurses are growing concerns.

===Start-time tardiness===
Start-time tardiness is the mean tardiness of start times for elective cases per OR per day. Reducing the time patients have to wait for their surgery once they arrive to the hospital (especially if the preceding case runs late) is another important goal for the OR manager. If a case is supposed to start at 10:00&amp;nbsp;am (patient enters OR), but the case starts at 10:30&amp;nbsp;am instead, then there are 30 minutes of tardiness.  In computing this metric, no credit is given if the 10:00&amp;nbsp;am case starts early (for example at 9:45&amp;nbsp;am).

The tardiness of start of scheduled cases should total less than 45 mins per eight-hour OR day in well functioning OR suites.  Facilities with long work days will have greater tardiness because the longer the day, the more uncertainty about case start times. Having patients’ medical records ready to go with all needed documents is essential for on time starts.

===Case cancellation rate on day of surgery===
Cancellation rates vary among facilities, depending partly on the types of patients receiving care, ranging from 4.6% for outpatients, to 13% -18% at VA medical centers. Recently published data from the UK estimate that 1 in 10 patients presenting for inpatient surgery have experienced a previous cancellation for their procedure, and that 1 in 7 patients being operated on had their procedure cancelled during a 1 week period in March 2017 in the UK National Health Service (NHS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=D.J.N.|last2=Harris|first2=S.K.|last3=Moonesinghe|first3=S.R.|date=2018-09|title=Cancelled operations: a 7-day cohort study of planned adult inpatient surgery in 245 UK National Health Service hospitals|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0007091218305658|journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia|doi=10.1016/j.bja.2018.07.002|issn=0007-0912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillies|first=M.A.|last2=Wijeysundera|first2=D.N.|last3=Harrison|first3=E.M.|date=2018-09|title=Counting the cost of cancelled surgery: a system wide approach is needed|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0007091218306433|journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia|doi=10.1016/j.bja.2018.08.002|issn=0007-0912}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cancellations are due to non-medical problems such as a full ICU, surgeon unavailability, or bad weather. OR cancellation rates can be monitored statistically. Well functioning OR suites should have cancellation rates less than 5%. Monitoring the cancellations correctly is calculated by taking the ratio of the number of cancellations to the number of scheduled cases.

===PACU admission delays===
PACU admission delays can be expressed as a % of workdays with at least one delay of 10 mins or greater in PACU admission because PACU is full. It is important to adjust PACU nurse staffing around the times of OR admissions. Algorithms exist that use the number of available nursing hours to find the staffing solution with the fewest number of understaffed days.

===Contribution margin per OR hour===
An OR suite that puts up with excessive surgical times can schedule itself efficiently but still lose its financial shirt if many surgeons are slow, use too many instruments, or expensive implants, etc. These are all measured by the contribution margin per OR hr.  The contribution margin per hour of OR time is the hospital revenue generated by a surgical case, less all the hospitalization variable labor and supply costs. Variable costs, such as implants, vary directly with the volume of cases performed.

This is because fee-for-service hospitals have a positive contribution margin for almost all elective cases mostly due to a large percentage of OR costs being fixed.  For USA hospitals not on a fixed annual budget, contribution margin per OR hour averages one to two thousand USD per OR hour.

===Turnover times===
Turnover time is the time from when one patient exits an OR until the next patient enters the same OR.  Turnover times include cleanup times and setup times, but not delays between cases. Based on data collected at 31 USA hospitals, turnover times at the best performing OR suites average less than 25 mins.   Cost reduction from reducing turnover times (because OR workload is less) can only be achieved if OR allocations and staffing are reduced.  Despite this, turnover time receives lots of attention from OR managers because it is a key satisfier for surgeons.

Sometimes the OR suite reduces turnover times (by providing more staff to clean the room for example) but new problems arise (not enough time for sterilizing instruments for the new case, can’t bring patient to PACU because no beds) that were “hidden” by long turnover times.

Times between cases that are longer than a defined interval (e.g., 1 hr because to follow surgeon is unavailable) should be considered delays, not turnovers.

===Prediction bias===
Prediction bias in case duration are expressed as estimates per 8 hr of OR time. Prediction error equals the actual duration of the new case minus the estimated duration of the new case. Bias indicates whether the estimate is consistently too high or consistently too low, and precision reflects the magnitudes of the errors of the estimates.  Efficient OR suites should aim to have bias in case duration estimates per 8 hr of OR time that is less than 15 minutes.    A reason for bias can be surgeons’ consistently shortening their case duration estimates because they have too little OR time allocated and need to “fit” their list of cases into the OR time they do have. In contrast, other OR suites may have surgeons that purposely overestimate case durations to keep control/access of their allocated OR time so that if a new case appears their OR time was not given away.

Remember that lack of historical case duration data for scheduled procedures is an important cause of inaccuracy in predicting case duration.  In general, half of the cases scheduled in your OR suite tomorrow will have less than five previous cases of the same procedure type and same surgeon during the preceding year.

It would be nice to have no uncertainty in case duration prediction. But, it is present. The problem is looking for a single number that is correct most of the time.  You won't get accurate estimates by using historical case duration data. Rather, from the historical data you'll get an assessment of the uncertainty.

===Prolonged turnovers===
Times between cases that are longer than a defined interval. (note: late arrival of a surgeon should be considered delays, not turnovers.)

==Operating room productivity==
''Operating room productivity'' is the quantity and quality of output (typically surgical cases) from the surgical suite in contrast to the amount of input required (such as physicians and nurses and equipment for example). Many institutions believe that productivity (output/input) can be accomplished without sacrificing convenience (rapid access to open OR time such that a surgeon can book a case without having to wait) but these two aspects are not separable.

Typically, the greater the ''operating room utilization'', the less the convenience (able to book cases when desired) as defined by surgeons and patients. This is because as utilization goes up there is less available open staffed OR time available on short notice. In other words, the greater the access and convenience, the lower is ''operating room utilization'' (because of the need for extra capacity), at least as perceived by hospitals and anesthesiologists. This high level of customer service of being able to book cases on short notice is one reason ambulatory surgery centers typically have lower OR utilization than big city hospitals.  The outpatient surgery center usually has reduced overhead when compared to a big city hospital, and therefore can financially get away with lower OR use.

==Sociopolitical factors in management of the surgery suite: ''"OR Equilibrium"''==
Management of the operating room suite must acknowledge that people are the primary resource.  Although management science theory may tend to hold constant the preferences and bias of the individuals working in and utilizing the surgery suite, management of the surgical suite with regards to case scheduling is strongly influenced by personal, political, and economic relationships within an institution.

==Who is the main customer of your surgical suite?==
To best align management goals with institutional objectives the OR director needs to identify the primary customer of the surgical suite. An OR can be completely balanced or it can be biased to one or more its constituents. The main people to consider are surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, the hospital (upper management), and of course the patient.

A first step is to determine whose preferences or workload dominates the surgical suite. If surgeons are in large demand with small supply, then that may outweigh other interests. For example, a private facility may have surgeons who can pull their patients to another hospital if made to wait. As another example, in a private surgeon-owned surgery center, management may be directed as maintaining a particular partner's workload and the incentives are to schedule his/her cases with priority.

The same supply/demand balance applies to anesthesia. The situation may exist where a specific surgery group will only work with its contracted anesthesia group.  In this case, a manager may have to wait until the contracted anesthesiologist is ready for the case, even if this means idle OR time. This can be avoided in institutions where one group has exclusive rights and controls anesthesia privilege over all the ORs. This arrangement is seen commonly because it eliminates factions and streamlines anesthesia placement for cases, either elective or emergency.

Hospital (Upper Management) run ORs are identified by those facilities where the hospital executives acting as agents for government authorities determine staffing and workload. Examples include hospitals in public health care systems like in European countries or the VA [[United States Department of Veteran Affairs]] in the USA.

In other surgical suites, in contrast, management decisions have patients as the first priority.  Facilities performing elective cosmetic procedures for cash reimbursement are an example. Due to the patient being able to choose where they have plastic surgery, patients expect special circumstances such as first-rate customer service. Additionally, if a patient is one hour late for surgery the patient will most likely still be able to undergo surgery. This concept is in contrast to a large academic hospital, for example, where a patient who misses their check-in window for elective surgery is often removed from the surgery schedule to make room for re-shuffled elective and emergency cases.

==What are the preferences of the main customer in the surgical suite?==
Once the manager has identified the critical few customers and the necessary many customers, then the next step is to determine their preferences and incentives. Surgeons will favor early block surgery times, rapid turnover, low cancellation rates, and on time starts. The hospital (upper management) will want the most surgical output with the least associated cost. Patients will likely favor reduced waiting times for surgery start. Finally, nurse managers and anesthesiologists will be inclined to high [[operating room utilization]], minimal overtime, the flexibility to move cases around, and reserve capacity in the ORs.

Much like economic [[Game Theory]], agents in the OR will position their interests in a nature as to maximize their returns. It is up to the OR manager to weigh the contributions of each agent and provide enough OR time and resources to maximize the output of the surgical suite in its entirety.

==Theory and applications of operating room management==
This discussion addresses capitalistic healthcare markets. A discussion of [[socialized medicine]] would include several other factors which influence the supply and demand for surgical care.  Analysis of operating room management within [[socialized medicine]] is becoming increasingly frequent in the medical literature, but is beyond the scope of this article.

A manager must select benchmarks in order to analyze changes from baseline operations. Upgrades to existing operating infrastructures should be demonstrated as efficiency gained compared to baseline practices. Management criteria must therefore include preoperative, intraoperative, and immediate postoperative system analysis.

==Preoperative management issues==
''Waiting time'' and ''operating room scheduling'' are the two key preoperative determinates.

'''Waiting time prior to operation''' The time from surgical scheduling to check-in for the procedure is defined, for these purposes, as “preoperative wait time.”

Use of a surgical suite depends greatly on, and increases as, the average length of time patients wait for surgery increases. As waiting time increases, more surgical dates (blocks) can be evaluated for a good match between a case's duration and the open times in the blocks. In some communities, competition among surgeons and hospitals may not allow the average length of time that patients have to wait for surgery to be as long as 2 weeks. An OR suite then cannot expect block time utilization from elective cases to exceed 90%, assuming that enough block time is allocated for a surgeon to complete all of the elective cases in the block time.

For these purposes, wait time can be equated to the price of an object. The price for an object increases if demand increases and/or supply reduces for that object. Hence, “preoperative wait time” will increase as demand for surgery increases and/or surgical supply (operating room availability) reduces or fails to grow proportionally to surgical demand.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

By accurately gauging a patient population and an operative facility’s capacity, an effective manager can minimize the wait for elective and imminent procedures while covering all emergency cases and without overextending the operative team.

==Scheduling operating room calendars==
Case scheduling or correctly selecting the day on which to do each elective case so as to best fill the allocated hours is most important, much more so than, for example, correcting errors in predicting how long elective or add-on cases would last, reducing variability in turnover or delays between cases, or day-to-day variation in hours of add-on cases.&lt;ref&gt;Dexter, F. et al. Tactical decision making for selective expansion of operating room resources incorporating financial criteria and uncertainty in subspecialties’ future workloads. Anesth Analg. 2005; 100:1425-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poor scheduling is often the cause of lost OR time. To more efficiently operate a surgical setting, managers may consider centralizing all scheduling to the operating room suite itself.  Ideally, holding patient and surgeon preferences constant, an operating facility can identify cases and appropriately place them into predetermined time slots, or blocks.

To examine scheduling challenges, consider three possible surgical scenarios: elective (e.g. cosmetic procedures, stable situations not increasing in severity), imminent (e.g. inflamed gall bladder removal, potential for worsening harm if situations not surgically corrected,) and emergency surgeries (e.g. burst appendix, situations in which death or disability is possible or likely). The majority of operative time is a combination of elective and imminent surgeries. Albeit a smaller percentage, emergency surgical cases must always be handled promptly in order to ensure patient safety. Emergency surgeries are often unforeseeable and present a scheduling challenge as a result.  Therefore, from a management perspective, one must use the elective and imminent surgical cases as a guideline for pre-determining operative schedules, while allowing flexibility for the emergency situations that indubitably arise.

The historical approach for scheduling operating room time is via analysis of previous surgical information. For example, to estimate how much time a [[cholecystectomy]] will require, the management determines how long previous [[cholecystectomy]] operations took the participating surgeon. Limiting this approach is the number of prior recorded cases and the surgeon’s familiarity with the procedure.  Previously recorded information serves to set a precedent for turnover rates. By allowing surgeons to operate efficiently based on their previous timetables, a manager allows all parties involved to work more efficiently.

Nothing is more important than to first allocate the right amount of OR time to each service on each day of the week so that rarely do services fill their allocated OR time and have another case to schedule. This allocation is based on historical use by surgeon and then using computer to minimize ratio of underutilized time and over-utilized time (which is more expensive).

A prevailing school of thought is for managers to allocate operating room time based on the principles of safety, access and [[operating room efficiency]], in respective order of importance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  Part of a manager’s job is to clearly communicate these factors to all parties involved in care delivery.

There are times when a departmental manager must realize a departure from this practice and intervene to save profitability margins. For instance, an anesthesia practice group may negotiate extra funds from their employer (university, hospital, multi-specialty medical groups) to compensate for underutilized operating room time.  In this instance, an anesthesia manager may use predetermined formulas to estimate excess labor costs they incur that are not offset by proper [[operating room utilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Abouleish A, et al. Labor Costs Incurred by Anesthesiology Groups Because of Operating Rooms Not Being Allocated and Cases Not Being Scheduled Maximize Operating Room Efficiency. Anesth Analg 2003; 96: 1109-13.&lt;/ref&gt; A manager, whether departmental of administrative, that uses proactive applications can eliminate inefficiencies within their operating systems.

==Intraoperative management issues==
Managers need to evaluate: 1) operating room leadership; 2) departmental leadership within the operating room; 3) interpersonal conflicts amongst the operating team; 4) physical layout and location of the operating room in relation to other integral departments; 5) operating room communication systems; and 6) patient turnover.&lt;ref&gt;Calmes, S. Operating room management: what goes wrong and how to fix it.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only then can options such as providing rewards and incentives for improved [[operating room efficiency]], assessing logistical and system design, delegating responsibility, and implementing teamwork initiatives be instituted to produce more favorable outcomes for both the provider and the patient.

==Surgical suite leadership==
Generally, an institution or private surgery center will have an agreed upon leader, generally dubbed the “Operating Room Manager.” The reporting structure is typically to a VP of surgical services. A manager may have the business and academic ability to operate a facility, but without the cooperation of staff and practitioners, most reform efforts will be futile.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

An OR manager must be in compliance with several internal and external governing bodies. Depending on the institution, a given manager may have to work closely with committees ranging from patient safety and medical staff safety boards to an auxiliary OR committee.  The [[Joint Commission]] on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) puts forth an external, universal regulatory standard for hospitals and ORs. An OR manager must maintain compliance with this spectrum of policies in order to maintain both patient safety as well as hospital accreditation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
One of many notable policies put forth by JHACO [Joint Commission] is the universal protocol, implemented to ensure patient safety. This protocol requires that three sequential events must be completed prior to surgical incision in order to reduce iatrogenic errors and postoperative complications. The three checkpoints are (1) preoperative verification of procedure and background information, (2) marking of the operative site with a marker and surgeon’s initials, and (3) an official timeout for an audible confirmation of patient identity and the procedure to be completed. These regulations have proven to reduce avoidable complications of intraoperative mistakes and resultant postoperative morbidities and mortalities.

==Departmental leadership within the surgical suite==
This topic compartmentalizes each member of a surgical suite team to his/her department (e.g. surgery, anesthesiology, environmental services, housekeeping, etc.). The principle behind departmental leadership is the delegation of responsibility. An operating room manager must rely upon departments to uphold their respective regulations in addition to acting in the best interest of the overall institution. This interest directly relates to [[operating room utilization]] and [[operating room productivity]]. Therefore, a surgical chief must be an active member of scheduling block time for surgery in order to avoid persistent over or underutilization of resources.

==Interpersonal conflicts amongst the surgical suite team==
The majority of accidents in technical professions have human error as causal elements. More critically, these errors tend to involve interpersonal issues: communications, leadership, conflict, flawed decision making, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Macario, Alex. Are You Hospital Operating Rooms “Efficient”?. Anesthesiology 2006; 105:237-40.&lt;/ref&gt;  A questionnaire circulated to operating room staff and professionals identified communication problems as an overwhelming barrier to operating room performance.&lt;ref&gt;Strum DP, Vargas LG, May JH, Bashein G. Surgical suite utilization and capacity planning: a minimal cost analysis model. J Med Syst 1997;21:309-22.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is a constant theme within healthcare and can disrupt an operating room and detract from [[operating room efficiency]].  It is imperative that a manager optimize personal issues and act quickly to correct them.

==Physical layout and location of the surgical suite in relation to other integral departments (i.e. radiology, pathology, etc.)==
An effective manager must analyze the layout of each operating room individually and as a whole. The mass of new technologies and equipment, such as Endoscopic surgical procedures, in today's operating room is increasing. Crowding may adversely affect the abilities of the surgical team.&lt;ref&gt;Alarcon A, Berguer R. A comparison of operating room crowding between open and laparoscopic operations. Surgical Endoscopy 1996;10(9):916-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Managers must act to appropriately modify pre-existing operating room space or by identifying key design issues during the conception and building of new facilities. Larger cases where more materials and instruments are used should be appropriately scheduled into rooms that can accommodate them.

Likewise, the surgical suite ideally is placed in close proximity to support functions such as radiology, pathology, and intensive care.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  Creating unnecessary distance between these entities compromises both [[operating room efficiency]] and [[patient safety]].

Surgical Suite Communication Systems and Patient Turnover

Current technologies provide managers with tools to reduce patient turnover rate. Standard practices include passive status displays (whiteboards or screens in the surgical suites) and active displays (text pager notifications). These communication tools streamline interdisciplinary planning for real time decision-making. A recent study suggests going further and implementing a system of command displays (text suggestions of how to act)&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; or even patient tracking systems such as with RFID tags.  This communication is essential to know when to expect patients to arrive to the holding area prior to entering the OR, or to the recovery room after surgery.

Reduction in turnover time (patient exists operating room until next patient enters operating room) requires all individuals in the surgical suite to work together.  The day-to-day management of [[operating room efficiency]] is integral to the maximization of both qualitative (improved professional satisfaction) and quantitative (completion of more cases and reduced staffing costs) returns.&lt;ref&gt;Helmreich R, Davies J. Human Factors in the Operating Room: Interpersonal Determinants of Safety, Efficiency, and Morale. Balliere’s Clinical Anaesthesiology. London:Balliere Tindall, in press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postoperative operating room management==
[[Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP)]]

SCIP is a national partnership of organizations [www.medqic.org/scip] that are dedicated to reducing postoperative complications.

The project focuses on four broad areas in which the incidence and cost of complications are high: (1) Surgical site infections, (2) Perioperative myocardial infarctions (heart attacks), (3) Venous thromboembolism, and (4) Postoperative pneumonia.

An operating room manager must consider the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative factors which reflect in patient safety and hospital efficiency.  Ideally, a manager is approachable, intelligent, and an effective leader who communicates well with hospital staff. The above techniques and principles highlight many of the ways in which a manager can successfully direct a surgical suite to maximize its benefit to the patients, staff and hospital.

==Notes==
1. One possible solution to intrapersonal conflict within the operating theatre is medical simulation training. Large institutions are adapting simulator practices to teach everything from communication skills to proper clinical management of crises situations. By identifying interpersonal barriers in a closed environment, a manager can work with all parties involved to address and resolve these problems. Such interventions will reduce intraoperative error as a result of personal conflicts and serve to increase efficiency.

2.  Ultimately, a manager may improve hospital functioning by providing rewards and incentives for improved efficiency, assessing logistical and system design, delegating responsibility, and implementing teamwork initiatives.  These topics are beyond the scope of this article.

'''Prudence Barron''' [[MBE]] [[FRCSEd]] (16 September 1917 – 10 October 2014) was a surgeon at the [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh]] and [[geriatrician]].

==Early life and education==
Prudence Halton was born in [[Poona]], Maharashtra, in India on 16 September 1917.&lt;ref name="BMJ obit"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barron|first=Richard|date=2015|title=Obituary. Prudence Barron.|url=https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.h155|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=350|pages=55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Colonel Frederick Halton,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C700521|title=Lieutenant Colonel Frederick William Halton. The Border Regiment.|last=Archives|first=The National|date=|website=discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in peacetime was a solicitor and later the coroner for Cumberland, had been stationed on the North West Frontier during the  [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]]. Educated as a boarder at [[Cheltenham Ladies’ College]] from the age of 12, she became a prefect and then head of house. Her mother encouraged her to apply to the [[London School of Medicine for Women]] and she was accepted in 1936, carrying out her undergraduate clinical training at the [[Royal Free Hospital]].&lt;ref name="Scotsman"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-prudence-barron-mbe-frcs-edin-mb-bs-lond-surgeon-and-geriatrician-1-3621660|title=Prue Barron; surgeon and geriatrician|last=Halton Barron|first=Richard|date=2 December 2014|work=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=24 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surgical career==
She graduated with an MB, BS in 1942 and worked in house officer posts at the [[Cumberland Infirmary]] in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]. She then took up the position of  clinical assistant to [[Gertrude Herzfeld]], the first practising woman surgeon in Scotland, at the [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh|Royal Hospital for Sick Children]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name = "BMJ obit"/&gt; In July 1945 became a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | title=List of fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh: from the year 1581 to 31st December 1873 | url=https://archive.org/details/b21465812 | year=1874 | publisher=Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh | accessdate=4 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She returned to Cumberland Infirmary as assistant surgical resident for a year, before becoming surgical resident at [[Birmingham Children's Hospital|Birmingham Children’s Hospital]], where she assisted in the first paediatric [[Cardiac surgery|open heart surgery]] to be performed at the hospital. Barron was invited back to Edinburgh by Herzfeld, and was appointed senior surgical registrar at [[Bruntsfield Hospital]] in October 1947. She supplemented her salary by demonstrating anatomy to medical students at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name ="BMJ obit"/&gt;
 
==Subsequent medical career==
When the youngest of her three children was old enough, she returned part-time to her medical career, initially working as the medical officer at Crawford’s biscuit factory in Edinburgh and later as a [[general practitioner]] in a practice on [[Leith Walk]], Edinburgh.&lt;ref name = "BMJ obit" /&gt; In 1967 she was appointed medical officer for geriatrics at [[Queensberry House|Queensberry House and Lodge]] in the [[Canongate]], Edinburgh, where she was known for her kindness, sensitivity, and compassion, and was also acknowledged as an extremely capable clinician.&lt;ref name ="Scotsman"/&gt; She was appointed geriatric associate specialist at the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Edinburgh|Royal Victoria]], [[Corstorphine Hospital|Corstorphine]], and Eastern General hospitals.

In 1975 she was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE)]] for services to geriatrics.&lt;ref name = "BMJ obit"/&gt; When St Columba’s Hospice for palliative care opened in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stcolumbashospice.org.uk/|title=St Columba's Hospice|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barron worked on a voluntary basis, covering weekends and many nights, subsequently as a member of the executive committee until 1993. In addition she worked as a volunteer [[Couples therapy|marriage guidance]] councillor, and volunteered in the Leith Hospital Samaritan Society. She was chair of the local [[Medical Women's Federation|Medical Women’s Federation]] and in her retirement chair of the Cruse bereavement counselling service.&lt;ref name ="Scotsman"/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
She met a fellow surgeon Arthur F M Barron while they worked together as anatomy demonstrators. They married in [[Carlisle Cathedral]] in July 1950. He became consultant surgeon to [[Leith Hospital]]. He died suddenly in 1971 following a [[stroke]].

Barron underwent successful open [[Valve replacement|heart valve replacement]] surgery at the age of 92. She died in Edinburgh on 10 October 2014.&lt;ref name = "BMJ obit"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1615">A '''quad helix''' (or quadhelix) is an [[orthodontic]] appliance for the upper [[human teeth|teeth]] that is cemented in the [[human mouth|mouth]]. It is attached to the [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s by 2 bands and has two or four active [[helix]] [[spring (device)|springs]] that widen the arch of the mouth to make room for crowded teeth, or correct a posterior cross-bite, where lower teeth are buccal (outer) than upper teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Laura|title=An Introduction to Orthodontics|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198568124}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually made from 38 mil stainless steel wire and is primarily indicated in mixed dentition, cleft patients and those that have performed the act of thumbsucking. A variety of this appliance is inserted into attachments that are welded to the bands. In this way the orthodontist can adjust the appliance without removing the bands.

The precursor to the quad-helix was the [[coffin spring]]. Similar devices known as tri-helices and bi-helices were later developed, with three and two helix springs, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurkeerat|title=Textbook of Orthodontics|edition=2nd|date=December 31, 2007|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Publishers|location=[[New Delhi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expander works by gently pushing the teeth outwards to eventually widen the upper arch. A quad helix expander is usually given to those who have a narrow top jaw, a cross bite and/or crowded teeth.

'''Red wine headache ("RWH")''' is a [[headache]] often accompanied by [[nausea]] and [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] that occurs after consuming  [[red wine]] in susceptible individuals.  [[White wine]] headaches have been less-commonly reported.

== Sulfites ==
Many wines contain a warning label about [[sulfites]], and some people believe that sulfites are the cause of RWH and other allergic and pseudoallergic reactions. However, this may not be the case.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 34"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 34 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dried fruit]] and processed foods like lunch meat have more sulfites than red wine.  Reactions to sulfites are not considered a "true allergy" and reactions more commonly occur in persons with [[asthma]] and may manifest themselves in difficulty breathing or skin reactions, rather than headache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sulphites - One of the ten priority food allergens|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/pubs/securit/2012-allergen_sulphites-sulfites/index-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some wines may be exempt from including a sulfite warning. Wines that have under 10mg/l of sulfites do not need to be labeled that they contain sulfites. This includes added and natural sulfites, like sulfites that come from the soil, or those produced by yeasts during alcoholic fermentation. Wines labeled "100% Organic", "Organic", "Made With Organic Grapes", "Made With Organic and Non-Organic Grapes" or without organic certification may contain sulfites, and must disclose this on the label. This also means that the so called "Natural" wine can also contain sulfites. Different rules might apply in different continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Labeling Wine with Organic References|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5077433|publisher=US Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Marketing Service|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Histamine ==

{{main|Histamine intolerance}}

[[Histamine]] is present in a variety of fermented products such as wine, aged [[cheese]]s, and [[sauerkraut]]. Red wine has 20–200% more histamine than white wine, and those who react to it may be deficient in the enzyme [[diamine oxidase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maintz|first=Laura|author2=Novak, N |title=Histamine and histamine intolerance|journal=American Society for Clinical Nutrition|date=May 2007|volume=85|issue=5|pages=1185–1196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts believe that in some individuals, alcohol consumption may lead to elevated plasma histamine levels even in the absence of histamines in the beverage consumed. A study of 16 people with an intolerance to red wine found no difference in reactions to low and high histamine wines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanny|first=Gisele|title=No correlation between wine intolerance and histamine content of wine|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=February 2001|volume=107|issue=2|pages=375–378|doi=10.1067/mai.2001.112122|pmid=11174207|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other biogenic amines may also have an effect. Taking an antihistamine an hour before drinking may reduce the reaction to histamine and the resulting symptoms{{Citation needed|reason=Uncited medical advice|date=November 2017}}.

== Prostaglandins ==

RWH could be caused by the release of [[prostaglandins]] which some people are not able to metabolize.  Prostaglandins are substances that can contribute to pain and swelling. [[Ibuprofen]], [[paracetamol]] and aspirin are prostaglandin inhibitors. Aspirin and ibuprofen were shown to be effective at blocking both early and late stages of the RWH, and paracetamol was effective in blocking the early stage. However, paracetamol and NSAIDs like ibuprofen must not be taken with alcohol as the combination can cause liver damage.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman and D. Starr, Prevention of the Red Wine Headache (RWH); A Blind Controlled Study. In New Advances in Headache Research, 2nd edition, ed. F. Clifford Rose. Smith-Gordon, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32415">Although it is toxic in large doses, '''[[selenium]]''' is an essential [[micronutrient]] for animals. In plants, it sometimes occurs in toxic amounts as [[forage]], e.g. [[locoweed]]. Selenium is a component of the [[amino acid]]s [[selenocysteine]] and [[selenomethionine]]. In humans, selenium is a [[dietary mineral|trace element]] nutrient that functions as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] for [[glutathione peroxidase]]s and certain forms of [[thioredoxin reductase]].&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Lippard, J. M. Berg "Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry" University Science Books: Mill Valley, CA; 1994.  {{ISBN|0-935702-73-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Selenium-containing proteins are produced from inorganic selenium via the intermediacy of [[Selenophosphate synthetase 1|selenophosphate]] (PSeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Se-containing biomolecules==

Selenium is an essential [[micronutrient]] in mammals, but is also recognized as toxic in excess. Selenium exerts its biological functions through [[selenoprotein]]s, which contain the [[amino acid]] [[selenocysteine]]. Twenty-five selenoproteins are encoded in the [[human genome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glutathione peroxidase===
The [[glutathione peroxidase]] family of enzymes (abbreviated GSH-Px) catalyze reduction of [[hydrogen peroxide]] and organic [[hydroperoxide]]s:

:2H + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   GSSG  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The two H atoms are donated by thiols in a process that begins with oxidation of a [[selenol]] side chain in GSH-Px.  The [[organoselenium compound]] [[ebselen]] is a drug used to supplement the action of GSH-Px.  It functions as a catalyst for the destruction of hydrogen peroxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bhabak Krishna P., Mugesh Govindasamy | year = 2010 | title = Functional Mimics of Glutathione Peroxidase: Bioinspired Synthetic Antioxidants | url = | journal = Acc. Chem. Res. | volume = 43 | issue = 11| pages = 1408–1419 | doi = 10.1021/ar100059g | pmid = 20690615 | last2 = Mugesh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related selenium-containing enzyme in some plants and in animals ([[thioredoxin reductase]]) generates reduced thioredoxin, a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme [[ribonucleotide reductase]] that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.&lt;ref name="Stadtman"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stadtman TC |title=Selenocysteine |journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry |volume=65 |issue= |pages=83–100 |year=1996 |pmid=8811175 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.65.070196.000503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deiodinases===
Selenium also plays a role in the functioning of the [[thyroid]] gland.  It participates as a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] for the three [[thyroid hormone]] [[deiodinase]]s.  These enzymes activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/selenium/ |publisher = Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University |title = Selenium |accessdate = 2009-01-05|date = 2014-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may inhibit [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis|Hashimotos's disease]], an auto-immune disease in which the body's own thyroid cells are attacked by the immune system. A reduction of 21% on TPO antibodies was reported with the dietary intake of 0.2&amp;nbsp;mg of selenium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17696828 |title = Effects of 12 months treatment with L-selenomethionine on serum anti-TPO Levels in Patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis |year=2007 |last1=Mazokopakis |first1=EE |last2=Papadakis |first2=JA |last3=Papadomanolaki |first3=MG |last4=Batistakis |first4=AG |last5=Giannakopoulos |first5=TG |last6=Protopapadakis |first6=EE |last7=Ganotakis |first7=ES |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=609–12 |doi=10.1089/thy.2007.0040 |journal=Thyroid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formate dehydrogenase===
Some microorganisms ulitize selenium in [[formate dehydrogenase]]. Formate is produced in large amounts in the hepatic (liver cells) mitochondria of embryonic cells and in cancer cells by the folate cycle.&lt;ref&gt;H Frederik Nijhout, et al, In silico experimentation with a model of hepatic mitochondrial folate metabolism, Theoretical Biology and Medical Modeling, 2006, 3:40, link http://www.tbiomed.com/content/3/1/40/abstract).&lt;/ref&gt;

Formate is reversibly oxidized by the enzyme [[formate dehydrogenase]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reda T., Plugge C. M., Abram N. J., Hirst J. | year = 2008 | title = Reversible interconversion of carbon dioxide and formate by an electroactive enzyme | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 105 | issue = 31| pages = 10654–10658 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0801290105 | pmid = 18667702 | last2 = Plugge | last3 = Abram | last4 = Hirst | pmc = 2491486 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..10510654R }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:HCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  →   CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Thioredoxin reductase ===
[[Thioredoxin reductase]] uses a cysteine-selenocysteine pair to reduce the [[disulphide]] in [[thioredoxin]]. The selenocysteine  is arranged in an unusual Sec-His-Glu [[catalytic triad]], which tunes its pKa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Wolfgang|last2=Wessjohann|first2=Ludger A.|date=2005-02-04|title=The Functional Role of Selenocysteine (Sec) in the Catalysis Mechanism of Large Thioredoxin Reductases: Proposition of a Swapping Catalytic Triad Including a Sec-His-Glu State|journal=ChemBioChem|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=386–394|doi=10.1002/cbic.200400276|pmid=15651042|issn=1439-7633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indicator plants==
Certain species of plants are considered indicators of high selenium content of the soil, since they require high levels of selenium to thrive. The main selenium indicator plants are ''[[Astragalus]]'' species (including some [[locoweed]]s), prince's plume (''[[Stanleya (plant)|Stanleya]]'' sp.), woody asters (''[[Xylorhiza]]'' sp.), and false goldenweed (''[[Oonopsis]]'' sp.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/54282000/PPClassPPSlides/3-27-08DavisSelenium.pdf |title = Selenium in Plants |accessdate = 2008-12-05 |author= Zane Davis, T. |year = 2008 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical use of synthetic selenium compounds==
The substance loosely called [[selenium disulfide|selenium sulfide]] (with the approximate formula SeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the active ingredient in some anti-dandruff shampoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://pharmacycode.com/Selenium(IV)_sulfide.html |title =Selenium(IV)_sulfide |publisher = Pharmacy Codes |accessdate = 2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The selenium compound kills the scalp fungus ''[[Malassezia]]'', which causes shedding of dry skin fragments. The ingredient is also used in body lotions to treat [[Tinea versicolor]] due to infection by a different species of ''Malassezia'' fungus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://dermnetnz.org/treatments/selenium.html |title = Selenium sulfide |publisher = DermNet NZ |accessdate = 2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection in biological fluids==
Selenium may be measured in blood, plasma, serum or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or to assist in a forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates (selenosugars) in the body prior to being eliminated in the urine. Cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1416–1420.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity==
Although selenium is an essential [[dietary mineral|trace element]], it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the [[Dietary Reference Intake|Tolerable Upper Intake Level]] of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/selenium.asp#h7 |title = Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Selenium |publisher = National Institutes of Health; Office of Dietary Supplements |accessdate = 2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 400 microgram ([[Microgram|µg]]) Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Selenium, and Carotenoids |publisher = Institute of Medicine |date = August 15, 2000 |pages = 314–315 |url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9810&amp;page=315 |isbn = 978-0-309-06949-6 |author = a report of the Panel on Dietary Antioxidants and Related Compounds, Subcommittees on Upper Reference Leves of Nutrients and of Interpretation and Use of Dietary Reference Intakes, and the Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes, Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to not only avoid [[toxicity]], but also to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to account for data from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;

Symptoms of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can result in [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, [[pulmonary edema]], and death.&lt;ref name="tp92-c3"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp92-c3.pdf |format = PDF |publisher = Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |title = Public Health Statement: Health Effects |accessdate = 2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elemental selenium and most metallic [[selenide]]s have relatively low toxicities because of their low [[bioavailability]]. By contrast, [[selenate]]s and [[Selenite (ion)|selenites]] are very toxic, having an oxidant mode of action similar to that of arsenic trioxide. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Wilber |first = C.

[[Selenium Pollution|Selenium poisoning]] of water systems may result whenever new agricultural runoff courses through normally dry, undeveloped lands. This process leaches natural soluble selenium compounds (such as selenates) into the water, which may then be concentrated in new "wetlands" as the water evaporates. High selenium levels produced in this fashion have been found to have caused certain congenital disorders in wetland birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qN0I3husm50C&amp;pg=PA477 |chapter = Ecotoxicology of selenium |title = Handbook of ecotoxicology |first = H.

In fish and other wildlife, low levels of selenium cause deficiency while high levels cause toxicity.  For example, in salmon, the optimal concentration of selenium in the fish tissue (whole body) is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of tissue (dry weight).  At levels much below that concentration, young salmon die from selenium deficiency;&lt;ref name= Poston. &gt;{{cite journal | last= Poston | first= H. A. |author2= Combs, G.

==Deficiency==
{{main article|Selenium deficiency}}
Selenium deficiency can occur in patients with severely compromised [[intestine|intestinal]] function, those undergoing [[total parenteral nutrition]], and&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/71/2/590 |title = Effect of micronutrient status on natural killer cell immune function in healthy free-living subjects aged &gt;=90 y1 |author = Ravaglia et al. |volume = 71 |issue = 2 |pages = 590–598 |journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |pmid = 10648276 |date=1 February 2000 |last2 = Forti |first2 = P |last3 = Maioli |first3 = F |last4 = Bastagli |first4 = L |last5 = Facchini |first5 = A |last6 = Mariani |first6 = E |last7 = Savarino |first7 = L |last8 = Sassi |first8 = S |last9 = Cucinotta |first9 = D|last10 = Lenaz |first10 = G |display-authors = 8 |doi = 10.1093/ajcn/71.2.590 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in those of advanced age (over 90). Also, people dependent on food grown from selenium-deficient soil are at risk. Although [[New Zealand]] has low levels of selenium in its soil, adverse health effects have not been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/PUarticles/Sel.htm |work = Prescriber Update Articles |title = Selenium |accessdate = 2009-07-13 |publisher = New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority |author = MedSafe Editorial Team }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selenium deficiency as defined by low (&lt;60% of normal) selenoenzyme activity levels in brain and endocrine tissues only occurs when a low selenium status is linked with an additional stress, such as high exposures to mercury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ralston|first=N.V.C.|author2=Raymond, L.J. |title=Dietary selenium's protective effects against methylmercury toxicity|journal=Toxicology|year=2010|volume=278|issue=1|pages=112–123|doi=10.1016/j.tox.2010.06.004|pmid=20561558}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a result of increased oxidant stress due to vitamin E deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title =Essentials of Human Nutrition |edition = 2nd |publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-0-19-262756-8 |first1 = Jim |last1 = Mann |first2 = A. Stewart |last2 = Truswell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selenium interacts other nutrients, such as [[iodide]] and [[vitamin E]]. The interaction is observed in the [[etiology]] of many deficiency diseases in animals and pure selenium deficiency is rare. The effect of selenium deficiency on health remains uncertain, particularly in relation to [[Kashin-Beck disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/78/1/137?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=selenium&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT |title = Selenium and iodine supplementation of rural Tibetan children affected by Kashin-Beck osteoarthropathy |first1 = Rodrigo |last1 =Moreno-Reyes |first2 = Jean |last2 =Mathieu| first3 = Marleen |last3 =Vanderpas| first4 = Françoise |last4 = Begaux| first5 = Carl |last5 =Suetens| first6 = Maria T. |last6 =Rivera| first7 = Jean |last7 =Nève| first8 = Noémi |last8 =Perlmutter |journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume = 78 |issue = 1 |pages = 137–144 |year = 2003 |author9=V |pmid=12816783 |doi = 10.1093/ajcn/78.1.137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary recommendations==
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for selenium in 2000. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated [[Adequate Intake]] (AI) is used instead. The current EAR for selenium for people ages 14 and up is 45 μg/day. The RDA is 55 μg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 60 μg/day. RDA for lactation is 70 μg/day. For children ages 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 20 to 40 μg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of selenium the UL is 400 μg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRIs).&lt;ref name="DRItext"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = [[Institute of Medicine]] | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Selenium, and Carotenoids | chapter = Selenium | publisher = The National Academies Press | year = 2000 | location = Washington, DC | pages = 284–324 | url = https://www.nap.edu/read/9810/chapter/9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women and men ages 15 and older the AI is set at 70 μg/day. AI for pregnancy is 70 μg/day, for lactation 85 μg/day. For children ages 1–14 years the AIs increase with age from 15 to 55 μg/day. These AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 300 μg/day, which is lower than the U.S. value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For selenium labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 70 μg, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 55 μg.&lt;ref name="FedReg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf |title=Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels. FR page 33982.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at [[Reference Daily Intake]].

In the United States, selenium deficiency is not common. A federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19, average consumption from foods and beverages was 89 and 125 μg/day, respectively. For women and men of all ages fewer than 3% consumed less than the EAR.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/80400530/pdf/0102/usualintaketables2001-02.pdf/ What We Eat In America, NHANES 2001–2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106010550/https://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/80400530/pdf/0102/usualintaketables2001-02.pdf |date=2015-01-06 }}. Table A15: Selenium.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food sources==
Dietary selenium comes from nuts, [[cereals]], [[meat]], [[mushrooms]], [[fish]], and [[egg (food)|egg]]s. [[Brazil nut]]s are the richest ordinary dietary source and could cause selenium toxicity if consumed regularly – though the actual concentration of selenium (as with any plant-based food sources, such as another selenium-accumulating "paradise nut" [[Lecythis]], belonging to the same family [[Lecythidaceae]]) is soil-dependent and may vary significantly by geographic location. In descending order of concentration, high levels are also found in [[kidney]], [[tuna]], [[crab]], and [[lobster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Barclay |first = Margaret N. I. |author2=Allan MacPherson |author3=James Dixon  |year = 1995 |title=Selenium content of a range of UK food |journal=Journal of Food Composition and Analysis |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages = 307–318 |doi = 10.1006/jfca.1995.1025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A list of selenium-rich foods can be found on [http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/selenium.asp#h2 The Office of Dietary Supplements Selenium Fact Sheet].{{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human body's content of selenium is believed to be in the 13–20 milligram range.&lt;ref&gt;The most popular web reference for this is [http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=6424964].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human health==

===Cancer===
"Although an inverse association between selenium exposure and the risk of some types of cancer was found in some observational studies, this cannot be taken as evidence of a causal relation, and these results should be interpreted with caution... Conflicting results including inverse, null and direct associations have been reported for some cancer types... RCTs assessing the effects of selenium supplementation on cancer risk have yielded inconsistent results... To date, no convincing evidence suggests that selenium supplements can prevent cancer in humans."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vinceti|first=Marco|last2=Filippini|first2=Tommaso|last3=Del Giovane|first3=Cinzia|last4=Dennert|first4=Gabriele|last5=Zwahlen|first5=Marcel|last6=Brinkman|first6=Maree|last7=Zeegers|first7=Maurice Pa|last8=Horneber|first8=Markus|last9=D'Amico|first9=Roberto|date=January 29, 2018|title=Selenium for preventing cancer|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=1|pages=CD005195|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005195.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=29376219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
AIDS appears to involve a slow and progressive decline in levels of selenium in the body. Whether this decline in selenium levels is a direct result of the replication of HIV or related more generally to the overall malabsorption of nutrients by AIDS patients remains debated. Observational studies have found an association between decreased selenium levels and poorer outcomes in patients with HIV, though these studies were mostly done prior to the currently effective treatments with highly active antiretroviral therapy ([[HAART]]).  Currently there is inadequate evidence to recommend routine selenium supplementation for HIV patients, and further research is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stone CA, Kawai K, Kupka R, Fawzi WW |title=Role of selenium in HIV infection |journal=Nutr.

Selenium supplementation has no effect on overall mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid =22419320|year =2012|last1 =Bjelakovic|first1 =G|last2 =Nikolova|first2 =D|last3 =Gluud|first3 =LL|last4 =Simonetti|first4 =RG|last5 =Gluud|first5 =C|title =Antioxidant supplements for prevention of mortality in healthy participants and patients with various diseases|volume =3|issue =3|pages =CD007176|doi =10.1002/14651858.CD007176.pub2|journal =Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|editor1-last =Bjelakovic|editor1-first =Goran|url =http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1516-31802015000200164|type =Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tuberculosis===
As with other types of supplementation, there is no good evidence selenium supplementation helps in the treatment of tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grobler L, Nagpal S, Sudarsanam TD, Sinclair D |title=Nutritional supplements for people being treated for active tuberculosis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=6 |pages=CD006086 |year=2016 |pmid=27355911 |pmc=4981643 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006086.pub4 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diabetes===

A meta-analysis of four RCTs concluded that there is no support for selenium supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Caucasians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mao S, Zhang A, Huang S |title=Selenium supplementation and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=Endocrine |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=758–63 |year=2014 |pmid=24858736 |doi=10.1007/s12020-014-0298-7 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human reproductive system===
Abnormally high or low levels of dietary selenium can have an adverse effect on sperm quality, with a consequent lowering of fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ahsan U, Kamran Z, Raza I, etal |title=Role of selenium in male reproduction - a review |journal=[[Anim.

==Evolution in biology and biosynthetic considerations==

Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as selenocysteine,&lt;ref name="glady"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gladyshev VN, Hatfield DL |title=Selenocysteine-containing proteins in mammals |journal=Journal of Biomedical Science |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=151–60 |year=1999 |pmid=10343164 |doi=10.1007/BF02255899|url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/biochemgladyshev/77 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells seem to have a bacterial [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, sea urchin, fish and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in utilization of the small reducing molecules [[glutathione]] and [[thioredoxin]].

Trace elements involved in GSH-Px and superoxide dismutase enzymes activities, i.e. selenium, [[vanadium]], [[magnesium]], [[copper]], and [[zinc]], may have been lacking in some terrestrial mineral-deficient areas.&lt;ref name="glady" /&gt; Marine organisms retained and sometimes expanded their seleno-proteomes, whereas the seleno-proteomes of some terrestrial organisms were reduced or completely lost. These findings suggest that aquatic life supports selenium utilization, whereas terrestrial habitats lead to reduced use of this trace element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lobanov AV, Fomenko DE, Zhang Y, Sengupta A, Hatfield DL, Gladyshev VN |title=Evolutionary dynamics of eukaryotic selenoproteomes: large selenoproteomes may associate with aquatic life and small with terrestrial life |journal=Genome Biology |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=R198 |year=2007 |pmid=17880704 |pmc=2375036 |doi=10.1186/gb-2007-8-9-r198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The selenium content of SEPP1 versus selenium requirements in vertebrates|url = https://peerj.com/articles/1244|journal = PeerJ|pmc = 4699779|pmid = 26734501|volume = 3|pages = e1244|doi = 10.7717/peerj.1244|first = Sam|last = Penglase|first2 = Kristin|last2 = Hamre|first3 = Ståle|last3 = Ellingsen|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine fishes and vertebrate thyroid glands have the highest concentration of selenium and iodine. From about 500 Mya, freshwater and terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of "new" endogenous antioxidants such as [[ascorbic acid]] (Vitamin C), [[polyphenol]]s (including flavonoids), [[tocopherol]]s, etc. A few of these appeared more recently, in the last 50–200 million years, in fruits and flowers of angiosperm plants. In fact, the angiosperms (the dominant type of plant today) and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the late [[Jurassic]] period.

About 200 Mya, new selenoproteins were developed as mammalian GSH-Px enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Castellano S, Novoselov SV, Kryukov GV, etal |title=Reconsidering the evolution of eukaryotic selenoproteins: a novel nonmammalian family with scattered phylogenetic distribution |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=71–7 |year=2004 |pmid=14710190 |pmc=1298953 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kryukov GV, Gladyshev VN |title=The prokaryotic selenoproteome |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=538–43 |year=2004 |pmid=15105824 |pmc=1299047 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilting R, Schorling S, Persson BC, Böck A |title=Selenoprotein synthesis in archaea: identification of an mRNA element of Methanococcus jannaschii probably directing selenocysteine insertion |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=266 |issue=4 |pages=637–41 |year=1997 |pmid=9102456 |doi=10.1006/jmbi.1996.0812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang Y, Fomenko DE, Gladyshev VN |title=The microbial selenoproteome of the Sargasso Sea |journal=Genome Biology |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=R37 |year=2005 |pmid=15833124 |pmc=1088965 |doi=10.1186/gb-2005-6-4-r37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yamaguchi was born in 1930 to a poor family in [[Nagasaki]]. In 1945, he was employed as an under-age weapons maker. On August 9, 1945, he suffered [[keloid]] scars while working at the weapon factory when the United States dropped a nuclear bomb, which destroyed nearly everything in Nagasaki.

Yamaguchi has only served in two [[anti-nuclear organizations]], one being the Anti-nuclear arms movement in 1955 and heading the [[Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations]] between the years of 1981 and 2010. He even once was granted permission to be involved in the 1982 [[United Nations]] meeting. In his last years, he was hospitalized and died of an illness on July 6, 2013 in [[Unzen, Nagasaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atomic bomb survivor who became anti-war activist dies at 82|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/people/AJ201307070022|publisher=The Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''septic tank''' is an underground chamber made of concrete, fiberglass or plastic through which domestic wastewater ([[sewage]]) flows for [[Sewage treatment|basic treatment]].&lt;ref name="tilley2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title=Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies|last2=Ulrich|first2=Lukas|last3=Lüthi|first3=Christoph|last4=Reymond|first4=Philippe|last5=Zurbrügg|first5=Chris|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag)|year=|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|edition=2nd|location=Duebendorf, Switzerland|pages=|chapter=Septic tanks|chapter-url=http://ecompendium.sswm.info/sanitation-technologies/septic-tank?group_code=s|last1=Tilley|first1=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Settling and [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] processes reduce solids and organics, but the treatment efficiency is only moderate (referred to as "primary treatment").&lt;ref name="tilley2" /&gt; Septic tank systems are a type of simple [[onsite sewage facility]] (OSSF). They can be used in areas that are not connected to a [[sewerage]] system, such as rural areas. The treated liquid effluent is commonly disposed in a [[septic drain field]] which provides further treatment. However, [[groundwater pollution]] may occur and can be a problem.

The term "septic" refers to the [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic bacterial]] environment that develops in the tank which decomposes or mineralizes the waste discharged into the tank. Septic tanks can be coupled with other [[Onsite sewage facility|onsite wastewater treatment]] units such as [[biofilter]]s or aerobic systems involving artificially forced [[aeration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The rate of accumulation of sludge—also called [[septage]] or [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]]—is faster than the rate of decomposition.&lt;ref name="tilley2" /&gt; Therefore, the accumulated fecal sludge must be periodically removed which is commonly done with a [[vacuum truck]].&lt;ref name=nesc&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a septic system?

==Description==
[[File:Septic tank in Lesotho (underground) (2937019185).jpg|thumb|Septic tank in Lesotho (underground), concrete cover slab is visible]]
[[File:Landpeople s cc8.PNG|thumb|right|Septic tank and [[septic drain field]]]]

A septic tank consists of one or more concrete or plastic tanks of between 4000 and 7500 liters (1,000 and 2,000 gallons); one end is connected to an inlet [[wastewater]] pipe and the other to a [[septic drain field]]. Generally these pipe connections are made with a T pipe, allowing liquid to enter and exit without disturbing any crust on the surface. Today, the design of the tank usually incorporates two chambers, each equipped with a manhole cover, and separated by a dividing wall with openings located about midway between the floor and roof of the tank.

Wastewater enters the first chamber of the tank, allowing solids to settle and scum to float. The settled solids are anaerobically digested, reducing the volume of solids. The liquid component flows through the dividing wall into the second chamber, where further settlement takes place. The excess liquid, now in a relatively clear condition, then drains from the outlet into the [[septic drain field]], also referred to as a leach field, drain field or seepage field, depending upon locality. A [[percolation test]] is required prior to installation to ensure the porosity of the soil is adequate to serve as a drain field.&lt;ref&gt;Section H2 Building Regulations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gustafson|first1=David|last2=Machmeier|first2=Roger E.|title=How to run a percolation test|url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/environment/housing-technology/moisture-management/how-to-run-a-percolation-test/index.html|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining impurities are trapped and eliminated in the [[soil]], with the excess water eliminated through [[percolation]] into the soil, through [[evaporation]], and by uptake through the [[root]] system of [[plant]]s and eventual [[transpiration]] or entering [[groundwater]] or [[surface water]]. A piping network, often laid in a stone-filled trench (see [[weeping tile]]), distributes the wastewater throughout the field with multiple drainage holes in the network.  The size of the drain field is proportional to the volume of wastewater and inversely proportional to the porosity of the drainage field. The entire septic system can operate by gravity alone or, where topographic considerations require, with inclusion of a lift [[pump]].  Certain septic tank designs include [[siphon]]s or other devices to increase the volume and velocity of outflow to the drainage field.  These help to fill the drainage pipe more evenly and extend the drainage field life by preventing premature clogging or [[bioclogging]].

An [[Imhoff tank]] is a two-stage septic system where the sludge is digested in a separate tank.  This avoids mixing digested sludge with incoming sewage. Also, some septic tank designs have a second stage where the [[effluent]] from the anaerobic first stage is aerated before it drains into the seepage field.

A properly designed and normally operating septic system is odor-free and, besides periodic inspection and emptying of the septic tank, should last for decades with minimal maintenance.

A well designed and maintained concrete, fiberglass, or plastic tank should last about 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cecalaveras.ucdavis.edu/realp.htm |title=Septic Tanks: The Real Poop |publisher=University of California Extension |accessdate=28 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303040517/http://cecalaveras.ucdavis.edu/realp.htm |archive-date=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emptying ==
[[File:Emptying of a tank full with sewage by vacuum truck (2921521126).jpg|thumb|A vacuum truck used to empty septic tanks in Germany]]
{{Further|Fecal sludge management}}
Waste that is not decomposed by the anaerobic digestion must eventually be removed from the septic tank. Otherwise the septic tank fills up and wastewater containing undecomposed material discharges directly to the drainage field.  Not only is this detrimental for the environment but, if the sludge overflows the septic tank into the leach field, it may clog the leach field piping or decrease the soil porosity itself, requiring expensive repairs.

When a septic tank is emptied, the accumulated sludge ([[septage]], also known as [[fecal sludge]]&lt;ref name=Arbogast2013&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/water/why-fecal-sludge-management-serious-business |title=Why Fecal Sludge Management is Serious Business |last=Arbogast |first=Brian |date=November 18, 2013 |work=The Water Blog, [[The World Bank]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is pumped out of the tank by a [[vacuum truck]]. How often the septic tank must be emptied depends on the volume of the tank relative to the input of solids, the amount of indigestible solids, and the ambient temperature (because anaerobic digestion occurs more efficiently at higher temperatures), as well as usage, system characteristics and the requirements of the relevant authority. Some health authorities require tanks to be emptied at prescribed intervals, while others leave it up to the decision of an inspector. Some systems require pumping every few years or sooner, while others may be able to go 10–20 years between pumpings. An older system with an undersize tank that is being used by a large family will require much more frequent pumping than a new system used by only a few people. Anaerobic decomposition is rapidly restarted when the tank is refilled.

Services for de-sludging tend to empty a septic tank completely, i.e. take out all septage, while the actual requirement is removal of settled solids, it's left purposefully incomplete so as to leave at least some of the microbial populations in place to continue the anaerobic degradation processes that take place in a septic tank.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} An empty tank may be damaged by hydrostatic pressure causing the tank to partially "float" out of the ground, especially in flood situations or very wet ground conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Septic Systems - What to Do after the Flood |url=https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/septic-systems-what-do-after-flood |website=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance==
[[File:Septic tank not in ground.jpg|thumb|right|A septic tank before installation, with manhole cover on top]]
[[File:Septic tank.jpg|thumb|right|The same tank partially installed in the ground]]

Like any system, a septic system requires maintenance. The maintenance of a septic system is often the responsibility of the resident or property owner. Some forms of abuse or neglect include the following:

=== User's actions ===
* Excessive disposal of cooking oils and grease can cause the inlet drains to block. Oils and grease are often difficult to degrade and can cause odor problems and difficulties with the periodic emptying.
* Flushing non-biodegradable waste items down the toilet such as [[Cigarette#Cigarette butt|cigarette butts]], [[cotton swab|cotton buds/swabs]] or [[Menstruation#Menstrual products|menstrual hygiene products]] and [[condom]]s can cause a septic tank to clog and fill rapidly, so these materials should not be disposed of in that manner. The same applies when the toilet is connected to a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] rather than a septic tank. 
* Using the toilet for disposal of food waste can cause a rapid overload of the system with solids and contribute to failure.&lt;ref name="homeowner2"&gt;{{cite web |title=What can make my system fail? |url=http://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/homeowner_guide_long_customize.pdf |website=United States Environmental Protection Agency |publisher=EPA |accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Certain chemicals may damage the components of a septic tank or kill the bacteria needed in the septic tank for the system to operate properly, such as [[pesticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s, materials with high concentrations of [[bleach]] or [[sodium hydroxide|caustic soda]] (lye),{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} or any other inorganic materials such as paints or solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Mark|title=Septic Tanks – The Guide|url=https://septicleanse.com/septic-tanks/|publisher=Septicleanse|accessdate=18 July 2016|date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using [[Water softening|water softeners]] - the brine discharge from water softeners may harm the bacteria responsible for breaking down the wastewater. Usually the brine is however sufficiently diluted with other wastewater that it does not adversely affect the septic system.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hockingcountyhealthdepartment.com/pdf/water-softener-fact-sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other factors ===
* Roots from trees and shrubbery protruding above the tank or drainfield may clog and/or rupture them. Trees that are directly within the vicinity of a concrete septic tank have the potential to penetrate the tank as the system ages and the concrete begins to develop cracks and small leaks. Tree roots can cause serious flow problems due to plugging and blockage of drain pipes, added to which the trees themselves tend to expand extremely vigorously due to the ready supply of nutrients from the septic system.
* Playgrounds and storage buildings may cause damage to a tank and the drainage field. In addition, covering the drainage field with an impermeable surface, such as a driveway or parking area, will seriously affect its efficiency and possibly damage the tank and absorption system.
* Excessive water entering the system may overload it and cause it to fail.
* Very high rainfall, rapid [[snowmelt]], and [[flood]]ing from rivers or the sea can all prevent a drain field from operating, and can cause flow to back up, interfering with the normal operation of the tank. High winter [[water table]]s can also result in [[groundwater]] flowing back into the septic tank.
* Over time, [[biofilm]]s develop on the pipes of the drainage field, which can lead to blockage. Such a failure can be referred to as "biomat failure".

=== Septic tank additives ===
{{Further|Pit additives}}
Septic tank additives have been promoted by some manufacturers with the aim to improve the effluent quality from septic tanks, reduce sludge build-up and to reduce odors. However, these additives—which are commonly based on "[[effective microorganisms]]"—are usually costly in the longer term and fail to live up to expectations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Foxon, K., Still, D. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2162 Do pit additives work?] Water Research Commission (WRC), University of Kwazulu-Natal, Partners in Development (PiD), South Africa&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that in the U.S. more than 1,200 septic system additives were available on the market in 2011.&lt;ref name="Pradhan" /&gt; However, very little peer-reviewed and replicated field research exists regarding the efficacy of these biological septic tank additives.&lt;ref name="Pradhan"&gt;S. Pradhan, Michael T. Hoover, G.H. Clark, M. Gumpertz, C. Cobb, J. Strock (2011) [http://www.soil.ncsu.edu/publications/septic/JEH12.11_Feature_Impacts_of_Biological_Additives_Part_2.pdf Impacts of biological additives; Part 2 Septic Tank Effluent Quality and Overall Additive Efficacy], Journal of Environmental Health, Volume 74, Number 5, p. 22-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental concerns==
While a properly maintained and located septic tank does not pose any more environmental problems than centralized municipal sewage treatment{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}, certain problems can arise with septic tanks in unsuitable locations. Since septic systems require large [[Septic drain field|drainfields]], they are not suitable for densely built areas.

=== Odor and gas emissions ===
Some constituents of wastewater, especially [[sulfate]]s, under the anaerobic conditions of septic tanks, are reduced to [[hydrogen sulfide]], a [[odor|pungent]] and [[toxic]] gas. [[Methane]] may also be released. [[Nitrate]]s and [[Nitro compound|organic nitrogen compounds]] can be reduced to [[ammonia]]. Because of the anaerobic conditions, [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] processes take place, which may generate [[carbon dioxide]] and/or [[methane]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

=== Nutrients in the effluent ===
Septic tanks by themselves are ineffective at removing [[nitrogen]] compounds that have potential to cause [[algal blooms]] in waterways into which affected water from a septic system finds its way. This can be remedied by using a nitrogen-reducing technology,&lt;ref name="Vcenter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/etv/pubs/600s07004.pdf |title=Residential nutrient reduction |accessdate=2010-12-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602060154/http://www.epa.gov/etv/pubs/600s07004.pdf |archivedate=June 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by simply ensuring that the leach field is properly sited to prevent direct entry of effluent into bodies of water.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The fermentation processes cause the contents of a septic tank to be anaerobic with a low [[redox]] potential, which keeps [[phosphates]] in a soluble and, thus, mobilized form. Phosphates discharged from a septic tank into the environment can trigger prolific plant growth including algal blooms, which can also include blooms of potentially toxic [[cyanobacteria]].

The soil's capacity to retain phosphorus is usually large enough to handle the load through a normal residential septic tank. An exception occurs when [[septic drain field]]s are located in sandy or coarser soils on property adjoining a water body. Because of limited particle surface area, these soils can become saturated with phosphates. Phosphates will progress beyond the treatment area, posing a threat of [[eutrophication]] to surface waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cru.cahe.wsu.edu/CEPublications/eb1475/eb1475.html | author = Craig G. Cogger | publisher = College of Agriculture and Home Economics, Pullman, Washington | title = eb1475 Septic System Waste Treatment in Soil | accessdate = 2006-07-11 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060823033140/http://cru.cahe.wsu.edu/CEPublications/eb1475/eb1475.html | archivedate = 2006-08-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Groundwater pollution ===
In areas with high population density, [[groundwater pollution]] beyond acceptable limits may occur. Some small towns are experiencing the costs of building very expensive centralized wastewater treatment systems because of this problem, owing to the high cost of extended collection systems. To reduce residential development which might increase the demand to construct an expensive centralized sewerage system, building moratoriums and limits on the [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] of property are often imposed. Ensuring existing septic tanks are functioning properly can also be helpful for a limited time, but becomes less effective as a primary remediation strategy as population density increases.

=== Surface water pollution ===
In areas adjacent to water bodies with fish or [[shellfish]] intended for human consumption, improperly maintained and failing septic systems contribute to pollution levels that can force harvest restrictions and/or commercial or recreational harvest closures.

== Use ==
In the [[United States]], the 2007 American Housing Survey indicated that about 20 percent of all households rely on septic tanks, &lt;ref name="AHS2007"&gt;{{cite web |title=American Housing Survey for the United States: 2007 |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/h150-07.pdf |website=American Housing Survey |publisher=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development |accessdate=2018-08-08 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the overwhelming majority of systems are located in [[rural]] (50%) and [[suburb]]an (47%) areas.&lt;ref name="AHS2007" |page=17,28,39/&gt; [[Indianapolis]] is one example of a large city where many of the city's neighborhoods still rely on separate septic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensenergygroup.com/STEP|title=Septic Tank Elimination Program|publisher=Citizens Energy Group|accessdate=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, septic systems are generally limited to rural areas.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Regulations==
{{Over-coverage|section|region=the European Union|date=January 2017}}

=== European Union ===
In the [[European Union]] the [[EN 12566]] standard provides the general requirements for packaged and site assembled treatment plants used for domestic wastewater treatment.

Part 1 ([[EN 12566-1]]) is for septic tanks which are prefabricated or factory manufactured and made of [[polyethylene]], [[glass reinforced polyester]], [[polypropylene]], [[UPVC|PVC-U]], [[steel]] or [[concrete]]. Part 4 ([[EN 12566-4]]) regulates septic tanks that are assembled in situ from prefabricated kits, generally of concrete construction. Certified septic tanks of both types must pass a standardized hydraulic test to assess their ability to retain suspended solids within the system. Additionally, their structural adequacy in relevant ground conditions is assessed in terms of water-tightness, treatment efficiency, and structural behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Santala, E. [http://www.earthforever.org/pics/p14Finnish_regulations_European_standards.pdf ''Finnish regulations, European standards and testing of small wastewater treatment plants'']. Finnish Environment Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France ====

In [[France]], about 4 million households (or 20% of the population) are using on-site wastewater disposal systems (''l’assainissement non collectif''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assainissement-non-collectif.developpement-durable.gouv.fr MEDDE (Ministère de l'Écologie, du Développement durable et de l'Énergie), Portail d'informations sur l'assainissement non collectif]&lt;/ref&gt; including septic tanks (''fosse septique''). The legal framework for regulating the construction and maintenance of septic systems was introduced in 1992 and updated in 2009 and 2012 with the intent to establish the technical requirements applicable to individual sewerage systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=87BFC4F3E89500EDF54382AC22342262.tpdila21v_2?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000025743299&amp;dateTexte=20150527|title=Arrêté du 7 mars 2012 modifiant l'arrêté du 7 septembre 2009 fixant les prescriptions techniques applicables aux installations d'assainissement non collectif recevant une charge brute de pollution organique inférieure ou égale à 1,2 kg/j de DBO5 - Legifrance|author=|date=|work=legifrance.gouv.fr|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Septic tanks in France are subject to inspection by SPANC (''Service Public d’Assainissement Non Collectif''), a professional body appointed by the respective local authorities to enforce wastewater collection laws, at least once in four years. Following the introduction of EN 12566, the discharge of effluent directly into ditches or watercourses is prohibited, unless the effluent meets prescribed standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegoodlifefrance.com/fosse-septique-france-rules-and-requirements/|title=Fosse Septique France|author=|date=|work=The Good Life France|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ireland ====

According to the [[Census of Ireland 2011]], 27.5% of Irish households (i.e. about 440,000 households), with the majority in rural areas, use an individual septic tank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cso.ie/en/census/census2011reports/census2011profile4theroofoverourheads-housinginireland/ CSO, 2012, Census 2011 Profile 4 The Roof over our Heads - Housing in Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a [[European Court of Justice]] judgment made against [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in 2009 that deemed the country non-compliant with the [[Waste Framework Directive]] in relation to domestic wastewaters disposed of in the countryside, the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 was passed in order to regulate wastewater discharges from domestic sources that are not connected to the public sewer network and to provide arrangements for registration and inspection of existing individual domestic wastewater treatment systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environ.ie/en/Legislation/Environment/Water/FileDownLoad,29427,en.pdf Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012], Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&amp;num=C-188/08 Case C-188/08], Judgment of the Court (Second Chamber) of 29 October 2009. Commission of the European Communities v Ireland. Failure of a Member State to fulfil obligations - Directive 75/442/EEC - Waste - Domestic waste waters discharged through septic tanks in the countryside - Waste not covered by other legislation - Failure to transpose.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a code of practice has been developed by the [[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)|Environmental Protection Agency]] to regulate the planning and construction of new septic tanks, secondary treatment systems, septic drain fields and filter systems.&lt;ref name="EPA_CodeOfPractice"&gt;[http://www.epa.ie/downloads/advice/water/wastewater/code%20of%20practice%20for%20single%20houses/#d.en.27967 Code of Practice: Wastewater Treatment Systems for Single Houses], 2010. Environmental Protection Agency, Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt; Direct discharge of septic tank effluent into groundwater is prohibited in Ireland, while the indirect discharge via unsaturated subsoil into groundwater, e.g. by means of a septic drain field, or the direct discharge into surface water is permissible in accordance with a Water Pollution Act license.&lt;ref name="EPA_CodeOfPractice" /&gt; Registered septic tanks must be desludged by an authorized contractor at least once a year; the removed fecal sludge is disposed of, either to a managed municipal wastewater treatment facility or to agriculture provided that nutrient management regulations are met.&lt;ref name="EPA_CodeOfPractice" /&gt;

Since 2015, only certain property owners in [[England]] and [[Wales]] with septic tanks or small packaged sewage treatment systems need to register their systems, and either apply for a permit or qualify for an exemption with the [[Environment Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Standard Note SN06059 (2014). [http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06059/SN06059.pdf Septic tanks: new regulations], House of Commons Library&lt;/ref&gt; Permits need to be granted to systems that discharge more than a certain volume of effluent in a given time or that discharge effluent directly into sensitive areas (e.g., some groundwater protection zones).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/permits-you-need-for-septic-tanks/permits|title=Septic tanks and treatment plants: permits and general binding rules|author=|date=|work=www.gov.uk|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, permits are not granted for new septic tanks that discharge directly into surface waters.

In [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Department of the Environment (Northern Ireland)|Department of the Environment]] must give permission for all wastewater discharges where it is proposed that the discharge will go to a waterway or soil infiltration system. The discharge consent will outline conditions relating to the quality and quantity of the discharge in order to ensure the receiving waterway or the underground aquifer can absorb the discharge.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Environment (Northern Ireland) [http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/water-home/regulation_of_discharges_industrial/septictanks.htm Septic Tanks and Domestic Discharges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613041745/http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/water-home/regulation_of_discharges_industrial/septictanks.htm |date=2015-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Water Environment Regulations 2011 regulate the registration of septic tank systems in [[Scotland]]. Proof of registration is required when new properties are being developed or existing properties change ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) [http://www.sepa.org.uk/media/34761/car_a_practical_guide.pdf The Water Environment (Controlled Activities) Regulations 2011: A practical guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
In Australia, septic tank design and installation requirements are regulated by State Governments, through Departments of Health and Environmental Protection Agencies. Regulation may include Codes of Practice&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/ba6ead0048f0d8ab828287f25a3eb7d6/2013SAHealth_On-site_Wastewater_Systems_Code_April.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CACHEID=ba6ead0048f0d8ab828287f25a3eb7d6&amp;CACHE=NONE|title=On-site Wastewater Systems Code|last=|first=|date=April 2013|website=SA Health|publisher=SA Health, Government of South Australia|access-date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.vic.gov.au/~/media/Publications/891%204.pdf|title=Code of practice - onsite wastewater management|last=|first=|date=July 2016|website=|publisher=EPA Victoria|access-date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/statutes/regs.nsf/3b7e5f26432801b348256ec3002c128c/40d2c1afd926a7b448256704000fdd55/$FILE/Health%20(Treatment%20of%20Sewage%20and%20Disposal%20of%20Effluent%20and%20Liquid%20Waste)%20Regulations%201974.PDF|title=Health (Treatment of Sewage and Disposal of Effluent and Liquid Waste) Regulations 1974|last=|first=|date=7 October 2005|website=|publisher=Government of Western Australia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulatory requirements for the design and installation of septic tanks commonly references Australian Standards (1547 and 1546). Capacity requirements for septic tanks may be outlined within Codes of Practice, and can vary between states.

In many council districts (e.g. Sunshine Coast) septic systems have been banned and need to be replaced with much more expensive small scale [[sewage treatment]] systems that actively pump air into the tank producing an aerobic environment.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Septic systems need to be replaced with any new building applications, regardless of how well the old system performed.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== United States ===
According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]], in the United States it is the home owners' responsibility to maintain their septic systems.&lt;ref name="homeowner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/homeowner_guide_long_customize.pdf|title=A Homeowner's Guide to Septic Systems|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|publisher=EPA|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone who disregards this requirement will eventually be faced with costly repairs when solids escape the tank and clog the clarified liquid effluent disposal system.

In [[Washington (state)|Washington]], for example, a "shellfish protection district" or "clean water district" is a geographic service area designated by a county to protect water quality and tideland resources. The district provides a mechanism to generate local funds for water quality services to control non-point sources of pollution, such as septic system maintenance. The district also serves as an educational resource, calling attention to the pollution sources that threaten shellfish growing waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psparchives.com/publications/our_work/misc/Fact_sheets/shellfish_protection_dist_05.pdf|title=Shellfish - Marine|date=|author=Beatrice|work=Marine|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Southern bread riots''' were events of [[civil disorder|civil unrest]] in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]], perpetrated mostly by women in March and April 1863. During these riots, which occurred in cities throughout the South, women and men violently invaded and looted various shops and stores.&lt;ref&gt;Michael B. Chesson, "Harlots or Heroines? A New Look at the Richmond Bread Riot." ''Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' 92#2 (1984): 131-175. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4248710 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

The riots were triggered by the women's lack of money, provisions, and food.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Elizabeth Massey,  "The food and drink shortage on the Confederate homefront." ''North Carolina Historical Review'' 26.3 (1949): 306-334. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23515975 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; All were the result of multiple factors:
* Inflation had caused prices to soar while incomes had not kept pace.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene M. Lerner, "Money, prices, and wages in the Confederacy, 1861-65." ''Journal of Political Economy'' (1955): 20-40. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1826773 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Refugees had flooded the cities causing severe shortages of housing and overwhelming the old food supply system. Richmond's population tripled from 38,000 people in 1860 to over 100,000 by 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Elizabeth Massey, ''Refugee Life in the Confederacy'' (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Hoyt Bill, ''The Beleaguered City: Richmond, 1861-1865'' (1946) p 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* Food supplies in rural areas were running short and less food was exported to cities; foraging armies, both Union and Confederate, ravaged crops and killed farm animals.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew F. Smith, ''Starving the South: How the North Won the Civil War'' (Macmillan, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many cities—especially Richmond—were at the end of long supply lines, and internal transportation became increasingly difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Black, ''The railroads of the Confederacy'' (1952).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The drought of 1862 resulted in a poor harvest in a time when food was already scarce.
* Salt, which at the time was the only practical meat preservative, was very expensive (if available at all) because it was generally an imported item. The [[Union blockade]] prevented imports, and the capture of [[Avery Island]], Louisiana, with its salt-mine, exacerbated the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kurlansky, ''Salt: A World History''&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the [[French Revolution]], citizens, mostly women, began to protest the exorbitant price of bread. The protesters believed a negligent government and speculators were to blame. To show their displeasure, many protesters turned to violence. In [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]; [[Columbus, Georgia]], [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], [[Atlanta]], and [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] armed mobs attacked stores and warehouses. In [[North Carolina]], mobs destroyed grocery and [[dry goods]] stores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.lib.unc.edu/ncc/ref/nchistory/mar2005/ The Salisbury Bread Riot]&lt;/ref&gt;

Food riots were occurring before the arrival of Union troops because the Confederate army was suffering the same food shortages and was taking food stocks for its own needs. Additionally, as the cost of war for the Confederate government exceeded the tax revenue, [[Confederate war finance|legislation was enacted]] that exacerbated the situation by devaluing the Confederate currency and inflating prices of goods.{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}

==Richmond bread riots==

On April 2, 1863, in the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]], about 5,000 people, mostly poor women, broke into shops and began seizing food, clothing, shoes, and even jewelry before the Militia arrived to restore order. Tens of thousands of dollars worth of items were stolen. No one died and few were injured.&lt;ref&gt;Chesson, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; The riot was organized and instigated by [[Mary Jackson (Richmond Bread Riot)|Mary Jackson]], a huckster and the mother of a soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/hungry-history/bread-or-blood-the-richmond-bread-riots|title=Bread or Blood: The Richmond Bread Riot - Hungry History|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=April 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Jefferson Davis]] pleaded with the women and even threw them money from his pockets, asking them to disperse, saying "You say you are hungry and have no money; here, this is all I have". The mayor read the [[Riot Act]]; the governor called out the militia, and it restored order.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine R. Titus, "The Richmond Bread Riot of 1863: Class, Race, and Gender in the Urban Confederacy" ''The Gettysburg College Journal of the Civil War Era'' 2#6 (2011)  pp 86-146&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], a '''spirangle''' is a figure related to a [[spiral]].  Spirangles are similar to spirals in that they expand from a center point as they grow larger, but they are made out of straight [[line segment]]s, instead of curves. Spirangle [[vectograph]]s are used in vision therapy to promote [[stereopsis]] and help resolve problems with [[hand–eye coordination]].

==Two-dimensional spirangles==
A two-dimensional spirangle is an open figure consisting of a line bent into angles similar to a corresponding [[polygon]].  The spirangle can start at a center point, or a distance from the center, and has some number of turns around the center point.

==Three-dimensional spirangles==
Three-dimensional spirangles have layers that slant upward, progressively gaining height from the previous segment.  This is similar to staircases in large buildings that turn at the top of each flight.  The segments also may progressively lose an amount of length and resemble a pyramid.

==Uses==

[[Ophthalmology]] – vectograms

[[Electronics]] – printed [[inductor]]s

[[Architecture]] – ‘spiral’ [[staircase]]s

[[Jewelry]] – earrings, pendants

'''St. Elizabeths Hospital''' opened in 1855 as the first [[Federal government of the United States|federally operated]] [[psychiatric hospital]] in the United States. Housing over 8,000 patients at its peak in the 1950s, the hospital at one point had a fully functioning medical–surgical unit, a school of [[nursing]], and accredited [[Internship (medicine)|internships]] and [[Psychiatrist|psychiatric]] [[Residency (medicine)|residencies]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/22/AR2010042204136.html | work=The Washington Post | title=D.C. celebrates building opening at St. Elizabeths | first=Henri E. | last=Cauvin | date=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its campus was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;

St. Elizabeths is in southeast [[Washington, D.C.]] Since 2010, hospital functions have been limited to a portion of the east campus operated by the [[District of Columbia]] Department of Mental Health. The remainder of the east campus is slated for redevelopment by the District of Columbia, which owns the site. The west campus is owned by the federal government and is being redeveloped for use as headquarters for the U.S. [[Department of Homeland Security]] and its child agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Markon|first=Jerry |date=May 20, 2014 |title= Planned Homeland Security headquarters, long delayed and over budget, now in doubt.

==History==

===Early years and peak operations===
[[File:Center building at Saint Elizabeths, National Photo Company, circa 1909-1932.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Center Building at St. Elizabeths, one of the oldest on the campus, as it appeared in the early 20th Century]]
The hospital was created in August 1852 when the [[United States Congress]] appropriated $100,000 for the construction of a mental hospital in Washington, D.C.; to provide care for indigent, mentally ill residents of the District of Columbia, as well as for the insane of the [[U.S. Army]] and [[U.S. Navy]]. As early as the 1830s, local residents including Dr. Thomas Miller, a local doctor and president of the D.C. Board of Health, had been petitioning Congress for a facility to care for the mentally ill in the [[City of Washington]]. Their efforts were given a significant boost when [[Dorothea Dix]] (1802–1877), a pioneering advocate for people living with mental illnesses, helped convince legislators of the need for the hospital. In 1852 she wrote the legislation that established the hospital.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=East of the river|last=Lowe|first=Gail|publisher=Anacostia Community Museum, Smithsonian Institution|year=2010|isbn=|location=Washington DC|pages=75|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dix, who was on friendly terms with President [[Millard Fillmore]], was asked to assist the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|secretary of the interior]] in getting the hospital started. Her first recommendation resulted in the appointment of Dr. Charles H. Nichols  as the hospital's first superintendent. After his appointment in the fall of 1852, Nichols and Dix began formulating a plan for the design and operation of the hospital as well as finding an appropriate location for it, based upon guidelines created by [[Thomas Story Kirkbride]].&lt;ref name="GSA May-2013"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dcpreservation.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/0-COMPLETE-St.-Elizabeths-Hospital-A-History.pdf |title=St. Elizabeths: A History |accessdate=2014-04-03 |author=Otto, Thomas |date=May 2013 |publisher=[[U.S. General Services Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1854 manual recommended specifics such as site, ventilation, number of patients, and the need for a rural location proximate to a city. He also recommended that the location have good soil for farming and gardens for the patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Maps of Saint Elizabeths Hospital, Washington D.C. - 1860.tif|thumb|right|200px|1860 Topographic Map of the Saint Elizabeths Hospital Campus]]
Dr. Nichols oversaw the design and building of St. Elizabeths, which began in 1853. It was built in three phases, the west wing first, then the east wing, and finally the center portion. The center portion was built to house all administrative operations as well as the superintendents' residential quarters. All three sections of the hospital were together under one roof, in keeping with Kirkbride's design. Two other buildings, the West Lodge (1856–98) for men and the East Lodge for women were built to house and care for African American patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Soon after the hospital opened to patients in January 1855, it became known officially as the '''Government Hospital for the Insane'''. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] the West Lodge, originally built for male African American patients, was used as a general hospital by the U.S. Navy. The unfinished east wing of the main building was used by the U.S. Army as a general hospital for sick and wounded soldiers. The Army hospital officially took the name of St. Elizabeths Army Medical Hospital to differentiate it from the mental hospital in the west wing of the same building. The name St. Elizabeths was derived from the [[Colonial America|colonial-era]] name for the tract of land on which the hospital was built.

After the Civil War and the closing of the Army's hospital, the St. Elizabeths name was used unofficially and intermittently until 1916, when Congress passed legislation changing the name from the Government Hospital for the Insane to '''St. Elizabeths Hospital''', inexplicably omitting the possessive apostrophe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also it transferred hospital to the [[United States Department of Interior]].

In the late 19th century the hospital temporarily housed animals that were brought back from expeditions for the [[Smithsonian Institution]], because of lack of housing for the animals at the yet-to-be-built [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]].&lt;ref name=SIA&gt;{{cite web|title=National Zoological Park, Records |url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_216681|work=Record Unit 74|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution Archives]]|accessdate=April 10, 2012|date=1887 1887-1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1940 St. Elizabeths Hospital was transferred to [[Federal Security Agency]], after abolition of Service hospital was transferred to [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]].&lt;ref name="Robert B. Matchette et al"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/418.html |title=Records of St. Elizabeths Hospital |accessdate=2017-07-27 |author=Robert B. Matchette et al. |date= |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, the St. Elizabeths campus housed 8,000 patients and employed 4,000 people.&lt;ref name="wapo-june-17-2007" /&gt; Beginning in the 1950s, however, large institutions such as St. Elizabeths were being criticized for hindering the treatment of patients. Community-based health care, as specified in the passage of the 1963 [[Community Mental Health Act]], led to [[deinstitutionalization]]. The act provided for local outpatient facilities and drug therapy as a more effective means of allowing patients to live near-normal lives. The first community-based center for mental health was established at St. Elizabeths in 1969.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The patient population of St. Elizabeths steadily declined.

By the 1960s and 1970s, the hospital was transferred to the [[National Institute of Mental Health]], the [[National Institutes of Health]] and the [[Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref name="Robert B. Matchette et al" /&gt;

===Later years===
[[Image:Main Building at Saint Elizabeths, Washington D.C., August 23, 2006.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The Main Building on the western campus at St. Elizabeths]]

By 1996 only 850 patients remained at the hospital, and years of neglect had become apparent; equipment and medicine shortages occurred frequently, and the heating system was broken for weeks at a time. By 2002 all remaining patients on the Federal western campus were transferred to other facilities.&lt;ref name="wapo-june-17-2007"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/16/AR2007061601192.html |title=Tussle Over St. Elizabeths |accessdate=2007-08-20 |author=Holley, Joe |date=June 17, 2007 |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |page=C01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it continues to operate, it does so on a far smaller scale than it once did. As of January 31, 2009, the current patient census was 404 in-patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=District of Columbia Dept. of Mental Health |date=December 31, 2008 |title=Trend Analysis |url=http://dmh.dc.gov/dmh/frames.asp?doc=/dmh/lib/dmh/pdf/sehmonthlytrendanalysisDecember2008.pdf |accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years approximately half of St. Elizabeths patients are [[Civil law (common law)|civilly]] committed to the hospital for treatment; the other half are forensic ([[Criminal law|criminal]]) patients.&lt;ref name=trend-analysis&gt;{{cite web|title=December 2008 – Trend Analysis – Hospital Statistics|url=http://dmh.dc.gov/dmh/frames.asp?doc=/dmh/lib/dmh/pdf/sehmonthlytrendanalysisDecember2008.pdf|publisher=DC Department of Mental Health|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forensic patients are those who are adjudicated to be criminally insane ([[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]]) or considered [[incompetent to stand trial]]. Civil patients are those who are admitted owing to an acute need for [[Psychiatry|psychiatric care]]. [[Civil law (common law)|Civil]] patients can be voluntarily or [[Involuntary commitment|involuntarily committed]] for treatment.

A new civil and forensic hospital was built on the East Campus by the District of Columbia Department of Mental Health and opened in the spring of 2010, housing approximately 297 patients. Until the new hospital opened, civil patients were cared for in various buildings on the East Campus; forensic patients were housed in the John Howard Pavilion. In the new facility, civil and forensic patients live in separate units of the same building. The new hospital also houses a library, an auditorium, multiple computer laboratories, and a small museum in the lobby.

In 2007 the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] and the [[District of Columbia]] reached a settlement over allegations that the [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] of patients housed at St. Elizabeths were violated by the District.&lt;ref&gt;See Settlement Agreement, available at [http://dmh.dc.gov/dmh/cwp/view,A,3,Q,639789.asp DMH.dc.gov], Retrieved on 2009-03-04.   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605031322/http://dmh.dc.gov/dmh/cwp/view%2CA%2C3%2CQ%2C639789.asp |date=June 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 28, 2014, the Department of Justice found that St. Elizabeths had "significantly improved the care and treatment of persons confined to Saint Elizabeths Hospital" and asked a federal court to dismiss the injunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-asks-court-dismiss-saint-elizabeths-hospital-case-after-conditions | title=Justice Department Asks Court to Dismiss Saint Elizabeths Hospital Case After Conditions Improved Under Consent Decree| date=2014-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2015, DC Auditors dismissed the settlement agreement and officially ended oversight of St. Elizabeths Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/2015/01/d-c-officially-ends-oversight-of-st-elizabeths.html#i1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revitalization plans for western campus===

After several decades in decline, it was decided that the large campus could no longer be adequately maintained. In 1987 hospital functions on the eastern campus were transferred from the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] to the District of Columbia government by St. Elizabeths Hospital and District of Columbia Mental Health Services Act of 1984,&lt;ref name="Congress.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/98th-congress/house-bill/6224 |title=H.R.6224 - Saint Elizabeths Hospital and District of Columbia Mental Health Services Act |accessdate=2017-07-27 |author= |date= 1984-11-08|publisher=''[[Congress.gov]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the federal government retaining ownership of the western campus.&lt;ref name="NIHhistoricsites" /&gt; Several commercial redevelopment opportunities were proposed by the D.C. government and consultants, including relocating the [[University of the District of Columbia]] to the campus or developing office and retail space. However, the tremendous cost of bringing the facilities up to code (estimated at $50–$100 million) kept developers away.&lt;ref name="wapo-june-17-2007" /&gt;

With little interest in developing the site privately, the [[Federal Government of the United States|federal government]] stepped in. Control of the western campus—home of the oldest building on the campus, the Center Building—was transferred to the [[General Services Administration]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="wapo-june-17-2007" /&gt; GSA improved security around the campus, shored up roofs, and covered the windows with plywood in an attempt to preserve the campus until a tenant could be found.

After three years of searching for an occupant, the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) announced on March 20, 2007, that it would spend approximately US$4.1 billion to move its headquarters and most of its Washington-based offices to a new {{convert|4500000|ft2|m2|adj=on}} facility on the site, beginning with the [[United States Coast Guard]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="fedtimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federaltimes.com/index.php?S=2626923 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130102171514/http://www.federaltimes.com/index.php?S=2626923 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |title=Homeland Security plans move to hospital compound |accessdate=2007-08-20 |author=Losey, Stephen |date=March 17, 2007 |publisher=''[[Federal Times]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; DHS, whose operations are scattered around dozens of buildings in the Washington, D.C., area, hopes to consolidate at least 60 of its facilities at St. Elizabeths and to save $64 million per year in rental costs. DHS also hopes to improve employee morale and unity by having a central location from which to operate.&lt;ref name="fedtimes"/&gt;
[[File:Skyline of Washington, seen from Saint Elizabeths, August 23, 2006.jpg|275px|thumb|right|The view of the Washington, D.C., skyline from St. Elizabeths]]
The plans to locate DHS to St. Elizabeths have been met with criticism, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moe|first=Richard|title=A Disaster for St. Elizabeths|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/07/AR2009010702977.html?nav=hcmoduletmv|accessdate=November 21, 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Historic preservation]]ists argue that the move will destroy dozens of historic buildings located on the campus and that other alternatives should be considered.&lt;ref name="wapo-june-17-2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nationaltrust"/&gt; Community activists have also expressed concern that the planned high-security facility will not interact with the surrounding community and do little to revitalize the economically depressed area.&lt;ref name="wapo-june-17-2007" /&gt; In 2007 the District of Columbia reached a deal with the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and agreed to fix widespread health and safety hazards in the hospital.&lt;ref name=cauvin&gt;{{cite news|last=Cauvin|first=Henri E.|title=U.S., D.C.

A ceremonial groundbreaking for the DHS consolidated headquarters took place at St. Elizabeths on September 11, 2009. The event was attended by Senator [[Joseph Lieberman]], DHS Secretary [[Janet Napolitano]], D.C. Delegate [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]], DC Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]], and acting GSA administrator Paul Prouty.&lt;ref name=press-release&gt;{{cite news|last=Press release|title=DHS and GSA Participate in Joint Groundbreaking Ceremony for Consolidated DHS Headquarters|url=https://www.dhs.gov/ynews/releases/pr_1252513779140.shtm|accessdate=January 23, 2012|newspaper=Homeland Security|date=September 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relocated [[Douglas A. Munro Coast Guard Headquarters Building|U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters Building]] was forecast to open in May 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtop.com/109/2840937/Wegmans-large-corporations-could-fill-vacant-DC-sites "Wegmans, large corporations could fill vacant D.C. sites"].

By 2015, construction began in Center Building. Initially, this building has been stated for renovation, but internal structures (floors and ceilings) appeared to be beyond repair. Whole Center Building was rehabilitated by removing old internal structures and building new structures in latter place, while retaining the historic facades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Historic Center Building Renovation - St. Elizabeths West Campus|url=http://www.grunley.com/market-sectors/commercial-office-education-campus-military-government/project-details/historic|accessdate=March 11, 2018|newspaper=|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patients==
Well-known patients of St. Elizabeths have included would-be presidential assassins [[Richard Lawrence (failed assassin)|Richard Lawrence]] (who attempted to kill [[Andrew Jackson]]) and [[John Hinckley Jr.]], who [[Reagan assassination attempt|shot Ronald Reagan]], as well as the assassin of [[James Garfield]], [[Charles J. Guiteau]] (until his execution). Other notable residents were [[Mary Fuller]], [[James Swann]], [[Ezra Pound]], and [[William Chester Minor]].&lt;ref name="wapo-june-17-2007" /&gt;

The poet Ezra Pound was kept in St. Elizabeths on the charge of treason for 13 years (1946–58). Despite his being sane, and proving it by publication of two volumes of poetry and several translations, he was deemed unfit to stand trial by reason of insanity. In 1958 the treason charges were dropped, but Dr. Overholser discharged him as "incurably insane."

According to Kelly Patricia O'Meara, St. Elizabeths is believed to have treated over 125,000 patients, though an exact number is not known because of poor record keeping.&lt;ref name="forgottendead"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_29_17/ai_77074788 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209180554/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_29_17/ai_77074788 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 9, 2008 |title=Forgotten Dead of St. Elizabeths |accessdate=2007-08-20 |author=O'Meara, Kelly Patricia |date=August 6, 2001 |work=[[Insight on the News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she believes that thousands of patients are buried in unmarked graves across the campus, although records for the individuals buried in the graves have been lost. She believes that the incinerator on site also brings up a few questions as to what may have happened to the bodies. The [[General Services Administration]], current owner of the property, considered using [[ground penetrating radar]] to attempt to locate unmarked graves but has yet to do so.

More than 15,000 known autopsies were performed at St. Elizabeths from 1884 through 1982, and a collection of over 1,400 brains preserved in [[formaldehyde]], 5,000 photographs of brains, and 100,000 slides of brain tissue was maintained by the hospital until the collection was transferred to a museum in 1986, according to O'Meara.&lt;ref name="forgottendead" /&gt; In addition to the mental health patients buried on the campus, several hundred [[American Civil War]] soldiers are interred at St. Elizabeths.

==Contributions to medicine==
[[File:St. Elizabeths Hospital, woman - Washington, D.C..jpg|thumb|left|An elderly patient at St. Elizabeths, ca. 1917]]
Several important therapeutic techniques were pioneered at St. Elizabeths, and it served as a model for later institutions.&lt;ref name="wapo-june-17-2007"/&gt; [[Walter Freeman (neurologist)|Walter Freeman]], onetime laboratory director, was inspired by St. Elizabeths to pioneer the transorbital [[lobotomy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/lobotomist/program/pt.html PBS.org]&lt;/ref&gt; During American involvement in World War II, the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS, predecessor to the [[CIA]]) used facilities and staff at St. Elizabeths hospital to test [[Truth drug|"truth serums"]]. OSS unsuccessfully tested a mescaline and scopolamine cocktail as a truth drug on two volunteers at St. Elizabeths Hospital. Separate tests of [[THC]] as a truth serum were equally unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/war/war_timeline.php#Note1 Erowid War Vault : Timeline&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1963 Dr. Luther D.

The campus of St. Elizabeths sits on bluffs overlooking the confluence of the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and [[Anacostia River]]s in the southeast quadrant of Washington, D.C. It is divided by Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue between the {{convert|118|acre|ha|adj=on}} east campus (owned by the D.C. government) and the {{convert|182|acre|ha|adj=on}} west campus (owned by the federal government).&lt;ref name="DCDeptHealth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmh.dc.gov/dmh/cwp/view,a,3,q,516064.asp |title=About St. Elizabeths Hospital |accessdate=2007-08-20 |author=District of Columbia Department of Mental Health |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823132840/http://dmh.dc.gov/dmh/cwp/view%2Ca%2C3%2Cq%2C516064.asp |archivedate=August 23, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has many important buildings, foremost among them the Center Building, designed according to the principles of the [[Kirkbride Plan]] by [[Thomas U. Walter]] (1804–87), who is better known as the primary architect of the expansion of the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]] that was begun in 1851.&lt;ref name="wapo-june-17-2007"/&gt;

Much of St. Elizabeths' campus has now fallen into disuse and is in serious disrepair. It was named in 2002 one of the nation's 11 Most Endangered Places by the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].&lt;ref name="nationaltrust"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preservationnation.org/issues/11-most-endangered/locations/st-elizabeths-hospital.html |title=List of America's most endangered historic places – St. Elizabeths |accessdate=2013-01-15 |author=National Trust for Historic Preservation |year=2002 |authorlink=National Trust for Historic Preservation }}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to many areas of the campus, including the abandoned western campus (which houses the Center Building), is restricted.&lt;ref name="NIHhistoricsites"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/medtour/elizabeths.html |title=Historic Medical Sites in the Washington, D.C.

==In popular culture==
*The hospital was referred to in an episode of the television series ''[[Bonanza]]''. The episode was "The Unseen Wound," featuring [[Leslie Nielsen]] as a sheriff, playing a former Civil War–era Army officer who falls victim to [[PTSD]], although the modern term was not used in the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0529851/ | title=The Unseen Wound}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the TV series ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]'' episode "Berserk," a PTSD victim was told by Nick Adams's character at the end of the show as he climbed aboard a stagecoach that he's "headed to a new hospital in Washington called St. Elizabeths."
*Portions of the west campus can be seen in the film ''[[A Few Good Men (film)|A Few Good Men]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0104257/locations|A Few Good Men (1992) – Filming Locations}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[National Public Radio]] interns toured the east and west campuses, then shared their experiences, in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/pictureshow/2010/05/03/126475263/stliz | title=New Life For Our Oldest Federal Psychiatric Facility | date=May 3, 2010 | accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*St. Elizabeths is referenced several times in W.E.B. Griffin's ''[[The Corps Series]]'' and ''[[Men at War (series)|Men at War]]'' as a place that the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) will confine people they consider a security risk for the duration of World War II.
*[[Abraham Lincoln]] mentioned St. Elizabeths to [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] in the novel ''Mrs. Lincoln's Dressmaker'' by Jennifer Chiaverini. It is shown to her because she cannot control her grief over the death of her son Willie.

'''Steve Romeo, Jr.''' (June 1, 1971 – March 7, 2012) was an [[United States|American]] [[ski mountaineer]] living in [[Jackson, Wyoming]].&lt;ref name="Teton Slide kills 2" &gt;{{cite web|last=Thuermer,|first=Angus|title=Teton Slide Kills 2 in Wyoming|url=http://www.summitdaily.com/article/20120312/NEWS/120319972|accessdate=4/12/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romeo was a prominent figure in the [[backcountry skiing|backcountry ski]] community of [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming|Jackson Hole, Wyo]]. He founded and ran the popular ski blog "Tetonat.com" which covered backcountry skiing throughout the [[Teton Range|Tetons]] as well as extensive gear reviews.&lt;ref name="Teton AT GOOD"&gt;{{cite web|last=Romeo|first=Steve|title=Randosteve, You Are Not Forgotten|url=http://www.tetonat.com/|accessdate=4/12/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romeo was killed on March 7, 2012 in a large slab avalanche on [[Ranger Peak (Wyoming)|Ranger Peak]] in the northern part of the Teton Range of Wyoming.&lt;ref name="Chose Their Fatefull PathGOOD"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thuermer|first=Angus|title=Park: Skiers Chose Their Fateful Path|url=http://jhnewsandguide.com/article.php?art_id=8373|accessdate=4/12/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some criticized Romeo's skiing as being somewhat reckless, yet most of the ski community saw Romeo as a preeminent American ski mountaineer who constantly pushed the boundaries of skiing in the Tetons.&lt;ref name="Chose Their Fatefull PathGOOD" /&gt; Others saw him as another self-promoting eastern transplant. Together with [[Cary Smith (ski mountaineer)|Cary Smith]], [[Pete Swenson]] and [[Chris Kroger]], he finished ninth in the relay event of the [[2006 World Championship of Ski Mountaineering]]. He was also known as "Randosteve", "Randomeo", "Randobewan Skinobee", "Skeve", "Ex-Steve", "Stevester", and "Stelvester Stallone".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tetonat.com/contact/ ''TetonAT.com''] by Steve Romeo.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Romeo was originally from [[Manchester, Connecticut]], and following graduation from [[Marist College]] in 1993, he moved to [[Jackson Hole, WY|Jackson Hole]] to work as a lift operator at [[Jackson Hole Mountain Resort]].&lt;ref name="Teton AT GOOD" /&gt; Romeo started the backcountry ski blog TetonAT.com in 2006. The site had a daily audience of over 10,000 visitors.&lt;ref name="Teton AT GOOD" /&gt;

The popularity of TetonAT, coupled with Romeo's relatively high profile within the ski community, led Romeo to eventually gain sponsorships with the following industry leaders: [[Black Diamond Equipment|Black Diamond]], [[Dynafit]], Arc'Teryx, Ortovox, GU, Nuun, and [[Mountain Khakis]]. Romeo skied across the globe, including notable stops throughout Europe, South America, New Zealand, Alaska, and Antarctica.&lt;ref name="Teton AT GOOD" /&gt;

== Death ==
On March 7, 2012, Steve Romeo and ski partner Chris Onufer left Colter Bay and crossed [[Jackson Lake]] over three miles of ice to the base of Ranger Peak in the northern Teton Range.&lt;ref name="Chose Their Fatefull PathGOOD" /&gt; Their tracks continued up the mountains toward Ranger Peak with their final intended destination probably being an unskied chute located in the [[Waterfalls Canyon]] area.&lt;ref name="Chose Their Fatefull PathGOOD" /&gt; It is impossible to know exactly what Romeo and Onufer's plans were for the day as they had not informed anyone of specific intended routes.&lt;ref name="Chose Their Fatefull PathGOOD" /&gt; "They chose to go up a known avalanche path ascending into an avalanche starting zone," noted Jenny Lake Park Ranger Rich Baerwald.&lt;ref name="Chose Their Fatefull PathGOOD" /&gt; Romeo and Onufer's skin tracks went up most of the mountain before disappearing in the avalanche slide path. This is likely where Romeo and Onufer triggered the avalanche, as search and rescue workers discovered the tell-tale signs of an avalanche trigger point as well as a three foot avalanche crown. Park rangers estimated that the avalanche gained speeds of up to 80 miles an hour.&lt;ref name="Chose Their Fatefull PathGOOD" /&gt; The avalanche debris could be seen from a distance of 14 miles,&lt;ref name="Teton Slide Kills 2 GOOD" /&gt; giving some measure of the size of the slide and its destructive power.

John Onufer, Chris's father, initially recognized that something was wrong when his son never showed up to meet him at the [[Jackson Hole Airport]] after flying in on the day of the avalanche.&lt;ref name="Teton Slide Kills 2 GOOD"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thuermer|first=Angus|title=Teton Slide Kills 2 in Wyoming|url=http://www.summitdaily.com/article/20120312/NEWS/120319972|accessdate=4/12/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Onufer contacted officials who quickly located the pair's car at [[Colter Bay Village|Colter Bay]].&lt;ref name="Teton Slide Kills 2 GOOD" /&gt; Romeo and Onufer's bodies were quickly located the day after the avalanche, as their bodies were not entirely buried in the avalanche debris that stretched for over a mile.&lt;ref name="Chose Their Fatefull PathGOOD" /&gt; The cause of death for both men was determined to be blunt force trauma by the Teton County Coroner.&lt;ref name="Chose Their Fatefull PathGOOD" /&gt;

Though the avalanche danger was listed as moderate on the day of the avalanche by the Bridger-Teton Avalanche center, the risk of a slide was increased by wind blowing loose snow onto leeward faces and loading certain aspects with additional snow, creating dangerous windslabs in certain areas.&lt;ref name="Chose Their Fatefull PathGOOD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Teton Slide Kills 2 GOOD" /&gt; The avalanche that killed Romeo and Onufer was on a slope that had been adversely affected by windblown snow.&lt;ref name="Chose Their Fatefull PathGOOD" /&gt;

Some within the Jackson Hole ski community wondered if various avalanche safety equipment devices, such as an 'avalanche airbag' could have saved the two from death in the avalanche, but park rangers stated that the avalanche was unsurvivable and that no equipment could have saved them.&lt;ref name="Chose Their Fatefull PathGOOD" /&gt; "One piece of equipment wasn't going to have any effect on injuries," noted Buffalo Fork Ranger Rick Guerrieri. "Their best tool they had with them, they weren't using the most. That was their brain."&lt;ref name="Chose Their Fatefull PathGOOD" /&gt; Although Romeo may have agreed with Guerrieri's statement, many members of the skiing community felt it was hurtful and in poor taste.  As one of Romeo's ski partners, Reed Finlay, reflected, "Even experts make mistakes. If you're a kid, it's a good lesson." &lt;ref&gt;Powder Magazine: Nature's Feedback, Why are so many of the best skiers dying? by Matt Hansen&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Romeo's website TetonAT.com posted a memorial entry to Romeo and Onufer following their deaths, but has remained otherwise silent.&lt;ref name="Teton AT GOOD" /&gt; The page continues to carry the sponsorship of many ski industry leaders.&lt;ref name="Teton AT GOOD" /&gt;

Romeo is survived by his parents, Elaine and Stephen Sr. Romeo, who live in Connecticut.&lt;ref name="Doyle good"&gt;{{cite web|last=Doyle|first=Paul|title=Parents of Mountaineer Killed in Avalanche Recall His Passion for Skiing|url=http://articles.courant.com/2012-03-29/sports/hc-steve-romeo-0329-20120328_1_ski-trips-bromley-mountain-stephen|accessdate=August 12, 2012|publisher=The Hartford Courant|date=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Steve, Elaine and Stephen Sr. went to Jackson Hole for a memorial, and they noted the amount of support from the community as a whole, pointing to Steve's impact in the area.&lt;ref name="Doyle good" /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Tadashi Kanehisa'''|金久 正|''Kanehisa Tadashi''|1906–1997}} was a Japanese folklorist and linguist who worked on the language and culture of his home island [[Kakeroma Island|Kakeroma]], and by extension, [[Amami Ōshima]] of southwestern [[Japan]]. As an informant of the Shodon dialect, he also worked with linguists [[Yukio Uemura]], [[Shirō Hattori]] and [[Samuel Martin (linguist)|Samuel E. Martin]].

==Biography==
Kanehisa was born to a wealthy family in Shodon, a village in southwestern Kakeroma Island of the [[Amami Islands]]. Unlike his half-brothers and sisters, he was grown up by his grandparents. His grandfather Minesato (嶺佐登) was an important source of his folkloristic studies in his later life.&lt;ref name="unasaka2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=Unasaka Noboru 海坂昇 | chapter=''Kanehisa Tadashi: 1937 nen no nikki o chūshin ni'' 金久正–一九三七年の日記を中心に |editor= Matsumoto Hirotake 松本泰丈 and Tabata Chiaki 田畑千秋 |title=''Amami fukki 50 nen'' 奄美復帰50年 |pages=335–339 |year=2004 |language=Japanese }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied English literature at [[Kyushu Imperial University]]. Being disappointed with it, he spent about five years pursuing folkloristic studies in his hometown Shodon. He then worked for the Nagasaki Prefectural Government while teaching linguistics at [[Kwassui Women's University|Kwassui Women's College]]. He published his folkloristic work at the ''Nantō'' (Southern Islands) edited by [[Eikichi Kazari]], and the ''Tabi to Densetsu'' (Travels and Legends). He won fame for his paper ''Amori Onagu'' (天降り女人) (1943), where he proposed a couple of novel theories on Amami's swan maiden motif, a conundrum originally posed by [[Shomu Nobori]]. His work was highly commended by [[Kunio Yanagita]], the father of Japanese folkloristics. His main source of information was a group of young men from Amami who had been drafted into the armament industry in Nagasaki. His informants were all killed by [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the U.S. atomic bombing on Nagasaki]] in 1945. He himself gradually lost his eyesight after the bombing.&lt;ref name="yamashita2011"&gt;Yamashita Kin'ichi 山下欣一 (2011). ''Kaisetsu'' 解説. In Kanehisa Tadashi. ''Amami ni ikiru Nihon kodai bunka'' 奄美に生きる日本古代文化 (Ancient Japanese Culture Still Alive in Amami). pages=493–506.&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, he returned to Shodon and soon moved to Naze (part of modern-day [[Amami, Kagoshima|Amami City]]), the center of Amami Ōshima. His blindness kept him from using his talent for prestigious jobs. He ran a private-tutoring school for the English language during daytime while continuing folkloristic and linguistic research at night. His decades of work resulted in the book titled ''Amami ni ikiru Nihon kodai bunka'' (Ancient Japanese Culture Still Alive in Amami). Its publication was done with the help from linguist [[Shirō Hattori]].&lt;ref name="kanehisa2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kanehisa Tadashi 金久正 | title=''Amami ni ikiru Nihon kodai bunka'' 奄美に生きる日本古代文化 (Ancient Japanese Culture Still Alive in Amami) |year=2011 |origyear=1963 |language=Japanese }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a linguist himself, he worked as an informant of the Shodon dialect, which is part of the [[Southern Amami Ōshima language|Southern Amami Ōshima dialect group]] of the [[Japonic languages]]. He worked with Yukio Uemura,&lt;ref name="karimata1995"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karimata Shigehisa 狩俣繁久  |title=''Kagoshima-ken Ōshima-gun Setouchi-cho Shodon hōgen no fonēmu'' 鹿児島県大島郡瀬戸内町諸鈍方言フォネーム (上) (The Phonemes of the Shodon dialect in Amami-Oshima (Part 1)) |journal=''Nihon Tōyō bunka ronshū'' 日本東洋文化論集 |number=1 |year=1995 |pages=1–23 |url=http://ir.lib.u-ryukyu.ac.jp/handle/123456789/2290 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shirō Hattori and Samuel Martin.&lt;ref name="martin1970"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Samuel E.

His primarily linguistic work include the ''Amami hōgen on'in no sandai tokushoku'' (Three features of the Amami dialect phonology) and the ''Amami ni ikiru kotengo'' (Literary language still alive in Amami). He spent his final years in [[Kagoshima, Kagoshima|Kagoshima]]. He died in 1997, leaving an uncompleted dictionary of the Amami dialect.&lt;ref name="yamashita2011" /&gt;

The filter design, which may include perforated holes, is one of the main differences between light and regular cigarettes. When attached to a smoking machine, the small holes in the sides of the filter [[wikt:dilute|dilute]] the [[tobacco]] smoke with clean air. In ultra-light cigarettes, the filter's perforations are even larger, and on the smoking machine, they produce an even smaller smoke-to-air ratio. However, smokers react to the reduced resistance by inhaling more deeply, and tend to cover the holes with their fingers and mouth. None of these ventilation techniques reduce [[health effects of tobacco|harm to smokers]], and some may increase it; they are designed to give better readings in a smoking-machine test while minimally reducing what human smokers inhale.&lt;ref name="10.1136" /&gt;

== History ==

=== Cigarette filter ===
The 1950s gave birth to numerous scientific studies that proved the link between cigarettes and cancer (see Wynder and Graham, 1950; Doll and Hill, 1952, 1954; Hammond and Horn, 1958).&lt;ref name="Risk"&gt;''Risk'' 2001, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these studies and their perceived threat to the tobacco industry's future profitability, tobacco companies experimented with new modifications to the cigarette design.&lt;ref name="Risk" /&gt; By altering the cigarette design, tobacco companies hoped to create a "safer" cigarette that would better appeal to their increasingly health-conscious consumers.&lt;ref name="Benson"&gt;Benson 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of filters was one of the industry's first design modifications, and filters would become essential to the later development of light and low-tar products.&lt;ref name="Orange Juice"&gt;NCI's Smoking 2007, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming that filtered cigarettes literally "filtered out" much of the harmful tar and carcinogenic particles found in regular cigarettes, tobacco companies promoted "relative product safety" in order to convince smokers to continue smoking.&lt;ref name="Benson" /&gt; Because filtered cigarettes were depicted as relatively safer and less harmful, smokers who were concerned about tobacco's negative health impacts were led to believe that by switching to filtered cigarettes, they would minimize smoking's detrimental impact on their health. As a result, millions of smokers switched to filtered cigarettes instead of quitting altogether.&lt;ref name="Benson" /&gt; By 1960, filtered cigarettes had become the leading tobacco product.&lt;ref name="Orange Juice" /&gt;

=== Creation of the "light" cigarette ===
In addition to promoting the filtered cigarette as the answer to smokers' health concerns, the tobacco industry also poured resources into developing a cigarette that would produce lower machine-measured tar and nicotine yields when tested by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).&lt;ref name="Risk" /&gt; This endeavor resulted in the introduction and heavy promotion of "light" cigarettes during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Orange Juice" /&gt; The newly designed light cigarette employed a special filter perforated with small holes; these perforated filters allegedly offset the concentration of inhaled harmful smoke with clean air. Most important to the tobacco industry, however, was that light cigarettes produced lower tar and nicotine levels when tested with the FTC's smoking machines.&lt;ref name="Risk" /&gt;

== Market share ==
By 1997, the advertising of light cigarettes constituted fifty percent of the tobacco industry's advertising spending.&lt;ref name="Orange Juice" /&gt;  Through heavy marketing, the tobacco industry succeeded in leading its consumer base to believe that light products were safer than regular brands, and thus, that these products were the rational choice for smokers who cared about their health.&lt;ref name="Benson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilpin 2002, p. S148&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these implicit and widespread health claims, the popularity of light and low-tar cigarettes grew considerably.  In fact, the market share of light cigarettes grew from 2.0 percent in 1967 to 83.5 percent of the tobacco market in 2005.&lt;ref name="Orange Juice" /&gt;

== Health claims ==

=== ISO machine-smoking method ===
Packages of light, mild, and low-tar cigarettes are often labeled as being "lower tar and nicotine" and also list tar and nicotine levels that are lower than those found on the packages of regular cigarettes. The lower tar and nicotine numbers found on cigarette packages represent the levels produced when machine "smoked" by a smoking machine test method.&lt;ref name="US NIH 2004"&gt;U.S. National Institute of Health, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] in 1967, the smoking machine test method was created to determine the yield of a cigarette by "smoking" it in a standardized fashion by machine; this test method is also known as the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) machine-smoking method.&lt;ref&gt;NCI's Smoking 2007, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; While the FTC has always recognized that the smoking machine cannot accurately replicate human smoking and that no two human smokers smoke in the same way, the FTC did not initially recognize the tobacco industry's ability to design cigarettes that yielded low levels of tar and nicotine when machine-smoked, but yielded much higher levels when smoked by a human being.&lt;ref name="Risk_b"&gt;''Risk'' 2001, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cigarette modifications and "compensatory" smoking ===
Light cigarettes essentially fool smoking machines through several techniques. A light cigarette's filter perforated by tiny holes, for instance, is uncovered when smoked by machine, and consequently, the cigarette smoke is heavily diluted with air and causes the machines to report low levels of nicotine and tar.&lt;ref name="US NIH 2004" /&gt; When smoked by human smokers, in contrast, this filter is usually covered by smokers' lips and fingers.&lt;ref name="US NIH 2004" /&gt; Consequently, the filter holes are closed and the light cigarette actually becomes equivalent to a regular cigarette.&lt;ref name="US NIH 2004" /&gt;  Some tobacco manufacturers also increased the length of the paper wrap which covers the cigarette filter; this modification serves to decrease the number of "puffs" available to the machine test and limits the amount of tobacco that is machine "smoked".&lt;ref name="US NIH 2004" /&gt; In reality, however, the tobacco found under this paper wrap which is not "smoked" by machine is still available to and smoked by the human smoker.&lt;ref name="US NIH 2004" /&gt;

The human act of "compensating" is perhaps the most important area in which the ISO machine-smoking method yields misleading results. Unlike machines, human smokers are often heavily addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes, and consequently, smokers alter their smoking behaviors in order to consume the amount of nicotine required to satisfy their cravings. Compensatory behavior most often occurs when a smoker switches from regular cigarettes to light cigarettes.&lt;ref name="US NIH 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benowitz"&gt;Benowitz 2005, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Risk_b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smoking_a"&gt;NCI's Smoking 2007, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous scientific studies reveal that the smoker compensates for the lower concentration of nicotine by actively changing his or her smoking habits.&lt;ref name="US NIH 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benowitz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Risk_b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smoking_a" /&gt; Smokers adjust their smoking techniques by smoking their cigarettes "more intensively".&lt;ref name="Benowitz" /&gt;  More intensive smoking is achieved by taking larger, more rapid, and more frequent puffs, by inhaling more deeply, by smoking more cigarettes per day, and/or by reflexively blocking the cigarette's filter.&lt;ref name="US NIH 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benowitz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Risk'' 2001, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these compensatory smoking behaviors, smokers of light cigarettes inhale significantly more nicotine and tar than what is measured by the ISO machine-smoking method.&lt;ref name="US NIH 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benowitz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Risk_a"&gt;''Risk'' 2001, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smoking_a" /&gt;

=== Scientific conclusions ===
According to the 2004 Surgeon General's report, "Smoking cigarettes with lower machine-measured yields of tar and nicotine provides no clear benefit to health."&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in NCI's Smoking 2007, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The tobacco industry's own internal documents also reveal that cigarette manufacturers are aware of the difference between machine-measured levels of nicotine and tar, and those actually inhaled by smokers.&lt;ref name="US NIH 2004" /&gt; The industry is also aware of the compensatory behaviors that smokers engage in when smoking light cigarettes.&lt;ref name="US NIH 2004" /&gt;

=== Research into low-nicotine cigarettes and effects on smoking frequency ===

A recent small-scale study led by nicotine researcher [[Neal Benowitz]] found that smokers who were switched to cigarettes with tobacco that contained progressively less nicotine did not compensate by smoking more cigarettes, although a significant minority of the smokers in the research withdrew from the study citing a dislike of the taste of the reduced-nicotine cigarettes. These results differ greatly from those obtained in earlier studies by Benowitz and others, where filter-based nicotine reduction was found to result in compensatory smoking behaviours. According to a USCF article on the study, Benowitz wanted to simulate a societal scenario in which the nicotine content of cigarettes would be progressively regulated downward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Norris |first1=Jeffrey |title=Cigarettes Made from Tobacco with Less Nicotine May Help Smokers Quit |url=https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2012/07/12242/cigarettes-made-tobacco-less-nicotine-may-help-smokers-quit |work=UC San Francisco |date=2002-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 ''Washington Post'' article, the US FDA has backed low-nicotine cigarette research as it weighs its new regulatory power. That new power includes the power to regulate the level of nicotine in cigarettes and was given to the FDA by the 2009 Tobacco Control Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dennis |first1=Brady |title=FDA backs low-nicotine cigarette research as it weighs new regulatory power |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/fda-tests-low-nicotine-cigarettes-as-it-weighs-new-regulatory-power/2013/07/30/122c0954-efbd-11e2-9008-61e94a7ea20d_story.html |accessdate=2018-02-01 |work=Washington Post |date=2013-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==

===USA===
In June 2009, the United States Senate passed anti-smoking legislation described by [[USA Today]] as "the most sweeping tobacco-control measure ever passed by Congress".&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt; This legislation directly impacted the marketing and consumption of light tobacco products.&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt;  In addition to giving the FDA regulatory power over all tobacco products, the bill severely restricted the tobacco industry's previous marketing strategies, many of which relied on making implicit health claims about their products.&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Duff"&gt;Duff 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to the bill, cigarette manufacturers are also forbidden from using product descriptors such as "light", "low-tar", and "mild".&lt;ref name="Duff" /&gt;

Critics of the legislation question whether it will have a significant impact on today's pervasive tobacco market in the United States.&lt;ref name="Benson" /&gt;  For one, the bill does not specify acceptable words for differentiating light cigarettes from other cigarettes.&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt;  Cigarette manufacturers quickly responded to this loophole by strategically color-coding their products so that [[Camel Lights]], for example, is now Camel Blue.  Nik Modi, a tobacco industry analyst, concedes that prohibiting terms like "light" and "low-tar" will hardly affect the tobacco market because smokers have already "become acclimated to color-coding."&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Koch 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The 2001 [[Directive on Tobacco Products]], which banned the use of terms such as "light", "mild" and "low-tar" with regards to tobacco products, was the first major piece of legislation from the [[European Commission]] regarding [[tobacco control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tobacco control in the EU |url=https://ec.europa.eu/health/archive/ph_information/documents/tobacco_control_en.pdf |publisher=[[European Commission]], [[European Union]] |accessdate=2018-10-01 |page=2 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came into effect on 30 September 2003 for members of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="RGTH et al"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borland |first1=R |last2=Fong |first2=G T |last3=Yong |first3=H-H |last4=Cummings |first4=K M |last5=Hammond |first5=D |last6=King |first6=B |last7=Siahpush |first7=M |last8=McNeill |first8=A |last9=Hastings |first9=G |last10=O'Connor |first10=R J |last11=Elton-Marshall |first11=T |last12=Zanna |first12=M P |title=What happened to smokers' beliefs about light cigarettes when "light/mild" brand descriptors were banned in the UK?

'''Zygmunt Zimowski''' (7 April 1949 – 13 July 2016) was a Polish [[prelate]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Archbishop Zimowski had served until his death in July 2016 as President of the [[Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers]], having been head of that office since his appointment by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] on 18 April 2009. He previously served as [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] of [[Radom]] from 2002 until 2009.

==Biography==
Zimowski was born in [[Kupienin]], Poland, located in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarnów]]. He was ordained a priest on 27 May 1973, and incardinated in Tarnów.&lt;ref name=archbishop&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bzimowski.html | title = Archbishop Zygmunt Zimowski | accessdate = 18 April 2009 | publisher = ''www.catholic-hierarchy.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a Licentiate in [[Dogmatic Theology]] from the [[Catholic University of Lublin]]. He continued his studies and subsequently received his Doctorate in Dogmatic Theology from the Faculty of Theology at the [[University of Innsbruck|Leopold-Franzens University of Innsbruck]]. On 1 February 1983 he entered the service of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], where he remained until elevated to the episcopate. He was appointed [[Monsignor|Chaplain of His Holiness]] on 14 April 1988 and [[Monsignor|Prelate of Honour]] on 10 July 1999.

He was Postulator of some processes of beatification and canonization. He taught ecclesiology at the Catholic University of Lublin and at the [[Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University]] in [[Warsaw]] and is the author of 120 publications, 40 pastoral letters and some books and several articles.

He participated in the preparation of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] and worked with the Polish section of [[Radio Vatican]].

On 28 March 2002, Zimowski was appointed Bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Radom]],&lt;ref name=archbishop/&gt; and was consecrated in the Cathedral of Radom on 25 May 2002 by the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]], later Pope Benedict XVI. In the Polish Bishops' Conference, he held the following positions: President of the Episcopal Commission for the Doctrine of the Faith, Member of the Permanent Council, Delegate for the Pastoral Care of Migrants Poles, Member of the Ecumenical Commission and the Group for Contacts with the Polish Ecumenical Council, Member of the group of Bishops for the Pastoral Care for Radio Maria, and Member of the [[Polish Society of Mariology]].

==Curia service==
He remained Bishop of Radom until his appointment as the President of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers in 2009. He was at the same time raised to the dignity of Archbishop ''ad personam''.&lt;ref name=archbishop/&gt; In addition to his native Polish, Archbishop Zimowski speaks Italian, German, English, French and Russian.

In January 2011 Archbishop Zimowski said that "Leprosy, in fact, after the upgrading of effective pharmacological therapies, witnessed a notable reduction of the lethal infection, but continues to cause suffering, diminution and social exclusion. Flourishing around it are ignorance, inequality and discrimination that, in turn, fuel its diffusion". He noted that from a statistical point of view, the countries that are most affected are in Asia, South America and Africa. India has the greatest number of affected people, followed by Brazil. Numerous cases are recorded also in Angola, Bangladesh, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nepal and Tanzania. He said that "Hansen's disease is an 'ancient' illness, but, because of this, no less devastating physically and also morally," Archbishop Zimowski reflected. "In all ages and civilizations, the fate of the leprosy sufferer is marginalization, being deprived of any type of social life, condemned to seeing his body disintegrate until death comes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-28201?l=english Vatican Official: Leprosy Still Needs Attention] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125122237/http://www.zenit.org/article-28201?l=english |date=25 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 May 2011, Pope Benedict appointed him a member of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]].

On 18 May 2011, in a speech to the annual assembly of the [[World Health Organization]] in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], he said that the world seemed "stalled in the status quo where the rich people have higher levels of coverage, while most of the poor people miss out, and [even] those who do have access often incur high, sometimes catastrophic costs in paying for services and medicine." He raised objections to needle-exchange programs and called for increased funding for poor nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wooden|first1=Cathy|title=Vatican calls for solidarity to guarantee access to health care|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1101962.htm|accessdate=26 November 2014|work=Catholic News Service|date=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 2012, [[World Autism Awareness Day]], Archbishop Zimowski said that "The Church needs to address the alienation often surrounding those living with autism, especially children and young people, by coming to the aid of those affected". He added: "The church sees as impelling the task of placing herself at the side of these people – children and young people in particular – and their families, if not to break down these barriers of silence then at least to share in solidarity and prayer in their journey of suffering".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/briefs/cns/20120402.htm#head10%5Bpermanent+dead+link%5D|title=Catholic News Service|website=www.catholicnews.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012 Archbishop Zimowski, as head of the Holy See delegation to the 65th World Health Assembly, reaffirmed the Holy See's support for Resolution WHA64.9 on "sustainable health financing structures and universal coverage," which urges member states to aim for affordable [[universal health care]] coverage and access for all citizens on the basis of equity and solidarity. Zimowski said "more countries, especially those with emerging economies, are moving towards universal coverage," thanks also to "good policies that promote equity. ... Therefore my delegation strongly believes that in the endeavor to promote universal coverage, fundamental values such as equity, human rights and social justice need to become explicit policy objectives". The archbishop made an appeal for high-income countries to show greater solidarity toward poorer nations in order to overcome funding shortfalls in health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ncronline.org/news/politics/vatican-committed-universal-health-care-coverage|title=Vatican committed to universal health care coverage|date=2012-05-24|work=National Catholic Reporter|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.com/2012/05/church-is-committed-to-universal.html|title=THE CHURCH IS COMMITTED TO UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE COVERAGE|last=02|first=Visarchive|date=2012-05-24|website=VIS news - Holy See Press Office|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July 2012, Archbishop Zimowski was named a Member of the [[Congregation for Bishops]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsofttranslator.com/BV.aspx?ref=IE8Activity&amp;a=http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/29522.php?index=29522&amp;lang=en|title=press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/29522.php?index=29522 - Translator|website=www.microsofttranslator.com|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimowski died in Poland on 13 July 2016, while convalescing following treatment for pancreatic cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | accessdate = 13 July 2016 | date = 13 July 2016 | url = https://www.ncronline.org/news/people/archbishop-zygmunt-zimowski-head-vatican-office-health-care-ministry-dies-67 | work = National Catholic Reporter | title = Archbishop Zygmunt Zimowski, head of Vatican office for health care ministry, dies at 67 | first = Carol | last = Glatz | agency = Catholic News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;
