==Events==
* 1826 – [[Nicéphore Niépce]] takes the first known photograph in history. (See [[View from the Window at Le Gras]]).
* 1832 – [[Joseph Plateau]] (Belgium) and [[Simon von Stampfer]] ([[Vienna]]) introduce simultaneously a scientific demonstration device that creates an [[optical illusion]] of movement by mounting drawings on the face of a slotted, spinning disk. Plateau's version was variously known as the "[[Phenakistoscope]]", "Phenakistiscope", "Fenakisticope" or "Fantascope", while Stampfer's version became known as the [[Stroboscope]]. The device, originally developed to demonstrate "persistence of vision", was soon marketed as a novelty toy.
* 1834 – The [[Zoetrope]] is invented. The device was a hollow drum with a strip of pictures around its inner surface. When the drum was spun and the pictures viewed through slots on the side of the drum, the pictures appeared to move. The device was first marketed only in the second half of the 1860s when several patents were taken. It was known as "Zoetrope", "Zootrope", "Wheel of Life", etc.
* 1870s – French inventor [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]] improved on the [[Zoetrope]] idea by placing mirrors at the center of the drum. He called his invention the [[Praxinoscope]]. Reynaud developed other versions of the Praxinoscope too, including a Praxinoscope Theatre, where the device was enclosed in a viewing box, and the Projecting Praxinoscope. Eventually he created the "[[Théâtre Optique]]", a large machine based on the Praxinoscope, but able to project longer animated strips. In the United States, the McLoughlin Bros. from New York released in 1879 a simplified (and unauthorized) copy of Reynaud's invention under the name "Whirligig of Life".
* 1878 – Railroad tycoon [[Leland Stanford]] hires British photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]] to settle the questions of whether a galloping horse ever had all four of its feet off the ground. Muybridge [[Sallie Gardner at a Gallop|successfully photographed]] a horse in fast motion using a series of 12 cameras controlled by trip wires. Muybridge's photos showed the horse with all four feet off the ground. Muybridge went on a lecture tour showing his photographs on a moving-image device he called the [[zoopraxiscope]]. Muybridge's experiments inspired French scientist [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] to invent equipment for recording and analyzing animal and human movement. Marey called his invention the chronophotographic camera, which was able to take multiple images superimposed on top of one another.
* 1879 – American [[George Eastman]] invents an emulsion-coating machine which enables the mass production of [[photography|photographic]] dry plates.
* 1880 – American [[George Eastman]] begins to commercially manufacture dry plates for [[photography]].
* 1880 – [[Eadweard Muybridge]] holds a public demonstration of his [[Zoopraxiscope]], a magic lantern provided with a rotating disc with artist's renderings of Muybridge's chronophotographic sequences. It was used as a demonstration device by Muybridge in his illustrated lecture (the original preserved in the Museum of [[Kingston upon Thames]] in England).
* January 1, 1881 – American inventor [[George Eastman]] founds the [[Eastman Dry Plate Company]].
* 1882 – American inventor [[George Eastman]] begins experimenting with new types of [[photographic film]], with his employee, [[William Walker (assistant)|William Walker]].
* 1882 – French physiologist [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] invents the [[chronophotographic gun]], a camera shaped like a rifle that photographs twelve successive images each second.
* 1885 – American inventors [[George Eastman]] and [[Hannibal Goodwin]] each invent a sensitized [[celluloid]] [[film base|base]] roll [[photographic film]] to replace the glass plates then in use.
* 1887 – [[Hannibal Goodwin]] files for a patent for his [[photographic film]].
* 1888 – [[George Eastman]] files for a patent for his [[photographic film]].
* 1888 – [[Thomas Edison]] meets with [[Eadweard Muybridge]] to discuss adding sound to moving pictures. Edison begins his own experiments.
* 1888 – [[Louis Le Prince|Louis Aimé Augustin Le Prince]] creates the first motion picture films created on paper rolls of film.
* 1889 – American inventor [[George Eastman]]'s [[celluloid]] [[film base|base]] roll [[photographic film]] becomes commercially available.
* June 1889 or  November 1890 – [[William K. L. Dickson]], working for [[Thomas Edison]], creates the first known motion picture films shot in the United States, the [[Monkeyshines, No. 1|Monkeyshines]] films.
* 1891 – Designed around the work of Muybridge, Marey, and Eastman, [[Thomas Edison]]'s employee [[William K. L. Dickson]] finishes work on a motion-picture camera, called the [[Kinetograph]], and a viewing machine, called the [[Kinetoscope]].
* May 20, 1891 – [[Thomas Edison]] holds the first public presentation of his [[Kinetoscope]] for the [[National Federation of Women's Clubs]].
* August 24, 1891 – [[Thomas Edison]] files for a patent of the [[Kinetoscope]].
* 1892 – [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]] begins public screenings in [[Paris]] at the [[Théâtre Optique]], with hundreds of drawings on a reel that he wound through his Zoetrope projector to construct moving images that continued for 15 minutes.
* 1892 – The [[Eastman Company]] becomes the [[Eastman Kodak Company]].
* March 14, 1893 – [[Thomas Edison]] is granted Patent #493,426 for "An Apparatus for Exhibiting Photographs of Moving Objects" (the [[Kinetoscope]]).
* 1893 – [[Thomas Edison]] builds a motion-picture studio, dubbed the "Black Maria" by his staff.
* May 9, 1893 – In America, [[Thomas Edison]] holds the first public exhibition of films shot using his [[Kinetograph]] at the [[Edison's Black Maria|Brooklyn Institute]]. Only one person at a time could use his viewing machine, the [[Kinetoscope]].
* January 7, 1894 – [[Thomas Edison]] films "[[Fred Ott's Sneeze]]" with the [[Kinetoscope]] at the "Black Maria".

* 1895 – In France, brothers named [[Auguste Lumière|Auguste]] and [[Louis Lumière]] design and build a lightweight, hand-held motion picture camera called the [[Cinématographe]]. The Lumière brothers discover that their machine can also be used to project images onto a large screen. The Lumière brothers created several short films at this time that are considered to be pivotal in the history of motion pictures.
* November 1895 – In Germany, [[Emil Skladanowsky|Emil]] and [[Max Skladanowsky]] develop their own film projector.
* December 1895 – In France, [[Auguste Lumière|Auguste]] and [[Louis Lumière]] hold their first public screening of films shot with their [[Cinématographe]].

There they encounter numerous now extinct animals, including dinosaurs.  The film was released on 10 August 2012 in India and received mostly negative reviews. According to ''[[The Times of India]]'', the director of the film failed as a storyteller and the film was "a bland Jurassic adventure".&lt;ref name="Adhisaya Ulagam review"/&gt;

== Plot ==
Professor Neelakantan ([[Livingston (actor)|J. Livingston]]) is an maverick Indian scientist and inventor who develops and constructs a [[Time travel|time machine]], and begins experimenting with it. He realises that his machine requires a recognised "object" to work, and he therefore seeks to locate such an object that can be transported in time through his machine. He jokingly tells his pet dog that he would use it as the "object".

Varsha (Sreelakhsmy N. Nair) and Vikas (Prithvi) are Neelakantan's mischievous granddaughter and grandson who live with their parents and are very fond of the grandfather.  While on a visit, the two children enter Neelakantan's laboratory in his absence and start playing with the dog. Varsha throws a ball that strikes the time machine's control screen and accidentally turns on the device, which recognises Varsha and Vikas as transferable "objects". Neelakantan enters the room and is shocked to see the machine's condition, but it is too late. As he tries to save the kids, he too is recognised as an "object" by the machine, and his grandchildren and he are accidentally transported to the age of dinosaurs.

In the prehistoric world Neelakantan and his grandchildren encounter animals that are now [[extinct]], including several species of dangerous [[dinosaur]]s. At first they are afraid and struggle to understand what to do. But, gradually they try to be friends with a dinosaurs. They wish to return to the modern times, but for that they would require a source of electricity, which does not exist in the prehistoric times they have been transported to. How they survive their circumstances and finally manage to return to their own age is the main plot of the film.

They wrote, "But when even the five-year-old kids in the theatre get restless, it is a clear sign that the filmmaker has failed as a storyteller."&lt;ref name="Adhisaya Ulagam review"&gt;{{cite news|title=Adhisaya Ulagam review|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/regional/tamil/movie-reviews/Adhisaya-Ulagam/movie-review/15447935.cms|accessdate=16 September 2013|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''All My Friends Are Leaving Brisbane''''' is a 2007 Australian [[romantic comedy]] film directed by [[Louise Alston]] and written by [[Stephen Vagg]]. It follows Anthea, a 25-year-old girl who hates her job and has to sit back and watch as all her friends move away from her hometown, [[Brisbane]], to make a better life. In 2013, ''[[The Guardian]]'' referred to it as a "cult film" inspired by "a typically Brisbane lament... the departure of people in their late 20s to Sydney, Melbourne, London or New York."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/13/all-my-friends-leaving-brisbane Luke Royes, "Are all my friends leaving Brisbane?", ''The Guardian'' 13 June 2013] accessed 18 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Anthea (Charlotte Gregg) is undergoing a crisis of confidence: overworked, no boyfriend, and now all her friends are leaving Brisbane. She is tempted to leave herself, but is opposed by her longtime best platonic male friend Michael (Matt Zeremes).

Michael thinks people who leave Brisbane are copycats who follow the crowd; he is quite happy to stay in Brisbane, he is in a stable job and a stable very low-maintenance "sex-with-the-ex" relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Stephanie (Sarah Kennedy). In short, he is in a rut.

Anthea's temptation to leave Brisbane increases with the impending departure of her flatmate Kath (Cindy Nelson). However, she then hears that her ex-boyfriend Jake (Gyton Grantley) is coming back to Brisbane to live. To Michael's annoyance, she dreams of a great future with him.

Michael is then thrown out of his comfort zone by starting a new relationship with a girl he meets at work; Simone (Romany Lee). Slightly "alternative" and good natured, Simone is totally different from the sorts of girls he normally deals with, and he finds himself in a relationship over which he does not have total control.

On her last day in Australia, Anthea and Michael finally resolve their feelings for each other.

==Production==
Originally, ''All My Friends are Leaving Brisbane'' was a stage performance at the [[University of Queensland]]'s Cement Box Theatre, where director Louise Alston first saw it. She could see that the story would make an ideal feature film and worked with writer Stephen Vagg on developing a script.

Producer [[Jade van der Lei]] then became interested in the film and was able to raise a budget of {{A$|42,000}}. The film was shot in the middle of a Queensland summer, January 2006, over a three-week period. Afterward, The filmmakers successfully applied for [[post-production]] funding from the [[Australian Film Commission]], which enabled additional shooting. The film completed post-production in early 2007 and made its world debut at the 2007 [[Brisbane International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://reviews.media-culture.org.au/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2147 | title=Cinema Interview: ''All My Friends are Leaving Brisbane'' | first=Tim | last=Milfull | publisher=M/C Reviews | accessdate=9 April 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312034104/http://www.reviews.media-culture.org.au/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2147 | archive-date=12 March 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }} Interview with Louise Alston.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''BMX XXX''''' is a [[Sports game|sports]] [[video game]] developed by [[Z-Axis]] and published by [[Acclaim Entertainment]] under their AKA Acclaim label for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[GameCube]]. While primarily a [[BMX]]-based [[action sports]] title, it earned most of its notoriety for containing [[nudity]], [[foul language]] and adult humor. The game allows the player to create female characters that are fully [[Toplessness|topless]] and view live-action video clips of real life [[stripper]]s, also with bare [[breasts]]. Consequently, ''BMX XXX'' was initially denied classification in Australia. In North America, while the game is available uncensored on the GameCube and Xbox, all naked breasts are covered in the PlayStation 2 version. While the adult content garnered a great deal of publicity for the game, it was almost entirely negative, and it was eventually released to mediocre reviews and poor sales.

==Production==
''BMX XXX'' builds on the earlier work done by Z-Axis on ''[[Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX]]'', their previous BMX title featuring and endorsed by professional [[BMX rider]] [[Dave Mirra]]. During development of the new game, publisher [[Acclaim Entertainment]] decided to style the game after a raunchy [[sex comedy]] movie. It is commonly believed that the origins of this decision came when Acclaim saw what was shaping up to be an extremely subpar game, and so, in an effort to salvage the time and money already invested in it, they decided to add the vulgar humor and naked women in an effort to muster up [[publicity]] and hopefully turn that into sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=IGN staff |title=E3 2002: Dave Mirra BMX XXX |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/22/e3-2002-dave-mirra-bmx-xxx |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=May 22, 2002 |accessdate=March 17, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325142434/http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/22/e3-2002-dave-mirra-bmx-xxx# |archive-date=2016-03-25 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Mirra found out about the content in the game, he refused to [[Testimonial|endorse]] the product and took legal action against publisher [[Acclaim Entertainment|Acclaim]] in order to prevent any further implication of his involvement in the game.&lt;ref name="videogames.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=IGN staff |title=Dave Mirra Sues Acclaim |url=http://videogames.yahoo.com/news-1118429 |publisher=[[Yahoo!

The game received "mixed" reviews on all platforms according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=MCGC/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCPS2/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCXB/&gt;

===Controversy===
At the time of ''BMX XXX'''s release, sexual humor and nudity were not widely explored themes in mainstream video games.&lt;ref name="videogames.yahoo.com"/&gt; As a result, Acclaim's attempt to drum up publicity for the game was a rousing success, although the publicity achieved was not positive. Television news outlets reported that [[Wal-Mart]], [[Toys R Us]] and most major [[Interactive Entertainment Merchants Association|IEMA]] retailers in the [[United States]] declined to carry the game in their stores due to the nudity. Then, [[Sony Computer Entertainment of America]] refused to allow the game to be published for the [[PlayStation 2]] until the nudity was [[censored]]. In the end, sales were abysmal: under 100,000 copies were sold across all three platforms. The game was not greeted with controversy in [[Europe]], but it was not met with sales success either. In [[Australia]], it was sold with the sexual content removed entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Game Power Australia Team |title=Acclaim Australia: BMX XXX Interview |url=http://www.gamepower.com.au/?aid=1069 |publisher=Game Power Australia |date=November 8, 2002 |accessdate=November 27, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212034614/http://www.gamepower.com.au/?aid=1069 |archivedate=12 December 2007&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''BMX XXX'', along with several other poorly performing titles, contributed to Acclaim Entertainment filing for bankruptcy in 2004.

'''Bahuk''' ({{lang-gu|બાહુક}}) is a [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] [[Narrative poetry|long narrative poem]] by [[Chinu Modi]].&lt;ref name="Saccidānandan2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saccidānandan|title=Indian Poetry: Modernism and After : a Seminar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AXiNXRM_KzMC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=2 January 2017|year=2001|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1092-9|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem is composed both in [[metre (poetry)|metrical]] and non-metrical verse and centres on [[Nala]], a character from the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' who metamorphosed into [[Bahuka]]. It is an acclaimed poem of [[Gujarati literature]] written in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]-styled figurative language. The poem was selected for the [[Ushnas Prize]] (1982–83) by the [[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]].&lt;ref name= "bk"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Topiwala |first=Chandrakant |author-link=Chandrakant Topiwala|encyclopedia=Gujarati Sahityakosh (Encyclopedia of Gujarati Literature) |title=Bahuk |language= Gujarati |year=1990 |publisher= [[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]] |volume=2 |location=Ahmedabad |pages=394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and publication history ==
[[File:Chinu Modi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Chinu Modi]]
Chinu Modi began writing Bahuk in 1971. He suspended work between 1979 and 1981, on receiving a creative fellowship from the [[Ministry of Culture (India)|Department of Culture]] in [[Delhi]], before going on to complete the poem in October 1982.&lt;ref name="Sahityasetu"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raval |first=Dipak | title=બાહુક અને જટાયુ | date=May–June 2013 | website=Sahityasetu – A Literary e-journal | url=http://www.sahityasetu.co.in/issue15/dipakraval.php | language=gu | access-date=2018-02-20 |issn=2249-2372 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahuk was published in book form in January 1983 by Adarsh Publication, [[Ahmedabad]], and reprinted in 1999. A third edition, including critical articles, was published in October 2014.&lt;ref name= "cm"&gt;{{cite book |last=Modi |first=Chinu |date=2014 |title= Bahuk |location=Ahmedabad |publisher=Adarsh Publication |page=3 |isbn= 978-93-82593-79-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
* [[Nala]], the king of [[Nishada Kingdom|Nishadnagar]], who lost his empire to his brother [[Pushkara]] in a bet.
* [[Damayanti]], princess of the [[Vidarbha Kingdom]] and wife of Nala.
* Brihadashwa, a sage.

During his exile, [[Pandava]] king [[Yudhishthira]] asked Brihadashwa, "Is there any other emperor in this wood who is unfortunate as me?". At that time, Brihadashwa consoled him by narrating [[The Story of Nal and Damayanti in Bhakti and Sufism Accounts|the story of Nala and Damayanti]]. In China Modi's poem, the sage Brihadashwa comes into his own as an independent character and observer.&lt;ref name="Sahityasetu"/&gt;

== Theme ==
The subject of the poem is [[The Story of Nal and Damayanti in Bhakti and Sufism Accounts|the story of Nala and Damayanti]] from chapter 27 chapter of the ''[[Vana Parva]]'', third ''[[Mahabharata#The 18 parvas or books|parva]]'' (book) of the ''Mahabharata''. The poem's central theme is the psyche and subtle emotions of Nala, and of his wife Damayanti. After losing his empire to his brother [[Pushkara]] in a bet, Nala spends three days and nights outside his city, Nishadnagar, with Damayanti, before going into the forest. Cut off from his city, Nala feels extreme loneliness. The poem depicts the dissolution of his personality during these three days and nights.&lt;ref name= "bk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sahityasetu"/&gt;

== Structure and techniques ==
The poem is divided into three ''sarga'' (cantos). The first contains 15 chapters, the second 13 chapters, and the third 22 chapters. The three characters do not communicate with each other but speak in independent monologues.&lt;br/&gt;

The chronological order of narrator monologues is as follows:

* Sarga 1 : Brihadashwa, Nala, Damayanti
* Sarga 2 : Brihadashwa, Nala, Damayanti
* Sarga 3 : Damayanti, Brihadashwa, Nala

The first and second sargas are composed in [[free verse|non-metrical verse]]. The third is composed in accordance with the rules of ''Sanskrit-vritta'' ([[Sanskrit prosody]]) and ''Matra-vritta'', including ''Prithvi'', ''Vasantatilka'', ''Mandakranta'', ''Shikhrini'', ''Chopai'' and ''Katav''. The poem is structured using Sanskrit-styled and figurative language. The narrative comprises long monologues from the three characters, Nala, Damayanti, and Brihadashwa. Brihadashwa and Damayanti's monologues centre alternately on Nala and his psyche, reflecting the affection they hold for Nala. The poet reinterprets the two accounts in the original story, ''"Karkotaka dankh"'' ("The sting of [[Karkotaka]]") and ''"Matsya Sajivan Prasang"''. In the original story, a bite from the snake Karkotaka transforms Nala into [[Bahuka]].   In the poem, Chinu Modi describes Nala's metamorphosis into Bahuka as being caused by natural phenomena.&lt;ref name="Sahityasetu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bhayani |first=Harivallabh |author-link=Harivallabh Bhayani |date= |title=Kavyakautuk (Collection of Critical Articles) |location=Bombay |publisher=S.N.D.T Women's University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
=== ''Sarga'' 1 ===
The first ''sarga'' (canto) begins with three visions of Brihadashwa: the arrival of victorious Pushkara in the town Nishadanagar; the citizens' fear at his arrival; and victorious Pushkara's emotions and Nala's numbness. There follows a description of Nala's despair at being cut off from his city. The ''sarga'' concludes with Damayanti's thoughts and feelings on Nala's situation.&lt;ref name= "cm"/&gt;

=== ''Sarga'' 2 ===
The second ''sarga'' begins with Brihadashwa's address to the ''Vrukharaj'' (a [[banyan]] tree) and some other elements of nature at the border of Nishadanagar concerning Nala's mental state. Nala's monologue follows, reflecting his stillness, his passivity and lifelessness, and his growing consciousness of these things. Finally, Damayanti's monologue reveals her own state of mind in certain lines, with the remainder concerning Nala. Damayanti addresses Nala, attempting to rouse him from his numbed state. The entire monologue uses the technique of Indication.&lt;ref name= "cm"/&gt;

=== ''Sarga 3'' ===
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Mahabharata - NalaDamayanti.jpg|thumb|Nala leaving Damayanthi while she is sleeping; painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]|upright=0.8]]
The third ''sarga'' begins with Damayanti’s monologue describing Nala’s mental state through the symbol of the banyan tree ''Vruksharaj'' and other elements of nature. Damayanti attempts to convince Nala to accept his new situation. Brihadashva’s monologue follows, describing Nala's situation using natural imagery such as darkness and the forest. At the beginning of the final monologue, by Nala, Nala finds a golden, fleshy bird. Hungry, he finds the bird fit to eat. This is the point ay which his transformation into Bahuka commences. He makes a snare out of his only cloth to catch the bird, but it flies away carrying the cloth. Nala is left naked and feels his individuality dissolving, with a deep sense of grief. Finally, Nala turns into Bahuka, not as a result of the snake Karkotaka's bite as in the original story in the ''Mahabharata'', but through the sting of loneliness. He leaves Damayanti and wanders away into the forest. The episode that begins with Nala’s desire to kill the bird closes with Nala leaving Damayanti, revealing his uglier side. The Nala of the poem is written as a displaced person.&lt;ref name= "cm"/&gt;

== Award ==
The book was awarded the [[Ushnas Prize]] (1982–83) by the [[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]] (Gujarati Literary Council).&lt;ref name= "an"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brahmbhatt |first=Prasad |date=2014 |title= History of Modern Gujarati Literature (Modern &amp; Post Modern Era) |location=Ahmedabad |publisher= Parshva Publication |page=407 |isbn= 978-93-5108-247-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical response ==
The poem has been critically acclaimed by several [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] authors. [[Harivallabh Bhayani]] noted that [[Chinu Modi]] has broken new ground in modern Gujarati long narrative poetry (Khandakavya) with his attempts at [[Narrative poetry|narrative poems]]. [[Chandrakant Topiwala]] noted, "In Gujarati literature, poets like [[Ravji Patel]], and [[Raghuvir Chaudhari]] have written poem on separation from village when they moved from village to city. But here for the first time, Chinu Modi has grabbed the opportunity to writing on separation from the city as the lead character is separated from the city and moving to woods". In this, he has described the pain of personal separation in a modern context. However, in one article [[Pramodkumar Patel]] questioned the psychological role and the truthfulness and authenticity of the emotions of the character Damayanti. He noted that Damayanti's behavior runs counter to reality in some instances in the poem.&lt;ref name= "an"/&gt;

== Translation and adaptation ==
Chinu Modi adapted the poem as two-act Gujarati play in 1991. In the production, Himanshu Trivedi played the role of Nala and Asma Dalal played Damayanti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Desai|first=S.D.|title=More Happenings: Gujarati Theatre Today (1990 - 1999)|date=December 2002|publisher=[[Gujarat Sahitya Academy]]|location=Gandhinagar|pages=63|isbn=81-7227-113-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was translated into [[Hindi]] by Kavita Sharma 'Jadli' in 2017.

== History ==
On January 10, 2016 [[CJ E&amp;M]] announced that they were investing 25 billion won ($20.6 million) over the next three years in a new [[boy band]] to perform throughout the year at a permanent venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Eun-jin|last=Jung|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160110000359|title=CJ E&amp;M launches mega K-pop project ‘Boys 24’|publisher=Kpop Herald|accessdate=December 15, 2016|date=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; CJ E&amp;M had named the boy band and project name “Boys24”, to air the whole process from selecting members to performing in front of audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kpopherald.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=201601101351114335675_2|title=CJ to invest $20m in nurturing 24-member boy band|accessdate=December 9, 2016|publisher=Kpop Herald|date=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concept of Boys24===

First, Ahn Seok-joon set the stage of 'Boys24' as four stages, the first being 'excavation'. Of the total of 5500 applicants, 49 were selected by Mnet.com as untreated gemstones. The second stage was 'competition'. The unfinished 49 people formed a total of seven unit teams, where they would vividly confirm their intense competition. The third stage was 'growth', a process of the birth of a 24-member Boys24, which would be confirmed in the theater. The final stage was 'evolution'. It could be said that they had evolved to become a crystal, and among the 24 people, a few select members who had the highest level in all aspects would make their debut as an idol group. They would enter the world of 'pro' and start full-scale activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tenasia.hankyung.com/archives/957119|title=[TEN 현장] ‘소년24’, ‘프로듀스101’, AKB48과 달라야 한다|accessdate=June 16, 2016|language=ko|first=Hajin|last=Kim|publisher=Tenasia|date=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8282">The '''Celebrities Rights Act''' or '''Celebrity Rights Act''' was passed in [[California]] in 1985, which enabled a [[celebrity]]'s [[personality rights]] to survive his or her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Friedemann O’Brien Goldberg &amp; Zarian Names Bela G. Lugosi Of Counsel |url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/bela021402.htm |quote=But an appeals court overturned that decision and finally in 1979, the California Supreme Court, in Lugosi v. Universal Pictures, ruled that Lugosi did not inherit any rights that Universal Pictures infringed. It said the Lugosi name and likeness could not pass on to the actor’s heirs, since the right of publicity died with Lugosi. However, the California Assembly passed a ''Celebrities Rights Act'' in 1985 which said that rights of publicity survive the celebrity’s death and descend to heirs by wills, among other means. |publisher=Metropolitan News-Enterprise |date= |accessdate=2008-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the 1979 ''[[Lugosi v. Universal Pictures]]'' decision by the [[California Supreme Court]] held that [[Bela Lugosi]]'s personality rights could not pass to his heirs, as a [[copyright]] would have. The court ruled that any rights of publicity, and rights to his image, terminated with Lugosi's death.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Who Can Inherit Fame? |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952724,00.html |quote=Ten years later, the son and the widow of [[Bela Lugosi]], star of the Dracula films, tried to take this doctrine a step further. They argued that this right was essentially property and therefore should pass on to heirs. In a California suit, they asked the courts to stop [[Universal Pictures]] from merchandising 70 Dracula products, ranging from jigsaw puzzles to belt buckles, and sought compensation based on the profits. Citing the First Amendment, Universal replied that the design of merchandise is a form of free speech that should not be restrained by anyone's heirs. Besides, said Universal's lawyer, Robert Wilson, Lugosi "attained fame and fortune because the company made and distributed the movies he starred in." After eleven years of wrangling, a trial judge decided in favor of the Lugosis, giving them $70,000 and barring Universal from merchandising Lugosi's likeness. |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |date= July 7, 1980|accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[California Civil Code]] section 3344'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oclaw.org/research/code/ca/CIV/3344./content.html Cal. Civ. Code §3344]&lt;/ref&gt; is for the publicity rights of living persons, while '''Civil Code section 3344.1''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oclaw.org/research/code/ca/CIV/3344.1./content.html Cal. Civ. Code §3344.1]&lt;/ref&gt; known as the ''[[Fred Astaire|Astaire]] Celebrity Image Protection Act'', grants statutory ''[[wiktionary:post mortem|post mortem]]'' rights to the estate of a "deceased personality", where:

:* that personality had been "any natural person whose name, voice, signature, photograph, or likeness has commercial value at the time of his or her death",&lt;ref&gt;California Civil Code § 3344.1(h)&lt;/ref&gt;
:* any person using such personality's "name, voice, signature, photograph or likeness on or in products, merchandise or goods" without prior consent was liable to be sued for damages and profits arising from the unauthorized use,&lt;ref&gt;California Civil Code § 3344.1(a)(1)&lt;/ref&gt; and
:* such prior consent may only be given by persons to whom the personality had transferred such power by contract or trust prior to his death, or by trust or will after his death, or, where no such latter provision was made, his spouse, children, and/or grandchildren,&lt;ref&gt;California Civil Code § 3344.1(c)&lt;/ref&gt; but
:* "a play, book, magazine, newspaper, musical composition, audiovisual work, radio or television program, single and original work of art, work of political or newsworthy value, or an advertisement or commercial announcement for any of these works, shall not be considered a product, article of merchandise, good, or service if it is fictional or nonfictional entertainment, or a dramatic, literary, or musical work."&lt;ref&gt;California Civil Code § 3344.1(a)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the period of protection was extended from fifty years after a person's death to seventy years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = California’s amended right of publicity statute (California Civil Code § 3344.1)|url = http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=4b6425b0-e86f-4445-96a5-19be1ea37265|publisher = Lexology|date = 2008-03-03|accessdate = 2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar laws have been enacted by 12 other states in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Letter from Memphis|url = http://www.studio-international.co.uk/reports/elvis.asp|publisher = Studio International|date = 2003-05-30|accessdate = 2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==
* In 1998 [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]]'s estate sued the [[Franklin Mint]] for selling products bearing her likeness. The lawsuit filed May 18, 1998 in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles said the Franklin Mint "failed to obtain consent to use Princess Diana's identity and trademark ... and embarked on a campaign to profit from Princess Diana's death."  On June 27, 2000, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California issued a summary judgment in favor of the Franklin Mint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Too famous to trademark: Diana case proves point -- The National Law Journal, Oct. 16 2000, Section C |url=http://www.venable.com/files/Publication/7cb72097-72a6-4faa-bfe6-dd21f7999a21/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/ba8a1668-81ec-4559-b739-35bf0e866f61/1105.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Franklin Mint countersued Diana's estate's lawyers for "malicious prosecution of trademark"—in January 2011 the law firm settled with a $25 million payment to the former owners of the Franklin Mint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The AmLaw Daily, January 21, 2011 |url=http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2011/01/manattsettlement.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Shaw Family Archives Ltd. v. CMG Worldwide, Inc.'', 486 F.Supp.2d 309 (S.D.N.Y., 2007) ruled on May 7, 2007 that in regard to Marilyn Monroe, because she died before California's Celebrity Rights Act was passed in 1985, and the state of New York does not recognize a right of publicity after the artist's death, her name, image, and voice are now in the public domain in the states of California and New York. By implication, they would also be in the public domain in any state that, at the time of Monroe's death in 1962, did not recognize a right of publicity that survived the artist's death. In response to that court ruling, California passed legislation that created [[descendible]] rights of publicity that last 70 years after death, retroactively for any person deceased after January 1, 1938.&lt;ref&gt;David Walker, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20071214103439/http://www.pdn-pix.com/pdn/newswire/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003658099]", ''PDNonline''.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar law has failed in the [[New York Legislature]].

==History==
Jack Davis, who was still attending [[Duke University]] at the time, met [[Eli Roth]] at a dinner party in 2013. The pair kept in touch, discussing how to make scary entertainment effective on phone screens.&lt;ref name="adweek" /&gt; Crypt TV was formed when Davis and [[Eli Roth|Roth]] launched a "six-second scare" contest together in October 2014,&lt;ref name="6second"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/eli-roth-vine-horror-6secondscare-852488/|title=Eli Roth Launches Vine Talent Search, Will Develop Original Idea With Winner|work=Deadline|date=2014-10-15|author=Yamato, Jen|accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "a way to test to see if you could really make great scary content in short form on mobile,” according to Davis.&lt;ref name="adweek" /&gt; The contest was featured on [[Good Morning America]] and subsequently went viral, receiving over 15,000 submissions.&lt;ref name="millennial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://millennialmagazine.com/2018/02/28/jack-davis-gives-new-life-to-monsters-with-crypttv/|title=Jack Davis Gives New Life to Monsters with CryptTV|work=Millennial Magazine|date=2018-02-28|accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth showed the contest to [[Jason Blum]], who was looking for a digital strategy for [[Blumhouse Productions]], and Blum became Crypt's first investor. The company was officially launched in April 2015 in Los Angeles with just three employees: Davis, Darren Brandl as Chief Operating Officer, and Kate Krantz as Chief Content Officer.&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt;

In March 2017, Crypt TV raised $3.5 million in funding, led by venture capital fund [[Lerer Hippeau Ventures]], a backer of Buzzfeed.&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt; The company has raised $6.2 million from past investors.&lt;ref name="latimes2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-crypt-tv-funding-20180327-story.html|title=Digital horror startup Crypt TV raises $6.2 million to fund growth|work=Los Angeles Times|author=Faughnder, Ryan|date=2018-03-27|accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and distribution==
Crypt releases about 100 videos every three months, building its audience through Facebook and YouTube and averaging more than 100 million online views a month.&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes2" /&gt; Using real-time reactions on social media to test characters and concepts, the most well-received characters are inducted into Crypt's "monster universe," who then form the basis for as many as 15 videos in a quarter.&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt; Giggles the Clown, The Look-See, and Sunny Family Cult are among the most popular series developed this way.&lt;ref name="thebirch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2017/01/13/crypt-tv-the-birch-short-film/|title=Character-Driven Short Film ‘The Birch’ Crosses 10 Million Views As Crypt TV Screams Into 2017|work=TubeFilter|author=Gutelle, Sam|date=2017-01-13|accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crypt's viral characters expand beyond traditional narrative videos; Giggles the Clown does live streaming interviews with fans, engaging on social media as a typical influencer would, and she has appeared as an attraction at [[Knott's Scary Farm]].&lt;ref name="giggles"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2017/06/19/giggles-the-clown-crypt-tv-facebook/|title=Through Giggles The Clown, Crypt TV Turns One Of Its Characters Into An Online Video Star|website=TubeFilter.com|date=2017-06-19|author=Gutelle, Sam|accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crypt also has a merchandising deal with [[Spencer's Gifts]], which sells merchandise for Giggles, the Birch, and Sunny Family Cult.&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt;

'''E!''' (originally an [[initialism]] of '''Entertainment Television''') is an American [[Cable television in the United States#Basic cable|basic cable]] and [[satellite television]] [[cable channel|channel]] that is owned by the [[NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group]] division of [[NBCUniversal]], all owned by [[Comcast]].

As of January 2016, E! is available to 92.4 million households in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590 |title=Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Movietime===
E! was originally launched on July 31, 1987, as '''Movietime''', a service that aired movie trailers, entertainment news, event and awards coverage, and interviews as an early example of a national [[barker channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DD173CF930A35755C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=|work=The New York Times|first= Jeremy|last=Gerard|title=TELEVISION; Fledgling Cable Networks Are Poised for Flight|date=June 3, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel was founded by [[Larry Namer]] and [[Alan Mruvka]].&lt;ref name="BOOK1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Slide|first=Anthony|title=The television industry: a historical dictionary|publisher=[[Greenwood Press]] |year=1991 |edition=illustrated|page=94|isbn=9780313256349|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4EYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=alan-mruvka&amp;dq=alan-mruvka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/30/business/advertising-promoting-movies-via-cable.html|title=Advertising; Promoting Movies Via Cable|last=Dougherty |first=Philip H.|date=July 30, 1987|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Movietime hosts included [[Greg Kinnear]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Katie Wagner]], [[Julie Moran]], Suzanne Kay (daughter of [[Diahann Carroll]]), [[Mark DeCarlo]], [[Sam Rubin]] and [[Richard Blade]].

===E!===
[[File:E! Logo.svg|thumb|left|75px|E!'s logo from the launch under that branding. Used from June 1, 1990 until July 9, 2012 for the US flagship channel. Still in use for many of E!'s international networks.]]
Controlling ownership was originally held by a [[consortium]] of five cable television providers ([[Comcast]], [[Continental Cablevision]], [[Cox Communications|Cox Cable]], [[Tele-Communications Inc.|TCI]], and [[Warner Cable]]), [[HBO]]/[[Warner Communications]], and various founding shareholders, with HBO directly programming and managing the network. In 1989, after [[Time-Life]] bought Warner Communications to fend off a takeover bid by Paramount, the new [[Time Warner]] company held four of the eight major ownership positions and took over management control of Movietime and renamed the network as '''E!: Entertainment Television''' on June 1, 1990; this name change was made to emphasize its widening coverage of the [[celebrity–industrial complex]], contemporary film, television and music, daily Hollywood gossip, and fashion.

In 1997, Comcast, one of the minority partners, teamed up with [[Disney–ABC Television Group|Disney/ABC Cable Networks]] to buy the channel after Time-Warner had exercised their put agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19020738.html Comcast Corp. Gains Exclusive Right to Buy E! Entertainment], Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News (originated from ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''; via [[HighBeam Research]]), January 11, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Comcast increased the ownership stakes in the network through mergers with forerunners of TCI and Continental under various circumstances. In November 2006, Comcast acquired Disney's 39.5% share of E! for $1.23 billion to gain full ownership of the network as part of a broader programming carriage agreement between Disney/ABC and Comcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.comcast.com/About/PressRelease/PressReleaseDetail.ashx?PRID=24|title= Comcast and the Walt Disney Company Announce Long-Term Comprehensive Distribution Agreements Securing Carriage for Disney Media Networks’ Products and Services|publisher=[[Comcast]]|accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Comcast Entertainment Group, the company's television unit, became a division of the [[NBCUniversal Television Group]], after Comcast acquired a 51% majority stake in NBCUniversal from [[General Electric]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/183652/nbcuniversalcomcast_merger_what_we_do_and_dont_know.html NBC-Universal-Comcast Merger: What We Do and Don't Know], ''[[PC World (magazine)|PCWorld]]'', December 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; E!'s only sister networks prior to the NBC Universal merger were the now-defunct channels Style Network (then [[Esquire Network]]) and [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]], along with Comcast's sports networks: Versus, [[Comcast SportsNet]] and [[Golf Channel]]. In the case of Versus, E! staff produced that network's ''[[Sports Soup]]'' and G4's ''[[Web Soup]]'', while the Orlando-based Golf Channel featured no crossovers with E! at all due to incompatible audiences and operations. Versus and Golf Channel were taken under the direct control of the [[NBC Sports]] division, with the former being renamed [[NBC Sports Network]] in January 2012, and are no longer connected to their former sister networks beyond advertising and in-house operations.

On July 9, 2012, the channel introduced a revised logo (the first change to its logo since the network rebranded as E! in 1990), removing the [[exclamation mark]] background behind the "E" but keeping the exclamation point underneath, along with a new slogan "Pop of Culture", which coincided with the launch of the new series ''[[Opening Act]]''. The network also started the process of introducing scripted programming (the first series, ''[[The Royals (TV series)|The Royals]]'', premiering in March 2015), in addition to its existing reality and documentary series. The changes were announced during E!'s programming upfront presentation on April 30, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/e-new-logo-pop-of-culture-tagline-318032 E! Unveils New Logo, 'Pop of Culture' Tagline], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', April 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
{{main|List of programs broadcast by E!}}

===News===
{{see also|E! News}}
E! is one of the few U.S. general-entertainment cable channels that broadcasts a daily news program; its flagship entertainment news program is ''[[E! News]]'', which debuted on September 1, 1991. The weekday program (which also has an hour-long weekend edition) features stories and gossip about celebrities, and the film, music and television industries, and has been broadcast under various formats since its launch, even being aired live for a time during the mid-2000s. It was first hosted by Dagny Hultgreen. Steve Kmetko was a host from 1994-2002.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} It has been hosted by [[Terrence Jenkins]] and [[Giuliana Rancic]] since 2012 and 2006, respectively, with [[Ryan Seacrest]] (who co-anchored the program from 2006 to 2012) serving as [[managing editor]] of the news operation.

''E! News'' was the only entertainment news show on the channel for much of its history until 2006, when the channel launched ''[[The Daily 10]]'', hosted by [[Sal Masekela]] and [[Catt Sadler]] ([[Debbie Matenopoulos]] also co-hosted from the show's inception until 2008); the series was cancelled in September 2010 after E! announced that the weekday editions of ''E! News'' would be expanded to one hour starting on October 25, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/457412-E_Expands_Weeknight_Newscast_To_One_Hour.php E! Expands Weeknight Newscast To One Hour] 2011 NewBay Media September 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

E! also carried a [[simulcast]] of business news channel [[Bloomberg Television]] from 2004 to January 2009, when the latter network had expanded its cable and satellite carriage to a level that allowed the discontinuation of the simulcast. During its time on E!, the 5 to 8 a.m. block was the most watched period for the network, according to [[Nielsen Media Research]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Outside ''E! News'' telecasts, the channel runs an ''E! News''–branded ticker displaying entertainment news headlines each half-hour during regular programming (except during airings of ''E! News'' and ''The Soup'', and the channel's early morning infomercial block) which is updated daily; fast-breaking entertainment headlines (such as a celebrity arrest or death) may also be displayed on a ticker, during any program when warranted.

===Original series===
E! is known for its live red carpet pre-shows for the industry's three prominent award shows, the [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, the [[Golden Globe Award]]s, and the [[Academy Awards]], and were famous for their fashion critiques by [[Joan Rivers]]; Rivers also hosted post-awards specials under the title ''[[Fashion Police]]'', which became a regular weekly series in September 2010. In April 2017, it was announced that E! had acquired the [[People's Choice Awards]], which will move to the network from [[CBS]] in 2018 with a new November scheduling. The network promoted that the show would be given an "end-to-end" experience that will leverage its existing experience in awards show coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/12/peoples-choice-awards-premiere-date-e-den-of-thieves-jesse-ignjatovic-evan-prager-1202226809/|title=People’s Choice Awards Sets Premiere Date For Inaugural Telecast On E!|last=Ramos|first=Dino-Ray|date=2017-12-14|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/04/peoples-choice-awards-cbs-e-1202063827/|title=People’s Choice Awards Moves From CBS To E!|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=2017-04-06|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network also produces many documentary and biographical series, most notably ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]''; many of E!'s original specials are entertainment-related ranging from light fare (such as ''25 Cutest Child Stars All Grown Up'') to serious fare (such as ''15 Most Unforgettable Hollywood Tragedies''). It also produces specials centering on investigative and crime stories including ''E! Investigates'', which features topical investigative reports on subjects ranging from [[child prostitution]] to [[teenage pregnancy]].

In recent years, the network has become known for its [[reality television]] programs. Its most popular series as of 2011 is ''[[Keeping Up with the Kardashians]]'', which has spawned three [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] (''[[Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami]]'', ''[[Kourtney and Kim Take New York]]'', and ''[[Khloe and Lamar]]''). Other original programming airing on the network included weekly version of ''[[Fashion Police (TV series)|Fashion Police]]'' (which continues as post-awards ceremony specials).

E! has had three comedy programs: the late night talk show ''[[Chelsea Lately]]'', hosted by comedian [[Chelsea Handler]], its scripted/improvised spin-off ''[[After Lately]]'', and ''[[The Soup]]'' (based on the popular 1991-2002 E! series ''[[Talk Soup]]''), featuring clips of the previous week's TV shows with humorous commentary delivered by the host, actor/comedian [[Joel McHale]]. Handler also produced ''[[Love You, Mean It with Whitney Cummings|Love You, Mean It]]'', a weekly comedic look at pop culture hosted by [[Whitney Cummings]].

===Acquired series and films===
Over the years, E! has occasionally run acquired programming including reruns of ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'', ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'' lifestyle-based interview shows from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (since removed under NBCUniversal ownership), and edited 60-minute versions of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', though fewer of these programs currently air.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.marketingmag.ca/news/media-news/out-with-the-e-in-with-the-new-at-canwest-upfront-8989|title=Out with the E!, in with the new at Canwest upfront|work=[[Marketing (magazine)|Marketing Magazine]]|date=June 3, 2009|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only programming currently airing on E! that it does not produce are [[standards and practices|broadcast standards-edited]] reruns of the former [[HBO]] series ''[[Sex and the City]]'' originally carried by HBO's sister network [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], and [[feature film]]s that air under the banner "Movies We Love"; the latter was part of a since-abandoned initiative by the network to use films to increase the network's ratings, though the branding remains, and low and mid-grossing female focused films from the [[Universal Pictures]] library usually receive their basic cable premiere on E!, with higher-grossing films premiering on [[USA Network]]. The network has aired same-week runs of NBC series (such as ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]'', ''[[Fashion Star]]'', ''[[Whitney (TV series)|Whitney]]'', and ''[[Are You There, Chelsea?]]''), and in the past aired previews of G4 programming to give that network an extended promotional platform due to their lowered carriage when it was removed from [[DirecTV]] in November 2010.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==E! HD==
'''E! HD''' is a [[High-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed of E! that launched on December 8, 2008; like the rest of E!'s sister lifestyle and sports networks owned by former parent [[Comcast Entertainment Group]] and subsequently the NBC cable networks, the feed broadcasts in the [[1080i]] resolution format. Currently, filmed program content and all of the network's post-2010 programs, along with limited pre-2010 content is carried in the format, with HD programming airing in a [[letterbox]] format on the SD channel (some films remain in [[480i]] due to contractual or technical reasons). The HD feed is available on most cable and telco providers, along with both satellite services.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

During E!'s run as a broadcast service in Canada, the ''E! Ontario'' version of the service until the December 2008 discontinuation of the E! broadcast television system was available in HD over [[Hamilton, Ontario]]-based [[CHCH-TV]] (channel 11) on its channel 18 digital signal, though the majority of E!'s programming outside American primetime series before the shutdown of the [[television system]] was not available in the format.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==''E! Online''==
''E! Online'' is the online arm of E!, featuring live updates on entertainment news stories; the website includes an online-only entertainment news bulletin titled ''E! News Now'', which is updated each weekday. The website also provides live streaming video of major red carpet events including movie premieres and award shows such as the Academy Awards and the Emmys, along with some blogs involving shows such as ''The Soup''. Columnists featured on the website include [[Kristin dos Santos]] (the "Watch with Kristin" television blog), [[Ted Casablanca]] ("The Awful Truth" gossip blog), and Marc Malkin (writer of an eponymous gossip blog and host of a daily video blog on the site).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

As part of the rebrand of the cable channel on July 9, 2012, EOnline.com was redesigned for [[HTML5]], including tablet and mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostremote.com/2012/05/01/e-emphasizes-social-presence-and-tablet-friendliness-at-upfront/ E! emphasizes social presence and tablet friendliness at upfront], ''The Lost Remote'', May 1, 2012. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504054452/http://www.lostremote.com/2012/05/01/e-emphasizes-social-presence-and-tablet-friendliness-at-upfront/ |date=May 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International versions==
{{Missing information|section|other International versions|date=August 2012}}

===Australia===
{{main|E! (Australia)}}

===Canada===
Unlike most international cable channels that have licensed an American cable channel's branding and programming, E! has existed as two separate television channels in Canada – in both broadcast and pay television forms.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

On September 7, 2007, [[Canwest|Canwest Global Communications]] rebranded its CH television system as [[E! (Canadian TV system)|E!]] CH originally launched on February 12, 2001 by [[CHCH-DT|CHCH]]/[[Hamilton, Ontario]] as a secondary service of the [[Global Television Network]]; the CH/E! system would later include four additional Canwest-owned stations in [[Quebec]] ([[CJNT-DT|CJNT]]/[[Montreal]]), [[British Columbia]] ([[CHEK-DT|CHEK]]/[[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and [[CHBC-TV|CHBC]]/[[Kelowna]]) and [[Alberta]] ([[CHCA-TV|CHCA]]/[[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]]), and three affiliates owned by [[Jim Pattison Group]] in British Columbia ([[CKPG-TV|CKPG]]/[[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] and [[CFJC-TV|CFJC]]/[[Kamloops, British Columbia|Kamloops]]) and Alberta ([[CHAT-TV|CHAT]]/[[Medicine Hat, Alberta|Medicine Hat]]). The E! television system shut down on September 1, 2009 due to low ratings and corporate financial difficulties that eventually led to Canwest filing for [[bankruptcy protection]] and selling its properties to [[Shaw Media]] for $6.7 million USD; the E! [[owned-and-operated station]]s experienced varied fates (CHCH and CJNT were sold to [[Channel Zero (company)|Channel Zero]], CHEK was sold to an employee-led group; CHBC remained with Canwest and was converted into a Global O&amp;O, and CHCA ceased operations outright), while the Pattison Group stations affiliated with the [[Rogers Media]]-owned [[Citytv]] system.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; As E!, local news and other regional programming, as well as most local community sponsorships on the O&amp;O stations, used local branding (incorporating the callsign branding scheme common with Canadian stations not owned by a network or television system).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This decision was at least partly made to avoid confusion with ''E! News'', but likely intended to ensure that local newscasts were not perceived as celebrity-oriented.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The E! brand would later return to Canada on November 1, 2010, when [[CTVglobemedia]] (whose assets are now owned by [[Bell Media]]) signed a multi-year/multi-platform agreement with Comcast to rebrand [[Category A services|Category 2]] [[specialty channel]] Star! (which had a similar format to E! U.S. and had carried some of its programming prior to the 2007 rebranding of CH) into a [[E! (Canadian TV channel)|Canadian version of E!]] on November 29, 2010.

====Philippines====
E! Philippines was launched in mid-1997 over-the-air in [[Metro Manila]] on [[DWKC-TV]] (channel 31), sharing the channel with Cinema Television. In 2000, CTV-31 Manila leased DWKC's entire broadcast day, and branded the channel as E! Philippines. It was originally broadcast 24 hours a day, but eventually reduced in 2001 to a primetime 6-midnight block, before ending in 2003. Some of E!'s programs were brought to the Philippines and remade in a local version, one of which was ''Wild On! Philippines''.&lt;ref name="RMN Joint Venture For E! Philippines"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vanzi|first=Sol Jose|title=RMN Joint Venture for E!

'''''Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational Corp. v. Crooks''''', 542 F.Supp. 1156 (1982), was a [[landmark case|landmark legal case]] in the [[United States]] in which it was decided that making off-the-air copies of publicly [[broadcasting|broadcast]] [[television program]]s does not constitute [[fair use]], even if it is intended for a [[non-commercial]] and [[Charity (practice)|charitable]] purpose.

== Background ==

The [[defendant]] had made off-the-air recordings of television programs with [[education]]al content from a publicly broadcast [[television]] service. The recordings were then made available to the [[student]]s of the [[school district]].&lt;ref name="leagle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/19821698542FSupp1156_11558.xml/ENCYCLOPAEDIA%20BRITANNICA%20ED.%20CORP.%20v.%20CROOKS|title=ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA ED. CORP. v. CROOKS  &amp;#124; Leagle.com|publisher=leagle.com|accessdate=2014-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plaintiff ==

The [[plaintiff]]s were [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational Corporation]], [[Learning Corporation of America]], and [[Time-Life Films]].

== Defendant ==

The defendants were the [[Board of education|Board of Educational Services]], First Supervisory [[school district|District]], [[Erie County, New York]] [BOCES], and its individual officers and directors. BOCES was created under section 1950 of the [[New York state|New York]] Education Law for the purpose of providing educational services and specialized instruction on a cooperative basis to the 19 school districts within its geographic region. It is a [[non-profit organization]] funded by the 19 school districts.

== Decision ==

The court's decision was as follows:

On June 21, 1982, BOCES was found to be in violation of the [[law]]. On March 10, 1983, BOCES was ordered to immediately cease copying and pay the requisite damages to the plaintiff.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Academic Films for the Classroom: A History|author=Alexander, G.|date=2010|publisher=McFarland, Incorporated, Publishers|isbn=9780786460007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wLMxASznLzoC|page=194|accessdate=2014-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court determined that defendants’ highly organized and systematic practice of making off-the-air [[videotape]]s and derivative copies of plaintiffs’ televised [[copyright]]ed works did not constitute fair use under the [[copyright law]]s.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu/case/encyclopedia-britannica-educ-corp-v-crooks/|title=Encyclopedia Britannica Educ.

[[Classical rhetoric]]ians classified figures of speech into [[rhetorical operations|four categories]] or ''[[quadripartita]] ratio'':&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen, Jeroen (2008) ''[http://www.verloren.nl/boeken/2086/263/2126/renaissance/imitatio Imitatio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714140654/http://www.verloren.nl/boeken/2086/263/2126/renaissance/imitatio |date=2015-07-14 }}'' {{ISBN|978-90-8704-027-7}} [http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.jansen/page1.html Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205211147/http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.jansen/page1.html |date=2008-12-05 }} translated to English by Kristine Steenbergh. Quote from the summary: &lt;blockquote&gt;Using these formulas, a pupil could render the same subject or theme in a myriad of ways. For the mature author, this principle offered a set of tools to rework source texts into a new creation. In short, the quadripartita ratio offered the student or author a ready-made framework, whether for changing words or the transformation of entire texts. Since it concerned relatively mechanical procedures of adaptation that for the most part could be learned, the techniques concerned could be taught at school at a relatively early age, for example in the improvement of pupils’ own writing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* addition (''adiectio''), also called repetition/expansion/superabundance
* omission (''detractio''), also called subtraction/abridgement/lack
* transposition (''transmutatio''), also called transferring
* permutation (''immutatio''), also called switching/interchange/substitution/transmutation

These categories are often still used. The earliest known text listing them, though not explicitly as a system, is the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', of unknown authorship, where they are called πλεονασμός (addition), ἔνδεια (omission), μετάθεσις (transposition) and ἐναλλαγή (permutation).&lt;ref&gt;Book V, 21.29, pp.303–5&lt;/ref&gt; Quintillian then mentioned them in ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Institutio Oratoria, Vol. I, Book I, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/1B*.html Chapter 5], paragraphs 6 and 38–41. And also in Book VI [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/6C*.html Chapter 3]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philo of Alexandria]] also listed them as addition (πρόσθεσις), subtraction (ἀφαίρεσις), transposition (μετάθεσις), and transmutation (ἀλλοίωσις).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4B*.html Rhetorica ad Herennium]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Figures of speech come in many varieties. The aim is to use the language inventively to accentuate the effect of what is being said. A few examples follow:

* "Around the rugged rocks the ragged rascal ran" is an example of [[alliteration]], where the consonant ''r'' is used repeatedly.
:Whereas, "Sister Suzy sewing socks for soldiers" is a particular form of alliteration called [[sibilance]], because it repeats the letter ''s''.
:Both are commonly used in poetry.
* "She would run up the stairs and then a new set of curtains" is a variety of [[zeugma]] called a [[syllepsis]]. ''Run up'' refers to ascending and also to manufacturing. The effect is enhanced by the momentary suggestion, through a [[pun]], that she might be climbing up the curtains. The [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] or omission of the second use of the verb makes the reader think harder about what is being said.
* "Painful pride" is an [[oxymoron]] where two contradictory ideas are placed in the same sentence.
*"An Einstein" is an example of [[synecdoche]], as it uses a particular name to represent a class of people: geniuses.
* "I had butterflies in my stomach" is a [[metaphor]], referring to a nervous feeling as if there were flying insects in one's stomach.
:To say "it was like having some butterflies in my stomach" would be a [[simile]], because it uses the word ''like'' which is missing in the metaphor.
:To say "It was like having a butterfly farm in my stomach", "It felt like a butterfly farm in my stomach", or "I was so nervous that I had a butterfly farm in my stomach" could be a [[hyperbole]], because it is exaggerated.
*"That filthy place was really dirty" is an example of [[Tautology (grammar)|tautology]], as there are the two words ('filthy' and 'dirty') having almost the same meaning and are repeated so as to make the text more emphatic.

Scholars of classical Western rhetoric have divided figures of speech into two main categories: schemes and tropes. ''[[Scheme (linguistics)|Schemes]]'' (from the Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|schēma}}, 'form or shape') are figures of speech that change the ordinary or expected pattern of words. For example, the phrase, "John, my best friend" uses the scheme known as [[apposition]]. ''[[Trope (linguistics)|Tropes]]'' (from Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|trepein}}, 'to turn') change the general meaning of words. An example of a trope is irony, which is the use of words to convey the opposite of their usual meaning ("For Brutus is an honorable man; / So are they all, all honorable men").

During the [[Renaissance]], scholars meticulously enumerated and classified figures of speech. [[Henry Peacham (born 1546)|Henry Peacham]], for example, in his ''The Garden of Eloquence'' (1577), enumerated 184 different figures of speech. Professor Robert DiYanni, in his book "Literature – Reading Fiction, Poetry, Drama and the Essay"&lt;ref&gt;Second Edition, McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-557112-9}}, pp.451&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: "Rhetoricians have catalogued more than 250 different ''figures of speech'', expressions or ways of using words in a nonliteral sense."

For simplicity, this article divides the figures between schemes and tropes, but does not further sub-classify them (e.g., "Figures of Disorder"). Within each category, words are listed alphabetically. Most entries link to a page that provides greater detail and relevant examples, but a short definition is placed here for convenience. Some of those listed may be considered [[rhetorical device]]s, which are similar in many ways.

*:Examples: "not too bad" for "very good" is an understatement as well as a double negative statement that confirms a positive idea by negating the opposite. Similarly, saying "She is not a beauty queen," means "She is ugly" or saying "I am not as young as I used to be" in order to avoid saying "I am old".

* [[sibilance]]: Repetition of letter 's', it is a form of [[alliteration]]

'''Fuji''' is a popular [[Nigeria]]n musical genre. It arose from the improvisational [[Ajisari]]/[[Were music]] tradition, which is a kind of [[music]] performed to wake Muslims before dawn during the [[Ramadan]] fasting season. Were/Ajisari music itself was made popular by [[Ayinde_Barrister|Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister]].

==History==
[[Were music]]/[[Ajisari]], traditionally, was an Islamic type music played by the Muslim children in [[Yorubaland]] to wake the faithful for fasting or [[Suhur]] during [[Ramadan]] period. This musical genre was made popular by [[Alhaji Dauda Epo-Akara]], the deceased who based in [[Ibadan]],was the "awurebe" founder and Ganiyu Kuti, a.k.a. "Gani Irefin".&lt;ref&gt;W. Akpan, "And the beat goes on?", in M. Drewett and M. Cloonan, eds, ''Popular Music Censorship in Africa'' (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006), {{ISBN|0-7546-5291-2}}, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muslim community in [[Lagos]] metropolis (Lagos Mainland and Lagos Island) had a sizeable number of “Ajiwere” acts. These early performers drew great inspiration from Yoruba [[Sakara music]] style (using the [[sakara drum]] but without the violin-like goje instrument—which is normally played with an accompanying fiddle). The long list of notable Isale Eko (lower lagos city) "ajiwere" performers during the early Independence years included Sikiru (Omo Abiba), Ajadi Ganiyu, Ayinde Muniru Mayegun a.k.a. "General Captain," Ajadi Bashiru, Sikiru Onishemo, Kawu Aminu, Jibowu Barrister (under whom Alhaji Sikiru [[Ayinde Barrister]] performed), Ayinde Fatayi, Kasali Alani, Saka Olayigbade, Ayinla Yekinni, and Bashiru Abinuwaye.

Varying styles were beginning to evolve by this time, and it was not unusual for a few to play mouth organs (harmonica) between “Ajiwere” interludes within their compositions. Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister was the lead singer/composer of the popular ajisari group, Jibowu Barrister, under the leadership of Alhaji Jibowu Barrister (mentioned above). Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister and other young “Ajiwere” "rocked" [[Lagos]] and its environs.

Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister is the creator of Fuji music, one of the variations of the [[were]]/[[Ajisari]] musical genre.&lt;ref&gt;Unknown facts about Sikiru Ayinde Barrister https://www.premiumtimesng.com/arts-entertainment/117934-unknown-facts-about-sikiru-ayinde-barrister-by-olayinka-olaribigbe.html#sthash.sZUtB1FO.dpbs&lt;/ref&gt; The name, "Fuji," chosen for the new musical genre was conceived in a rather funny and unusual way. According to Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister: "I came up with it when I saw a poster at an airport, advertising the Mount Fuji, which is the highest peak in Japan." Fuji, in this context, should not be mistaken for the Yoruba word "fuja," or "faaji," which means leisure or enjoyment. "Onifuja" or "Onifaaji" is Yoruba for a socialite, or one who relishes leisure or enjoyment.

Fuji music is an offshoot of [[were]]/[[Ajisari]] musical genre. In one of his early LPs, which he used to chide the unreasonable critics who dubbed his creation "a local music," Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister explained that "Fuji music is a combination of music consisting of Sakara, Apala, [[juju]], [[Ara (musical instrument)|Aro]], [[Afro]], and [[gudugudu]], possibly [[highlife]]." Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister did a tremendous job of popularizing his craft by taking it all over the world; he started touring the European continent, especially [[United Kingdom|Britain]], since the early 1970s. Also, he first brought his trade to the [[North America]], particularly the [[United States of America]] in 1984. All these tours happened before any subsequent Fuji players ever left the shores of [[Africa]].

Between 1970 and throughout the 1980s, other fuji musicians included Fatai Adio, Saura Alhaji, Student Fuji, Rahimi Ayinde (Bokote), Ramoni Akanni, Love Azeez, Waidi Akangbe, Sikiru Olawoyin, Agbada Owo (who prematurely experimented with the guitar), Iyanda Sawaba, Ejire Shadua, Wahabi Ilori, Wasiu Ayinde Barrister (he later changed his name to [[Wasiu Ayinde Marshall]]) and also the Ibadan quatro of Suleiman Adigun, Sakaniyau Ejire, and Wasiu Ayinla emerged, all introducing their versions of Fuji music.

===Modernization===
Since the early 1980s, Alhaji Kolynton Ayinla (Baba Alatika or Kebe-n-Kwara) is a name to be reckoned with as far as fuji music is concerned. [[Wasiu Ayinde Marshall]] Barrister before he changed his name to K1 De Ultimate, has gradually emerged (with hits such as "Talazo Fuji", 1984) after tutelage under Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister. Marshall had served under Barrister in different roles such as his instrument packer and notably as his road manager. He served under Dr. Sikiru Ayinde Barrister for 15 years. Marshall's style evolved through the early 1990s as he added youthful vigour to it. By the end of the 1990s,his brand of Fuji had become one of the most popular dance genres in the country. Another artist, Adewale Ayuba, dabbled into Fuji music and took the nation by storm in the early 1990s. He managed to give off a vibe of class, though Fuji music was more popular among Yoruba Muslims, as opposed to [[Juju music]]. His brand of Fuji, termed "Bonsue Fuji", was clean,lively, and appealed to young and old alike as it was not hard to accept. Ayuba clearly did an excellent job by staying away from any feud with any other musician. He still performs till date and has many followers. Another artist that emerged in the early 1990s was Abass Akande Obesere (Omo rapala), who brought lewd street slang called "Asakasa" into the Fuji scene. He became popular with the street type and even the educated buy and hide in their cars and rooms to listen to his music.
Generally, the lyrics are in [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]. Due to its popularity with young Nigerians, Fuji is now the main hook lines of Nigerian hip-hop music.

===Continued growth===
Popular modern Fuji musicians in Nigeria include Abass Akande obesere[PK 1];[Sir)Shina Akanni, Adewale Ayuba, ;Wasiu Alabi,(Oganla 1)King Dr.Saheed Osupa [His Majesty]; Late Sunny T Adesokan (Omo Ina ton ko fuji) Alayeluwa Sulaimon Alao Adekunle Malaika(KS1, Original ), Shefiu Adekunle Alao (Omo Oko), Sule Adio (Atawéwé), Tajudeen Alabi Istijabah (Oju Kwara), Wasiu Ajani, (Mr. Pure Water), Taiye Currency, Alhaji Komi Jackson, Remi Aluko(Igwe fuji), Muri Alabi Thunder, Karube Aloma, Oyama Azeez (Arabesa | Alapatinrin) [The Modern Real Fuji Creator], Murphy Adisa Sabaika (Madiba 2), Abiodun Ike Minister (Aremo Alayeluwa), Tunde Ileiru, Karubey Shimiu, Adeolu Akanni (Paso Egba), Shamu Nokia, [[Bola Abimbola]], (Quintessential) Sunny Melody, Olusegun Ologo, and Segun Michael .

Today, fuji music has continued to attract younger generations; there are now over 10 fuji singing kids (such as Shanko Rasheed, Wasiu Container, Cripsymixtee, Konkolo Wally G, Global T, and Muri Ikoko) who are doing well in the industry. In this generation of singers, [[Wasiu Ayinde Marshall]], known as (KWAM1 or K1 De Ultimate), has been the most recognizable name in the genre since the mid- to late 1990s, and Abass Akande Obesere,in the late 1990s the trio of Wasiu Alabi Pasuma (Oganla fuji and King Saheed Osupa are dominating the scene until the  present.

The '''Grand Opera House''' is a historic [[opera house]] in [[Ashland, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=ct&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinematreasures.org|url=http://www.cinematreasures.org/theaters/41003|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was one of the first theatres in the region, and was originally a [[vaudeville]]/opera house/[[drama|live performance]] venue.

Built in 1893, it was designed by architect [[Oscar Cobb]]. It is located in a spot that was originally surrounded by hotels. The massive two-story brick building was built in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival Style]]. The auditorium is located on the second floor, which features graceful [[arch]]ed windows on the front side. The street level contains two [[retail|storefront]] spaces, with square window designs.

According to the 1893 [[Ashland Daily Press]] ''Annual Edition'', the original plan and location for this building were different. Proposed at a corner of Sixth Avenue West and Main Street West, it was built instead at the present location, in a smaller and less expensive design. This was probably due to the [[Panic of 1893|financial panic of 1893]].&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=84003619}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: West Second Street Historic District |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|author=Steve Sennott |date=February 1983 |accessdate=March 22, 2017 }} With {{NRHP url|id=84003619|photos=y|title=51 photos from 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being vacant and in need of restoration, some redevelopment has already been done, including the restoration of the front [[facade]].

The building is a [[contributing resource]] within the [[West Second Street Historic District (Ashland, Wisconsin)|West Second Street Historic District]], of downtown Ashland.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=84003619}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: West Second Street Historic District |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|author=Steve Sennott |date=February 1983 |accessdate=March 22, 2017 }} With {{NRHP url|id=84003619|photos=y|title=51 photos from 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not located directly on Second Steet (later renamed Main Street), it is still considered a contribution to the Historic District, being located close to the District, on a side street.

In later years, the building housed a [[liquor store]], and a [[gun shop]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1556">'''Guitar Rockstar''' is the European brand name for a virtual air guitar, manufactured by [[Tomy]]. It originated and continues to be sold by Tomy in [[Japan]] under the brand name "Air Guitar". Gameplay consists of holding buttons representing notes and strumming where the strings would be, in a similar fashion to air guitar. An infra-red beam passes from the end of the guitar head, and as your hand passes through the invisible infra-red beam a note is played.

Guitar Rockstar was launched in the UK with eight licensed pre-programmed rock songs:

* "[[Wild Thing (The Troggs song)|Wild Thing]]" by [[The Troggs]]

'''Japan Music Week''' ('''JMW''') was an annual international music showcase festival and convention, covering all kinds of music genres, industry sectors and regions.  
JMW first began in 2009 and was centered on the downtown music hub of [[Shibuya, Tokyo]].

== Overview ==
Japan Music Week was one of the largest [[music festival]]s in Japan, with more than 500 performers from over 40 countries playing in more than 50 [[Music venue|venue]]s over 10 days in November at as many as 200 events.

JMW attracted a strong following among local musicians and entrepreneurs, as well as bands from abroad. Its focus on emerging talent earned the festival a burgeoning reputation as a breeding ground for music networking in the region.

==History==

Lynch formed JMW in November 2009 after being sent to American music-industry showcase [[South by Southwest]] (SXSW) to make a documentary for Space Shower TV, and developed the idea to start his own festival. "SXSW is a weeklong festival and I think at that time they had about 3,000 artists playing," says Lynch. "[[Austin]] is a much smaller city than Tokyo, even though it's kind of set up for conventions, so it just struck me that [[Tokyo]], and [[Shibuya]] in particular, would be very suitable for hosting that kind of event.&lt;ref name="Japan Music Week sets lofty goals"&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20101105a1.html], ''[[The Japan Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;". As founder of the free music-listings magazine Juice and its sister magazine Club Juice, Lynch used his contacts to persuade club owners to adhere to a wristband providing free or discounted access to a number of themed events occurring in live venues around the city.

===2009-2011===
Japan Music Week kicked off with a big networking party at the well-known Shibuya club, O-East,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virtualjapan.com/wiki/Shibuya_O-East/&lt;/ref&gt; on November 9, 2009. It was accompanied by panel discussions and seminars, and immediately followed by “Best of Japan,” a concert that aimed to showcase Japan-based artists, such as Kinlay Band and [[Kev Gray &amp; The Gravy Train]].&lt;ref name="metropolis.co.jp"&gt;http://metropolis.co.jp/arts/japan-beat/kansai-music-conference-japan-music-week//&lt;/ref&gt; Bands from abroad included the popular [[New Zealand]] rap-fusion outfit, [[Nesian Mystic]]. However, a lack of funding and the mixed reviews of 2009, saw serious organizational problems for 2010.&lt;ref name="japanmusicweekartists.ning.com"&gt;http://japanmusicweekartists.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20101105a1.html] ''[[The Japan Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism &amp; Sponsorship===

Comments on the JMW-related forums criticized the event for its lack of organization and overkill of events, with music ranging from [[Afghanistan]] Night to [[Hong Kong]] Night, which some musicians felt was clogging up the schedule with empty events for the sake of diversity. The finite number of guests and venues also meant audience figures was split too thinly with some clubs allegedly complaining of low turnouts.&lt;ref name="japanmusicweekartists.ning.com"/&gt;

Lynch, together with Tokyo-based events organizer, Jhoana Mendieta, secured sponsorship from Marlboro for the 2011 event, which enabled substantial funding for artists that offer free downloads and set up events.&lt;ref name="japanmusicweek.com"&gt;http://www.japanmusicweek.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch has stated, “We aim to provide a showcase for emerging artists, and to stimulate the local and international music industry to find strong new directions in the face of its many challenges.”.&lt;ref name="metropolis.co.jp"/&gt; He clearly stands by his vision, "I believe next year we could have 100 or 200 cities in Japan Music Week."&lt;ref&gt;http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20101105a1.html], ''[[The Japan Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar festivals==
Similar festivals elsewhere include the [[Kansai Music Conference]] in [[Osaka]], [[Popkomm]] in [[Berlin]], [[North by Northeast]] (NXNE) in [[Toronto]], North by Northwest (NXNW) in [[Portland, Oregon]] and West by Southwest (WXSW) in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. On an international scale there is the [[Fête de la Musique]], also known as [[World Music Day]], a music festival taking place around the world on June 21.

==Synopsis==
Saif Salaam (Imam Syed)  travels from Mailsi, Multan to train with Pakistan's best boxing coach, Ghulam Bashir(Faraz Lodhi), who owned the Ghulam Bashir Boxing club in Lyari. But there was one catch: Bashir had not coached anyone in the last 2 decades since he had a falling out with his best buddy Daud Islam (Adnan Jaffar) who now runs the local mafia that controls drugs, prostitution, and betting houses in one of the most troubled parts of the city.

As Saif learns how to spar, he realizes that his decision to train for a professional boxing career has sparked tension between the age old rivals, put the livelihood of thousands in the area at risk, and exposed his family to grave danger.

'''Lew Grade, Baron Grade''', [[Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)|OStJ]], [[Order of St. Sylvester|KC*SS]] (25 December 1906&amp;nbsp;– 13 December 1998), born '''Louis Winogradsky''',&lt;ref&gt;Horace Newcomb, ''Encyclopedia of Television''&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[media proprietor]] and [[impresario]].

Originally a [[dancer]], and later a [[talent agent]], Grade's interest in television production began in 1954 when, in partnership, he successfully bid for [[Franchising|franchises]] in the newly created [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, which led to the creation of [[Associated Television]] (ATV). Having worked for a time in the United States, he was aware of the potential for the sale of television programming to American networks, and a subsidiary, the [[ITC Entertainment|Incorporated Television Company]] (ITC; commonly known as ITC Entertainment) was formed with this specific objective in mind. Grade had some success in this field with such series as [[Gerry Anderson]]'s various [[Supermarionation]] series such as ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', [[Patrick McGoohan]]'s ''[[The Prisoner]]'', and [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. Later, Grade invested in film production, but several expensive [[Box office bomb|box office failures]] caused him to lose control of ITC, and ultimately resulted in the disestablishment of ATV after it lost its ITV franchise.&lt;ref name="Economist_obit"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Economist]]|date=17 December 1998|title=Lord Grade of Elstree, showman, died on December 13th, aged 91|accessdate=31 December 2013|url=http://www.economist.com/node/180361|quote=[H]e felt betrayed when in 1982 he lost control of Associated Communications Corporation, the parent company of his television and other interests, to [[Robert Holmes à Court]], an Australian. Lord Grade had felt so close to the Australian that he allowed him to buy 51% of the voting shares. Holmes à Court then deposed him in a boardroom coup and purged the company of all his staff, even, Lord Grade noted sadly, his tea lady. Later, he observed waspishly, "Robert died quite a young man, for all his millions".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Grade was born in [[Tokmak, Ukraine|Tokmak]], [[Taurida Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] to Isaak and Olga Winogradsky.&lt;ref name="Hoge"/&gt; In 1912, when Grade was five years old, the Jewish family emigrated to escape [[Cossack]] violence and [[anti-Semitism]], from [[Odessa]] via [[Berlin]] to [[Brick Lane]] in [[Bethnal Green]] in the [[East End of London|East End]] of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The East End: Four Centuries of London Life|authorlink=Alan Warwick Palmer|first=Alan Warwick|last=Palmer|page=106|origyear=1989|year=2000|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|location=[[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]|isbn=0813528267|accessdate=31 December 2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VH94S39CRFYC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=lew+grade+Rochelle+Street+Elementary+School&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0iItut2z7c&amp;sig=LTCvM-aQMCEMyRDYWle4zX2jLHY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JnjDUpvHIMjNsASt3ICIDw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=lew%20grade%20Rochelle%20Street%20Elementary%20School&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaak worked as a [[Trouser press|trouser-presser]] while his three sons (Grade and his younger brothers, Bernard (later [[Bernard Delfont]]) and [[Leslie Grade|Leslie]]) attended the Rochelle Street Elementary School near [[Shoreditch]], where [[Yiddish]] was spoken by 90% of the pupils. For two years the Winogradskys lived in rented rooms at the north end of [[Brick Lane]], before moving to the nearby [[Boundary Estate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22752 ''Bethnal Green: Building and Social Conditions from 1876 to 1914: a History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11'': Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 126–32; retrieved 14 November 2006.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early professional life===
At the age of 15, Grade became an agent for a clothing company, and shortly afterwards started his own business. In 1926, he was declared [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] Champion of the World at a dancing competition at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].&lt;ref name="Hoge"/&gt;  [[Fred Astaire]] was one of the judges.&lt;ref name="Economist_obit"/&gt; Grade subsequently became a professional dancer going by the name Louis Grad; he changed this name to Lew Grade, which came from a Paris reporter's typing error that Grade liked and decided to keep.&lt;ref name="TH"&gt;[http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/lewgrade.htm Television Greats: Lew Grade], Television Heaven entry.&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, the then  octogenarian Lord Grade once danced the Charleston at a party [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger]] gave in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|title=CHRONICLE|first=Nadine|last=Brozan|date=22 May 1992|accessdate=31 December 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/22/style/chronicle-921792.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signed as a dancer by Joe Collins (father of [[Jackie Collins|Jackie]] and [[Joan Collins]]) in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1988/04/02/page/8/article/joe-collins-dynasty-stars-father/|title=Joe Collins, ''Dynasty'' Star's Father|work=Chicago Tribune|date=12 April 1988|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 1934, Grade went into partnership with him and became a [[talent agent]] in their company Collins &amp; Grade. Among their earliest clients were the harmonica player [[Larry Adler]] and the jazz group [[Quintette du Hot Club de France|Quintet of the Hot Club of France]].&lt;ref name=Faith&gt;{{cite news|first=Nicholas|last=Faith|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-lord-grade-1191347.html|title=Obituary: Lord Grade|work=[[The Independent]]|date=14 December 1998|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the beginning of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, Grade became involved in arranging entertainment for soldiers in [[Harrogate]],&lt;ref name="TH"/&gt; and later joined the [[British Army]]. He was discharged after two years when an old problem with [[Knee effusion|swelling of the knees]], which had earlier ended his dancing career, recurred.&lt;ref name=Faith/&gt; In 1945, the arrangement with Collins having been terminated, Grade formed a partnership with his brother Leslie (Lew and Leslie Grade Ltd., or the Grade Organisation). That year, the brothers travelled in the United States, where they developed their entertainment interests. His connections included, among others, [[Bob Hope]] and [[Judy Garland]], who performed in Britain for the first time.&lt;ref name=Faith/&gt; The brothers became the main bookers of artists for the [[London Palladium]] in 1948, then managed by [[Val Parnell]] for the [[Moss Empires|Moss Empires Group]] owned by the family of [[Prince Littler]].&lt;ref name="Angelini"/&gt;

==Media career==

===Television: 1954–62===
In 1954, Grade was contacted by the manager of singer [[Jo Stafford]], Mike Nidorf,&lt;ref name="Ellis1"&gt;Carl Ellis: [http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/tvheroes/lewgrade/index3.php Lew Grade, Part 3: the War and After] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905211110/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/tvheroes/lewgrade/index3.php |date=5 September 2008 }}, TV Heroes, Transdiffusion.&lt;/ref&gt; who notified him of an advertisement in ''[[The Times]]'' inviting franchise bids for the new, commercial [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network.

Assembling a consortium that included impresarios Val Parnell and Prince Littler, the Incorporated Television Programme Company (ITP), which soon changed its name to [[ITC Entertainment|Incorporated Television Company]] (ITC; also known as ITC Entertainment), was formed. ITC's bid to the [[Independent Television Authority]] (ITA) was rejected on the grounds of its conflict of interest from its prominence and involvement in artist management.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The Associated Broadcasting Development Company (ABD) had gained ITA approval for both the London weekend and [[English Midlands|Midlands]] weekday contracts, but was undercapitalised; Grade's consortium joined with the ABD to form what became [[Associated Television]] (ATV). Reflecting his background in variety, Grade's favourite show&lt;ref name="Palmer112"&gt;Michael Palmer and Jeremy Tunstal [https://books.google.com/books?id=XliIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112 ''Media Moguls''], Routledge, 1991, p. 112&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and a success for the new company was ''[[Sunday Night at the London Palladium]]'' (1955–67, 1973–74), one of the most popular programmes on British television in its day. Grade did not avoid the other end of the cultural spectrum, and from 1958 [[Kenneth Clark|Sir Kenneth Clark]]&lt;!-- Not a peer until 1969. --&gt; began to talk about the history of art on television.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bignell ""And the Rest is History: Lew Grade, Creation Narratives and Television Historiography", in Catherine Johnson and Rob Turnock (eds.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=vbLlAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60 ''Itv Cultures: Independent Television Over Fifty Years''], Maidenhead: Open University Press, 2005, p. 50&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Grade committed the funds for what would become the first trans-Atlantic success of the ITP subsidiary: ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1955–60), commissioned by UK-based American producer [[Hannah Weinstein]]. ITC became a wholly owned ATV subsidiary in 1957,&lt;ref name="AngeliniITC"&gt;Sergio Angelini: [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/563524/index.html ITC], BFI screenonline.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year ATV established a music publishing division with [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing|ATV Music]] and gained a half interest in [[Pye Records]] in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;Louis Barfe [https://books.google.com/books?id=AhLwEqh8xlkC&amp;pg=PT134 ''Where Have All the Good Times Gone? The Rise and Fall of the Record Industry''], London: Atlantic Books, 2005, p. 134&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; later Pye became a wholly owned subsidiary.

===Television: 1962–68===
Grade was deputy managing director of ATV under Val Parnell until 1962, when he became managing director having contrived to have the board oust Parnell.&lt;ref name="Angelini"&gt;Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/482705/index.html "Grade, Lord Lew (1906–1998)"], BFI Screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; Grade soon decided that the Midlands deserved its own regular soap opera as a rival to ''[[Coronation Street]]''. ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'', much derided but ultimately a serious challenge to Granada's series in the ratings, began its initial quarter century run in November 1964.&lt;ref&gt;John Williams [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1357782/index.html "''Crossroads'' - The 1960s"], BFI Screenonline&lt;/ref&gt;

ITC's success continued and had many internationally successful TV series, leading [[Howard Thomas]], managing director of the [[Associated British Corporation]] (ABC), to complain that Grade distributed programming for "[[Birmingham, Alabama]], rather than [[Birmingham]], England".&lt;ref name="Ellis2"&gt;Carl Ellis [http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/tvheroes/lewgrade/index4.php Lew Grade, Part 4: Embracing the 1950s] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728124700/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/tvheroes/lewgrade/index4.php |date=28 July 2011 }}, TV Heroes, Transdiffusion.&lt;/ref&gt; These series included ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'' (1962–69), which was sold to over 80 countries,&lt;ref name="Chapman"&gt;James Chapman [https://books.google.com/books?id=rW7nJMJ-WloC&amp;pg=PA100 ''Saints and Avengers: British Adventure Series of the 1960s''], London: I.B Tauris, 2002, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; and two featuring [[Patrick McGoohan]]: ''[[Danger Man]]'' (1960–68) and ''[[The Prisoner]]'' (1967–68). These series, exclusively thrillers, were normally used as summer replacements for American-made programmes until the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Hood [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/25th-november-1966/12/export-backlash "Export Backlash"], ''The Spectator'', 25 November 1966, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  While many of Grade's series used American actors in lead roles (''[[The Baron]]'' and ''[[Man in a Suitcase]]'', for example) it was those series which used an exclusively British cast, such as ''The Saint'' (and ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', made by another ITV contractor), which were more successful in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, ''Saints and Avengers'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, [[AP Films]] became a subsidiary of ITC. Co-founded by [[Gerry Anderson]], AP Films produced the children's marionette puppet ("[[Supermarionation]]") series during the 1960s, ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' (1965–66), and (as Century 21), ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'' (1967–68). After a screening of the pilot for ''Thunderbirds'' ("[[Trapped in the Sky]]", 1964), Grade insisted that the episodes be lengthened to fill a one-hour slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Thunderbirds |url=http://www.classictv.info/show/trivia.asp?show=21 |accessdate=12 April 2017|publisher=Classic TV Info |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually for [[children's television series]], these [[Color television|colour]] programmes were generously budgeted for the time (Grade paid £22,000 per episode), and has been successfully repeated internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilhooly |first=Rob |title=Still F.A.B. after all these years |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2001/12/26/arts/still-f-a-b-after-all-these-years/#.WO67dlPyutg |accessdate=12 April 2017|publisher=The Japan Times |date= 26 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 1966, Grade's companies were re-organised again to form the [[Associated Communications Corporation]] (ACC). That year, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' investigated the interconnected nature of the companies controlled by Grade and his two brothers, Bernard Delfont and Leslie Grade. Their firms, effectively amounting to a "cartel", were agents for most of the major talents in acting as well as entertainment and controlled theatres in both London and the rest of the UK and ATV was a major provider of televised entertainment.&lt;ref name="Palmer112"/&gt;

===Later television productions===
The following year, ATV lost its London franchise to what would become [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT);&lt;ref name="Elen"&gt;Richard G. Elen; [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/459509/index.html ATV], BFI screenonline.&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time, however, ATV's Midlands franchise was expanded to run throughout the week from July 1968. Through ATV Music, Grade acquired [[Northern Songs]], gaining control of the [[Lennon–McCartney]] song catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Norman [https://books.google.com/books?id=l2I0twz__BIC&amp;pg=PA422&amp;lpg=PA422 ''Shout!: The Beatles in Their Generation''],  New York: Fireside, 2005, pp. 422-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign sales remained strong for a time (valued at $30&amp;nbsp;million in 1970)&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905454,00.html Entrepreneurs: Top Grade], ''TIME'', 4 October 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ACC received the [[Queen's Awards for Enterprise|Queen's Awards for Export]] in both 1967 and 1969.

Some of the 1970s distributions performed poorly: these included ''[[The Julie Andrews Hour]]'' (1972–1973), which aired for only one season on the [[ABC Television Network]] in the United States. This received positive reviews and seven [[Emmy Award]]s, including the title Best Variety Series. Neither ''[[The Protectors]]'' (1972–74) and ''[[The Persuaders!]]'' (1971–72),&lt;ref name="AngeliniITC"/&gt; both action shows, were particularly successful. Anderson moved to [[live action]] [[British television science fiction|science fiction]] shows ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' (1969–71) and ''[[Space: 1999]]'' (1975–77). After ''Space: 1999'', Gerry Anderson made no new series for ITC, but maintained a connection with Grade until Grade lost control of his companies in 1982.

In the mid-1970s Grade approached American puppeteer [[Jim Henson]], who was in need of assistance for his latest TV project. Henson wanted to create a new variety show starring his [[The Muppets|Muppet]] characters, but had been dismissed by American networks on account of his contributions to children's programmes such as ''[[Sesame Street]]'' (from 1969).{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} [[CBS]] came close to agreeing to broadcast ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', but only if it was during a [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated block]] of its programming.{{huh|date=June 2018}} After watching one of Henson's pilots and recalling a special made in one of his studios Grade allowed Henson to realise his project in Britain (the series was recorded at ATV's [[Elstree Studios#Clarendon Road Studios, Borehamwood|Elstree Studios]]) and distributed internationally by ITC. Grade's action was instrumental in bringing ''The Muppet Show'' to the screen in 1976 and ensuring its success.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Grade's other accomplishments in TV included the mini-series ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (film)|Jesus of Nazareth]]'' (1977), which was successfully sold to the American market and secured a record-breaking $12&amp;nbsp;million in revenue. Several years in preparation, the deal with the Italian broadcaster [[RAI]] and director [[Franco Zeffirelli]] was announced in August 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sullivan [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/24th-august-1974/15/religion " A television Jesus"], ''The Spectator'', 23 August 1974, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Grade approached [[Blake Edwards]] to revive the Pink Panther franchise as a TV series, an option Edwards was not keen on,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/8207853/Blake-Edwards.html Obituary: Blake Edwards], telegraph.co.uk, 16 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but he did work on developing scripts. Eventually, he persuaded Grade to finance the property as a feature film project with he and [[Peter Sellers]] waiving their fees in return for a profit-sharing arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Upton [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gb5ci9IF_SMC&amp;pg=RA1-PT28 ''Fallen Stars: Tragic Lives and Lost Careers''], Manchester, Headpress, 2004, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; Both men's careers had not been prospering for a few years.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Thomas [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19751117&amp;id=BQ9PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QgIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7275,4848771 "Pink Panther Sequel Spelled Success"], ''The Blade'' (Toledo, Ohio), 17 November 1975, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Only Grade's second big budget feature,&lt;ref name="Angelini"/&gt; ITC produced the eventual film ''[[The Return of the Pink Panther]]'' (1975), while [[United Artists]] (UA), who had earlier rejected the project themselves, gained distribution rights and a 5% share of the profits.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lewis [https://books.google.com/books?id=biKazcH-dXoC&amp;pg=PA845 ''The Life and Death of Peter Sellers''], London: Arrow Books, 2004 [1994], p. 845n.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution in other countries was undertaken by ITC. ''The Return of the Pink Panther'' was a commercially successful release.&lt;ref name="Angelini"/&gt;

It also prompted Grade to move into the film industry, where he had success with ''[[Farewell, My Lovely (1975 film)|Farewell My Lovely]]'' (1975).&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Lew Grade the new knight in shining armour for British films", ''The Irish Times'', Dublin, Ireland, 27 October 1975, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Other films of the period made with Grade's involvement include the co-releases ''[[The Boys from Brazil (film)|The Boys From Brazil]]'' (1978) with [[20th Century Fox]] and ''[[Movie Movie]]'' (also 1978) with [[Warner Brothers]]. He was a producer on the [[Ingmar Bergman]] films ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'' (1978) and ''[[From the Life of the Marionettes]]'' (1980). Grade was executive producer of ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'' (1981); [[Orson Welles]] portrayed a studio executive named "Lew Lord" in the first film. One domestic British film made by the ITC subsidiary Black Lion Films, ''[[The Long Good Friday]]'' (1980) was purchased and released by [[HandMade Films]] after Grade and his company had effectively disowned it for, in Grade's reputed opinion, seeming to be sympathetic to the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]].&lt;ref name="Duguid"&gt;Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/480130/index.html "''Long Good Friday, The'' (1979)"], BFI Screenonline; accessed 24 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grade's backing of an expensive "all-star" flop was to prove decisive. Of ''[[Raise the Titanic (film)|Raise the Titanic]]'' (1980), an adaptation of [[Raise the Titanic!|the novel]] by [[Clive Cussler]], Grade himself observed that "It would have been cheaper to lower the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]".&lt;ref name="Hoge"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoge|first=Warren|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/14/nyregion/lew-grade-91-flamboyant-shaper-of-british-tv-and-movies.html|title=Lew Grade, 91, Flamboyant Shaper of British TV and Movies|work=The New York Times|date=14 December 1998|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AngeliniITC"/&gt; The film was panned by critics and, after costing $36 million, returned only $8 million in rentals.&lt;ref name="Raines"&gt;Howell Raines [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/17/arts/lew-grade-at-81-retains-his-zest-for-a-deal.html "Lew Grade, at 81, Retains His Zest for a Deal"], ''New York Times'', 17 April 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; This and other expensive box office failures – including ''[[Saturn 3]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Legend of the Lone Ranger]]'' (1981) – marked the end of Grade's involvement in major film production.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Despite this, several of the most critically acclaimed films produced by Grade were released after the failure of ''Raise the Titanic'': these included ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'' (1981) and ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (1982), both winners of [[Academy Award]]s, as well as ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'' (1982), which was Jim Henson's final project created in association with ITC.

===Later years===
In 1980, Grade's standing in the mass media industry was damaged by three events: Henson's decision to end ''The Muppet Show'' after five years, the poor reception to ''Raise the Titanic'', and a decision that, effective from 1 January 1982, [[ATV Midlands]] would be permitted to keep its licence only on the condition that it terminate its association with Grade and ITC (ultimately leading to its re-branding as [[ITV Central|Central Television]]). Grade resigned his position in the company while it underwent a series of partnerships and mergers. In 1982, he lost control of ACC to [[Robert Holmes à Court]], who dismissed him and all his staff.&lt;ref name="Economist_obit"/&gt;

Grade was brought in by American producer [[Norman Lear]] in June 1982 to head the London division of [[Embassy Pictures|Embassy Communications International]] involved in the production and distribution of films and television programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cuff|first=Daniel F.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/24/business/business-people-lord-grade-joins-norman-lear-team.html|title=Lord Grade Joins Norman Lear Team|work=The New York Times|date=24 June 1982|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently he became a producer of [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s musical ''[[Starlight Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennetts|first=Leslie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/23/theater/a-transformed-starlight-express-strives-toward-broadway-opening.html|title=A Transformed ''Starlight Express'' Strives Towards Broadway Opening|work=The New York Times|date=23 February 1987|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]] had bought Embassy, he became the head of a new venture, the Grade Company in 1985, and was elected a vice-president of the [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loews Group]] chain of cinemas in the United States.&lt;ref name="Hoge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/54/Lew-Grade.html|title=Lew Grade Biography (1906-1998)|work=Film Reference|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grade Company produced adaptations for television of works by novelist Dame [[Barbara Cartland]]; he owned the rights to 450 of her romances.&lt;ref name="Raines"/&gt;

By the mid-1990s, Grade had returned to ITC to head the company one final time until his death in 1998. Grade was a member of the Founding Council of the [[Rothermere American Institute]] at the [[University of Oxford]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Honours==
[[Knight Bachelor|Knighted]] in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=44790|date=14 February 1969 |page=1705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grade was created a [[life peer]] — '''Baron Grade''', of [[Elstree]] in the County of Hertfordshire on 22 June 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=46943|date=24 June 1976|page=8773}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chose Elstree as his [[territorial designation]] because ATV's main studios were based there.

==Death==
Grade died of heart failure, 12 days short of his 92nd birthday, on 13 December 1998 in London. To celebrate Grade's life and mark the centenary of his birth, [[BBC Radio 2]] transmitted two special one-hour tribute programmes on 24 and 25 December 2006.

[[Image:1902 Conference.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|Ukrainian lirnyk with kobzari, Kharkiv, 1902.]]
[[Image:Kharkiv kobzari.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|Ukrainian lirnyk with kobzari, Okhtyrka, 1911.]]

The '''lirnyk''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: лірник; plural лірники - lirnyky) were itinerant [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] musicians who performed religious, historical and epic songs to the accompaniment of a [[Lira (instrument)|lira]], the Ukrainian version of the hurdy-gurdy.

Lirnyky were similar to and belonged to the same guilds as the better known [[bandura]] players known as [[kobzar]]s. However, the lirnyk played the lira, a kind of crank-driven [[hurdy-gurdy]], while the kobzars played the lute-like [[bandura]]s. Lirnyky were usually blind or had some major disability. They were active in all areas of Ukraine from (at least) the 17th century on. 

The tradition was discontinued in Eastern/Central Ukraine in the mid-1930s, some lirnyky were seen in the regions of Western Ukraine until the 1970s and even the 1980s. 

Today, the repertoire of the instrument is mostly performed by educated, sighted performers. Notable performers of the lira include [[Mykhailo Khai]], Vadim ([[Yarema]]) Shevchuk, and [[Volodymyr Kushpet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2309">The term "'''Marcinelle school'''" ({{lang-fr|École de Marcinelle}}) or "'''Charleroi school'''" (''École de Charleroi'') refers to a group of [[Franco-Belgian comics|Belgian cartoonists]] formed by Joseph Gillain (known as [[Jijé]]) following [[World War II]]. ("Bande à quatre", "Gang of four", also consisting of [[Franquin]], [[Morris (comics)|Morris]] and [[Will (comics)|Will]].) Marcinelle school cartoonists were all associated with the weekly magazine, ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'', whose offices in the 1940s were located in the town of [[Marcinelle]], near [[Charleroi]] in [[Belgium]].

The style of these cartoonists soon became the preferred in-house style for artists working at the influential ''Spirou'' magazine, and thus had a huge impact on the Franco-Belgian comics scene, inspiring generations of cartoonists. 

==Style==

Stylistically, the Marcinelle school is a mix of cartoonish and realist, and is also sometimes called ''comic-dynamic'' ("comic" here refers to "comical", not the medium). It is often cited in books in opposition to [[Hergé]]'s ''[[ligne claire]]'' style.  Though these two styles have much in common, Marcinelle school is all about conveying the impression of [[Motion (physics)|movement]], while ''ligne claire'' tends to be more [[schematic]].

[[Image:Image-Marcinelle-Example.png|frame|center|Typical vivid movement of [[Spirou (character)|Spirou]] and [[Marsupilami]] from [[André Franquin]]'s comic [[Spirou et Fantasio]].]]

==List of artists==

The artists most closely associated to the Marcinelle school are:
*[[Jijé|Joseph Gillain]] (Jijé)
*[[André Franquin]]
*[[Morris (comics)|Maurice de Bevere]] (Morris)
*[[Will (comics)|Willy Maltaite]] (Will)
*[[Eddy Paape]]
*[[Peyo|Pierre Culliford]] (Peyo)
*[[Jean Roba]]
*[[Victor Hubinon]]

Other artists considered part of the School include:

'''''Memoirs of the Actor in a Supporting Role''''' ({{lang-fa|خاطرات هنرپیشهٔ نقش دوم|translit=khaterat-e honarpishe-ye naqsh-e dovvom}}) is a 1982 play by [[Bahram Beyzai]].

== Plot ==
The play recounts the urban adventures of two male villagers (named Mowhebat and Zolfaqar) in Tehran during the earlier stages of street demonstrations in the 1979 revolution. Driven by drought and indigence, the two arrive in the large city in the latter months of the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|shah]]'s rule in order to seek employment. They end up as hirelings in large crowds of mercenary vagabonds demonstrating against revolutionaries. Each day they dress up as workers, party members, students, parents of demonstrating students protesting against their own rebellious children, etc. Their unwittingly reactionary occupation in troubled times adds up to catastrophic consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Beyzai, Bahram.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5312">'''Music of the Czech Republic''' comprises the musical traditions of [[Czech Republic|that state]] or the historical entities of which it is compound, i.e. the [[Czech lands]] ([[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Czech Silesia]]). Czech music also constitutes a substantial part of the music culture of its direct predecessor, [[Czechoslovakia]].

Music in this area has its roots in sacred music from more than a thousand years ago. The oldest recorded song from this territory is the hymn ''[[Hospodine, pomiluj ny]]'' ("Lord, Have Mercy on Us"), dating from the turn of the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AajbWrhXlDcC|title=Anne's Bohemia: Czech Literature and Society, 1310-1420|last=Thomas|first=Alfred|date=1998-01-01|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816630547|page=25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional music==
Bohemian traditional music includes that of [[Chodsko]] &lt;small&gt;([[:cs:Chodsko|CS]])&lt;/small&gt;, where [[bagpipes]] are common. [[Moravian traditional music]] is known for the [[cimbalom]], which is played in ensembles that also include [[double bass]], [[clarinet]] and [[violin]]s. The traditional music of Moravia displays regional influences, especially in [[Wallachia|Valachia]] with a Romanian and Ukrainian legacy, and has close cultural relations with Slovakia and Lachia (the borderland of northern Moravia and [[Czech Silesia]]) with its Polish aspects.

A famous dance from the region is the Bohemian [[polka]].
[[file:Britva.ogg|right|thumb|Ukázka z řemeslnického tance Břitva, traditional Czech Folk Song.]]

==Bohemian music==
Early evidence of music from this region is documented in manuscripts from the library of the [[Cistercian]] monastery in [[Vyšší Brod]] (founded in 1259). One of the most important is manuscript No. 42, from 1410. It contains a hymn called ''Jezu Kriste, ščedrý kněže'' ("Jesus Christ Bountiful Prince"), that people would sing during the preaching of [[John Huss]].

With the development of towns in the 15th century, music started to play an important role in two Bohemian centers: [[Prachatice]] and [[Sušice]]. [[Václav z Prachatic]] (Václav of Prachatice) dealt with the theory of music at the [[Charles University in Prague]]. His manuscript ''{{Lang|la|Musica magistrii Johannis de Muris accurtata de musica Boethii}}'' is a collective work on the theory of music inspired by the thoughts of Johan de Muris, who worked in Paris, and is in the university library.

Extensive musical activities in Prachatice took place in the second half of the 16th century during the [[Renaissance]], a notable period of ''literátská bratrstva'' ("men of letters brotherhoods"). Their main focus was community singing performed during ceremonial services. The brotherhood established its memorial book in 1575, which described its activities until 1949, when the brotherhood perished. The Habsburg [[Counter-Reformation]] in Bohemia after 1620 also affected music in the region. Catholic priests performed Gregorian chorals, while the people sang spiritual songs often based on the Protestant tradition. This ended in a new Catholic edition of hymn books such as ''Capella regia musicalis''.

The Czech classicism period is exemplified by [[František Xaver Brixi]], [[Johann Baptist Wanhal]], and Augustin Šenkýř. Among the 18th and 19th century composers are [[Vincenc Mašek]] &lt;small&gt;([[:cs:Vincenc Mašek|CS]])&lt;/small&gt;, [[Jan Jakub Ryba]], [[Jan August Vitásek]]. In the 19th century German and Austrian productions also had their place here. The founder of Czech national music [[Bedřich Smetana]] was inspired by the Bohemian Forest while creating his symphonic poem ''[[Má vlast#Vltava|Vltava]]''. [[Antonín Dvořák]] was also inspired by the Bohemian Forest in his piece called ''Klid pro violoncello a orchestr''.

The traditional music of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] influenced the work of composers like [[Leoš Janáček]], Antonín Dvořák, Bedřich Smetana, and [[Bohuslav Martinů]]. Earlier composers from the region include [[Adam Michna]], [[Heinrich Biber]], [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]], [[Johann Stamitz|Johann Wenzel Stamitz]] and [[Johann Ladislaus Dussek]].

'''Music on hold''' ('''MOH''') is the business practice of playing recorded [[music]] to fill the silence that would be heard by [[telephone]] callers who have been placed [[Hold (telephone)|on hold]].  It is especially common in situations involving [[customer service]].

Music on hold is sometimes referred to as phone on hold, message on hold, on hold messaging, or hold music.

==Development==
Music on hold was created by Alfred Levy, an inventor, factory owner, and entrepreneur. In 1962, Levy discovered a problem with the phone lines at his factory. He discovered that a loose wire was touching a metal girder on the building. This made the building a giant receiver so that the audio broadcast signal from a radio station next door would transmit through the loose wire and could be heard when calls were put on hold.&lt;ref&gt;Article{{cite web|url=http://callsonhold.com/recognition.htm|title=Smithsonian recognizes Music on Hold. |publisher=CallsonHold.com |date=2005-01-01 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levy patented his work in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=PZ9lAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Google Patent for Telephone Hold Program System  |publisher=google.com/patents |date=2013-07-06 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other advancements have come to change and enhance the technology, it was this initial patent creation that began the evolution for today's music on hold.

==Equipment and formats==
Most MOH systems are integrated into a telephone system designed for businesses via an [[jack (connector)|audio jack]] on the [[telephone]] equipment labeled "MOH". There are also some units with built-in message on hold capabilities and units designed for small businesses without an extensive phone system.

Today, equipment that supports physical media usually plays [[Compact disk|CDs]]. Some older systems may still use [[Compact audio cassette|cassette tapes]] (sometimes employing endless-loops), or [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] tape players. In each case, the unit loads the media into a digital memory chip to prevent premature wearing of the mechanical parts.

Equipment that supports virtual media generally plays [[MP3]] files. Several types of units play these files. [[USB Flash Drive]] units allow an MP3 file to be received electronically, downloaded to a flash drive and connected to the player. Ethernet based remote load units connect via the network to a remote IP address. Phone line based remote load systems allow for a connection via an analog telephone line and dialing the number belonging to the unit.  For [[Voice over internet protocol|VoIP]] phone systems, MP3s are loaded without any equipment.

Newer technology allows MP3 files to be downloaded automatically from the internet so that messages (or interesting content in the form of news and weather, amongst many) can be changed daily. The new "online on hold" technology makes the older technology redundant since it requires no additional hardware.  All these systems allow analog-to-digital audio storage and playback.

As of 2011 allow productions to be downloaded via the Internet or played through a USB flash drive. This allows for larger files and higher quality formats. Grace Digital manufactures internet radio devices that play streaming content (see Recent Trends, below).

==Consumer perceptions==
A number of studies have been conducted, which highlight consumer perceptions of music on hold, reinforcing its use by businesses to improve standards of call handling.

A survey of more than 2,000 UK consumers commissioned by audio branding specialist [[PHMG (company)]] revealed 70% of consumers are put on hold for more than 50% of their calls. When put on hold, 73% of callers want to hear something other than beeps or silence.&lt;ref&gt;Article{{cite web|url=http://www.freshbusinessthinking.com/news.php?NID=14476&amp;Title=Seventy+per+cent+of+consumers+put+on+hold+for+longer+than+a+minute |title=Seventy per cent of consumers put on hold for longer than a minute |publisher=freshbusinessthinking.com |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article{{cite web|url=http://www.smallbusiness.co.uk/channels/sales-and-marketing/news/2110543/customers-perennially-on-hold.thtml |title=Customers perennially on hold |publisher=smallbusiness.co.uk |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CNN survey found that 70 percent of callers in the United States who hold the line in silence hang up within 60 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://work.chron.com/importance-onhold-messages-4665.html |title=The Importance of On-Hold Messages |author=Anna Assad |publisher=Houston Chronicle |accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, research by North American Telecom found callers hearing music on hold will stay on the line 30 seconds longer than callers experiencing silence.

==Source of music==

===Radio===
The musical source may be as simple as playing a local [[radio station]] through the MOH jack.  This is unlawful without the express permission of the music title and mechanical copyright holders.
* Although radio stations may provide the desired [[List of music radio formats|musical format]], there is no control over the specific songs that are played, some of which may be offensive to the callers, or depending on the music played, sound harsh in [[monaural]] sound. This kind of system is also vulnerable to interference.
* Radio stations typically do not [[license]] their music for MOH systems.  In the United States, the radio broadcaster has no legal right to provide such a license as they, themselves, obtain a usage license from the music title owner for the right to broadcast said music for limited and personal use.  As mentioned below, re-broadcasting of a radio program over a phone system may likely cause licensing and [[copyright]] problems for the owner of the MOH system.
* Most radio stations (excluding those that are part of [[non-commercial educational]] radio networks) will play [[advertising|commercials]], which may be offensive or at least annoying to the caller.  Furthermore, it is possible that a [[competition|competitor's]] commercial may be played, which would be counter-productive.

:See ''[[#Legal aspects|Legal aspects]]''.

Owners of radio stations will usually air their broadcast signal as music on hold, using their main program signal, if there are several.  Examples include [[RÚV]] from [[Iceland]] using [[Rás 1]] as the on-hold music.

===Off-the-shelf commercial CDs===
{{main article|Commercial off-the-shelf}}

Commercial CDs eliminate the problems encountered with radio commercials, and they offer control over the selection of music; they do not, however, grant proper license for MOH use unless users first obtain permission from the song title copyright owner (when the song is not in the "public domain") and the mechanical copyright owner. (See "Radio," above, for more details.)

===Stock MOH CDs (with or without voice-overs)===
CDs are available that have been specifically recorded and licensed for MOH systems.  These may contain only music, or may include periodic [[voice-over]]s with messages such as "Your call is important" or "Please stay on the line".  Such off-the-shelf recordings may be generic or may be specific to individual industries, but will not be customized for individual companies.

===Custom-designed MOH===
In general, custom music on hold is advised to:
#Control content
#Control music genre
#Use the on hold time to sell to a captive audience
#Through a reputable on hold company be fully licensed and legal for on hold playback
#Reduce hang-ups and make the business look more professional
#Control length of programming based on average caller holdtime

CDs (or other MOH formats, such as MP3 files) can be custom-created to suit the particular needs of a business.  The announcements can be scripted to emphasize particular attributes of the business such as location, store hours, or special promotions or services. These are typically used for up-selling and cross-selling callers. Companies can either record the messages themselves, or hire a music on hold production company.

===Online on hold===
A program loaded onto an existing computer and connected to the phone system can allow automatic content updates interspersed with company information.

===Streaming MOH===
Streaming MOH refers to a live music on hold stream (URL-based delivery) which can also include custom content. Streams in http .mp3 format include those provided by easyonhold.com. Streaming MOH can also refer to a streaming media server, as with Cisco Unified Call Manager, in which case RTP format is utilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cisco Unified Communications SRND Based on Cisco Unified CallManager 4.x - Music on Hold  [Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CallManager)] - Cisco Systems|url = http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/srnd/4x/42moh.html#wp1043752|website = www.cisco.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free on-hold programs===
Programs available to non-profit organizations at no cost. Very few companies offer absolutely free programs. The programs are available in generic and custom formats, and are delivered at no cost to the requesting organization.

==Styles of music==
The style of music played by MOH systems depends largely on the type of business offering the service.  It is generally best to present music that will not be offensive to the audience, but that would also be of particular interest to the typical caller. A western apparel store may choose to play [[country music]]. A Christian book store may choose to play popular [[Christian music]]. A university may choose to play [[European classical music|classical music]]. An athletic ticket office may choose to play the team or school's [[fight song]]. Light classics, [[smooth jazz]], and [[beautiful music]] are common choices, as is fully [[synthesizer|synthesized]] melodic music.

The most common MOH is "Opus Number One", which is on "65 million Cisco phone sets worldwide as the default hold music," according to a ''This American Life'' podcast (number 516). The composer, Tim Carleton, recorded the song in 1989 on a four-track tape recorder with Darrick Deel. When Deel, who works at Cisco, told Carleton their song could be the default music on hold, Carleton also approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glass|first=Ira|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/516/stuck-in-the-middle|publisher=This American Life|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent trends==
With the application of newer equipment, music on hold devices can now interact with the caller. No additional programs are required on the platform, as all the logic is done with the MoH device. This can include services such as 'polling on hold', rating your customer service officer anonymously, etc. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The trend toward hosted IP telephony for business phone systems is demanding changes in music on hold message technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=Tom|title=The IP Transition: Starting Now|journal=FCC Blog|date=November 19, 2013|pages=1|url=http://www.fcc.gov/blog/ip-transition-starting-now}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, 2013, EasyOnHold.com introduced custom messages on hold streams for use with [[Asterisk (PBX)|Asterisk]] and OnSIP phone systems.

==Legal aspects==

===Copyright law===
In the US, and other countries where [[copyright law]]s are practiced, authors are granted copyright protection on their musical compositions. Such copyright protection has existed since just after the turn of the 20th century and most music written prior to 1900-1910 - from impressionism back to baroque and antiquity are said to be  "in the [[public domain]]." Use of any said music prior to the creation of these copyright laws may be presumed to be free for use by all - although individual titles may have been later copyrighted through a change in the composition or arrangement. The use of copyrighted music is not for free use in the public domain.

All music written after this period, which is copyrighted under multiple acts of congress, are owned by the author(s) or their assignees.  The use of this music is protected and controlled in order that the owner may derive usage income. Specific to telephonic MOH (music-on-hold), the US laws currently protect the copyright owners from unlawful, unpermitted use of their music titles in over-the-phone broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soundcommunication.holdcom.com/bid/96828/Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-Music-Licensing |title=Everything You Need To Know About Music Licensing |author=J. Durante |publisher=Sound Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any person or business wishing to use current, popular, post 1900-1910, copyrighted music for MOH purposes may only lawfully do so by obtaining permission from the owner.  Currently, performance rights societies such as ASCAP, BMI and SESAC will sell blanket permission to use music titles in their catalog for MOH purposes—for an express annual fee - calculated by size and frequency of usage. Failure to obtain this paid permission is a violation of US copyright laws.

This same copyright protection is also true in the rebroadcast of any radio program. As mentioned earlier, the broadcaster has been assigned a narrow and specific usage license to air copyrighted song titles. This does not include permission to any person or business to re-broadcast that program on telephonic MOH. The broadcaster may not promote such unlawful use and is not an owner who has any lawful right to grant MOH usage permission. They do not hold the ownership of the title and have no right to license use in any way. Those who plug radio broadcast into their telephone MOH without first obtaining paid permission through the owner's agents (ASCAP, BMI or SESAC) may be in violation of copyright law and may be prosecuted under existing federal laws.

===Mechanical copyright===
A second copyright exists when it comes to licensing use for telephonic MOH. A piece of music, as mentioned above, is copyrighted and may be licensed for use as a music title and is understood to be a combination of melody, harmony and, where applicable, lyrics.  However, neither radio listeners nor MOH listeners could hear this music unless it was recorded - providing a delivery medium whereby the "music" becomes a "performance."  As mentioned elsewhere, in countries such as the US, where said copyright laws are enforced, nearly every recording of a song title holds its own "mechanical copyright."

For most of the 20th century, music was recorded in studios, produced by record company executives, producers, arrangers and engineers who were hired to deliver the artist's finished recordings for mastering and duplication - for sale on the varied media: 78, 45 and 33 RPM vinyl, reel-to-reel, 8-track tape, cassette and [[compact disc]].  To protect their investment, the record companies obtain a mechanical copyright in order to protect and control the recording with which they derive usage and sales income.  (For those still uncertain of the difference between "song title" and "mechanical" copyrights,  consider the Capitol Records lawsuit for copyright infringement against Nike some 20 years ago.  Nike legally obtained permission to use the Beatles song title "Revolution" from the title's owner, Michael Jackson. They used the Capitol Records owned recording of the Beatles' performance, but failed to obtain and pay for permission and use.  Capitol Records sued and prevailed because Nike ONLY had a license to use the title and did not have a license to use the mechanical recording.)

Therefore, persons or businesses wishing to play music that falls "in the public domain" are still legally required to obtain permission to use the mechanical recording of this music, from the mechanical copyright holder.'''  '''And where the use is of copyrighted music, the same applies.  In all cases, before a song title may be broadcast on a telephone MOH, said use must be approved and licensed from BOTH the "song title" copyright owner (if it is NOT in public domain) and the "mechanical" copyright owner. '''

===Enforcement===
It is generally known within the on-hold industry that some performance rights societies, with regional offices and staff, both monitor and prosecute persons and businesses that infringe on the copyright of title holders in their libraries. [[ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] are both aggressive about this, from time to time. It is not known whether any record companies are currently or actively monitoring and prosecuting violators of their mechanical license.

The {{nihongo|'''National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto'''|京都国立近代美術館|Kyōto Kokuritsu Kindai Bijutsukan}} is an art [[museum]] in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis-Frédéric|Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric]]. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA671&amp;dq= "Museums"] in ''Japan Encyclopedia'', pp. 671-673.&lt;/ref&gt;

This Kyoto museum is also known by the English acronym MoMAK (National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto).

==History==
The National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto (MoMAK) was initially created as the Annex Museum of the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo.  MoMAK was established on its present site on March 1, 1963. Its building, formerly the auxiliary building of the Kyoto Municipal Exhibition Hall for Industrial Affairs, was transferred from Kyoto City to the National Museum after restoration.  On June 1, 1967, the Kyoto Annex Museum officially became the National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto.  Seventeen years later, the old building was dismantled and the present building, designed by  [[Fumihiko Maki]] was completed.&lt;ref name="MoMAK-IAI3"&gt;[http://www.momak.go.jp/English/about.html  MoMAK history]&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was opened to the public on October 26, 1986, with 9,761.99 m² total floor area and 2,604.94 m² exhibition area.&lt;ref name="MoMAK-IAI3"/&gt;

==MoMAK collections==
[[File:Embarkig on a Raft by Tomioka Tessai.jpg|thumb|right|''Embarking on a Raft'' by [[Tomioka Tessai]] in the National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto.]]
MoMAK is a national institution devoted to the collection and preservation of artworks and related reference materials of the twentieth century in Japan and other parts of the world.  Particular *emphasis is placed on artists or artistic movements in Kyoto and the ''Kansai'' area (the western region of Japan), such as Japanese-style paintings of the Kyoto School.&lt;ref name="MoMAK-IAI3"/&gt;

The gallery exhibits selected works of Japanese-style painting (''nihonga''), Western-style painting (''yōga''), prints, sculpture, crafts (ceramics, textiles, metalworks, wood and bamboo works, lacquers and jewelry) and photography from the museum collection, rotating the works on display approximately twenty times a year.  Outstanding and monumental works of modern art in Japan, as well as modern and contemporary European and American art are also exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.momak.go.jp/English/ MoMAK home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame''', located in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]], honors [[Oklahoma]] musicians for their lifetime achievements in [[music]]. The induction ceremony and concert are held each year in Muskogee. Since its establishment in 1997, the Hall of Fame has inducted more than 37 individuals or groups, produced more than 7 concerts, and renovated in part the facility that will educate Oklahomans for generations about those innovators and industry icons from Oklahoma.

==History==
In 1996, the [[Oklahoma Legislature]] began the vision for the Hall of Fame. State Senator Benn Robinson (D-Muskogee) and State Representative Barbara Staggs (D-Muskogee) co-authored a [[concurrent resolution]] designating Muskogee as the site of the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. State Representative Bill Settle (D-Muskogee) continued to champion the cause by securing legislative appropriations that served to further promote the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. In 1997, ''Friends of Oklahoma Music'' was incorporated to serve as producer for annual induction ceremony events. In that same year, Friends of Oklahoma Music hosted and produced the first Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony and Concert at the Muskogee Civic Center. Two years later, in 1999, [[Governor of Oklahoma]] [[Frank Keating]] created the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame Board and appointed seven members to facilitate fundraising, site selection, and construction of a facility honoring the history and legacy of Oklahoma's music, which has contributed so much to the history and roots of American music.

In 2003, Friends of Oklahoma Music entered into a long-term lease agreement with the [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|City of Muskogee]] and completed phase one of renovation to The Frisco Freight Depot, an old train depot. In October 2003, Friends and The Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame moved their offices into the Depot, which is the site of the future Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame Museum. In 2004, Friends of Oklahoma Music was renamed ''Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame Foundation''. Then in 2005, the Hall of Fame assumed its current name by being renamed ''Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame &amp; Museum''.

==Design==
[[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] from design company John Doe designed Olli from the basic shape of a [[soccer ball]]. They believe the basic shape, size and character was part of Olli's success. This made Olli easily recognizable to audiences. Olli is drawn in a minimalist style, requiring only a few lines and one [[primary color]]. Olli was created in three sizes, one small size 4.7 in. one medium, size 11 in. and one big size 7.2&amp;nbsp;ft.

==Big Olli==
There are two big Olli's. They are the elder version of small Olli. The Big Olli's is a special creature model made for several charities. One is a permanent hard [[plastic]] [[polyester]] [[statue]] at the Sophia [[Children's hospital|Children's Hospital]] and another one has a temporarily place at the [[Rotterdam Zoo]]. The big Olli that is used in the short film to save the Rotterdam ZOO is stored at a secret location according to the creators.

==Fictional character biography==
Olli is toy elephant grown to the size of a real elephant. Olli is a lovable character with furry friends living in a [[Japan]]ese [[fantasy]] world. Later in 2013 there was a story added that he was also the favorite toy of Famous Soccer player [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]]. Together they are the main cast of a short film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fr12.nl/dump/9360-olli--amp--giovanni-van-bronckhorst.html
|title=Olli &amp; Giovanni van Bronckhorst|publisher=FR12|language=Dutch|date=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rotterdam, [[Netherlands]] of 1980, Giovanni van Bronckhorst is a little boy (played in the short film by the son of Giovanni van Bronckhorst). One day, he discovers a stuffed Elephant at the Rotterdam [[Zoo]] and immediately grows attached to it. The name of the elephant is Olli. Giovanni takes him everywhere he goes, especially when he plays soccer. One day during a soccer game, he loses Olli in the canal of Rotterdam. 28 years later in 2013, Giovanni became a Famous Soccer Player and trainer of soccer club [[Feyenoord]] and Olli, also grew big, reunite again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://christianneblogs.com/2013/03/21/olli-een-aaibare-briljante-reclame

==Background==
[[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] have a history in creating things that help people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fabmagazine.nl/2014/03/wereldheerschappij-voor-rotterdamse-olli|title=Wereldheerschappij voor Rotterdamse Olli|publisher=FAB|language=Dutch|date=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To give something back to society and convince big brands to do so too. Olli was a few times part of a strategy they developed in 2004 and created Olli as a separate brand to generate [[awareness]] and in one campaign to generate more traffic and money for a [[ZOO]] in [[Rotterdam]].

==Awards==
In December 2013 [[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] of John Doe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1041/Amsterdam/article/detail/2215767/2007/06/26/John-Doe-Amsterdam-grossiert-in-prijzen.dhtml|title=John Doe grossiert in prijzen|publisher=Algemeen Dagblad|language=Dutch|date= 26 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; got awarded with the highest Dutch advertising award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/22154615/__Olli_wint_Gouden_Loeki__.html|title=Olli wint Gouden Loeki|publisher=Telegraaf|language=Dutch|date= 19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2664/Nieuws/article/detail/3565250/2013/12/19/Reclamespot-Olli-wint-Gouden-Loeki.dhtml|title=Olli wint Gouden Loeki|publisher=Volkskrant|language=Dutch|date= 19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reclamewereld.blog.nl/reclameprijzen/2013/12/19/gouden-loeki-2013-asrolli-met-reclamebureau-john-doe|title=Gouden Loeki 2013: Olli met reclamebureau John Doe|publisher=Reclamewereld|language=Dutch|date= 19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Golden Loeki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welovereclame.nl/gouden-loeki|title=Gouden Loeki Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; for this [[Advertising campaign|campaign]].

==Sales==
In 2013 Olli was used to help and save the Rotterdam zoo to generate money after the zoo lost government [[funding]]. In one year over 200.000 Olli's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.ad.nl/ad/nl/1038/Rotterdam/article/detail/3555615/2013/12/03/Knuffelolifantje-Olli-reddende-engel-diergaarde-Blijdorp.dhtml
|title=Olli reddende engel diergaarde Blijdorp|publisher=Algemeen Dagblad|language=Dutch|date=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; were sold. Olli also generated 75.000 more visitors for the Rotterdam zoo. Ollimania is a [[licensing]]
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ollimania.com/en/about-ollimania-license/|title=Olli licensing|language=Dutch|date=Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; brand for a large range of products and always attached to a good cause. In 2015 Ollimania sold over a million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ollimania.com/en/about-ollimania-license|title=Ollimania license|publisher=JohnDoe BV|date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of their licensed products.

==Charity==
Ollimania is always involved with giving back to the community.  Ollimania works with local charity organizations as well as collaborating on common projects, fund‐raisings and social activities. In 2013 Ollimania saved a historic Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BG_7Lm-CIAE1Fj7.jpg:large|title=Olli de vredesduif|publisher=AD|date= March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Ollimania brings its stuffed toy characters to children hospitals, where he interact with little patients by distributing Ollimania presents, reading out Ollimania stories, taking pictures and even organizing birthday celebrations for the most needing ones and their families. On September 10, 2015, Ollimania and its creators [[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] donated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rijnmond.nl/nieuws/10-09-2015/sophia-kinderziekenhuis-verwelkomt-olli-de-olifant|title=Sophia Kinderziekenhuis verwelkomt Olli de olifant|publisher=RTV Rijnmond|language=Dutch|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a huge Olli [[statue]] to the Sophia [[Children's hospital|Children’s Hospital]] in [[Rotterdam]]. They did this to give a smile &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metronieuws.nl/binnenland/rotterdam/2015/09/iedereen-is-blij-met-olli-in-de-hal-van-het-sophia|title=Iedereen is blij met Olli|publisher=Metro|language=Dutch|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the little patients and parents in the hospital. This original big Olli is there to stay.

== copyright infringement ==
In 2015 John Doe BV/Ollimania started a lawsuit against the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] insurance company [[ASR Nederland]] for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ie-forum.nl/?//ASR+mag+Olli-producten+na+afloop+licentieovereenkomst+blijven+uitleveren////34043/|title=John Doe BV Olli|publisher=IE Forum |date= 30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch [[Insurance]] company used illegally images and foto’s from Ollimania to sell insurances to their customers. The Dutch court ruled in favor of John Doe BV/ Ollimania and urged ASR Nederland to stop their [[copyright infringement]].
[[ASR Nederland]] had a license for a year on one of the Olli toys that expired in August 2014. The insurance company also kept 30.000 toys that were meant for the Rotterdam zoo to earn [[money]] to keep the [[ZOO]] open. [[ASR Nederland]] was entitled to keep the toys and distribute them however they see fit as long they would not infringe the copyrights of John Doe BV and Olli again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.ie-forum.nl/?//ASR+mag+Olli-producten+na+afloop+licentieovereenkomst+blijven+uitleveren////34043/|title=ASR en Olli|publisher=Reclameboek|date= 30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASR Nederland is the biggest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.slimmeropweg.nl/het-nieuwe-werken-stappenplan/gerelateerd-nieuws/item/asr-het-nieuwe-generatie-werken|title=Het nieuwe werken|publisher=Slimmer op weg|date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; insurance company of the Netherlands with almost 3000 [[employees]]. [[Hein Mevissen]], the [[artist]] and creator of Olli urged the insurance company to look in their hearts and give the [[toys]] back to the ZOO where they belong.

Prostitution is widespread and takes place on the streets and in brothels, bars, nightclubs and hotels.

Although denied by the government,&lt;ref name="ramos"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramos|first1=Adele|title=Belize "sex paradise"?|url=http://amandala.com.bz/news/belize-sex-paradise/|website=Amandala Newspaper|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the country is a destination for [[sex tourism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=539&amp;frmsrch=1|publisher=7 News Belize|title=Belizean Women Being Recruited To Work as Tourism Prostitutes|date=12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ramos" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt; [[Child sex tourism]] is a problem,&lt;ref name="amand"&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://amandala.com.bz/news/child-sex-tourism-an-emerging-trend-in-belize/ |title=Child Sex Tourism "an emerging trend in Belize"|newspaper=Amandala Newspaper|date=18 June 2010|author=Adele Ramos}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily by visitors from the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt; [[Sex trafficking]] is also a problem in the country.&lt;ref name="sextour"&gt;{{cite web|title=16 Caribbean Nations Where Sex Trafficking Remains A Problem {{!}} News Americas Now:Caribbean and Latin America Daily News|url=http://www.newsamericasnow.com/16-caribbean-nations-where-sex-trafficking-remains-a-problem/|website=News Americas Now:|accessdate=30 December 2017|date=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal situation==
Whilst prostitution is legal,&lt;ref name="state08"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/wha/119148.htm|title=2008 Human Rights Reports: Belize|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crimlaw"&gt;{{cite book|title=Belize Criminal Laws, Regulations and Procedures Handbook - Strategic Information and Basic Laws|date=7 June 2015|publisher=Intl Business Pubns USA|isbn=9781514506585|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; the buying of sexual services is not.&lt;ref name="flowers"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flowers|first1=Benjamin|title=Regional prostitution laws challenged but sex work already legal in Belize|url=http://www.reporter.bz/front-page/regional-prostitution-laws-challenged-but-sex-work-already-legal-in-belize/|website=The Reporter Newspaper|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sanpedro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution in San Pedro|url=http://ambergrisdaily.com/ambergris-caye-stories/prostitution-in-san-pedro/|website=Ambergris Daily|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related activities such as [[Procuring (prostitution)|procuring]] another person to work as a [[prostitute]], providing premises for prostitution and living off the earnings of prostitution are illegal.&lt;ref name="spl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Work Law - Countries|url=http://spl.ids.ac.uk/sexworklaw/countries|website=Sexuality, Poverty and Law|accessdate=31 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping, managing or assisting in the management of a [[brothel]] is also prohibited.&lt;ref name="state08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crimlaw" /&gt; Liquor licensing laws prohibit prostitution in bars.&lt;ref name="cnn" /&gt;

The Summary Jurisdiction (Offences) Act Chapter 98 prohibits "common prostitutes" (women who have previously received a police warning) from [[soliciting]] in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crimlaw" /&gt; "Male persons" are prohibited from loitering for the purpose of prostitution, or to persistently solicit or importune for immoral purposes.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crimlaw" /&gt;

The laws treat prostitution offences as nuisances and penalties are small.&lt;ref name="flowers" /&gt;

The Trafficking in Persons Prohibition Act of 2003 combats trafficking, but the maximum penalty is low, compared to other countries, at 5 years imprisonment or $5,000 fine.&lt;ref name="amand" /&gt;

The Immigration laws prohibit the entry into the country of prostitutes or any person living off the proceeds of prostitution.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

The laws are commonly not enforced,&lt;ref name="state08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt; and law enforcement officials are often corrupt.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

==Brothels==
Although illegal, brothels are widespread in the country.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution and Sex in Belize|url=http://guide2belize.com/belize-prostitution/|website=Guide2Belize|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orange Walk Town]] is reputed to have the highest concentration of brothels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belize it or not!|url=http://www.ontheroadwithrich.com/single-post/2016/08/28/Belize-it-or-Not|website=On the Road With Rich|accessdate=31 December 2017|language=en|date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the country's best known brothel, Raul's Rose Garden, was burnt down. It had first opened in February 1981. Before their withdrawal in the 1990s, the establishment was popular with British soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rose Garden Gutted By Fire|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=19980|website=7 News Belize|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some hotels operate a "ficha" system. Prostitutes rent rooms in the hotel and attract clients in the bar. The women are paid commission on the drinks brought by the clients before going to the rooms. The rent of the room is taken out of the commission. These hotels are often connected to nightclubs or [[Go go bar|go-go bars]].&lt;ref name="kempadoo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kempadoo|first1=Kamala|title=Sexing the Caribbean : gender, race, and sexual labor|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0415935036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military brothels===
To try and combat the spread of [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]], including [[HIV]], and by inter-governmental agreement, a number of brothels were set up for the exclusive use of British troops stationed in the country.&lt;ref name="kane"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kane|first1=SC|title=Prostitution and the military: planning AIDS intervention in Belize|url=https://www.popline.org/node/332424|website=Social Science and Medicine|accessdate=31 December 2017|language=en|date=1 April 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aids"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aggleton|first1=Peter |last2=Davies,|first2=Peter|last3=Hart|first3=Graham|title=AIDS : safety, sexuality and risk|date=1995|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0748402922}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enloe"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Enloe|first1=Cynthia|title=It takes more than two|url=http://www.rafwives.co.uk/prostitu.htm|website=RAF Wives|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prostitutes, many from [[Guatemala]],&lt;ref name="enloe" /&gt; had to carry a photo identification card&lt;ref name="enloe" /&gt; and undergo weekly health checks.&lt;ref name="enloe" /&gt; The use of [[condoms]] was mandatory.&lt;ref name="aids" /&gt;&lt;ref name="enloe" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
[[Belize]] is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. The UN Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons reported family members facilitate the sex trafficking of Belizean women and girls. In tourist regions, foreign [[Child sex tourism|child sex tourists]], primarily from the United States, exploit child sex trafficking victims. Sex trafficking of Belizean and foreign women and girls, primarily from Central America, occur in bars, nightclubs, brothels, and domestic service. LGBTI men, women, and children are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Foreign men, women, and children—particularly from Central America, Mexico, and Asia—migrate voluntarily to Belize in search of work and are often exploited by traffickers who recruit victims using false promises of relatively high-paying jobs. Some migrants are subjected to sex trafficking. Trafficking-related complicity by government officials remains a problem.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Belize 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271146.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=31 December 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Belize as a [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 3]] country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

A UK '''Restricted Service Licence''' (often called an '''RSL'''), is typically granted to radio stations and television stations broadcasting within the UK to serve a local community or a special event. Licences are granted by the broadcasting authority [[Ofcom]] (formerly the Radio Authority and the [[Independent Television Commission]], respectively).

==History==
{{Main|History of broadcasting}}
In 1972, the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] was created and given responsibility for regulating independent television and radio services in the UK. Over time, the demand for local services increased, and finally prompted an [[Act of Parliament]] to deregulate the respective industries and facilitate new long-term and short-term broadcast licences. In 1990, the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] became law, and led to the establishment of two licensing authorities: the [[Radio Authority]] to license new radio services and monitor existing licences, and the [[Independent Television Commission]], to license new short-term television services. While the 1990 act proved successful, licensing procedures to this day remain restrictive compared to those in other countries.

In 2004, the Radio Authority and ITC were folded into the [[Ofcom|Office of Communications]]. Today Ofcom handles all licensing for frequencies used by television and radio services. Until May 2015 short-range broadcasts and wireless links, and other programme makers frequencies were licensed by [[Joint Frequency Management Group|JFMG]] ([[Joint Frequency Management Group]]), owned by Arqiva. In May 2015 Ofcom made the decision to end the contract with Arqiva and to insource the existing services.&lt;ref&gt;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:eCwIsAv34_8J:jfmg.co.uk/news/ofcom-transition.aspx+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
Short-term RSLs are typically broadcast on low-power FM (1 W–25 W) or AM (1 W) and can generally last a maximum of 28 consecutive days and can only be applied for twice in twelve months with four complete months separating the two broadcast periods (and only once in twelve months inside [[Greater London]]) by the same applicant/group.

They are generally used for special events, sporting events, religious festivals, [[student radio]], [[hospital radio]] or to trial a radio project in preparation for an application for a permanent licence. Long-term RSLs (typically broadcast on low-power AM, but more recently in remote areas on low-power FM as well) are used for radio stations broadcasting to closed areas of private land such as university campuses and hospitals.  They can be compared with the [[Low-power broadcasting]] movement in the United States.

A number of stations that ran several RSL broadcasts in the 1990s and early 2000s (decade) have since gone on to run full-time [[community radio in the United Kingdom|community radio]] stations.  The first FM RSL was operated by Radio Thamesmead from the 23-24 July 1988.  The station later obtained a full time license operating as [[Time_106.8|RTM Radio]].

===Radio Stations broadcasting under a Restricted Service Licence===

Some example stations broadcast with RSLs (with more than a single appearance)

*[[Worthy FM]] ([[Glastonbury Festival]])
*[[103 The Eye]] previously TWCFM awarded the first full-time community radio licence in UK 1.11.2005 for Melton Mowbray by [[OfCom]]
*[[Radio Caroline]] a former offshore "pirate" radio station now available on satellite and Internet Radio
*[[Phoenix FM]], community radio station in Brentwood which broadcast 12 RSLs before being awarded a full-time licence by [[OfCom]]
*[[Don FM]] (London [[Pirate radio]] station)
*[[Blink FM]], a youth radio station operating at selected times annually in south Buckinghamshire.
*[[Takeover Radio]] ([[Children's radio]] service in [[Leicester]])
*[[XFM]] (London)
*[[KMFM Maidstone]], previously CTR 105.6 and 20/20FM
*[[Huntingdon Community Radio]] (Huntingdon), now awarded a full-time licence by [[OfCom]] and known as HCRfm
*[[Waves FM]], previously Waves AM. Broadcasting from Peterhead, in the North East of Scotland.
*[[GLOSS FM]], previously Thornbury FM. Broadcasts to South Gloucestershire, England.
*[[Moorlands Radio]], Broadcasts now on 103.7fm to the Staffordshire Moorlands.
*[[BigglesFM]] (Biggleswade), now awarded a full-time licence by [[OfCom]]
*[[Chaine FM]], Christmas radio station, broadcasting each December in Larne, Northern Ireland.

==Television==
{{update|date=May 2009}}
RSLs were also issued to television stations and other organisations which wished to cover a very small area. These licences (also known as '''Restricted Television Service Licences''' or '''RTS licences''') restrict power, and hence range, but not operating hours. These licences are valid for four years, and must be competed for on renewal.

The first Local TV station to go on the air in the UK with an analogue RSL licence was TV12 on the Isle of Wight. It commenced broadcasting in October 1998 from the main ITV/BBC transmitter at Rowridge. TV12's studios were initially at the Medina Centre in Newport – later moving to retail premises in the town centre and finally a factory unit on the outskirts of the town. Initially a staff of more than 25 made hundreds of hours of local programmes – most of which were filmed on location in and around the island.

Later local TV licences were awarded for stations in Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff, Carlisle, Coleraine, Derry, Dundee, Edinburgh, Fawley, Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Leicester, Limavady, Londonderry, Manchester, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Portsmouth, Reading, Southampton, Swansea, Taunton, Teesside and York.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In light of the national switch-over from analogue to digital TV the television regulator, Ofcom, extended several analogue Local TV licences until local digital switchover became due in each respective area. This process was complete in October 2012. Meanwhile in February 2009 bids were invited for auctions for the first local digital multiplex licences to be offered in the UK – the first two of which were awarded shortly thereafter. However the awarding of additional licences was halted in favour of a network of local broadcasters.[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18021144]

'''Santiago a Mil International Theatre Festival''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Festival Internacional Santiago a Mil'') is an annual [[performing arts]] [[festival]] that takes place in January in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]]. It is Z'beub Z'beub the largest arts festival in Chile and includes theatre, dance and music events from Chile and abroad, performed in the capital city, Santiago, and around the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisischile.cl/9075/2/chile-the-worlds-stage/News.aspx Chile, the world’s stage] ThisisChile.cl, 03.01.2014. Retrieved 04.01.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Run by the non-profit Teatro a Mil International Festival Foundation (FITAM), the festival aims to provide affordable access to quality cultural events for the Chilean public, to support the development of theatre and the performing arts in Chile, and to promote Chilean theatre to the international arts scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santiagoamil.cl/?page_id=2 Festival Internacional Santiago a Mil] Official website of Santiago a Mil. Retrieved 04.01.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 edition of the festival hosted 296 indoor events and 80 street-based events, attracting half a million spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santiagoamil.cl/?p=18039 Sigue disfrutando de la exposición “La historia detrás de la historia”] Official website of Santiago a Mil, 28.01.2013. Retrieved 04.01.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Santiago a Mil launched in 1994 as the ''Festival Teatro a Mil''. It was renamed ''Teatro a Mil International Festival'' in 2001 before assuming its current name in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santiagoamil.cl/?page_id=539 Historia] Official website of Santiago a Mil. Retrieved 04.01.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of the festival in 1994 ran for two months in the remodelled [[Estación Mapocho]] in Santiago. It was conceived in response to the surge in theatre and the arts experienced in Chile after the end of the [[government of Chile (1973–90)|military government]] of [[Augusto Pinochet]] in 1990. Three theatre companies took part: Teatro de la Memoria ("Memory Theatre"), who performed the ''Chile Testimonial Trilogy'' directed by Alfredo Castro; La Troppa, performing ''Pinocchio''; and Teatro del Silencio ("Theatre of Silence"), who performed ''Taca-Taca mon amour'' directed by Mauricio Celedón.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santiagoamil.cl/?page_id=571 1994] Official website of Santiago a Mil. Retrieved 04.01.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==

The name "Santiago a mil" is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Santiago for 1,000 (pesos)" and refers to the low entry price of 1,000 [[Chilean peso]]s for events in the festival's early years. It is also a play on the phrase "trabajar a mil por hora", Spanish for "working a mile a minute". Prices for some events have risen over the years but affordability is still a central factor, with several free performances and many low-cost tickets at the 2014 edition of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santiagoamil.cl/?page_id=539 Historia] Official website of Santiago a Mil. Retrieved 04.01.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Santiago a Mil 2014==
The 2014 edition of Santiago a Mil runs from January 3–19 and includes 390 events: 67 stage shows (35 by Chilean companies and 32 from abroad) as well as music, street theater, workshops, and talks. Almost 50 events are free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisischile.cl/9075/2/chile-the-worlds-stage/News.aspx Chile, the world’s stage] ThisisChile.cl, 03.01.2014. Retrieved 04.01.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival is based in Santiago but events are also being held in the [[Regions of Chile|regions]] of [[Arica y Parinacota Region|Arica y Parinacota]], [[Tarapacá Region|Tarapacá]], [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta]], [[Valparaíso region|Valparaíso]], [[O’Higgins Region|O’Higgins]] and [[Bío Bío Region|Bío Bío]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisischile.cl/9075/2/chile-the-worlds-stage/News.aspx Chile, the world’s stage] ThisisChile.cl, 03.01.2014.

'''''Skamija''''' is a student magazine for the [[Serbia]]n [[Gymnasium Jovan Jovanović Zmaj|Jovan Jovanovic Zmaj Grammar School]].

==History==
The first issue was published in 1972. ''Skamija'' changed its name and look many times.

==The Issues==
==="Silence" (2009)===
With the "Silence" issue, Art directors and high-school students Milan Jovanović and [[Tara Petrić]] have redesigned the entire magazine, changed its format, switched the font to Minion Pro, and succeeded in making a prominent visual experience in spite of the very limited budget - the issue was in its entirety black and white. It is also the first black and white issue after a long series of coloured ones.

The idea was that the birds which used to live in Skamija, have left. Unfortunately they took all colour with them. They even took the sounds, thus encapsulating "Skamija" in silence - hence the name of the issue.

==="Memoirs" (2010)===
The next issue was named "Memoirs." The main topic is the celebration of 200 years since the foundation of [[Gymnasium Jovan Jovanović Zmaj]]. The magazine's deadline was January 27, but  graphic design had less than a couple of weeks to be designed.  So as to meet the tight deadline, the editorial staff and art director had to make severe cuts. 

Despite of these cuts to meet the deadline, the issue was delayed for a month by the printing house commissioned for the job. When it arrived on February 28, the paper copies were a disaster. The colours were washed out and seemed printed by a home office printer, and the edges of the pages were not equally cut.

The Memoirs Issue, unfortunately, did not live up to its expectations, and did not outdo the previous issue. This has led to backlash between the editorial staff, the art director and faculty members.

'''TDC A/S''' or '''TDC Group''' (formerly '''T'''ele '''D'''anmark '''C'''ommunications) is a Danish telecommunications company dating back to 1879. TDC Group is the largest telecommunications company in [[Denmark]]. The company's headquarters are located in [[Copenhagen]].

TDC Group is the [[parent company]] of several [[Subsidiary|subsidiaries]] and brands: Blockbuster, Cirque A/S, Company mobile, Hiper, Dansk Kabel TV, [[Fullrate]], [[Get AS]], NetDesign, TDC Erhverv, [[Telmore]], Unotel, and [[YouSee]].

==History==
On 21 August 1882 [[Carl Frederik Tietgen]] acquired the Copenhagen division of [[International Bell Telephone Company]], an American-owned telephone exchange on Lille Kongensgade in Copenhagen, for DKK 200,000 and founded Kjøbenhavns Telefon Aktieselskab, KTS, later Kjøbenhavns Telefon Aktieselskab, KTAS.

In November 1990, the [[Folketing]] passed a law that paved the way for a nationwide Danish telecom. The company was named Tele Danmark and was the parent company for the existing regional companies (KTAS, Jydsk Telefon, Tele Sønderjylland, Fyns Telefon, and Rigstelefonen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Madsen|first1=Erling|title=Fjernsynets historie|url=http://slks.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/dokumenter/medier/Tv/Generelt/Fjernsynets_historie_Erling_Madsen_BFE.pdf|website=Slots- og Kulturstyrelsen|publisher=Erling Madsen/BFE|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TDC A/S|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Erhverv,_karriere_og_ledelse/Erhvervsliv/Erhvervsvirksomheder/TDC_AS|publisher=Den Store Danske|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the regional companies were merged into Tele Danmark, and the first nationwide cable TV company, Tele Danmark Kabel TV was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TDCs historie|url=http://aarsrapport2011.tdc.dk/Menu/Aarsrapport/Om+TDC+Koncernen/Historie/TDC%27s+historie|publisher=TDC|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, in 2000, Tele Danmark changed its name to TDC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bertelsen|first1=Jens|title=Tele Danmark ændrer navn til TDC|url=https://www.computerworld.dk/art/69048/tele-danmark-aendrer-navn-til-tdc|accessdate=19 March 2017|publisher=Computerworld|date=14 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2000 TDC got a new logo with five ovals in red, yellow, green, turquoise and blue colour. In December 2000 Tele Danmark changed its name to TDC. At the same time it demerged into a parent holding company and a number of subsidiaries with the purpose of increasing customer focus, creating greater transparency and achieving faster time to market for products and services.

Over the past decade,{{When|date=October 2012}} TDC developed from a traditional and mainly Danish provider of landline and mobile telephony services into a Danish-based [[Europe]]an provider of communications solutions. [[Deregulation]] of the Danish telecommunications market in 1996 created a highly competitive{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=July 2015}} market. In 2004, the Danish telecommunications market was fully liberalized. TDC was partly [[privatized]] in 1994 and fully privatized in 1998, and at year-end 2004, TDC's shares were held mainly by institutions and retail investors in Denmark, the United Kingdom and the United States.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In 2006 TDC adopted a new logo which consists of a cursive rounded-rectangle in blue colour. The text "TDC" appears in the rectangle and remind that the letter "D" is cut a little bit. A group of [[private equity]] firms under the banner Nordic Telephone Company (NTC) offered to buy TDC for a price of about 9.1 billion [[Euro]]. Among the group were companies such as [[Blackstone Group|Blackstone]], [[Permira]], [[Apax Partners]] and [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]]. The company bought 88% of the shares, but failed to buy more than 90% of the shares and was thus unable to remove the company completely from the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Also in 2006, TDC pulled out of the UK mobile telephone market, with the closure of their joint venture with [[EasyGroup]], EasyMobile.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In 2007, TDC folded its subsidiaries back into the parent company with the exception of TDC Kabel TV, which continued as an independent legal identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hemmingsen|first1=Mikkel|title=TDC opsluger sine datterselskaber|url=https://www.computerworld.dk/art/39134/tdc-opsluger-sine-datterselskaber|accessdate=19 March 2017|publisher=Computerworld|date=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, on 1 October 2007, TDC Kabel TV changed its name to YouSee to signal a focus on more than just TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TDC Kabel TV skifter navn|url=http://nyheder.tv2.dk/nyheder/article.php/id-8758693:tdc-kabel-tv-skifter-navn.html|accessdate=19 March 2017|publisher=TV2|date=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Nordic Telephone Company (NTC) began the process of selling its shares in TDC on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, initially reducing its 88 percent holding of the company to less than 60 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-12-09/tdc-declines-after-share-offer-price-is-announced-at-51-kroner.html|title=Bloomberg Business|work=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 TDC had a total revenue of 26 billion DKK, and employed around 9,000 people in [[Denmark]].

In 2014 TDC purchased the Norwegian telecommunications firm [[Get AS]] for 12.5&amp;nbsp;billion [[Danish krone|DKK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/15/deals-day-idUSL3N0RG30L20140915|title=Deals of the day- Mergers and acquisitions|work=Reuters|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 TDC purchased Danish IT- and telecom provider Cirque A/S for an unspecified amount.

On 1 July 2016 the TDC consumer business was merged with YouSee, migrating the entire TDC customer base of IPTV, broadband and mobile consumers to YouSee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Breinstrup|first1=Thomas|title=Presset TDC bliver til YouSee i Danmark|url=http://www.business.dk/digital/presset-tdc-bliver-til-yousee-i-danmark|accessdate=20 March 2017|date=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mobile phone network continues to use the 'TDC' name, as its built by TDC Group instead of YouSee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nyt navn: TDC er blevet til YouSee|url=http://meremobil.dk/2016/06/tdc-er-nu-yousee/|accessdate=20 March 2017|date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TDC Group and [[Modern Times Group]] announced on 1 February 2018 a plan for TDC Group to buy MTG Nordics to create a converged business with a new name and brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Briel|first1=Robert|title=TDC buys MTG Nordics to form converged business|url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2018/02/01/tdc-buys-mtg-nordics-to-form-converged-business/|accessdate=9 April 2018|agency=Broadband TV News|date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hummelmose|first1=Jens E.|title=Fusion: Ny underholdningskæmpe med YouSee, Viasat, TV3 og Viaplay|url=http://www.recordere.dk/2018/02/fusion-ny-underholdningskaempe-med-yousee-viasat-tv3-og-viaplay/|accessdate=9 April 2018|agency=Rec.dk|date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, a takeover bid from the Australian infrastructure group [[Macquarie Group|Macquarie]] and three Danish pension funds; PFA, PKA and [[Arbejdsmarkedets Tillægspension|ATP]] was leaked to the public, which TDC had rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Afvist TDC-bud med til at løfte aktieværdi med fem milliarder|url=https://www.business.dk/oekonomi/afvist-tdc-bud-med-til-at-loefte-aktievaerdi-med-fem-milliarder|accessdate=9 April 2018|agency=Berlingske|date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consortium clarified that the proposed MTG merger was not part of their strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Madsen|first1=Thomas Nygaard|title=Konsortium har ikke haft MTG-fusion som en del af planen for TDC-opkøb|url=https://mediawatch.dk/Medienyt/TV/article10290122.ece|accessdate=9 April 2018|agency=MediaWatch|date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February the consortium launched an improved take-over offer, which TDC Group now recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Briel|first1=Robert|title=TDC recommends new takeover offer|url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2018/02/13/tdc-recommends-new-takeover-offer/|accessdate=9 April 2018|agency=Broadband TV News|date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed MTG merger was called off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hummelmose|first1=Jens E|title=TDC dropper opkøb af MTG|url=http://www.recordere.dk/2018/02/tdc-dropper-opkoeb-mtg/|accessdate=9 April 2018|agency=Rec.dk|date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Complete Peanuts''''' is a series of books containing the entire run of [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s long-running newspaper comic strip ''[[Peanuts]]''. The series was published at a rate of two volumes per year, each containing two years of strips (except for the first volume which includes 1950–1952). Slipcased sets of two volumes are also available. The series comprises a total of 26 volumes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/591072081.html?dids=591072081:591072081&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=MAR+28%2C+2004&amp;author=Tom+Beer&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=You're+High+Art%2C+Charlie+Brown&amp;pqatl=google|title=You're High Art, Charlie Brown|work=The Washington Post article by Tom Beer}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a bonus book with sketches, interviews, and other extra material. These hardcover books were first published between 2004–2016. Later ''Fantagraphics Books'' also began publishing the series in a softcover format. A companion series titled ''Peanuts Every Sunday'', collecting only the Sunday strips of the ''Peanuts'' series, was launched by Fantagraphics in 2013 and is scheduled to run until 2022.

Schulz began to discuss an anthology of his work with [[Fantagraphics Books]] in 1997. The idea of a complete compendium of all published ''Peanuts'' strips was long resisted by Schulz; he did not want some early strips reprinted as he felt they were not as good as the ones he drew later in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/books/2001857267_peanuts15.html|title=Seattle's Fatagraphics Books will release 'The Complete Peanuts'|last=McKinnon|first=Heather|date=2004-02-15|work=|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 2,000 of the 17,897 strips had never appeared in a previous U.S. collection.

The first book in the series was published in April 2004 and topped the ''[[New York Times Best Seller List]]''.

==Volumes==
Besides Schulz's work, each book contains an introduction by an influential individual (often with a connection to Schulz), an index of themes and characters, additional art by designer [[Seth (cartoonist)|Seth]] (all of which is directly based on a specific ''Peanuts'' panel), and a biography of Schulz written by series editor [[Gary Groth]]. In addition, the first volume contains an interview with Schulz conducted by Groth and an extended biography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snoopy.com/comics/peanuts/news/news_042005.html|title=The Official Peanuts Website&amp;nbsp;– News|work=The Official Peanuts Website Announcement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunday panels, which originally appeared in color, are presented in black and white in the series (a decision approved by Schulz's widow, Jean Schulz). The hardcover volumes measure {{convert|8.5|in|mm}} × {{convert|7|in|mm}} while the softcover volumes are {{convert|8.25|in|mm}} × {{convert|6.5|in|mm}}.

All the characters on the covers (and their styles) match the time period each volume represents.

Volume 25, covering the years 1999 and 2000, also includes the complete run of Schulz's 1947–50 strip ''[[Li'l Folks]]''. This precursor includes early versions of Charlie Brown and Snoopy. A 26th and final volume was announced in 2016 which includes hundreds of miscellaneous sketches, designs, short stories, and covers drawn by Schulz.

'''''The Desert Peach''''' is a [[comic book]] created by [[Donna Barr]],  chronicling the adventures of the [[eponymous]] protagonist, [[Erwin Rommel|Erwin "The Desert Fox" Rommel]]'s fictitious [[homosexual]] younger brother, [[Oberst]] '''Manfred Pfirsich Marie Rommel''' (1900–1990), nicknamed the "Desert Peach". Early issues of the comic focused on the Peach's command of a misfit unit of the [[Afrika Korps]] from 1940 to 1943; subsequent issues have explored the pre- and post-war lives of Pfirsich ([[German language|German]] for "[[Peach]]") and his supporting cast.

==Publication history==
''The Desert Peach'' was first published in 1988, by Thoughts and Images, later by MU Press/AEON, and still later by A Fine Line. 32 issues were released throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, and subsequently re-released in eight collected volumes; as well, a Desert Peach [[musical theatre|musical]] was produced in 1992, and ''Bread and Swans'', a Desert Peach [[novel]], was released in 2005. With the exception of the musical, all Desert Peach material has been created entirely by Barr.

Barr took ''Peach'' to the [[Modern Tales]] [[webcomics]] collective, where she explored Pfirsich's [[afterlife]]: wracked with guilt for having failed to save enough people from the [[Holocaust]], he sentenced himself to [[Hell]]. The website ceased operations in 2012 and the comics were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/one-of-those-things/|title=One of Those Things - The Comics Journal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
Barr has said that she was inspired to create the character while working in the file office of the University of Washington, which was being painted a "horrible half-pink, half-tan color."  Searching for a color name, she stumbled upon "desert peach", and was immediately inspired by the pun upon "The Desert Fox," the name given to Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] during [[World War II]] . According to his biographers, [[Erwin Rommel]] had a youngest brother, named Manfred, who died in infancy&amp;mdash;Barr said she only developed a personality who the universe had prematurely discarded.

==Supporting cast==

The Desert Peach commanded the 469th [[Halftrack]], Gravedigging and Support Unit of the Afrika Korps: a catch-all for misfits, mavericks, and otherwise peculiar soldiers who, for whatever reason, were not suitable for service in the German Army but nonetheless were enlisted. In the words of their medical officer (a [[psychiatrist]] assigned to the 469th because his specialty was considered a "[[Deutsche Physik|Jewish science]]"), it was a unit composed "entirely of stray puppies".

The 469th was based on an escarpment by the sea. Pfirsich was of the opinion that a commander should not merely lead his troops but protect them, and arranged with local [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] commanders that there would be no fighting in that area (although newcomers did not always accept this ''[[modus vivendi]]'').

Throughout the series, Barr focused on many characters; the following list includes some of the most prominent.

*[[Obergefreiter]] '''Udo Schmidt''': Pfirsich's [[orderly]] and [[aide-de-camp]]. Scruffy, dirty, ill-tempered, dark-skinned, secretly Jewish, and with a habit of using pages from ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' as [[rolling paper]]s, Schmidt was the 469th's only card-carrying member of the [[Nazi Party]]. He claimed that his reason for joining was that he had been very young and a desperate Party recruiter had bought him beer.
*[[Leutnant]] '''Kjars Dagobert Winzig''': the 469th's self-appointed [[Political commissar|political officer]]. A concert pianist in civilian life, the blond, blue-eyed Winzig was an enthusiastic, [[armband]]-wearing supporter of Hitler and Nazism. However, he was not actually a party member, since (as he shamefacedly explained) "party members have to pay dues".
*[[Oberleutnant]] '''Rosen Kavalier''': ace [[Luftwaffe]] [[Aviator|pilot]], and the Peach's [[gay marriage|fiancé]]. A cheerful adventurer, bold and brash, Rosen (whose real name, thanks to his British father, was '''Melvin Gonville Ramsbottom''') once got Pfirsich drunk enough to have heterosexual sex for the first time, claiming that he should experience it at least once. This encounter led to the birth of Pfirsich's son.
*[[Obergefreiter]] '''Heinrich Dobermann''': [[munitions]] expert. As the result of a training accident on a [[minefield]], Dobermann was [[brain damage|brain-damaged]], mildly insane, and addicted to several [[painkiller]]s and [[psychotropic]] medications. As well, he adopted a live [[Tellermine 42]] as a pet, naming it "Fridl".
* '''Kristof Falbe''': the 469's mute radio operator. Never speaks, just taps the radio microphone to communicate. Always seen holding a small stuffed dinosaur.

'''''The Number 23''''' is a 2007 American [[psychological horror]] [[Thriller film|thriller]] film written by Fernley Phillips and directed by [[Joel Schumacher]].

The film was released in the United States on February 23, 2007. This is the second film to pair Schumacher and Carrey, the first being ''[[Batman Forever]]''. The film grossed $77.6 million and has an approval rating of 8% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

==Plot==
Walter Sparrow is an [[animal control officer]] married to Agatha; they have a son, Robin. At a bookstore, Agatha begins looking at a book titled ''The Number 23'' written by Topsy Kretts. She later gives Walter the book as a birthday present. Walter starts reading the book, noticing odd similarities between himself and the main character, a detective who refers to himself as "[[Fingerling (character)|Fingerling]]." Mirroring the detective, Walter becomes obsessed with the [[23 enigma]], the idea that all incidents and events are directly connected to the number 23, or to some number connected to 23. When he tries to warn Agatha about the number, she tells him he is crazy.

Walter's obsession leads him to believe that the book has secret insights into his own life. When he reads that Fingerling murders his girlfriend, Walter begins having dreams about murdering Agatha. Agatha refers him to her friend, Isaac French, who suggests Walter find the book's author if he wants answers. Walter's search leads him to discover the murder of Laura Tollins. Now believing the book to be a veiled confession, Walter searches for her killer.

Evidence found at a psychiatric hospital reveals Walter in fact is Topsy Kretts, having written the book as a way to rid himself of the guilt he felt over murdering Tollins. He was never suspected of the crime, and a man named Kyle Flinch was convicted and imprisoned instead. Walter had dated Tollins 13 years earlier, but she left him for Flinch. Walter stabbed Tollins to death in a jealous rage and left the scene of the crime, moments before Flinch arrived and touched the knife, implicating himself in the murder. Wracked with guilt, Walter decided to kill himself and began writing a suicide note, but found that he could not stop writing; the note ultimately became the book. He survived his suicide attempt, but the resulting head trauma left him with amnesia.

Fearing he will hurt his family, he leaves home and moves to the same hotel in which he had attempted suicide. Agatha finds Walter at the hotel and assures him that he is no longer the person he was when he wrote the book. He insists that he is a killer and tells Agatha to leave before he kills her, too. He leaves the hotel and runs into the street, where he nearly allows himself to be run over by a bus. Walter steps out of the way at the last minute when he realizes his son is watching. Walter turns himself in to the police and awaits sentencing, having been told that the judge will likely go easy on him. A funeral procession takes place in front of Tollins' grave, where it is implied her body has finally been laid to rest, as Flinch observes, a free man.

==Reception==
The film has an approval rating of 8% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 189 reviews; the average rating is 3.5.  The site's consensus reads: "Jim Carrey has been sharp in a number of non-comedic roles, but this lurid, overheated, and self-serious potboiler is not one of them. ''The Number 23'' is clumsy, unengaging, and mostly confusing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_number_23/ The Number 23], rottentomatoes.com, accessed March 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the few critics who liked the film, [[Richard Roeper]] and critic George Pennachio of [[KABC-TV]] in [[Los Angeles]] stand out, as they gave the film a "2 thumbs up" rating on the television show ''[[At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper|Ebert &amp; Roeper]]'' (Pennachio was standing in for [[Roger Ebert]] due to Ebert's illness).&lt;ref&gt;''Ebert &amp; Roeper'', air date February 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Michael Phillips (theatre critic)|Michael Phillips]], filling in for Ebert on the Worst of 2007 show (aired January 12, 2008) put ''The Number 23'' at No. 7 in his list of the worst (Roeper did not include it in his list). [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' declared the film the year's worst [[star vehicle]] on his list of the Worst Movies of 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[[Travers, Peter]], (December 19, 2007) [https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/17686508/peter_travers_best_and_worst_movies_of_2007/15 "Peter Travers' Best and Worst Movies of 2007"] ''Rolling Stone''. Retrieved 2007-12-20&lt;/ref&gt; while Colm Andrew of the ''[[Manx Independent]]'' said the film "delivers a rambling, confusing narrative with only a few stylistic elements thrown in".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iomtoday.co.im/reviews?articleid=2221070 Review by Colm Andrew] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201082034/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/reviews?articleid=2221070 |date=February 1, 2009 }}, IOM Today&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show'''" is a second-season episode of the ''[[Adult Swim]]'' animated television series ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]''.

==Plot==
The episode begins inside the [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] headquarters with fictional president of entertainment Wedgie Rudlin holding the Monday staff meeting on Thursday and calling himself the "new, super-duper smart, [[Harvard University]]-educated President of Entertainment." After asking staff members why he was hired, Rudlin says it's time to take BET in a new direction. After firing a board member, Rudlin tells his staff to make "The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show" happen.

Following the opening credits, Uncle Ruckus is shown chronicling his life. His day typically starts at 4:45am with him praying to "The White Man" and for blacks. Ruckus denies being black and states he suffers from "Re-[[vitiligo]]", (the opposite of what [[Michael Jackson]] claimed he had), and applies an ointment composed of bleach and sulfur.

Ruckus goes on to talk about his shrines to his white heroes including [[John Wayne]] and [[George H. W. Bush]]. He also mentions he works 32 jobs, including bus driver where he is ignored and insulted by the suburban kids: "These kids are pure human race." Ruckus stops the Freeman brothers (the only kids who show him a shred of respect) from boarding: "This bus is for kids with a future!"

Next Ruckus is seen at J. Edgar Hoover Elementary, working as a janitor, mopping the hall, bemoaning [[desegregation]], and ranting about black people in education and films. After school Ruckus approaches Jazmine and asks if she is waiting for her father Tom, explaining to the camera "He married to a white woman, lucky son of a bitch". Tom arrives in a kilt and tells Ruckus of his Scottish heritage and how [[Genealogical DNA test|he took a DNA test]] that revealed he was 32.5% Scottish.

Ruckus then visits a scientist and receives the results of his ethnic makeup. Midway through the scene, the action pans back to BET where Rudlin tells Debra Leevil (the same parody of BET CEO [[Debra L. Lee]] seen in [[The Hunger Strike|the previous episode]]) to start BET animation in order to destroy the minds of black kids at a younger age. A board member shows Leevil his creation: "Super Cyborg Mandigo Man", with the script in flipbook form, showing a stick figure throwing a spear.

Leevil, unimpressed because the show isn't evil enough, summons her associates, "Big Nigga" and "Crazy Bitch" to beat up the board member, who screams unsuccessfully for Rudlin to save him. Leevil then asks about the Uncle Ruckus show and Rudlin tells her it is. Leevil issues a threat of killing, or at least serious injury.

On the show, Ruckus receives his [[Genealogical DNA test|DNA test]] results, which reveal that he is 102% [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] with a 2% [[margin of error]]; he retreats into a bed-bound depression and quits all his jobs and contemplates selling "crack" and doubts he has re-vitiligo and calls on the Freemans for advice on how to be black. Robert points out there's nothing wrong with being black. In a sports store (probably [[Foot Locker]]), Ruckus complains about no shoes named after white men. Afterward, while getting his hair cut, Ruckus jumps to the defense of U.S. president [[George W. Bush]].

Meanwhile, Rudlin kidnaps the doctor who gave Ruckus his results and forces him to send new results after unsuccessfully torturing him (the power for the building and the 'torture machine' went out, since the electric bill wasn't paid).

Ruckus tries everything to adjust to his new status including reading ''[[Ebony Magazine]]'' and drinking [[malt liquor]]. Ruckus contemplates [[suicide]] but Rudlin arrives and prevents it. The scientist arrives, blames the "mistake" on a black intern, and reveals new results: Ruckus is 50.07% [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]].

The episode ends with Ruckus, as a [[crossing guard]], stating he has a "whole new perspective on life" and "a lot more sympathy" towards colored folks. Huey and Riley walk past and Ruckus assures them it's safe to cross, then lets a large truck drive towards them. The truck narrowly misses them, prompting Ruckus to laugh at their misfortune.

==Airing and BET==
This show and its preceding episode ("[[The Hunger Strike]]") were not (initially as both have been seen) aired on Adult Swim. A [[Cartoon Network]] representative stated that BET had not contacted Cartoon Network regarding the episodes.&lt;ref&gt;Brodesser-Akner, Claude. "[http://adage.com/article?article_id=124786 Net-Bashing 'Boondocks' Banned]." ''Advertising Age'', February 4, 2008. Retrieved on 08-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sony Pictures Television]], which produces the series, has not issued a statement on the matter. The episodes are said to specifically attack [[Reginald Hudlin|Reggie Hudlin]], BET's president of entertainment, and [[Debra L. Lee]], president and chief executive officer of BET Holdings (parent company of BET.) Lee is portrayed as Deborah Leevil, a parody of the character [[Dr. Evil]] from the [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] movies, and Hudlin is portrayed as Wedgie Rudlin, a "culturally insensitive buffoon coasting on his [[Ivy League]] education."&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/04/entertainment/et-boondocks4|title=''Los Angeles Times'' article about the banned Boondocks episodes|publisher=articles.latimes.com|accessdate=October 17, 2008 | date=June 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;    In this episode, Leevil is portrayed to be much like [[Doctor Evil]] from the [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] movies, by placing her finger near her mouth when excited or emphasizing a statement or using the word "evil."  Leevil also speaks in much the same way as Doctor Evil.

It is noted that Hudlin was responsible for producing ''The Boondocks'' with McGruder before serving as president of BET from 2005 to 2008, effectively ending the partnership between the two. McGruder is known to be very critical of the television network's work and programming.

'''Titan Entertainment Group (TEG)''' is a British retailing, publishing and merchandise company - owner of the [[Forbidden Planet (bookstore)|Forbidden Planet]] bookstore chain, [[Titan Magazines]], [[Titan Comics]], [[Titan Merchandise]] and [[Titan Books]]. 
TEG is owned by [[Nick Landau]] and [[Vivian Cheung]].

== History ==

=== Titan Distributors ===
Up through the mid-1970s, only a small range of American comic books were available in British newsagents. Landau saw the [[Direct market|distribution]] opportunity, and along with [[Mike Lake (businessman)|Mike Lake]] and [[Mike Luckman]], formed '''Comic Media Distributors'''. Soon changing its name to '''Titan Distributors''', Landau operated the business until 1992, when he and Lake parted company. (Lake almost immediately sold Titan Distributors to the American comics distributor [[Diamond Comic Distributors]].)&lt;ref&gt;"NewsWatch: Diamond Acquires Titan Distributors," ''The Comics Journal'' #154 (November 1992), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forbidden Planet ===
{{main|Forbidden Planet (bookstore)}}
Early on, Landau was "forced" into retail by the closure of one of his leading customers; he needed to take a radical step to avoid going out of business himself.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} In 1978, Titan Entertainment Group opened its first Forbidden Planet bookstore, on Denmark Street in London.

In 1992 Landau and Luck parted company. Landau established TEG, through which he and partner Vivian Cheung ran Forbidden Planet. A separate business, '''Forbidden Planet International''', was established by Luck. These FPI stores were mainly located in northern England and Scotland. 

Although TEG has made some attempts to establish Forbidden Planet abroad, there are no longer any TEG-owned FP stores outside the UK.

=== Titan Publishing Group ===

==== Titan Books ====
{{main|Titan Books}}
In 1981, TEG started [[Titan Books]], publishers of both new and licensed graphic novels and film and TV tie-ins.

==== Titan Magazines ====
{{main|Titan Magazines}}
[[Titan Magazines]], officially launched in 1995, publishes ''[[Star Trek Magazine]]'', the [[Wallace and Gromit]] comic, UK editions of [[Simpsons Comics]], and many other titles.

==== Titan Merchandise ====

[[Titan Merchandise]] (launched in 2011) produces high-quality licensed merchandise for global properties, including Marvel Comics, Star Wars, Doctor Who, The Beatles, Star Trek, Alien, Breaking Bad, Ghostbusters and Hammer Horror.

{{main|Titan Comics}}
In the mid 2000s, TEG started [[Titan Comics]], a bold new publishing initiative from Titan Publishing, offering readers the best new stories from new and established comics creators.

2JJ commenced broadcasting at 11:00&amp;nbsp;am, Sunday 19 January 1975, at 1540 [[Hertz|kHz]] (which switched to 1539[[Hertz|kHz]] in 1978) on the [[AM radio|AM]] band.&lt;ref name=continuum_6_1&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/6.1/Dawson.html|title=JJJ:radical radio?|last=Dawson|first=Jonathan|journal=Continuum: the Australian Journal of Media &amp; Culture|volume=6|issue=1|year=1992|accessdate=9 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) station was given the official call-sign '''2JJ''', but soon became commonly known as '''Double J'''.&lt;ref name = Webb&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/triple-js-40th-birthday-high-times-with-the-department-of-youth-20150108-12k5m4.html|title = Triple J's 40th birthday: High times with the department of youth|last = Marius|first = Webb|date = 10 January 2015|work = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = 12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The station was restricted largely to the greater Sydney region, and its local reception was hampered by inadequate transmitter facilities. However, its frequency was a clear [[channel (broadcasting)|channel]] nationally, so it was easily heard at night throughout south-eastern Australia. After midnight the station would often use ABC networks – during their off air time slot – to increase its broadcasting range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioheritage.net/Story90.asp |title= Radio Power Plays 1975-81 Melbourne, Sydney &amp; Wellington|publisher=Radio Heritage Foundation|accessdate=4 February 2008|author=David Ricquish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first broadcast demonstrated a determination to distinguish itself from other Australian radio stations. The first on-air presenter, DJ [[Holger Brockmann]], notably used his own name (a deliberate reference to his former work for top-rated Sydney pop station [[2SM]]). Owing to 2SM's restrictive policies at the time, Brockmann, whose real name was considered "too foreign-sounding", had been forced to work using the pseudonym "Bill Drake" in prior positions. After an introductory audio collage that featured sounds from the countdown and launch of [[Apollo 11]], Brockmann launched the station's first-ever broadcast with the words, "Wow, and we're away!", and then cued The Skyhooks' ''[[You Just Like Me 'Cos I'm Good in Bed]]''.&lt;ref name = Webb /&gt;

The choice of a [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]] song to introduce the station was significant, as it represented several important features of the Double Jay brand at the time. Choosing an Australian band reflected Double J's commitment to Australian content at a time when American acts dominated commercial pop stations. Most notably, the song was one of several tracks from the Skyhooks' album that had been banned from airplay on commercial radio by the industry's peak body.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Because Double J was a government-funded station operating under the umbrella of the ABC, it was not bound by commercial-radio censorship codes, and was not answerable to advertisers or the station owners. In contrast, their Sydney rival, 2SM, was owned by a holding company controlled by the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney, resulting in the ban or editing of numerous songs.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

2JJ was a product of the progressive media policies of the [[Whitlam Government]] of 1972–75,&lt;ref name=JJJHist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/about/about.htm |title=About triple j|publisher=[[abc.net.au]]|work=triple j|accessdate=2 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080112165334/http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/about/about.htm |archivedate = 12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and combined influences from several earlier ABC programs, such as "Room to Move", as well as the freewheeling programming policies of British [[pirate radio]] and [[BBC Radio 1]], which was created to target the pirate radio audience. The inspiration gained from the UK led to Double J adopting the tradition of weekly, live-in-the-studio performances by pop and rock bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milesago.com/Radio/2jj.htm |title=Radio - Double Jay: the first year |publisher=Milesago |date= |accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gough Whitlam]] was unable to also fulfill his aspiration for the establishment of a "National Youth Radio Network", as he was controversially sacked.&lt;ref name="Fast"&gt;{{cite web|title=12 things you should know about Double J|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/39015/12-things-you-should-know-about-Double-J|work=Faster Louder|publisher=Faster Louder Pty Ltd|accessdate=12 April 2014|author=Darren Levin|date=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2JJ presenter, and the first female DJ on Australian pop radio, Gayle Austin, who was completing a [[Master of Arts]](MA) on Triple J's first 16 years in 2005, explained that 2JJ staff had also heard of other motivations for the founding of the station:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Word was the Whitlam government wanted to set the station up to woo young voters. We also heard that the ABC was worried about its audience dying off and wanted a station for young people who would grow up to be ABC listeners.&lt;ref name="Gay"&gt;{{cite news|title=Off the dial|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/TV--Radio/Off-the-dial/2005/01/11/1105423476299.html?oneclick=true|accessdate=12 April 2014|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=12 January 2005|author=Gayle Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally, the station was one of a series of innovations that stemmed from the recommendations in the [[McLean Report]] of 1974. These included expanding radio broadcasting onto the [[Frequency Modulation|FM]] band, issuing a new class of broadcasting license which finally permitted the establishment of community radio stations (the long-awaited third tier of the Australian radio industry), and the creation of two new stations for the ABC — 2JJ in Sydney and the short-lived 3ZZ in Melbourne.&lt;ref name=continuum_6_1/&gt;&lt;ref name="geocities"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/4018/morehist.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+08:06:44|website=webcitation.org|title=Bob Hope-Hume, ''A History of Community Radio'' |date=11 March 2009|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time 2JJ went to air, the Whitlam government was in its final months of office. [[Marius Webb]], one of the station's co-ordinators recalls an ABC executive informing him: "You'll be on the air by January. Thank you very much, I've got another meeting."&lt;ref name="Fast" /&gt; On 11 November 1975, Whitlam's commission was [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|revoked]] by Governor-General Sir [[John Kerr (governor-general)|John Kerr]], sparking a double dissolution of parliament. In the subsequent [[Australian federal election, 1975|1975 federal election]], Labor was defeated by the Liberal-National Party coalition that was led by [[Malcolm Fraser]]. During the more conservative media climate that emerged in the Fraser years, 2JJ staff were frequently accused of [[left-wing]] bias.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} 2JJ was initially intended to be the first link in Whitlam's planned national youth network; but the expansion was greatly delayed by the election of the Fraser government and the subsequent budget cuts it imposed on the ABC.&lt;ref name=Almanac1975 /&gt;

It was a historic moment in Australian radio, when the station decided to hire a female disc jockey&lt;ref name="Fast" /&gt; and, excluding the first experimental FM licences, was granted the first new radio licence issued in any Australian [[capital city]] since 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/01/1062383510184.html?from=storyrhs |title=Licence to thrill|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=1 September 2003|accessdate=13 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early years 2JJ's on-air staff were mainly recruited from either commercial radio or other ABC stations. Later, in another first, the roster also featured presenters who did not come from a radio industry background, including singer-songwriters [[Bob Hudson (Australian singer)|Bob Hudson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classic Cafe|url=http://www.2st.com.au/shows/the-classic-cafe/65652-bob-hudson-the-newcastle-song|work=2ST|publisher=Grant Broadcasters radio network|accessdate=12 April 2014|year=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413141553/http://www.2st.com.au/shows/the-classic-cafe/65652-bob-hudson-the-newcastle-song|archivedate=13 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John J. Francis, and actor [[Lex Marinos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lex Marinos|url=http://www.abc.net.au/profiles/content/s3358160.htm|work=ABC|publisher=ABC|accessdate=12 April 2014|date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis commenced broadcasting in the Saturday midnight-to-dawn shift in 1975, and the program became so popular that it was expanded to include Friday and Sunday nights two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John J Francis|url=http://www.reverbnation.com/artist_2449363/bio|work=John J Francis on ReverbNation|publisher=eMinor, Inc|accessdate=12 April 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation staff of January 1975 were: Webb and Ron Moss&lt;ref name="Fast"/&gt; (co-ordinators), [[Ros Cheney]], David Ives, Sam Collins, Holger Brockman (aka Bill Drake), Caroline Pringle, [[Bob Hudson (Australian singer)|Bob Hudson]], Mike Parker, [[Iven Walker]], [[Arnold Frolows]], Di Auburn, Margot Edwards, [[George Wayne (Australian broadcaster)|George "Groover" Wayne]], Graeme Berry, John Arden, Colin Vercoe, [[Alan McGirvan]], Pam Swain, Graeme Bartlett, [[Mark Colvin]], Keith Walker, Michael Byrne, and Jim Middleton.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Elder &amp; David Wales, ''Radio With Pictures! The History of Double Jay AM and JJJ FM'' (Hale &amp; Ironmonger, 1984), pp.6-7&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular presenters of the 2JJ period included Austin (a former producer for talkback radio king [[John Laws]]&lt;ref name="Fast" /&gt;), [[Russell Guy]], [[Mac Cocker]] (father of musician [[Jarvis Cocker]]),&lt;ref name="Fast" /&gt; [[Tom Zelinka]], [[Lawrie Zion]], and [[Keri Phillips]]. Several of the original team developed successful careers at the ABC: Mark Colvin hosted ABC Radio National's current affairs show ''[[PM (ABC Radio)|PM]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Colvin|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/mark_colvin.htm|work=Radio National|publisher=ABC|accessdate=12 April 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Middleton hosts ''Newsline with Jim Middleton'' on ABC Television; and Ros Cheney became Arts Editor of ABC radio until her dismissal in 2001 (during the controversial regime of [[Jonathan Shier]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://friendsoftheabc.org/media-releases/this-bloodletting-must-stop-13-june-2001 |title='Friends of the ABC' website |accessdate=28 October 2009 |publisher=Friendsoftheabc.org |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626000122/http://friendsoftheabc.org/media-releases/this-bloodletting-must-stop-13-june-2001 |archivedate=26 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2JJ's programming policies were considered a radical departure from the formats of commercial stations. In 2005 Austin published a recollection from Colin Vercoe, one of the station's first music programmers: "In those days it was the early disco stuff and if it was black they just wouldn't play it."&lt;ref name="Gay" /&gt; 2JJ was also a pioneer in terms of its coverage of local music. Austin stated in a 2005 ABC radio special to commemorate the youth station's 30th anniversary: "There was very little Australian music. At that time Australian music didn’t have much production put into it because there wasn’t much money made out of it."&lt;ref name="Fast" /&gt; 2JJ announcer Chris Winter explained that "there was enormous breadth of music around at the time" that was not played on radio, but could be heard in private gatherings or bought from specialist stores. Austin states that the original aim of 2JJ was to highlight "our own culture" and the staff were expected to "provide an alternative to the mainstream, with a heavy emphasis on Australian content". 2JJ consequently garnered a reputation for not only eclectic playlists, but also radical talk content:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... it was in the talk area that the really radical work was done. Comedy acts such as Chuck Chunder and the Space Patrol, Captain Goodvibes, Nude Radio (Graham Bond and Rory O'Donoghue's show, which launched Norman Gunston), Fred Dagg (aka John Clarke) and the legendary "anti-ads" informed future program-makers on how humour could be used on radio.&lt;ref name="Gay" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The station also sought to create a genuine dialogue with listeners, whereby the audience could claim a sense of ownership of the station, and announcers even played demo tapes recorded by listeners who were also musicians, the start of what is now known as triple j unearthed. Austin explained in 2005:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In that first year we had a station policy of access all areas. In early March, women took over the station as announcers to celebrate International Women's Day. The listeners owned the station, too, and if they wanted to come to the meetings and join the debate, they were welcome. This attitude led to some interesting moments, such as when Holger Brockman's shift was hijacked by three Aboriginal activists. They entered the studio and said they were armed and hijacking the station. Brockman said: "Oh, OK. Well, that's the microphone there, and here you are, have my seat." Brockman says they were really polite. "They said their bit, which took about five or 10 minutes, and then politely handed back to me - 'And now back to Holger.' Respectfully, like family."&lt;ref name="Gay" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The station played an unprecedented level of Australian content, as well as imported music, music brought in from the staff's personal collections, music purchased by overseas correspondents, and songs banned by other stations because of religious or sexual controversies. The first song played on air on the first broadcast day, "[[You Just Like Me 'Cos I'm Good in Bed]]" by the [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]], was banned on commercial radio for its explicit sexual content.&lt;ref name="Fast" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Almanac1975&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milesago.com/Almanac/1975.htm |title=The Almanac: 1975|publisher=MILESAGO|accessdate=3 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Music/Strike-up-the-banned/2005/06/17/1118869080230.html |title=Warwick McFadyen, "Strike Up The Banned", '&amp;#39;The Age, 18 June 2005 |accessdate=28 October 2009 |publisher=Theage.com.au |date=18 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Double J also featured regular news broadcasts, current affairs programs, political commentary by noted journalist [[Mungo Wentworth MacCallum|Mungo MacCallum]], and audio documentaries like the controversial ''The Ins and Outs of Love'' (produced by former 2SM producers [[Carl Tyson-Hall]] and Tony Poulsen), which included frank interviews with young people about their first experiences of sex. The Tyson-Hall and Poulsen documentary had allegedly "breached community standards" and, although the ABC reportedly received few direct complaints about ''The Ins and Outs of Love'' (originally broadcast on Sunday, 23 February 1975), the documentary sparked a debate in the media and the Broadcasting Control Board (BCB) reportedly asked for talks with the ABC. Two days after the documentary was broadcast, [[Fairfax Media|Fairfax]] tabloid ''The Sun'' published an editorial calling for the station to be closed, and a week later, on 10 March 1975, the influential marketing/advertising industry journal ''[[B&amp;T]]'' followed suit, demanding that the station should be forced to undertake one of three options: (i) 2JJ should be closed down; (ii) 2JJ's programming should be completely revamped; or (iii) the removal of those staff responsible for "the present series of lapses".&lt;ref&gt;Elder &amp; Wales, op. cit., pp.8-11&lt;/ref&gt; Austin explained in 2005 that Webb was largely responsible for shielding the station from external criticism.&lt;ref name="Gay" /&gt;

The station rapidly gained popularity, especially with its target youth demographic: media articles noted that in its first two months on air, 2JJ reached a 5.4% share of the total radio audience, with 17% in the 18-24 age group, while the audience share of rival [[2SM]] dropped by 2.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/30years/gallery/2jj_1975.pdf |title=30 Years of Triple j |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the poor quality of reception caused by the Sydney transmitter, the station still saw rapid growth.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, 1995, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; Austin explained that station staff threatened industrial action in July 1975 due to the transmitter issues, but officials of the BCB still refused to meet with 2JJ representatives. A new transmitter was not provided until 1980, following the transition to the FM band.&lt;ref name="Gay" /&gt;

2JJ presenter [[George Wayne|George "Groover" Wayne]], who hosted the show ''Cooking with George'', became very popular, but was also part of the station's controversial reputation. Originally from South Africa, Wayne was fondly remembered by a listener for the 30-year anniversary event: "I remember George being booted off air. On night, reading the gig guide, he announced a fund raiser for NORML where the lucky door prize (or raffle) was a block of hash. I can't remember how long he was off air but he went home early that night." Former triple j DJ Ian Rogerson stated: "He had this fantastic voice and presence on air...He was just a great communicator...I really miss him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Double J presenter: George Wayne|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/30years/stories/s1304415.htm|work=triple j|publisher=ABC|accessdate=12 April 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy also emerged after the station hosted an open-air concert in Liverpool, in Sydney's south-west, in June 1975 (featuring Skyhooks and [[Dragon (band)|Dragon]]). A page-one headline&lt;ref&gt;''The Sun'', Sydney, 5 June 1975, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; in the Sydney ''Sun'' that read "Rock Concert Filth Uproar" introduced a story that claimed that many were "shocked" by "depictions of sexual depravity and shouted obscenities", which allegedly caused women in the audience to clap their hands over their ears, and reportedly prompted Coalition frontbencher Peter Nixon to call for the station to be closed down.&lt;ref&gt;Elder &amp; Wales, op.cit., p.36&lt;/ref&gt; The station regularly sponsored live concerts and organised a number of major outdoor concert events in the late 1970s, culminating in an outdoor, all-day event in [[Parramatta#Parks|Parramatta Park]], Sydney on 18 January 1981 to celebrate the end of Double J and the start of 2JJJ. Attended by 40,000 people, the historic concert featured [[Midnight Oil]] and [[Matt Finish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Matt Finish|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/matt-finish/|work=Matt Finish on MTV|publisher=Viacom International Inc|accessdate=12 April 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bootlegs|url=http://www.midnight-oil.info/discography/bootleg/10|work=Midnight Oil|publisher=Midnight Oil|accessdate=12 April 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s: 2JJJ===
On 1 August 1980 2JJ began broadcasting on the [[Frequency Modulation|FM]] band at a frequency of 105.7 [[Megahertz|MHz]] (again restricted to within the greater Sydney region) and became 2JJJ (later, '''Triple J''').&lt;ref name=JJJHist /&gt; Test transmissions in the lead-up to the FM launch used the innovative device of broadcasting stereo [[audio-verité]] recordings made by ABC staff, and, in a deliberate echo of the original Double Jay launch, the first song played on the new FM incarnation was another track then banned from commercial radio, "Gay Guys" by [[Dugites]]. Through the mid-to-late eighties, Triple J continued to pioneer new music and developed a wide range of special-interest programs including the [[J-Pop|Japanese pop]] show ''Nippi Rock Shop'', Arnold Frolows' weekly late-night ambient music show ''Ambience'', and [[Jaslyn Hall]]'s world music show, the first of its kind on Australian mainstream radio.

It was not until the late 1980s that the ABC was finally able to begin development of the long-delayed national "youth network". In 1989 JJJ expanded nationally to: [[Adelaide]], [[Brisbane]], [[Canberra]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Hobart]], [[Melbourne]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].

In 1983, four Triple J presenters — Peter Doyle, Virginia Moncrieff, [[Tony Barrell (broadcaster)|Tony Barrell]] and Clive Miller — began producing a fanzine with the inscrutable title of ''Alan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/30years/stories/alan.htm|title=30 years of triple j: ALAN zine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed in a manic collage style by [[David Art Wales]], ''Alan'' featured programming information, pop trivia, and irreverent interviews with recording artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/30years/stories/interview.htm|title=30 years of triple j|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wales also supplied a comic strip featuring a boy sage named Guru Adrian. In a twist that added to the character's appeal, the Guru's face was that of a real child whose identity was never revealed, leading many to believe that he was in fact a real guru. Guru Adrian's philosophy, "Adrianetics",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guruadrian.com|title=Guru Adrian: The Guru You Have When You're Not Having A Guru|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisted of quixotic maxims, including: "Having fun is half the fun," "Gee, you are you" and "Realise your real eyes," which rapidly gained the character a cult following in Australia, with Wales making many radio and television appearances during the mid-1980s to discuss the Guru Adrian phenomenon.

In 1984, Wales teamed with renowned Australian journalist Bruce Elder on the book ''Radio With Pictures: The History of Double Jay and Triple Jay''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/18764281?selectedversion=NBD3724942 NLA] Hale &amp; Iremonger, publishers. National Library of Australia card no. {{ISBN|0-86806-191-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1989–1991: Nationwide expansion===
In the late 1980s, Barry Chapman (Programme Director 2SM 1977–80, and Managing Director EMI Music Publishing 1983–89) was appointed as [[general manager]] to oversee Triple J's network expansion. His tenure, and the expansion of the network, generated controversy, most notably in 1990, when a large portion of 2JJJ's Sydney-based on air staff was fired, (the so-called "Night of the long knives") including the most popular presenters [[Tony Biggs]] and Tim Ritchie, the station's dance-music maven. As details of the changes became public, there were accusations of a "JJJ Bland Out" (analogous to [[Harry Enfield]]'s fictional British DJs [[Smashie and Nicey]]) and several protests were held outside its William Street studios. There was a public meeting that packed the Sydney Town Hall with angry listeners. The crowd spilled out onto the street as the hall was not big enough to hold everyone who felt that "their" beloved radio station had been hijacked.

Concern was expressed about the introduction of a more highly programmed music format, and the appointment of Chapman was seen as an indication of a more commercial direction. Management responded that to launch a national network meant that the station must broaden its then almost-exclusive focus on the Sydney music scene, requiring the addition of new talent. When the dispute waned, the [[radio programming]] was not nearly as free-form as it had been before going national, but neither was it as highly programmed as its critics feared. In the pre-national era, there had been less emphasis on a structured [[playlist]] but the introduction of a tighter playlist allowed (at least initially) a degree of input from individual presenters that exceeded that usually permitted on a commercial station.

The [[laissez-faire]] collective management style of the Double Jay days was gradually replaced by a more business-like [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] management style. Prior to the controversial appointment of Chapman, many of the 'old guard' were dismissed from the station and replaced by presenters who were more amenable to the increasingly structured format.

Chapman oversaw a radical overhaul of Triple J's programming and marketing. This basic format, though not dissimilar to the old Sydney based Triple J, included: an early morning comedy breakfast program with duo presenters, a late morning talk and talkback program, and a light talk-and-comedy afternoon drive-time shift. Decades later the format remains substantially in place. Compared to the late Seventies, Chapman did not reduce the amount of comedy, documentaries and news. Although as he did at 2SM, Chapman maintained and strengthened the station's commitment to live music.

In the late 1980s Triple J was accused of ignoring the emerging [[hip hop]] scene and related genres, in favour of the more marketable rock-oriented [[grunge]] style that dominated American music at the same time.

The amount of news comedy and documentaries remained essentially the same in the 1990s as it had during the 80's. The key changes were new programmes replacing old. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===1990s: Regional expansion===
[[File:Triplej logo.png|300px|thumb|The current Triple J logo]]
Throughout the 1990s, Triple J commenced expansion to more regional areas of Australia and, in 1994, it was extended to another 18 regional centres throughout the country. In 1996, the total was brought to 44, with the new additions including: [[Launceston, Tasmania]]; [[Albany, Western Australia]]; [[Bathurst, New South Wales]] and [[Mackay, Queensland]]. It played a record in Tas over and over again until Triple J came online. As of 2006, Triple J's most recent expansion was to [[Broome, Western Australia]].

===2000s: Online and jtv===
In May 2003, Arnold Frolows, the only remaining member of the original Double Jay staff of 1975, stepped down after 28 years as Triple J music director. He was replaced by presenter [[Richard Kingsmill]].

In 2004, the station began to release [[podcast]]s of some of its talkback shows, including ''[[Karl Kruszelnicki|Dr Karl]]'', ''[[This Sporting Life (radio program)|This Sporting Life]]'', and ''[[Hack (radio program)|Hack]]''.

In 2006, Triple J's coverage expanded when transmission began in [[Broome, Western Australia]]. As Broome was one of the largest towns in Australia to not receive Triple J to this point, the station celebrated with a concert featuring many local bands, also simulcast on the ''[[Live at the Wireless]]'' programme.

Also in 2006, Triple J launched [[Triple j tv|jtv]], a series of television programs broadcast on ABC and [[ABC2]], as well as being made available online. Programming included music videos, live concerts, documentaries, and comedy, as well as a behind-the-scenes look at Triple J's studios. In 2008 jtv was rebranded as Triple J TV. Triple J TV's first 'spin-off' series ''The Hack Half Hour'' premiered on 22 September 2008, hosted by [[Steve Cannane]].

As of February 2009 Triple J TV airs on 21:00 Mondays on ABC2, 11pm Fridays on ABC1 and can be downloaded at triplej.net.au. The series is hosted by The Doctor aka [[Lindsay McDougall]] and it features Hack reports from Antoinette Chiha, comedy from [[Sam Simmons (comedian)|Sam Simmons]], and the film segment ''Flicked'' with [[Marc Fennell]].

===2010s: Digital radio, Double J, Beat The Drum===
In 2014, ABC's Dig Music digital radio station joined the Triple J family and was re-launched as [[Double J (radio)|Double J]] on 30 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vincent|first=Peter|title=Double J launches with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds track|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/double-j-launches-with-nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds-track-20140430-37h7x.html|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitzsimons|first=Scott|title=Triple J's New Station Double J To Be Led By Myf Warhurst|url=http://themusic.com.au/news/all/2014/04/09/triple-j-new-station-double-j-to-be-lead-by-myf-warhurst/|work=TheMusic.com.au|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new station features both new music and material from Triple J interview and sound archives.&lt;ref name="s3981481" /&gt; Former Triple J announcer [[Myf Warhurst]], who hosted the inaugural shift, said  "it's for people who love music, and also love a bit of music history."&lt;ref name="s3981481"&gt;{{cite web|title=Double J is coming!|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s3981481.htm|work=Triple J|accessdate=9 April 2014|date=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station celebrated its 40th anniversary on 16 January 2015 with the seven-hour "Beat The Drum" event at the Domain venue in Sydney. Hosted by [[Peter Garrett]], an Australian musician with [[Midnight Oil]] and former federal Environment Minister, the list of performers, all of whom are the beneficiaries of the station's support, included: [[Hilltop Hoods]], [[The Presets]], [[The Cat Empire]], [[You Am I]], [[Daniel Johns]], [[Joelistics]], [[Ball Park Music]], [[Adalita]], [[Vance Joy]], and [[Gotye]]. The majority of performers played a combination of their own music and [[cover version]]s, including [[Sarah Blasko]] and [[Paul Dempsey]]'s rendition of [[Crowded House]]'s "Distant Sun", and [[The Preatures]] covering "At First Sight" by [[The Stems]] and [[The Divinyls]]' "All the Boys in Town".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Liz Giuffre|title=Review: celebrating 40 years of Triple J at Beat The Drum|url=http://theconversation.com/review-celebrating-40-years-of-triple-j-at-beat-the-drum-36414|accessdate=21 January 2015|work=The Conversation|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ratings released in August 2015, Triple J was the highest or equal first in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth in the 25-39 demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/triple-j-beats-fox-nova-and-mmm-to-win-radio-ratings-for-2539-age-bracket-20150828-gj9t0s.html|title=Triple J beats Fox, Nova and MMM to win radio ratings for 25-39 age bracket|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
[[File:Triple J Come Together.jpg|thumb|right|Bands playing at Triple J's "Come Together" festival.]]

===Current programming mix===
Triple J frequently features new, alternative music and local Australian performers, and programming which used to show a bias against [[bubblegum pop]] and [[top 40]] hits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/triple-j-hottest-100-contenders-the-most-played-songs-of-2014-20150120-12tdse.html|title=Triple J Hottest 100 contenders: The most played songs of 2014|author=Michael Koziol|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/triple-j-throws-beat-the-drum-party-in-the-park-to-celebrate-four-decades-of-alternative-australian-music/story-e6frfn09-1227187543062|title=Triple J Beat the Drum 40th birthday party goes off in Sydney|work=NewsComAu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/is-triple-j-still-relevant-20150115-12nww5.html|title=Is Triple J still relevant?|author=Peter Vincent|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triple J has nightly specialist programs in different musical genres (see the programmes section below). It also covers news and [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] from a youth-oriented perspective, although this facet of its programming has been reduced considerably since the station's inception.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In common with other Australian radio stations, Triple J has also gradually increased the amount of [[talk radio|talkback]] content in its programming. There are several reasons for this. Most importantly, it provides an inexpensive and popular source of program content, and also provides the appearance of listener interactivity and involvement. Like many other former 'all music' stations, Triple J has had to respond to the advent of music file-sharing, digital music players, and other digital music innovations, which have drastically reduced listeners' dependence on radio as a means of accessing music.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Evolution of programming===
The evolution of Triple J's programming has always been contentious. In the Double Jay days, commercial stations and conservatives regularly cried foul over the station's free use of [[Profanity|expletives]] on air and its ability to ignore the censorship restrictions that were in force for commercial radio. This situation stemmed from Double Jay's status as a special unit of the ABC which, at that time, was only answerable to the ABC Board and the Minister for Communications, unlike the commercial stations, which were subject to regulation by the old Broadcasting Control Board (now the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]]) and by their own peak body, the Federation of Australian Commercial Broadcasters (FACB), now known as [[Commercial Radio Australia]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Over the years the station gained considerable renown for breaking new local acts. Midnight Oil, the prime example of this, would almost certainly not have had the success they enjoyed without the help of Double Jay/Triple J.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} The station also broke countless overseas acts who were being ignored in their home countries. Double Jay was virtually the only 'pop' station in Australia in the late Seventies to play: [[reggae]], [[dub music|dub]], [[punk rock]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[world music]], [[electronic music]], and [[ambient music]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Over the years the station moved away from its early style, which featured a high level of news, features, documentaries, current affairs, and comedy, and was gradually steered towards a non-commercial version of the continuous music format that prevailed in commercial radio. Many original Double Jay segments including the nightly "What's On" gig guide, its extensive news and current affairs coverage (which was often criticised for its alleged left-wing bias), and its 'community noticeboard' segment, were gradually eliminated, as were almost all the character comedy spots that had been popular features in previous years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Most recently the number of songs approved for airplay on Triple J has been decreased dramatically, leading some to believe that an over-emphasis on certain styles of music, particularly electro and dance, has had a negative effect on the formerly unbiased genre programming. It is also said that this has affected the cultivation of musical diversity on the ''Unearthed'' program.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Effects on local record companies and radio stations===
The station also exerted a noticeable effect on local record companies. For many years, local record labels would only import recordings that they knew would earn a good commercial return, and they were often unwilling to take risks on local releases of unknown acts. Much new music was routinely available only as expensive imports in specialist shops. This began to change almost as soon as Double Jay came on air. A good example of the station's influence was in 1976 when Double Jay championed a new album, ''[[801 (band)|801]] Live'', recorded by a one-off group that included former [[Roxy Music]] members [[Phil Manzanera]] and [[Brian Eno]]. Although the LP was hailed overseas as one of the best live recordings ever made, and set new standards of technical excellence, the Australian distributor at first refused to release it locally, in spite of the fact that it was one of the most requested items on the Double Jay playlist at the time. As a result of the import sales that were generated by Double Jay airplay — it became the highest selling import album that year — the company decided to release it locally.

Triple J routinely championed many local and overseas acts whose early recordings were ignored by commercial radio including: Midnight Oil, [[Models (band)|Models]], [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]], [[The Clash]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[Public Image Ltd]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Foo Fighters (band)|Foo Fighters]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], [[Ben Folds Five]], and hundreds more. As with the ABC's long-running pop TV show ''[[Countdown (music show)|Countdown]]'', the support of Triple J in Australia also had a strong effect on the success of emerging overseas acts. A case in point is American group [[The B-52's]]. It is believed that Double Jay was the first radio station in the world to play their debut single "Rock Lobster". The support of Double Jay/Triple J had a similarly significant effect on the worldwide success of many acts, including: [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Devo]], and more recently [[Ben Folds Five]], [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]], and especially [[Ben Harper]], whose popularity in Australia, which was almost entirely the result of support from Triple J, was instrumental in breaking him back in his home country, the United States.

It is also notable that Triple J was for many years routinely used as a free [[market research]] facility by commercial stations. As mainstream pop radio struggled to establish itself on the FM band, commercial stations like those owned by [[Austereo Radio Network|Austereo]] constantly monitored what songs and acts were doing well on Triple J and would then introduce the most 'saleable' of them into their own playlists. Acts like [[Talking Heads]], [[The Police]], and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] unquestionably owed their commercial success in Australia to the early support of Double Jay/Triple J.

In 1989, Triple J had been playing [[N.W.A]]'s protest song "[[Fuck tha Police]]" for up to six months, before catching the attention of ABC management who subsequently banned it. As a result, the staff went on strike and put the group's song "[[Express Yourself (N.W.A song)|Express Yourself]]" on continuous play for 24 hours, playing it roughly 360 times in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/30years/stories/s1286179.htm|title=Censorship and NWA's Fuck the Police|last=|first=|date=|work=Triple J|publisher=[[abc.net.au]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405080054/http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/30years/stories/s1286179.htm|archive-date=5 April 2016|dead-url=|accessdate=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/express-yourself-the-day-triple-j-played-the-same-nwa-song-82-times-in-a-row-20150902-gjdk0d.html|title=Express yourself: The day Triple J played the same N.W.A. song 82 times in a row|last=Chamberlin|first=Paul|last2=Casimir|first2=Jon|date=2 September 2015|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|orig-year=1990-05-08|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, when launching [[Double J (radio)|Double J]] on digital radio, the station played nothing but "Express Yourself" for 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tonedeaf.com.au/double-j-is-playing-the-same-song-on-repeat/|title=Triple J's New Station Double J Is Playing The Same Song On Repeat|last=Newstead|first=Al|date=29 April 2014|work=Tone Deaf|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://doublej.net.au/news/music-news/express-yourself-why-dig-music-playing-same-song-over-and-over|title=Express Yourself: Why Is Dig Music Playing The Same Song Over And Over? {{!}} Double J|last=|first=|date=28 April 2014|work=Double J|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===

====Speciality music shows====
Triple J programming schedule has included shows featuring many specialty genres including: ''{{CURRENTYEAR}}''  featuring new music - the show started in 1997 and changes its name to match the current year; ''[[The Racket (radio program)|The Racket]]'' features [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] - formerly ''Full Metal Racket'' and ''3 Hours of Power''; ''[[Hip Hop Show]]''; ''Home &amp; Hosed'' Triple J's Australian music show; ''[[Mix Up (radio show)|Mix Up]]'' featuring [[DJ|DJ mixes]]; ''Radio Funktrust'' playing [[groove (music)|groove]] and [[funk]] - formerly ''The Groove Train''; ''[[Roots N All]]'' with [[roots reggae|roots]] and [[blues]]; ''[[short.fast.loud]]'' featuring [[punk rock]], [[hardcore punk]], [[metalcore]], and [[post-hardcore]]; ''The Club'' with [[Electronic music|dance]]; and ''The Sound Lab'' featuring [[experimental music|experimental]], [[Intelligent Dance Music|IDM]], [[post-rock]], [[minimal techno]], [[dubstep]], [[ambient music|ambient]], and [[glitch music|glitch]].

====''J-Files''====
The weekly ''J-Files'' show has had two incarnations over the years. From 1996 to 2003, it was a three-hour late weeknight show hosted by [[Richard Kingsmill]]. Each show was topical; it might feature an artist, a particular year in the past, or songs with a certain theme. Examples of themed shows include: ''[[9 (number)|#9]] songs'' (which was the theme of 9 September 1999's show), ''[[cat]]s &amp; [[dog]]s'', ''[[New Zealand]] bands'', and ''[[censorship|banned]] songs''.

From 2003 the ''J-Files'' was a one-hour Saturday afternoon show, hosted by various Triple J presenters, specifically focused on one particular artist. The final J-File was aired in November 2007. On Thursday 21 August 2014 the ''J Files'' made its debut on digital station [[Double J (radio)|Double J]].

In 2018, [[Gemma Pike]] was announced as the second ever permanent host of The J Files.

====''Live at the Wireless''====
{{main|Live at the Wireless}}
''Live at the Wireless'' is a long-standing tradition of Triple J. It is a weekly broadcast of live music, of a number of forms - open air festivals, smaller concerts, or acoustic performances in the studio. Occasionally, Triple J will host a live performance in a secret location, and give away tickets to a limited number of listeners, to allow them to be a part of the special event.

====''Home &amp; Hosed''====
Up until 2002, the ''Australian Music Show'' was Triple J's all-Australian music segment, broadcast as a three-hour late weeknight show (22:00 to 01:00) and hosted by [[Richard Kingsmill]]. Starting in 2003, the format changed to a two-hour show every weeknight (21:00 to 23:00, shortening ''Super Request'' and the late night speciality shows by an hour each) and [[Robbie Buck]] became the presenter. It proved to be one of Triple J's most popular changes, as the audience (and the station itself) has traditionally been very supportive of local talent and unsigned bands. The show has now been reduced to one hour, is only on Monday to Thursdays, and is hosted by Declan Byrne; who replaced Dom Allesio for 2018.{{Citation needed|reason=Changing of host requires a reliable source|date=September 2018}}

====''House Party''====
On 2 February 2008, Triple J commenced broadcasting a house-party style programme mixed and presented by [[Nina Las Vegas]].
In July 2011, while Nina Las Vegas was on vacation, [[Ballarat]] mashup duo Yacht Club DJs hosted ''House Party'' for the entire month. The show is currently hosted by Kristy Lee Peters.&lt;ref name="JJJPG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/guide/week.htm|title=Guide by Week|publisher=ABC|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comedy===

====''The Breakfast Show''====
[[File:Robbie Buck of Triple J.jpg|thumb|right|Robbie Buck in the Triple J studio]]
The Breakfast Show is one of the station's flagship shows. In the late '80s it was hosted by Rusty Nails, and later by resident "dag", [[Maynard (Australian media personality)|Maynard F# Crabbes]]. In the early 1990s it was co-hosted by [[Helen Razer]] and [[Mikey Robins]], and later by [[Mikey Robins]], [[Paul McDermott (comedian)|Paul McDermott]], and The Sandman ([[Steve Abbott (comedian)|Steve Abbott]]). From 1999 until 2004, it was co-hosted by [[Adam Spencer]] and [[Wil Anderson]]. The pair were known for their unusual sense of humour, highlighted by regular segments including ''Mary from Junee'', ''Essence of Steve'', and ''Are You Smarter Than Dools?''. ''The Breakfast Show'' also featured two radio serials presented by The Sandman: "Pleasant Avenue" and "204 Bell St".&lt;ref&gt;Sandman (2000). ''204 Bell St: A guide to sharehouse living''. Sydney: ABC Books for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. {{ISBN|0-7333-0905-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spencer and Anderson broadcast their final program for the station on Friday 26 November 2004 from [[Sydney University]]'s Manning Bar, a site that held sentimental value to Spencer, as that was where he got his start in stand-up comedy. In 2005, [[Jay and the Doctor|Jay and Lindsay (aka 'The Doctor')]] from [[Frenzal Rhomb]] took over as hosts of Triple J's breakfast show. New segments include the radio skits ''Space Goat'' and ''Battalion 666'', as well as the ''Under the Weather Sessions'' and ''The Friday Fuckwit''. From 8 January 2007, former Lunch presenter [[Myf Warhurst]] joined Jay and Lindsay as a permanent member of the Breakfast Show team. [[Henry Stone (Comedian)]] contributed to the Triple J Debate Night series in 2013.

Following the departure of Jay (who left to travel), the 2008-2009 Breakfast Show line up was [[Robbie Buck]], The Doctor, and [[Marieke Hardy]]. They regularly maintained contact with Jay during his overseas travel, calling him during a segment named ''Where in the World is Jason "Jay" Whalley'', a pun on [[Where's Wally?]] and [[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?]].

In 2009, Robbie, Marieke, and The Doctor had a serial called "Claytron". Tuesdays offered "Nerds of a Feather" with [[Paul Verhoeven (Australia)|Paul Verhoeven]], whilst Friday offered "The Friday Fuckwit" as well as "Like a Version", a segment where famous recording artists perform a cover version of a song of their choice.

[[File:Alex_Dyson_and_Matt_Okine_at_Tropfest_Australia_2013.jpg|thumb|right|Alex Dyson (left) and Matt Okine (right) at [[Tropfest]] 2013]]
On 23 November 2009, it was announced that [[Tom Ballard]] and [[Alex Dyson]] (hosts of the 2009 Weekend Breakfast show) would take over as hosts of the 2010 Breakfast show. In December 2013, Tom Ballard resigned and was replaced by [[Matt Okine]] in January 2014.  "Like a Version" has continued with Okine and Dyson.

Okine and Dyson hosted the annual ''Matt &amp; Alex Legend of the Year Awards'' from 2014-2016, presenting awards including Crumb of the Year to [[Richard Wilkins (TV presenter)|Richard Wilkins]], and Legend of the Year to: Mark from [[Cromer, New South Wales|Cromer]], Tuesday [[rave]] advocate;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/breakfast/blog/s4199088.htm |title = Matt and Alex's Legend Of The Year 2015 |accessdate = 2016-12-16 |date = 2015-03-17 |publisher = Triple J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Niamh from [[Hobart]], [[Live radio|live]] professor of love;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/breakfast/blog/s4367036.htm |title = Matt and Alex Legend Of The Year Awards |accessdate = 2016-12-16 |date = 2015-12-07 |publisher = Triple J }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dave '[[Carpet|Ruggsy]]' Rugs, former ''[[Hey Hey It's Saturday]]'' contestant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/breakfast/blog/s4592837.htm |title = The Matt &amp; Alex Legend of The Year Award goes to... |accessdate = 2016-12-16 |date = 2016-12-15 |publisher = Triple J }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2016, it was announced that Okine and Dyson will leave triple j to travel and pursue other opportunities. Their last show was broadcast on 16 December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4579545.htm|title=A fond farewell to some triple j legends - Music News - triple j|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2017 the Breakfast team consists of former Adelaide community radio presenters and comedians Ben Harvey and Liam Stapleton, with current affairs from journalist Brooke Boney. Paralympian [[Dylan Alcott]] and comedian Gen Fricker are slated to be regular guests.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4579482.htm|title=Here's your triple j 2017 weekday line-up - Music News - triple j|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


====''Weekend Breakfast''====
Past presenters have included Jim Trail, Paul Verhoeven, [[Costa Zouliou]], [[Gaby Brown]], [[Scott Dooley]], and [[Sam Simmons (comedian)|Sam Simmons]]. [[Caroline Tran]] returned in 2010. The very popular ''[[Club Veg]]'', featured Malcolm Lees and Vic Davies, from 1984 to 1986. They then moved to [[2SM]] &amp; [[Triple M]]. Weekend breakfast is now hosted by Stacy Gougoulis.&lt;ref name="JJJPG"/&gt;

====''This Sporting Life''====
{{main|This Sporting Life (radio program)}}
''This Sporting Life'' (TSL), which ran from 1986 to 2008, was a parody of sporting panel programs, created and hosted by actor-writer-comedians [[John Doyle (comedian)|John Doyle]] and [[Greig Pickhaver]] (under the pseudonyms [[Roy &amp; HG|Roy Slaven &amp; HG Nelson]]). As well as sport, the duo cast a wide comedic net that encompassed the worlds of entertainment, politics and celebrity. ''TSL'' was remarkable as one of the few successful comedy programs that was substantially improvised.

The longest-running show in Triple J's programming history, ''TSL'' commanded a large and dedicated nationwide audience. Special editions of ''TSL'' were broadcast to coincide with the [[National Rugby League|NRL]] and [[Australian Football League|AFL]] [[grand final]]s (''The Festival of the Boot'') as well as for all three of rugby league's [[State of Origin series]] matches. (see [[Roy and HG's State of Origin commentary]]). In 2009, after 22 years at the ABC, the duo left to work for the commercial rock station [[Triple M]].

In 2012 [[Roy &amp; HG|Roy Slaven &amp; HG Nelson]]'s ''The Festival of the Boot'' returned to an ABC Radio station for the first time since 2009. To date all 3 [[Australian Football League|AFL]] [[grand final]]s (labeled "Part 1") &amp; all 3 [[National Rugby League|NRL]] [[grand final]]s (labeled "Part 2") have been broadcast on '''ABC News Radio'''

====''Raw Comedy Competition''====
{{main|Raw Comedy}}
Triple J supports, promotes and broadcasts clips from the [[Raw Comedy]] Competition, which is produced by the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]]. Podcasts of competition sets are available via the Triple J website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/rawcomedy/podcast/podcast.xml |title=Triple J: Raw Comedy |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Restoring the Balance''====
{{main|Restoring the Balance}}

''Restoring the Balance'' was broadcast sporadically on Sunday afternoons during 2004. The primary concept behind the show was a satire of the contrasting political views between the conservative Australian [[John Howard|Howard government]], and the [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] government-funded Triple J radio station. The show suggested that the station was forced to broadcast a segment of [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] political views in order to ''restore the balance''.

====''Ross and Terri''====

''Ross and Terri'' broadcast weekdays at lunch times, for two 2-week periods, over summer 2005 and 2006. It was hosted by [[Ross Noble]] and [[Terri Psiakis]]. It was initially a filler show, but the popularity of the pair was enough to bring them back in 2006.

====''Today Today''====
{{main|Today Today}}
''Today Today'' was the name given to the drive show in 2004 and 2005, hosted by [[The Chaser|Chaser]] members [[Chris Taylor (comedian)|Chris Taylor]] and [[Craig Reucassel]]. The show's name was derived from ''[[Today Tonight]]'', a controversial Australian TV current affairs show screened on the [[Seven Network]]. Their humour was in a similar vein to ''[[CNNNN]]'' and ''[[The Chaser (newspaper)|The Chaser]]'', being more politically driven. One of their more popular skits was "Coma FM", a parody of commercial radio stations.

====''Radio plays''====
Triple J currently has had several comedic [[radio drama|radio plays]]:
* ''Coma FM'' - satirical radio station performed by ''Today Today'' hosts Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel.
* ''Space Goat'' - a parody radio [[Science fiction|sci fi]] performed by the breakfast show's [[Jay and the Doctor]] which borrowed many features of early radio science fictions such as a long intro for very little story which leaves many questions open, which the narrator spends some time pointing out at the end.
* ''Battalion 666'' - a comedic radio drama which takes place on a fictional [[Royal Navy]] ship, HMS ''Beezlebub''. It came about when, in 2004, the Royal Navy officially recognised [[LaVeyan Satanism]] as an official religion in which its personnel can partake. The show features [[Jay and the Doctor]], [[John Safran]], and various sound clips of famous people taken from recorded interviews such as [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Russell Crowe]].

====''Saturday Night / Graveyard Shift''====
In 2005 [[Dave Callan]] started at Triple J presenting the Saturday night/Sunday early morning program the ''Graveyard Shift''.

In 2006 Dave hosted the Saturday evening timeslot, called ''Saturday Night''. The show followed the pattern of Callan's mid-dawn shifts from previous years. In January 2007 this show was renamed ''Pirate Radio'' after one of the personae commonly adopted by callers. Listener interaction plays a significant role in Callan's programmes with regular callers such as "Steph from Tamworth", "Snake Charmer Farmer", and "Ukulele Guy", as well as an assortment of "randoms" and "carnies". On 27 January 2008, Dave returned to the ''Graveyard Shift'' (01:00-06:00 Sunday mornings). From January 2009 the show was shortened, finishing at 04:00. As of 2011 Dave is no longer on Triple J.

====''Sunday Night Safran''====
{{main|Sunday Night Safran}}
Beginning in 2005, [[John Safran]] and [[Bob Maguire|Father Bob Maguire]] have co-hosted a Sunday night talk show interviewing international guests, generally discussing serious topics like religion and politics. The show is no longer on air.&lt;ref name="JJJPG"/&gt;

====''The Race Race''====
Beginning on 27 October 2008, Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel co-hosted a comedy program centred on the [[2008 US Presidential Election]] entitled ''The Race Race''. The programme aired at 17:00 weekdays until the wrap-up episode, which aired on 5 November 2008, after the elections had concluded.

The program derived its name from the fact that [[Barack Obama]], the first African–American to be nominated by a major American political party for president, was running a formerly exclusively white political race against the white Republican candidate, [[John McCain]]. The program became the number one podcast in Australia, and Triple J released a number of commemorative Race Race T-shirts which featured the show's catchphrase "[[I like pie|I Like Pie]]".

===Hottest 100===
{{main|Triple J Hottest 100}}
The Hottest 100 is an annual [[opinion poll|poll]] of the previous year's most popular songs, as voted by its listeners. It has been conducted for over two decades in its present form, and in 2016 attracted 2.26&amp;nbsp;million votes from 172 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/aussie-duo-takes-out-hottest-100-honours/story-e6frfn0r-1225995096019|title=Angus and Julia Stone top hottest 100|publisher=[[News.com.au]]|date=27 January 2011|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.com.au"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/local-talent-the-pick-in-triple-js-top-100/2006/01/26/1138066921989.html|title=Local talent the pick in Triple J's top 100|publisher=[[The Age]]|date=27 January 2006|accessdate=14 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is promoted as the "world's greatest music democracy" and has also spawned a series of [[compilation album|compilation]] CDs, and more recently, music [[DVD]]s, released via [[ABC Music]]. The countdown of the poll had regularly taken place on [[Australia Day]] from 1998 to 2017.&lt;ref name="news.com.au" /&gt;  In response to controversy surrounding Australia Day celebrations and an extensive poll of Triple J listeners, it was announced in November 2017 that future countdowns would be aired on the fourth weekend of January to avoid associations with the Australia Day holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/musicnews/triple-j-hottest-100-is-moving-to-a-new-date-and-heres-why/9197254|title=Hottest 100's new date|date=27 November 2017|work=triple j|access-date=21 January 2018|others=Words by triple j}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unearthed===
{{main|Triple J Unearthed}}

Unearthed, an ongoing project to find hidden talent, began in 1995. It originally focused on regional areas but now covers all of Australia. Many of these discoveries have been very successful. Some, such as [[Grinspoon]], [[Killing Heidi]], and [[Missy Higgins]], have even been successful enough to receive commercial radio airplay.

The Unearthed competition was inspired by the success of a talent search on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] program ''Nomad'' called "Pick Me". This segment, co-produced by Triple J, discovered a trio from [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] called the "Innocent Criminals", who later gained international fame under the name [[Silverchair]].

The most recent incarnation of ''Unearthed'' is run online, and allows listeners to rate and review songs uploaded by bands and musicians.

Some on-air promotions for the first volume were recorded at the Triple J studios in Ultimo by Darren McErlain in 1996. He was invited to record voice-overs for Triple J, whilst completing an internship at ABC Radio News.

On 5 October 2011 [[Triple J Unearthed]] was launched as a radio station available on [[Digital radio in Australia|digital radio]] and online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Triple J Launches Aus-Only Digital Channel|url=http://www.messandnoise.com/news/4318256|work=Mess+Noise|date=25 August 2011|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beat the Drum===
Triple J occasionally runs a competition known as 'Beat the Drum' - named for their logo of three drumsticks hitting a drum. It is a competition designed to promote the logo, whereby, whoever displays it in the most prominent place would win a prize. Notable entries include:
* A girl who distributed postcards of herself with the Triple J logo painted on her naked buttocks
* A Triple J T-shirt being waved behind the final lap of, and the presentation of a [[gold medal]] for [[Kieren Perkins]]' victorious 1500&amp;nbsp;m swim at, the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Atlanta Olympics]]
* One of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]] opening ceremony participants wearing a Triple J T-shirt bearing the logo
* The placement of a large Triple J logo on the musicians' platform at the closing ceremony of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]].
* The winner in 2000 who drove his car, converted into a large 3D drum logo, across Australia.
* A group of people erecting [[road signs]] with the Triple J frequency all the way up the east coast of Australia
* A farmer in Queensland who formed a drum logo shaped [[crop circle]] measuring 1 by 1.5&amp;nbsp;km in his wheat-fields. This entry won in the individual/small group category in 2004.
* Students from the [[University of Tasmania]]'s [[Hobart]] Campus stripping down to their underwear and painting themselves red to form the logo on the university's football oval which was then aerially photographed.

In late 2004, the station's promotion for that year's Beat the Drum contest caused a brief but bitter controversy after it released a series of promotional images featuring the 'Drum' logo. Many were outraged by the inclusion of a [http://img165.imageshack.us/img165/606/triplejcontroversialphotoki2.jpg mocked-up image] of the former [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] draped with a huge Drum flag.

In 2015 no "One Night Stand" was held. Instead "[[Triple J#Beat the Drum|Beat The Drum]]" was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/events/beatthedrum/concert/blog/default.htm|title=Blog - Beat the Drum - triple j|date=11 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To commemorate the 40th anniversary of Triple J a one-off concert was held on January 16 at [[The Domain, Sydney]].  Artists included: [[Ball Park Music]], [[Vance Joy]], [[The Preatures]], [[You Am I]], [[The Cat Empire]], [[The Presets]], [[Hilltop Hoods]], and many special guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4159826.htm|title=Beat The Drum set times and map announced - Music News - triple j|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impossible Music Festival===
{{main|Triple J's Impossible Music Festival}}

The ''Impossible Music Festival'', broadcast in August 2005 was a celebration of 30 years of live music recordings made by JJ and Triple J. Voted for by listeners from over 1000 recorded gigs/concerts, the broadcast went from 18:00 Friday the 26th to 01:00 Monday the 29th. The 2006 ''Impossible Music Festival'' was aired on the weekend of 7–8 October. The 2007 ''Impossible Music Festival'' broadcast from Friday 25 May to Sunday 27 May. The 2008 ''Impossible Music Festival'' was broadcast from Friday 19 September until Sunday 21 September.

===Triple J's One Night Stand===
{{main|Triple J's One Night Stand}}

The ''One Night Stand'', held annually since 2004, offers a small town the opportunity to host a free, all ages concert, sponsored by Triple J, featuring three or four Australian musical acts. Entries must include examples of local support, including community (signatures), local government (council approval), and a venue for the concert.

===Ausmusic Month===
Each November on Triple J is Ausmusic month, where Australian artists are heavily promoted. This includes a solid weekend of Australian music; some free, limited-entry concerts around the country; All-Australian feature albums; Live at the Wireless; and each day, a new "unknown" Australian band is featured and played several times during the day.

===J Awards===
{{main|J Award}}

The [[J Awards]] are an annual awards ceremony held at the start of December each year to celebrate [[Australian music]]. Awards include; the Unearthed [[J Award]] for best Unearthed artist, the [[J Award]] for [[Australia]]n [[Music Video]] of the year, and the main J Award for [[Australia]]n [[album]] of the year, judged by a panel of Triple J presenters. Past winners of the [[J Award]] include; [[Wolfmother]] (2005), [[Hilltop Hoods]] (2006), and [[The Panics]] (2007).

==Presenters==
{{main|List of Triple J presenters}}
Many Double Jay and early Triple J presenters went on to successful careers with commercial stations, the most notable being [[Doug Mulray]], who honed his distinctive comedy-based style at the Jays before moving to rival FM rock station 2-MMM ([[Triple M]]) in the 1980s, where he became the most popular breakfast presenter in Sydney (and one of the highest-paid radio personalities in the country). Presenter [[Annette Shun Wah]] went on to host the popular ''Rock Around the World'' series on SBS and is now a program executive with SBS TV and producer of ''[[The Movie Show]]''.

==Game development industry==
[[File:Tong-Its_Game_2003_Screenshot.jpg|thumb|[[Tong-its]] game released in November 2003 by Rico Zuñiga]]
The Philippines is a minor player regarding the game development industry. In 2011, it was reported that the local industry only has a 0.02% market share of the $90 billion global industry. The majority of the game development industry is focused on [[outsourcing]] to foreign companies rather than creation of local content.&lt;ref name=presentfuture&gt;{{cite news|title=Game on: the present and future of game development in the Philippines|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/242660/scitech/technology/game-on-the-present-and-future-of-game-development-in-the-philippines|accessdate=15 November 2015|publisher=GMA News|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Game Developers Association of the Philippines (GDAP), there are about 4,000 professionals representing about 60 companies involved in the game development industry as of 2013. The Philippines' primary competitors in this field are [[China]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Game development industry booming in PHL, says GDAP|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/290814/scitech/technology/game-development-industry-booming-in-phl-says-gdap|accessdate=15 November 2015|publisher=GMA News|date=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and issues==

===1981 ban on video games===
On November 19, 1981 President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] banned video games in the country through a presidential decree, making the Philippines the first nation to ban video games. The decree was [[Moral panic|a response]] to complaints from parents and educators who alleged that games such as ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' were [[Think of the children#Censorship|detrimental]] to youth morals, viewing them as a "destructive social enemy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=President Marcos bans video game machines|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/10056192/?terms=marcos+video+games|newspaper=Logansport Pharos-Tribune|date=19 November 1981|page=17|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = February 26, 2015 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and existing "to the detriment of the public interest".&lt;ref name="PD519"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://source.gosupra.com/docs/provision/78753|title=Presidential Decree No. 519 - Supra Source|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillon|first=Roberto|title=The Golden Age of Video Games: The Birth of a Multibillion Dollar Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1439873232|date=12 April 2011|publisher=CRC Press|location=Page xvii|isbn=1439873232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcos also decreed the ban of [[pinball]] machines, slot machines, and other similar gaming devices. Filipinos were given two weeks to either destroy their video games and devices or surrender the materials to the police and army. Violators had to pay a fine amounting to about $600 and face 6 months to 1 year of prison. Playing video games in the country went underground. The ban was effectively lifted following the [[1986 People Power Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcos Bans Video Games|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/20/world/marcos-bans-video-games.html|accessdate=15 November 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=19 November 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippine President Bans Videogames|url=http://www.historychannel.com.au/classroom/day-in-history/950/philippine-president-bans-videogames|accessdate=15 November 2015|work=History Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dillon|first1=Roberto|title=The Golden Age of Video Games: The Birth of a Multibillion Dollar Industry|date=2011|publisher=A K Peters/CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=1439873232|page=xvii|edition=illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pq6-X1fTm2oC&amp;lpg=PR17&amp;ots=oRwSwuTw71&amp;dq=marcos%20bans%20video%20games&amp;pg=PR17#v=onepage&amp;q=marcos%20bans%20video%20games&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 November 2015|chapter=Timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Localized ban on ''Defense of the Ancients''===
While no video games have been banned nationwide since 1986, at least one title, ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'', has been banned at a [[barangay]] in [[Dasmariñas, Cavite]] following complaints of [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]] and two murder incidents involving youths in the area resulting from brawls related to the game.&lt;ref name="DOTABan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/413042/news/regions/dota-banned-in-internet-shops-in-cavite-village|title=DOTA banned in internet shops in Cavite village|date=21 January 2015|work=[[GMA News]]|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright infringement===
[[Copyright infringement|Unauthorized distribution]] of video games is a complex issue in the Philippines. Despite legislation against copyright violation, enforcement and cultural factors remain an obstacle in the country. Bootleg video games, along with [[warez]], contribute to the [[underground economy]] of the country where video gaming is a popular form of entertainment among Filipino families. The inability of many Filipino families to afford video game software and hardware at legitimate prices leads them to turn to unlicensed goods. The [[Optical Media Board]] in cooperation with the police enforces intellectual rights law in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vitale|first1=Jennifer Kim|title=Video Game Piracy in the Philippines: A Narrowly Tailored Analysis of the Video Game Industry &amp; Subculture|journal=Pace International Law Review|date=January 2010|volume=22|issue=1 Winter 2010|url=http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1032&amp;context=pilr|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
