INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN as a sculptor, American artist Abbott Pattison worked primarily in cast bronze, welded brass and carved marble. Recognition of his talent first came in his hometown of Chicago through representation by the Fairweather-Hardin Gallery, but his reputation soon spread nationally, with eight one-man exhibits in New York City at The Downtown Gallery and Edith Halpern Gallery. Later he was also represented in Los Angeles by The Feingarten Gallery, and in London by The Alwin Gallery.

Abbott Pattison was born May 15, 1916 to William and Bonnie Pattison, the second of seven children. His father was a well-known real estate developer of the city. He first attended art classes at The Art Institute of Chicago at the age of 10, while a student of Francis Parker School. Later he chose to enroll at Yale University because of their art program. While there, he was thoroughly trained in classical traditions of drawing, fresco painting and the Sienese style of egg tempera, eventually choosing sculpture as his primary art form.

After he graduated with a Liberal Arts Degree in 1937, he enrolled in the Master’s program at Yale, and graduated with a Degree in Fine Arts in 1939.  Among the fifty-two students who graduated from the art/architecture department that year, Pattison was awarded first prize, which was a traveling fellowship, and he chose to travel to Northern China and Japan for six months. While in China, he lived in a mountain village 150 miles from Peking with a Franciscan priest who was building a Catholic church in stone quarried from a nearby mountain, Pattison carved Twelve Stations of the Cross for the monastery with the assistance of several local stone masons. Next traveling in Japan, Abbott Pattison was arrested as a spy, but soon released. He warned his interrogators that he would return to Japan, but the next time he would be wearing a uniform.

Upon his return to The United States in 1940, Pattison went directly into Officer’s Training School. From 1942 to 1945, he was given active command as Captain of a Pacific Command Sub Chaser, doing convoy duty between Hawaii and the Midway Islands. He was promoted to First Executive Officer on a Destroyer Escort, and was thereafter given full command as Captain of a second Destroyer Escort, running convoys across the Pacific from Florida to the African Coast and into the Mediterranean. He won a Military Merit medal for personal bravery, and his ship received battle stars for downing several German fighter planes. Pattison noted that the only regular paycheck he ever received was from that time when he served as an officer in the United States Navy. 

At the end of World War II, Abbott Pattison returned to Chicago, and to his art, so that by 1946 he was well-known in art circles as the youthful recipient of both the Logan and Eisendrath awards, and as a recipient of one of the four prizes awarded nationally to sculptors by The Metropolitan Museum. He joined the faculty of The Art Institute of Chicago as an instructor of sculpture.

You can show a young student how to acquire the two-percent of sculpture but the rest is up to him….only the talent within can make him a sculptor. And in most cases, only long, hard work over a period of years will unleash all of the potential talent within a man.''

In 1953, Pattison was a visiting sculptor at The University of Georgia, and was asked to return the following year as a sculptor in residence with no teaching duties, having been honored for a second time with the Pauline Palmer Prize for sculpture. At the University, Pattison carved a large marble sculpture, titled Mother and Child and went on to create a 12-foot high abstract horse for the campus in welded plate steel, now called familiarly The Iron Horse. At the time, this sculpture represented the cutting-edge of avant-garde art in the United States. The sculpture was placed in front of the dormitory of the University’s football team, and angry students attacked the horse with spray paint, manure, fire and hammers, with the art department professors merely looking on. The Athens, Georgia police force was called in to quell the disturbance. This event became famous as the first official riot on an American college campus, and became the feature of a Public Broadcasting System movie special. The quarter-inch thick boiler plate steel sculpture withstood the attack and remains intact, but it was immediately removed from the campus and has never returned, sitting in a local farmer’s field since 1954.

Abbott Pattison regarded all sculptors, presently living or throughout time, as his kin. His work was inspired by classical Classical Greek and Etruscan forms, elements of which he interpreted in creating his abstract bronzes, welded braised figures, and marble carvings.


{{Quote box
 |quote  = ''We sculptors have elements in our work that pass from one generation to another and from one culture to another. We are products of a long history of brotherhood of form and image makers….Things are different now than they were in Michelangelo’s time. These days the artist sees things made by the Mayans, Eskimos, and Hindus—things from all over the earth. Today the panorama is different: now there is an amalgam of viewpoints. It’s not just more complicated for the viewer but for the artist as well. Envy the Greek who was pulling himself out of ignorance and lack of skills—and each one working in a similar vein. The same is true for the Egyptians, Mayans, and Chinese. And then all of a sudden the whole panoply of centuries of art spread before our eyes in books and museums and we have to be aware of all of these forms of expression. Yes I have been eclectic in my own work. We artists can’t help but admire so much, the artworks of the past and incorporate them into our own work.''

Prior to attending Yale, Pattison did more drawing and painting than sculpture. It was at Yale that he decided to work mostly in sculpture. However, he often exhibited his paintings, watercolors and terra cotta sculptures alongside his bronze sculptures at gallery shows.


{{Quote box
 |quote  = ''I can go back and forth from painting to sculpture easily. They supplement one another; some of the greatest sculptors have done important paintings. I always have my sketchbooks with me. I draw every day. I have filled over one hundred books with drawings of all kinds of things. They are filled with my thoughts, ideas, and observations.''

Shortly before his death in 1999, Pattison advised his artist son Harry: “If an artist can manage to paint four or five great paintings in a lifetime that’s all that is necessary. It isn’t easy.” 

Abbott Pattison spent his summers at his home and studio on the coast of Maine, occasionally teaching at The Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, where he also served on their Board of Governors. He spent his winters in Florence, Italy where the bronze foundry that cast his works is located. The rest of his time he worked in his Chicago studio, occasionally teaching at the Art Institute of Chicago.  He continued working to the day of his death at age 82.

Currently more than thirty of Pattison’s works are on public display throughout Chicago, and his sculptures are in the collections of universities, corporations and museums worldwide, including the Whitney Museum in New York City, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Corcoran Museum in Washington, D.C., the San Francisco Museum and the Museum of the Israeli State in Jerusalem. Five of his pieces are owned by the United States State Department and are located in embassies overseas. One of Abbott Pattison’s sculptures is in Buckingham Palace, London.

[[File:Banduri, Covens et Mortier and Lisle. Imperii Orientalis et Circumjacentium Regionum.1742.jpg|right|400px|thumb|''Imperii Orientalis et Circumjacentium Regionum'' by [[Guillaume Delisle]] (1742)]]
An '''atlas''' is a collection of [[map]]s; it is typically a bundle of maps of [[Earth]] or a region of Earth.

Atlases have traditionally been bound into book form, but today many atlases are in [[multimedia]] formats.  In addition to presenting [[geographic]] features and [[political]] boundaries, many atlases often feature [[geopolitical]], social, [[religious]] and [[economic]] [[statistics]]. They also have information about the map and places in it.

==Etymology of atlases==
[[File:Mercator - Atlas - 1595.png|thumb|250px| Frontispiece of the 1595 atlas of Mercator]]
The use of the word atlas in a geographical context dates from 1595 when the German-Flemish geographer [[Gerardus Mercator]] published ''Atlas Sive Cosmographicae Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricati Figura.'' (Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe, and the universe as created.) This title provides Mercator's definition of the word as a description of the creation and form of the whole universe, not simply as a collection of maps. The volume that was published posthumously one year after his death is a wide-ranging text but, as the editions evolved, it became simply a collection of maps and it is in that sense that the word was used from the middle of the seventeenth century.  The neologism coined by Mercator was a mark of his respect for the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]], [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], the "King of Mauretania", whom he considered to be the first great geographer.&lt;ref&gt;Mercator's own account of the reasons for choosing King Atlas are given in the preface of the 1595 atlas. A translation by David Sullivan  is available in a digital version of the atlas published by  [https://web.archive.org/web/20050314051106/http://www.octavo.com/editions/mcrats/ Octavo]. The text is freely available    at the [http://mail.nysoclib.org/Mercator_Atlas/MCRATS.PDF  New York Society Library]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310032427/http://mail.nysoclib.org/Mercator_Atlas/MCRATS.PDF |date=March 10, 2016 }}, pdf page 104 (corresponding to p34 of Sullivan's text).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of atlases==
The first work that contained systematically arranged woodcut maps of uniform size, published in a book, thus representing the first modern atlas is conventionally awarded to the Flemish cartographer [[Abraham Ortelius]] who in 1570 published the collection of maps ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]''.

==Types of atlases==
A ''travel atlas'' is made for easy use during travel, and often has spiral bindings so it may be folded flat (for example [[Geographers' A-Z Map Company]] famous A–Z atlases). It has maps at a large zoom so the maps can be reviewed easily. A travel atlas may also be referred to as a ''road map''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/road%20map|title=Road map|publisher= Merriam Webster|accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''desk atlas'' is made similar to a reference book. It may be in hardback or paperback form.

There are atlases of the other planets (and their satellites) in the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The NASA Atlas of the Solar System|ISBN=978-0521561273|author1=Greeley, Ronald|author2=Batson, Raymond}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlases of [[anatomy]] exist, mapping out organs of the human body or other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schwartz |first=John |date=2008-04-22 |title=The Body in Depth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/22/science/22bass.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=2015-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Alcatraz''', which lasted from May 2 to 4, 1946, was the result of an unsuccessful escape attempt at [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]]. Two corrections officers—William A. Miller and Harold Stites—were killed along with three of the inmates. Eleven corrections officers and one uninvolved convict were also injured. Two of the surviving convicts were later executed for their roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bop.gov/about/history/alcatraz.jsp | title=A Brief History of Alcatraz | publisher=Federal Bureau of Prisons | accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcatraz==
{{main|Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary}}

Alcatraz was a maximum high-security federal prison located on Alcatraz Island in the [[San Francisco]] bay. It operated from 1934 to 1963, and had a reputation for being impossible to escape from. As a result, it housed some of the most notorious and high-profile prisoners, in particular ones who had a history of escape attempts.

==Convicts==
The escape attempt was planned by [[Bernard Coy]]. Three other convicts were involved in the main plan: Marvin Hubbard, [[Joseph Paul Cretzer|Joseph Cretzer]] and [[Clarence Carnes]]. [[Sam Shockley]] and [[Miran Edgar Thompson|Miran Thompson]] joined the escapees after the attempt had begun. Coy was a [[Great Depression|depression-era]] criminal who, in 1937, was sentenced to 25 years for bank robbery. He was moved to Alcatraz in 1938 from Atlanta, and was soon given the job of cell-house orderly which gave him a relative amount of freedom around the main cellblock. Joe Cretzer was a west coast gangster and member of the [[Cretzer-Kyle Gang]]. In 1940 he was sentenced to 25 years for murder. After two escape attempts in the first months of his incarceration, one of which resulted in another murder charge, he was transferred to Alcatraz. In May 1941, Cretzer, Shockley and two other convicts made an [[List of Alcatraz escape attempts#May 21.2C 1941|escape attempt from one of the prison's workshops]]. Carnes was the youngest prisoner to reside at Alcatraz, having been convicted of murder in 1943 at the age of 16. He made a number of escape attempts and by 1946, when he was transferred to Alcatraz, had accumulated both a life sentence and 99 years for kidnapping.

==Planning==
Through his role as a cell-house orderly, Coy noticed flaws in the prison's security: firstly, that the gun-gallery at the west end of the cell-house was protected by bars, with no additional mesh or barriers; secondly, that the corrections officer in the gallery had set routines that allowed the convicts to predict when the main cellblock, and when the gallery, would be unobserved.

== Takeover ==
On May 2, 1946, while most convicts and corrections officers were in outside workshops, Coy was in the main cellhouse sweeping the floor around C Block when kitchen orderly Marvin Hubbard called on officer William Miller to let him in as he had just finished cleaning the kitchen. As Miller was frisking Hubbard for any stolen articles, Coy attacked him from behind, and the two men overpowered the officer. They then released [[Joseph Paul Cretzer|Joseph Cretzer]] and [[Clarence Carnes]] from their cells.&lt;ref name="Bruce_book_Escape_from_Alcatraz"/&gt;

[[File:Coy Hubbard Cretzer.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Bernard Coy]], Marvin Hubbard and [[Joseph Paul Cretzer|Joe Cretzer]]]]
[[File:Samshock.jpg|thumb|75px|left|[[Sam Shockley]]]]
[[File:Thompson alcatraz.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Miran Edgar Thompson|Miran Thompson]]]]
The cellhouse had an elevated gun gallery that was regularly patrolled by an armed officer. The officer, Burt Burch, had a set routine, and the convicts had attacked Miller while Burch was away. Coy, as a cellhouse orderly, had over the years spotted a flaw in the bars protecting the gun gallery, which allowed them to be widened using a bar-spreading device consisting of a nut and bolt with client metal sleeve that moved when the nut was turned by a small wrench. Coy thus managed to spread the bars and squeeze through the widened gap (Coy starved himself in order to fit through the space between the widened bars, which was still relatively narrow) into the temporarily vacant gallery and to overpower and bind Halsey on his return. Coy kept the [[M1903 Springfield|Springfield rifle]] in the gallery and lowered an [[M1911 pistol]], keys, a number of clubs, and [[gas grenade]]s to his accomplices below.&lt;ref name="Bruce_book_Escape_from_Alcatraz"/&gt;

Continuing along the gun gallery, Coy then entered D Block, which was separated from the main cellhouse by a concrete wall and was used for prisoners kept in isolation. There, he used the rifle to force officer Cecil Corwin to open the door to the main cellhouse and let the others in. They then released about a dozen convicts including [[Sam Shockley]] and [[Miran Edgar Thompson|Miran Thompson]]. Shockley and Thompson joined Coy, Carnes, Hubbard, and Cretzer in the main cellhouse. The other prisoners returned to their cells. Miller and Corwin were placed in a cell in C Block.&lt;ref name="Bruce_book_Escape_from_Alcatraz"/&gt;

The escapees now needed to secure the key to the yard door of the prison from which they expected to make their way to the island's dock to seize the prison's [[Launch (boat)|launch]]. The boat docked daily between 14:00 and 14:30. The plan was to use the hostage officers as cover as the prisoners made their way to the dock, then [[San Francisco]] and freedom.

== Failed escape attempt ==
Miller had held on to the yard door key (against regulations), so that he could let out kitchen staff without having to disturb the gallery officer at lunch. Although they eventually found the key by searching the captive officers and the cell in which the prisoners had placed them, the door would not open because the lock had jammed as the prisoners had tried several other keys while searching for the correct one. The escape attempt was thus inadvertently foiled from the outset as the prisoners were trapped in the cellhouse.

Meanwhile, additional officers who entered the cellhouse as part of their routine were seized along with others sent to investigate when the former officer failed to report in. The prisoners were soon holding nine officers in two separate cells, but with nowhere to go, despair set in among the would-be escapees.

Having failed on their initial plan, the prisoners decided to&lt;ref name="Six Against the Rock"&gt;''Six Against the Rock'' by Clark Howard, published in 1978&lt;/ref&gt; shoot it out. At 14:30, Coy took the rifle and fired at the officers in some neighboring watchtowers, wounding one of them. Associate warden Ed Miller went to the cellhouse to investigate, armed with a gas billy club. He came across Coy, who shot at him. Miller retreated. By now, the alarm had been raised.

Their plan having failed, Shockley and Thompson urged Cretzer, who had one of the guns, to kill the hostages in case they testified against them. Cretzer opened fire on the officers, wounding five, three seriously, including Bill Miller, who later died of his wounds. Carnes, Shockley, and Thompson then returned to their cells, but Coy, Hubbard, and Cretzer decided they were not going to surrender.&lt;ref name="Alcatraz_The_Gangster_Years"&gt;''Alcatraz: The Gangster Years'' by David Ward, published in 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, one of the hostages discreetly wrote down the names of the convicts involved, circling the names of the ringleaders.

At about 18:00, a squad of armed officers entering the gun cage were shot at by the convicts. One officer, Harold Stites, was killed, and four other officers were wounded.&lt;ref name="Alcatraz_The_Gangster_Years"/&gt; Prison officials then cut the electricity and put on hold all further attempts to regain control of the cellhouse until darkness.

Warden [[James A. Johnston]] now called upon the expertise of two platoons of [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] under the direction of Generals [[Joseph Stilwell|"Vinegar" Joe Stilwell]] and [[Frank Merrill]] to guard the general population of convicts and to take the cellhouse from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ObIQUpJxHZYC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Battle+of+Alcatraz+Stillwell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3gT080VpKZ&amp;sig=Iupe3DT2nctcZ0dwZVuNTt0eKnI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hCZvU_-2CMv5oASD7YDYBA&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Battle%20of%20Alcatraz%20Stillwell&amp;f=false The Encyclopedia of American Prisons]'' by Carl Sifakis, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

After night fell, two squads of officers entered the prison to locate and rescue the captive officers. There was a long-standing rule at Alcatraz that no guns were allowed in the cellhouse, and the prison officials did not want more officers injured or killed. The convicts' position on the top of a cell block provided a nearly impregnable firing position as they were out of range of the officers in the gun cages.

At 20:00, unarmed officers entered the cellhouse, covered by armed officers in the two gun galleries overhead. They found the hostages; however, one officer was wounded by a gunshot fired from the roof of one of the cell blocks. They locked the open door to D Block. When the last officer reached safety, the officers opened a massive barrage from machine guns, mortars, and grenades on the prisoners within D Block, where the prison authorities erroneously thought one of the armed convicts was holed up. They eventually figured out that the rebellious prisoners were confined to the main cellhouse and ceased their attack until further tactics were worked out.

[[File:battle of alcatraz morgue.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bodies of Hubbard ''(left)'', [[Bernard Coy|Coy]] ''(center)'', and [[Joseph Cretzer|Cretzer]] ''(right)'' in San Francisco morgue]]

The Marines implemented a plan to drive the armed convicts into a corner with tactics they had perfected against entrenched Japanese resistance during the [[Pacific War]]. They drilled holes in the prison roof and dropped [[grenades]] into areas where they believed the convicts were to force them into a utility corridor where they could be cornered.

On May 3, at about 12:00, the convicts phoned Johnston to try to discuss a deal. Johnston would only accept their surrender. Later that day, a shot was fired at an officer as he checked out C Block's utility corridor.&lt;ref name="Bruce_book_Escape_from_Alcatraz"/&gt; That night, a constant [[fusillade]] was fired at the cell block until about 21:00. The following morning, squads of armed officers periodically rushed into the cellhouse firing repeatedly into the narrow corridor. At 09:40 on May 4, they finally entered the corridor and found the bodies of Cretzer, Coy, and Hubbard.

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Carnes shockley thompson.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Clarence Carnes]] ''(left)'', [[Sam Shockley]] ''(center)'', and [[Miran Edgar Thompson|Miran Thompson]] ''(right)'' on their way to court]]
Before the escape attempt, Hubbard had petitioned for a writ of [[habeas corpus]] on the grounds that his confession had been beaten out of him; he had produced hospital records to back up his claims. A federal hearing into the matter had been scheduled for the Monday after he died. The case was dismissed on a motion filed by prosecutor Joseph Karesh, who is quoted as saying that had it gone through, Hubbard would have had "a fair chance" of being released.&lt;ref name="Bruce_book_Escape_from_Alcatraz"&gt;''[[Escape from Alcatraz (book)|Escape from Alcatraz]]'' by J. Campbell Bruce, published in 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Miran Edgar Thompson|Miran Thompson]] and [[Sam Shockley]] were executed in the [[gas chamber]] at [[San Quentin]] on December 3, 1948, for their role in the Battle of Alcatraz. Carnes was given an additional life sentence but was eventually released from [[prison]] in 1973. However, he breached his parole conditions, was sent back to prison and died there from complications from [[A.I.D.S.]] in 1988. Increased security measures ensured that there were no more escape attempts until 1956.

== Film depictions ==
Several versions of the events of the Battle of Alcatraz have been depicted on film:
* ''[[Brute Force (1947 film)|Brute Force]]'' (1947) — Starring [[Burt Lancaster]]. Although inspired by the events, this is a highly fictionalized account of an attempted prison break. It was unusual at the time for the level of violence it portrayed.
* ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'' (1962) — Again starring Burt Lancaster, this film briefly depicts a largely fictional version of the battle which, from the start, is portrayed as a full-scale riot rather than a discrete escape attempt. [[Robert Stroud]], the "[[Birdman of Alcatraz]]", is given unwarranted credit for ending the conflict.
* ''[[Alcatraz — The Whole Shocking Story]]'' (1980) — A factually based TV drama of the events incorporated into a larger narrative of the history of Alcatraz as seen through the eyes of its youngest prisoner, [[Clarence Carnes]].
* ''[[Six Against the Rock]]'' (1987) — Starring [[David Carradine]] as Bernard Coy, based on the semi-fictional book by Clark Howard.
*''Alcatraz'' (2018) — Indy film depicting the events.

A '''cloud atlas''' is a pictorial key (or an [[atlas]]) to the [[nomenclature]] of [[cloud]]s.  Early cloud atlases were an important element in the training of [[meteorologist]]s and in [[weather forecasting]], and the author of a 1923 atlas stated that "increasing use of the air as a means of transportation will require and lead to a detailed knowledge of all the secrets of cloud building."&lt;ref name=McAdie&gt;{{cite book

==History==
[[File:Clouds Atlas.png|thumb|right|300px|An example of a Cloud Atlas]]
Throughout the 19th century nomenclatures and classifications of cloud types were developed, followed late in the century by cloud atlases.  The first nomenclature ("naming", also "numbering") of clouds in [[English language|English]], by [[Luke Howard]], was published in 1802.&lt;ref name=McAdie/&gt;  It followed a similar effort in [[French language|French]] by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] in 1801.  Howard's nomenclature defined four fundamental types of clouds:  [[Cirrus cloud|cirrus]] or thread-cloud, [[Cumulus cloud|cumulus]] or heap-cloud, [[Stratus cloud|stratus]] or flat cloud (level sheet), and [[Nimbus cloud|nimbus]] or rain-cloud (see [[Cloud#classification of clouds|Classification of clouds]]).  There followed a long period of development of the field of [[meteorology]] and the classification of clouds, leading up to 1896, the International Year of Clouds.  The history of this period is the subject of a popular book, ''The Invention of Clouds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During that time, the Englishmen Rev. Clement Ley and Hon. [[Ralph Abercromby (meteorologist)|Ralph Abercromby]], were influential.  Both men died before the classification was settled, however.  Ley wrote a book, ''Cloudland'', that is well known to meteorologists.  Abercromby contributed a number of papers on the subject, stressing the most important (and then novel) fact that clouds are the same everywhere in the world{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}.  He also wrote in collaboration with [[Hugo Hildebrand Hildebrandsson]] a detailed classification of clouds.  This was adopted in Hildebrandsson's 1890 ''Cloud Atlas''.

In 1891 the International Meteorological Conference at Munich recommended the classification of Abercromby and Hildebrandsson.

In 1896 another International Meteorological Conference was held, and in conjunction with it was published the first ''[[International Cloud Atlas]]''.  It was a political and technical triumph, and an immediate [[de facto standard]].  The scientific photography of clouds required several technical advances, including faster films (shorter exposures), color, and sufficient contrast between cloud and sky.  It was [[Albert Riggenbach]] who worked out how to increase the contrast by using a [[Nicol prism]] to filter polarized light.  Others learned to achieve similar results using mirrors or lake surfaces, and selectively photographing in certain parts of the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Many subsequent editions of ''International Cloud Atlas'' were published, including editions in 1906 and 1911.  In this interval several other cloud atlases appeared, including M. J. Vincent's ''Atlas des Nuages'' (Vincent's Cloud Atlas) in 1908 in the Annales of the Royal Observatory, Brussels, Volume 20.  It was based on the 1906 ''International Cloud Atlas'', but with additions, and it classified the clouds into three group by height of the cloud base above ground:  lower, middle, upper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[David Ricardo]] developed the classical theory of comparative advantage in 1817 to explain why countries engage in [[international trade]] even when one country's workers are more efficient at producing ''every'' single good than workers in other countries. He demonstrated that if two countries capable of producing two commodities engage in the [[free market]], then each country will increase its overall consumption by exporting the good for which it has a comparative advantage while importing the other good, provided that there exist differences in [[labor productivity]] between both countries.&lt;ref&gt;Baumol, William J. and Alan S.

==Classical theory and David Ricardo's formulation==
[[Adam Smith]] first alluded to the concept of ''absolute advantage'' as the basis for international trade in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'':
{{quote|text=If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry employed in a way in which we have some advantage. The general industry of the country, being always in proportion to the capital which employs it, will not thereby be diminished [...] but only left to find out the way in which it can be employed with the greatest advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Adam|title=An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations|date=1776}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Writing several decades after Smith in 1808, [[Robert Torrens (economist)|Robert Torrens]] articulated a preliminary definition of comparative advantage as the loss from the closing of trade:
{{quote|text=[I]f I wish to know the extent of the advantage, which arises to England, from her giving France a hundred pounds of broad cloth, in exchange for a hundred pounds of lace, I take the quantity of lace which she has acquired by this transaction, and compare it with the quantity which she might, at the same expense of labour and capital, have acquired by manufacturing it at home. The lace that remains, beyond what the labour and capital employed on the cloth, might have fabricated at home, is the amount of the advantage which England derives from the exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torrens|first1=Lionel|title=The Economists Refuted and Other Early Economic Writings|year=1808|publisher=Kelley|location=New York|edition=1984|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Image:David ricardo.jpg|150px|right|thumb|David Ricardo]]

In 1817, [[David Ricardo]] published what has since become known as the theory of comparative advantage in his book ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]''.

===Ricardo's example===
[[File:Ricardo_example_of_comparative_advantage.svg|thumb|Graph illustrating Ricardo's example:&lt;br /&gt;In case I (diamonds), each country spends 3600 hours to produce a mixture of cloth and wine.&lt;br /&gt;In case II (squares), each country specializes in its comparative advantage, resulting in greater total output.]]
In a famous example, Ricardo considers a [[world economy]] consisting of two countries, [[Portugal]] and [[England]], which produce two goods of identical quality. In Portugal, the ''a priori'' more efficient country, it is possible to produce [[wine]] and [[cloth]] with less labor than it would take to produce the same quantities in England. However, the relative costs of producing those two goods differ between the countries.

In this illustration, England could commit 100 hours of labor to produce one unit of cloth, or produce {{sfrac|5|6}} units of wine. Meanwhile, in comparison, Portugal could commit 90 hours of labor to produce one unit of cloth, or produce {{sfrac|9|8}} units of wine. So, Portugal possesses an ''absolute advantage'' in producing cloth due to fewer labor hours, and England has a ''comparative advantage'' due to lower opportunity cost.

In the absence of trade, England requires 220 hours of work to both produce and consume one unit each of cloth and wine while Portugal requires 170 hours of work to produce and consume the same quantities. England is more efficient at producing cloth than wine, and Portugal is more efficient at producing wine than cloth. So, if each country specializes in the good for which it has a comparative advantage, then the global production of both goods increases, for England can spend 220 labor hours to produce 2.2 units of cloth while Portugal can spend 170 hours to produce 2.125 units of wine. Moreover, if both countries specialize in the above manner and England trades a unit of its cloth for {{sfrac|5|6}} to {{sfrac|9|8}} units of Portugal's wine, then both countries can consume at least a unit each of cloth and wine, with 0 to 0.2 units of cloth and 0 to 0.125 units of wine remaining in each respective country to be consumed or exported. Consequently, both England and Portugal can consume more wine and cloth under free trade than in [[autarky]].

===Ricardian model===
The '''Ricardian model''' is a [[general equilibrium]] mathematical model of [[international trade]]. Although the idea of Ricardian model was first presented in the ''Essay on Profits'' (a single-commodity version) and then in the ''Principles'' (a multi-commodity version) by [[David Ricardo]], the first mathematical Ricardian model was published by [[William Whewell]] in 1833.&lt;ref name="John Wood"&gt;{{cite book |title= David Ricardo: Critical Assessments|last= Wood |first= John Cunningham|year= 1991 |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis |location= |isbn= |page= 312 |url= https://books.google.com/books?hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;id=h5GzUUfTL4sC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA312&amp;dq=Ricardian+model&amp;ots=9IoNTNflKz&amp;sig=EFXTd8Nvy83tKsyhn4tgouZJGWs#v=onepage&amp;q=Ricardian%20model&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest test of Ricardian model was performed by G.D.A MacDougall, which was published in ''Economic Journal'' of 1951 and 1952.
&lt;ref name="Barbara Ingham"&gt;{{cite book |title= International Economics: A European Focus|last= Ingham |first= Barbara|year= 2004 |publisher= Pearson Education |location= |isbn= |page= 22 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zIaS9R7HUGIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=international+economics&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kkmdVbeBN6bnygPPy7OwCg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=RIcardian%20model&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ricardian model, trade patterns depend on productivity differences.

The following is a typical modern interpretation of the classical Ricardian model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krugman|first1=Paul|last2=Obstfeld|first2=Maurice|title=International Economics: Theory and Policy|year=1988|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|pages=27–36|edition=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interest of simplicity, it uses notation and definitions, such as opportunity cost, unavailable to Ricardo.

The world economy consists of two countries, Home and Foreign, which produce wine and cloth. Labor, the only factor of production, is [[labor mobility|mobile]] domestically but not internationally; there may be migration between sectors but not between countries. We denote the labor force in Home by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle L&lt;/math&gt;, the amount of labor required to produce one unit of wine in Home by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle a_{LW}&lt;/math&gt;, and the amount of labor required to produce one unit of cloth in Home by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle a_{LC}&lt;/math&gt;. The total amount of wine and cloth produced in Home are &lt;math&gt;Q_W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_C&lt;/math&gt; respectively. We denote the same variables for Foreign by appending a [[prime (symbol)|prime]]. For instance, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle a'_{LW}&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of labor needed to produce a unit of wine in Foreign.

We don't know if Home is more productive than Foreign in making cloth. That is, if &lt;math&gt;a_{LC}&lt;a'_{LC}&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, we don't know if Home has an absolute advantage in wine. However, we will assume that Home is more ''relatively'' productive in cloth than Foreign:
:&lt;math&gt;a_{LC}/a'_{LC}&lt;a_{LW}/a'_{LW}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, we may assume that Home has a comparative advantage in cloth in the sense that it has a lower opportunity cost for cloth in terms of wine than Foreign:
:&lt;math&gt;a_{LC}/a_{LW}&lt;a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the absence of trade, the relative price of cloth and wine in each country is determined solely by the relative labor cost of the goods. Hence the relative autarky price of cloth is &lt;math&gt;a_{LC}/a_{LW}&lt;/math&gt; in Home and &lt;math&gt;a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}&lt;/math&gt; in Foreign. With free trade, the price of cloth or wine in either country is the world price &lt;math&gt;P_C&lt;/math&gt; or&lt;math&gt;P_W&lt;/math&gt;.

Instead of considering the world demand (or supply) for cloth and wine, we are interested in the world ''relative demand'' (or ''relative supply'') for cloth and wine, which we define as the ratio of the world demand (or supply) for cloth to the world demand (or supply) for wine. In general equilibrium, the world relative price &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P_C/P_W&lt;/math&gt; will be determined uniquely by the intersection of world relative demand &lt;math&gt;\textstyle RD&lt;/math&gt; and world relative supply &lt;math&gt;\textstyle RS&lt;/math&gt; curves.

[[File:World relative supply and demand in the classical Ricardo model of one-factor international trade between two countries.svg|thumb|The demand for cloth relative to wine decreases with the relative price of cloth in terms of wine; the supply &lt;math&gt;RS&lt;/math&gt; of cloth relative to wine increases with relative price. Two relative demand curves &lt;math&gt;RD_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;RD_2&lt;/math&gt; are drawn for illustrative purposes.]]
We assume that the relative demand curve reflects substitution effects and is decreasing with respect to relative price. The behavior of the relative supply curve, however, warrants closer study. Recalling our original assumption that Home has a comparative advantage in cloth, we consider five possibilities for the relative quantity supplied at a given price.

* If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P_C/P_W = a_{LC}/a_{LW}&lt;a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}&lt;/math&gt;, then Foreign specializes in wine, for the wage &lt;math&gt;P'_W/a'_{LW}&lt;/math&gt; in the wine sector is greater than the wage &lt;math&gt;P'_C/a'_{LC}&lt;/math&gt; in the cloth sector. However, Home workers are indifferent between working in either sector. As a result, the quantity supplied can take any value.
* If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P_C/P_W &lt; a_{LC}/a_{LW}&lt;a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}&lt;/math&gt;, then both Home and Foreign specialize in wine, for similar reasons as above, and so the quantity supplied is zero.
* If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle a_{LC}/a_{LW}&lt;P_C/P_W &lt; a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}&lt;/math&gt;, then Home specializes in cloth whereas Foreign specializes in wine. The quantity supplied is given by the ratio &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{L/a_{LC}}{L'/a'_{LW}}&lt;/math&gt; of the world production of cloth to the world production of wine.
* If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle a_{LC}/a_{LW}&lt;a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}&lt;P_C/P_W&lt;/math&gt;, then both Home and Foreign specialize in cloth. The quantity supplied tends to infinity as the quantity of wine supplied approaches zero.
* If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle a_{LC}/a_{LW}&lt;a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}=P_C/P_W&lt;/math&gt;, then Home specializes in cloth while Foreign workers are indifferent between sectors. Again, the relative quantity supplied can take any value.

[[File:Consumption possibilities in the classical Ricardo model of one-factor international trade between two countries.svg|thumb|The blue triangle depicts Home's original production (and consumption) possibilities. By trading, Home can also consume bundles in the pink triangle despite facing the same productions possibility frontier.]]
As long as the relative demand is finite, the relative price is always bounded by the inequality
:&lt;math&gt; a_{LC}/a_{LW}\leq {P_C/P_W}\leq {a'_{LC}/a'_{LW}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In autarky, Home faces a [[production possibilities frontier|production constraint]] of the form
:&lt;math&gt; a_{LC}Q_C+a_{LW}Q_W\leq L,&lt;/math&gt;
from which it follows that Home's cloth consumption at the production possibilities frontier is
:&lt;math&gt;Q_C=L/a_{LC}-(a_{LW}/a_{LC})Q_W&lt;/math&gt;.

With free trade, Home produces cloth exclusively, an amount of which it exports in exchange for wine at the prevailing rate. Thus Home's overall consumption is now subject to the constraint
:&lt;math&gt;a_{LC}Q_C+a_{LC}(P_W/P_C)Q_W\leq L&lt;/math&gt;
while its cloth consumption at the ''consumption possibilities'' frontier is given by
:&lt;math&gt;Q_C=L/a_{LC}-(P_W/P_C)Q_W\geq  L/a_{LC}-(a_{LW}/a_{LC})Q_W&lt;/math&gt;.

A symmetric argument holds for Foreign. Therefore, by trading and specializing in a good for which it has a comparative advantage, each country can expand its consumption possibilities. Consumers can choose from bundles of wine and cloth that they could not have produced themselves in closed economies.

=== Terms of trade ===
Terms of trade is the rate at which one good could be traded for another. If both countries specialize in the good for which they have a comparative advantage then trade, the terms of trade for a good (that benefit both entities) will fall between each entities opportunity costs. In the example above one unit of cloth would trade for between &lt;math&gt;\frac 56&lt;/math&gt; units of wine and &lt;math&gt;\frac 9 8&lt;/math&gt; units of wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reviewecon.com/comparative-advantage.html|title=AP Economics Review: Comparative Advantage, Absolute Advantage, and Terms of Trade|last=|first=|date=2016-09-28|website=www.reviewecon.com/comparative-advantage.html|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haberler's opportunity costs formulation==
In 1930 Gottfried Haberler detached the doctrine of comparative advantage from Ricardo’s labor theory of value and provided a modern opportunity-cost formulation. Haberler’s reformulation of comparative advantage revolutionized the theory of international trade and laid the conceptual groundwork of modern trade theories.

Haberler’s innovation was to reformulate the theory of comparative advantage such that the value of good X is measured in terms of the forgone units of production of good Y rather than the labor units necessary to produce good X, as in the Ricardian formulation. Haberler implemented this opportunity-cost formulation of comparative advantage by introducing the concept of a production possibility curve into international trade theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernhofen|first1=Daniel|title=Gottfried haberler's 1930 reformulation of comparative advantage in retrospect|journal=Review of International Economics|date=2005|volume=13|issue=5|pages=997–1000|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9396.2005.00550.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern theories==
Since 1817, economists have attempted to generalize the [[Ricardian model]] and derive the principle of comparative advantage in broader settings, most notably in the [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] ''specific factors'' [[Ricardo-Viner]] and ''factor proportions'' [[Heckscher–Ohlin model]]s. Subsequent developments in the [[new trade theory]], motivated in part by the empirical shortcomings of the H–O model and its inability to explain [[intra-industry trade]], have provided an explanation for aspects of trade that are not accounted for by comparative advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maneschi|first1=Andrea|title=Comparative Advantage in International Trade: A Historical Perspective|year=1998|publisher=Elgar|location=Cheltenham|pages=6–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, economists like [[Alan Deardorff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deardorff|first1=Alan|title=The General Validity of the Law of Comparative Advantage|journal=Journal of Political Economy|date=Oct 1980|volume=88|issue=5|pages=941–57|doi=10.1086/260915}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avinash Dixit]], [[Gottfried Haberler]], and [[Victor D. Norman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dixit|first1=Avinash|last2=Norman|first2=Victor|title=Theory of International Trade: A Dual, General Equilibrium Approach|year=1980|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=93–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; have responded with weaker generalizations of the principle of comparative advantage, in which countries will only ''tend'' to export goods for which they have a comparative advantage.

===Dornbusch et al.'s continuum of goods formulation===
In both the Ricardian and H–O models, the comparative advantage theory is formulated for a 2 countries/2 commodities case. It can be extended to a 2 countries/many commodities case, or a many countries/2 commodities case. Adding commodities in order to have a smooth continuum of goods is the major insight of the seminal paper by Dornbusch, Fisher, and Samuelson. In fact, inserting an increasing number of goods into the chain of comparative advantage makes the gaps between the ratios of the labor requirements negligible, in which case the three types of equilibria around any good in the original model collapse to the same outcome. It notably allows for transportation costs to be incorporated, although the framework remains restricted to two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dornbusch | first1 = R. | last2 = Fischer | first2 = S. | last3 = Samuelson | first3 = P.

===Deardorff's general law of comparative advantage===
Skeptics of comparative advantage have underlined that its theoretical implications hardly hold when applied to individual commodities or pairs of commodities in a world of multiple commodities. Deardorff argues that the insights of comparative advantage remain valid if the theory is restated in terms of averages across all commodities. His models provide multiple insights on the correlations between vectors of trade and vectors with relative-autarky-price measures of comparative advantage. What has become to be known as the "Deardorff's general law of comparative advantage" is a model incorporating multiple goods, and which takes into account tariffs, transportation costs, and other obstacles to trade.

===Alternative approaches===
Recently, Y. Shiozawa succeeded in constructing a theory of international value in the tradition of Ricardo's [[cost-of-production theory of value]].&lt;ref&gt;Y.

==Empirical approach to comparative advantage==
Comparative advantage is a theory about the benefits that specialization and trade would bring, rather than a strict prediction about actual behavior. (In practice, governments restrict international trade for a variety of reasons; under [[Ulysses S. Grant]], the US postponed opening up to free trade until its industries were up to strength, following the example set earlier by Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Ha-Joon|author-link=Ha-Joon Chang|date=December 2003|title=Kicking Away the Ladder: The "Real" History of Free Trade|url=|journal=FPIF Special Report|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Nonetheless there is a large amount of [[empirical evidence|empirical]] work testing the predictions of comparative advantage. The empirical works usually involve testing predictions of a particular model. For example, the Ricardian model predicts that technological differences in countries result in differences in labor productivity. The differences in labor productivity in turn determine the comparative advantages across different countries. Testing the Ricardian model for instance involves looking at the relationship between relative labor productivity and international trade patterns. A country that is relatively efficient in producing shoes tends to export shoes.

===Direct test: natural experiment of Japan===
Assessing the validity of comparative advantage on a global scale with the examples of contemporary economies is analytically challenging because of the multiple factors driving globalization: indeed, investment, migration, and technological change play a role in addition to trade. Even if we could isolate the workings of open trade from other processes, establishing its causal impact also remains complicated: it would require a comparison with a counterfactual world without open trade. Considering the durability of different aspects of globalization, it is hard to assess the sole impact of open trade on a particular economy.

[[Daniel Bernhofen]] and John Brown have attempted to address this issue, by using a natural experiment of a sudden transition to open trade in a market economy. They focus on the case of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernhofen|first1=Daniel|last2=Brown|first2=John|title=A Direct Test of the Theory of Comparative Advantage: The Case of Japan|journal=Journal of Political Economy|date=2004|volume=112|issue=1|pages=48–67|doi=10.1086/379944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernhofen|first1=Daniel|last2=Brown|first2=John|title=An Empirical Assessment of the Comparative Advantage Gains from Trade: Evidence from Japan|journal=American Economic Review|date=2005|volume=95|issue=1|pages=208–225.|doi=10.1257/0002828053828491}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Japanese economy indeed developed over several centuries under autarky and a quasi-isolation from international trade but was, by the mid-19th century, a sophisticated market economy with a population of 30 million. Under Western military pressure, Japan opened its economy to foreign trade through a series of [[unequal treaties]].

In 1859, the treaties limited tariffs to 5% and opened trade to Westerners. Considering that the transition from autarky, or self-sufficiency, to open trade was brutal, few changes to the fundamentals of the economy occurred in the first 20 years of trade. The general law of comparative advantage theorizes that an economy should, on average, export goods with low self-sufficiency prices and import goods with high self-sufficiency prices. Bernhofen and Brown found that by 1869, the price of Japan's main export, silk and derivatives, saw a 100% increase in real terms, while the prices of numerous imported goods declined of 30-75%. In the next decade, the ratio of imports to gross domestic product reached 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernhofen|first1=Daniel|last2=John|first2=Brown|title=Testing the General Validity of the Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem|journal=American Economic Journal: Microeconomics|date=2016|volume=8|issue=4|pages=54–90|doi=10.1257/mic.20130126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural estimation===
Another important way of demonstrating the validity of comparative advantage has consisted in 'structural estimation' approaches. These approaches have built on the Ricardian formulation of two goods for two countries and subsequent models with many goods or many countries. The aim has been to reach a formulation accounting for both multiple goods and multiple countries, in order to reflect real-world conditions more accurately. Jonathan Eaton and Samuel Kortum underlined that a convincing model needed to incorporate the idea of a 'continuum of goods' developed by Dornbusch et al. for both goods and countries. They were able to do so by allowing for an arbitrary (integer) number i of countries, and dealing exclusively with unit labor requirements for each good (one for each point on the unit interval) in each country (of which there are i).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eaton|first1=Jonathan|last2=Kortum|first2=Samuel|title=Putting Ricardo to Work†|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|date=Spring 2012|volume=26|issue=2|pages=65–90|doi=10.1257/jep.26.2.65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earlier empirical work===
Two of the first tests of comparative advantage were by MacDougall (1951, 1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=MacDougall, G. D. A.| title=British and American exports: A study suggested by the theory of comparative costs. Part I.| journal=The Economic Journal| year=1951| volume=61 | issue=244|pages=697–724}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=MacDougall, G. D.

Part II.| journal=The Economic Journal| year=1952| volume=62 | issue=247|pages=487–521}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prediction of a two-country Ricardian comparative advantage model is that countries will export goods where output per worker (i.e. productivity) is higher. That is, we expect a positive relationship between output per worker and number of exports. MacDougall tested this relationship with data from the US and UK, and did indeed find a positive relationship. The statistical test of this positive relationship was replicated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Stern, Robert M.| title=British and American productivity and comparative costs in international trade| journal=Oxford Economic Papers |year=1962| pages=275–96.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Balassa, Bela. | title=An empirical demonstration of classical comparative cost theory| journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|year=1963 |pages=231–238.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with new data by Stern (1962) and Balassa (1963).

Dosi et al. (1988)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Dosi, G., Pavitt, K, &amp; L. Soete | title=The Economics of Technical Change and International Trade | year=1988 | publisher=Brighton: Wheatsheaf }}&lt;/ref&gt; conduct a book-length empirical examination that suggests that international trade in manufactured goods is largely driven by differences in national technological competencies.

One critique of the textbook model of comparative advantage is that there are only two goods. The results of the model are robust to this assumption. Dornbusch et al. (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Dornbusch, R. |author2=Fischer, S. |author3=P. Samuelson |last-author-amp=yes | title=Comparative Advantage, Trade and Payments in a Ricardian Model with a Continuum of Goods | journal=American Economic Review | volume=67 | year=1977 | pages=823–39  }}&lt;/ref&gt; generalized the theory to allow for such a large number of goods as to form a smooth continuum. Based in part on these generalizations of the model, Davis (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Davis, D. | title=Intraindustry Trade: A Heckscher-Ohlin-Ricardo Approach | journal=Journal of International Economics | volume=39 | year=1995 | pages=201–26 | doi=10.1016/0022-1996(95)01383-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a more recent view of the Ricardian approach to explain trade between countries with similar resources.

More recently, Golub and Hsieh (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Golub, S.  |author2=C-T Hsieh | title=Classical Ricardian Theory of Comparative Advantage Revisited | journal=Review of International Economics | volume=8 | issue=2 | year=2000 | pages=221–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; presents modern statistical analysis of the relationship between relative productivity and trade patterns, which finds reasonably strong correlations, and Nunn (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Nunn, N| title=Relationship-Specificity, Incomplete Contracts, and the Pattern of Trade| journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics | volume=122 | issue=2 | year=2007 |pages=569–600}}&lt;/ref&gt; finds that countries that have greater enforcement of contracts specialize in goods that require relationship-specific investments.

Taking a broader perspective, there has been work about the benefits of international trade. Zimring &amp; Etkes (2014)&lt;ref&gt;Zimring, A. &amp; Etkes, H. (2014) "When Trade Stops: Lessons from the 2007–2010 Gaza Blockade". ''Journal of International Economics'', forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt; finds that the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip]], which substantially restricted the availability of imports to Gaza, saw labor productivity fall by 20% in three years. Markusen et al. (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Markusen, J.R. |author2=Melvin J.R., Kaempfer |author3=W.M., K.

==Considerations==
===Development economics===
The theory of comparative advantage, and the corollary that nations should specialize, is criticized on pragmatic grounds within the [[import substitution industrialization]] theory of [[development economics]], on empirical grounds by the [[Singer–Prebisch thesis]] which states that terms of trade between primary producers and manufactured goods deteriorate over time, and on theoretical grounds of [[infant industry]] and [[Keynesian economics]]. In older economic terms, comparative advantage has been opposed by [[mercantilism]] and [[economic nationalism]]. These argue instead that while a country may initially be comparatively disadvantaged in a given industry (such as Japanese cars in the 1950s), countries should shelter and invest in industries until they become globally competitive. Further, they argue that comparative advantage, as stated, is a static theory – it does not account for the possibility of advantage changing through investment or economic development, and thus does not provide guidance for long-term economic development.

Much has been written since Ricardo as commerce has evolved and cross-border trade has become more complicated. Today trade policy tends to focus more on "[[competitive advantage]]" as opposed to "comparative advantage". One of the most in-depth research undertakings on "competitive advantage" was conducted in the 1980s as part of the [[Reagan administration]]'s [[Project Socrates]] to establish the foundation for a technology-based competitive strategy development system that could be used for guiding international trade policy.

==Criticism==
Several arguments have been advanced against using comparative advantage as a justification for advocating free trade, and they have gained an audience among economists. For example, [[James Brander]] and [[Barbara Spencer]] demonstrated how, in a strategic setting where a few firms compete for the world market, export subsidies and import restrictions can keep foreign firms from competing with national firms, increasing welfare in the country implementing these so-called strategic trade policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Krugman |first=Paul R. |title=Is Free Trade Passe? |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |year=1987 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=131–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the overwhelming consensus of the economics profession remains that while these arguments are theoretically valid under certain assumptions, these assumptions do not usually hold and should not be used to guide trade policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Irwin |first=Douglas. |title=Retrospectives: Challenges to Free Trade |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |year=1991 |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=201–08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory Mankiw]], chairman of the Harvard Economics Department, has said: ″Few propositions command as much consensus among professional economists as that open world trade increases economic growth and raises living standards.″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/05/outsourcing-redux.html| author=Mankiw, N.G. |title=Outsourcing Redux|website=
Greg Mankiw's Blog: Random Observations for Students of Economics|date=May 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[James K. Galbraith]] disputes these claims of the benefit of comparative advantage. He states that "free trade has attained the status of a god" and that ". . . none of the world's most successful trading regions, including Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and now mainland China, reached their current status by adopting [[neoliberal]] trading rules." He argues that ". . . comparative advantage is based upon the concept of [[constant returns]]: the idea that you can double or triple the output of any good simply by doubling or tripling the inputs. But this is not generally the case. For manufactured products, increasing returns, learning, and technical change are the rule, not the exception; the cost of production falls with experience. With increasing returns, the lowest cost will be incurred by the country that starts earliest and moves fastest on any particular line. Potential competitors have to protect their own industries if they wish them to survive long enough to achieve competitive scale."&lt;ref&gt;James K. Galbraith, The Predator State, Free Press, 2008, pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

Galbraith then explains that nations trapped into specializing in agriculture are condemned to perpetual poverty. Agriculture is dependent on a finite natural resource called land. People can't make more of it. As the population increases the per capita land resources decreases. Also the average farm size has also been increasing. If a nation is not allowed to expand into manufacturing and only specialize in agriculture, that nation is condemned to an ever expanding poverty.

The strength of free trade is its weakness. A diverse economy is a healthy economy. A specialized economy is a weak economy.&lt;ref&gt;James K. Galbraith, The Predator State, Free Press, 2008, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Cecil Woodham-Smith]], Ireland in the 1800s is an example of the dangers of specialization. When the union with Great Britain was formed in 1800, Irish textile industries protected by tariffs were exposed to world markets where England had a comparative advantage in technology, experience and scale of operation which devastated the Irish industry. Ireland was forced to specialize in the export of grain while the displaced Irish labor was forced into subsistence farming and relying on the potato for survival. When the potato blight occurred the resulting famine killed at least one million Irish in one of the worst famines in European history. As Woodham-Smith would later comment, "the Irish peasant was told to replace the potato by eating his grain, but [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Trevelyan]] once again refused to take any steps to curb the export of food from Ireland. 'Do not encourage the idea of prohibiting exports,' he wrote, on September 3, (1846) 'perfect free trade is the right course'."&lt;ref&gt;[[Cecil Woodham-Smith]], ''[[The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845–1849]]'', 1962, pp. 49, 100, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical and neoclassical formulations of comparative advantage theory differ in the tools they use but share the same basis and logic. Comparative advantage theory says that market forces lead all factors of production to their best use in the economy. It indicates that international free trade would be beneficial for all participating countries as well as for the world as a whole because they could increase their overall production and consume more by specializing according to their comparative advantages. Goods would become cheaper and available in larger quantities.  Moreover, this specialization would not be the result of chance or political intent, but would be automatic. However, the theories of free trade and comparative advantage are based on assumptions that are neither theoretically nor empirically valid&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;http://www.sudoc.abes.fr/xslt//DB=2.1/SET=3/TTL=1/CLK?IKT=1016&amp;TRM=Les+fondements+non+neoclassiques+du+protectionnisme&lt;/ref&gt;:

====Unrealistic assumption 1: capital and labour are not internationally mobile====
The international immobility of labour and capital is essential to the theory of comparative advantage. Without this, there would be no reason for international free trade to be regulated by comparative advantages. Classical and neoclassical economists all assume that labour and capital do not circulate between nations. At the international level, only the goods produced can move freely, with capital and labour trapped in countries. David Ricardo was aware that the international immobility of labour and capital is an indispensable hypothesis. He devoted half of his explanation of the theory to it in his book. He even explained that if labour and capital could move internationally, then comparative advantages could not determine international trade. Ricardo assumed that the reasons for the immobility of the capital would be:&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;
{{quote|text=[T]he fancied or real insecurity of capital, when not under the immediate control of its owner, together with the natural disinclination which every man has to quit the country of his birth and connexions, and intrust himself with all his habits fixed, to a strange government and new laws.}}

Neoclassical economists, for their part, argue that the scale of these movements of workers and capital is negligible. They developed the theory of price compensation by factor that makes these movements superfluous.
In practice, however, workers move in large numbers from one country to another. Today, labour migration is truly a global phenomenon. And, with the reduction in transport and communication costs, capital has become increasingly mobile and frequently moves from one country to another. Moreover, the neoclassical assumption that factors are trapped at the national level has no theoretical basis and the assumption of factor price equalisation cannot justify international immobility. Moreover, there is no evidence that factor prices are equal worldwide. Comparative advantages cannot therefore determine the structure of international trade&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;.

If they are internationally mobile and the most productive use of factors is in another country, then free trade will lead them to migrate to that country. This will benefit the nation to which they emigrate, but not necessarily the others.

====Unrealistic assumption 2: there are no externalities====
An externality is the term used when the price of a product does not reflect its cost or real economic value. The classic negative externality is environmental degradation, which reduces the value of natural resources without increasing the price of the product that has caused them harm. The classic positive externality is technological encroachment, where one company's invention of a product allows others to copy or build on it, generating wealth that the original company cannot capture. If prices are wrong due to positive or negative externalities, free trade will produce sub-optimal results&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;.

For example, goods from a country with lax pollution standards will be too cheap. As a result, its trading partners will import too much. And the exporting country will export too much, concentrating its economy too much in industries that are not as profitable as they seem, ignoring the damage caused by pollution.

On the positive externalities, if an industry generates technological spinoffs for the rest of the economy, then free trade can let that industry be destroyed by foreign competition because the economy ignores its hidden value. Some industries generate new technologies, allow improvements in other industries and stimulate technological advances throughout the economy; losing these industries means losing all industries that would have resulted in the future&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;.

====Unrealistic assumption 3: productive resources move easily from one industry to another====
Comparative advantage theory deals with the best use of resources and how to put the economy to its best use. But this implies that the resources used to manufacture one product can be used to produce another object. If they cannot, imports will not push the economy into industries better suited to its comparative advantage and will only destroy existing industries&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;.

For example, when workers cannot move from one industry to another - usually because they do not have the right skills or do not live in the right place - changes in the economy's comparative advantage will not shift them to a more appropriate industry, but rather to unemployment or precarious and unproductive jobs&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;.

====Unrealistic assumption 4: the gains resulting from international trade are only static gains====
Comparative advantage theory allows for a "static" and not a "dynamic" analysis of the economy. That is, it examines the facts at a single point in time and determines the best response to those facts at that point in time, given our productivity in various industries. But when it comes to long-term growth, it says nothing about how the facts can change tomorrow and how they can be changed in someone's favour. It does not indicate how best to transform factors of production into more productive factors in the future&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;.

According to theory, the only advantage of international trade is that goods become cheaper and available in larger quantities. Improving the static efficiency of existing resources would therefore be the only advantage of international trade. And the neoclassical formulation assumes that the factors of production are given only exogenously. Exogenous changes can come from population growth, industrial policies, the rate of capital accumulation (propensity for security) and technological inventions, among others. Dynamic developments endogenous to trade such as economic growth are not integrated into Ricardo's theory. And this is not affected by what is called "dynamic comparative advantage". In these models, comparative advantages develop and change over time, but this change is not the result of trade itself, but of a change in exogenous factors&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;.

However, the world, and in particular the industrialized countries, are characterized by dynamic gains endogenous to trade, such as technological growth that has led to an increase in the standard of living and wealth of the industrialized world. In addition, dynamic gains are more important than static gains. 

====Unrealistic assumption 5: trade will always be balanced and there is an adjustment mechanism====
A crucial assumption in both the classical and neoclassical formulation of comparative advantage theory is that trade is balanced, which means that the value of imports is equal to the value of each country's exports. The volume of trade may change, but international trade will always be balanced at least after a certain adjustment period. The balance of trade is essential for theory because the resulting adjustment mechanism is responsible for transforming the comparative advantages of production costs into absolute price advantages. And this is necessary because it is the absolute price differences that determine the international flow of goods. Since consumers buy a good from the one who sells it cheapest, comparative advantages in terms of production costs must be transformed into absolute price advantages. In the case of floating exchange rates, it is the exchange rate adjustment mechanism that is responsible for this transformation of comparative advantages into absolute price advantages. In the case of fixed exchange rates, neoclassical theory suggests that trade is balanced by changes in wage rates&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;.

So if trade were not balanced in itself and if there were no adjustment mechanism, there would be no reason to achieve a comparative advantage. However, trade imbalances are the norm and balanced trade is in practice only an exception. In addition, financial crises such as the Asian crisis of the 1990s show that balance of payments imbalances are rarely benign and do not self-regulate. There is no adjustment mechanism in practice. Comparative advantages do not turn into price differences and therefore cannot explain international trade flows&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;. 

Thus, theory can very easily recommend a trade policy that gives us the highest possible standard of living in the short term but none in the long term. This is what happens when a nation runs a trade deficit, which necessarily means that it goes into debt with foreigners or sells its existing assets to them. Thus, the nation applies a frenzy of consumption in the short term followed by a long-term decline.

====Unrealistic assumption 6: international trade is understood as bartering====
The assumption that trade will always be balanced is a corollary of the fact that trade is understood as barter. The definition of international trade as barter trade is the basis for the assumption of balanced trade. Ricardo insists that international trade takes place as if it were purely a barter trade, a presumption that is maintained by subsequent classical and neoclassical economists. The quantity of money theory, which Ricardo uses, assumes that money is neutral and neglects the velocity  of a currency. Money has only one function in international trade, namely as a means of exchange to facilitate trade&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;.

In practice, however, the velocity  of circulation is not constant and the quantity of money is not neutral for the real economy. A capitalist world is not characterized by a barter economy but by a market economy. The main difference in the context of international trade is that sales and purchases no longer necessarily have to coincide. The seller is not necessarily obliged to buy immediately. Thus, money is not only a means of exchange. It is above all a means of payment and is also used to store value, settle debts and transfer wealth. Thus, unlike the barter hypothesis of the comparative advantage theory, money is not a commodity like any other. Rather, it is of practical importance to specifically own money rather than any commodity. And money as a store of value in a world of uncertainty has a significant influence on the motives and decisions of wealth holders and producers&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;.

====Unrealistic assumption 7: labour or capital is used to its full potential====
Ricardo and later classical economists assume that labour tends towards full employment and that capital is always fully used in a liberalized economy, because no capital owner will leave its capital unused but will always seek to make a profit from it. That there is no limit to the use of capital is a consequence of Jean-Baptiste Say's law, which presumes that production is limited only by resources and is also adopted by neoclassical economists&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;.

From a theoretical point of view, comparative advantage theory must assume that labour or capital is used to its full potential and that resources limit production. There are two reasons for this: the realization of gains through international trade and the adjustment mechanism. In addition, this assumption is necessary for the concept of opportunity costs. If unemployment (or underutilized resources) exists, there are no opportunity costs, because the production of one good can be increased without reducing the production of another good. Since comparative advantages are determined by opportunity costs in the neoclassical formulation, these cannot be calculated and this formulation would lose its logical basis&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;.

If a country's resources were not fully utilized, production and consumption could be increased at the national level without participating in international trade. The whole raison d'être of international trade would disappear, as would the possible gains. In this case, a State could even earn more by refraining from participating in international trade and stimulating domestic production, as this would allow it to employ more labour and capital and increase national income. Moreover, any adjustment mechanism underlying the theory no longer works if unemployment exists&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;.

In practice, however, the world is characterised by unemployment. Unemployment and underemployment of capital and labour are not short-term phenomena, but are common and widespread. Unemployment and untapped resources are more the rule than the exception.

Software '''audio synthesis environment'''s typically consist of an [[audio programming language]] (which may be [[Visual programming language|graphical]]) and a user environment to design/run the language in. Although many of these environments are comparable in their abilities to produce high-quality audio, their differences and specialties are what draw users to a particular platform. This article compares noteworthy audio synthesis environments, and enumerates basic issues associated with their use.

==Subjective comparisons==
Audio synthesis environments comprise a wide and varying range of software and hardware configurations. Even different versions of the same environment can differ dramatically. Because of this broad variability, certain aspects of different systems cannot be directly compared. Moreover, some levels of comparison are either very difficult to objectively quantify, or depend purely on personal preference.

Some of the commonly considered subjective attributes for comparison include:
* [[Usability]] (how difficult is it for beginners to generate some kind of meaningful output)
* [[Usability#Definition|Learnability]] (how steep the [[learning curve]] is for new, average, and advancing users)
* Sound "quality" (which environment produces the most subjectively appealing sound)
* [[Flow (psychology)|Creative flow]] (in what ways does the environment affect the creative process - e.g. guiding the user in certain directions)

These attributes can vary strongly depending on the tasks used for evaluation.

Some other common comparisons include:
* Audio performance (issues such as throughput, latency, concurrency, etc.)
* System performance (issues such as ''buggyness'' or stability)
* Support and community (who uses the system and who provides help, advice, training and tutorials)
* System capabilities (what is possible and what is not possible [regardless of effort] with the system)
* Interoperability (how well does the system integrate with other systems from different vendors)

=== Building blocks of sound and sound "quality" ===
Audio software often has a slightly different "sound" when compared against others. This is because there are different ways to implement the basic building blocks (such as [[sinewave]]s, [[pink noise]], or [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]]) which result in slightly different aural characteristics. Although people can of course prefer one system's "sound" over another, perhaps the best output can be determined by using sophisticated audio analyzers in combination with the listener's ears. The idea of this would be to arrive at what most would agree is as "pure" a sound as possible.

=== User interface ===
The interface to an audio system often has a significant influence on the creative flow of the user, not because of what is ''possible'' (the stable/mature systems listed here are fully featured enough to be able to achieve an enormous range of sonic/compositional objectives), but because of ''what is made easy'' and ''what is made difficult''. This is again very difficult to boil down to a brief comparative statement. One issue may be which [[interface metaphor]]s are used (e.g. boxes-and-wires, documents, flow graphs, hardware mixing desks).

The '''Cradley Heath Workers' Institute''' was built between 1911 and 1912 in Lomey Town, [[Cradley Heath]], West Midlands, England.&lt;ref name=wcm/&gt; It was built as a social centre for the Black Country, intended to become a venue for educational meetings and lectures. It also housed Union offices, where members could come to seek guidance, and from which the Contributory Unemployment Fund would be distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tuckwell|first=Gertrude|title=Letter from the Executive Committee of the Women's Trade Union League|date=April 1911|author2=Macarthur, Mary |author3=Shackleton, W. J. |url=http://www.bclm.co.uk/media/learning/library/witr_imagesanddocuments.pdf|format=letter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the building was threatened by a bypass and so was moved to the [[Black Country Living Museum]].

==Design and construction==
The Institute's architect was local man [[A T Butler]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclm.co.uk/media/visiting/library/cradleyheathworkersinstitute-information.pdf BCLM – Workers' Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; With its projected gables, leaded windows, exposed brickwork and signage in green tiles, the building is a demonstration of [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts style]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black Country Living Museum|title=Women Chainmakers: be anvil or hammer|publisher=Black Country Living Museum|page=20|url=http://www.teachers.org.uk/files/Chainmakers-A4-24pp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Construction of the Institute was funded using money left over from the strike fund of the 1910 women chainmakers' strike, led by [[Mary Macarthur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blackcountry/content/articles/2006/01/19/cradley_heath_workers_institute_feature.shtml BBC – The 'Stute' to be rebuilt]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1915 and 1933 it largely functioned as a cinema.&lt;ref name=wcm /&gt; It was then used as a [[billiards]] hall until 1950, after which it became [[Royal Mail|postal sorting office]] until 1995.&lt;ref name=wcm /&gt; It was moved to the [[Black Country Living Museum]] in 2006 after a bypass threatened the site.&lt;ref name=wcm&gt;{{cite book |title=Women Chain Makers: Be anvil or hammer |year=2009 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-9562031-1-3 |pages=19–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It now contains period offices, which are demonstrated by Museum staff, and an exhibition about [[Mary Macarthur]]. The original auditorium houses a café for the museum and the stage is used for special events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclm.co.uk/map52.htm BCLM]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cubitus''''' is a [[Franco-Belgian comics]] series, and the basis for the '''''Wowser''''' cartoon series appearing in the [[United States]]. ''Cubitus'' was created by the Belgian [[cartoonist]] [[Dupa]], and features Cubitus, a large [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog, who lives with his owner Semaphore. Cubitus is known as ''Dommel'' in [[Flanders]] and the [[Netherlands]], ''Muppelo'' or ''Pom Pom'' in [[Finland]], ''Teodoro'' in [[Italy]] and Доммель in [[Russia]]. His name derives from the old anatomical name of the [[ulna]] bone, supposedly derived from the Greek ''kybiton'' (elbow).

==Synopsis==
The series tells the story of Cubitus, a good-natured large, white dog endowed with speech. He lives in a house in the suburbs with his master, Sémaphore, a retired sailor, next door to Sénéchal, the black and white cat who is Cubitus' nemesis.

A vast majority of the album publications collect single page gags, but a few gather collections of shorter stories or, in rare cases, one long story throughout the entire album. Some of the single gag albums or short story compilations are thematic, with for instance in "''Cubitus illustre ses ancêtres''" revisiting history of humankind, "''L'ami ne fait pas le moine''" being pastiches of fellow authors from ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine or ''Les enquêtes de l'inspecteur Cubitus'' where he is a fictional police inspector.

===Characters===
*'''Cubitus''': Hero of the series, he is a white dog with a large belly, a black snout and yellow tail. Initially a dog with hair covering the eyes, Cubitus ended up becoming still more anthropomorphic. Nearly entirely human in behaviour, he walks on two legs, has hands instead of paws, and is able to perform any human action, although he retains his canine love of bones.
*'''Sémaphore''': A retired sailor who is the "Master" of Cubitus, even if sometimes the relationship of master and dog can be reversed. In the series, Semaphore's role is mainly to create inventions that are intended to be functional and aid his friends, but in the end lead to trouble.
*'''Sénéchal''': A black and white cat, close neighbour and Cubitus' worst natural enemy. In longer stories he may be Cubitus' ally.
*'''Ventenpoupe''': an old friend of Semaphore, and a swindler.

Every now and them appears:
*'''Manuel de Cotalos Y Mucho Gusto''', the ghost of Semaphore's improbable Sidecar outfit' pannier.

==Publication history==
''Cubitus'' first appeared in the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] magazine ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' on April 16, 1968.&lt;ref name="BDO-t68"&gt;{{cite web | last = BDoubliées | title =  Tintin année 1968| url =http://bdoubliees.com/tintinbelge/annees/1968.htm|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series gained immediate popularity, and began album publication in 1972.&lt;ref name="BDzoom"&gt;{{cite web | last = BDzoom | title = Le dernier Cubitus paraîtra en février 2001 | url = http://www.bdzoom.com/index.cfm?page=display&amp;class=info&amp;object=arta20001209093948&amp;rub=coulisse | language = French }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After several years of gags and album publications, it became the title strip for a magazine of its own.&lt;ref name="lambiek"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lambiek Comiclopedia | title = Dupa | url =http://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/dupa.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first publication of ''Cubitus'' was published by [[Le Lombard]] in December 1989, though it proved short-lived, lasting only six issues.&lt;ref name="loup"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Danslagueuleduloup.com|title=Détails pour la Série Cubitus Magazine|url=http://www.danslagueuleduloup.com/GENPAGES/DSE_CCUD.HTM|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the series was relaunched by [[Pierre Aucaigne]] (scenarist), and [[Michel Rodrigue]] (artist) under the title ''Les nouvelles aventures de Cubitus''.

[[File:Clodion2small.jpg|thumb|Dance of Time (Clodion) detail]]
'''The Dance of Time: Three Nymphs Supporting a Clock''' is a work by the French sculptor [[Claude Michel]] (1738–1814), also known as Clodion. Executed in 1788, it includes three [[terracotta]] female figures, frequently described as [[nymphs]], dancing around a column that supports a pendulum clock with rotating annular dial by Jean-Baptiste Lepaute (1727–1802), the younger brother of [[Jean-André Lepaute]].&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Carol. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E2D91031F935A25755C0A9609C8B63 "Inside Art: New Treasures at the Frick: Two Sculptures (One That Ticks)"]. New York Times. June 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only eighteenth-century clock featuring a terracotta sculpture as a completed work of art known to scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Poulet, Anne L. 2006. "The Frick Collection acquires Clodion's Dance of time." Members' Magazine. New York: Frick Collection.{{OCLC|84646937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
Clodion may have been influenced by Poussin's painting, ''[[A Dance to the Music of Time (painting)|A Dance to the Music of Time]]'', which was executed between 1634 and 1636 for Giulio Rospigliosi, the future [[Clement IX]], and features figures personifying the hours, the seasons, and the fortunes of mankind. According to the seventeenth-century art critic and biographer [[Gian Pietro Bellori]], the patron was primarily responsible for formulating the iconography of this painting, which reflects on the cycles of life through the representation of the passage of time. Although the painting remained in the Rospigliosi family until 1713, the composition was well known through prints and painted copies. The painting eventually passed through the collection of Cardinal Fesch, uncle of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], sometime after 1713 and appears to have been in France until 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Katie, 2014. “Enlightenment and Beauty: Sculptures by Houdon and Clodion through April 5, 2015.” Members' Magazine. New York: Frick Collection.{{OCLC|883788413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source for Clodion's sculpture may have been a Roman copy of a Hellenistic marble group known as the ''Three Nymphs'', which is presently in the collection of the [[Louvre]]. Thus, the three graceful figures could represent nymphs, the [[Charites|Three Graces]], or the [[Horae]]–female deities personifying the passage of time. It is also possible that the dancing maidens were meant to evoke all of these associations while, as one specialist in eighteenth-century sculpture has noted, playing on the theme of the [[caryatid]].&lt;ref&gt;Poulet, Anne L. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition==
The clock was acquired by The [[Frick Collection]] in 2006 with funds provided by [[Winthrop Kellogg Edey]] (1938-1999), an American connoisseur and collector of clocks and watches and a leading scholar on [[horology]]. The Edey Collection includes a bequest of twenty-five clocks, fourteen watches, and a reference library relating to the history of time measurement.&lt;ref&gt;Andrewes, William J.H. 2001.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3868">'''''De moribus tartarorum, lituanorum et moscorum''''' ("On the Customs of Tatars, Lithuanians and Muscovites") is a 16th-century Latin treatise by '''Michalo Lituanus''' ("Michael the Lithuanian"). The work, which was originally dedicated to Grand Duke of Lithuania [[Sigismund II Augustus]], survived only in ten fragments that were first published in 1615 by [[Johann Grasser]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=el&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor-first=Simas |editor-last=Sužiedėlis | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title=Michalo Lituanus | year=1970–1978 | publisher=Juozas Kapočius | volume=III | location=Boston, Massachusetts | id={{LCC|74-114275}} | pages=516–517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
The identity of the author, also known as Michalon Litwin or Michalo the Lithuanian, is not known. In the book's title his name is given in the [[genitive case|genitive]] as "Michalonis Lithuani". Modern historians, including the Lithuanian [[Ignas Jonynas]] and the Russian [[Matvey Lubavsky]], have identified the author as [[Michał Tyszkiewicz (envoy)|Michał Tyszkiewicz]], the Lithuanian envoy to the [[Crimean Tatars]] in 1537–39.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; The Polish historian [[Jerzy Ochmański]] meanwhile has proposed the publicist and humanist [[Venceslaus Nicolaus]] (Vaclovas Mikalojaitis, c.1490 – c.1560), who served as a secretary in the [[Grand Duke of Lithuania|Grand Duke]]'s chancery for about 30 years.&lt;ref name=tar&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor-first=Jonas |editor-last=Zinkus | encyclopedia=Tarybų Lietuvos enciklopedija | title=Mykolas Lietuvis | year=1985–1988 | publisher=Vyriausioji enciklopedijų redakcija | volume=III | location=Vilnius, Lithuania |id={{LCC|86232954}} | pages=83|display-editors=etal |language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronicle==
The treatise is thought to date from around 1550: the author's ideas and writing style show the clear influence of [[humanism]].

While the treatise contains some useful historical information, this should be treated with care. The work is neither a [[chronicle]] nor a [[Guide book|travel book]], but is rather a political [[essay]] which is critical of the author's motherland ([[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]) and overly praises [[Muscovy]] and the [[Crimean Khanate]] for their centralized governments and united subjects.&lt;ref name=rus&gt;[http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/rus/Litvin/framepred.htm Introduction] to the Russian translation: Михалон Литвин. О нравах татар, литовцев и москвитян. Moscow 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The author examines the reasons behind Lithuania's decreasing power and influence, criticises the nobility and high Catholic officials, and advocates a strong centralized government.&lt;ref name=tar/&gt; He further idealizes the era of [[Vytautas the Great]], when the ruling class supposedly did not pursue self-interests, and instead served the state.&lt;ref name=el/&gt;

Michalo supports the theory that the Lithuanian nation was founded by the legendary dynasty of the [[Palemonids]], in the times of the Late Roman Empire, and he proposes introducing Latin as the Grand Duchy's official language, thereby restoring forgotten ancestral traditions.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; As proof of the similarity between [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and Latin, Michalo includes a list of 74 words that are similar in the two languages. He also compares ancient Roman traditions with [[Lithuanian mythology|pagan Lithuanian]] customs.&lt;ref name=el/&gt;

A '''domain name registrar''' is an organization that manages the reservation of [[Internet]] [[domain name]]s. A domain name registrar must be accredited by a [[generic top-level domain]] (gTLD) [[Domain name registry|registry]] or a [[country code top-level domain]] (ccTLD) registry. A registrar operates in accordance with the guidelines of the designated [[domain name registry|domain name registries]].

==History==
Until 1999, [[Network Solutions|Network Solutions Inc.]] (NSI) operated the registries for the [[.com|''com'']], [[.net|''net'']], and [[.org|''org'']] top-level domains (TLDs). In addition to the function of [[domain name registry]] operator, it was also the sole registrar for these domains. However, several companies had developed independent registrar services. In 1996 one such company, NetNames, developed  the concept of a standalone commercial domain name registration service which would sell domain registration and other associated services to the public, effectively establishing the retail arm of an industry with the registries being the wholesalers. NSI assimilated this model, which ultimately led to the separation of registry and registrar functions.

In 1997, PGMedia filed an anti-trust suit against NSI citing the [[DNS root zone]] as an essential facility, and the US [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) was joined as a defendant in this action.&lt;ref&gt;Clausing, Jeri (19 September 1997) [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/091997domain.html National Science Foundation Is Added to Suit on Domain Names]. Partners.nytimes.com. Retrieved on 2013-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, NSI was granted immunity from [[anti-trust]] litigation, but the litigation created enough pressure to restructure the domain name market.

In October 1998, following pressure from the growing domain name registration business and other interested parties, NSI's agreement with the [[United States Department of Commerce]] was amended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/accreditation/history Registrar Accreditation: History of the Shared Registry System]. ICANN. Retrieved on 2013-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt; This amendment required the creation of a shared registration system that supported multiple registrars. This system officially commenced service on November 30, 1999 under the supervision of the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN), although there had been several testbed registrars using the system since March 11, 1999. Since then, over 900 registrars have entered the market for domain name registration services.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Of the registrars who initially entered the market, many have continued to grow and outpace rivals. [[Go Daddy]] is the largest registrar, but has very poor reviews from customers. {{Cite web|url=https://webhostinggeeks.com/providers/godaddy|title=GoDaddy customers reviews|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}} Other more successful{{peacock term|date=August 2017}} registrars include [[Enom|eNom]], [[Tucows]], [[Melbourne IT]]. Registrars who initially led the market but later were surpassed by rivals include [[Network Solutions]] and [[Endurance International Group|Dotster]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Each ICANN-accredited registrar must pay a fixed fee of US$4,000 plus a variable fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/approved-with-specs-2013-09-17-en|title=2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement - ICANN|website=www.icann.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607183437/https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/approved-with-specs-2013-09-17-en|archivedate=2017-06-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sum of variable registrar fees is intended to total US$3.8 million.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The competition created by the shared registration system enables end users to choose from many registrars offering a range of related services at varying prices.

==Designated registrar==
Domain registration information is maintained by the domain name registries, which contract with domain registrars to provide registration services to the public. An end user selects a registrar to provide the registration service, and that registrar becomes the ''designated registrar'' for the domain chosen by the user.

Only the designated registrar may modify or delete information about domain names in a central registry database. It is not unusual for an end user to switch registrars, invoking a [[#Domain name transfer|domain transfer]] process between the registrars involved, that is governed by specific domain name transfer policies.

When a registrar registers a &lt;tt&gt;com&lt;/tt&gt; domain name for an end-user, it must pay a maximum annual fee of US$7.85&lt;ref&gt;[https://investor.verisign.com/releaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=591560 Verisign Announces Increase in .com/.net Domain Name Fees (NASDAQ:VRSN)]. Investor.verisign.com. Retrieved on 2013-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[VeriSign]], the registry operator for &lt;tt&gt;com&lt;/tt&gt;, and a US$0.18 annual administration fee to ICANN. Most domain registrars price their services and products to address both the annual fees and the administration fees that must be paid to ICANN. [[Barrier to entry|Barriers to entry]] into the bulk registrar industry are high for new companies without an existing customer base.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Many registrars also offer registration through reseller affiliates. An end-user registers either directly with a registrar, or indirectly through one or more layers of resellers. As of 2010, the retail cost generally ranges from a low of about $7.50 per year to about $35 per year for a simple domain registration, although registrars often drop the price far lower&amp;nbsp;– sometimes even free&amp;nbsp;– when ordered with other products such as [[web hosting service]]s.

The maximum period of registration for a domain name is  10 years. Some registrars offer longer periods of up to 100 years,{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} but such offers involve the registrar renewing the registration for their customer; the 100-year registration would not be in the official registration database.

==DNS hosting==
{{main|DNS hosting|Domain name system}}
Registration of a domain name establishes a set of [[name server]] records in the DNS servers of the parent domain, indicating the [[IP address]]es of DNS servers that are authoritative for the domain. This provides a reference for direct queries of domain data.

Registration of a domain does not automatically imply the provision of DNS services for the registered domain. Most registrars do offer [[DNS hosting]] as an optional free service for domains registered through them.  If DNS services are not offered, or the end-user opts out, the end-user is responsible for procuring or self-hosting DNS services. Registrars require the specification of usually at least two name servers.

==DNSSEC support==
The Domain Name System Security Extensions ([[DNSSEC]]) is a suite of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifications for securing certain kinds of information provided by the Domain Name System. This involves a registrar processing public key data and creating DS records for addition into the parent zone. All new GTLD registries and registrars must support DNSSEC.

==Domain name transfer==&lt;!--[[domain transfer]] redirects here--&gt;
A domain name transfer is the process of changing the designated registrar of a domain name. ICANN has defined a ''Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars|url= http://www.icann.org/en/transfers/policy-en.htm|work= |publisher= [[ICANN]]|date=15 March 2009|accessdate=24 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual process of a domain name transfer is
# The end user verifies that the [[whois]] admin contact info is correct, particularly the email address; obtains the authentication code ([[Transfer secret|EPP]] or [[Unique Domain Authentication Identifier|UDAI]] transfer code) from the old registrar, and removes any [[domain lock]] that has been placed on the registration.  If the whois information had been out of date and is now updated, the end-user should wait 12–24 hours before proceeding further, to allow time for the updated data to propagate.
# The end user contacts the new registrar with the wish to transfer the domain name to their service, and supplies the authentication code.
# The gaining Registrar must obtain express authorization from either the Registered Name Holder or the Administrative Contact. A transfer may only proceed if confirmation of the transfer is received by the gaining Registrar from one of these contacts. The authorization must be made via a valid Standardized Form of Authorization, which may be sent e.g. by e-mail to the e-mail addresses listed in the WHOIS. The Registered Name Holder or the Administrative Contact must confirm the transfer. The new registrar starts electronically the transfer of the domain with the help of the authentication code (auth code).
# The old registrar will contact the end user to confirm the authenticity of this request.  The end user may have to take further action with the old registrar, such as returning to the online management tools, to re-iterate their desire to proceed, in order to expedite the transfer.
# The old registrar will release authority to the new registrar.
# The new registrar will notify the end user of transfer completion.  The new registrar may have automatically copied over the domain server information, and everything on the website will continue to work as before.  Otherwise, the domain server information will need to be updated with the new registrar.

After this process, the new registrar is the domain name's designated registrar. The process may take about five days.  In some cases, the old registrar may intentionally delay the transfer as long as allowable.  After transfer, the domain cannot be transferred again for 60 days, except back to the previous registrar.

It is unwise to attempt to transfer a domain immediately before it expires. In some cases, a transfer can take up to 14 days, meaning that the transfer may not complete before the registration expires. This could result in loss of the domain name registration and failure of the transfer.  To avoid this, end users should either transfer well before the expiration date, or renew the registration before attempting the transfer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dyndns.com/support/kb/domain_expirations.html My domain expired! what do I do?]. dyndns.com&lt;/ref&gt;

If a domain registration expires, irrespective of the reason, it can be difficult, expensive, or impossible for the original owner to get it back.  After the expiration date, the domain status often passes through several management phases, often for a period of months; usually it does not simply become generally available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/gtld-lifecycle.htm Life Cycle of a Typical gTLD Domain Name]. ICANN. Retrieved on 2013-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfer scams===
{{main|Domain slamming}}

The introduction of a shared registry system opened up the previous domain registration monopoly to new entities known as registrars, which were qualified by ICANN to do business. Many registrars had to compete with each other, and although some companies offered [[value added]] services or used [[viral marketing]], others, such as [[VeriSign]] and the [[Brandon Gray Internet Services|Domain Registry of America]] attempted to trick customers to switch from their current registrar using a practice known as [[domain slamming]].

Many of these transfer scams involve a notice sent in the mail, fax, or e-mail. Some scammers contact end-users by telephone (because the contact information is available through [[WHOIS]]) to obtain more information. These notices would include information publicly available from the WHOIS database to add to the look of authenticity. The text would include [[legalese]] to confuse the end user into thinking that it is an official binding notice. Scam registrars go after domain names that are expiring soon or have recently expired. Domain name expiry dates are readily available via WHOIS.

==Drop catcher==
{{main|Domain drop catching}}
A ''drop catcher'' is a domain name registrar who offers the service of attempting to quickly register a given domain name for a customer if that name becomes available—that is, to "catch" a "dropped" name—when the domain name's registration expires and is then deleted, either because the registrant abandons the domain or because the registrant did not renew the registration prior to deletion.

==Registrar rankings==
Several organizations post market-share-ranked lists of domain name registrars and numbers of domains registered at each. The published lists differ in which [[top-level domain]]s (TLDs) they use; in the frequency of updates; and in whether their basic data is absolute numbers provided by registries, or daily changes derived from [[Zone file]]s.

The lists appear to all use at most 16 publicly available generic TLDs (gTLDs) that existed as of December 2009, plus .us. A February 2010 ICANN ''zone file access concept paper''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.icann.org/en/topics/new-gtlds/zfa-concept-paper-18feb10-en.pdf|title=Zone file access concept paper|work=icann.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains that most country code TLD (ccTLD) registries stopped providing zone files in 2003, citing abuse.

Published rankings and reports include:

* Monthly (but with approximately a three-month delay), [[ICANN]] posts registry reports created by the registries of all gTLDs. These reports list absolute numbers of domains registered with each ICANN-accredited registrar.
* Yearly (but covering only the period from 2002 to 2007), DomainTools.com, operated by Name Intelligence, Inc., published registrar statistics. Totals  included .com, .net, .org, .info, .biz and .us. It cited "daily changes" (presumably from daily zone files) as the basis for its yearly aggregates.

The '''Former Military Chapel (Bachelor Quarters)''' is a building on [[Alcatraz Island]] off the coast of [[San Francisco]], United States. It is located next to the Sally Port and Dock and the [[Building 64]] residential apartments. It was built in the 1920s in the mission-revival style to accommodate for the officers at the military prison on the island. The ground floor had quarters for the officers and their families who worked at the military prison and the top floor was used as a school and chapel.&lt;ref name="Dunbar1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunbar|first=Richard|title=Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OoXM5O9glN8C&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Casa Editrice Bonechi|isbn=978-88-8029-940-0|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; It functioned as a Sunday School for children of the military personnel on Sundays.&lt;ref name="Jr.2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jr.|first=Jerry Lewis Champion|title=Alcatraz Unchained|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQV5wM6qj1oC&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=26 April 2012|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4685-8753-1|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1934, when Alcatraz became a Federal Penitentiary, the building was used as a Bachelor Quarters for unmarried officers.

'''"Found in collection"''' '''or FIC''' is a term used by a [[museum]] to refer to "undocumented objects that remain without status after all attempts to reconcile them to existing records of permanent collection and loan objets are completed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Buck| first1=edited by Rebecca A.| last2=Gilmore| first2=Jean Allman| title=MRM5: Museum registration methods| date=2010| publisher=AAM Press, American Association of Museums| location=Washington, DC| isbn=978-1-933253-15-2| page=477| edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the best efforts of museum staff, museums often have FIC items. This term was developed so that collections with incomplete provenance would be handled ethically and with transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Code of Ethics for Museums| url=http://www.aam-us.org/resources/ethics-standards-and-best-practices/code-of-ethics| website=American Alliance of Museums| publisher=American Alliance of Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the paperwork and information accompanying the material, the museum has several choices in how to proceed.

==Occurrences==
Museums today are meticulous about the documentation they keep when [[Collection (artwork)#Accessioning|accessioning]] new items into their collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=NPS Museum Handbook, Part II: Museum Records| url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHII/mushbkII.html| website=National Park Service-Museum Management Program| publisher=National Park Service| accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not always the case. As the museum field professionalized so did the standard of paperwork required to accession a collection. Items can become FIC artifacts if records were not kept initially or if the documentation regarding the property transfer was lost in a disaster such as a fire or flood. Additionally, if the museum is old, it has decades of accessioning paperwork that may require its own preservation plan.

===Lapsed loans===
FIC collections can also be the result of long-term or permanent loans where contact has lapsed between the two parties. It is for this reason that most museums now renew their loans on an annual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Loan Abandoned Property Disposition|url=https://www.arcsinfo.org/programs/resources/legislation/old-loan-abandoned-property-disposition|website=Old Loan Abandoned Property Disposition|publisher=Association of Registrars and Collections Specialists|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malaro|first1=Marie C.|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Ildiko Pogány|title=A legal primer on managing museum collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-58834-322-2|pages=319–354|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key participants==
*[[Registrar (museum)|Registrar]]/[[Collection manager|Collections Manager]]: Ultimately registrars and collections managers are in charge of accession paperwork and artifact documentation. Collections staff are responsible for assembling as much information as possible on the provenance of the objects in order to help the Collections Committee and other staff make the most informed decision they can. 
* Collections Committee: A Collections Committee at a museum is composed of [[curator]]s, collections staff, educators and senior administrators who decide what will become part of the museum's collection based on the museum's [[Collections policy|collections management policy]]. Just as importantly, the Committee rules on items that should be removed from a museum's collection due to duplication or lack of relevance to the museum's mission. The Committee will also discuss collections related issues including any FIC artifact concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing a Collections Management Policy|url=http://www.aam-us.org/docs/continuum/developing-a-cmp-final.pdf?sfvrsn=2|website=Developing a Collections Management Policy|publisher=American Alliance of Museums|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Lawyer|Legal Counsel]]: The Collections staff and legal counsel need to work closely together. There are very specific laws governing museums and unclaimed property. 
*Director/President &amp; Board of Trustees: The Director and Board of Trustees all need to sign off and be aware of accessions and deaccessions to their museum's collection. They rely heavily on the recommendation of the Collections Committee.
*[[Public relations|Public Relations Officer]]: While museums try to deal with FIC items openly, the knowledge that museums may not have complete intellectual and physical control of their collections can sometimes cause controversy or public concern. The Public Relations Officer is in charge of explaining how museum's work, how the situation has occurred, and what is being done to solve the problem. Public education and transparency can go a long way towards keeping the relationship between the community and museum positive.
* Claimant: During the FIC process a claimant may come forward to stake a claim to the found property. Depending on the nature of the claim and whether or not the claimant is a person or organization different procedures will be followed. However, the claimant must provide some type of documentary evidence to support their position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malaro|first1=Marie C.|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Ildiko Pogány|title=A legal primer on managing museum collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-58834-322-2|pages=391–395|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What constitutes ownership==
Museums require three pieces of information to accession a collection. 
#  Written intent to donate on behalf of the donor.
#  Acceptance of the collection into the museum's holdings by the museum (usually through the Collections Committee). 
#  Physical possession of the collection.

The most common way this is achieved is through a [[Deed of gift|Deed of Gift]], which states these three criteria in one document&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to Deeds of Gift|url=http://www2.archivists.org/publications/brochures/deeds-of-gift|website=A Guide to Deeds of Gift|publisher=Society of American Archivists|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What action can be taken==
'''Please seek professional legal advice when dealing with FIC materials.''' Regardless of whether or not the museum wishes to retain ownership of the item, if possible the collections staff should contact the previous owner to either obtain a deed of gift or return the collection.

===Short term===
In order to keep track of the FIC collection, a temporary number should be assigned that is completely different in format from the museum's accession number to avoid further confusion. Whether the item is to be accessioned or [[Collection (artwork)#Deaccessioning|deaccessioned]], it requires establishing a chain of custody, which can be started with the application of a temporary number and assemblage of any associated documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buck|first1=edited by Rebecca A.|last2=Gilmore|first2=Jean Allman|title=MRM5 : museum registration methods|date=2010|publisher=AAM Press, American Association of Museums|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-933253-15-2|pages=109–118|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long term===
*If the museum wishes to keep the collection:
It should try to obtain ownership by following its state's unclaimed property laws or applicable international conventions. If during the found property process a claimant wishes to challenge the museum's tie to the collection, the claimant must support their case with evidential paperwork. 
* If the museum does not want the collection:
If the museum does not want to keep the artifacts due to them being irrelevant to its mission or outside of its collecting scope, it has several options. If the museum can contact the previous owner or  heirs it should do so and return the collection. If the collection has no associated paperwork, the museum should follow the appropriate laws and conventions. Once it establishes ownership through that process the museum can legally and ethically follow its deaccession procedures. This may involve transfer the collection to another cultural institution, selling the collection at public auction, or if all other methods fail, destruction of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AAMD Policy on Deaccessioning|url=https://aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/AAMD%20Policy%20on%20Deaccessioning%20website.pdf|website=AAMD|publisher=Association of Art Museum Directors|accessdate=1 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803191723/https://aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/AAMD%20Policy%20on%20Deaccessioning%20website.pdf|archivedate=3 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International conventions ==
The [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|1970 UNESCO Convention]] was created to provide a platform and environment in which countries could discuss situations in which cultural property may have been illegally transported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malaro|first1=Marie C.|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Ildiko Pogány|title=A legal primer on managing museum collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1588343222|pages=87–93|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout history cultural property has been taken as the spoils of war or trafficked by desperate individuals in order to make a profit.  For this reason museums may have to consider the 1970 UNESCO convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property when sifting through FIC collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illicit Trafficking of Cultural Property|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/1970-convention/|website=1970 Convention|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to pay particularly close attention to documentation of items that may have been acquired from conflict zones as sometimes customs forms and bills of sale are faked.

==Federal legislation==

=== Antiquities act of 1906 ===
[[Antiquities Act|The Antiquities Act of 1906]], signed by Theodore Roosevelt, was the first federal law enacted in response to a growing concern regarding the protection of cultural property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malaro|first1=Marie C.|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Ildiko Pogány|title=A legal primer on managing museum collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1588343222|pages=143–144|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law stated that antiquities could not be removed or damaged on federal property without the express permission of the government.  While not completely enforced in its day, it did set a precedent for caring for national cultural property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Antiquities Act of 1906|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/anti1906.htm|website=American Antiquities Act of 1906 16 USC 431-433|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 ===
The [[Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979|Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA)]] was a much needed upgrade to the 1906 Antiquities Act. It updated definitions to close loopholes and increased fines and penalties for violators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malaro|first1=Marie C.|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Ildiko Pogány|title=A legal primer on managing museum collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1588343222|pages=145–146|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If museums have FIC collections that may have been obtained in violation of the 1906 and 1979 legislation, they should seek legal advice and follow the provisions in the Acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (ARPA)|url=http://www.nps.gov/archeology/tools/Laws/arpa.htm|website=NPS Archaeology Program|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act===
The [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|Native American Graves Protection Act (NAGPRA)]] was signed into law in 1990 to specifically to "affirm the rights of lineal descendants, Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations to custody of Native American human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony that are in the control of federal agencies and museums".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buck|first1=edited by Rebecca A.|last2=Gilmore|first2=Jean Allman|title=MRM5 : museum registration methods|date=2010|publisher=AAM Press, American Association of Museums|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-933253-15-2|pages=448–457|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately throughout the history of the United States, Native American cultural property and even human remains were not acquired with the consent, let alone documentation. Because of this, Native American and Native Hawaiian artifacts are often FIC. In trying to resolve these culturally sensitive FIC items, NAGPRA legislation should be followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National NAGPRA|url=http://www.nps.gov/nagpra|website=National NAGPRA|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unclaimed property laws by state==
While most unclaimed property laws refer to unclaimed finances, the procedures regarding artifacts are similar.

'''Google Cultural Institute''' is an initiative unveiled by [[Google]] following the 2011 launch of the [[Google Arts &amp; Culture]] (formerly Google Art Project).

The Cultural Institute was launched in 2011, and put 42 new exhibits online on October 10, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yoshitake|first1=Mark|title=Bringing history to life|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/10/bringing-history-to-life.html|website=Google Official Blog|publisher=Google|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pfanner, Eric.

The Cultural Institute includes (and increasingly subsumes) the [[Google Art Project|Google Arts &amp; Culture]], which features high-resolution images of artworks from museums in over 40 countries; the World Wonders Project, which presents three-dimensional recreations of world heritage sites; and archival exhibitions, many in partnership with museums around the world.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/about/ Our Projects]".

The '''Grandes Heures of Anne of Brittany''' (''Les Grandes Heures d'Anne de Bretagne'' in French) is a [[Book of Hours|book of hours]], commissioned by [[Anne of Brittany]], Queen of France to two kings in succession, and illuminated in [[Tours]] or perhaps Paris by [[Jean Bourdichon]] between 1503 and 1508. It has been described by John Harthan as "one of the most magnificent Books of Hours ever made",&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 128. The name means "The Large Hours" as opposed to her "Small Hours" and "Very Small Hours" (see below); the mixed French and English of the name is usual in English sources.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] as Ms lat. 9474.  It has 49 full-page miniatures in a Renaissance style, and more than 300&amp;nbsp;pages have large borders illustrated with a careful depiction of, usually, a single species of plant.

==Description==
The book is large for a book of hours at 30.5&amp;nbsp;cm by 20&amp;nbsp;cm, and consists of 476 pages including 49 full-page [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], 12 calendar pages with genre scenes of the months of the year, two pages of Anne's [[heraldry|heraldic devices]], and 337 pages with illuminated borders showing flowers and other plants.&lt;ref&gt;Walther &amp; Wolf, 409&lt;/ref&gt; The full-page miniatures have large figures in an advanced Renaissance style for France at this date, drawing on both Italian and Flemish painting, and with well-developed [[graphical perspective|perspective]]. There are gold highlights on the figures, a technique taken from Bourdichon's master [[Jean Fouquet]], and the miniatures are framed with imitation gilded wood picture frames of the type found in [[Early Netherlandish painting]], a style Bourdichon used in some other miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 128; Blunt, 18; Walther &amp; Wolf, 409; for another example, see [[:File:Bnf059.jpg]] from Jean Marot, ''Le Voyage de Gênes'' (Voyage to Genoa), Tours, around 1508, BnF MS Fr. 5091&lt;/ref&gt; Similar frames surround the miniatures of the [[Sforza Hours]], begun in Italy in the 1490s. Outside the frames the edges of these pages are painted plain black.  Some landscape backgrounds suggest a knowledge of the ''[[sfumato]]'' style of [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 128; Walther &amp; Wolf, 409&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular specific borrowings from the architecture of [[Bramante]] and the painting of [[Perugino]] suggest that Bourdichon may have made an unrecorded visit to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[donor portrait]] of Anne at prayer, presented by her [[patron saint]]s to the dead Christ held by the [[Virgin Mary]] in a [[Pietà]] on the facing page, the Virgin meeting Anne's gaze.&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 128&lt;/ref&gt;  Night-scenes include a famous [[Annunciation to the Shepherds]] and the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 132; Walther &amp; Wolf, 408–409&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the general "sweetness of Bourdichon's style",&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 128&lt;/ref&gt; the work contains gruesome images of the mass martyrdoms of [[Saint Ursula]]'s eleven thousand virgin companions and the [[Theban Legion]], though rather characteristically both show moments after the action and contain relatively little movement. Scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' and that of the Virgin are depicted as well as a number of portraits and scenes of saints. F. 197v has the rare scene of the Virgin Mary being taught how to read by Saint Anne, who is seated on a dais like a medieval professor.
[[File:Grand Heures Anna von der Bretagne, Königin von Frankreich2.JPG|thumb|left|280px|[[Annunciation to the Shepherds]], f. 68v]]

The book is also remarkable for its realistic representations of 337 plants in the borders that most text pages are given.&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 133; Walther &amp; Wolf, 409&lt;/ref&gt;  There are flowers, cultivated and wild, shrubs, some trees and among the plants a wide variety of insects and small animals of the countryside.  The plants include ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' on f. 90v, and the major cereal crops of the day on ff. 94–96.  The insects represented are butterflies and moths, dragonflies, grasshoppers, caterpillars, beetles, flies, carpenter bees, crickets, earwigs, bees and beetles. The small animals represented are snakes, lizards, slow worms, frogs, turtles, squirrels, snails, rabbits, monkeys and spiders.  The style borrows from the elaborate and realistic borders of natural life developed in the preceding decades by Flemish illuminators, but unlike them Bourdichon generally treats only one species on a page, and often shows roots and bulbs, and labels each page with the plant's name in Latin and French, in the manner of a [[florilegium]] or a [[herbal]] (a book on medicinal plants).&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 133; Blunt, 18&lt;/ref&gt;  In most pages the border is a single panel to the outside of the text, but in others it surrounds the text on all four sides. The plants are shown as if laid out on a plain coloured surface, upon which they cast a shadow.  In 1894 [[Giulio Camus]] wrote an account of the plants in the work, and a full modern [[facsimile]] was published in 2008. There are 395 images from the book available online through the BnF.&lt;ref&gt;See external links for the facsimile and the online images&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne of Brittany was the last [[Duke of Brittany|independent ruler]] of [[Brittany]], inheriting the Duchy as a girl of twelve in 1488, and securing her inheritance was a crucial matter for both the [[House of Habsburg]] and the French Crown.  She first conducted a [[proxy marriage]] with [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], then still heir to the Empire, who had already acquired the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] for his son by his first wife [[Mary of Burgundy]] (who like Anne's father had died in a riding accident).  But there was a recent treaty between Brittany and France requiring French consent to Anne's marriage, and this had not been obtained.  After a French invasion, the marriage was swiftly annulled and one arranged with [[Charles VIII of France]].  All their four children died as infants, so when Charles died in 1498, logic dictated a marriage with his cousin and successor, [[Louis XII]], once he had annulled his marriage with Anne's sister-in-law [[Joan of France, Duchess of Berry|Jeanne de France]].  After many more pregnancies and stillborn children, at her death in 1514 Anne left two daughters, of whom [[Claude of France|Claude]] married [[Francis I of France|François I]], the cousin who succeeded to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 128–129&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a letter from the queen written in March 1508, Jean Bourdichon, who was one of the main artists regularly working for the court, was paid the sum of 1500 [[livres tournois]] in the form of 600 [[écus]], although it seems the payment was not made for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 37&lt;/ref&gt; In all, four books of hours belonging to Anne survive, including the ''Très Petites Heures d'Anne de Bretagne'' (BnF Ms nouv. acq. 3120) of about 1498, another with the same name in the [[Morgan Library]] in New York (M. 50), and the ''Petites Heures d'Anne de Bretagne'' (BnF Ms nouv. acq. 3027) of around 1503.&lt;ref&gt;Walther &amp; Wolf, 410–411&lt;/ref&gt; Prayers like ''Obsecro te'', which are written in Latin, contain words such as pronouns that indicate the gender of the supplicant. More often than not, the words indicate that the supplicant is male, even if the supplicant is female, suggesting that the prayer books were intended to be passed on as an heirloom that males would be able to use. This is true of the ''Obsecro te'' in the ''Grandes Heures of Anne of Brittany''.&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 85; this may have been to encourage the use of the books as heirlooms that would be used by descendents, including males.&lt;/ref&gt;  After Anne's death the book remained in the hands of the French royal family until the Revolution, and then passed to the government.

==In art history==
The book comes very late in the history of the illuminated manuscript, and the conception of the full-page miniatures as resembling a series of individual panel paintings, complete with frames, has seemed to many art historians a prophecy of the direction art was to take, and something of an abdication of the distinct needs of book illustration.  [[Anthony Blunt]] noted that "Many of his designs&amp;nbsp;– for instance the 'St Sebastian'&amp;nbsp;– look in reproduction like altarpieces rather than miniatures; and to this extent his art represents the decay of true illumination".&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 19; Harthan, 132; Walther &amp; Wolf, 410&lt;/ref&gt; However, royalty and the grandest other patrons continued to commission manuscripts for several further decades, and in some cases well after that, and the miniatures of the Grandes Heures are integrated with the texts of the book in the traditional ways. For example, the borders opposite miniatures are often co-ordinated with them in terms of colour.&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 132; Walther &amp; Wolf, 410&lt;/ref&gt;  By Anne's day [[printing]] was well established, with Paris as one of Europe's leading centres, and she also patronized printed books and their authors.&lt;ref&gt;See Brown in further reading, throughout.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Whitney Fosburgh''' (August 1, 1910 – August 23, 1978) was an American painter, art collector, and art historian. In addition to lecturing and writing about art, he served as Chairman of the Special Committee for White House Paintings under both President Kennedy and President Johnson. Fosburgh and his wife, [[Mary Benedict Cushing|Mary ("Minnie") Cushing]], were prominent art collectors in New York City.

== Early life ==
James Whitney Fosburgh was born in New York on August 1, 1910.  He was the son of James Boies Alleyne Fosburgh (1879–1926) and Leila Whitney (d. 1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Times|first1=Special To The New York|title=MISS LEILA WHITNEY WEDS.; Daughter of Alfred R.

He graduated from Yale University in 1933, and afterwards completed a Master's thesis on the journals of Thomas Sully, receiving his M.A. from Yale University in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://arcade.nyarc.org:80/record=b168865~S6]'', Fosburgh, James W. (1935). A Journal of Thomas Sully. Yale University, New Haven.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, he joined the governing board of the Yale Art Gallery, later the [[Yale University Art Gallery]].

== Career ==
During World War II, Fosburgh enlisted as a glider pilot and served with the [[101st Airborne Division]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/25/archives/james-w-fosburgh-67-painter-collector-and-art-adviser-is-dead.html?_r=0]'', Russell, John. "James W. Fosburgh, 67 Painter, Collector and Art Adviser, Is Dead." The New York Times (April 25, 1978): 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

He later returned to New York and worked at [[Frick Collection|The Frick Collection]], first as a docent, from October 1935-June 1938, and later as lecturer, from October 1947-May 1954.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.frick.org/research/archives/browse/institutional]'', Frick Collection Administration Records.  The Frick Collection/Frick Art Reference Library Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he began to exhibit his artwork throughout the city. In the 1950s and 1960s, he participated in group and solo shows at Durlacher Bros. Gallery, Kennedy Galleries, and Coe Kerr Galleries.

=== White House ===
Throughout the Kennedy administration, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy endeavored to restore the interiors of the White House and bring historical character to the space. Soon after her husband took office, Kennedy formed the Fine Arts Committee for the White House, naming [[Henry Francis du Pont|Henry F. du Pont]] Chairman and serving herself as Honorary Chairman.

In November 1961, Jacqueline Kennedy and Henry F. du Pont established a Special Committee for White House Paintings, part of the Fine Arts Committee for the White House, and appointed Fosburgh head of the new group. Until that point, the expertise and interests of Fine Arts Committee members had been largely focused on antique furnishings, not pictures.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunter, Marjorie. "Mrs. Kennedy Leads Hunt for Art to Grace White House." The New York Times (November 26, 1961): 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Fosburgh's Committee was charged with expanding the White House collection of paintings, including portraits, landscapes, and still lifes, and replacing "certain non-historic paintings of past Presidents with those which were actually painted from life."&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis Personal Papers. Textual Materials. Pamela Turnure Files. Subject files: White House: Special Committee for White House Paintings: [General]. JBKOPP-SF036-009. John F.

Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years—Selections from the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum [exh.]. Comp. Hamish Bowles. May 1 – July 29, 2001, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacqueline Kennedy retained for her own collection,  Fosburgh's posthumous portrait of John F. Kennedy, which was featured on the November 5, 1965 cover of LIFE Magazine. Other works by Fosburgh are in the collections of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]], and The Frick Collection.&lt;ref name="MBCFObit1978"/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1953, Fosburgh married [[Mary Benedict Cushing|Mary ("Minnie") Cushing]] (1906–1978), who had recently divorced Vincent Astor after thirteen years of marriage. Together, Fosburgh and Mary Cushing developed a significant collection of art, primarily comprising American and European paintings from the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="MBCFObit1978"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mary Fosburgh, 72; One of Cushing Sisters And a Leader in Arts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/06/archives/mary-fosburgh-72-one-of-cushing-sisters-and-a-leader-in-arts-raised.html?_r=0|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=6 November 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2663">'''''Jetha v Rex'''''&lt;ref&gt;(1929) 50 NPD 91.&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African criminal law]], with its bearing on the defence of impossibility. It was heard in the Natal Provincial Division on April 22, 1929, by Dove-Wilson JP, Tatham J and Matthews J. It was an appeal from the Durban Magistrate's Court. TB Horwood appeared for the appellant and JDM Rosenow for the Crown. The appellant's attorneys were CP Robinson &amp; Goulding.

== Facts ==
The appellant sailed for India on October 11, 1926; his estate was provisionally sequestrated on October 13, 1926. In March 1929, after his return, he was convicted of contravening section 142(a) of the Insolvency Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 32 of 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; in that he had failed to attend the first meeting of his creditors, held on November 11, 1926.

The magistrate, in his reasons, stated that he was satisfied, on the facts set out above, that it was physically impossible for appellant to attend the meeting. He convicted the appellant because he must have been aware, when he left the Union, of the act of insolvency which must have preceded his sequestration. His failure to attend the meeting, therefore, was due to his own fault in leaving the Union with knowledge of such act. The magistrate referred to ''[[R v Mahomed Abbas]]&lt;ref&gt;1916 CPD 178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1916 AD 233.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[R v Mayer Brothers]],&lt;ref&gt;6 HCG 130.&lt;/ref&gt; and said that, since the trial, his attention had been drawn to the case of ''[[R v Moosa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1929] CPD (24-12 28).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judgment ==
Dove-Wilson JP held on appeal for the Natal Provincial Division that the appellant did not know and could not have known of the date of the meeting until after it was held. In addition, it would have been physically impossible for him to attend even if he had known the date. There was, therefore, no ground for his conviction.

In ''[[Rex v Korsten]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1927) 48 NPD 12.&lt;/ref&gt; a slightly earlier case, Dove-Wilson JP had rejected the defence of impossibility, since in there the duty with which the accused had failed to comply was an absolute one: "It is no excuse for him to say that he was ignorant [of the law...]. It was his duty to make himself aware of it, and if his neglect to do so has brought about his failure [to comply...], he has contravened the law."&lt;ref&gt;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Jingbirok''''' ({{Korean|hangul=징비록|hanja=懲毖錄}} known in English as the '''''Book of Corrections'''''), written in [[Hanja|Hanmun]], is a first hand account of the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|Imjin War]] written by high ranking [[Joseon]] scholar-official [[Ryu Seong-ryong]]. Party to high level decision making on the allied [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]]-Joseon side and able to access all Joseon records, Ryu Seong-ryong's ''Jingbirok'' has become an invaluable source in the study of the conflict, and Chinese-Korean-Japanese relations. In 1969 the ''Jingbirok'' was listed as the 132nd of the [[National Treasures of South Korea]].&lt;ref name="CHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/english/search_plaza_new/ECulresult_Db_View.jsp?VdkVgwKey=11,01320000,37&amp;queryText=*&amp;requery=0&amp;mc=EN_03_02|title=Jingbirok (The Book of Correction) |publisher=Cultural Heritage Administration, ROK|accessdate=2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="koreanet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Culture/view?articleId=129350|title='Jingbirok' records 7-yr invasion|publisher=Korea.net|accessdate=2016-01-18|date=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The writing of the Jingbirok==

===Ryu Seong-ryong===
{{main article|Ryu Seong-ryong}}
Ryu Seong-ryong (1542–1607) was born in [[Uiseong]], in [[Gyeongsang]] province, during the Korean [[Joseon|Joseon Dynasty]], to a [[yangban]] family of the Pungsan Ryu clan. Passing the ''Samsai'' level of the [[Gwageo]] civil service examination in 1564, and the ''Mungwa'' level in 1566, Ryu rose through the ranks of the scholar-official bureaucracy  holding various positions including ''[[Jwauijeong]]'' (Second State Councillor) and ''[[Six Ministries of Joseon|Ijo Panseo]]'' (Minister of Personnel). At the time of the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|1592 Japanese invasion of Korea]] Ryu held the position of a provincial ''Dochechalsa''. During the war Ryu was appointed ''[[Yeonguijeong]]'' (First State Councillor), and it was in this capacity that he helped direct the Joseon defences, being responsible for all Joseon military units and leaders, including [[Yi Sun-sin]] and [[Gwon Yul]].

After the war in 1598, Ryu was ousted from office by factional infighting, although he was later rehabilitated he refused to serve again in high office. The ''Jingbirok'' was written and compiled at this time by Ryu in his home village, now  preserved in the [[Hahoe Folk Village]], in today's [[Andong]], [[North Gyeongsang Province]].

===Aim of the Jingbirok===
Ryu Seong-ryong wrote the ''Jingbirok'' in order to prevent such an invasion from happening again, reflecting on the mistakes.&lt;ref name="koreanet" /&gt; In the preface he writes that during the conflict the Joseon state suffered "the loss of three capitals, and collapse everywhere" (三都失守，八方瓦解) reflecting on his own role in this he wrote that he was "not up to the task the nation entrusted, the ills that nation suffered was because of threats not grasped, this cannot be swept away, nor can death atone for this guilt" (無似受國重任，於流離板蕩之際，危不持，顛不扶，罪死無赦). Ryu placed the blame for the disaster suffered by Joseon on his own inadequate emphasis on [[national security]], and was therefore resolved to properly document hard lessons dearly paid for, with the hope that following generations could avoid the mistakes that he had made. Although the ''Jingbirok'' includes details of Japanese atrocities, the focus of the ''Jingbirok'' is on Joseon failures, and Ryu is harsher in his assessment of his own side than he is of the enemy.

==Publication history==
The ''Jingbirok'' was written in [[Hanmun]], therefore it was as equally accessible to the classically educated scholars of China, Japan and Vietnam as it was to classically educated Koreans.

===Structure===
The early form of the ''Jingbirok''  was completed by the time of the 37th year of [[Seonjo of Joseon|King Seonjo]]'s reign (1604) and consisted of sixteen [[scroll]]s and a coda:

*Scrolls One and Two, are written in the form of an [[annal]], being a [[chronology]] from 1586 to 1598 of events between the Joseon-[[Ming dynasty|Ming]] allies and the [[Japan]]ese
*Scrolls Three to Five, ''Roots'' (芹曝集), background leading up to the invasion
*Scrolls Six to Fourteen, ''Jin-Sa Records'' (辰巳錄), documents, orders and proclamations made by the author as prime minister&lt;ref group=notes&gt;''Jin-Sa Records'' (辰巳錄) is named after the [[Earthly Branches]] used to denote years in the [[Sexagenary cycle]], 1592 was Im-'''Jin''' (壬'''辰''') , 1593 Gye-'''Sa''' (癸'''巳''')&lt;/ref&gt;
*Scrolls Fifteen to Sixteen, ''Military transcripts'' (軍門謄錄), transcripts and the author's [[Letter (message)|correspondence]]  between 1595 and 1598 regarding the conflict
*Coda, ''A Record of the Crisis'' (亂後雜記), a record of events during the conflict

By 1633 (11th year of [[Injo of Joseon|King Injo's]] reign) this had evolved into a widely read two volume format known as the ''Seoaejip'' consisting of the ''Jingibrok'' and Ryu Seong-ryong's ''The Anthology of Seoae'' ({{Korean|hangul=서애집|hanja=西厓集)}}). In 1647 the ''Jingibrok'' was issued as a single stand alone volume.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4549">'''John Christopher Atkinson''' (1814–1900) was an English author, antiquary, and priest.

==Life==
Born on 9 May 1814 at [[Goldhanger]] in Essex,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.churchside1.plus.com/Goldhanger-past/Atkinson.htm&lt;/ref&gt; where his father was then curate, he was the son of John Atkinson and the grandson of Christopher Atkinson (d. 18 March 1795), fellow of [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]]. He was educated at [[Kelvedon]] in Essex, and admitted as a sizar to [[St. John's College, Cambridge]], on 2 May 1834, graduating B.A. in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=ATKN834JC|name=Atkinson, John Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atkinson was ordained deacon in 1841 as curate of [[Brockhampton, Herefordshire|Brockhampton]] in Herefordshire, and priest in 1842. He afterwards held a curacy in Scarborough. In 1847 he became domestic chaplain to [[William Dawnay, 7th Viscount Downe]], who in the same year presented him to the vicarage of [[Danby, North Yorkshire|Danby]], in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]], which he held till his death.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Atkinson, John Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atkinson's parish was in rural Yorkshire, and on his arrival he found that clerical duties had been neglected. He set himself to learn the history of his parish cure and to gain the friendship of his parishioners; and learned local legends and customs. In 1887 he received the honorary degree of D.C.L. from [[Durham University]], and in 1891 he was installed in the prebend of Holme in [[York Cathedral]]. In 1898 he received a grant of £100 a year from the [[civil list]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Atkinson died at The Vicarage, Danby, on 31 March 1900.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Atkinson is best known for ''Forty Years in a Moorland Parish'' (1891, second edition the same year). Comparisons have been made with Gilbert White's ''[[Natural History of Selborne]]'', and Hugh Miller's ''Scenes and Legends of the North of Scotland''.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1867 Atkinson prepared for the [[Philological Society]] ''A Glossary of the Dialect of the Hundred of Lonsdale'', which was published in the society's ''Transactions''. It was followed in 1868 by ''A Glossary of the Cleveland Dialect'', to which, for the [[English Dialect Society]], he made ''Additions'' in 1876. In 1872 he published the first volume of ''The History of Cleveland, Ancient and Modern'', London; part of a second volume appeared in 1877, but it was not completed. Other works were:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

* ''The Walks, Talks, Travels, and Exploits of two Schoolboys'', London, 1859, new edition 1892. 
* ''Play-hours and Half-holidays; or, Further Experiences of two Schoolboys'', London, 1860, new edition 1892. 
* ''Sketches in Natural History; with an Essay on Reason and Instinct'', London, 1861; new edition 1865.
* ''British Birds' Eggs and Nests popularly described'', London, 1861, new edition 1898.
* ''Stanton Grange; or. At a Private Tutor's'', London, 1864.
* ''Lost; or What came of a Slip from "Honour Bright"', London, 1870. 
* ''The Last of the Giant Killers'', London, 1891, new edition 1893. 
* ''Scenes in Fairy-land'', London, 1892.

He edited:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

* ''Cartularium Abbathiæ de Whiteby'' (Surtees Soc), 1879, 2 vols. 
* ''Quarter Sessions Records'' (North Riding Record Soc), 1883–92, 9 vols. 
* ''Lonsdale Glossary: Furness Coucher Book'' (Chetham Soc), 1886–7, 3 vols. 
* ''Cartularium Abbathiæ de Rievalle' (Surtees Soc), 1859.

He also contributed papers to archaeological societies, and in 1872 assisted [[Hensleigh Wedgwood]] in revising his ''Dictionary of English Etymology''.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Family==
Atkinson was married three times: first, at [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] on 11 December 1849, to Jane Hill (d. 2 April 1860), eldest daughter of John Hill Coulson of Scarborough ; secondly, on 1 February 1862, at Frome Selwood, to Georgina Mary, eldest daughter of Barlow Slade of North House, Frome ; and thirdly, on 28 April 1884 at Arncliff church, to Helen Georgina, eldest daughter of Douglas Brown, Q. C ., of Arncliff Hall, Northallerton. He had thirteen children.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Libramatic''' is a cloud-based library management [[software as a service|service provider]] based in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]

Libramatic allows [[librarian]]s to catalog library inventory by scanning an [[ISBN]] using a [[smartphone]]'s camera or by using a [[Barcode scanner|USB barcode scanner]] on a [[personal computer]].

Libramatic officially launched in July 2012 at a startup event in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=SiliconRepublic|title=Twelve-year-old entrepreneur wins crowds over at Dublin Beta start-up gathering|url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/start-ups/item/28613-twelve-year-old-entrepreneu|accessdate=8 December 2013|newspaper=SiliconRepublic|date=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By utilising a correlation of multiple online data sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Libramatic|title=Libramatic Product Description|url=http://libramatic.com/product/|publisher=Libramatic|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it searches for information on that book using an undisclosed algorithm and stores it allowing librarians to circulate books based on an [[ISBN]].

The use of online library management systems has increased drastically since the rise of "[[Cloud computing|cloud]]" technology. Many modern cloud-based solutions now allow automated cataloging by scanning a book's ISBN. This technology was pioneered by Libramatic, although it is currently in use by systems such as [[LibraryWorld]].

The '''Lieutenant of the Tower of London''' served directly under the [[Constable of the Tower]].  The office was appointed at least since the 13th century.  There were formerly many privileges, immunities and perquisites attached to the office. Like the Constable, the [[Lieutenant]] was usually appointed by [[letters patent]], either for life or during the King's pleasure.{{sfn|Bayley|1825|p=664}}

The Lieutenants had custody of many eminent prisoners of state, including [[Anne Boleyn]], [[Sir Thomas More]], [[Lady Jane Grey]], [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]] (later Queen Elizabeth I) and [[Sir Walter Raleigh]].  At least five of the Lieutenants, Sir [[Edward Warner (1511–1565)|Edward Warner]],{{sfn|Croly|2004}} Sir [[Gervase Helwys]],{{sfn|Bellany|2004}} [[Isaac Penington (Lord Mayor)|Isaac Penington]],{{sfn|Lindley|2004}} [[Robert Tichborne|Colonel Robert Tichborne]],{{sfn|Lindley 27430|2004}} and [[Sir Edward Hales, 3rd Baronet|Sir Edward Hales]],{{sfn|Hopkins|2004}} themselves later became prisoners in the Tower.

==History==

===Edward I to Henry VIII===
The earliest known Lieutenant was [[Giles de Oudenard]] at the beginning of the reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], while [[Antony Bek (bishop of Durham)|Anthony Bek]], later [[Bishop of Durham]], was Constable. The next Lieutenant of whom there is record was [[Ralph Bavant]], who served during [[Barons Cromwell|John de Crumwell's]] tenure as Constable.{{sfn|Bayley|1825|p=665}}

In the reign of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], Sir Roger Aston served as Lieutenant under William, Lord Bourchier, who was then Constable. Among their notable prisoners was [[James I of Scotland]].{{sfn|Bayley|1825|p=665}}
Sir Robert Scott served as Lieutenant in 1424 during the reign of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].{{sfn|Fleming|2008}}
During the reign of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], Richard Haute (died 8 April 1487) was Lieutenant from 1471 to 1473.{{sfn|Fleming|2004}}{{sfn|Richardson II|2011|p=597}}
[[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford]] was Constable in the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], at which time Sir John Digby was his Lieutenant.{{sfn|Bayley|1825|p=665}}

[[Image:St-Peter-Ad-Vincula.jpg|thumb|right|[[St. Peter ad Vincula (London)|St. Peter ad Vincula]], a chapel on [[Tower Green]], is the resting place of several of the Lieutenants of the Tower.]]
According to some sources, in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] Sir [[Thomas Lovell]] (died 25 May 1524) served as Lieutenant from [[Michaelmas]] 1512;{{sfn|Gunn|2004}} however according to other sources, he was Constable of the Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/lovell-sir-thomas-i-1450-1524 |chapter=Lovell, Sir Thomas I (by 1450-1524), of East Harling, Norfolk, and Elsing by Enfield, Middlesex |title=History of Parliament |accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the prisoners of state in Lovell's custody was the Pretender to the Crown, [[Lambert Simnel]].{{sfn|Gunn|2004}} The Lieutenant from 1513 to 1520 was Sir [[Richard Cholmondeley]] (died 1521).{{sfn|Baker|2004}} Cholmondeley held office during the [[Evil May Day]] riots of 1517.  During the riots, he furiously ordered the firing of some of the Tower's artillery at the city during rioting by gangs of young Londoners, who took control of London for several days, drawing the ire of the city elders.  In 1520, he resigned his post at the Tower due to ill health.  He died in March 1521 (1522 by the modern calendar system) in [[St Katharine's by the Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chamley |first=Benson |date=June 2003 |title=Sir Richard Cholmondeley, Cheshire's most famous unknown |journal=The Family History Society of Cheshire Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cholmondeley was succeeded by Sir [[Edmund Walsingham]],{{sfn|Robison|2004}} Sir William Sidney, Sir [[Anthony Knyvett (1507–1554)|Anthony Knyvet]], and Sir [[Walter Stonor]].{{sfn|Bayley|1825|p=665}} Walsingham had personal charge of a number of eminent prisoners of state during his tenure, among them the [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury|Countess of Salisbury]], [[Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle|Viscount Lisle]], [[Anne Boleyn]], [[John Fisher|Bishop John Fisher]] and Sir [[Thomas More]].{{sfn|Robison|2004}}&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/walsingham-sir-edmund-1480-1550 |chapter=Walsingham, Sir Edmund (by 1480-1550), of Scadbury, Chislehurst, Kent |title=History of Parliament |accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard Skeffington, son of Sir [[William Skeffington]] (died 31 December 1535) is also said to have served as Lieutenant during the reign of Henry VIII and to have invented an instrument of torture used in the Tower; however there appears to be no record of his appointment or tenure as Lieutenant.{{sfn|Lyons|2004}}

===Edward VI to Charles I===
During the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], Sir [[John Markham (Died 1559)|John Markham]] was appointed Lieutenant in 1549 but dismissed on 31 October 1551 for leniency towards his prisoners, including the [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Protector Somerset]] and Sir [[Michael Stanhope (died 1552)|Michael Stanhope]].{{sfn|Cameron|2004}} Sir [[Arthur Darcy]] also served briefly as Lieutenant during Edward VI's reign.{{sfn|Leedham-Green|2004}}{{sfn|Bayley|1825|p=665}} Sir [[Edward Warner (1511–1565)|Edward Warner]] was appointed Lieutenant in October 1552.{{sfn|Croly|2004}}

On 3 February 2017, an Egyptian national in France on a tourist visa was shot as he rushed a group of French soldiers guarding a principal entrance to the [[Louvre Museum]] in [[Paris]], France, attacking and injuring one soldier with a [[machete]]. The soldiers were patrolling the museum as part of [[Opération Sentinelle]], guarding the [[Carrousel du Louvre]], in which an underground shopping mall also serves as a gift shop, ticket sales office, and public entrance to the Museum.

The attacker, identified as Abdullah al-Hamahmy, was confirmed by French authorities to have shouted "[[Takbir|Allahu Akbar]]" during the attack, and although not having direct links, to have sympathised with and posted numerous messages on [[Twitter]] in support of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]], including calling for people to "fight in the cause of Allah and kill."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Le Louvre attack suspect denies acting under Isis orders after Twitter messages show support for 'Islamic state'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/le-louvre-attack-soldiers-machete-stabbing-abdallah-el-hamahmy-paris-isis-islamic-state-twitter-a7572291.html|work=The Independent|date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Suspect in Louvre attack says he did not get orders from Islamic state|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-shooting/suspect-in-louvre-attack-says-he-did-not-get-orders-from-islamic-state-idUSKBN15N2GF|agency=Reuters|date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Louvre attack: Suspect 'confirms' he is Egyptian Abdullah Hamamy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38895546|work=BBC News|date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==
The suspect, who was carrying two bags containing spray paint and two machetes, is alleged to have attacked and injured a soldier with a machete who was guarding the museum, shouting "Allahu Akbar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LOUVRE ATTACK: PARIS SOLDIER SHOOTS ATTACKER WHO SHOUTED 'ALLAHU AKBAR'|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/louvre-attack-paris-soldier-shoots-injures-knifeman-who-shouted-allahu-akhbar-552064?rm=eu|accessdate=3 February 2017|work=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MulhollandMachete"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mulholland|first1=Roy|title=Louvre 'terror attack': Soldier fires at man who 'shouted Allahu Akbar' as he attempted assault with machete - latest from Paris|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/03/paris-knife-attack-louvre-evacuated-police-reportedly-shoot/|accessdate=3 February 2017|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCsuspect"&gt;{{cite news|title=Louvre attack: Suspect 'confirms' he is Egyptian Abdullah Hamamy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38895546|accessdate=7 February 2017|publisher=BBC|date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KirbyTerrorPlot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ConditionWorsens"&gt;{{cite news|title=Condition of shot suspect in Louvre attack worsens|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/02/08/condition-shot-suspect-louvre-attack-worsens/97632894/|accessdate=8 February 2017|agency=AP|publisher=USA Today|date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another soldier on security patrol fired five shots at him, injuring him in the stomach.

==Suspect==
French authorities say that no group has claimed the attempted attack and no link to extremism was found during a search of the apartment. The suspect posted on his Twitter account in Arabic in the minutes before the failed attack in which he referred once to [[ISIL]] and also wrote, "In the name of Allah... for our brothers in Syria and fighters across the world".&lt;ref name="BBCsuspect"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4152">'''Meta-ethnicity''' is a relatively recent term (or [[neologism]]) occasionally used in academic literature or public discourse on [[ethnic studies]]. It describes a level of commonality that is wider ("[[meta-]]") and more general (i.e., might differ on specifics) than [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], but does not necessarily correspond to (and may actually transcend) [[nation]] or [[nationality]]. In colloquial discourse, it usually signifies a larger group of related [[ethnic group]]s who identify with each other.

An early use—possibly the first published in English—was an article in a 1984 [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] publication discussing identity in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Brook, Solomon, and Nikolai Cheboksarov. 1984. "Metaethnic Identities in Asia and Africa."  In ''Ethnocultural Development of African Countries''. Moscow: USSR Academy of Sciences. Pp. 49-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oranienstein Letters''' are a series of letters sent by [[William V, Prince of Orange]] in December 1801 from [[Schloss Oranienstein]] near [[Diez, Germany]]. William addressed them to 15 [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangist]] ex-[[regenten]] of the old [[Dutch Republic]], whom he advised to no longer stay out of government. This meant that some of his instructions given in the [[Kew Letters]], that urged resistance against the [[Flanders Campaign|French–Batavian invasion]], were no longer in effect. He and his son, [[William I of the Netherlands|William Frederick]], also recognised the [[Batavian Republic]] as legitimate, and renounced their [[stadtholder|hereditary stadtholderate]]. These were preconditions set by First Consul [[Napoleon]] of the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] for compensation for the loss of their possessions in the Netherlands, that had been confiscated by the Batavian Republic.&lt;ref name="EncWil5"&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v.

William V only decreed these letters after much hesitations, and he would later refuse to accept the [[Mediatisation|mediatised]] [[Fulda monastery]] and the [[Imperial Abbey of Corvey]] as compensation, but he agreed that William Frederick did, and thus became [[Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda|Prince of Nassau-Orange-Fulda]].&lt;ref name="EncWil5"/&gt;

'''Paul Parlette Orndorff Jr. ''' (born October 29, 1949)&lt;ref&gt;Born in 1949 per [[Intelius]] check of "Paul Orndorff" giving age of 58 as of June 29. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; is an American former [[professional wrestler]], best known for his appearances with the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) as '''"Mr. Wonderful" Paul Orndorff'''. Orndorff became a star in the 1980s WWF wrestling boom. Orndorff's feud with Hulk Hogan in 1985–1986 is a highlight of his career. Orndorff departed the WWF for WCW in early 1988. After retiring, Orndorff worked as a professional wrestling trainer. In 2011, Orndorff was diagnosed with cancer, but went through treatment and was declared cancer free by the end of 2011.

Orndorff started wrestling in 1976 after playing for one year in the [[World Football League]] and initially worked for a number of wrestling promotions in the southern states of the United States such as [[Continental Wrestling Association|Mid-Southern Wrestling]], Southeast Championship Wrestling, [[Mid-South Wrestling]] and [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]]. In 1983, he made his debut for the WWF, portraying a narcissistic bad guy and was part of the main event of the first ever [[WrestleMania]] show. He would later team up with WWF's top name, [[Hulk Hogan]], leading to a storyline where Orndorff turned on Hogan and the two had a high-profile feud. Orndorff suffered an arm injury during the time and retired for a number of years before returning in 1990, working primarily for WCW. In WCW he won several titles including the [[WCW World Television Championship]] as well as the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] with [[Paul Roma]] (as a team called [[Pretty Wonderful]]). His recurring arm issues due to the 1988 injury led Orndorff to retire in 2000. He was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame#2005|WWE Hall of Fame in 2005]]  and the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] [[NWA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] in 2009.

However, he did play for the [[Jacksonville Sharks (WFL)|Jacksonville Sharks]] of the [[World Football League]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Pressbox/8121/ut_hist.htm | title = Tampa Bay Football History Hetwork – Tampa Spartans History|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Pressbox/8121/ut_hist.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+07:18:21|archivedate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After one season in the WFL, he began training as a professional wrestler.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1976–1982)===
Paul Orndorff started wrestling in 1976 in [[Continental Wrestling Association|Mid-Southern Wrestling]] where he feuded with a young [[Jerry Lawler]]. Orndorff won his first wrestling title when he pinned Lawler for the [[Memphis Wrestling Southern Heavyweight Championship|Mid-Southern Heavyweight Title]] on June 7, 1977.&lt;ref name="Titles"&gt;{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan &amp; Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories  | publisher=Archeus Communications  | year=2006|edition=4th | isbn=0-9698161-5-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Orndorff lost the title back to Lawler before he left the Memphis territory. Orndorff began working for the NWA Tri-State promotion where he got involved in a feud with [[Ernie Ladd]]. The feud with Ladd saw Orndorff win the [[Mid-South North American Heavyweight Championship|NWA Tri-State North American Heavyweight Title]]&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; from Ernie Ladd on two occasions (on May 29, 1978&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; and again in June). Both times, Orndorff's reigns were short and were ended by Ladd.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;

After feuding with Ladd, Orndorff continued to make a name for himself in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) where he feuded with [[Bill Eadie|The Masked Superstar]]. During this time he became known as "The Brandon Bull", a nickname he had during his days as a football player. In December 1978, Paul Orndorff teamed with [[Jimmy Snuka]] to capture the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship|NWA World Tag Team titles]] from [[Baron von Raschke]] and [[Greg Valentine]].&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; The duo held on to the titles for five months before losing them to Baron von Raschke and his new partner [[Paul Jones (wrestler)|Paul Jones]] on April 28, 1978.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;

In 1979, Orndorff traveled to the Alabama territory's "Southeast Championship Wrestling." There, Orndorff worked mainly as a tag team competitor teaming with [[Dick Slater]] to win the [[CWF Tag Team Championship|NWA Southeast Tag Team Championship]] from the team of [[Bunkhouse Buck|Jimmy Golden]] and [[Norvell Austin]] in October 1979.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; Their reign only lasted about a month before being upended by the combination of [[Dennis Condrey]] and [[David Schultz (professional wrestler)|David Schultz]].&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; Orndorff then teamed with former opponent Norvell Austin (who was calling himself "The Junkyard Dog" at the time, not to be mistaken for the more famous [[Junkyard Dog]]) to win the titles in late 1979.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; The duo beat Dennis Condrey and [[Randy Rose]], the same team that ended Orndorff and Austin's run with the gold.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; Norvell Austin, Dennis Condrey, and Randy Rose would go on to form [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The Midnight Express]] shortly thereafter.

During 1980, Orndorff started to split his time between the Alabama and the Mid-South territories, until he left the Alabama territory by the end of 1980 to focus entirely on the Mid-South territory. In Mid-South, Orndorff feuded with Ken Mantell over Mantell's propensity for cutting people's hair after a match. Orndorff got the better of Mantell and won the rights to use the [[The Fabulous Freebirds|Freebird]] hair removal cream on Mantell. Orndorff earned a shot at the North American champion [[Len Denton|The Grappler]] but on the day of the match he overslept ([[Kayfabe|storyline]]) and was incensed when his replacement [[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]] beat the Grappler for the title.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; Orndorff's reaction to Jake's title win signaled a change in attitude; he [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|turned]] [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] as he demanded a title match against Jake "the Snake". While he lost the support of the fans, he won the North American title on July 4, 1981.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/midsouth/cards.html#0781 | title = Mid-South Wrestling – Superdome Extravaganza Results (7/1981) | accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orndorff feuded with [[Ted DiBiase]], JYD, [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], and [[Dick Murdoch]] while holding on to the North American title. Orndorff lost the title to Ted DiBiase on November 1, 1981 in a match at the Municipal Auditorium in New Orleans, Louisiana. Orndorff was unable to wrestle in the rematch due to car trouble, which meant that Orndorff's friend Bob Roop got the title shot and won the match.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; It was soon revealed that Roop had sabotaged Orndorff's car so he could get the title shot instead (storyline). Orndorff turned face to feud with Roop but found himself unable to regain the title&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/midsouth/cards.html#0582 | title = Mid-South Wrestling – Superdome Extravaganza Results (5/1982) | accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which he left the Mid-South Territory.

Orndorff reappeared in [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] in early 1982 immediately launching into a feud with [[Buzz Sawyer]] over the [[NWA National Heavyweight Championship]]. Orndorff won the gold on June 20, 1982.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; During the summer, Orndorff would vacate the title so he could focus on pursuing the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Champion]] [[Ric Flair|"Nature Boy" Ric Flair]].&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; Orndorff was unsuccessful in his challenge and soon focused on the title he gave up. When Orndorff vacated the title, it was put on the line in a tournament that was won by [[Scott Irwin|The Super Destroyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/georgia/gasingle.html#national82 | title = Georgia Championship Wrestling – Tournament Results (National Title Tournament 1982) | accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 19, 1982, Paul Orndorff regained the title from the Super Destroyer.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; Orndorff next feuded with The Masked Superstar, with whom he traded the National Heavyweight title back and forth during the fall of 1982.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; Orndorff then traded the title back and forth with Super Destroyer.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; Frustrated with his inability to beat Paul Orndorff for the National title, [[Larry Zbyszko]] paid [[Killer Tim Brooks]] $25,000 to do his dirty work. Brooks beat Orndorff with the help of a chair and won the title only to turn around and give it to Zbyszko. The fact that Zybszko bought the title and did not win it forced NWA President [[Bob Geigel]] to step in and strip Zbyszko of the title.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;

Orndorff then moved to New Japan Pro Wrestling for several months. He made two tours of Japan, the first in April. He wrestled [[Kengo Kimura]], [[Riki Choshu]], and [[Akira Maeda]], as well as teaming up with [[Brutus Beefcake|Ed Leslie]] against [[Antonio Inoki]] and [[Seiji Sakaguchi]]. Orndorff returned in October and partnered with Big John Studd against Maeda and Sakaguchi, then faced Maeda again in singles competition.

Orndorff signed with the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] in late 1983 and made his debut in November of that year on Championship Wrestling. Starting in January 1984, Orndorff took on [[Roddy Piper|"Rowdy" Roddy Piper]] as his manager.&lt;ref name="WWE80s"&gt;{{cite book | author=Brian Shields | title=Main event – WWE in the raging 80s| publisher=Pocket Books| year=2006|edition=4th | isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Piper nicknamed Paul Orndorff "Mr. Wonderful", a nickname that he has used ever since. Orndorff made his WWF debut against [[Salvatore Bellomo]] on the night that [[Hulk Hogan]] defeated [[The Iron Sheik]] for the [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Title]] and "Hulkamania was born", January 23, 1984 in [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name="WWE80s"/&gt; Orndorff became one of the first people to challenge for the world title, shooting straight to the main event less than a month after his debut.&lt;ref name="Graham Cawthon"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/84.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1984 | accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = Graham Cawthon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan disposed of the challenger and moved on while Orndorff fought a variety of opponents including the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]] [[Tito Santana]].&lt;ref name="Graham Cawthon"/&gt; When Piper assaulted Jimmy Snuka on the set of ''[[Piper's Pit]]'', Orndorff assisted the Rowdy One in his matches. Orndorff and Piper often faced Snuka and "[[Sam Fatu|The Tonga Kid]]" in tag team competition.&lt;ref name="Graham Cawthon"/&gt;

Near the end of 1984, Roddy Piper's assault on [[Cyndi Lauper]] ([[kayfabe]]) brought Orndorff and Piper on a collision course with Hulk Hogan and [[Mr. T]].&lt;ref name="WWE80s"/&gt; Hogan's feud with Piper also meant that Orndorff was thrust back into the main event picture; he defeated [[Tony Atlas]] at ''[[The War to Settle the Score]]'' and then played a part in the main event.&lt;ref name="WWE80s"/&gt; The fallout from ''The War to Settle the Score'' led to the creation of [[WrestleMania]], with Hogan and Mr. T (backed by Jimmy Snuka) taking on "Rowdy" Roddy Piper and Paul Orndorff in the main event (with [[Bob Orton, Jr]], as Piper and Orndorff's manager) Orton's interference at the end of the match backfired when he accidentally hit Orndorff with the cast on his arm, allowing Hogan to pin Orndorff and win the match for his team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/mania.html#I | title = WWE WrestleMania Results (I) | accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blaming Orndorff for the loss, Piper and Orton attacked him on the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]''. Later in the evening, Orndorff ran to the ring to even the sides when Piper and Orton were preparing to double team Hulk Hogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/snme.html#1 | title = WWE Saturday Night's Main Event Results (I) | accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He solidified his babyface status by publicly firing manager [[Bobby Heenan]] shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="WWE80s"/&gt;

Orndorff and Hogan started teaming up to feud with Piper and Orton, facing them in tag team competition all over the country.&lt;ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/85.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1985 | accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = Graham Cawthon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orndorff's feud with Piper and Orton continued to rage on while Hogan started to defend his title against other contenders; Orndorff faced both Orton&lt;ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/&gt; and Piper&lt;ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/&gt; in individual competition, usually without a conclusive outcome. After Orndorff fired Bobby Heenan as his manager, Heenan placed a $25,000 bounty on Orndorff, payable to anyone who could injure him.&lt;ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/&gt; When no one succeeded, Heenan upped the bounty to $50,000.&lt;ref name="WWE80s"/&gt; One of the first men to try and claim the new, higher bonus was Roddy Piper himself, but their matches got so out of hand that [[Bruno Sammartino]] was appointed as a special referee in the hopes of keeping peace. Instead of keeping peace, Sammartino became a target for Orton and Piper,&lt;ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/&gt; which led to Orndorff and Sammartino teaming up. Orndorff teamed with a variety of opponents in his fights with Piper and Orton, including [[André the Giant]].&lt;ref name="WWE80s"/&gt; In February 1986, Bobby Heenan used a match between Hulk Hogan and [[Don Muraco]] as an opportunity to have [[King Kong Bundy]] attack Hogan, setting up their [[WrestleMania 2]] match. While Hogan fought off Bundy, Orndorff battled Don Muraco in a match that ended in a double count out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/mania.html#II | title = WWE WrestleMania Results (2) | accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orndorff's frustrations were further fueled by [[Adrian Adonis]], who took every opportunity that he could to mock Orndorff (including referring to him as "Hulk Jr."), saying that he had gone soft from teaming with Hogan. Adonis kept on irritating Orndorff, going so far as daring Paul Orndorff to prove just how close his relationship with Hulk Hogan really was. During a televised phone call to Hulk Hogan, Orndorff was told that Hogan was too busy training to come to the phone, something which aggravated Orndorff to no end.&lt;ref name="WWE80s"/&gt; The next time that Hogan and Orndorff teamed up, against [[The Moondogs (professional wrestling)|The Moondogs]], Orndorff wrestled most of the match by himself in an attempt to upstage Hogan, scoring the winning pin.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/86.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1986 | accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = Graham Cawthon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next week, during a tag match where Hogan and Orndorff faced the massive duo of [[Big John Studd]] and King Kong Bundy, Hogan and Orndorff accidentally collided and Hogan knocked Orndorff off the apron. When Studd and Bundy started to double team Hogan, Orndorff did not help out; he looked like he had hurt his eye in the collision. It was not until Studd and Bundy had Hogan in a compromised position that Orndorff reentered the ring to fend off Studd and Bundy. Orndorff then helped Hogan to his feet and raised his hand in the air, only to give Hogan a clothesline followed by a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]].&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;

Orndorff soon reunited with manager Bobby Heenan and again feuded with Hulk Hogan, and began using Hogan's theme music, "Real American", as his own entrance theme. Their matches included a memorable outdoor match in Toronto which drew an estimated 76,000 fans.&lt;ref name="WWE80s"/&gt; After a series of matches with no clean outcome it was decided that Hogan and Orndorff would clash in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]] on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]''. The cage match saw both Orndorff and Hogan climb over the top of the cage and touch the floor at the same time. After reviewing the footage it was decided that it was a draw and the match was restarted. Once the match restarted, Hogan easily exited the cage to win the match following a [[leg drop]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/snme.html#9 | title = WWE Saturday Night's Main Event Results (#9) | accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ending their feud. Their half-year-long feud is one of the most notable (and profitable) feuds in the history of pro wrestling.&lt;ref name="WWE80s"/&gt;

During the Hogan feud, Orndorff seriously injured his right arm in a weightlifting accident. Because he was in the middle of his big money run with Hogan, he did not want to take the time off to have the surgery to properly treat it, opting instead to continue to wrestle.&lt;ref name="WWE80s"/&gt; After the program with Hogan ended, Orndorff worked a reduced schedule for a few months before he was forced to take some time off because of the injury. While Orndorff was away from the WWF, Bobby Heenan brought in a new man [[Rick Rude|"Ravishing" Rick Rude]] to take Orndorff's place in the Heenan Family. Orndorff returned to the ring on June 2, 1987 in Buffalo, New York during a WWF Superstars taping. Orndorff (along with King Kong Bundy, who had been off TV since WrestleMania III as well) returned to team with Hercules and King Harley Race in a victory against Mario Mancini, Don Driggers, Paul Roma, and Jim Powers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Orndorff received a babyface response from the crowd during his return, leading the WWF to change his character. He would fire Bobby Heenan two months later and begin a feud with Rick Rude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1987 | accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = Graham Cawthon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orndorff took [[Oliver Humperdink]] as his manager in his fight with Rude and Heenan. Orndorff's last "big" appearance was at the inaugural [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] on November 26, 1987, where he teamed with Hulk Hogan, [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], [[Ken Patera]], and [[Don Muraco]] to take on André the Giant, the One Man Gang, King Kong Bundy, Rick Rude, and [[Butch Reed]]. Early in the match, Rude eliminated Orndorff with a [[pin (professional wrestling)#Roll-up|roll-up]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/survivor.html#87 | title = WWE Survivor Series Results (1987) | accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final match came on a house show on January 4, 1988 against Rick Rude in Augusta, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/88.htm | title=Ring Results 1988 | publisher=The History of WWE | first=Graham | last=Cawthon | accessdate=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semi-retirement and return (1988–1990)===
Paul Orndorff retired in early 1988 due to his arm injury and focused on running his [[bowling]] alley in Fayetteville. During his time away from wrestling he was actually reported to have died; the story made several newspapers. The time off was because of the injury to his arm/neck that he suffered during the Hogan feud and left untreated for too long.&lt;ref name="WWE80s"/&gt; With the time off, Orndorff recovered and started working out, reestablishing the physique that earned him the nickname "Mr. Wonderful" in the first place. The only difference was that his right arm was noticeably smaller and weakened due to a neck injury that caused nerve damage and eventually the atrophy of his right biceps.

In 1990 Orndorff returned to the squared circle, wrestling a series of matches against [[Kerry Von Erich]] on the [[independent circuit]].&lt;ref name="WWE80s"/&gt;

===NWA World Championship Wrestling (1990)===
On the May 26 episode of ''World Championship Wrestling'' it was announced that Paul Orndorff would be facing Arn Anderson at [[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XI: Coastal Crush|Clash of the Champions XI]]. Orndorff made his in-ring debut on June 9 in Beckley, West Virginia, defeating "Nasty" Ned Brady on ''[[WCW Main Event|Main Event]]''. Orndorff quickly became affiliated with a group called the "Dudes with Attitudes" consisting of himself, [[Steve Borden|Sting]], [[Lex Luger]], [[Junkyard Dog]], and [[The Steiner Brothers]]. The Dudes backed Sting in his fight with the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]]. At Clash of the Champions XI Orndorff defeated Anderson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html#XI |title=WCW Clash of the Champions Results (XI) |accessdate=April 16, 2007 |author=prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[The Great American Bash (1990)|1990 Great American Bash]], Orndorff teamed up with the Junkyard Dog and [[Jorge González (wrestler)|El Gigante]] to defeat Arn Anderson, [[Barry Windham]], and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]] by disqualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/gabash.html#90 |title=WCW Great American Bash Results (1990) |accessdate=April 16, 2007 |author=prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the summer Orndorff would face Anderson and defeat the WCW TV Champion by pinfall in several non-title matchups. He also defeated [[The Undertaker|"Mean" Mark Callous]] in multiple house show encounters. His final WCW match came on August 26 in Chicago when he teamed with The Junkyard Dog in a losing effort against the tag-team champions [[Doom (professional wrestling)|Doom]]. Orndorff departed from the promotion that fall.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw90.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent circuit (1990–1993)===
By late 1990, Orndorff became one of the featured headliners for [[Herb Abrams]]' fledgling [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)|Universal Wrestling Federation]].&lt;ref name="WWE80s"/&gt; Televised on several cable outlets, the UWF saw many former WWF stars such as Don Muraco, Bob Orton, Jr., "Superfly" Jimmy Snuka, [[Lou Albano]], and [[The Killer Bees (professional wrestling)|The Killer Bees]] (known as "Masked Confusion" in the UWF). Mr. Wonderful more or less immediately started feuding with [["Dr. Death" Steve Williams]], who attacked Orndorff to kick start the feud. Orndorff and Williams clashed several times in what was promoted as the "Signature Feud" of the UWF in its early days. Orndorff would also reignite his feud with Bob Orton, Jr. in the UWF, where he beat Orton for the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF Southern States Championship|UWF Southern States Championship]] on June 22, 1992 and held the title until he left the promotion, it was awarded back to Orton when Orndorff left the promotion.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; On June 9, 1991, Orndorff competed on the UWF's only PPV [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)#Results|Beach Brawl]], defeating [[Colonel DeBeers]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Strap match|Strap match]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/abrams.html#beach | title = UWF Show Results (Beach Brawl) | accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orndorff left the UWF sometime in early 1993, vacating the Southern States title.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;

While working for the UWF, Orndorff would also compete in the American Wrestling Federation (not the same promotion as the [[American Wrestling Federation|AWF]]) and held the AWF Heavyweight title after beating [[Stan Lane]] on December 16, 1991. When Orndorff left the AWF in February 1992, he vacated the title.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; During this time Orndorff also competed in the National Wrestling League, holding its tag team titles alongside [[Brian Blair]] sometime in 1993.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;

===Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1992)===
In 1992, [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] opened its doors for the first time as they announced a tournament to crown the first [[SMW Heavyweight Championship|SMW Heavyweight Champion]]. Among the participants invited to compete were [[Buddy Landel]], "Dirty White Boy" [[Tony Anthony (wrestler)|Tony Anthony]], and [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|Brian Lee]]. Orndorff was only listed as a "wild card" who had to win a match in order to enter the tournament. The "wild card" status was a blow to Orndoff's ego (storyline), causing him to attack several wrestlers including [[Hector Guerrero]], whom he defeated in a "wild card" match to earn a spot in the tournament. Afterwards, Orndorff laid out Guerrero and several preliminary wrestlers with his piledriver finisher. Orndoff beat [[Tim Horner]]&lt;ref name="SMW1"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/smw/results/1992b.html#052292 | title = SMW Show Results April – June 1992 (May 22)| accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Gibson (wrestler)|Robert Gibson]]&lt;ref name="SMW1"/&gt; in the preliminary rounds to advance to the finals of the tournament. In the finals, Brian Lee won the title when Orndorff was disqualified.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SMW1"/&gt;

Siding with the "Dirty White Boy" Tony Anthony, Orndorff feuded with Hector Guerrero and Brian Lee. Lee brought in [[Ron Garvin]] to fight off Orndorff;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/smw/results/1992c.html#071792 | title = SMW Show Results July – September 1992 (July 17)| accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the feud included a very publicized "piledriver" match which was won by Garvin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/smw/results/1992c.html#080892 | title = SMW Show Results July – September 1992 ("Fire on the Mountain" August 8)| accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orndorff was "fired" from the SMW after piledriving a referee in frustration.

===Return to WCW (1992–2000)===
==== World Television Champion (1992&amp;ndash;1993) ====
Orndorff returned to WCW in late 1992. In January 1993 he took on [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]], with the winner being manager [[Harley Race]]'s chosen replacement for an injured Rick Rude at the ''[[Clash of the Champions]]''. Race assisted Orndorff in the match and was quickly joined by [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] in his attack on Cactus Jack. After the match, Race declared that Paul Orndorff was his chosen man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= [[Mick Foley]]| title= [[Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks]] | publisher=Regan Books | year= 1999 | isbn=0-06-039299-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orndorff was pinned by Cactus Jack in a subsequent [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Thunderdome match]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXII| title = WCW Clash of the Champions Results (XXII)| accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080624035919/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXII| archivedate = June 24, 2008| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the two had an intense feud including a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|Falls Count Anywhere match]] at [[SuperBrawl III]], which Cactus Jack won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/s-brawl.html#III | title = WCW SuperBrawl Results (III)| accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the feud with Cactus cooled off, "Mr. Wonderful" set his sights on the vacant [[WCW World Television Championship]]. Orndorff signed up for a 16-man tournament beating [[2 Cold Scorpio]], Cactus Jack, [[Marc Mero|Johnny B. Badd]], and then [[Erik Watts]] in the finals to win his first title in WCW.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; Orndorff, the TV champion, and Rick Rude, the [[WWE United States Championship|U.S. Champion]], began teaming on a regular basis, including a PPV victory over [[Dustin Rhodes]] and [[Kensuke Sasaki]] at [[Slamboree (1993)|Slamboree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/slambore.html#93 | title = WCW Slamboree Results (1993)| accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Orndorff also turned back the challenges of [[Ron Simmons]] and Marcus Alexander Bagwell, amongst others, holding on to his Television title by any means necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/miscppv.html#blast93 | title = WCW Beach Blast Results (1993)| accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orndorff defeated Bagwell controversially, using the second rope for leverage during the pinfall. The two would later go on to feud for the WCW World Tag Team Titles. Orndorff's World TV Title reign also included a successful defence against future ECW champion Shane Douglas and a disqualification loss to Johnny B Badd, after [[Maxx Payne]] violently interfered. This led to a brief six man tag team alliance between Orndorff, Payne, and [[Chris Benoit]]. On August 18, 1993, Orndorff's luck ran out as [[Ricky Steamboat]] won the title at ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXIV|Clash of the Champions XXIV]]''.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXIV| title = WCW Clash of the Champions Results (XXIV)| accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080624035919/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXIV| archivedate = June 24, 2008| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After unsuccessfully challenging Ricky Steamboat throughout the fall and winter of 1993, Orndorff moved into the tag team division.

====Pretty Wonderful (1993–1995)====
{{main article|Pretty Wonderful}}
After the 1993 WCW pay-per-view [[Battlebowl]], Horsemen members [[Paul Roma]] and [[Arn Anderson]] faced the semi-regular team of Paul Orndorff and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|"Stunning" Steve Austin]] on ''[[WCW Saturday Night]]''. During the match, Roma acted very indifferent to his tag team partner, sowing the seeds to his heel turn. Next, Roma teamed with [[Erik Watts]] to take on the team of Orndorff and [[William Regal|Lord Steven Regal]]. This time, Roma took it a step further and attacked Erik Watts before announcing that he was now teaming with Paul Orndorff.

Under the tutelage of manager [[Jody Hamilton|Masked Assassin]], the team quickly began to work well together in a feud with [[Buff Bagwell|Marcus Alexander Bagwell]] and [[2 Cold Scorpio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/starrcad.html#93 | title = WCW Starrcade Results (1993) | accessdate = April 7, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXVI | title = WCW Clash of the Champions Results (XXVI) | accessdate = April 7, 2007 | author = prowrestlinghistory.com | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080624035919/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXVI | archivedate = June 24, 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following months, both Roma and Orndorff focused on their individual careers before reuniting around May. This time they wrestled without their manager and were officially known as "Pretty Wonderful". With both men rededicated to teaming, they soon challenged for the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] then held by [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] and [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]]. One incident especially stands out that established Pretty Wonderful in the title chase. The champions had one last defense against former champions [[the Nasty Boys]] that also saw Kevin's injured brother [[Dave Sullivan (wrestler)|Dave]]. The match degraded into a brawl that saw Pretty Wonderful make an appearance using Dave's crutch to attack the champions. Before the team left the ring, they also took a couple of shots at the Nasty Boys for good measure.

Going into [[Bash at the Beach (1994)|Bash at the Beach]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/beach.html#94 | title = WCW Bash at the Beach Results (1994) | accessdate =April 7, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pretty Wonderful had the advantage as both champions were suffering from injuries inflicted by the challengers on previous occasions (kayfabe). Cactus Jack and Kevin Sullivan were unable to hold off Roma and Orndorff, as Pretty Wonderful left the ring with the gold.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Mick Foley | title = Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-06-103101-1 | page = 277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pretty Wonderful was immediately challenged by the Nasty Boys after winning the title, but the Nasty Boys were never able to take the gold from the champions. Next, Pretty Wonderful was challenged by the duo of [[Stars and Stripes (professional wrestling)|Stars and Stripes]] (Marcus Alexander Bagwell and [[The Patriot (wrestler)|The Patriot]]) at [[Fall Brawl (1994)|Fall Brawl]]. The champions retained,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/fall.html#94 | title = WCW Fall Brawl Results (1994) | accessdate =April 7, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a week later the championship changed hands when Stars and Stripes got the victory.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; Pretty Wonderful was granted a rematch against the new champions with a match booked for [[Halloween Havoc (1994)|Halloween Havoc]]; Pretty Wonderful regained the titles when Roma used one of the title belts to knock Bagwell out cold.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;

During a February 5, 1995 taping of WCW Worldwide, Orndorff crossed paths with Hogan for the first time since 1987. The duo of Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage faced Pretty Wonderful in a televised match which the latter lost. This would be the only time that Orndorff and Hogan would be matched against each other during the latter's WCW run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw95.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXIX|Clash of the Champions XXIX]] Stars and Stripes were granted a final shot at the tag team title, but the challengers also had to put up the Patriot's mask on the line. After a controversial double pin finish, Stars and Stripes were declared the winners and thus the champions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXIX| title = WCW Clash of the Champions Results (XXIX)| accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080624035919/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXIX| archivedate = June 24, 2008| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; putting the end to Pretty Wonderful's second and final run with the gold.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;

====Retirement (1995&amp;ndash;2000)====
Orndorff returned to singles competition with his most notable match at the time being an unsuccessful shot at the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]] when he faced champion [[Keiji Mutoh|the Great Muta]] at [[Slamboree (1995)|Slamboree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/slambore.html#95 | title = WCW Slamboree Results (1995)| accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, Orndorff got a golden opportunity to regain the WCW Television title. He defeated [[Brian Pillman]] in a tournament to earn the shot at the champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw95.htm | title = WCW Show Results 1995 | accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = Graham Cawthon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost to WCW newcomer [[Rick Wilson (wrestler)|The Renegade]] at [[Bash at the Beach (1995)|Bash at the Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/beach.html#95 | title = WCW Bash at the Beach Results (1995)| accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orndorff was also unable to beat the rookie in subsequent matches and began to lose confidence in his abilities ([[kayfabe|storyline]]). After losing more and more matches, including a match on ''[[WCW WorldWide|WorldWide]]'' to [[Randy Savage]], Orndorff lost all faith in his abilities; the outwardly arrogant Mr. Wonderful was riddled with self-doubt, until one night, after beating himself up backstage after yet another loss, he was visited by psychic [[Gary Spivey]]. Spivey convinced Orndorff to believe in himself and that he shouldn’t forget that he was "Mr. Wonderful".&lt;ref name="WrestleCrap"&gt;{{cite book | author=RD Reynolds and Randy Baer | title=Wrestlecrap – the very worst of pro wrestling | publisher=ECW Press| year=2003 | isbn=1-55022-584-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Orndorff became more arrogant than ever before and began carrying around a mirror everywhere he went.

On the December 11, 1995 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'', Orndorff confronted Brian Pillman after Pillman made derogatory comments about Orndorff. After telling Flair and Anderson how much he respected them, Orndorff told Pillman that he could have been a Horseman and the only reason Pillman was a Horseman was because he turned it down. Anderson and Flair tried to calm Orndorff down but Orndorff lost his temper and attacked Pillman. Pillman, Flair, and Anderson attacked Orndorff and then Arn Anderson and Ric Flair delivered a spike piledriver to Orndorff on the arena floor during the attack. WCW later explained that Orndorff had been seriously hurt in the attack and that his career was over. In actuality, Orndorff was forced to retire due to his previous injuries in the WWF, with the entire right side of his body beginning to [[atrophy]] (eventually causing his arm and leg muscles to shrink). It was something he had worked through as best he could but by the end of 1995 he was forced to retire and started to work as a trainer and a road agent for WCW.&lt;ref name="WWE80s"/&gt; At the [[Fall Brawl (2000)|2000 Fall Brawl]], in a match between The Filthy Animals and The Natural Born Thrillers, Orndorff suffered a neck injury after delivering a piledriver. The referee, Charles Robinson stopped the match as a result.

===Retirement (2000–present)===
After Orndorff retired he began to run the [[WCW Power Plant]], where he trained several wrestlers including [[The Natural Born Thrillers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/paulorndorff/ | title = WWE Hall of Fame: Paul Orndorff | accessdate = April 16, 2007| author = wwe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a brief onscreen role during this time in the Old Age Outlaws with [[Terry Funk]], [[Arn Anderson]], and [[Larry Zbyszko]] to feud with the last WCW version of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]].

On February 3, 2005, Orndorff was announced as one of the inductees for the Class of 2005 into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]]. He was inducted on April 2 at the [[Universal Amphitheatre]] in Los Angeles by [[Bobby Heenan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/paulorndorff/profile/ | title = WWE Hall of Fame: Paul Orndorff | accessdate =April 7, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Orndorff was elected by a committee of his peers to the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]], then located in Amsterdam New York, now located in Wichita Falls, Texas.

On April 6, 2014, Orndorff made an appearance at [[WrestleMania XXX]]. Marking the first time being on WWE television since the 2005 Hall of Fame. He appeared with Rowdy Roddy Piper, Hulk Hogan, Mr. T, Pat Patterson who was part of the main event at the first WrestleMania and [[Gene Okerlund]] who was conducting an interview with Hogan when the rest appeared.

On August 11, 2014, Orndorff made an appearance at Hulk Hogan's birthday celebration on ''[[WWE Raw]]'', celebrating in the ring with many other WWE legends, including Hogan himself, [[Ric Flair]], [[Kevin Nash]], [[Scott Hall]], [[Gene Okerlund]], [[Jimmy Hart]], and [[Roddy Piper]].

On May 3, 2017, Orndorff fought in his first match since 2000. The event was a CWE (Canadian Wrestling's Elite) held in [[Brandon, Manitoba]], Canada. Where he won in a 6-man tag team match at age 67.

==Personal life==
Paul's parents are both of [[Germans|German]] descent. Orndorff currently resides in [[Fayetteville, Georgia]]. He married his high school girlfriend Ronda Maxwell Orndorff. The couple have two grown sons, Paul Orndorff III and Travis Orndorff, as well as eight grandchildren. Paul has a younger brother Ray, who competed on the independent circuit. He also has another brother named Terry, with whom he wrestled briefly as a tag team in the early 1980s. Terry went on to have limited success as a tag team wrestler with other partners such as [[Sylvester Ritter|The Junkyard Dog]] and [[Kerry Von Erich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/bios/t/terry-orndorff/|title=Terry Orndorff|work=Online World of Wrestling|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul has a sister Patricia and a niece Brandy Orndorff. Brandy has a husband named Richard Cusumano, whom she has 5 children with. He has a nephew Terry Orndorff Jr.

On January 5, 2011, Paul Orndorff appeared on the ''Busted Open'' radio show on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] and revealed that he had recently been diagnosed with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Other_News_4/article_46549.shtml | title = Other News: 1980s WWF headliner Paul Orndorff reveals he has cancer; flashback to June 2010 interview on his physical condition | date=2011-01-05 | accessdate = 2011-01-06 | last=Caldwell | first=James | work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 2011, Orndorff announced that he was now cancer free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/96-wwe/21688-wed-update-world-champ-signing-memphis-makes-daily-show-hogan-edge-summerslam-and-ufc | title = Wed. update: World champ signing, Memphis makes Daily Show, Hogan, Edge, SummerSlam and UFC | date=2011-08-10 | accessdate = 2011-08-11 | last=Meltzer | first=Dave | authorlink=Dave Meltzer | work=[[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Orndorff was named part of a [[class action]] lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred "long term neurological injuries" and that the company "routinely failed to care" for them and "fraudulently misrepresented and concealed" the nature and extent of those injuries.  The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/breaking/ct-wwe-cte-lawsuit-20160719-story.html|title=Dozens of wrestlers sue WWE over CTE, effects of traumatic brain injuries|last=Bieler|first=Des|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=July 20, 2016|date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, US District Judge [[Vanessa Lynne Bryant]] dismissed the case, ruling that some of the suit's claims were frivolous and some had been filed after the statute of limitations had expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2018/09/19/lawsuit-against-wwe-concussions-thrown-out/| title= Judge throws out lawsuit against WWE by ex-pro wrestlers over concussions|last=Collins|first=Dave|work= [[The Denver Post]] |accessdate=October 22, 2018| date= September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''public recursive name server''' (also called '''public DNS resolver''') is a [[name server]] service that networked computers may use for query to [[DNS]], the decentralized Internet naming system, in place of or in addition to name servers operated by the [[Internet service provider]] to which the devices are connected. Reasons for using these services include:

* speed, compared to using ISP DNS services&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.techworm.net/2016/08/change-default-dns-google-dns-fast-internet-speeds.html|title=How to Change Your Default DNS to Google DNS for Fast Internet Speeds|date=2016-08-20|newspaper=TechWorm|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* filtering (security, ad-blocking, porn-blocking, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itbusiness.ca/news/a-simple-way-to-get-around-rogers-dns-re-directing/12025|title=A simple way to get around Rogers’ DNS re-directing|newspaper=IT Business|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* reporting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mspmentor.net/managed-services/110415/opendns-adds-centralized-reporting-ip-layer-enforcement-umbrella|title=OpenDNS Adds Centralized Reporting, IP-Layer Enforcement to Umbrella|website=mspmentor.net|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* avoiding censorship&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://torrentfreak.com/austrian-pirate-bay-blockade-censors-slovak-internet-accidentally-151203/|title=Austrian Pirate Bay Blockade Censors Slovak Internet - TorrentFreak|date=2015-12-03|newspaper=TorrentFreak|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* redundancy (smart caching)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/21/dns_devastation_as_dyn_dies_under_denialofservice_attack/|title=DNS devastation: Top websites whacked offline as Dyn dies again|last=Security|last2=Iana|access-date=2016-10-22|last3=Icann|last4=Fcc|last5=Google|last6=again|first6=DNS devastation: Top websites whacked offline as Dyn dies|last7=dates|first7=Coming soon to smart home devices?

* access to unofficial [[alternative top level domain]]s not found in the official [[DNS root zone]]

Public DNS resolver operators often cite increased privacy as an advantage of their services; critics of public DNS services have cited the possibility of mass data collection targeted at the public resolvers as a potential risk of using these services. Several services now support secure DNS lookup transport services such as [[DNS over HTTPS]] and [[DNS over TLS]].

Public DNS resolvers are operated either by commercial companies, offering their service for free use to the public, or by private enthusiasts to help spread new technologies and support non-profit communities.

In '''''S v Vermaas;  S v Du Plessis''''' (1995), the accused were charged with multiple counts of [[fraud]]. The main contention in this case was regarding the [[adjudication]] and referral of constitutional matters by the Transvaal Provincial Division, but the court also very briefly discussed the [[Right to counsel|right to legal representation]].

The court held that, where a [[Lawyer|legal representative]] is appointed for an accused at the expense of the State in terms of section 25(3)(e) of the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]], no right in the accused to pick the lawyer appointed for him can be derived from that subsection.

'''''Satchwell v President of the Republic of South Africa and Another''''' is a 2002 decision of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]] which determined that the same-sex life partner of a judge was entitled to the same financial benefits available to the opposite-sex spouse of a judge. The case, which challenged the [[Judges' Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Act, 1989]], was brought by [[Kathy Satchwell]], an openly [[lesbian]] judge of the [[Transvaal Provincial Division]] (now known as the [[Gauteng Division]]) of the [[High Court of South Africa|High Court]].&lt;ref name="news24-1"&gt;{{cite news |title=ConCourt rules in favour of gays |newspaper=News24 |agency=SAPA |date=25 July 2002 |url=http://www.news24.com/xArchive/Archive/ConCourt-rules-in-favour-of-gays-20020725 |accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court ruled unanimously that the law violated the [[Section Nine of the Constitution of South Africa|equality clause]] of the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]], which forbids unfair discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The judgment therefore amended the law to extend the spousal benefits to same-sex partners who had undertaken "reciprocal duties of support". Although the holding, strictly speaking, was limited to judges and their partners, it was seen as having a wider effect, with the director of the [[Lesbian and Gay Equality Project]] describing it as "yet another step toward the formal legal recognition of same-sex relationships".&lt;ref name="news24-1" /&gt;

In 2003 it was realised that a new version of the act (the [[Judges' Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Act, 2001]]) had been passed and, due to a drafting error, still included the former discriminatory language. The Constitutional Court granted an order applying the reasoning of its earlier ruling to the new act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Court ruling sets it straight |newspaper=News24 |agency=SAPA |date=17 March 2003 |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Court-ruling-sets-it-straight-20030317 |accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1496">A '''State Counsel''' is the [[public prosecutor]] in the [[legal]] system of [[Sri Lanka]].

State Counsels represent [[Sovereign state|the state]] in criminal proceedings. They are not elected, instead are [[public servant]]s as Law Officers of the [[Attorney-General's Department (Sri Lanka)|Attorney General's Department]]. To become a State Counsel, one must be a qualified [[Attorney at law (Sri Lanka)|Attorney at law]]. Senior State Counsel are members with several years of experience in public prosecution. The [[Attorney General of Sri Lanka|Attorney General]] and his/her deputy the [[Solicitor General of Sri Lanka|Solicitor General]] are former State Counsels.

Prior to 1972 the post was known as [[Crown Counsel]] and was changed when Ceylon became a republic.   

There are similarities between the role of the State Counsel and the [[Procurator Fiscal]] in [[Scotland]], [[Crown Prosecution Service|Crown Prosecutor]] in [[England and Wales]], [[Crown Attorney]]s in [[Canada]] and [[District Attorney]]s in the [[United States]].

'''Reginald Lisowski''' (July 11, 1926 – October 22, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], better known by his [[ring name]], '''The Crusher''' (sometimes '''Crusher Lisowski''' to distinguish him from other Crushers, such as [[Jerry Blackwell|Crusher Blackwell]]). In his obituary, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described him as "a professional wrestler whose blue-collar bona fides made him beloved among working class fans for 40 years".&lt;ref name="WashingtonPostObit" /&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early life and career===
Lisowski was born on July 11, 1926 and raised in the [[Milwaukee]] suburb of [[South Milwaukee]]. Early on he was more interested in football, playing fullback for the South Milwaukee High School football team, but took up wrestling while stationed in [[Germany]] with the U.S. Army.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPostObit" /&gt; Having developed a liking for the sport, he continued training with [[Ivan Racy]] and [[Buck Tassie]] at Milwaukee's Eagle's Club when he returned, eventually wrestling [[Marcel Buchet]] in his first recorded match late in 1949.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPostObit" /&gt;

His early career included wrestling three to four nights per week at a Chicago armory, typically earning $5 a night. To support himself and to stay in shape, Lisowski worked various blue collar jobs by day, from [[meat packing]] to [[bricklayer|bricklaying]].&lt;ref name="WashingtonPostObit" /&gt; [[Fred Kohler]] was the first promoter to put him on TV, and by 1954 he had developed a barrel-chested physique that would stick with him for most of his career. Decades before [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and  [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], Lisowski perfected the gimmick of the beer drinking tough guy. To further his career he bleached his dark hair blonde and started to get over as a strongman heel, famous for his [[bolo punch]] as well as a devastating [[full nelson]]. This eventually led to him winning the Chicago-area [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Chicago version)|NWA World Tag Team Championship]] with partner [[Art Nielson]].

===Tag Team wrestling===
Lisowski continued to have tag team success throughout the remainder of the 1950s, often paired with his wrestling "brother" [[Stan Holek|Stan Lisowski]]. By 1959, he was being billed as "Crusher" Lisowski, which legend came from a promoter's off-hand comment that he "just crushes everybody." Until early 1965, Crusher was a heel (hated bad guy) in the AWA. After meeting the team of [[Larry Hennig]] &amp; [[Harley Race]] for the first time, the fans adopted Crusher and his wrestling "cousin" [[Dick the Bruiser]] as full-fledged heroes in AWA territory. His bluster was legendary, as he would threaten to maul opponents in the ring and afterward "have a party, take all the dollies down Wisconsin Avenue and go dancing." Besides his impressive physique, The Crusher's gimmick was to absorb a tremendous amount of punishment and still be able to make a comeback for the win.

Over the next 15 to 20 years Crusher and Bruiser were tag partners off and on, and a natural combination due to their common background and brawling wrestling style. If Dick the Bruiser and Crusher felt they hadn't bloodied their opponents enough during a match, they would trade punches with each other afterwards. They won the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]] 5 times, the [[WWA World Tag Team Championship|WWA Tag Team Titles]] (the WWA was Dick "Bruiser" Afflis's promotion) 6 times, and the [[NWA International Tag Team Championship|NWA International Tag Titles]] among others.

===Success as a solo wrestler===
Introduced at the beginning of wrestling matches as "The Wrestler That Made Milwaukee Famous",&lt;ref name="WashingtonPostObit" /&gt; Crusher was successful as a solo wrestler, winning the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship]] three times, the first time unifying it with the Omaha version of the [[World Heavyweight Championship (Omaha version)|World Heavyweight Championship]] on July 9, 1963, in a match where he defeated [[Verne Gagne]]. He was skillful at cutting promos, as he would brag about his "100 megaton biceps" and offer to pummel "da bum" he was facing in the ring with ease, and he often delighted in calling opponents "turkeynecks."&lt;ref name="WashingtonPostObit" /&gt; His most quotable and famous phrase though was: "How 'bout 'dat?"&lt;ref name="WashingtonPostObit" /&gt; When asked how he trained for a match, he'd claim he ran along the waterfront in Milwaukee carrying a large full beer barrel over either shoulder for strength (and longtime AWA announcer [[Rodger Kent]]  often noted that by the end of the Crusher's training run, the beer was gone), and that he'd dance [[polka]] all night with Polish barmaids to increase his stamina.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPostObit" /&gt; Although much of Crusher's popularity came from the idea that he was a big beer drinker, in actuality, he never drank beer, and according to [[Baron Von Raschke]], he actually preferred wine.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8W5-dHlZpc&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crusher's wrestling career almost ended in 1981, when the 450-pound [[Jerry Blackwell]] botched a top rope move and landed on Lisowski's right arm, causing nerve damage from his shoulder all the way to his wrist. Doctors told him he'd never wrestle again, but Crusher did strength training for two years while he was unofficially "retired," returning to the ring in 1983.

===Move to the World Wrestling Federation===
He also had a successful run in the WWWF in the early 1960s where he was a nemesis of [[Johnny Valentine]] and a very young [[Bruno Sammartino]], primarily in the Pittsburgh promotion. He drew very large crowds to Forbes Field with battles against each man.

In the mid-1980s, seeing that the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) promotion with which he had the most success over the years was crumbling, particularly when [[Hulk Hogan]] and many of the other top talent jumped ship to Vince McMahon's [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), Crusher went to work for McMahon on a part-time basis, appearing at WWF house shows all over the Midwest. Lisowski claimed that he made more money working part-time for McMahon than he did working for the frugal Gagne on a full-time basis.

In 1986, Lisowski occasionally teamed with [[The Machines (professional wrestling)|The Machines]] as Crusher Machine.

The Crusher's last match was at a WWF [[house show]] in [[Omaha]] on February 15, 1988. He replaced [[Billy Jack Haynes]] to team with [[Ken Patera]] and face [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]], who were disqualified when [[Mr. Fuji]] tripped Crusher with a cane about three minutes in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/88.htm|title=1988 WWE Results|publisher=The History of WWE|accessdate=July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crusher's last television appearance was at WWF's 1998 pay-per-view [[Over the Edge: In Your House]] where was shown sitting alongside [[Mad Dog Vachon]] in the front row. [[Jerry Lawler]] made fun of the two men's age, and tried to steal Vachon's artificial leg, but Vachon hit him over the head with it, and Crusher punched him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/98.htm|title=1998 WWE Results|publisher=The History of WWE|accessdate=July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Lawler bailed, the two former enemies shook hands.

===Legacy===
In 1964, the [[Minneapolis]]-based garage rock band The Novas wrote a song dedicated to him called "The Crusher", with lead singer Bob Nolan imitating the raunchy voice of Crusher Lisowski (and his trademark yell at the beginning of the record). The tune, which included the lyrics "Do the hammer lock, you turkeynecks!" was popular in the upper Midwest and made it to #88 on the national ''Billboard'' chart.&lt;ref name="MPR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrestler 'The Crusher' inspires hit song|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/01/29/music3|publisher=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017|date=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later covered by [[The Cramps]] on their album ''[[Psychedelic Jungle]]''. The song has received a resurgence of popularity in recent years, as [[David Letterman]] has often played it on his late-night talk show. [[The Ramones]] released a song entitled "The Crusher" paying tribute to Lisowski on their last studio recorded album, ''[[¡Adios Amigos!|Adios Amigos]]''.

==Personal life==
In 1974, he and Dick the Bruiser starred in the movie ''[[The Wrestler (1974 film)|The Wrestler]]'', where they beat up a posse of mobsters on the big screen.

In his later years, multiple surgeries on his hips and knee crippled him, as well as a non-cancerous tumor removed from his brain stem in March 2005, which left Lisowski partially paralyzed.

Lisowski's wife Faye died in March 2003 after the couple were married for 55 years.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPostObit" /&gt; Lisowski died of a brain tumor on October 22, 2005, at age 79.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPostObit" /&gt; He, his wife, Faye, and infant son Gary are interred at the Holy Sepulcher Cemetery near Milwaukee. He was survived by four children, nine grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPostObit" /&gt;

Gagne reacted to his death by saying to the ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'', "We had some dandy matches. The Crusher never was a great technically skilled wrestler, but he was tougher than nails and a brawler. He could bench press nearly 600 pounds. And he loved to have fun. After a match, he couldn't get a beer in his hands fast enough."&lt;ref name="WashingtonPostObit" /&gt;

'''Ticho House''' ({{lang-he|בית טיכו}}, ''Beit Tikho'') is a historical home in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]], now functioning as a [[museum]], administered as part of the national [[Israel Museum]], which includes a restaurant and cultural center. It was one of the first homes built outside the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City walls]] during the 1860s. {{cn|date=August 2014}}

==History==
The house was constructed by a wealthy Arab, Aga Rashid [[Nashashibi]], in 1864.{{cn|date=May 2015}} Antiquities dealer [[Moses Shapira|Moses Wilhelm Shapira]] lived in the house with his family between 1873 and 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSAO&amp;Volume=5&amp;Issue=5&amp;ArticleID=9 |title=Fakes! |author=Hershel Shanks |work=Archaeology Odyssey 5:05, Sep/Oct 2002 |publisher=Biblical Archaeology Society |year=2002 |accessdate=2014-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, Dr. Abraham Albert Ticho, an ophthalmologist, and his wife, [[Anna Ticho]], an artist, bought the house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/peeking-through-the-highrises-famed-jerusalem-street-s-old-architectural-glories.premium-1.461294 Peeking through the highrises: famed Jerusalem street's old architectural glories, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ticho was stabbed and seriously wounded during the [[1929 Palestine riots]] outside his eye clinic near [[Damascus Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/middle-east/israel/jerusalem/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654611891 Beit Ticho - Reviews and Ratings of Sights in Jerusalem - New York Times Travel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029022829/http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/middle-east/israel/jerusalem/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654611891 |date=2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his recovery, Dr. Ticho used the first floor as his new clinic, from where served the population of Jerusalem until his death in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/htmls/page_1712.aspx?c0=15183&amp;bsp=14296 Ticho House - Israel Museum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120141726/http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/htmls/page_1712.aspx?c0=15183&amp;bsp=14296 |date=2012-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Ticho hosted local and British government officials in her home, as well as many artists, writers, academics and intellectuals. 

Anna Ticho bequeathed the house and all its contents, including her husband's [[Judaica]] collections and library, to the city of Jerusalem.{{cn|date=August 2014}}

==Anna==
Ticho House operates the kosher dairy restaurant, Anna Italian Café, operating in part of the first floor and the garden.

Ct. 2362 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;, is a decision by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] holding that the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] guarantees individuals the right to bear arms. The case involved a challenge to the Constitutionality of {{usc|18|922(g)(8)(C)(ii)}}, a federal statute which prohibited the transportation of firearms or ammunition in interstate commerce by persons subject to a court order that, by its explicit terms, prohibits the use of physical force against an intimate partner or child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawschool.courtroomview.com/acf_cases/9528-united-states-v-emerson |title=''United States v.

The Fifth Circuit engaged in an extensive analysis of the text and history of the Second Amendment and its attendant caselaw (including many state supreme court decisions), and it ultimately determined that the Second Amendment "protects the right of individuals to privately" [[right to keep and bear arms|keep and bear arms]]. Nonetheless, the court held that the particular deprivation of the right to bear arms in the case before it did not violate the Constitution, while also acknowledging the federal government's sharp limitations on disarming of individual Americans. The U.S. Supreme Court denied [[certiorari|review]] of the Fifth Circuit's decision.&lt;ref name="Cert"/&gt;

The ''''' Vitae duorum Offarum''''' "The lives of the two Offas" is a literary history written in the mid-thirteenth century, apparently by the [[St Albans]] monk [[Matthew Paris]].;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vaugh, ''Matthew Paris'' (Cambridge, 1958), pp. 42-8&lt;/ref&gt; however, the most recent editor and translator of the work rejects this attribution and argues for an earlier date, in the late twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;M. Swanton, ''The Lives of Two Offas'' (Crediton, 2006), pp. xxx-xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest editor, William Wats, argues that the texts are older than Matthew's day but were revised by him; he bases this view on stylistic elements, such as the inclusion in the first ''Vita'' of a quotation from [[Lucan]] (''Pharsalia'' I. 92–3) which also appears repeatedly in Matthew's ''[[Chronica maiora]]''.

==Account==
The text concerns two kings, [[Offa of Angel|King Offa of the Angles]], a fourth or fifth-century ancestor figure of the Mercians, and King [[Offa of Mercia]] (r. 757-796), through whose lives the text recounts the foundation of St Albans Abbey: Offa of Angel made the vow to found a monastery, while several centuries later, his namesake Offa of Mercia executed this plan on discovering the relics of the British martyr king [[St Alban]] and built St Albans Abbey. Although some historical elements are interwoven into the story, Matthew had little reliable information to go on and much of the narrative is therefore fictitious.

Of particular interest is that it features the oldest surviving account of the "Constance" tale-type.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Schlauch]], ''Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens'', New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 64&lt;/ref&gt;  The king of York tries to marry his daughter; when she refuses, she is abandoned in the woods, where Offa finds her, and he marries her, but later, when he is at war, through a forged letter, she is again abandoned in the woods with her children, and she, Offa, and the children are reunited many years later.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'' pp 23-4 New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt;  This tale was particular popular in [[chivalric romance]] such as ''[[The Man of Law's Tale]]'' and ''[[Emaré]]'' in England.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'' p24-5 New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt;  Twenty variants are known, including those in French, Latin, German, and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Schlauch, ''Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens'', New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 69&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that it is related to the story of Offa and his queen in ''[[Beowulf]]'', but ''Beowulf'' does not contain sufficient information concerning her to identify her with this tale type; Drida is described as coming to him over water because of her father, but that could mean that she was sent by him, not that she fled him.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Schlauch, ''Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens'', New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The story contains many [[fairy tale]]s motifs:  the heroine forced to flee an incestuous marriage,&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Schlauch, ''Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens'', New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 36&lt;/ref&gt;  such as ''[[The She-Bear]]'', ''[[Allerleirauh]]'', ''[[Donkeyskin]]'', and ''[[The King who Wished to Marry His Daughter]]''; a strange woman found by the king, who marries her, but who is then forced into exile with her children owing to substituted letters,&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Schlauch, ''Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens'', New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 26&lt;/ref&gt;  such as ''[[The Girl Without Hands]]'' and ''[[The Armless Maiden]]''; or a fairy tale featuring both elements, as in ''[[Penta of the Chopped-off Hands]]''.

==Manuscripts==
[[Image:Matthew Paris Offa horseback.jpg|250px|thumb|Depiction of Offa from Matthew Paris's tract on St. Alban]]
The text is preserved in two manuscripts: 
*The ''Liber additamentorum'', [[British Library|BL]] [[Cotton library|Cotton]] MS [[List of manuscripts in the Cotton library#Nero|Nero]] D I, where it is accompanied by miniatures made both by Matthew Paris and by a fourteenth-century hand, and
*MS Add. 62777 ([[British Library|BL]], London), a copy of the former.

Previously, Matthew Paris had written another, brief account of Offa of Mercia in his Latin copy of ''Vie de Saint Auban'' "The Life of St Alban" (verse), preserved in Trinity College Dublin, MS 177, which is also embellished with miniatures portraying selected episodes.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Paris, ''La Vie de seint Auban'', ed.

'''Vyborg Castle''' ({{lang-ru|Выборгский замок}}, {{lang-fi|Viipurin linna}}, {{lang-sv|Viborgs fästning}}) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]]-built [[medieval]] [[fortress]] around which the town of [[Vyborg]] (today in [[Russia]]) evolved. The first record of the castle dates back to 1293. Currently it serves as a [[museum]].

==General==
Vyborg Castle was one of the three major castles of [[Finland]]. It was built as the easternmost outpost of the medieval [[History of Sweden (800–1521)|Kingdom of Sweden]]: it is located on the [[Karelian Isthmus]], on a little islet in the innermost corner of the [[Gulf of Finland]], in a tight strait which connects [[Suomenvedenpohja]] to the [[Bay of Viipuri]]. It was originally constructed in the 1290s on the site of [[Karelia (historical province of Finland)|Karelian]] fortress after the [[Third Swedish Crusade]] to Finland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The town was originally located inside the outer fortifications of the castle, at the fortress island, but it had to be moved to its present location off of the island because of lack of space.

== Iron Age History ==
[[V. A. Tjulanev]]s excavations in 1980`s indicated that a [[Karelia (historical province of Finland)|Karelian]] fortress pre-dated the castle built by the Swedes in 1293. The oldest layers of occupation have been discovered in the so-called Smith`s Courtyard. A man-made breastwork of sand with timber posts was found from this area. Also charred remains of buildings, which some were linked to the breastwork, were also found. Tjulenev suggests that the Karelian fort had a wooden tower. Tjulanev's several finds from the area include a bent sword which was dated to the period between 1130-1200.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Hillforts of Finland|last=Taavitsainen|first=Jussi-Pekka|publisher=Suomen muinaismuistoyhdistyksen aikakausikirja 94|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=240|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval history==

Construction of the next phase of the fortress started in 1293 by orders of [[Torkel Knutsson]], [[Lord High Constable of Sweden]], who in the 1290s made a supposed [[crusade]] against [[Karelia]], the [[Third Swedish Crusade]]. The crusade was part of the ongoing [[Swedish–Novgorodian Wars]], against the Russians of the [[Novgorod Republic]]. Knutsson chose the location of the new fortress to control the [[Bay of Vyborg]], which was bordered by trading sites long used by the local population. From the bay, a navigable river passage goes inland, ultimately connecting the place with several districts, lakes, and, indirectly by [[portage]], with rivers flowing into [[Lake Ladoga]].

The three high-medieval Finnish "castle fiefs" were ruled until the 1360s from the castles of [[Turku]] (formerly {{lang|sv|Åbo}} in Swedish), [[Hämeenlinna]] ({{lang|sv|Tavastehus}}), and Vyborg ({{lang|sv|Viborg}}).

In 1364, [[Albert III of Mecklenburg]] was proclaimed [[king of Sweden]], and in accordance with the German model he began to divide the castle fiefs, which were immense in Finland, into smaller provinces.  In some instances, these new, smaller provinces were given separate [[bailiff]]s' residences which have since disappeared; this was the case with the [[Linnavuori]] castle mound in [[Porvoo]] ({{lang|sv|Borgå}}) and the castle of [[Korsholm Castle|Korsholm]] in [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]], near the modern-day city of [[Vaasa]] which was founded later. Only earthworks remain at these sites, but in two places, still-extant though now ruined stone strongholds were built: [[Raseborg Castle]], in western [[Uusimaa]] (west of [[Helsinki]]), and [[Kastelholm Castle]], in the [[Åland Islands]].

The castle became the stronghold of the Swedish realm in the Karelian region. Throughout the centuries, it was the first defence of the kingdom against Russians. Its military and strategic status in the late Middle Ages was second only to the fortified capital [[Stockholm]].

The castle and the large surrounding fief became a virtually [[autonomous]] [[principality]]. Its governors were usually enfeoffed with the incomes of the county. The [[fief of Viborg]] became known as a [[margraviate]]. Its governors were generally from the most powerful families of the kingdom. They enjoyed large administrative powers at a significant distance from the capital. These realities made them practically independent rulers. The castle of [[Savonlinna]], [[Olavinlinna]] (built in the 1470s), was usually subjugated to Viborg.

Prominent men who held Viborg as their fief included [[Bo Jonsson (Grip)]], [[Christer Nilsson Vasa]] (1417–42), [[Karl Knutsson Bonde]] (1442–48, the future king), [[Erik Axelsson Tott (regent of Sweden)|Eric Axelsson Tott]] (1457–81), [[Knut Posse]] (1495–97), [[Sten Sture the Elder]] (1497–99, between his regencies), [[Eric Bielke]], and Count [[John of Hoya]]. Particularly in the 1440s and the late 15th century, the fortresses were further enlarged.

The first mention of firearms in Finland relates to Viborg castle in 1429. During the Middle Ages the Russians repeatedly besieged the castle, most famously in 1495 during the [[Russo-Swedish War (1495–97)]] while Knut Posse was governor of the castle.  The situation of the defenders looked hopeless, but they were saved by the [[Viborg blast]] on 30 November 1495 ([[St. Andrew's Day]]), a mysterious explosion which scared the Russians away after they believed they had seen a Saint Andrew's cross in the sky.

==Modern history==
[[File:Vyborg Castle, Viipuri 1918.webm|thumb|Vyborg Castle in 1918]]
In the 16th century, much was renovated and additions were made. In the 17th century, the castle was allowed to decay, as Russian danger was lessened and the border was further eastwards.

Viborg was taken by the Russians in 1710, but passed back to Finnish hands in 1812 when all of [[Old Finland]] was attached to the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. The castle owes its present appearance to extensive restorations undertaken in the 1890s. The military of the [[Russian Empire]] used the castle until 1918 &lt;!-- 1917 or 1918? --&gt; for housing administration.

{{lang|fi|Viipuri}} belonged to the newly independent Republic of Finland between 1917–40 and again 1941–44. As a result of [[Karelian question in Finnish politics|border changes]] in [[World War II]] it was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1944.

==Architecture==
The main castle, located in the eastern part of the islet on its highest hill, has an irregular four-cornered layout, with the immense [[tower of St. Olav]] (Pyhän Olavin torni in Finnish) as its biggest section. It is 3–4 stories tall, varying in places. Outer defensive works surround the main castle, following the islet's coastlines.

The '''''Wenyuan Yinghua''''' ({{zh|c=文苑英華|p=Wényuàn Yīnghuá}}), sometimes translated as  ''Finest Blossoms in the Garden of Literature'', is an anthology of poetry, odes, songs and writings from the [[Liang dynasty]] to the [[Five Dynasties]] era. The book was compiled by a team of officers headed by [[Li Fang (Song dynasty)|Li Fang]] under an imperial order from 982 to 986, during the [[Song dynasty]]. It is divided into 1,000 volumes and 38 [[genus]] by sections with 19,102 pieces of works written by about 2,200 authors, much of the crucial compilation of the writings came from the [[Tang dynasty]] scholars. It is considered one of the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]''.

The object also received the names ''zingpogandeme'' (seat of the king) and ''zinkpojandeme'' (seat with braided decoration). It is estimated to have been produced at the turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It was exposed in a central showcase in the [[Kumbukumbu Room]], of which was the main highlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citar periódico|data=2018-06-27|titulo=Trono africano do Século XVIII é uma das primeiras peças do Museu Nacional|url=https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/trono-africano-do-seculo-xviii-uma-das-primeiras-pecas-do-museu-nacional-22825442|jornal=O Globo}}{{pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
