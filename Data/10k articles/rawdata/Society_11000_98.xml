'''Afro-Bolivians''' are Bolivian people of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n heritage and therefore the descriptive "Afro-Bolivian" may refer to historical or cultural elements in [[Bolivia]] thought to emanate from their community. It can also refer to the combining of African and other cultural elements found in Bolivian society such as [[religion]], [[music]], [[language]], the [[arts]], and [[social class|class]] culture. The Afro-Bolivians are recognized as one of the constituent ethnic groups of Bolivia by the country's government, and are ceremonially led by a king who traces his descent back to a line of monarchs that reigned in Africa during the medieval period.

==History of slavery in Bolivia==

In 1544, the Spanish [[Conquistadors]] discovered the silver mines in a city now called [[Potosí]], which is on the base of [[Cerro Rico]] (Rich Mountain) in Bolivia. Almost immediately, they began enslaving the natives as workers in the mines. However, the health of the natives working in the mines became very poor, which is why the Spanish began to look towards a new group for labor. By the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Spanish mine owners and barons began bringing in African slaves in high numbers to help work the mines with the natives who were still able.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minorityrights.org/2406/bolivia/afrobolivians.html Afro-Bolivians] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110731035319/http://www.minorityrights.org/2406/bolivia/afrobolivians.html |date=July 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Slaves were put to work in difficult conditions. Some slaves working in the mines survived no more than a few months. Initially, the slaves were not used to working at such a high altitude. Many of these Native and African workers' lives were cut short because of the toxic smelter fumes and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] vapors they inhaled while working the mines. Slaves worked in the mines for 4 months on average. As such they had to be blindfolded upon leaving the mines to protect their eyes, which had become adapted to darkness.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Although it was a requirement for Natives and Africans over 18 years of age to work in the mines for 12-hour shifts, younger children were still reputed to be put to work in the mines. These children worked fewer hours; however, they were still exposed to the same extremely harsh conditions of all the miners, including [[asbestos]], toxic gases, cave-ins, and explosions. It is estimated that as many as eight million Africans and Natives died from working the mines between 1545, when the Spaniards first put the Natives to work, until 1825, the end of the colonial period.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The Spaniards' way of fortifying the slaves against the harsh conditions in the mines was to provide them with coca leaves to chew. [[Coca]], a very important element of Bolivian culture, is an agricultural product  consumed in Bolivia that can also be processed into [[cocaine]]. By chewing coca leaves, the slaves numbed their senses to the cold, as well as dampening the feeling of hunger and alleviating [[altitude sickness]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==The Yungas==
After their emancipation in the 19th century, Afro-Bolivians would relocate to a place called the [[Yungas]]. The Yungas, which is not far north from the city of [[La Paz]], is where most of the country’s coca is grown. In parts of the Yungas such as [[Coroico]], [[Mururata]], [[Chicaloma]], [[Calacala]]-[[Coscoma]], and [[Irupana]] are a large number of Bolivians of African heritage. Before the Bolivians relocated to the Yungas, it was a place mostly inhabited by indigenous [[Aymara people]] and [[mestizos]] (European and Native mixed people). It is believed that the Natives thought that darker skin was more attractive, which is why they were impressed with the skin of the Africans when they first began arriving to Bolivia. For this reason, it is no surprise that many of the Afro-Bolivians would intermarry with the Aymara, adopt many of their cultural elements such as their style of dressing, and even become an [[Aymaran]] speaking subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bolivia-travels.com/yungas/ |title=Terra Andina Bolivia, tourism and adventure In Bolivia |access-date=2011-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313044908/http://bolivia-travels.com/yungas/ |archive-date=2012-03-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some black Indians with drums of African origin==
Although these Afro-Bolivians were free, they still had a difficult battle in trying to maintain their culture. Many elements of their culture began to disappear, such as their feast, language, and spiritual sense to name a few. They had to fight very strongly against the colonial aggression and exclusion of their post-emancipation culture. One of the ways that they were able to hold on to this culture was through their music and dance. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Saya music== 
The biggest African influence in Bolivian culture is [[Afro-Bolivian Saya|Saya music]] or La Saya. Saya, which is growing in popularity in Bolivia, is still very misunderstood. The reason for this lack of understanding of saya is because the interpretation of the instruments as well as the rhythm is very peculiar. It involves Andean instruments incorporated with African percussion. The primary instrument is the drum, which was passed on by their African ancestors, along with gourds, shakers, and even jingles bells that are attached to their clothing on the ankle area.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

During the performance of saya, the Afro-Bolivians wear Aymara style clothing. The women wear a bright multi-colored blouse with ribbons, a multi-colored skirt called a “pollera”, with a “manta” (back cover) in their hand, and a bowler hat. The men on the other hand, wear a hat, feast shirt, an Aymara style sash around the waist, woolen thick cloth pants called “bayeta pants”, and sandals.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Every rhythm of Saya begins with the beating of a jingle bell by the Caporal (foreman) who guides the dance. This Caporal (also called capataz) guides the dancers with a cudgel (whip) in hand, decorated pants, and jingle bells near the ankles. The women, who have their own guide during this dance, sing while moving their hips, shaking their hands, as well as dialoguing with the men who play the bass drum and coancha.

==Afro-Bolivians today==
[[File:AfrobolivanQueen.jpg|thumb|Angélica Larrea, wife of [[Julio Pinedo|King Julio Pinedo]], and [[Afro-Bolivian monarchy|Queen of the Afro-bolivian community]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.casarealafroboliviana.org/fundamentos-juridicos.html&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012]]
Even though Bolivia had the richest silver mine in the world in the 17th century, it is currently the 2nd poorest country in South America. Most Bolivians live in rural areas, are unable to acquire basic needs, and depend on farming for their survival. In fact, it was reported at Bolivia’s national referendum in 2004, that Afro-Bolivians (as well as the indigenous people) face discrimination, disadvantages in health, life expectancy, education, income, literacy, and work under brutal conditions. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

It has been estimated that 25,000 Afro-Bolivians live in the Yungas. They are proud of their culture and have fought very hard to preserve it. In fact, in the town of Mururata, the Afro-Bolivians managed to maintain their traditional culture, to the point of maintaining a continuous [[Afro-Bolivian monarchy]] currently led by [[Julio Pinedo]]. Afro-Bolivians spread to the east in [[Cochabamba]] and [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]]. In Santa Cruz there are  more Afro-Brazilians than Afro-Bolivians. They are trying to put together African culture classes for the young people, in an attempt to maintain their African culture. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Despite the Afro-Bolivian community fervently working to preserve their culture, many Afro-Bolivians have reported experiencing severe racism and feelings of isolation from society due to intolerance. Laws that actually criminalize racism and discrimination in Afro-Bolivia have slowly been ratified as the first anti-discriminatory law (law 45) was passed in 2010 and was met with violent protesting and rioting. In 2009 President Evo Morales added amendments to the national constitution that outlined the rights of Afro-Bolivians and guaranteed the protection of such liberties. The amendments also generally extended to indigenous peoples and officially recognized Afro-Bolivians as a minority group in Bolivia despite them not being included in the national census three years later. In addition to the country's constitution being updated in 2009, President Morales created the Vice Ministry for Decolonization to create policies that criminalize racism while working to improve literacy and create better race relations in Bolivia.The Vice Ministry for Decolonization also works to dismantle colorism and racism influenced by European colonization while also promoting the philosophy of "intercultural-ity" in which citizens of the nation recognize every ethnic groups' traditions and cultural practices as contributions to society.

{{Anarchism sidebar|Issues}}
{{Islam}}
'''Islamic anarchism''' is based on an interpretation of [[Islam]] as "submission to God" which either prohibits or is highly critical of the role of human authority.

==Historical anarchist tendencies in Islam==
Throughout Islamic history there have been Muslim groups, movements, and individuals which could be described as anti-authoritarian, anti-capitalist, egalitarian, or opposed to the rule of specific governments. Among these, only a few are properly associated with the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] label.

===Kharijites===
An early example of anti-authoritarianism in Islam is the movement of the [[Khawarij]], which dates back to the time of the split between [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shi'i Islam]]. The Shia claimed [[Ali]] and his descendants (the [[Ahl al-Bayt]]) were the rightful successors of [[Muhammad]]. The Sunnis believed (at least initially) that the leader of all the Muslims had to be from the [[Quraysh]] tribe but could be chosen by the Muslim community. Sunnis also tended to be conservative; as long as certain minimal functions were being carried out, it was wrong to rebel against the lawful Muslim ruler, even when they were being sinful.

The Khawarij initially supported the leadership of Ali, but turned against him when they disagreed with some of his decisions. They claimed that any qualified Muslim could be the [[Imam]], the community's spiritual and religious leader. They were also more willing to rebel against Muslim rulers.

At least one sect of Kharajites, the [[Najdiyya]], believed that if no suitable [[imam]] was present in the community, then the position could be dispensed with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crone|first1=Patricia|authorlink1=Patricia Crone|title=A Statement by the Najdiyya Khārijites on the Dispensability of the Imamate|journal=Studia Islamica|date=1 January 1998|issue=88|pages=55–76|doi=10.2307/1595697|jstor=1595697}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nukkari]], a subsect of the [[Ibadiyya]], reportedly adopted a similar belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adam Gaiser |title=Muslims, Scholars, Soldiers: The Origin and Elaboration of the Ibadi Imamate Traditions |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-19-973893-9 |url={{Google books|D22jKeEgC-kC|p=175|plainurl=y}} |page=175 note 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muʿtazili===
A strand of [[Muʿtazila|Muʿtazili]] thought paralleled that of the Najdiyya: if rulers inevitably became tyrants, then the only acceptable course of action was to depose them.&lt;ref name="Koch2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Bettina|title=Patterns Legitimizing Political Violence in Transcultural Perspectives: Islamic and Christian Traditions and Legacies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jJilCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103|year=2015|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-1-61451-394-0|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sheikh Bedreddin===
[[Sheikh Bedreddin]] (1359–1420) ({{lang-ota|شیخ بدرالدین}}) was a [[Socialism|proto-Socialist]] revolutionary [[Sufism|Sufi]] theologian and charismatic preacher who led a rebellion against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1416. His full name was Şeyh Bedrettin Mahmud Bin İsrail Bin Abdülaziz.

His writings were condemned by a number of Ottoman religious scholars such as [[İsmail Hakkı Bursevi]]. Others instead praise him. He is a popular figure among Turkey's [[left-wing politics|left]]. [[Nâzım Hikmet]] was jailed for inciting rebellion after encouraging military cadets to read Bedreddin's work. The musicians [[Cem Karaca]] and [[O. Z. Livaneli]] composed a song based on  Hikmet's epic poem, the ''Şeyh Bedrettin Destanı''. In Hikmet's work, Bedreddin and his companions emphasize that all things must be shared "except the lips of the beloved."

Sheikh Bedrettin's proto-socialist ideas emphasised direct action, direct democracy, international and interfaith human solidarity, equality and communal life. He is highly respected among the Turkish anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchistnews.org/?q%3Dnode%2F5141 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620233552/http://anarchistnews.org/?q=node%2F5141 |archivedate=2010-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ali Shariati===
{{main article|Ali Shariati}}
An important and influential figure in the 20th century was [[Ali Shariati]], who was considered the principal theoretician and leader&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand. 1993. ‘Ali Shariati: ideologue of the Iranian revolution’. In Edmund Burke and Ira Lapidus (eds.), ''Islam, politics, and social movements''. Los Angeles: University of California Press. First published in MERIP Reports (January 1982): 25-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gheissari, Ali. 1998. ''Iranian Intellectuals in the Twentieth Century''. Austin: University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  of the popular movement that ultimately culminated in the mass uprisings that led to the [[Iranian Revolution]] and the overthrow and dissolution of the [[History of Iran#Pahlavi era (1925–1979)|Pahlavi Iran]] on 11 February 1979.

From the 1950s and on, Shariati was continually persecuted and often imprisoned in solitary confinement by the Imperial authorities with the support of the mainline Shi'a clergy who feared that Shariati was poised to become a national leader in the same vein as [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]]. Shariati's [[anti-clericalism|anticlerical]] and [[populism|populist]] interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;  of [[Twelver]] Shi'i Islam was strongly influenced by the nationalist [[republic]]an historian and philosopher, [[Ahmad Kasravi]], who had advocated a [[secularism|secular]] [[reformism|reformist]] interpretation of Islam, intertwined with a detailed study of the history of the [[Iranian peoples]].

However, while Kasravi was a [[conservatism|conservative]] nationalist, Shariati was on the opposite end of the spectrum, embracing both the [[far-left politics|far left]] and radical traditionalists. Shariati was one of the very few national figures who was popular and respected across the diverse ethnolinguistic spectrum of Iran, as loved by the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Kurds]] and [[Baloch people]] as he was by the Shia.&lt;ref name=ostovar&gt;{{cite web|last=Ostovar|first=Afshon P.|title=Guardians of the Islamic Revolution  Ideology, Politics, and the Development of Military Power in Iran  (1979–2009)|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/64683/afshon_1.pdf;jsessionid=DF7BFA33BF18FF73E9117CB0504F14E1?sequence=1|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=26 July 2013|format=PhD Thesis|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continuous persecution of Shariati by both the Imperial State and the followers of [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] began to take its toll on his health. After his last incarceration, having spent eighteen months in solitary, Shariati spent the next three years under close surveillance and his [[freedom of movement]] highly restricted under virtual [[house arrest]]. On 20 March 1975, under the stipulation that he remain in exile permanently, Shariati was granted permission to leave Iran for the [[United Kingdom]]. Three weeks after his arrival in [[London]], Shariati suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and shortly thereafter died.

Although Shariati was not an anarchist, his vision of Islam&lt;ref&gt;Shariati, Ali, "A Manifestation of Self-Reconstruction and Reformation", (1975), p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; was highly influenced by the [[Third-Worldism]] that he encountered as a student in Paris — ideas that [[class conflict|class war]] and revolution would bring about a just and classless society — from one side, and the [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] movements of his time from the other side. He is said to have adopted the idea of ''[[Gharbzadegi]]'' from [[Jalal Al-e-Ahmad]] and given it "its most vibrant and influential second life." &lt;ref&gt;Mottahedeh, Roy, ''The Mantle of the Prophet : Religion and Politics in Iran'', p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; was that of a religion based upon the values of [[social justice]], [[women's rights]], [[minority rights]], [[land reform]] for farmers and agrarians, advocacy for the [[poverty|poor and indigent]], as well as a [[direct democracy]] that would allow for [[self-governance]] instead of having to rely on career politicians and elected representatives. He believed that the only true reflection of the Islamic concept of [[Tawhid]] (unity and oneness of God) is a [[classless society]].

In [[Aztec mythology]], the '''Creator-Gods''' are the only four sons of the creator couple [[Ometecuhtli]] and [[Omecihuatl]] "Lord and Lady of Duality", "Lord and Lady of the Near and the Close", "Father and Mother of the Gods", "Father and Mother of us all", who received the gift of the creation to create other living beings without childbearing, they are residing atop a mythical thirteenth heaven Ilhuicatl-[[Omeyocan]] "the place of duality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=El Mundo Mágico de los Dioses del Anáhuac|editor=Editorial Universo México|authorlink=Otilia Meza|language=Spanish|year=1981|location=México|pages=13|isbn=968-35-0093-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the four sons takes a turn as Sun, these suns are the [[Five Suns|sun of earth]], the [[Five Suns|sun of air]], the [[Five Suns|sun of fire]], the [[Five Suns|sun of water]] ([[Tlaloc]], rain god replaces [[Xipe-Totec]]). Each world is destroyed. The present era, [[Five Suns|the Fifth Sun]] is ushered in when a lowly god, [[Nanahuatzin]] sacrifices himself in fire and becomes [[Tonatiuh]], the Fifth Sun. In his new position of power he refuses to go into motion until the gods make sacrifice to him. In an elaborate ceremony, [[Quetzalcoatl]] cuts the hearts out of each of the gods and offers it to [[Tonatiuh]] (and the moon [[Meztli]]). All of this occurs in the ancient and sacred, pre-Aztec city of [[Teotihuacan]]. It is predicted that eventually, like the previous epochs, this one will come to a cataclysmic end.

#Also recognized as [[Camaxtle]].
#[[Quetzalcoatl]] was also related to gods of the wind, of [[Venus]], of the dawn, of merchants and of arts, crafts and knowledge. He was also the patron god of the Aztec priesthood, of learning and knowledge, patron of priests, the inventor of the calendar and of books, and the protector of goldsmiths and other craftsmen. As the morning and evening star, Quetzalcoatl was the symbol of death and resurrection. A feathered serpent deity has been worshipped by many different ethno-political groups in [[Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican history]].
#[[Huitzilopochtli]] was also a tribal god and a legendary wizard of the Aztecs. Originally he was of little importance to the Nahuas, but after the rise of the Aztecs, the [[Nahuals]] reformed their religion and put [[Huitzilopochtli]] at the same level as [[Quetzalcoatl]] and [[Tezcatlipoca]], making him a solar god. Huitzilopochtli is presented as the deity who guided the long migration the Aztecs undertook from [[Aztlan]], their traditional home, to the [[Valley of Mexico]].

=== Tezcatlipoca ===
[[File:Codex Borgia page 17.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tezcatlipoca]] (bottom), god of providence in the [[Codex Borgia]].]]
Tezcatlipoca was generally represented with a stripe of black paint across his face and an obsidian mirror in place of one of his feet. The post-Classic (after ad 900) Maya-Quiche people of [[Guatemala]] revered him as a lightning god under the name [[Hurakan]] ("One Foot"). Other representations show [[Tezcatlipoca]] with his mirror on his chest. In it he saw everything; invisible and omnipresent, he knew all the deeds and thoughts of humans.

By Aztec times (14th–16th century ad), Tezcatlipoca's manifold attributes and functions had brought him to the summit of the divine hierarchy, where he ruled together with [[Huitzilopochtli]], [[Tlaloc]], and [[Quetzalcoatl]]. Called [[Yoalli Ehecatl]] ("Night Wind"), [[Yaotl]] ("Warrior"), and [[Telpochtli]] ("Young Man"), he was said to appear at crossroads at night to challenge warriors. He presided over the telpochcalli ("young men's houses"), district schools in which the sons of the common people received an elementary education and military training. He was the protector of slaves and severely punished masters who ill-treated "Tezcatlipoca's beloved children". He rewarded virtue by bestowing riches and fame, and he chastised wrongdoers by sending them sickness (as [[leprosy]]) or by reducing them to poverty and slavery. The main rite of Tezcatlipoca's cult took place during [[Toxcatl]], the fifth ritual month. Every year at that time the priest selected a young and handsome war prisoner. For one year he lived in princely luxury, impersonating the god. Four beautiful girls dressed as goddesses were chosen as his companions. On the appointed feast day, he climbed the steps of a small temple while breaking flutes that he had played. At the top he was sacrificed by the removal of his heart.

=== Xipe-Totec ===
[[File:Codex Borgia page 61.jpg|thumb|[[Tonacatecuhtli]] (adove-left), [[Xipe-Totec]] (adove-right) and [[Xiuhtecuhtli]] (below) in the [[Codex Borgia]].]]
Representations of [[Xipe-Totec]] first appeared at [[Xollalpan]], near [[Teotihuacan]], and at [[Texcoco, State of Mexico|Texcoco]], in connection with the Mazapan culture—that is, during the post-Classic Toltec phase (9th–12th century ad). The Aztecs adopted his cult during the reign of Axayacatl (1469–81). During [[Tlacaxipehualiztli]] ("Flaying of Men"), the second ritual month of the Aztec year, the priests killed human victims by removing their hearts. They flayed the bodies and put on the skins, which were dyed yellow and called teocuitlaquemitl ("golden clothes"). Other victims were fastened to a frame and put to death with arrows; their blood dripping down was believed to symbolize the fertile spring rains. A hymn sung in honour of Xipe-Totec called him [[Yoalli Tlauana]] ("Night Drinker") because beneficent rains fell during the night; it thanked him for bringing the [[Feathered Serpent]], who was the symbol of plenty, and for averting drought.

=== Quetzalcoatl ===
One important body of myths describes [[Quetzalcoatl]] as the priest-king of [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], the capital of the Toltecs. He never offered human victims, only snakes, birds, and butterflies. But the god of the night sky, Tezcatlipoca, expelled him from [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]] by performing feats of black magic. Quetzalcoatl wandered down to the coast of the "divine water" (the Atlantic Ocean) and then immolated himself on a pyre, emerging as the planet Venus. According to another version, he embarked upon a raft made of snakes and disappeared beyond the eastern horizon. The legend of the victory of Tezcatlipoca over the [[Feathered Serpent]] probably reflects historical fact. The first century of the Toltec civilization was dominated by the [[Teotihuacan]] culture, with its inspired ideals of priestly rule and peaceful behaviour. The pressure of the northern immigrants brought about a social and religious revolution, with a military ruling class seizing power from the priests. Quetzalcoatl's defeat symbolized the downfall of the Classic theocracy. His sea voyage to the east should probably be connected with the invasion of [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] by the Itza, a tribe that showed strong [[Toltec]] features. Quetzalcoatl's calendar name was [[Ce Acatl]] (One Reed). As the god of learning, of writing, and of books, Quetzalcoatl was particularly venerated in the calmecac, religious colleges annexed to the temples, in which the future priests and the sons of the nobility were educated. Outside of Tenochtitlan, the main centre of Quetzalcoatl's cult was [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], on the [[Puebla]] plateau.

=== Huitzilopochtli ===
Representations of [[Huitzilopochtli]] usually show him as a hummingbird or as a warrior with armour and helmet made of hummingbird feathers. In a pattern similar to that found in many hummingbirds, his legs, arms, and the lower part of his face were painted one color (blue) and the upper half of his face was another (black). He wore an elaborate feathered headdress and brandished a round shield and a turquoise snake. Huitzilopochtli is presented as the deity who guided the long migration the Aztecs undertook from [[Aztlan]], their traditional home, to the [[Valley of Mexico]]. During the journey his image, in the form of a hummingbird, was carried upon the shoulders of priests, and at night his voice was heard giving orders. The Aztecs believed that the sun god needed daily nourishment ([[tlaxcaltiliztli]]) in the form of human blood and hearts and that they, as people of the sun, were required to provide Huitzilopochtli with his sustenance.

The legend of Huitzilopochtli is recorded in the [[Cronica Mexicayotl|Mexicayotl Chronicle]]. His sister, [[Coyolxauhqui]], tried to kill their mother because she became pregnant in a shameful way (by a ball of [[feather]]s). Her offspring, Huitzilopochtli, learned of this plan while still in the womb, and before it was put into action, sprang from his mother's womb fully grown and fully armed.  He then killed his sister Coyolxauhqui and many of his 400 brothers. He tossed his sister's head into the sky, where it became the moon, so that his mother would be comforted in seeing her daughter in the sky every night. He threw his other brothers and sisters into the sky, where they became the stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allabouthistory.org/huitzilopochtli-faq.htm Huitzilopochtli&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508075100/http://www.allabouthistory.org/huitzilopochtli-faq.htm |date=May 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the reconsecration of Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in 1487, dedicated to [[Tlaloc]] and Huitzilopochtli, the Aztecs reported that they sacrificed about 20,400 prisoners over the course of four days. While accepted by some scholars, this claim also has been considered Aztec propaganda.  There were 19 altars in the city of [[Tenochtitlan]].

'''Bibliodiversity''' is the [[cultural diversity]] applied to the writing and publishing world. Probably born in Latin America, the concept spread broadly in the Spanish and French world during the 1990s. Now used frequently by independent publishers, authors and NGOs defending and promoting the [[cultural diversity]], “Bibliodiversity” is also an academic journal. The day of 21 September was declared by independent publishers “the Bibliodiversity Day”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Turchetto| first = Matteo| last2 =  Viklund | first2 = Andreas| title = Join the B Day| url = http://ebooks.riderdownload.com/join-the-b-day/| accessdate = 26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The concept – origin and dissemination ==

Exactly who first coined the term ''[[:es:Bibliodiversidad|bibliodiversidad]]'' remains unclear. Yet it seems beyond doubt that the word was used in Spanish first of all. Authorship has been claimed by a group of [[Chile]]an publishers who say they used it when founding the Editores independientes de [[Chile]] collective in the late 1990s. Publisher RIL Editores (www.rileditores.com) supposedly played a key role in coining the term. This claim to [[authorship|paternity]] has sometimes been disputed by Spanish publishers, however – in particular by some members of the [[Madrid]] group “Bibliodiversidad”, who claim the term as their own creation. To date neither of these two hypotheses has been supported by any printed documentation clearly authenticated by publication date.

In 1999, the directors of [http://base.d-p-h.info/fr/fiches/premierdph/fiche-premierdph-5328.html “Bibliothèque Interculturelle pour le Futur”] (‘intercultural library for the future’) – a programme established by the [http://www.fph.ch/ Charles Léopold Mayer Foundation]. and led by Michel Sauquet and Étienne Galliand – co-organised a meeting at [[Gijón]] in Spain. This is when they encountered the term, in Spanish, for the first time.

May 2002 saw the creation of the [http://www.alliance-editeurs.org/?lang=en International Alliance of Independent Publishers],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Presentation of the International Alliance of Independent Publishers| url=http://www.alliance-editeurs.org/-the-alliance-| accessdate =  25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the word was used by the organisation’s founders.

From this point onwards the [http://www.alliance-editeurs.org/?lang=en International Alliance of Independent Publishers] has made a major contribution to disseminating and promoting this term in various [[languages]], especially at its international meetings (sources available for consultation: the Declarations from [[Dakar]] in 2003, [[Guadalajara]] in 2005 and Paris in 2007) and in all its communications. The publishers’ alliance has helped the term become internationally accepted and to spread rapidly within the French-speaking world. The term ''bibliodiversity'' spreads in the English-speaking world.

== Definition ==

Echoing the concept of [[biodiversity]], “bibliodiversity” refers to the need for a variety of [[publications]] to be available to readers within a given environment. Françoise Benhamou, a French specialist of [[economics of the arts and literature]], gave this explanation in her speech at the Assises Internationales de l'Édition Indépendante (International Assembly on Independent Publishing): “In biodiversity, variety refers very simply to the number of [[species]]; in the book world, this would be the number of titles. Yet it is clearly insufficient to leave matters there. I will return to this point later. The second factor highlighted by the concept of [[biodiversity]] is balance, the balance between the [[species]]. If we look at what that means in biodiversity we see the extremely simple idea that if you have several species but some are present in huge numbers while others are very scarce, the ones with many units are likely to eat or prevail over the others. This is what is happening in the [[Publishing|book world]] where it is a matter for concern that the dominance of blockbusters on supermarket shelves and above all in [[bookstore]] displays is pushing out other offerings which are more difficult to promote.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Françoise| first = Benhamou| title =  Les Assises et leurs suites. Comptes rendus des Assises internationales de l’édition indépendante et programme prévisionnel d’action 2008–2009 de l’Alliance des éditeurs indépendants| publisher = International Alliance of Independent Publishers|  pages = 28–29|date = 7 October 2009| language = French| url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:anIGaloB6u4J:www.alliance-editeurs.org/IMG/pdf/FINAL.pdf+francoise+riviere+unesco+bibliodiversite&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=fr&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShEVtipoUfS5tt2Uo-LoFZg_no5RqrWU-5q5gkAS7TiF9yOEXabaeTFFLFJE6QwC54HykLIakGU2vZeMYmYqE3W_ZolGmh5jhz4-AJyNXLxX42TkoAkSvQfJU4QJBCGjGRj_GkB&amp;sig=AHIEtbRF4saSzApaaoKPZmuo9FDIOr6a5A| accessdate = 26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today bibliodiversity is under threat from [[overproduction]] and from financial [[concentration]] in the publishing world, which favours the predominance of a few large publishing groups and the pursuit of large [[profit margins]]. Increasing emphasis on [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] exacerbates the temptation to reshape editorial policy accordingly. In order to guarantee margins acceptable to shareholders who may be very distant from the publishing house (both physically and culturally), production is recalibrated to enhance its commercial potential. In some cases the result is a huge imbalance, with commercial logic vastly prevailing over intellectual adventurousness: here, the publisher unreservedly espouses demand-based economics to the detriment of its role of stimulating and purveying new ideas (offering texts which may be challenging, original, non-standard). At the far extreme of the concept of biodiversity, therefore, we find what we might call the “bestsellerisation” of the publishing sphere.

Given the increasing concentration of the publishing world, with its associated emphasis on profit and its trend towards bestsellerisation, independent publishers fulfil more than ever a role that has been abandoned in some cases by the “[[corporate]]” giants. This makes them the key players in bibliodiversity terms: they are genuine [[discoverers]] of talents, they are cultural risk-takers, they facilitate the existence and dissemination of the authors and texts of the future. This socially important role is clearly acknowledged by the major publishing groups – who frequently cherry-pick for themselves those authors who begin to gain public recognition.

Recognising the [[fundamental right]] to defend and promote their cultural sectors – in the face of a generalised [[deregulation]] which might at times appear to be the [[WTO]]’s desired aim – in late 2005 [[UNESCO]]’s member states signed the [[Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]]. Concrete measures could now be taken to protect bibliodiversity – [[cultural diversity]] in the [[Publishing|book world]].

== Current challenges ==

While there seems to be some progress on the protection of “local” cultural production, with governments seeking to create an enabling environment for the development of their [[cultural industries]] and decision-makers potentially [[empowered]] to act, it is becoming a matter of urgency to achieve some way of assessing [[:es:Bibliodiversidad|bibliodiversity]] via a set of indicators, via quantitative and [[qualitative data]].

Moreover, the [[digital revolution]] currently transforming the entire book world – from the creation of texts through to their marketing – could have significant impacts in terms of bibliodiversity. The [[dematerialization (products)|dematerialisation]] of the book, the possibility of virtual communications with a much larger group of contacts / readers / buyers (via e-marketing, for example) might suggest that independent publishers and publishers in [[emerging markets]] have the potential to raise their profile. On the other hand, the capturing of this emerging marketplace (as yet unproven in economic terms) by new players – online sales platforms, designers and manufacturers of IT equipment (readers in particular), etc. – suggests that the publication [[Operations management#Production systems|production system]] will reconfigure without promoting greater bibliodiversity at the same time.

== Use and promotion of the concept ==

Various [[international organisations]] such as [[UNESCO]] and the [[Latin Union]], various cultural and publishing [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] such as the Association Internationale des Libraires Francophones (international association of French-speaking booksellers), the [http://www.alliance-editeurs.org/ Alliance des Éditeurs Indépendants] (Alliance of Independent Publishers) and various national publisher associations (AEMI in Mexico, EDIN in Chile, EDINAR in Argentina, FIDARE in Italy, LIBRE in Brazil, etc.) are promoting and protecting bibliodiversity through symposia, meetings&lt;ref&gt;Guadalajara (2005) and Paris (2007), sponsored by UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; and declarations.&lt;ref&gt;Dakar Declaration (2003), Guadalajara Declaration (2005) and Paris Declaration (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

A reference work on bibliodiversity was published in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Group publication| title = Des paroles et des actes pour la bibliodiversité| publisher = International Alliance of Independent Publishers| year = 2006| location = Paris| pages = 288| language = French| isbn =978-2-9519747-3-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, following a letter addressed to the candidates in the French presidential election, the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' picked up several of the concrete measures proposed to promote bibliodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Alain|last=Beuve-Mery|title=Quelques idées pour le prochain gouvernement (Some ideas for the next government)|date=6 April 2007|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=983482|newspaper =Le Monde|location = Paris|language =French|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Spanish-speaking publishers from Latin America launched in 2010 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716015455/http://eldiab.org/ "El Dia B" ("the Bibliodiversity Day"], 21 September).

The first issue of an international journal entitled “Bibliodiversity”, co-published by the [http://www.alliance-editeurs.org/?lang=en International Alliance of Independent Publishers] and by Double Ponctuation (www.double-communication.com) appeared in January 2011 (see www.bibliodiversity.org).

== Quotations ==

Françoise Rivière, Assistant Director-General for Culture at UNESCO, in her speech opening the Assises Internationales de l'Édition Indépendante (International Assembly on Independent Publishing – Paris, July 2007): “Just as it seeks to highlight the complementary nature of the aims of biodiversity and cultural diversity on the global scene, UNESCO is also closely monitoring the issue of diversity of expression and content in the international book market.

A '''burial tree''' or '''burial scaffold''' is a tree or simple structure used for supporting [[corpse]]s or [[coffin]]s. They were once common among the [[Bali]]nese, the [[Naga people]], certain [[Aboriginal Australians]], and some [[North American First Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/603976/tree-burial&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America First Nations==
===Burial tree===

A number of Native Americans used a burial tree as the last resting place for a dead relative, either as the general rule (along with a scaffold) or as an alternative to a grave.&lt;ref name=Wood1987&gt;Wood, W. Raymond and Thomas D. Thiessen (1987): ''Early Fur Trade on the Northern Plains. Canadian Traders Among the Mandan and Hidatsa Indians, 1738-1818''. Norman and London.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}}&lt;ref name=Bowers1991&gt;Bowers, Alfred W.(1991): ''Mandan Social and Ceremonial Organization''. Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99}}

The corpse was wrapped up carefully in a [[Buffalo robe|robe]] or blankets and either placed in a fork of the tree&lt;ref name=Lowie1983&gt;Lowie, Robert H. (1983): ''The Crow Indians''. Lincoln and London.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} or tied to a heavy branch.&lt;ref name=Doyle2000&gt;Doyle, Susan B. (2000): ''Journeys to the Land of Gold. Emigrant Diaries from the Bozeman Trail, 1863-1866''. Helena.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|83}} Both grown persons and small children were laid to rest in this way.&lt;ref name=Doyle2000/&gt;{{rp|83 and 385}} A burial tree could carry more than one dead.&lt;ref name=Doyle2000/&gt;{{rp|112}} Maximilian zu Wied saw burial trees with red painted trunk and branches among the Assiniboine Indians.&lt;ref name=Bushnell1927&gt;Bushnell Jr., D. I. (1927): ''Burials of the Algonquian, Siouan and Caddoan Tribes West of the Mississippi''. Smithsonian Institution. Bureau of American Ethnology. Bulletin 83. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45-46}} It seems any tree was proper. [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|Cottonwood]]&lt;ref name=Doyle2000/&gt;{{rp|112}} is mentioned by travelers on the great plains, as well as [[pine]]&lt;ref name=Doyle2000/&gt;{{rp|83}} and cedar.&lt;ref name=Unrau1979&gt;Unrau, William E. (1990): ''Tending the Talking Wire. A Buck Soldier's View of Indian Country, 1863-1866''. Salt Lake City.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|69}} The dead could be placed from around six feet up in the tree to close to the top.&lt;ref name=Doyle2000/&gt;{{rp|112}} Some of the belongings of the deceased were often placed near the corpse.

===Scaffold===

A burial scaffold was usually made of four upright poles or branches, forked at the top. This foundation carried a sort of bier, where the dead body was laid to rest out of reach of wolves. The preferred location was on a hill.&lt;ref name=Doyle2000/&gt;{{rp|83}} Relatives would often place some of the belongings of the dead on the platform or around the scaffold.&lt;ref name=Wood1987/&gt;{{rp|87}}

The poles reached "a mans height above ground" (six to eight feet).&lt;ref name=Wood1987/&gt;{{rp|87}}&lt;ref name=Darwin2004&gt;Darwin, Charles B.: "1,000 Miles From Home on the Wild Prairie".

(Typescript). The Newberry Library, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}} An extraordinary high scaffold carried the corpse of a [[Dakota people|Sisseton Sioux]] an estimated 18 feet above the ground.&lt;ref name=Bushnell1927/&gt;{{rp|23}} One scaffold described had poles painted black and red in horizontal stripes.&lt;ref name=Libby1920&gt;Libby, Orin G. (1920): ''The Arikara Narrative''. Bismarck.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75}} An 1849 Nebraska traveler saw a scaffold made of [[Tipi|lodge poles]] rested against each other at the top and with two biers half way down.&lt;ref name=Darwin2004/&gt;{{rp|102}}

An [[Ojibwe]] man would get his arms and other personal effects with him on the scaffold along with food, eating utensils and [[tobacco]].&lt;ref name=Wood1987/&gt;{{rp|87}} This practice may have been used only as a temporarily solution when death occurred far from the common burial ground with graves and markers. Birch bark served as an option to a body wrapping of skin among the Ojibwe.&lt;ref name=Densmore1929&gt;Densmore, Frances (1929): ''Chippewa Customs''. Smithsonian Institution. Bureau of American Ethnology. Bulletin 86.  Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76}}

In the 18th century, the [[Choctaw]] placed the dead on a scaffold as a first step in a burial process. Months later, bone pickers stripped the flesh from the bones. The skeleton was then cleaned and piece by piece put in a sort of small coffin and lastly placed in the Indian city's special bone house.&lt;ref name=Bushnell1920&gt;Bushnell Jr., D. I. (1920): ''Native Cemeteries and Forms of Burial East of the Mississippi''. Smithsonian Institution. Bureau of American Ethnology. Bulletin 71. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94}}

The personal effects of an Indian woman were laid with her in an open pine box (likely made by a carpenter) situated on a scaffold put up near [[Fort Laramie]] in 1866. The heads and tails of her two ponies were fastened to respectively the eastern and the western poles.&lt;ref name=Diaries/&gt;{{rp|21}}

Among the [[Crow Nation|Crow]], the dead was wrapped in a robe and placed on the bier with the feet to the east. Much later, the bones could be collected and placed in a rock gap.&lt;ref name=Lowie1983/&gt;{{rp|67}}

The [[Mandan]] Indians positioned the dead body on the scaffold with the feet to the southeast, so the spirit was directed to the old Mandan country around [[Heart River (North Dakota)|Heart River]], [[North Dakota]].&lt;ref name=Bowers1991/&gt;{{rp|99}} With the scaffold rotten and on the ground, the bones were wrapped in a hide and buried in the refuse at the Mandan village or in a riverbank.&lt;ref name=Bowers1991/&gt;{{rp|101}} The skull would be placed among other clan skulls arranged in circles on the ground near the scaffolds.&lt;ref name=Bowers1991/&gt;{{rp|100}} Newborns, who died unnamed, were not considered members of the society and hence placed in trees (or buried) away from the common burial ground outside the village.&lt;ref name=Bowers1991/&gt;{{rp|98}}

===Reasons for burials in trees and on scaffolds===

During winter, the [[Ponca]] Indians would often substitute a grave with a scaffold because the ground was frozen.&lt;ref name=Howard1965&gt;Howard, J.H (1965): ''The Ponca Tribe''. Smithsonian Institution. Bureau of American Ethnology. Bulletin 195. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} A Lakota summed up the reasons why a high scaffold outdid a grave, "(1) Animals or persons might walk over the graves; (2) the dead might lie in mud and water after rain or snow; (3) wolves might dig up the bodies and devour them."&lt;ref name=Dorsey1894&gt;Dorsey, J.O (1894): ''A Study of Siouan Cults''. Smithsonian Institution. 11th Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology. 1889-'90. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|486}} With the dead placed on a scaffold or in a tree, the relatives could easily talk to the deceased.&lt;ref name=Denig1930&gt;Denig, E. T. (1930): ''The Assiniboine''. Smithsonian Institution. 46th Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology. 1928-'29. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|571}}

__NOTOC__
The '''Chokwe people''', known by many other names (including '''Kioko''', '''Bajokwe''', '''Chibokwe''', '''Kibokwe''', '''Ciokwe''', '''Cokwe''' or '''Badjok'''), are an [[ethnic group]] of [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[Southern Africa]]. They are found primarily in [[Angola]], southwestern parts of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Kinshasa to Lualaba), and northwestern parts of [[Zambia]].&lt;ref name=britchowke&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chokwe Chowke people], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics and language==
Estimated to be about 1.3 million,&lt;ref name=britchowke/&gt; their ancestry is likely mixed and traced to aboriginal [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]] and [[Mbuti]] [[Pygmies]]. Their language is usually referred to as [[Chokwe language|Chokwe]] (or Kichokwe, Tshokwe), a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language in the Benue-Congo branch of Niger-Congo family of languages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/cjk Cokwe], Ethnologue (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many also speak the official languages of their countries: [[english language|English]] in [[Zambia]], [[French language|French]] in [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (as first or second language) in Angola.

==History==
{{double image|left|Chokwe people Angola Congo Zambia.jpg|180|Angola tribes 1970.jpg|133|Left: Chokwe people distribution in Angola, Congo and Zambia (approx); Right: Angola ethnic groups map.}}

The Chokwe were once one of the twelve clans of the great [[Lunda Empire]] of 17th- and 18th-century [[Angola]].&lt;ref name="Asante2009p165"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Molefi Kete Asante|author2=Ama Mazama|title=Encyclopedia of African Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B667ATiedQkC |year=2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-3636-1|pages=165–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were initially employed by Lunda nobles, eventually became independent when they refused to continue paying tribute to the Lunda emperor. Their successful trading and abundant resources caused them to be one of the wealthiest groups in Angola. By 1900, the Chokwe had dismantled the Lunda kingdom (also called the ''Mwata Yanvo'') altogether, using guns they had received in trade from the [[Ovimbundu]]. Chokwe language and influence then began to dominate northeastern Angola and spread among the Lunda peoples. As the wars and conflicts grew during the colonial era of the 19th and 20th centuries, both from Europeans from their west and the Swahili-Arabs from their east, they militarily responded and expanded further into northern Angola, Congo and into western Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy Black|title=War in the Modern World Since 1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8RRUAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-40233-3|pages=175–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Manuel Jordán|title=Chokwe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ejao3vG6nfsC&amp;pg=PA11|year=1998|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-1990-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Miller|editor=Richard Gray and David Birmingham|title=Pre-Colonial African Trade: essays on trade in Central and Eastern Africa before 1900|chapter=Chokwe Trade and Conquest in the Nineteenth Century| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sAuLAAAAIAAJ|year=1970|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese had virtually no contact with the Chokwe until the 1930s when the Chokwe traded [[beeswax|wax]], [[rubber]] and [[ivory]]. The Portuguese brought an end to the dominance of the Chokwe people in the region, but the Chokwe people fought back.

As a [[prince]], [[Mwene Mbandu Kapova I of Mbunda]] played a significant role in the battle between the Chokwe and the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]].

===Slavery===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, Chokwe people not only suffered from the consequences of slave capture and export, but themselves bought and kept slaves.&lt;ref name="Martin1995p126"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Phyllis Martin|author2=Patrick O'Meara|title=Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OAGPMAExRz8C&amp;pg=PA126 |year=1995|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-20984-6|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oppen1993p285"&gt;{{cite book|author=Achim von Oppen|title=Terms of Trade and Terms of Trust: The History and Contexts of Pre-colonial Market Production Around the Upper Zambezi and Kasai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=an5QqSKNqAgC&amp;pg=PA285|year=1993|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-89473-246-2|pages=285–291 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lunda nobles of Angola employed the Chokwe people as soldiers and hunters, first to counter the violence and threats to indigenous political power brought by the colonial demand and export markets for slaves, but once the Chokwe people had the guns, training and ethnic coordination, they overthrew the Lunda and employed slaves on their own for farming and domestic work in the second half of the 19th-century and the early decades of the 20th.&lt;ref name="Martin1995p126"/&gt; The slaves sourced from other ethnic groups of Africa became a prized possession sought by the Chokwe. In upper Zambezi river and Kasai regions particularly, they were once a victim of well armed Portuguese or Belgian raids from the West and Arab-Swahili raids from east (such as by [[Tippu Tip]] also known as Hamad bin Muhammad el Murjebi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Shillington|title=History of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YdscBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA259|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-00333-1|pages=259–263}}&lt;/ref&gt;); later, the Chokwe people joined the violence and victimized others by capturing and shipping out a substantial number of captured slaves for financial gains, as well as purchasing and keeping slave women in their own homes from the profits of their craft work.&lt;ref name="Oppen1993p285"/&gt;&lt;ref name=olivertippu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Aldrich|author2=Kirsten McKenzie|title=The Routledge History of Western Empires|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFRJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA461 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-99987-4|pages=461–464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Achim von Oppen, the use of slaves among the Chokwe people was likely a cultural reality on a small scale, before the enormous growth in slave capture and trading activity for the Atlantic colonial market. The old practice had origins in inter-village disputes particularly after injury or murder, where the victim village sought revenge or a slave in compensation for the loss. In cases of giving up a person, it would preferably be a transfer of a child as a slave from the village that caused the loss.&lt;ref name="Oppen1993p285"/&gt; As the demand and financial returns of slave trade to the colonial markets grew, many slaves were captured or otherwise passed through the Chokwe controlled territory. They would allow the movement of slave men to continue west towards the ports in cooperation with the Portuguese, while women were often kept.&lt;ref name="Oppen1993p285"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Manuel Jordán|title=Chokwe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ejao3vG6nfsC&amp;pg=PA29|year=1998|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-1990-1|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice continued long after slavery was banned in Europe and the United States, but the demand for workers elsewhere such as in South America, the Caribbean, Swahili-Arabs, [[Oman]]i and other colonial plantations market continued, feeding a smuggled slaves market.&lt;ref name=gordon1840&gt;{{cite book|author=David Gordon|editor=Robert Ross et al|title=The Objects of Life in Central Africa: The History of Consumption and Social Change, 1840-1980|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ifuZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 |year=2013|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-25624-8|pages=30–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=olivertippu&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roland Oliver|author2=Anthony Atmore|title=Africa since 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCrtyqyyp8wC&amp;pg=PA81|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-44398-2|pages=81–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; European explorers who visited the Chokwe villages in early 20th-century reported that a majority of the women there were slaves in polygamous households and a cause of their population boom.&lt;ref name="Oppen1993p285"/&gt; In certain regions, like other ethnic groups and Europeans, the Chokwe people used slaves to raid their neighbors for lucrative ivory stockpiles for exports as well as to counter the raids by militarized Arab-Swahili gangs seeking ivory stockpiles and tribute payments.&lt;ref name=gordon1840/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John E.

The Chowke people live in woodland [[savanna]], but are also found along rivers and marshland with strips of rainforest.&lt;ref name="Jordan1998p12"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manuel Jordán|title=Chokwe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ejao3vG6nfsC&amp;pg=PA11|year=1998|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-1990-1|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the north, the Chokwe are known as skilled hunters. In south, their livelihood has traditionally centered around cultivation of staple crops such as [[cassava]], yams, millet, beans, peanuts and corn (maize). Pastoral activity with cattles is also a part of the southern Chokwe people's life.&lt;ref name=britchowke/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jordan1998p11"/&gt;

They are regionally famous for their exceptional crafts work, particularly with baskets, pottery, mask carving, statues, stools and other handicrafts.&lt;ref name=britchowke/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jordan1998p11"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manuel Jordán|title=Chokwe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ejao3vG6nfsC&amp;pg=PA11|year=1998|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-1990-1|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art work include utilitarian objects, but often integrates Chokwe mythologies, oral history and spiritual beliefs. For example, the culture hero ''Chibinda Ilunga'' who married a Lunda woman and took over power is an often sculpted figure. The ''Cikungu'' art personifies the collective power of Chokwe's ancestors, while ''Mwana po'' figurines depict the guardians of fertility and procreation. The ''Ngombo'' figurines have been traditionally a part of divining spirits who are shaken to tell causes of illness, misfortune, not having babies and other problems faced by a family or a village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hope B.

Both chiefs and village groups are found in the Chokwe culture. Villages consist of company compounds with square huts or circular grass-houses with a central space that serves as the meeting place for the villagers.&lt;ref name=britchowke/&gt;

The Chokwe are traditionally a matrilineal society, but where the woman moves to live with her husband's family after wedding. Polygyny has been a historic practice usually limited to the chief or a wealthy family.&lt;ref name=britchowke/&gt;

The traditional religious beliefs of the Chokwe center around ancestor spirits worship.&lt;ref name="Asante2009p165"/&gt; In groups where chiefs exist, they are considered the representative of god Kalunga or Nzambi, therefore revered and called ''Mwanangana'' or "overseer of the land". The Chokwe people believe that works of arts such as handicrafts and carved objects are spiritual, connect them to their ancestors and god Kalunga or Nzambi. With the colonial era, Chowke converted to Christianity en masse yet the original beliefs were retained to produce a syncretism of beliefs and practices.&lt;ref name="Asante2009p165"/&gt; They have, for example, continued their spirit-rituals from pre-Christian era, as well maintained their elaborate rites-of-passage ceremonies particularly to mark the entry into adulthood by men and women.&lt;ref name=britchowke/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asante2009p165"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
A Chokwe statue, Chokwe body carvings, blood diamonds, and the Chokwe people figure into the plotline of [[Donna Leon]]'s 14th Commissario Guido Brunetti mystery novel, ''[[Donna Leon#Commissario Guido Brunetti novels|Blood From a Stone]]'' (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leon, Donna|title=Blood From a Stone|date=2005|isbn=0-87113-887-5|publisher=Atlantic Monthly}} (e.g., in Chapters 26 and 27)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Kirkus |title=Review: ''Blood From a Stone'' by Donna Leon|date=2005|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/donna-leon/blood-from-a-stone/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conversion to Islam in U.S. prisons''' refers to the higher rate of [[conversion to Islam]] in [[American prisons]], for which there are a number of factors. It is the fastest-growing religion in U.S. prisons (when conversions to Protestantism and Catholicism are not combined).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/03/22/prison-chaplains-exec/ |title=Religion in Prisons – A 50-State Survey of Prison Chaplains |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=22 Mar 2012 |website=pewforum.org  |access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US prison population is 9 percent Muslim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/234653/religious-affiliation-of-us-prisoners/ |title=Mean religious affiliation of inmates in U.S. prisons, as reported by prison chaplains in 2011 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2011 |website=statista.com |access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (compared to 1 percent for [[Muslims in the United States|the general population]]).

==Rate of conversion to Islam==
In addition to immigration, the state, federal and local [[incarceration in the United States|prisons of the United States]] may be a contributor to the growth of [[Islam in the United States]]. J. Michael Waller claims that Muslim inmates comprise 17–20% of the prison population in New York, or roughly 350,000 inmates in 2003. He also claims that 80% of the prisoners who "find faith" while in prison convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/waller_testimony_10_14_03.pdf United State Senate, Committee on the Judiciary , Testimony of Dr. J. Michael Waller] October 14, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; These converted inmates are [[African-American Muslims|mostly African American]], with a growing Hispanic minority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1652121 SpearIt, Raza Islamica: Prisons, Hip Hop &amp; Converting Converts] August 3, 2010 (revised February 27, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Waller also asserts that many converts are radicalized by outside [[Islamism|Islamist]] groups linked to terrorism, but other experts suggest that when radicalization does occur, it has little to no connection with these outside interests.&lt;ref name="fbi_testimony"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress06/vanduyn092006.htm |title=Statement of  Van Duyn, Deputy Assistant Director, Counterterrorism Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation, before the House Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Terrorism Risk Assessment |date=2006-09-20 |accessdate=2009-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512130102/http://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress06/vanduyn092006.htm |archivedate=May 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rogers_testimony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=960&amp;wit_id=2717 |title=Testimony of Mr. Paul Rogers, President of the American Correctional Chaplains Association |date=2003-10-12 |publisher=United State Senate Committee on the Judiciary, |accessdate=2009-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828205813/http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=960&amp;wit_id=2717 |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doj_report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/0404/final.pdf|title=Special Report: A Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Selection of Muslim Religious Services Providers – Full Report|date=April 2004|publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concern in the United States==
Concern over jailhouse conversions to Islam first rose in 2001 when Imam [[Warith Deen Umar]], Islamic chaplain for the [[New York State prison system]], was reported to have praised the [[September 11 attacks]]; in response members of Congress called for an investigation.&lt;ref name="NYT_Imams"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/nyregion/24convert.html?ref=us|title=Imams Reject Talk That Islam Radicalizes Inmates|last=Wakin|first=Daniel J.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2009-05-24|accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2004 report, the Justice Department faulted the prison system for failing to protect against “infiltration by religious extremists.” However, the report made clear that the problem was not chaplains, but rather unsupervised inmates.&lt;ref name="NYT_Imams" /&gt;

In 2006, then FBI director [[Robert Mueller]] described the Islamist conversion movement operating throughout U.S. prisons, to a Senate committee. He said that prisons were a “fertile ground” for [[Islamic extremist]]s, and that they targeted inmates for introduction to the militant [[Wahhabi]] and [[Salafist]] strains of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/21/u-s-prisons-churning-out-thousands-of-radicalized-inmates.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark S. Hamm]], a criminologist at [[Indiana State University]], describes a phenomenon he calls "prison Islam." This consists of "small gang-like cliques that use cut-and-paste versions of the Koran" to give a religious patina to violent and criminal activities. Hamm has identified five such examples since 2005, notably the [[2005 Los Angeles bomb plot]].&lt;ref name="NYT_Imams" /&gt;

In January 2010, [[John Kerry]] released a report that stated: "Three dozen U.S. citizens who converted to Islam while in prison have traveled to Yemen, possibly for Al Qaeda training."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roots of violent radicalisation: nineteenth report of session 2010-12, Vol. 1: Report, together with formal minutes, oral and written evidence, Volume 1|author=

Historically, there was a significant [[French people|French]] community residing in [[Hungary]], who firstly came during the 11–13th century and then, once more, in a separate wave of settlement starting in the 18th century. Their descendants are today self-reported Hungarians in national censuses, with several of them having French surnames. The vast majority of today's French people living in Hungary have arrived since the [[Fall of the Iron Curtain]].

==History==
Several prominent noble families of Hungary originate from [[France]] or from [[Wallonia]] (e.g. Baron L’Huillier-Coburg, Baron Maillot de la Treille, Baron Toussainet, Baron Thierry, Baron Mandat-Grancey, Baron Deschan, Baron Montluisant, Baron Piret de Bihain, Baron Ransonnet, Earl Souches, Earl Sermage etc.).

===Middle Ages===
The first French settlers came to Hungary immediately after the foundation of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Among the settled foreigners, Germans were overwhelming in the majority, however, according to researches of ''Mihály Auner'' among others proofs that the immigration of the French element besides the German played also a significant role in the life of Hungarians. In the official documents during the [[Árpád dynasty|rule of the Árpáds]] the true meaning of the often occurring words ''latinus'' and ''olasz'' meant not the [[Italian people]], but all peoples speaking [[Neo Latin languages]] (Italian, French, Spanish etc.).&lt;ref&gt;(in Hungarian) Zsoldos, Attila. "[http://www.tti.hu/images/kiadvanyok/folyoiratok/tsz/tsz2008-3/435-451zsoldos.pdf The Citizens of Fehérvár in the Arpadian Age]" ("Fehérvár Árpád-kori polgárságáról") ''TÖRTÉNELMI SZEMLE L'' (2008), 3. pp. 435–451. English abstract available.&lt;/ref&gt; (In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] today the word ''olasz'' means Italian. At that time the word ''talján'' or ''Lombardus'' was in use for people of the Italian peninsula.) ''Latini'' in the Middle Ages was the common name of mainly members of the [[Western Christianity|Western Congregation]], while ''Graeci'' stood for the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Church]] proponents. According to historians the name of Hungarian settlements containing the word ''olasz'' or ''olaszi'' could meant [[Walloons|Walloon]] or [[French people|French]], because in [[German language|German]] they are translated as ''wallen''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/20789/1/szephalom_009_003-008.pdf István Németh - A magyarországi francia telepek]&lt;/ref&gt;

The French/Walloons settled especially in [[Upper Hungary]] (in [[Eger]], in [[Spiš]] and in [[Tokaj-Hegyalja]]) and [[Transylvania]] (in [[Kolozsvár]], in [[Szatmár]] and in Várad-Olaszi (part of [[Nagyvárad]])). The oldest among them was their settlement in Eger, which was already established likely in 1046. Several linguists (e.g. Géza Bárczi, János Melich and others) have assumed the Walloon-French origin of many of Hungarian place names, which can only be explained by the fact that they were founded by the French&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/20789/1/szephalom_009_003-008.pdf István Németh - A magyarországi francia telepek]&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[Tállya]] from ''taille'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tokaj-turizmus.hu/Tallya Tokaj-Turizmus - Tállya]&lt;/ref&gt; According to János Melich it can be proofed with documents that between 1042 and 1048 Walloon and French settlers came to Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/10395/1/fold_006_001_060-064.pdf Apró közlemények]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Transdanubia]], the town of [[Esztergom]] had a large number of French people living there. French names can be found among the members of the City Council until the 18th century. Esztergom was located along important commercial routes, and this lucky circumstance has made the town a center of commercial life in the Árpád era. Foreign merchants met here and changed their goods, many of them settled in the city. [[Roger of Torre Maggiore|Master Roger]] called the French of Esztergom ''Francigenae''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/20789/1/szephalom_009_003-008.pdf István Németh - A magyarországi francia telepek]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fruška Gora]] ({{lang-en|French Mountain}}) (today in [[Serbia]]) was also named after French settlers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/10395/1/fold_006_001_060-064.pdf Apró közlemények]&lt;/ref&gt; The names mentioned in medieval documents ''Gallus'', ''Gallicus'', ''Francus'' also refer to French origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/20789/1/szephalom_009_003-008.pdf István Németh - A magyarországi francia telepek]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beside the merchants and peasants from France and Walloonia priests, monks, missionaries and church dignitaries came to Hungary in large numbers many of whom brought their compatriots to their ecclesiastical headquarters (e.g. [[Leodvin]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Oradea Mare|Bishop of Nagyvárad]] (r. c. 1050 – c. 1060) in [[Nagyvárad]]; [[Bonipert]], [[Bishop of Pécs]] (r. 1009-1036) and [[Bartholomew le Gros]], Bishop of Pécs (r. 1219-1251) in [[Pécs]]; [[Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom|Robert]], [[Archbishop of Esztergom]] (r. 1226-1239) in [[Esztergom]]). The first monks of the [[Cistercian]] Monasteries of [[Egres]], [[Zirc]], [[Pásztó]], [[Szentgotthárd]] and [[Pilis Mountains]] were also French. These were built during the reign of [[Béla III of Hungary|Béla III]] who was known to have maintained good relations with the French and invited French craftsmen to Hungary to rebuild his royal palace and the cathedral in Esztergom. In 1091, King [[Saint Ladislaus]] founded the [[Somogyvár Abbey]] in [[Somogyvár]] whose monks could only be French until 1204.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/20789/1/szephalom_009_003-008.pdf István Németh - A magyarországi francia telepek]&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of medieval French settlements is also evident in the linguistic history of the [[Hungarian language]]. In spelling for the Hungarian ''cs'' (/tʃ/) sound the letters ''ch'', for the ''ny'' (/ɲ/) sound the letters ''nh'' and for the ''sz'' (/s/) sound before ''i'' and ''e'' the letters ''sc'' came into use. Also several Hungarian words are of Walloon-French origin according to studies of ''Géza Bárczy''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/20789/1/szephalom_009_003-008.pdf István Németh - A magyarországi francia telepek]&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval French settlers with time assimilated into the Hungarian, ''Flandrenses'' and German (mainly [[Zipser German]] and [[Transylvanian Saxon]]) population. The supposition that Walloons of [[Nagyvárad]] used the French language still in the 14th century is made probable by the fact that they had French priest, ''Jean sacerdos de Olazi'' in 1330. According to [[Miklós Oláh]] the Walloons of [[Eger]] spoke French in 1536.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/20789/1/szephalom_009_003-008.pdf István Németh - A magyarországi francia telepek]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banat French===
[[File:Claude Florimond de Mercy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Count Claudius Florimund de Mercy]] (1666 – 1734), Imperial field marshal who coordinated the immigration of French settlers]]
During the [[Great Turkish War]] the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] could not liberate the whole territory of medieval Hungary from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]]. The [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] (1699) ended the war in which the two parties agreed to accept the new borders between the [[Habsburg Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] which meant that the historical region of [[Banat]] stayed under Turkish rule. This agreement stayed in force until the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] (1718) ending the [[Austro-Turkish War (1716–1718)]] in which [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] and his army recaptured the [[Banat]]. 

The Banat was in terrible condition at that time: the once densely populated area was almost completely uninhabited. Its residents died during the wars or escaped from the Ottoman oppression. The former Christian territory lost its buildings and churches, several of them were rebuilt to mosques. During the Ottoman rule huge areas of land became unproductive because it was not cultivated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/20789/1/szephalom_009_003-008.pdf István Németh - A magyarországi francia telepek]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Count Claude Florimond de Mercy]] field marshal trusted of reviving this region. He founded new villages and invited settlers from different Christian territories (e.g. Germany, Italy, France, Spain etc.). Most of the settlers were [[Banat Swabians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/20789/1/szephalom_009_003-008.pdf István Németh - A magyarországi francia telepek]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known French settled in the region was a postman named ''Miklós Noël'' in [[Lugoj|Lugos]] in 1724.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/20789/1/szephalom_009_003-008.pdf István Németh - A magyarországi francia telepek]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first wave of French immigrants came from [[Lorraine]] and settled in [[Dudeștii Noi|Neu-Beschenowa]] in the summer of 1748. At that time the danger of an Ottoman attack was possible, so [[Maria Theresa]] order them to complete a military training to be able to fight in case of a war. French settlers can be found among the first residents of the newly established [[Sânandrei|St Andreas]] in 1750. They all came from Lorraine one part speaking French and the other German.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvhh.org/history/1700s/banat-colonization-after-turks.htm#Top The Colonisation of the Banat Following its Occupation - Donauschwaben Villages Helping Hands]&lt;/ref&gt;

French started to immigrate in larger numbers after 1763. According to ''László Marjanucz'' the earlier immigrants came mainly from [[Lorraine]], [[Alsace]], [[Luxembourg (Belgium)]] and [[Luxembourg]], then later from regions of [[Metz]], [[Besançon]] and [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/MEGY_CSON_EK_SHST_05/?pg=16&amp;layout=s&amp;query=francia László Marjanucz - Adalékok Habsburg berendezkedés és telepítés a bánsági történetéhez]&lt;/ref&gt; Mercydorf was founded in 1735 and named after [[Count Claudius Florimund de Mercy]]. Its first residents were only Italians - 21 family in 1756. It was the only Italian dominated settlement of the Banat. During the years from 1769 to 1771 French settled in the village and they became the majority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvhh.org/history/1700s/banat-colonization-after-turks.htm#Top The Colonisation of the Banat Following its Occupation - Donauschwaben Villages Helping Hands]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1770 and 1771 the immigration reached its highest peak.

The treasury offered the immigrants support and greater freedom which made them interested in immigration to the Banat. They got land to cultivate, could build houses with the help of the treasury and tax exemption for years. The royal court always kept their interests in mind and made decisions in their benefit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/20789/1/szephalom_009_003-008.pdf István Németh - A magyarországi francia telepek]&lt;/ref&gt; They had the opportunity to take a loan (the so called ''Antizipation'') which they had to pay back after three years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvhh.org/history/1700s/banat-colonization-after-turks.htm#Top The Colonisation of the Banat Following its Occupation - Donauschwaben Villages Helping Hands]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the beginning of the 19th century they assimilated into the [[Banat Swabian]] majority, a few into the Hungarians. Nowadays just their names show their French origin, but they do not speak [[French language|French]] anymore. The longest existed their community in the three villages of [[Banatsko Veliko Selo|Saint-Hubert]], [[Banatsko Veliko Selo|Charleville]] and [[Banatsko Veliko Selo|Seultour]] where they stayed in majority for a long time. In the 1830s they still sung French chants during their worships, the evangelium was read in both German and French, and the preachings were held in German and French. But in just over a hundred years, the French language has also disappeared in these villages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/20789/1/szephalom_009_003-008.pdf István Németh - A magyarországi francia telepek]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the 19th century several French travellers visited the villages. [[Charles Lemercier de Longpré, baron d'Haussez]] reported about them in 1835. Later [[Henri, Count of Chambord]] travelled there and he became so fond of the them that he bought the land and five villages - [[Novi Kozarci|Mastort]], [[Novi Kozarci|Heufeld]], [[Banatsko Veliko Selo|Saint-Hubert]], [[Banatsko Veliko Selo|Charleville]] and [[Banatsko Veliko Selo|Seultour]] - for 1.3 million [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|Forints]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvhh.org/history/1700s/banat-colonization-after-turks.htm#Top The Colonisation of the Banat Following its Occupation - Donauschwaben Villages Helping Hands]&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Hecht, a professor of the University of Nancy visited the French villages of the Banat in 1876. He already did not find anybody speaking French and several surnames were incorrectly recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvhh.org/history/1700s/banat-colonization-after-turks.htm#Top The Colonisation of the Banat Following its Occupation - Donauschwaben Villages Helping Hands]&lt;/ref&gt; The officers who came to the villages in most cases could not speak French so they wrote several names improperly, really often with German spelling. There were also some illiterate among the settlers who could not correct the spelling errors. Here is a list of names of some residents of [[Banatsko Veliko Selo|Charleville]]: Ludwig Chapellie, Katharina Schirmon, Jean Düpolt, Ludwig Simono, Claude La Fleur, Joseph Piko, Anton Poussin, Karl Pigeot, Jean Peter, Le Cler, Hanry Cordie, Remillion Soissong, Jean Francois Quylion. With time several surnames changed as the population started to speak rather German. Some names were written in German: e.g. Picard -&gt; Pikar, Bikar; Laurent -&gt; Loran; Leblanc -&gt; Löblan, Leblang, Leblanc; Marchand -&gt; Marschang; Mougeon -&gt; Muschong; Collin -&gt; Kolleng; Aubertin -&gt; Oberting, Oberden; Guilleaume -&gt; Gilion, Giljon, Giljum; while others in Hungarian: Merle -&gt; Merlei, Martin -&gt; Martén, Houilon -&gt; Hujjón.&lt;ref&gt;(in Hungarian) Palásti, László. "[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/17330/1/tanarkepzo_1958_1_155-175.pdf  Palásti - Franciák és a francia nyelv a Bánátban a XVIII. és a XIX. században]." pp. 155-175. Abstracts in Russian (as "ФРАНЦУЗЫ И ФРАНЦУЗСКИЙ ЯЗЫК в БАНАТЕ В 18 И 19 ВЕКАХ") and German (as "FRANZOSEN UND DIE FRANZÖSISCHE SPRACHE IM BANAT IM XVIII. UND XIX. JAHRHUNDERTEN").&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Second World War most of their communities were expelled. 7,000 of them were welcomed in [[France]]. In [[La Roque-sur-Pernes]], [[France]] they still have a compact community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvhh.org/history/1700s/banat-colonization-after-turks.htm#Top The Colonisation of the Banat Following its Occupation - Donauschwaben Villages Helping Hands]&lt;/ref&gt;

Researches of ''Lajos Baróti'', ''Antal Bodor'', ''Lénárt Bőhm'', ''Louis Hecht'', ''Jenő Szentkláray'' and ''Rogér Schilling'' provide information of the French settlements of the [[Banat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/20789/1/szephalom_009_003-008.pdf István Németh - A magyarországi francia telepek]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Banat several of them moved to other parts of Hungary. Hungarians having French surnames can be found mainly in [[Szeged]] (e.g. Chambré, Cherrier, Christophe, Dippong, Frecot, Gilde, Giljon, Giljum, Kahlesz, Leblanc, Massong, Merle, Muschong, Noel, Oberting, Piar, Pierre, Pétri, Potier, Schorsch, Stufle, Vitye, Wottreng etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/17330/1/tanarkepzo_1958_1_155-175.pdf László Palásti - Franciák és a francia nyelv a Bánátban a XVIII. és a XIX. században]&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known Hungarians of Banat French descent are ''Alessandro Bonnaz'', [[Alajos Degré]], ''Miklós Cherrier''&lt;ref&gt;[http://acta.bibl.u-szeged.hu/20789/1/szephalom_009_003-008.pdf István Németh - A magyarországi francia telepek]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Jacob Muschong]] and [[Győző Leblanc]].

The '''Gurunsi''', or '''Grunshi''', are a set of related ethnic groups inhabiting northern [[Ghana]] and south and central [[Burkina Faso]].

==Pre-colonial history and origins==
Oral traditions of the Gurunsi hold that they originated from the western Sudan near [[Lake Chad]].  While it is unknown when the migration occurred, it is believed that the Gurunsi were present in their current location by 1100 AD.  Following the 15th century, when the [[Mossi Kingdoms|Mossi]] states were established to the north, Mossi horsemen often raided Gurunsi areas for slaves, but the Gurunsi peoples were never fully subjugated, remaining independent.

According to doctor Salif Titamba Lankoande, in ''Noms de famille (Patronymes) au Burkina Faso'', the name Gurunsi comes from the [[Zarma language|Djerma]] language of [[Niger]] words “Guru-si”, which means “iron does not penetrate”.  It is said that during the Djerma invasions of Gurunsi lands in the late 19th century, a Djerma jihadist leader by the name of Baba Ato Zato (better known by the [[Hausa language|Hausa]] corruption of his name: Babatu) recruited a battalion of indigenous men for his army, who after having consumed traditional medicines, were said to be invulnerable to iron.

==Partition==
The people who speak closely related [[Gur languages]] and dialects and classed by the Moose under the umbrella term Gurunse form an arc of village communities mostly organised as defensive strongholds from the Koudougou residency west and northwest of Ouagadougou in colonial times to the northeast of current day Ghana. This area became in the late 1890s part of a three-way competition between the colonial forces of the French, the British, and the Germans, trying to subdue Djerma warlords and fight also the warlike local population who resisted fiercely to maintain its autonomy, while vying to occupy as much territory as possible at the expense of rival colonial powers. Each of the three claimed part or the territory occupied by the Gourounsi villages, but the competition between the colonial powers was not resolved until the last year of the 19th century.  After establishing the protectorates of [[Yatenga]] (1895) and [[Ouagadougou]] (1896), the French annexed Gurunsi lands in 1897.  Eventually the Germans withdrew to [[Togoland]] (modern Ghana &amp; Togo), and an 1898 Anglo-French agreement officially established the boundary with the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now Ghana).  This partition divided Gurunsi peoples among French and British administrative systems, facilitating the political and cultural divergence of sub-groups on each side of the boundary.

==Sub-groups==
There are numerous ethnic sub-groups among the Gurunsi, such as: the [[Frafra people|Frafra]], [[Kusasi]], [[Nabt]] and [[Talensi]] in Ghana; the [[Ko people|Ko]], [[Lyele people|Lyele]], [[Nuni]] and [[Sisaala]] in Burkina Faso.  The sub-groups [[Kassena]] and [[Nankani]] inhabit both Ghana and Burkina Faso.  Although characterized by neither a common language nor common political institutions, the social, economic, and religious practices of these sub-groups are sufficiently similar for them to constitute a distinct cultural unit.

== Art and architecture ==
The Gurunsi people of [[Tiébélé Department|Tiébéle]] are known for their cob homes which are built by the men and decorated on the exterior with geometric patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/hg/index.ssf/2013/02/from_the_home_front_flintstone.html|title=From the Home Front: 'Flintstones' architecture; decorated cob homes; architectural jewelry; Roof House|last=Jeffiries|first=Pat|date=7 February 2013|work=Oregon Live|access-date=8 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hong Kong Canadians''' or '''Canadians of Hong Kong origin''' ({{zh|香港裔加拿大人}} or {{lang|zh|加拿大港人}}) are Canadian citizens who identify themselves to be of Hong Kong descent. The largest wave of immigration to Canada from Hong Kong occurred during the late 1980s and early 1990s, chiefly as the fear of uncertainties concerning the [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong]] in 1997.

The {{cn-span|text=vast majority{{how|date=July 2017}} of Canadians of Hong Kong origin are [[Han Chinese|ethnically Chinese]],|date=July 2017}} though some choose to eschew their "Chinese" identity.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wong|first1=Edward|last2=Wong|first2=Alan|title=Seeking Identity, ‘Hong Kong People’ Look to City, Not State|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/world/asia/hong-kong-people-looking-in-mirror-see-fading-chinese-identity.html?_r=0|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=Oct 7, 2014}}{{dubious|reason=Hong Kong is the state which they identified with.

As of 2014, Hong Kong has the highest concentration of Canadian citizens in Asia, with approximately 300,000 Canadian citizens of all ethnic backgrounds living in the city.&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keung|first1=Nicholas|title=Hong Kong: Asia's most Canadian city|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/02/24/hong_kong_asias_most_canadian_city.html|publisher=''The Toronto Star''|date=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the majority of Hong Kong Canadians reside in the metropolitan areas of Toronto and Vancouver.

==History==
The majority{{howmany|date=July 2017}} of Chinese Canadians migrated to Canada from the mid 1980s to 2000. However early settlement could be traced back to the early 19th Century when [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] became a British [[crown colony]], natives from Kwangtung (now Guangdong) escaped and settled in Hong Kong for a short while before migrating to North America.

In 1984, the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] was signed which largely shaped the future politics and economy of Hong Kong. The then British colony would become a [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China]]. Many people in Hong Kong at the time perceived a negative image of the China's government which was largely influenced by their experience with the illegal immigrants from the Canton province who smuggled into Hong Kong in the hope of finding freedom and better living standard than the lives ruled by the [[Chinese Communists]] {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

The fear of losing their freedom and prosperity under the China's government drove the Hong Kong citizens to despise their own Chinese identity. Their fear and worries were proved to be correct by the [[1989 Tiananmen Square Crackdown]] which later drove a large emigration wave to the anglophone world between 1980's to early 2000's. One of the most popular destination chosen by the immigrants was Canada, where thousands of Hongkongers settled in [[Greater Toronto]] and [[Metro Vancouver]].

==Numbers==
In 2006, among the 790,035 speakers of any of the [[varieties of Chinese]], 300,590 were speakers of [[Cantonese]].&lt;ref&gt;The 790,035 figure includes 300,590 persons listed as speaking Cantonese, 143,385 listed as speaking Mandarin, 4,580 listed as speaking Taiwanese, and 341,480 speaking other varieties or else simply filling out the relevant question on their census forms by noting "Chinese" without being more specific. See Statistics Canada, ''2006 Census Profile of Federal Electoral Districts (2003 Representation Order): Language, Mobility and Migration and Immigration and Citizenship.'' Ottawa, 2007, p. 8 and note no. 1 on p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2001 statistics, 44% of the Cantonese speakers were born in Hong Kong, 27% were born in Guangdong, the Chinese province where most{{howmany|date=July 2017}} Hongkongers have their ancestral roots, and 18% were Canadian-born.&lt;ref name="StatCan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chui|first1=Tina|last2=Tran|first2=Kelly|last3=Flanders|first3=John|format=PDF|url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/11-008-XIE/0040411-008-XIE.pdf|title=Chinese Canadians: Enriching the cultural mosaic|journal=Canadian Social Trends|publisher=[[Statistics Canada]]|date=Spring 2005|issue=76|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511230136/http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/11-008-XIE/0040411-008-XIE.pdf|archivedate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000s, some Canadian citizens from Hong Kong and their descendants have returned to Hong Kong for job opportunities. There are estimated to be as many as 300,000 [[Canadians in Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1016/1/1/6/101611635.html?coluid=7&amp;kindid=0&amp;docid=101611635&amp;mdate=0226122246|title=中國評論新聞：香港住了30萬加拿大人　成加國第16大城市|work=chinareviewnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, according to the Canadian Consulate General in Hong Kong, there are 500,000 people of Hong Kong descent in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/hong_kong/bilateral_relations_bilaterales/canada_hk.aspx?lang=eng&amp;menu_id=8&amp;menu=L|title=Canada-Hong Kong Relations|work=canadainternational.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hong Kong boasts one of the largest Canadian communities abroad (an estimated 295,000). This community, along with some 500,000 people of Hong Kong descent in Canada, plays a dynamic role in building vibrant bilateral relations between Canada and Hong Kong.

Canada's presence in Hong Kong is also reflected by the presence of Hong Kong-Canadian associations, such as the Chinese Canadian Association, established in 1989 and the Canadian University Association, which now acts as an umbrella group for some twenty Canadian university alumni associations active in Hong Kong today.

The '''House of Israel''' is a Jewish community located in Sefwi Wiawso in southwestern  [[Ghana]]. This group of people, of the Sefwi tribe, built a synagogue in 1998. Many of the men and children read English, but no one knows Hebrew.

==History of Jews in Ghana==
{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}
The people of Sefwi Wiawso trace a call for a "return" to normative Judaism by Aaron Ahomtre Toakyirafa, a community leader who, in 1976, is said to have had a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]]. In 2012, Gabrielle Zilkha, a Toronto-based filmmaker, visited Sefwe Wiawso to do research for a documentary about the House of Israel she is making. According to Zilkha, about 200 people--mostly children--live in the community. She states that the lack of a historical record makes it difficult to verify the groups claims, but that there is an oral tradition dating back 200 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishtribune.ca/features/2012/12/14/ghanas-house-of-israel-descendents-of-lost-tribes Shlomo Kasputin, "Ghana's House of Israel, descendents of lost tribes?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219025027/http://www.jewishtribune.ca/features/2012/12/14/ghanas-house-of-israel-descendents-of-lost-tribes |date=2012-12-19 }}, ''Jewish Tribune'', December 2012, accessed 22 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish facilities==
The leader of the House of Israel since 1993, David Ahenkorah received his own vision in taking up the mantle.&lt;ref name="west"/&gt; He has been granted a 40-acre plot of land to build a Jewish school for the community, but they have not yet been able to raise funds for construction. Children currently attend a local school, run by Christians. They built a synagogue in 1998 in New Adiembra, a Jewish neighborhood in Sefri Wiawso. Recently, they painted it blue and white, the colors of Israel.&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/2143/ |title=In West Africa, a Synagogue Where the Pavement Ends |work= Forward |publisher=Forward |date=2005-10-28 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several family compounds nearby and about 200 people belong to the synagogue.&lt;ref name="west"/&gt;

'''Ivanovism''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Ивановизм), also known by the name of the followers, the '''Ivanovites''' (Ивановцы), is a [[religion|religious]] movement in [[Russia]] based on the teachings of the [[mysticism|mystic]] [[Porfiry Ivanov]] and his "natural healing system".&lt;ref&gt;БалагушкинРНСР, 2002, с. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is classified as [[syncretism|syncretic]].&lt;ref&gt;Верейкина, 2004, с. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Central to the movement is the ''Detka'' (Детка) healing system&lt;ref&gt;Балагушкин, 2008, с. 475&lt;/ref&gt; and a "Hymn to Life" (Гимн жизни) focused on religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Балагушкин, 2008, с. 475&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Ryōmin'''|良民}} and {{Nihongo|'''Senmin'''|賤民}} were the two main castes of the [[classical Japan]] [[caste]] system. 

When the [[Ritsuryō]] legal system was starting to be enforced in Japan at the end of the 7th century, it included, as in [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] China, a division between those two major castes. The term '''Ryosensei''' (良賤制) describes the whole system. The '''Senmin''' caste, divided into five "genres", is also called '''Goshiki no Sen''' (五色の賤), the ''Senmin of five genres'', sometimes abbreviated to '''gosen''' (五賤).

Caste was part of the citizen registration enforced with the [[ritsuryō]].

==Ryōmin==
The Ryōmin (lit. ''Good citizens'') were the upper-class, divided into the four following subcastes{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}
*Kanjin (官人), government officials
*Kōmin (公民), citizens
*Shinabe (品部), professionals and tradesmen relevant to court functions
*Zakko (雑戸), tradesmen, especially those relevant to the military, considered of a lower class than the previous three

==Senmin==
The Senmin (lit. ''low citizens'') were the lower-class, divided into the five following subcastes:
*Ryōko (陵戸), dedicated to the imperial family or guards of imperial tombs
*Kanko (官戸), dedicated to public ministries
*Kenin (家人), servants of high-ranking families
*Kunuhi (公奴婢), slaves of the court
*Shinuhi (私奴婢), slaves of families

Intercaste wedding was at first not allowed.
Ryōko, Kanko and Kenin were allowed to have their own families.

The lowest two levels of citizens (''Nuhi'', [[slave]]s) could be sold or owned by Ryōmin citizens, and were not allowed to have a registered family. This caste system was not very rigid, in the sense that Kunuhi could become Kanko when they got older (66), and automatically freed at very old age (76), and Ryōmin could become Senmin (at the Kanko level) after having committed some crimes.

At first, children born between Ryōmin and Senmin would become Senmin. In 789, this changed and children born between Ryōmin and Senmin were Ryōmin.
The Senmin was a minority of the whole population.

The '''Lachi language''' (Chinese: '''Laji 拉基''', Vietnamese: '''La Chí'''; [[Endonym|autonym]] in China: ''{{IPA|li35 pu44 ljo44}}''; autonym in Vietnam: ''{{IPA|qu32 te453}}'', where ''{{IPA|qu32}}'' means "person") is a [[Kra language]] spoken in [[Yunnan]], [[China]] and in northern Vietnam. There were 9,500 [[Lachi people|Lachi]] speakers in Vietnam in 1990. Edmondson (2008) reports another 2,500 in [[Maguan County]], Yunnan, China for 1995, but Li Yunbing (2000) reports 60 speakers in Maguan out of an ethnic population of 1,600.

==Subdivisions==
Weera Ostapirat&lt;ref&gt;Ostapirat, Weera (2000). "[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/weera2000proto.pdf Proto-Kra]". ''Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area'' '''23''' (1): 1-251&lt;/ref&gt; proposed three major subdivisions for the Lachi language.

*'''Northern''' (Chinese or Flowery Lachi)
*'''Central''' (White Lachi)
*'''Southern''' (Long Haired and Black Lachi)

Jerold A. Edmondson notes that Vietnamese researchers recently have not been able to locate White (Central) Lachi speakers. It is also the least studied variety of Lachi.

The ''Maguan County Gazetteer'' 马关县志 (1996) lists the following Lachi ethnic subdivisions.
*Flowery Lachi 花拉基
*White Lachi 白拉基
*Black Lachi 黑拉基
*Chinese Lachi 汉拉基
*Manyou Lachi 曼忧拉基
*Manpeng Lachi 曼棚拉基

The ''Maguan County Gazetteer'' 马关县志 (1996) also lists the following autonyms for the Lachi.
*She 舍
*Laguo 拉果
*Heitu 黑土
*Gudai 古逮
*Yibi 依比
*Yimei 依梅
*Yiduo 依多
*Yibeng 依崩

The Republic of China-era ''Maguan County Gazetteer'' 马关县志 gives the names Labo 剌僰 (with a dog radical 犭for La 剌) and Laji 拉鸡.

==Geographic distribution==
Kosaka (2000) reports 6,000–8,000 Lachi speakers in Vietnam, and 2,000 in China. The Lachi of [[Maguan County]], China are currently classified as [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] (Li 2000), while the Lachi of [[Malipo County]], China, along with the Qabiao, are classified as [[Yi people|Yi]]. The Lachi of Vietnam have official status as a separate ethnic group.

===China===
The Lachi of China live in various locations in [[Maguan County]] (马关县), [[Yunnan]], which is located in [[Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture]] (文山壮族苗族自治州) near the border with [[Hà Giang Province]], Vietnam. According to American linguist Jerold A. Edmondson, the Lachi of China are thought to have moved to their present location during the [[Qing Dynasty]] from places in Vietnam called Maibu 麥布, Maidu 麥督, and Maiha 麥哈.&lt;ref name="TK"&gt;Diller, Anthony, Jerold A. Edmondson, and Yongxian Luo ed. The Tai–Kadai Languages. Routledge Language Family Series. Psychology Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Lachis are also found scattered in Yanshan, Qiubei, Xichou, and Malipo counties.

The subdivisions, with their respective locations, are as follows:

'''Flowery Lachi''' ([[exonym and endonym|autonym]]: ''li35 pu44 ljo44 n̩44 tɕo55'')
*Jinchang Township 金厂镇
**Zhongzhai 中寨&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=28476&lt;/ref&gt;
**Sanjiajie 三家街&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=28475&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chinese Lachi''' ([[exonym and endonym|autonym]]: ''li35 pu44 tɕo44'')
*Jiahanqing Township 夹寒箐乡
**Niulongshan 牛龙山&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=44806&lt;/ref&gt;
**Dujiaozhai 独脚寨&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=44805&lt;/ref&gt;
**Shi'er Daohe 十二道河&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=44746&lt;/ref&gt;
**Laozhai 老寨&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=44822&lt;/ref&gt;
*Renhe Township 仁和镇
**Baishiyan 白石岩&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=193071&lt;/ref&gt;
**Shiqiao 石桥&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=193137&lt;/ref&gt;
**Huomuqing 火木箐&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=193086&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pocket Lachi''' ([[exonym and endonym|autonym]]: ''li35 pu44 te35'')
*Nanlao Township 南捞乡: Busu 布苏&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=244495&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=244496&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Red Lachi''' ([[exonym and endonym|autonym]]: ''li33 pu44 ke55'')
*Xiaobazi Township 小坝子镇
**Tianpeng 田棚&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vindex.aspx?departmentid=122124&lt;/ref&gt;
**Laqie 拉劫 / Laqi 拉气&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=122152&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
The Lachi live mostly in [[Xín Mần District]] and [[Hoàng Su Phì District]], [[Hà Giang Province]], [[Vietnam]]. There are also many Lachi living in [[Bắc Quang District]] in southern [[Hà Giang Province]], which is outside their home district of [[Hoàng Su Phì]]. Since the Lachi dialects of Vietnam have many Chinese loanwords, the Lachi of Vietnam must have migrated from areas to the north in China (Kosaka 2000). Similarly, the Lachi of [[Maguan County]], Yunnan, China just across the border believed that their ancestors had migrated from Ami Prefecture 阿迷州, which is now [[Kaiyuan, Yunnan]].&lt;ref name="Edmondson2003"/&gt; In Vietnam, [[Jerold Edmondson]] notes that the most common autonym used by his Lachi informants is ''qu31 te341'', with ''qu31'' meaning 'people' (from [[Proto-Kra language|Proto-Kra]] *khra&lt;sup&gt;C1&lt;/sup&gt; 'people').&lt;ref name="Edmondson2003"&gt;Edmondson, Jerold A. and Shaoni Li. 2003. "[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/edmondson2003review.pdf Review of ''Lajiyu Yanjiu'' by Li Yunbing]." In Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area, 26 , no. 1: 163-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lachi people are an officially recognized ethnic group in Vietnam, and are divided as such (Kosaka 2000, Edmondson 2008):

'''Long Haired Lachi''' ([[exonym and endonym|autonym]]: ''li35 pu44 tjoŋ44'')
*Bản Phùng, Hoàng Su Phì District &amp;mdash; largest village; regarded as cradle site

'''Black Lachi''' ([[exonym and endonym|autonym]]: ''li35 pu44 pi55'')
*Bản Díu, [[Xín Mần District|Xín Mần]] &amp;mdash; speakers have shifted to the [[Nung people|Nùng language]]

'''White Lachi''' ([[exonym and endonym|autonym]]: ''li35 pu44 pu55''; language possibly extinct)
*Bản Pắng, Hoàng Su Phì District &amp;mdash; speakers have shifted to the [[Nung people|Nùng language]], the regional lingua franca
*Bản Máy, Hoàng Su Phì District &amp;mdash; speakers have shifted to the [[Nung people|Nùng language]], the regional lingua franca

Lachi is also spoken in (Kosaka 2000):
*Tân Lợi hamlet (Thôn Tân Lợi), [[Bắc Quang District]], [[Hà Giang Province]] &amp;mdash; formed through a secondary migration from Tân Lập village (Xã Tân Lập), which is now called Xã Tân Thành.
*Chí Cà, [[Xín Mần District]], [[Hà Giang Province]]
*[[Bắc Hà District]], [[Lào Cai Province]] &amp;mdash; descended from Bản Phùng migrants; can no longer speak Lachi (e.g., in Thôn Núng Choáng, Xã Nàm Sán)
*[[Mường Khương District]], [[Lào Cai Province]] &amp;mdash; descended from Bản Phùng migrants; can no longer speak Lachi

Kosaka (2000) describes the following migratory route that took the Lachi of Bản Phùng, Hoàng Su Phì District to other locations, all in [[Bắc Quang District]], [[Hà Giang Province]].
#Bản Phùng, Hoàng Su Phì District
#Xã Tân Lập (now called Xã Tân Thành)
#Xã Yên Bình
#Xã Vĩ Thượng
#Xã Xuân Giang (later divided into two parts, including Nà Khương, which has the higher concentration of Lachi people)

The ''Maguan County Gazetteer'' 马关县志 (1996) lists the following locations in Vietnam with ethnic Lachi.
*Manyou 曼忧
*Manpeng 曼棚
*Manban 曼班
*Manmei 曼美
*Jiga 鸡嘎
*Hualong 花隆
*Mengkang 猛康

==Grammar==
Like other [[Kra languages]] such as [[Gelao language|Gelao]] and [[Buyang language|Buyang]], Lachi displays clause-final negation (Li 2000).

'''Land use''' involves the management and modification of [[natural environment]] or [[wilderness]] into [[built environment]] such as [[Human settlement|settlements]] and semi-natural habitats such as [[Arable land|arable fields]], [[pasture]]s, and managed [[Woodland|woods]]. It also has been defined as "the total of arrangements, activities, and inputs that people undertake in a certain [[land cover]] type."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/land_use/045.htm IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change And Forestry, 2.2.1.1 Land Use]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
[[Image:Europe land use map.png|thumb|400px|A land use map of [[Europe]]—major non-natural land uses include arable farmland (yellow) and pasture (light green).]]

Land Use practices vary considerably across the world. The [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] Water Development Division explains that "Land use concerns the products and/or benefits obtained from use of the land as well as the land management actions (activities) carried out by humans to produce those products and benefits."&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090808100750/http://www.fao.org/landandwater/agll/landuse/landusedef.stm FAO Land and Water Division] retrieved 14 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  As of the early 1990s, about 13% of the [[Earth]] was considered arable land, with 26% in pasture, 32% forests and woodland, and 1.5% urban areas.

As Albert Guttenberg (1959) wrote many years ago, "'Land use' is a key term in the language of [[city planning]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a787389941~frm=titlelink JAPA 25:3]&lt;/ref&gt;  Commonly, political [[jurisdiction]]s will undertake [[land-use planning]] and regulate the use of land in an attempt to avoid [[land-use conflict]]s.  Land use plans are implemented through land division and use ordinances and regulations, such as [[zoning regulations]].  [[Management consulting]] firms and [[non-governmental organizations]] will frequently seek to influence these regulations before they are codified.

=== United States ===

In colonial America, few regulations existed to control the use of land, due to the seemingly endless amounts of it. As society shifted from rural to urban, public land regulation became important, especially to city governments trying to control industry, commerce, and housing within their boundaries. The first zoning ordinance was passed in [[New York City]] in 1916,&lt;ref&gt;[[Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nolon, John R., [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1505003 Local Land Use Control in New York: An Aging Citadel Under Siege] (July/Aug. 1992). New York State Bar Journal, p. 38, July–August 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and, by the 1930s, most states had adopted [[zoning]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zoning]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, concerns about the environment and historic preservation led to further regulation.

Today, federal, state, and local governments regulate growth and [[land development|development]] through [[statutory law]]. The majority of controls on land, however, stem from the actions of private developers and individuals. Three typical situations bringing such private entities into the court system are: suits brought by one neighbor against another; suits brought by a public official against a neighboring landowner on behalf of the public; and suits involving individuals who share ownership of a particular parcel of land. In these situations, judicial decisions and enforcement of private land-use arrangements can reinforce public regulation, and achieve forms and levels of control that regulatory zoning cannot.

Two major federal laws have been passed in the last half century that limit the use of land significantly. These are the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]] (today embodied in 16 U.S.C. 461 et seq.) and the [[National Environmental Policy Act of 1969]] (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).

The [[United States Department of Agriculture|US Department of Agriculture]] has identified six major types of land use in the US. Acreage statistics for each type of land use in the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous 48 states]] in 2017 were as follows:

* [[Pasture]]/[[Rangeland|range]]: 654 M 
* [[Forest]]: 538.6 M
* [[Agricultural land|Cropland]]: 391.5 M
* Special use: 168.8 M
* Miscellaneous: 68.9 M
* [[Urban area|Urban]]: 69.4 M &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/|title=Here's How America Uses Its Land|last=Merrill|first=Dave|date=July 31, 2018|work=Bloomberg|access-date=2018-08-05|last2=Leatherby|first2=Lauren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environment ==
Land use and [[land management]] practices have a major impact on [[natural resources]] including [[water]], [[soil]], [[nutrient]]s, [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ameztegui|first1=Aitor|last2=Coll|first2=Lluis|last3=Brotons|first3=Lluis|last4=Ninot|first4=JM|title=Land-use legacies rather than climate change are driving the recent upward shift of the mountain tree line in the Pyrenees.|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|date=2016|doi=10.1111/geb.12407|url=http://arxiudigital.ctfc.cat/docs/upload/27_520_Ameztegui_et_al-Global_Ecology_and_Biogeography.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land use information can be used to develop solutions for natural resource management issues such as salinity and [[water quality]]. For instance, water bodies in a region that has been [[deforested]] or having erosion will have different water quality than those in areas that are [[forest]]ed. [[Forest gardening]], a plant-based food production system, is believed to be the oldest form of land use in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forest Gardening|author=Robert Hart|year=1996|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N01940btQAQC&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=Forest gardening, in the sense of finding uses for and attempting to control the growth of wild plants, is undoubtedly the oldest form of land use in the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major effect of land use on [[land cover]] since 1750 has been [[deforestation]] of [[temperate region]]s.{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter2.pdf Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]&lt;/ref&gt; More recent significant effects of land use include [[urban sprawl]], [[soil erosion]], [[soil degradation]], [[Soil salinity|salinization]], and [[desertification]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/ENVIRONMENT/envpdf/landdatafinal.pdf UN Land Degradation and Land Use/Cover Data Sources] ret. 26 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Land-use change, together with use of [[fossil fuel]]s, are the major [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] sources of carbon dioxide, a dominant [[greenhouse gas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM2feb07.pdf UN Report on Climate Change] retrieved 25 June 2007 from Web archive [https://web.archive.org/web/19960101/http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM2feb07.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by the [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], land degradation has been exacerbated where there has been an absence of any land use planning, or of its orderly execution, or the existence of financial or legal incentives that have led to the wrong land use decisions, or one-sided central planning leading to over-utilization of the land resources - for instance for immediate production at all costs. As a consequence the result has often been misery for large segments of the local population and destruction of valuable [[ecosystem]]s. Such narrow approaches should be replaced by a technique for the planning and management of land resources that is integrated and holistic and where land users are central. This will ensure the long-term quality of the land for human use, the prevention or resolution of social conflicts related to land use, and the conservation of [[ecosystems]] of high [[biodiversity]] value.

{{wide image|Kastellet_cph.jpg|933px|The [[citadel]] of [[Kastellet, Copenhagen]] that has been converted into a park, showing multiple examples of [[suburban]] land use}}

== Urban growth boundaries ==

The [[urban growth boundary]] is one form of land-use regulation. For example, [[Portland, Oregon]] is required to have an urban growth boundary which contains at least {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} of vacant land. Additionally, Oregon restricts the development of farmland. The regulations are controversial, but an economic analysis concluded that farmland appreciated similarly to the other land.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeker WG, Plantinga AJ (2007).

'''Litvishe''' is a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] word, that refers to [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] [[Jews]], who are not [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] (and not [[Hardal]]im or [[Sephardic Haredim]]). The [[Hebrew]] form which is used with the same meaning is '''Lita'im'''. Other expressions are [[Yeshivish]]e and [[Misnagdim]].

Both the words Litvishe and Lita'im are somewhat misleading, because there are also Hasidic Jews from [[Lithuania]], and lots of [[Lithuanian Jews]] who are not Haredim. The reference to Lithuania does not refer to the country of that name today, but to the historic [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], which also included all of modern-day Belarus and also parts of Ukraine. The term Misnagdim ("opponents"), on the other hand, is somewhat outdated, because the opposition between the two groups has lost much of its relevance.

'''Marvin Eugene Wolfgang''' (14 November 1924 in [[Millersburg, Pennsylvania]] – 12 April 1998 in [[Philadelphia]]) was an American [[sociologist]] and [[criminologist]].

Wolfgang was a soldier in World War II and participated in the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]]. After the war he studied at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where his principal teacher was [[Thorsten Sellin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Anatomy of Violence|last = Raine|first = Adrian|publisher = Pantheon Books|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-307-37884-2|location = New York, USA|pages = xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Penn, Wolfgang took his MA (1950) and PhD (1955) in sociology/criminology. Until his death in 1998 he was a professor of criminology at the University of Pennsylvania.

In 1964, he published ''[[The Measurement of Delinquency]]'', which was the first study of the true impact of crime on society. Three years later, he completed ''[[The Subculture of Violence: Towards an Integrated Theory in Criminology]]'', which focused on high rates of violence among blacks and the influence of a black subculture.

Wolfgang wrote over 30 books and 150 articles throughout his life. His most famous work, ''[[Delinquency in a Birth Cohort]]'', was published in 1972. This book marked the beginning of large-scale studies of crime and delinquency. It was a study of over 10,000 boys born in Philadelphia in 1945. The purpose was "to determine which members of the cohort had official contacts with the police, to compare delinquents with nondelinquents, and to trace the volume, frequency and character of delinquent careers up to age 18." The data revealed that of 9,945 boys, 3,475 had at least one recorded police incident. Other statistics showed that offender rates increased gradually from ages 7 to 11, increased rapidly from 11 to 16, and declined at age 17. The study concluded that a small number of offenders account for most of the offenses committed. It also stated that "the juvenile justice system has been able to screen the hard core offenders fairly well, but it has been unable to restrain, discourage, or cure delinquency."

Wolfgang won many awards, including the Hans Von Hentig Award from the World Society of Victimology in 1988, the Edwin Sutherland Award from the American Society of Criminology in 1989, the Beccaria Gold Medal from the German, Austrian, and Swiss Society of Criminology in 1997; in 1993, the Wolfgang Criminology Award was established in his name.

Wolfgang spent the later years of his life showing his opposition to issues such as the death penalty and the use of a gun against a perpetrator in articles such as "We Do Not Deserve to Kill" and ''[[A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed]].'' (at http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6854&amp;context=jclc)  in which he says he does not like their conclusions that having a gun for self-defense "can be useful," but cannot fault their methodology.

""What troubles me is the article by Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz. ["Armed Resistance to Crime: The Prevalence and Nature of Self-Defense with a Gun," by Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz, published in that same issue of The Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology] The reason I am troubled is that '''they have provided an almost clear cut case of methodologically sound research in support of''' something I have theoretically opposed for years, namely, '''the use of a gun in defense against a criminal perpetrator'''. ...I have to admit my admiration for the care and caution expressed in this article and this research. Can it be true that about two million instances occur each year in which a gun was used as a defensive measure against crime? It is hard to believe. Yet, it is hard to challenge the data collected. We do not have contrary evidence. '''The National Crime Victim Survey does not directly contravene this latest survey''', nor do the Mauser and Hart Studies. ... '''the methodological soundness of the current Kleck and Gertz study is clear'''. I cannot further debate it. ... The Kleck and Gertz study impresses me for the caution the authors exercise and the elaborate nuances they examine methodologically. I do not like their conclusions that having a gun can be useful, but '''I cannot fault their methodology. They have tried earnestly to meet all objections in advance and have done exceedingly well'''."

His career was cut short by pancreatic cancer, and he died on 12 April 1998. The British Journal of Criminology stated he was "the most influential criminologist in the English-speaking world."

[[File:2009ko_Maskaradak_Barkoxen.jpg|thumb|2009 maskarada in Barkoxe]]
The '''maskarada''' {{IPA-eu|mas̺ˈkaɾada|}} is a popular set of traditional, theatrical performances that take place annually during the time of [[carnival]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] region of [[Soule]], [[France]] (''Zuberoa'' in the [[Basque language]]). It is generally referred to in the plural (''maskaradak'') as it is repeated across the region on the streets of [[village]]s (one day per village) over the span of a month or two in late winter through spring.
The plays are performed by the villages' (usually younger) inhabitants, and the arrangements for each maskarada are the responsibility of each participating village. Sometimes, when two villages are very small, they will share the duties together.

Though naturally the actors change from year to year, a friendly air of informality, formed of deep familiarity pervades throughout. The Maskaradak follow variations on very traditional themes that make use of time-honoured sets and age-old, immutable characters. A motley parade of musicians ([[atabal (Basque instrument)|atabal]], [[psalterium (instrument)|ttun-ttun]] and [[xirula]] players), traditional dancers and assorted actors, villagers and visitors walk merrily along a route that meanders up and down the village's streets.

At particular points of the parade, the ''barrikadak'' take place, where the marchers stop in front of a stall put there by the villagers, and bestow on them a dance, sometimes even a song, this in exchange for snacks (biscuits, crisps, and the like), and refreshments (wine and liquor), which is then shared with bystanders. The process is repeated over and over, perhaps lasting all day, from early in the morning till afternoon (with a popular lunch somewhere in the middle), until the end of the final performance at the parade terminus - usually the village market place or [[Basque pelota]] court.

Maskaradas represent a genuine example of traditional popular carnival theatre struggling to survive, much in step with the modest revival of the Basque language. It's connected to [[Pastoral (theatre of Soule)|pastoral]] in many aspects, such as recurrent fixed characters, a marked distinction in the group (e.g. the reds stand for the good, while the blacks represent the evil)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.euskonews.com/0335zbk/gaia33501fr.html | title = De l’hiver au printemps : Les carnavals traditionnels dans les Pyrénées.

The language used by the actors remains bilingual [[Zuberoan]] [[Basque language|Basque]], for the most part, and [[Gascon language|Bearnais]], despite some difficulties to hand either language over to new generations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5983">The '''Maui solar telescope protests''' are a series of protests and demonstrations attempting to block the construction of the [[Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope]] on the summit of [[Haleakalā]] on [[Maui, Hawaii]].

==Background==
Beginning in 1958, telescopes began to be built atop Maui's Haleakalā summit becoming the [[Haleakala Observatory|Haleakalā High Altitude Observatory Site]], owned and managed by the [[University of Hawaii]]. In 2010 the [[Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources]] issued a permit for the construction, but that permit was revoked because it was granted before a required contested case hearing. Two hearings had to be held because the hearing officer of the first meeting was disqualified for ex parte communications with representatives of [[Daniel Inouye]]. The second meeting resulted in the new hearing officer recommending the permits. Groundbreaking took place in 2012. Construction was well underway even with a lawsuit to the Hawaii Supreme court. During an appeal of the second permit, one of the justices was concerned about the disconnect between an environmental impact study that showed a major impact, and the board's decision that there would be no substantial impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Tanigawa|first= Noe|date= |title= Haleakalā: A History of Telescopes|url= http://hpr2.org/post/haleakal-history-telescopes|work= Hawaii Public radio|location= |access-date= 2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015 protests==

In June 2015 protesters blockaded the baseyard at the foot of the mountain that served as a staging area for construction. They succeeded in turning back the convoy delivery. They attempted the delivery again in late July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Loomis|first= Ilima|date= |title= How the world’s largest solar telescope rose on Maui while nearby protests derailed a larger scope|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/how-world-s-largest-solar-telescope-rose-maui-while-nearby-protests-derailed-larger|work= Science|location= |access-date= 2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early morning of July 31, 2015 activists, protesters and demonstrators showed up to block the Maui Baseyard. Aware that protesters were planning a demonstration, Maui police put out a statement saying: "Maui Police Department respects the rights for people to demonstrate peacefully," and, "We will respond in an appropriate manner." Protesters lay on the ground attached to PVC pipe and chains in an attempt to stop the construction of the telescope. Police arrested 20 people ranging in age from 19 to 60. One of those arrested was a Hawaiian Studies professor at the University of Hawaii, Maui, Kaleikoa Ka‘eo, who stated, "Fundamentally, we are asserting our human rights". Activist Trinette Furtado was not arrested but said, "We are not anti-telescope, we are not anti-science... We are for the mountain, we are for preserving our culture. We stand for the conservation, desecration, archaeological and Hawaiian access laws which protect Haleakala."

On August 19, 2015 approximately 150 protesters attempted to block the convoy of construction trucks from its baseyard. Eight people were arrested when they refused to move from the roadway. Once past the first group of protesters, the convoy was again blocked at Haleakalā Crater road with debris scattered on the roadway. Police in full riot gear carried protesters away. Among those arrested was Joshua Lanakila Mangauil, a leader of the [[Thirty Meter Telescope protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Kelleher|first= Jennifer Sinco|date= August 20, 2015|title= Police: 8 arrested during Maui solar telescope protests|url= http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-police-8-arrested-during-maui-solar-telescope-2015aug20-story.html|work= Associated Press|location= Honolulu|access-date= 2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Memons in South Africa''' form a prosperous [[Muslim]] subgroup in that country's [[Indians in South Africa|Indian]] community and are largely descended from [[Kathiawadi Memon|Memons from Kathiawar]] who immigrated from [[Undivided India|India]] in the late 19th century/early 20th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Villages and towns that South African Memons originated from include [[Porbander]], [[Bhanvad]], [[Ranavav]] and [[Jodiya]].

Memons played a major role in the promotion of [[Islam in South Africa]], and there have been rivalries for the management of local mosques between Memons and [[Surti Muslims|Surtis]], who are Gujarati-speaking Sunni Muslims.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} This is primarily due to the different 'Maslak' (path) [[Deobandi]] mainly Surti, and [[Barelvi]] mainly Memon, although these are far less prominent than they were in the past.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Although the [[Memoni language]] is not widely spoken by younger Memons in South Africa, South African Memons continue to maintain a strong (although slowly eroding) Memon identity. Already, few younger Memons are aware of the towns where their ancestors came from.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Although the early Memons practiced [[endogamy]] (marrying within their social group, including ancestral village), intermarriage between Memon groups and other [[Sunni Muslims]] is now widely accepted, mirroring a similar integration among Gujarati Hindu groups from Surat and Shauarashtra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kendra.org.za/samachar/Samachar%20Edition%2020_MAIL.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807033709/http://kendra.org.za/samachar/Samachar%20Edition%2020_MAIL.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Memon organisations in South Africa include the [[Memon Association of South Africa]] (formerly the 'Memon Association of the Transvaal'), the [http://www.samemonfoundation.org Southern African Memon Foundation] and the [[Natal Memon Jamaat]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.memon.com/html/events/fimc/ARMoti.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5276">'''Musawah''' ('equality'; in [[Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|مساواة}}) is a global [[Social movement|movement]] for equality and justice in the Muslim family, led by [[feminists]] "seeking to reclaim [[Islam]] and the [[Koran]] for themselves".&lt;ref name="Nation"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thenation.com/article/rise-islamic-feminists/ | title=The Rise of the Islamic Feminists | date=4 December 2013 | agency=The Nation thenation.com | accessdate=7 June 2016 | author=Segran, Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/musawah/ | title=Schott's Vocab: Musawah | date=24 February 2009 | agency=The New York Times | accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Twelve women met in [[Istanbul]] as the planning committee in March 2007, from countries around the world: [[Egypt]], [[the Gambia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iran]], [[Malaysia]], [[Morocco]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Qatar]], [[Turkey]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | title=Gender and Equality in Muslim Family Law: Justice and Ethics in the Islamic Legal Tradition | publisher=I.B.Tauris &amp; Co Ltd ibtauris.com | author=Larsen, Lena, Mir-Hosseini, Ziba, Moe, Christian, Vogt, Kari | year=2013 | isbn=9781848859227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musawah was officially launched in [[Kuala Lampur]] in February 2009, at a meeting of 250 Muslim activists, scholars, legal practitioners and policy-makers from 47 countries.&lt;ref name="Nation" /&gt; [[Mona Eltahawy]], the Egyptian-American journalist and Musawah member, commented on this founding moment: "Panel discussions and dinner talk [...] were heated, but not about headscarves or education. We had much heavier issues on our minds — like a woman’s right to initiate divorce, how to protect women against clerics who say Islam gives a husband the right to beat his wife, fighting forced marriage. In other words, wrestling Islam back from the men who use it against us."&lt;ref name="Mona"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mona-eltahawy/headscarves-and-hymens_b_216236.html | title=Headscarves and Hymens | date=17 July 2009 | agency=The Huffington Post huffingtonpost.com | accessdate=11 June 2016 | author=Eltahawy, Mona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Musawah" comes from an [[Arabic]] word that translates as "equality".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3hpAgAAQBAJ|title=Islamic Law and International Human Rights Law|last=Emon|first=Anver M.|last2=Ellis|first2=Mark|last3=Glahn|first3=Benjamin|date=2012-10-11|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191645693|page=309|language=en|chapter=Ch. 17: Musawah, CEDAW, and Muslim Family Laws in the 21st Century}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Focus ==
Musawah's advocacy draws from four primary sources:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.musawah.org/about-musawah|title=About Musawah|website=Musawah|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Islamic teachings;
* universal human rights;
* national constitutional guarantees of equality; and 
* "the lived realities of women and men".
In practice, this has translated into advocacy around issues such as reforming divorce laws in Muslim countries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tools used by Musawah to advance this goal have included research into the differences between traditional Muslim family laws and the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], publication of books on [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], and toolkits for advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dea9AAAAQBAJ|title=Do Muslim Women Need Saving?|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Lila|date=2013-11-12|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674726338|page=179|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Role And Challenges==
One of Musawah's co-founders, Malaysian activist [[Zainah Anwar]], offered this perspective on Musawah's role in the broader [[women's rights|women's]] and [[human rights]] [[social movements|movements]]: "What Musawah brings to the table is a rich and diverse collection of interpretations, juristic opinions and principles that makes it possible to read equality and justice in Islam, and construe these twin values at national and international levels. It is a vital contribution at a time when democracy, human rights and women's rights constitute the modern ethical paradigm of today's world."&lt;ref name="NYTZA"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/opinion/05iht-edanwar.1.20613399.html | title=Bearers of change | date=5 March 2009 | agency=The New York Times nytimes.com | accessdate=11 June 2016 | author=Anwar, Zainah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenges in Musawah's work include ongoing debates around the multiple interpretations of the Koran, and the defence of a human rights interpretation from within Islam, rather than a [[secular]] [[human rights]] framework.&lt;ref name="Nation" /&gt;

The '''Rangrez''' is a [[Muslim]] community in [[North India]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three by K S Singh page 1211 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of '''Muslim Rangrez''' community have migrated to [[Pakistan]] after independence and have settled in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]].

==History and origin==

The word ''rangrez'' (رنگریز) means a dyer in the [[Persian language|Persian]] language, and the community has been connected with this occupation, but in present circumstances its members are involved in different trades and other business activities. Many now claim [[Central Asia]]n descent, and it is quite possible that only some may be of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ancestry. They perceive themselves  a [[Shaikh]] status but in actually they are a student and bc Hindu converts and they are genetically not as Caucasian as upper caste muslims.  They may be converts from the [[Hindu]] [[Rangrez]] [[caste]], [[Rajputs]] or it is more likely that they are a community of foreign origin, who over time have evolved into a community which is now bound by rules of [[endogamy]]&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three by K S Singh page 1201 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt; They are now associated with the printing of clothes.
But ranrezz of India don't have same dna intermixing as pathans and seyeds do, it means they are mid caste Hindu converts and they have nothing to do with muslim rajpoots, mewati or kayamkhani.even their skin tone and facial features are austaloid type.
They have the three subdivision, the '''Lalgarh''', '''Nilgarh''' and [[Muslim Chhipi|Chhipi]], and speak [[Urdu]], as well as local dialects of [[Hindi]]. The basis of these social divisions is occupation. In this social hierarchy, the [[Muslim Chhipi|Chhipi]] are placed in the lowest position, because they dyed and printed clothes, whereas the Lalgarh and Nilgarh generally prepare colour from indigo. In fact, the [[Muslim Chhipi|Chhipi]] form a distinct endogamous sub-group within the larger Rangrez community. The word Rangrez has now been replaced by the word Sabbagh, which is an [[Arabic]] word meaning garden. They are a [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]] community. They also visit the shrines of various [[Sufi]] saints found in [[North India]], such as Khwaja [[Moinuddin Chishti]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three by K S Singh page 1204 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==

The Rangrez are found in the states of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Delhi]] and [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three by K S Singh page 1041 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;nowiki/&gt;There are many Rangrez organisations such as All India Rangrez Jagran Manch running in India with Mr. Rangrez Mustaquim Akhtar,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/mustaquimrangrez&lt;/ref&gt; a social worker as its national president. Contact  information for Mr. Rangrez Mustaquim Akhtar are: Address: Near street no. 11, Main Road, Nagmatia Colony, Gaya Town, state: Bihar, INDIA. Phone number: +919931413550. Another organisation is the Kul Hind Anjuman Sabbagh being an all India organisation of Rangrez with its headquarters at [[Delhi]].
Quite a few Rangrez have immigrated to [[Pakistan]], where they form an important element in the [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajir]] community.

==Present circumstances==

=== In Uttar Pradesh ===

In [[Uttar Pradesh]], they are a landless community, involved in textiles and printing. Many have given up their traditional occupation, and recent surveys show only ten percent are still involved in their traditional occupation. Many have now adopted different other occupation Rangrez specially in Rohilkhand Region are substanstially land owner and involve in different types of trade. In Pilibhit District Tehsil Puranpur where Rangrez have sizeable population and are well to do rangrez also have sizable population in Bareilly district. Tehsil baheri have good no. of population where its member are Businessman. They live in multi-caste and multi-religious villages, but occupy their own distinct quarters. Most speak [[Urdu language|Urdu]], as well as local dialects of [[Hindi]], such as [[Awadhi]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three by K S Singh page 1042 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rangrez have their own council of elders to deal with matters relating to the community. This caste council or [[panchayat]] deals with issues such as elopement, fights, thefts and disrespect of community norms. The caste council has an elected president, secretary and treasurer, and no longer operates as a traditional caste council. They are an endogamous community, and cross cousin and parallel cousin marriages are prevalent. Traditionally marriages take place between the Lalgarh and Nilgarh sub-groups, but not with the [[Muslim Chhipi]]. These three sub-groups are further divided into ''biradaris'', clans which claim descent from a common ancestor. Marriages are preferred within the biradaris. Important biradaris include the [[Saiyed]], [[Chipa]], [[Chandelwal]], [[Ghosi]], [[Siddiqi]], [[Usmani]], [[Shaikh]] and [[Khatri]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three by K S Singh page 1205 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Rajasthan ===

In [[Rajasthan]], the community claim to have come from [[Delhi]] during the rule of [[Mohammad Ghori]]. Tge actual rangrez are false claiming about their heritage by claiming afghan or rajpoot.They are just converts from obc or brahamin converts.  They are found mainly in [[Alwar]], [[Jaipur]], [[Sikar]] and Sawai Madhopur districts. The community is sub-divided into several clans, known as [[gotra]]s, the main ones being [[Ghilji|Khilji]], [[Chauhan]],  Bagadiya, Tuglaq [[Singhania (disambiguation)|Singhania]], [[Gori (clan)|Gori]], [[Solanki]], Aarbi, Salampariya and Sabuka, jajodia. Even muslim rajpoot and original pathan don't treat them as  equal status to them. They maintain a system of clan exogamy, which a practice unique to the Rajasthan Rangrez. They want to  marry into other castes like [[Qureshi]], [[Muslim Rajputs]], [[Shaikh]] and [[Pathan]but they are genetically a more dravidian race abd convert from obc and some brahamins .
 kayamkhani , mewati and pathans try all possible ways to avoid marriages from these people . Indeed Rangrez are the people who don't to marry to their own women and just want to marry upper caste muslims  for escaping their dalit or dravidian heritage or brahamin or artisan  Hindu heritage . This type of scenario made them one 
Of the Lowest people in mentality and they don't consider their women to marry them. The Rangrez are involved mainly involved in the trading and printing of clothes. Like in [[Uttar Pradesh]], the [[Rajasthan]] Rangrez live in multi-caste and multi-religious villages, but maintain a social distance with neighbouring [[Muslim]] [[caste]]s such as the [[Meo]] and [[Manihar]].,&lt;ref&gt;People of India Rajasthan Volume XXXVIII Part Two edited by B.K Lavania, D. K Samanta, S K Mandal  &amp; N.N Vyas pages 709 to 712 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;  Behlim Rangrez is oldest gotra in [[Behlim]] in India. They came with Mahmood ghaznavi in his Indian campaign. Maximum Behaleem rangrez migrated for Pakistan during Independence (1947).

==Early years==
[[File:Namık Kemal-7.2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Namık Kemal (on the right) with his friend Hikmet]]
An [[Albanians|Albanian]] by origin,&lt;ref&gt;Metin Heper, ''The State and Kurds in Turkey: The Question of Assimilation'', Springer (2007), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Namık Kemal was born in [[Tekirdağ]] (then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], today in [[Turkey]]) on 21 December 1840, to Fatma Zehra and Mustafa Asım Bey, the latter of whom was chief astrologer in the [[Ottoman sultan|Sultan]]’s Palace.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-417"/&gt; Since surnames or family names were not in use during the Ottoman Empire, "Kemal" was not his surname, but part of his first name. During his youth, Kemal traveled throughout the Ottoman Empire, staying in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], [[Kars]], and [[Sofia]], and studied a number of subjects, including poetry.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-417"/&gt; In 1857, at the age of 17, Kemal worked in the ''Tercüme Odası'' ("The Translation Office") of the government.&lt;ref name="ShawShaw1977-130"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanford J. Shaw|authorlink1=Stanford J. Shaw|author2=Ezel Kural Shaw|authorlink2=Ezel Kural Shaw|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIET_7ji7YAC&amp;pg=PA520|volume=2|year=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-29166-8|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a result of the political nature of his writings, Kemal was forced to leave this job by [[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire|Grand Vizier]] [[Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha]] and so joined his friend and fellow [[Young Ottomans|Young Ottoman]], [[İbrahim Şinasi]], on his newspaper ''Tasvir-i Efkar'' ("Herald of Ideas").&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-417"/&gt; Kemal worked on ''Tasvir-i Efkar'' until his exile and flight to [[Paris]] in 1867.&lt;ref name="ShawShaw1977-130"/&gt;

==Political career==

=== Young Ottomans===
The [[Young Ottomans]] were a group of political activists whose members came principally from the young elite of Ottoman society.&lt;ref name="ShawShaw1977-70-71"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanford J. Shaw|authorlink1=Stanford J.

After joining the Young Ottomans in 1862, Kemal continually wrote essays on the subjects of political, administrative, social, and foreign policy reform.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-418"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gábor Ágoston|author2=Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7|page=418}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShawShaw1977-131"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanford J.

[[Namik Kemal]] admired the constitution of the [[French Third Republic]], he summed up the Young Ottomans' political ideals as "the sovereignty of the nation, the separation of powers, the responsibility of officials, personal freedom, equality, freedom of thought, freedom of press, freedom of association, enjoyment of property, sanctity of the home".&lt;ref name="BergerMiller"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Stefan|last2=Miller|first2=Alexei|title=Nationalizing Empires|date=2015|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=9633860164|page=447|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__9fCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA447|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BlackEdinburgh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Antony|title=The History of Islamic Political Thought: From the Prophet to the Present|date=2011|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=0748688781|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hd1vAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA286|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Hanioğlu, 104"&gt;Hanioğlu, M.

==Ideology and exile==
[[File:Namık Kemal-2.jpg|thumb|185px|right|An old photograph of Namık Kemal]]
Namık Kemal was heavily influenced by Western conceptions of the relationship between the government and the people.&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-504-505"/&gt; As such, he and his compatriots spoke out against the movement to centralize the government being undertaken by Sultan [[Abdülaziz]] (ruled 1861–1876), and his advisors [[Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha]] and [[Mehmed Fuad Pasha]].&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-5"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gábor Ágoston|author2=Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his criticism of the government, Namık Kemal was exiled from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1867 and fled to [[Paris]], where many other exiled [[Young Ottomans]] had found refuge.&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-506"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|authorlink=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|title=Ottoman Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BhLOtjYtiPoC|date=1 August 1979|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-688-08093-8|page=506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869 or 1870, Kemal was allowed to return to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and proceeded to write for a number of Young Ottoman-run newspapers, and eventually published one of his own, ''Ibret'' ("Admonition"), in which he addressed more intellectual, social, and national subjects.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-418"/&gt; In addition, it was after his return to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] that Kemal wrote his most significant and influential work: the play ''Vatan Yahut Silistre'', or ''Silistra'', which translates to "Fatherland."&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-418"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-506"/&gt; The play tells the story of an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] soldier whose loyalty to his nation, and not his religion or allegiance to the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]], motivates him to defend the town of [[Silistra]], [[Bulgaria]] from the [[Russian Empire|Russians]] during the [[Crimean War]].&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-418"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-507"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|authorlink=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|title=Ottoman Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BhLOtjYtiPoC|date=1 August 1979|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-688-08093-8|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact these nationalist sentiments, unheard of in the [[Ottoman Empire]] prior to Kemal, had on the [[Turkish people]] was so profound that Kemal’s newspaper, ''Ibret'', was shut down, and Kemal himself was banished from the Empire for the second time.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-418"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-507"/&gt; During this second exile, Kemal took refuge in [[Cyprus]], in a building known as the [[Namık Kemal Dungeon]] in [[Famagusta]], where he remained for three years.&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-507"/&gt;

===Later career===
[[File:Namik kemal2.jpg|thumb|185px|Namık Kemal was one of the leading figures in creating a national identity]]
Like many [[Young Ottomans]], Namık Kemal supported [[Murad V]]’s ascension to the throne after the abdication of [[Abdülaziz]] in 1876.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-514"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|authorlink=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|title=Ottoman Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BhLOtjYtiPoC|date=1 August 1979|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-688-08093-8|page=514}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their hope that Murad would institute the reforms they desired was dashed, for it rapidly became apparent that he was not suited for rule; his weak nerves and alcoholism leading to his abdication after only three months.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-404"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gábor Ágoston|author2=Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7|page=404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Namık Kemal protested against [[Murad V|Murad]]’s deposition, and continued to support Murad’s Western political perspectives, but ultimately, his pleas failed to have any effect and [[Murad V]] stepped down in 1876.&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-515"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|authorlink=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|title=Ottoman Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BhLOtjYtiPoC|date=1 August 1979|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-688-08093-8|page=515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Murad’s abdication, the first Ottoman Parliament, the [[General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire]], was established in 1876, largely as a result of pressure from the [[Young Ottomans]], as well as [[Midhat Pasha]]’s political influence.&lt;ref name="ShawShaw1977-181-182"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanford J. Shaw|authorlink1=Stanford J. Shaw|author2=Ezel Kural Shaw|authorlink2=Ezel Kural Shaw|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIET_7ji7YAC&amp;pg=PA520|volume=2|year=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-29166-8|pages=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while, at first, [[Abdul Hamid II]], the sultan who succeeded [[Murad V]], was willing to allow Parliament to function, he quickly decided that it was easier for him to enact reform by seizing autocratic powers instead of waiting for the approval of elected officials.&lt;ref name="ShawShaw1977-212"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanford J. Shaw|authorlink1=Stanford J. Shaw|author2=Ezel Kural Shaw|authorlink2=Ezel Kural Shaw|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIET_7ji7YAC&amp;pg=PA520|volume=2|year=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-29166-8|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to successfully implement his autocratic rule, Abdul Hamid II exiled many [[Young Ottomans]], including Namık Kemal, who were critical of his decision to disregard the Parliament.&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-530"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|authorlink=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|title=Ottoman Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BhLOtjYtiPoC|date=1 August 1979|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-688-08093-8|page=530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for the third time, Kemal was removed from [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] by being forced into an administrative position in [[Chios]], where he would die in 1888.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-418"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-530"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShawShaw1977-212-213"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanford J.

==Legacy==
Namık Kemal had an enormous influence on the formation of a [[Turkish nationalism|Turkish national identity]].&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-418"/&gt; Kemal’s focus on national loyalty, rather than loyalty to a monarch, influenced, as it was, by Western European ideals of self-government, contributed not only to the spread of democracy during the early 20th century, but also to the formation of the modern [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] after the dissolution of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="ShawShaw1977-260-261"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanford J. Shaw|authorlink1=Stanford J. Shaw|author2=Ezel Kural Shaw|authorlink2=Ezel Kural Shaw|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIET_7ji7YAC&amp;pg=PA520|volume=2|year=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-29166-8|pages=260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of modern Turkey, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], often remarked that he had been influenced by Kemal’s writing as a young man, and that they had subsequently been a source of inspiration for his goals in the formation of the Turkish government and state.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-48"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gábor Ágoston|author2=Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area continues to be the gateway for legal work for the nearby villages. {{As of|2012}} the area has been categorized in 20 wards circle headed by ward member of that area selected by the residents of the ward.

==Economy==

Following the construction of the [[Ganges Canal (Rajasthan)]], the main occupation of near by villages is agriculture, which is also the basis of the city's economy. . The main crops are wheat, mustard and cotton while other crops includes guar, bajra, sugar cane and grams. In recent years, [[kinnow]] (a hybrid citrus fruit derived from the "orange") has also gained prominence with farmers. The industries in the city are mostly based on agriculture. The people of the town are involved in their family businesses.

This city is based out of a agricultural area but has also been home to liqour Barron Ghanshyam Dass Sharma who also set up a distillery in Kanpur Uttar Pradesh and was famously known as the wine king.
He also had great influence on the politics of the area and political parties always took in his consideration before taking any decisions.
He was also seen as a saviour and Robinhood by the locals , he along with his business partner who was more like a brother to him, Gurmeet Singh Kooner for years he distributed free flour to the poor and made sure no poor in his area slept hungry. Every day thousands of tonnes of wheat was processed in his mill and the costs incurred were very high but still he continued this distribution system for years until some negative externalities disrupted this philanthropic work.
Along with this he made sure that money was never a barrier in attaining education.
 
He not only paid for the underprivileged's school fees but provided with school dresses and books as well and later on went on to set up one of the largest school and college of Sri Ganganagar Gurmeet Singh Ghanshyam Das college located in 25 BB .
 
Not just a philanthropist but Mr.Sharma was also a very smart businessman with liquor vends in whole of Uttar Pradesh with distribution of alcohol in almost every district of Rajasthan .
He was the richest person to live in his district at a time ,he built this humongous empire with his brother like friend Gurmeet Singh Kooner.
 
He was there for the people when the government fell deaf ears and he helped the public in all ways he could would distribute sweets to the poor on all celebrations and also helped a lot of people in marrying of their daughters by giving them large sums of money charitably and buttermilk distribution was done on all days to the poor.
 
He never made a point to let out his charitable works and was thus never discussed about on a national level and loved the poor as his own and he also helped a lot of upcoming entrepreneurs by giving out large amounts of money and never took it back , he said that this was his part for the society .
It was this nature of him due to which all the people in the state loved him and respected him a lot.
He died on 22 March 2018 due to complications related to a cancer removal surgery in Mumbai after which his mortal remains were transported by a Private Plane to his home back in Padampur,Rajasthan.
 
The area and the whole state of Rajasthan greived this loss and it was a major loss for the people of his area as he was a father figure to many and a person who lived life on Morales and justice . Several politicians , beaurecrats and over 8000 people attended his death ceremony and he left behind 2 daughters and a son.

==Terminology and definition==
South African statutory law does not define a "farm attack" as a specific crime. Rather, the term is used to refer to a number of different crimes committed against persons specifically on commercial farms or smallholdings.

According to the South African Police Service National Operational Co-ordinating Committee: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Attacks on farms and smallholdings refer to acts aimed at the person of residents, workers and visitors to farms and smallholdings, whether with the intent to murder, rape, rob or inflict bodily harm. In addition, all actions aimed at disrupting farming activities as a commercial concern, whether for motives related to ideology, labour disputes, land issues, revenge, grievances, intimidation, should be included.&lt;ref name="Committee"&gt;{{cite web |title=Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Farm Attacks |date=31 July 2003 |url=http://www.saps.gov.za/statistics/reports/farmattacks/farmattacks_2003.htm |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition excludes "social fabric crimes", that is those crimes committed by members of the farming community on one another, such as domestic or workplace violence, and focuses on outsiders entering the farms to commit specific criminal acts. Dina Pule, the safety and security [[Member of the Executive Council]] (MEC) for [[Mpumalanga Province]], has disagreed with this definition and has said that "farm attacks" included only those cases "where farm residents were murdered, and not cases of robberies or attempted murders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nkosana |last=ka Makaula |url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_2005223,00.html |title=Farm attack is 'only if fatal' |date=28 September 2006 |website=News24 |accessdate=9 October 2006 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416192327/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_2005223,00.html |archivedate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch has criticised the use of the term "farm attacks", which they regard as "suggesting a terrorist or military purpose", which they do not believe is the primary motivation for most farm attacks.&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{cite book |first=Bronwen |last=Manby |title=Unequal Protection – The State Response to Violent Crime on South African Farms |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=August 2001 |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/safrica2/ |accessdate=28 October 2006 |isbn=1-56432-263-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2001/safrica2/Safarms1.htm |title=Unequal Protection: The State Response to Violent Crime on South African Farms - Summary |first=Patrick |last=Minges |website=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible motives==
{{see|Crime in South Africa}}
The South African government believes the chief motive for attacks is robbery.&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/2044340/in-the-wake-of-attacks-against-immigrants-south-african-farmers-and-white-genocide-forgotten/ |title=In The Wake of Attacks Against Immigrants, South African Farmers And White Genocide Forgotten |last1=Jarrett |first1=Jinger |date=26 April 2015 |website=[[Inquisitr]] |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is shared by Afrikaner rights group Afriforum, which does not believe that there is a racial motive associated with most attacks.&lt;ref name="702burgerafriforumworkers"/&gt; A Committee of Inquiry into Farm Attacks was appointed in 2001 by the National Commissioner of Police. The purpose of the committee was to "inquire into the ongoing spate of attacks on farms, which include violent criminal acts such as murder, robbery, rape, to determine the motives and factors behind these attacks and to make recommendations on their findings".&lt;ref name="Committee" /&gt; Monetary theft occurred in most of the attacks,&lt;ref name="Committee" /&gt; firearms were stolen in 23.0%,&lt;ref name="Committee" /&gt; and 16.0% of farm attacks involved vehicular thefts.&lt;ref name="Committee" /&gt; The committee noted that "there is a common misconception that in a large proportion of farm attacks little is stolen"&lt;ref name="Committee" /&gt; and "various items are stolen in by far the greater majority of cases, and, in those cases where nothing is taken, there is almost always a logical explanation, such as that the attackers had to leave quickly because help arrived."&lt;ref name="Committee" /&gt;

The [[Natives' Land Act]], adopted in 1913, awarded the ownership of 87 percent of land to South Africans of European descent.

==Criticism of response==
Gideon Meiring, chairperson of the [[Transvaal Agricultural Union]]'s safety and security committee, criticised the South African Police Service for failing to prevent farm attacks, stating that the police "are not part of the solution but part of the bloody problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sheena |last=Adams |title=Farmer armies in the killing fields |website=IOL News |date=23 September 2006 |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/farmer-armies-in-the-killing-fields-294873 |accessdate=27 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meiring has assisted farming communities in setting up private armed patrols in their area. Kallie Kriel of [[AfriForum]] accused politicians, including Agriculture Minister [[Lulu Xingwana]] and her deputy [[Dirk du Toit]], of inciting hatred against farmers, saying "Those who inflame hate and aggression towards farmers have to be regarded as accomplices to the murders of farmers." In particular, Kriel condemned claims that violence against farm workers by farmers was endemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gcina |last=Ntsaluba |title=Anti-Farmer hate speech slated |website=News24 |date=29 April 2008 |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Anti-farmer-hate-speech-slated-20080429 |accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johan Burger of the [[Institute for Security Studies]] has said that the government's dismantling of the [[commando system]] had created a vacuum which the current rural safety plan was not addressing adequately. Although no reason was given for phasing out the system, observers believed that the government did so due to suspicions that the commandos were aligned to right-wing groups. Critics have said this is incorrect, as the system included both black South Africans as well as whites as troops.&lt;ref name="iolJB" /&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] has described a general trend of escalation in "farm attacks" since 1994, and noted a lack of government response to them. The HRW study however found the failures of the government response to be in its inadequacies to protect black farm residents. "In practice, however, the plan has significantly increased insecurity for black residents of and visitors to commercial farming areas, as they have become the targets of sometimes indiscriminate "anti-crime" initiatives... In addition, the rural protection plan has largely failed to respond to crime committed against black farm residents, in particular crime committed by white farm owners."&lt;ref name="HRW" /&gt;

==Prevention==
While the police are supposed to regularly visit commercial farms to ensure security, they say they cannot provide effective protection due to the wide areas that need to be covered and a lack of funding. 'Farmwatch' groups have been formed with the intention of filling this protection gap. These groups use radio to coordinate mutual assistance between farmers, local [[South African Commando System|Commando volunteers]], and [[private security companies]]. The particular mix of groups that operate has varied by area, with wealthier farmers being more likely to employ private security firms. The police and these groups are linked together as part of the Rural Protection Plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.transformation.und.ac.za/index.php/transformation/article/view/857/672 |first=Bronwen |last=Manby |title=A Failure of Rural Protection |journal=Transformation |year=2002 |issue=49 |pages=92–94 |doi=10.1353/trn.2003.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt; created in 1997 by President [[Nelson Mandela]].&lt;ref name="nyet"/&gt;

In 2003 the government began disbanding commando units, saying they had been "part of the apartheid state's security apparatus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irinnews.org/InDepthMain.aspx?InDepthId=31&amp;ReportId=70551&amp;Country=Yes |title=In-depth: Civilian Protection in Armed Conflict |date=3 March 2003 |website=[[IRIN]] |access-date=15 August 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111143704/http://www.irinnews.org/InDepthMain.aspx?InDepthId=31&amp;ReportId=70551&amp;Country=Yes |archive-date=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study from the [[University of the Free State]] concluded that this disbanding compromised rural security, as police have prioritized South Africa's urban crime problems.&lt;ref name="ancesc"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chitja |first1=Twala |first2=Marietjie |last2=Oelofse |date=2013 |title=Rural Safety and the Disbandment of the Commando Units in South Africa: A Challenge to Rural Communities and the African National Congress (ANC)? |url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/T%20&amp;%20T/T%20&amp;%20T-11-0-000-13-Web/T%20&amp;%20T-11-1-000-13-ABST-PDF/S-T&amp;T-11-1-025-13-301-Twala-C/S-T&amp;T-11-1-025-13-301-Twala-C-Tt.pdf |journal=Stud Tribes Tribals |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=25–33 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spike in violent attacks on farmers in February 2017 led to one of the country's largest [[prayer meeting]]s being held on 22–23 April 2017 in [[Bloemfontein]], attracting over 1,000,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.biznews.com/interviews/2017/04/25/graham-power-million-plus-prayer-meeting/ |title=Graham Power: How plea to stop farm murders sparked SA's million-plus prayer meeting |date=24 April 2017 |website=BizNews.com |access-date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the murder of [[Klapmuts]] farmer Joubert Conradie in October 2017, a protest convoy was organised on 30 October 2017. Known as #BlackMonday the convoy ran from Stellenbosch to Cape Town and attracted an estimated 10,000 protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/blackmonday-city-swamped-by-more-protesters-than-planned-11781146 |title=#BlackMonday: City swamped by more protesters than planned |last=Adriaanse |first=Dominic |date=31 October 2017 |website=IOL News |access-date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest convoy was criticised by the South African Police Service for disrupting traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://ewn.co.za/2017/10/31/police-ministry-criticises-blackmonday-protests |title=Police Ministry criticises #BlackMonday protests |last=Lindeque |first=Mia |date=31 October 2017 |website=Eye Witness News |access-date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest convoy was also criticised by the [[African National Congress]] and the EFF for the display by some protesters of the apartheid era South African flag and alleged that the protesters were only concerned about the death of white farmers and did not include black members of the farming community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://ewn.co.za/2017/10/31/anc-condemns-display-of-old-sa-flags-during-blackmonday-protest |title=ANC condemns display of old SA flags during #BlackMonday protest |last=Magwedze |first=Hitekani |date=31 October 2017 |website=Eye Witness News |access-date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2017-10-31-blackmonday-promoted-anti-black-racism-eff/#.Wfh2m2iCyUk |title=#BlackMonday promoted anti-black racism - EFF |date=31 October 2017 |website=Daily Maverick |access-date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These photos were later confirmed to have been used out of context and inappropriately linked to the protests by Nickolaus Bauer, a reporter from [[eNCA]].

===United States===
In August 2018, [[Fox News]] host [[Tucker Carlson]] commented that the South African government had disproportionately targeted white farmers during its ongoing [[Land reform in South Africa|land reform efforts]] due to anti-white racism.

'''Tamahaq''' (''Tahaggart Tamahaq'', ''Tamahaq Tahaggart'') is the only known [[Tuareg languages|Northern Tuareg language]], spoken in [[Algeria]], western [[Libya]] and northern [[Niger]]. It varies little from the Southern Tuareg [[Berber languages]] of the [[Aïr Mountains]], [[Azawagh]] and [[Kel Adagh|Adagh]]. The differences mostly consist of sound substitutions, such as ''Tamahaq'' instead of ''Tamajaq'' or ''Tamasheq''.

==Varieties==
There are three main varieties of Tamahaq:
*''Tahaggart'', spoken around the [[Ahaggar Mountains]] in southern Algeria by the [[Kel Ahaggar]] confederation
*''Ajjer'', spoken by the [[Kel Ajjer]] confederation
*''Ghat'', spoken around [[Djanet]] in southeast Algeria and [[Ghat, Libya|Ghat]] in Libya.

According to Blench (2006), Tahaggart and Ghat are distinct Tuareg languages.

{{Use American English|date=October 2017}}

[[File:Feminine Hygiene Products in a Walmart.png|thumb|Feminine hygiene products are subject to tax in a number of countries]]
A '''tampon tax''' is a popular term used to call attention to the fact that [[tampons]]—and other [[feminine hygiene]] products—are subject to [[value-added tax]], unlike the [[tax exemption]] status granted to other products considered basic necessities. Proponents of tax exemption argue that tampons, [[sanitary napkins]], [[menstrual cups]] and comparable products constitute basic, unavoidable necessities for women and thus should be made tax exempt.

Proponents argue that feminine hygiene products serving the basic menstrual cycle should be classified alongside other unavoidable, [[tax exempt]] necessities, such as groceries and personal medical items.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt; The [[BBC]] estimates that women—half of the global population—need to use [[feminine hygiene]] products for about a week each month for about 30 years.&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt; While [[sales tax]] policy varies across jurisdictions, these products were typically taxed at the same rate as non-essential goods, such as in the United States, while other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, reduced or eliminated their general [[consumption tax]] on sanitary products.&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt; When asked about equivalent exemptions for men, proponents argue that no male products, [[condoms]] included, are comparable to feminine hygiene products, since menstruation is biological and "[[feminine hygiene]] is not a choice".&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; As the vast majority of consumers of feminine hygiene products are women, the increased cost has been criticized as being discriminatory against women.&lt;ref name="Hinckley Journal of Politics:Public Discourse of Policies Concerning Menstrual Taboo"/&gt; The tampon tax is not a special tax levied directly on feminine hygiene products.&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt;

After the tax in Canada was removed mid-2015, women began protesting in other countries later that year.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; On July 21, 2018, India eliminated the Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 12% from sanitary napkins.

== Tax law by jurisdiction ==

* In Australia, after an 18-year campaign the 10 per cent tax on tampons and pads will be removed after states and territories agreed to make sanitary products exempt from the GST which will see the tax removed by January 1, 2019.&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt;
* Canada removed its tampon tax in mid-2015 following an online petition signed by thousands.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt;

* Ireland levies no value-added tax on tampons, panty liners, and sanitary towels. While other European Union countries are barred from creating zero-rated value added, Ireland's exemptions are [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]].&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt;
* Slovakia levies a 20% tax on sanitary products—the basic goods rate. A Slovakian film director commented that there are no plans to change the law and that east Europe missed elements of feminist change while living under communist government.&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
The United Kingdom has levied a [[value-added tax (United Kingdom)|value-added tax]] on sanitary products since it joined the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973. This rate was reduced to 5% specifically for sanitary products in 2000 with lobbying from [[Member of Parliament]] [[Dawn Primarolo]] saying that this reduction was "about fairness, and doing what we can to lower the cost of a necessity."&lt;ref name="theweek: UK News"/&gt; This is the lowest rate possible under the [[European Union]]'s [[European Union value added tax|value added tax law]], which as of 2015 does not allow zero rates. The [[UK Independence Party]] raised the issue in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]] with promises to withdraw from the European Union and allow the zero rate. Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] commented, when prompted, that the tampon tax campaign was "long-standing" and a complicated issue within the European Union.&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt; In England, one in ten women between 14 and 21 cannot afford menstrual management products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plan-uk.org/media-centre/plan-international-uks-research-on-period-poverty-and-stigma|title=Plan International UK's Research on Period Poverty and Stigma|last=|first=|date=December 20, 2017|website=Plan International UK|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/one-in-10-young-women-struggle-to-afford-pads-and-tampons-a8008671.html|title=Period Poverty: Why One in 10 Young Women Struggle to Afford Pads and Tampons|last=Rowlingson|first=Karen|date=October 21, 2017|website=The Independent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laura Coryton]] led a "Stop taxing periods, period" campaign with an online petition to have the European Union remove the value-added tax for sanitary products.&lt;ref name="Coryton"/&gt; [[George Osborne]] mentioned the petition by name in his 2015 [[Autumn Statement]] pledge to end the tampon tax at the European Union level. The petition platform's CEO cited the campaign as an example of successful [[clicktivism]],&lt;ref name="Clicktivism"/&gt; with over 320,000 signatures.&lt;ref name="BBC: wiki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ind_student"/&gt; In March 2016, Parliament created legislation to eliminate the tampon VAT.&lt;ref name="BBC: wiki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ind_Cameron"/&gt; It was expected to go into effect by April 2018 but did not do so; several British women protested for it publicly while displaying blood stains from their periods.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; On the 3rd October 2018, new EU VAT rules that will allow the UK to stop taxing sanitary products were approved by the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mobarik: UK one step closer to ending the tampon tax |url= http://conservativeeurope.com/news/mobarik-uk-a-step-closer-to-ending-the-tampon-tax|work=Conservatives in the European Parliament|date=3 October 2018|author=Nosheena Mobarik }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
In July 2017, a pilot program began in Scotland to have free sanitary products available at schools and food banks for women who cannot afford them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.scot/publications/access-sanitary-products-aberdeen-pilot-evaluation-report/pages/2/|title=Access to sanitary products Aberdeen pilot: evaluation report - gov.scot|website=www.gov.scot|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot scheme was launched for six months in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], with £42,500 of funding from the devolved [[Scottish Government]] in order to address the growing scandal of "period poverty". It was believed 1,000 girls would benefit from the scheme, as there were reports of teenage girls using tissues, toilet roll, torn T-shirts and even newspaper as makeshift sanitary products, with some girls even skipping school altogether. It was decided to launch the scheme to improve attainment and school attendance, as well as improve confidence amongst teenage girls during their period; and Scotland is believed to be the first country in the world to give out free sanitary products as part of a government-sponsored initiative.

Further to this half year pilot program, Scotland's opposition Labour Party intends to introduce a bill to make this permanent. Scotland is the first country to ban period poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-hampshire-43148080/period-poverty-helping-homeless-and-vulnerable-women |title=Period poverty: Helping homeless and vulnerable women - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2018-02-26 |accessdate=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by the WHO and UNICEF showed that one out of five women in Scotland have been forced to improvise with items including toilet paper and old clothes due to the high cost of commercial products.

In the United States, almost all states tax "tangible individual property" but exempt non-luxury "necessities": groceries, [[medical prescription|prescriptions]], [[prosthetics]], agriculture supplies, and sometimes clothes—the exemptions vary between states.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; Five states do not have a state sales tax (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon), and {{As of|2018|11|lc=yes}}, ten states specifically exempted essential hygiene products (Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, and Pennsylvania).&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://splinternews.com/these-are-the-u-s-states-that-tax-women-for-having-per-1793848102|title=These are the U.S. states that tax women for having periods|last=Hillin|first=Taryn|work=Splinter|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ktnv.com/news/national/democracy-2018/election-results-2018-nevada-ballot-questions-1-6|title=Election Results 2018: Nevada Ballot Questions 1-6|work=KNTV|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., most states charge sales tax for women's pads and tampons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/18/scotland-end-period-poverty-tampon-tax/502020002/|title=Women get their periods every month — and it's incredibly expensive|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten states have dropped the tampon tax — Minnesota, Illinois, Nevada, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut and Florida, according to NPR and CNN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Diaz |first=Andrea |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/07/health/nevada-tampon-tax-repealed-trnd/index.html |title=Nevada becomes the 10th state to eliminate 'pink tax' on menstrual products |publisher=CNN |date=2015-09-01 |accessdate=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven other states have introduced such legislation, most recently Nebraska, Virginia and Arizona. In January 2018, California rejected a proposal to eliminate tampon tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/18/scotland-end-period-poverty-tampon-tax/502020002/|title=Women get their periods every month — and it's incredibly expensive|work=USA TODAY|accessdate=2 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many federal assistance programs such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and WIC (Women, Infants and Children) don’t allow the use of an EBT for products such as pads or tampons despite the products' classification as medical devices.  The IRS does not classify female products as medical devices, thus blocking women from buying them with pre-tax dollars in both flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2018/08/14/lack-feminine-hygiene-products-keeps-girls-out-school/948313002/|title=Teen girls are missing school because they don't have access to feminine hygiene products|work=The Tennessean|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some changes to the tampon taxes but most of these changes are state level or by city. On a smaller scale, individual cities have also changed their laws in favor of eliminating the tampon tax. 

==== California ====
California Assemblywoman [[Cristina Garcia (politician)|Cristina Garcia]] reported that California women each pay roughly [[US$]]7 per month over 40 years, constituting US$20 million in annual taxes. Garcia and [[Ling Ling Chang]] proposed a bill to remove the tampon tax in early 2016. At this period, only a handful of the country's states exempted tampons, and several others had no state sales tax. Garcia held that women were taxed "for being women" and bore an economic burden for having no other choice but to buy these products. Garcia and Chang added that the tax was "regulatory discrimination" that disproportionately affected poor women and women of color, and that it likely persisted due to [[taboo|social taboos]] against discussing menstruation.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; Both houses of the [[California State Legislature]] voted to exempt tampons from taxation in June 2016,&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt; but the bill was vetoed by the state's governor, [[Jerry Brown]], three months later.&lt;ref name="Reuters: Cali veto"/&gt;

California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed AB-1561 due to the potential loss of money in taxing feminine hygiene products. In response, Cristina Garcia co-authored AB-0479: Common Cents Tax Reform Act with Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, which is a new measure outlining a solution to offset the feminine product and diaper tax exemption by increasing the tax on hard liquor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/13/theres-no-happy-hour-for-menstruation-tax-liquor-instead-of-tampons-lawmakers-say/?utm_term=.f1b7dfe6354e|title='There's no happy hour for menstruation': Tax liquor instead of tampons, lawmakers say|last=Phillips|first=Kristine|date=March 13, 2017|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, California State Legislature passed AB 10 requiring public middle schools and high schools where at least 40% of students meet the federal poverty level to stock half of the restrooms with free tampons and sanitary napkins. The law was passed in an effort to eliminate the cost burden and keep low-income students in schools during their menstrual cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB10|title=Bill Text  - AB-10 Feminine hygiene products: public school restrooms.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/TA/AC/PL/tier1.asp|title=Tier I Schools - Persistently Lowest-Achieving Schools (CA Dept of Education)|website=www.cde.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies involved in supplying the necessary feminine hygiene products (tampons and pads) for complete menstrual care in the restrooms of schools include WAXIE and Hospeco. They also supply various options for menstrual product dispensers that have a time delay mechanism to prevent products from being overused and/or abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.waxie.com/ab10-menstrual-care|title=AB10 Menstrual Care {{!}} Waxie Sanitary Supply|last=Supply|first=WAXIE Sanitary|website=info.waxie.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hospeco.com/assets/user/documents/HSC_school_rules_L-HSC-0113-S_online.pdf|title=Do you know the new school rules?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hospeco.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New York ====
In July 2016, New York State exempted feminine hygiene products from taxation, reducing the state's tax revenue by an estimated US$10 million annually.&lt;ref name="USAT: NY" /&gt; Connecticut and Illinois also removed their tax in 2016, with Florida following suit in 2017.&lt;ref name="BBC_Why" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huff_Florida" /&gt;

==== New Jersey ====
A 2018 empirical study on New Jersey's 2005 tax break on menstrual products found that "repealing tampon taxes removes an unequal tax burden and could make menstrual hygiene products more accessible for low-income consumers."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cotropia|first=Christopher Anthony|last2=Rozema|first2=Kyle|date=2017|title=Who Would Benefit from Repealing Tampon Taxes? Empirical Evidence from New Jersey|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2999970|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|language=en|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2999970|issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study utilized data from more than 16,000 purchases in 2004-2006 made in New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, using these latter nearby states as the control group. Through a differences-in-differences approach, they found that after the repeal, consumer prices on menstrual products decreased by 7.3%, relative to the control states. This was greater than the 6.9% sales tax, suggesting that the consumers benefitted from the tax break. Upon further analysis, the study also found that the decrease in consumer prices was greater for low-income consumers than high-income consumers (3.9% decrease versus 12.4% decrease).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This suggests that low-income consumers received the most benefit from the tax break, while high-income consumers shared the benefit with producers of menstrual products.

== Activism ==
Supporters of the exemption of said taxes are calling their efforts "menstrual equity", explaining it as a social movement that strives for feminine products like tampons to be considered necessities. Things that are considered necessities, for example toilet paper, are not taxed. Activists are often being led by members of government. Councilwomen Julissa Ferreras-Copeland led a movement with a tampon tax pilot project ultimately providing free pads and tampons at a local high school in Queens, New York. Ferreras-Copeland's effort has now been expanded into 25 different schools around New York City. Other democrats including Ydanis Rodriguez and council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito are advocating for state legislature to stop taxing sanitary products. 

Free the Tampon, an advocate for free menstrual products estimates that it would cost less than $5 a year per user to provide tampons and pads in restrooms at schools and businesses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/new-york-city-bill-to-call-for-free-tampons-in-public-restrooms-shelters-and-jails/|title=New York City Bill to Call for Free Tampons in Public School Restrooms, Shelters and Jails|last=Rabin|first=Roni Caryn|work=Well|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Frankenstein Project''' is a contemporary sculpture by [[Tony Stallard]], located on the [[Blackpool]] Promenade in [[Lancashire]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/archive/arts/blackpool.shtml|title=BBC - Radio4 - Today/Happy Birthday Bob|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was permanently installed in 2001, and consists of a divers decompression chamber. Inside the chamber is a blue neon light which illuminates the skeletons and [[killer whale]] skull inside the chamber.&lt;ref name="bpgazette"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/will-new-prom-art-be-monster-hit-or-miss-1-398435|title=Will new Prom art be monster hit or miss?|website=www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
The Frankenstein Project was executed as part of a four-part art scheme commissioned by Blackpool Council and a number of other art companies at a cost of £500,000, under the name of the Great Promenade Show. Implementation of the piece took six years in total and was Stallard's biggest project to date. Weighing seven tonnes, the piece consists of twenty-four foot long gas tank, donated by [[British Gas]], with a replica killer whale inside. Portholes on the side of the tank allow visitors to peer inside the illuminated tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/5490208.Brentwood__Harold_Wood__He_s_Frankenstein_s_maker_/?ref=arc|title=Brentwood, Harold Wood: He's Frankenstein's maker!|website=Gazette|language=en|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Stallard acknowledged that the piece would invite debate&lt;ref name="bpgazette" /&gt; and the piece did indeed draw the most varied critical response. Despite being one of four new features on the promenade, The Frankenstein Project received most reaction.&lt;ref name="lanctelegraph"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/5863223.Turns_ugly_for_Frankenstein/|title=Turns ugly for Frankenstein|website=Lancashire Telegraph|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the sculpture was the victim of persistent vandal attacks which required significant repairs and eventually caused the site of the artwork to be redeveloped and moved back to its location.&lt;ref name="lanctelegraph" /&gt;

Like [[chastity]], the concept of virginity has traditionally involved [[sexual abstinence]]. The concept of virginity usually involves [[sexual morality|moral]] or religious issues and can have consequences in terms of social status and in [[interpersonal relationship]]s.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"&gt;See here [https://books.google.com/books?id=6qNCeI2AcY4C&amp;pg=PT11&amp;lpg=PT11] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=pXXZn_qSoDoC&amp;pg=PA48 pages 47–49] for views on what constitutes virginity loss and therefore sexual intercourse or other sexual activity; source discusses male virginity, how gay and lesbian individuals define virginity loss, and how the majority of researchers and heterosexuals define virginity loss/"technical virginity" by whether or not a person has engaged in penile-vaginal sex. {{Cite book|author=Laura M.

==Etymology==
The word ''virgin'' comes via [[Old French]] ''virgine'' from the [[root (linguistics)|root]] form of Latin {{lang|la|[[wikt:virgo|virgo]]}}, [[Genitive case|genitive]] {{lang|la|virginis}}, meaning literally "maiden" or "[[almah|virgin]]"&lt;ref&gt;Charlton T. Lewis and Charles Short, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2351070&amp;redirect=true 'virgo'], in ''[[A Latin Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;—a sexually intact young woman or "sexually inexperienced woman". As in Latin, the English word is also often used with wider reference, by relaxing the age, [[gender]] or sexual criteria.&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/virgin 'virgin'] in ''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, more-mature women can be virgins ([[Elizabeth I of England|The Virgin Queen]]), men can be virgins, and potential initiates into many fields can be colloquially termed ''virgins''; for example, a skydiving "virgin". In the latter usage, ''virgin'' means uninitiated.

The Latin word likely arose by analogy with a suit of [[lexeme]]s based on {{lang|la|vireo}}, meaning "to be green, fresh or flourishing", mostly with [[Botany|botanic]] reference—in particular, {{lang|la|virga}} meaning "strip of wood".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=virgin 'Virgin'], ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known use of ''virgin'' in English is found in a [[Middle English]] manuscript held at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] of about 1200:

{{quote|Ðar haueð ... martirs, and confessors, and '''uirgines''' maked faier bode inne to women.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of illuminated Anglo-Saxon manuscripts|Trinity College Homilies]]'' 185 [ms B.15.34 (369)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this, and many later contexts, the reference is specifically [[Christian]], alluding to members of the Ordo Virginum (Order of Virgins), which applies to the [[consecrated virgin]]s known to have existed since the early church from the writings of the [[Church Fathers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p4.htm 'Consecrated virgins and widows',] ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' 922–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

By about 1300, the word was expanded to apply also to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], the mother of [[Jesus]], hence to sexual virginity explicitly:

{{quote|Conceiud o þe hali gast, born o þe '''virgine''' marie.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cursor Mundi]]'' 24977&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Further expansion of the word to include virtuous (or naïve) young women, irrespective of religious connection, occurred over about another century, until by about 1400 we find:

{{quote|Voide &amp; vacand of vices as '''virgyns''' it ware.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Alexander Romance|The Wars of Alexander]]'' 4665&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These are three of the eighteen definitions of ''virgin'' from the first edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED1'', pages 230–232). Most of the ''OED1'' definitions, however, are similar.

The [[German language|German]] word for "virgin" is ''[[wikt:Jungfrau|Jungfrau]]''. ''Jungfrau'' literally means "young woman", but is not used in this sense, anymore. Instead "junge Frau" can be used. ''Jungfrau'' is the word reserved specifically for sexual inexperience. As ''[[wikt:Frau|Frau]]'' means "woman", it suggests a female referent. Unlike English, German also has a specific word for a male virgin ''[[wikt:Jüngling|Jüngling]]'' ''(Youngling)''. It is, however, dated and rarely used. ''Jungfrau'', with some masculine modifier, is more typical, as evidenced by the film ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'', about a 40-year-old male virgin, titled in German, "Jungfrau (40), männlich, sucht…".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405422/releaseinfo Release dates for ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;  German also distinguishes between young women and [[girl]]s, who are denoted by the word ''[[wikt:Mädchen|Mädchen]]''. The English [[cognate]] "maid" was often used to imply virginity, especially in poetry - e.g. [[Maid Marian]], the love interest of the legendary  outlaw [[Robin Hood]] in [[English folklore]].

German is not the only language to have a specific name for male virginity; in French, male virgins are called "[[wikt:puceau|puceau]]". The Greek word for "virgin" is ''parthenos'' ([[wikt:παρθένος|παρθένος]], see [[Parthenon]]). Although typically applied to women, like English, it is also applied to men, in both cases specifically denoting absence of sexual experience. When used of men, it does not carry a strong association of "never-married" status. However, in reference to women, historically, it was sometimes used to refer to an engaged woman—''parthenos autou'' (παρθένος αὐτού, his virgin) = his [[Engagement|fiancée]] as opposed to ''gunē autou'' (γυνή αὐτού, his woman) = his wife. This distinction is necessary due to there being no specific word for wife (or husband) in Greek.

By extension from its primary sense, the idea that a virgin has a sexual "blank slate",&lt;ref name="Shanahan"&gt;"The emotional stress of [[Serial monogamy|serial]] non-marriage plays havoc with the possibility of partnering for life." Angela Shanahan, [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/sex-revolution-robbed-us-of-fertility/story-e6frg6zo-1111114422989 'Sex revolution robbed us of fertility',] ''[[The Australian]]'' 15 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; unchanged by any past intimate connection or experience,&lt;ref name=Shanahan /&gt; can imply that the person is of unadulterated purity.

==Culture==
===Concept===
The concept of virginity has significance only in a particular social, cultural and moral context. According to [[Hanne Blank]], "virginity reflects no known biological imperative and grants no demonstrable evolutionary advantage."&lt;ref name="Blank" /&gt; Although virginity has historically been correlated with purity and worth, many feminist scholars believe that it is a myth. They argue that no standardized medical definition of virginity exists, there is no scientifically verifiable proof of virginity loss, and sexual intercourse results in no change in personality.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Purity Myth|last=Valenti|first=Jessica|publisher=Seal Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Valenti]], feminist writer and author of ''[[The Purity Myth]]'', reasons that the concept of virginity is also dubious because of the many individual definitions of virginity loss, and that valuing virginity has placed a woman's morality "between her legs." She critiques the notion that sexual activity has any influence on morality or ethics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The urge of wanting one's spouse or partner to be never engaged in sexual activities is called "virgin complex". A person may also have a virgin complex directed towards oneself.&lt;ref name="sohu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sohu.com/s2012/dianji-995/|title=Chinese entangled with female virgin complex|publisher=Sohu News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yan-yan, W. A. N. G. "The World with Light and Shadow——Analysis of the Sex Consciousness of ZHANG Zi-ing's Sex Novels." (2007): 006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, Don. "Dreams and Dreaming and The Father In WP Kinsella's Shoeless Joe." Aethlon 19.2 (2002): 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
==={{anchor|Loss of virginity}}Definitions of virginity loss===

There are varying understandings as to which types of sexual activities result in loss of virginity. The traditional view is that virginity is only lost through vaginal penetration by the penis, consensual or non-consensual, and that acts of [[oral sex]], [[anal sex]], [[mutual masturbation]] or other forms of [[non-penetrative sex]] do not result in loss of virginity. A person who engages in such acts without having engaged in vaginal intercourse is often regarded among heterosexuals and researchers as "technically a virgin".&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intimate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite book| author = Ken Plummer | title = Modern Homosexualities: Fragments of Lesbian and Gay Experiences | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 2002 | pages = 187–191 | accessdate = August 24, 2013|isbn =1134922426 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSO3q4XEfz4C&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XfpWU-LSA4uhyAS6_ILwBw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|quote=The social construction of 'sex' as vaginal intercourse affects how other forms of sexual activity are evaluated as sexually satisfying or arousing; in some cases whether an activity is seen as a sexual act at all.

Carpenter, many men and women discussed how they felt virginity could not be taken through rape. They described losing their virginities in one of three ways: "as a gift, stigma or part of the process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00224490109552080 | volume=38 | title=The ambiguity of "having sex": The subjective experience of virginity loss in the united states | journal=Journal of Sex Research | pages=127–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpenter states that despite perceptions of what determines virginity loss being as varied among gay men and lesbians as they are among heterosexuals, and in some cases more varied among the former, that the matter has been described to her as people viewing sexual acts relating to virginity loss as "acts that correspond to your sexual orientation," which suggests the following: "So if you're a gay male, you're supposed to have anal sex because that's what gay men do. And if you're a gay woman, then you're supposed to have oral sex, because that's what gay women do. And so those become, like markers, for when virginity is lost."&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;

A 2003 study published in the ''[[Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality]]'' focusing on definitions of having sex and noting studies concerning university students from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia reported that "[w]hile the vast majority of respondents (more than 97%) in these three studies included penile-vaginal intercourse in their definition of sex, fewer (between 70% and 90%) respondents considered penile-anal intercourse to constitute having sex" and that "oral-genital behaviours were defined as sex by between 32% and 58% of respondents".&lt;ref name="Randall"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Randall, H. E., &amp; Byers, S. E.|title=What is sex? Students’ definitions of having sex, sexual partner, and unfaithful sexual behaviour|journal=[[The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality]]|volume=12|issue=|pages=87–96|year=2003|pmid=|doi=|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-114049357/what-is-sex-students-definitions-of-having-sex|quote=Recently, researchers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia have investigated university students' definitions of having sex. These studies found that students differ in their opinions of what sexual behaviours constitute having sex (Pitts &amp; Rahman, 2001; Richters &amp; Song, 1999; Sanders &amp; Reinisch, 1999). While the vast majority of respondents (more than 97%) in these three studies included penile-vaginal intercourse in their definition of sex, fewer (between 70% and 90%) respondents considered penile-anal intercourse to constitute having sex. Oral-genital behaviours were defined as sex by between 32% and 58% of respondents.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different study by the Kinsey Institute sampled 484 people, ranging in ages 18–96. "Nearly 95 percent of people in the study agreed that penile-vaginal intercourse meant 'had sex.' But the numbers changed as the questions got more specific." 11 percent of respondents based "had sex" on whether the man had achieved an [[orgasm]], concluding that absence of an orgasm does not constitute "having had" sex. "About 80 percent of respondents said penile-anal intercourse meant 'had sex.' About 70 percent of people believed oral sex was sex."&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;

[[Virginity pledge]]s (or abstinence pledges) made by heterosexual teenagers and young adults may also include the practice of "technical virginity". In a peer-reviewed study by sociologists [[Peter Bearman]] and Hannah Brueckner, which looked at virginity pledgers five years after their pledge, they found that the pledgers have similar proportions of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs) and at least as high proportions of anal and oral sex as those who have not made a virginity pledge, and deduced that there was substitution of oral and anal sex for vaginal sex among the pledgers. However, the data for anal sex without vaginal sex reported by males did not reflect this directly.&lt;ref name="webmdVPDCSR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/news/20050322/virginity-pledges-dont-cut-std-rates|title=Virginity Pledges Don't Cut STD Rates|work=WebMD.com|accessdate=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="promise"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Brueckner|first2=Hannah|date=April 2005|title=After the promise: The STD consequences of adolescent virginity pledges|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.362.6308&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=36|issue=4|pages=271–278|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2005.01.005|pmid=15780782|last1=Bearman|first1=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early loss of virginity ===

Early loss of virginity has been shown to be linked to factors such as level of education, independence, biological factors like age and gender, and social factors such as parental supervision or religious affiliation, with the most common being sociodemographic variables.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lammers|first=Cristina|last2=Ireland|first2=Marjorie|last3=Resnick|first3=Michael|last4=Blum|first4=Robert|date=2000-01-01|title=Influences on adolescents’ decision to postpone onset of sexual intercourse: a survival analysis of virginity among youths aged 13 to 18 years|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X99000415|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=26|issue=1|pages=42–48|doi=10.1016/S1054-139X(99)00041-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this, sexual abuse has also been shown to have a link to later risky sexual behaviors and a younger age of voluntary sexual intercourse. Sexual initiation at an earlier age has been associated with: less frequency of condom use, less satisfaction and more frequency of non-autonomous reasons for that first sexual encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osorio|first=Alfonso|last2=Lopez-del Burgo|first2=Cristina|last3=Carlos|first3=Silvia|last4=de Irala|first4=Jokin|date=2017|title=The Sooner, the Worse?

These medical consequences consist of an increase in STDs, cervical cancer, pelvic inflammatory disease, fertility and unwanted pregnancies.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

===Female virginity===

====Cultural value====

The first act of sexual intercourse by a female is commonly considered within many cultures to be an important personal milestone. Its significance is reflected in expressions such as "saving oneself", "losing one's virginity," "taking someone's virginity" and sometimes as "deflowering." The occasion is at times seen as the end of innocence, integrity, or purity, and the [[sexualization]] of the individual.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=Laura M.|date=May 2001|title=The Ambiguity of "Having Sex": The Subjective Experience of Virginity Loss in the United States|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=38|doi=10.1080/00224490109552080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, there was a cultural expectation that a female would not engage in [[premarital sex]] and would come to her wedding a virgin and that she would "give up" her virginity to her new husband in the act of [[consummation]] of the marriage. Feminine sexual practices have revolved around the idea of females waiting to have sex until they are married.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speaking of Sexuality: Interdisciplinary Readings Third Edition|last=Moore, Newlyn B.; Davidson Sr., J. Kenneth; Fisher, Terri D.|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=9780195389494|location=New York, New York|page=256|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some females who have been previously sexually active (or their hymen has been otherwise damaged) may undergo a surgical procedure, called [[hymenorrhaphy]] or hymenoplasty, to repair or replace her hymen, and cause vaginal bleeding on the next intercourse as proof of virginity ([[#Proof of virginity|see below]]).&lt;ref name=Regain&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/04/30/us-muslimwomen-europe-virginity-idUSL2532025120070430?pageNumber=2&amp;sp=true |title=Muslim women in France regain virginity in clinics |work=[[Reuters]] | date=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, an unmarried female who is found not to be a virgin, whether by choice or as a result of a [[rape]], can be subject to shame, ostracism or even an [[honor killing]]. In those cultures, female virginity is closely interwoven with personal or even family honor, especially those known as [[Shame society|shame societies]], in which the loss of virginity before marriage is a matter of deep shame.&lt;ref name="Bennett"/&gt; In some parts of [[Subsaharan Africa|Africa]], the myth that [[virgin cleansing myth|sex with a virgin can cure]] [[HIV/AIDS]] continues to prevail, leading to girls and women being raped.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/1362134/South-African-men-rape-babies-as-cure-for-Aids.html South African men rape babies as 'cure' for Aids]".

Virginity is regarded as a valuable commodity in some cultures. In the past, within most societies a woman's options for marriage were largely dependent upon her status as a virgin. Those women who were not virgins experienced a dramatic decrease in opportunities for a socially advantageous marriage, and in some instances the premarital loss of virginity eliminated their chances of marriage entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schlegel|first=Alice|date=November 1991|title=Status, Property, and the Value on Virginity|journal=American Ethnologist|volume=18|issue=4|doi=10.1525/ae.1991.18.4.02a00050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[virginity auction]]s, like that of [[Natalie Dylan]], are discussed in the 2013 documentary ''[[How to Lose Your Virginity]].'' 

The Bible required a man who seduced or raped a virgin to pay her [[bride price]] to her father and marry the girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|22:16–17|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:28–29|NIV}}. See also [[Shotgun wedding]].&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, until the late 20th century, a woman could [[Seduction (tort)|sue a man]] who had taken her virginity but did not marry her. In some languages, the compensation for these damages are called "[[wreath money]]".&lt;ref&gt;Brockhaus 2004, ''Kranzgeld''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proof of virginity====
{{main|Virginity test}}
Some cultures require proof of a bride's virginity before her marriage. This has traditionally been tested by the presence of an intact [[hymen]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which was verified by either a physical examination (usually by a physician, who provided a "certificate of virginity") or by a "proof of blood," which refers to vaginal bleeding that results from the tearing of the hymen after the first sanctioned sexual contact.&lt;ref name="Hymen"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Perlman |first=Sally E. |author2=Nakajyma, Steven T. |author3=Hertweck, S.

Coerced medical virginity tests are practiced in many regions of the world, but are today condemned as a form of abuse of women. According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO): "[[Sexual violence]] encompasses a wide range of acts including (...) violent acts against the sexual integrity of women, including female genital mutilation and ''obligatory inspections for virginity''".&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/summary_en.pdf World report on violence and health.] Geneva: World Health Organization, 2002. pp. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers stress that the presence or absence of a hymen is not a reliable indicator of whether or not a female has been vaginally penetrated.&lt;ref name="Hymen"/&gt; The hymen is a thin film of [[mucous membrane|membrane]] situated just inside the [[vulva]] which can partially occlude the entrance to the [[vaginal canal]]. It is flexible and can be stretched or torn during first engagement in vaginal intercourse. However, a hymen may also be broken during physical activity. Many women possess such thin, fragile hymens, easily stretched and already perforated at birth, that the hymen can be broken in childhood without the girl even being aware of it, often through athletic activities. For example, a slip while riding a [[bicycle]] may, on occasion, result in the bicycle's saddle-horn entering the introitus just far enough to break the hymen.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studenthealth.co.uk/advice/advice.asp?adviceID=148 |title=Torn hymen (virgin or not?) |publisher=Studenthealth.co.uk |date=2005-12-12 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there is the case of women with damaged hymens undergoing [[hymenorrhaphy]] (or hymenoplasty) to repair or replace their hymens, and cause vaginal bleeding on the next intercourse as proof of virginity.&lt;ref name="Regain"/&gt; Others consider the practice to be [[virginity fraud]] or unnecessary. Some call themselves [[born-again virgin]]s.

There is a common belief that some women are born without a hymen,&lt;ref name=emans&gt;Emans, S. Jean. "Physical Examination of the Child and Adolescent" (2000) in ''Evaluation of the Sexually Abused Child: A Medical Textbook and Photographic Atlas'', Second edition, Oxford University Press. 61–65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCann"&gt;McCann, J; Rosas, A. and Boos, S.

Forensic Medicine: Clinical and Pathological Aspects, Greenwich Medical Media: London, a)p.453, b)p.455 c)p.460.&lt;/ref&gt; but some doubt has been cast on this by a recent study.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/health/12klas.html?_r=1 The Marks of Childhood or the Marks of Abuse?], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that almost all women are born with a hymen, but not necessarily ones that will experience a measurable change during first experience of vaginal intercourse.

Some medical procedures occasionally may require a woman's hymen to be opened ([[hymenotomy]]).

===Male virginity===
Historically, and in modern times, female virginity has been regarded as more significant than male virginity; the perception that sexual prowess is fundamental to masculinity has lowered the expectation of male virginity without lowering the social status.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asencio"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Marysol Asencio|title=Sex and sexuality among New York's Puerto Rican youth|publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]|year = 2002|accessdate=October 9, 2011|pages=57–64 |isbn=1-58826-073-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8AlJw95JhewC&amp;pg=PA57}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in some [[Islam]]ic cultures, though premarital sex is forbidden in the [[Quran]] with regard to both men and women, unmarried women who have been sexually active or raped may be subject to name-calling, [[shunning]], or family shame, while unmarried men who have lost their virginities are not.&lt;!-- NOTE: This is reliably sourced.

Male sexuality is seen as something that is innate and competitive and displays a different set of cultural values and stigmas from female sexuality and virginity. In one study, scholars Wenger and Berger found that male virginity is understood to be real by society, but it has been ignored by sociological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berger | first1 = D. | last2 = Wenger | first2 = M. | year = 1973 | title = The Ideology of Virginity | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 35 | issue = 4| pages = 666–676 | doi = 10.2307/350880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within American culture in particular, male virginity has been made an object of embarrassment and ridicule in films such as ''[[Summer of '42]]'', ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' and ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'', with the male virgin typically being presented as socially inept.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leigh"/&gt; Such attitudes have resulted in some men keeping their status as a virgin a secret.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Odeh, Lama.

The prevalence of virginity varies from culture to culture. In cultures which place importance on a female's virginity at marriage, the age at which virginity is lost is in effect determined by the age at which marriages would normally take place in those cultures, as well as the minimum [[Marriageable age|marriage age]] set by the laws of the country where the marriage takes place.&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;

In a cross-cultural study, ''At what age do women and men have their first sexual intercourse?'' (2003), Michael Bozon of the French [[Institut national d'études démographiques]] found that contemporary cultures fall into three broad categories.&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt; In the first group, the data indicated families arranging marriage for daughters as close to puberty as possible with significantly older men. Age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at later ages than that of women, but is often extra-marital. This group included [[sub-Saharan Africa]] (the study listed [[Mali]], [[Senegal]] and [[Ethiopia]]). The study considered the [[Indian subcontinent]] to also fall into this group, although data was only available from [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;

In the second group, the data indicated families encouraged daughters to delay marriage, and to abstain from sexual activity before that time. However, sons are encouraged to gain experience with older women or prostitutes before marriage. Age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at lower ages than that of women. This group includes Latin cultures, both from [[southern Europe]] ([[Portugal]], [[Greece]] and [[Romania]] are noted) and from [[Latin America]] ([[Brazil]], [[Chile]], and the [[Dominican Republic]]). The study considered many Asian societies to also fall into this group, although matching data was only available from [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;

In the third group, age of men and women at sexual initiation was more closely matched. There were two sub-groups, however. In non-Latin, Catholic countries ([[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] are mentioned), age at sexual initiation was higher, suggesting later marriage and reciprocal valuing of male and female virginity. The same pattern of late marriage and reciprocal valuing of virginity was reflected in [[Singapore]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The study considered [[China]] and [[Vietnam]] to also fall into this group, although data were not available.&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;

Finally, in northern and eastern European countries, age at sexual initiation was lower, with both men and women involved in sexual activity before any union formation. The study listed [[Switzerland]], Germany and the [[Czech Republic]] as members of this group.&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;

According to a 2001 [[UNICEF]] survey, in 10 out of 12 developed nations with available data, more than two thirds of young people have had sexual intercourse while still in their teens. In Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Norway, the United Kingdom and the [[United States]], the proportion is over 80%. In Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, approximately 25% of 15-year-olds and 50% of 17-year-olds have had sex.&lt;ref name=oecd &gt;UNICEF.

According to a 2011 CDC study, in the 15-to-19-year-old age group 43 percent of males and 48 percent of females in the [[United States]] reported never having an opposite-sex partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicholas Bakalar |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/health/research/26statistics.html |title=For a Sex Survey, A Little Privacy Goes a Long Way |work=The New York Times |date=2011-04-25 |accessdate=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rates of [[teenage pregnancy]] vary and range from 143 per 1000 girls in some sub-Saharan African countries to 2.9 per 1000 in South Korea.

Many Western countries have instituted sex education programs, the main objective of which is to reduce such pregnancies and STDs. In 1996, the United States federal government shifted the objective of sex education towards "[[abstinence-only sex education]]" programs, promoting sexual abstinence before marriage (i.e., virginity) and prohibiting information on birth control and contraception. In 2004, President [[George W. Bush]] announced a Five-Year Global [[HIV/AIDS]] Strategy, also known as the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://img.thebody.com/whitehouse/aids_emergency.pdf|title = Organization|publisher = DoS|accessdate = 2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which committed the U.S. to provide $15 billion over five years toward AIDS relief in 15 countries in [[Africa]] and the [[Caribbean]], and in [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;The 15 countries are Botswana, Côte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana, Haiti, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, and Zambia.&lt;/ref&gt; A part of the funding was earmarked specifically for "abstinence-only-until-marriage" programs.

In one peer-reviewed study about virginity pledges, male pledgers were 4.1 times more likely to remain virgins by age 25 than those who did not pledge (25% vs 6%), and estimated that female pledgers were 3.5 times more likely to remain virgins by age 25 than those who did not pledge (21% vs 6%).&lt;ref name="webmdVPDCSR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="promise"/&gt;

[[Psychology]] explores the connection between thought and behavior. Seeking understanding of social (or anti-social) behaviors includes sexual behavior. Joan Kahn and Kathryn London studied U.S. women married between 1965 and 1985 to see if virginity at marriage influenced risk of divorce. In this study, women who were virgins at the time of marriage were shown to have less marital upset. It was shown that when observable characteristics were controlled, women who were non-virgins at the time of marriage had a higher risk for divorce. However, it was also shown that the link between premarital sex and the risk of divorce were attributed to prior unobserved differences, such as deviating from norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kahn | first1 = J. | last2 = London | first2 = K. | year = 1991 | title = Premarital Sex and the Risk of Divorce | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 845–855 | doi=10.2307/352992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethics ==

=== Social norms and legal implications ===
{{Main|Sexual morality|Norm (sociology)}}
Human sexual activity, like many other kinds of activity engaged in by humans, is generally influenced by social rules that are culturally specific and vary widely. These social rules are referred to as sexual morality (what can and can not be done by society's rules) and sexual norms (what is and is not expected). There are a number of groups within societies promoting their views of sexual morality in a variety of ways, including through sex education, religious teachings, seeking commitments or virginity pledges, and other means.

Most countries have laws which set a [[Marriageable age|minimum marriage age]], with the most common age being 18 years, reduced to 16 in "special circumstances", typically when the female partner is pregnant, but the actual [[age at first marriage]] can be considerably higher. Laws also prescribe the minimum age at which a person is permitted to engage in sex, commonly called the [[age of consent]]. Social (and legal) attitudes toward the appropriate age of consent have drifted upwards in modern times. For example, while ages from 10 to 13 were typically acceptable in [[western world|Western countries]] during the mid-19th century,&lt;ref name="waites"&gt;{{cite book| last=Waites| first=Matthew| title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship| publisher=Palgrave Macmillan| year=2005| isbn=1-4039-2173-3| oclc=238887395 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century were marked by changing attitudes resulting in raising the ages of consent to ages generally ranging from 16 to&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;ref name="Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230 |title=Children and Youth in History &amp;#124; Age of Consent Laws |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the age of consent varies from 12 years (or onset of puberty) to 21, but 16 to 18 is the most common range of ages of consent, but some jurisdictions also have a "close-in-age" exception, allowing two adolescents (as young as 12 years of age) to have sex with each other provided their ages are not more than 2 years apart. &lt;!--For the average age at which adolescents have their first sexual experience, see "Prevalence of virginity" above. --&gt;Some countries outlaw any sex outside marriage entirely.

Historically, and still in many countries and jurisdictions today, a female's sexual experience is sometimes considered a relevant factor in the prosecution of a perpetrator of rape.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Also, historically, a man who "took" a female's virginity could be forced to marry her. In addition, children born as a result of premarital sex were subject to various legal and social disabilities such as being considered [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] and thus barred from [[inheritance|inheriting]] from the [[putative father]]'s [[estate (law)|estate]], from bearing the father's surname or title, and support from the putative father. Many of these legal disabilities on children born from extramarital relationships have been abolished by law in most Western countries, though social ostracism may still apply.

===Religious views===

{{Main|Religion and sexuality}}
All major religions have [[moral code]]s covering issues of sexuality, morality, and ethics. Though these moral codes do not address issues of sexuality directly, they seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's [[human sexual activities|sexual activities]] and practices.{{citation needed|reason=entire sentence appears to be OR.|date=September 2013}} However, the impact of religious teaching has at times been limited. For example, though most religions disapprove of [[premarital sex|premarital sexual relations]], it has always been widely practiced{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence e.g. historical data|date=May 2013}}. Nevertheless, these religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples' attitudes to sexual issues.

====Buddhism====
{{main|Buddhism and sexuality}}

The most common formulation of Buddhist ethics for [[Laity|lay followers]] are the [[The Five Precepts|Five Precepts]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path|Eightfold Path]]. These precepts take the form of voluntary, personal undertakings, not divine mandate or instruction. The third of the Five Precepts is "To refrain from committing sensual misconduct".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Five Precepts: pañca-sila|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sila/pancasila.html|publisher=Access to Insight|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sensual misconduct is defined in the [[Pali Canon]] as follows:

{{quote|Abandoning sensual misconduct, [a man] abstains from sensual misconduct. He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers, their fathers, their brothers, their sisters, their relatives, or their Dhamma; those with husbands, those who entail punishments, or even those crowned with flowers by another man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cunda Kammaraputta: To Cunda the Silversmith|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.176.than.html|work=Anguttara Nikaya|publisher=Access to Insight|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Virginity, specifically, is not mentioned in the Canon. On the other hand, [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Buddhist monks and nuns]] of most traditions are expected to refrain from all sexual activity and the [[Sakyamuni Buddha|Buddha]] is said to have admonished his followers to avoid unchastity "as if it were a pit of burning cinders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Saddhatissa | first =Hammalawa | title =Buddhist Ethics: The Path to Nirvana | publisher =Wisdom Pubns; New Ed edition |date=December 1987 | location = | page =88 | url =
  | doi = | isbn = 0-86171-053-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd of the 5 precepts in Buddhism warns against any sensual misconduct, though the exact definition of it is unclear. Buddhists have been more open compared to other religions about the subject of sex and that has expanded over time. As with Christianity, although a traditionalist would assume that one should not have sex before marriage, many Buddhists do. There are different branches of Buddhism, like tantric and puritan, and they have very different views on the subject of sex, yet managed to get along. Tantric is a Sanskrit word; it is typically translated as two things or person being bound together. In the time of Gotama, the man who came to be known as Buddha, sex was not taboo. The world the prince lived in was filled with earthly pleasures. Women naked from the waist above were in the court solely to serve the prince. Gotama's father even constructed a chamber of love. Prince Gotama and founded the beginnings of Buddhism, which included the denial of earthly pleasures in order to follow the Middle Way. The stark contrast between the way Buddha lived his life before and after rejecting the material world may arguably be one of the reasons Buddhism evolved the way it did. In the present, the mother of a Buddha does not have to be a virgin; she must have never had a child, however.

====Hinduism====
In Hinduism, premarital virginity on the part of the bride is considered ideal.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipner|first=Julius|authorlink=Julius J. Lipner|title=Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-05182-7 |pages=375 pages, see:268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing Hindu marriage ceremony, or the [[Vedic wedding]], centers around the ''[[Kanyadan]]'' ritual, which literally means ''gift of a virgin,'' by father of the maiden through which the Hindus believe they gain greatest spiritual merit, and marriages of the daughters are considered a spiritual obligation.&lt;ref name=marriage&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramusack|first1=Sharon|first2=Barbara N.L.|last2=Sievers.|title=Women in Asia: restoring women to history Restoring women to history|year=1999|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-21267-7|pages=266 pages(see page 30)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purity of women is especially valued in South Asia, where Hinduism is most commonly practiced. &lt;!--Because of this, women are often denied access to higher education because it requires being in the presence of men more often than not. However, with time there have been changes in the ideology of Hinduism. The idea of a pure virgin is very valued, but it is also important that women are fertile and able to bear sons. It's seen as destructive for women to menstruate unless they have a husband, who may turn it into something more productive. An aspect of Hinduism is men exerting control over women and furthermore, their offspring and possessions. Hinduism has the distinction of being one of the oldest religions. However, adultery is only condemned if it effects family matters. This may possibly be a reflection of the reasons male control over females is so important.--&gt;

Sex had never been a taboo in ancient India and intactness of the hymen had nothing to do with virginity.&lt;ref name=ero&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Benjamin|title=The Hindu world: an encyclopedic survey of Hinduism, Volume 2 The Hindu World: An Encyclopedic Survey of Hinduism, Benjamin Walke|year=1968|publisher=Praeger,|pages=571–572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sikhism====
In Sikhism, sexual activity is supposed to occur only between married individuals. Sikhism advises against premarital sex, as it has a high potential of being an indulgence of [[lust]] (''[[kaam]]'', or extreme sexual desire). Sikhism teaches that young women must have decent modesty (''sharam)'' because the honor (''[[Izzat (honour)|izzat]])'' of her family could be jeopardized.  Sexual activity and even living together prior to marriage is not allowed in Sikhism.  Virginity is an important aspect of spirituality and it has to be preserved before marriage, or when one is ready to move into another sacred state of being with their significant other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xW33ZuBnNC0C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=sources+on+sikhism+sex+before+marriage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nQy8YaRrZB&amp;sig=r0SHR1CfDucZ7ret5vWIlFBxIEY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1v8a-xp_ZAhXo4IMKHemMCOoQ6AEIaDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=sources%20on%20sikhism%20sex%20before%20marriage&amp;f=false|title=God and Morality|last=Wright|first=Christopher J. H.|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199148394|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
{{main|Judaism and sexuality}}
Premarital sex is forbidden in Judaism. In fact, the precedent for the ''[[mitzvot]]'' which are related in Deuteronomy 22:25-29, which regard what happens when a man rapes a virgin, may well have been set at [[Shechem]] after the [[rape of Dinah]] (cf. Genesis 34).

There are other references in the [[Torah]] to virginity. In the first reference, in {{bibleverse||Genesis|19:8|HE}}, Lot offers his virgin daughters to the people of Sodom for sexual purposes in an attempt to protect his guests (cf. Genesis 19:4-11), with the implication that the people of Sodom would be more likely to accept the offer in view of the girls' virginity than they would otherwise. This also sets the precedent for [[Israelites]] to avoid homosexual activity (cf. Leviticus 18:22, 20:13.&lt;ref&gt;Also see [http://www.brandeis.edu/projects/fse/judaism/docs/essays/same-sex-marriage.pdf Gail Labovitz's essay] on the [[Talmudic]] view of [[same-sex marriage]]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The next reference is at {{bibleverse||Genesis|24:16|HE}}, where [[Eliezer]] is seeking a wife for his master, Abraham's son. He meets [[Rebecca]], and the narrative tells us, "the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her" (in biblical terms, "to know" is a euphemism for sexual relations).

As for any child born to a single woman, he or she is not regarded as illegitimate (a ''[[mamzer]]'') or subject to social or religious disabilities—Perez and Zerach, for example (and although their mother was a widow who was willingly impregnated by her father-in-law), were not counted as ''mamzerim'' (cf. Genesis 38:24-30).

[[Halakhah]] also contains rules related to protecting female virgins, and rules regarding pre-marital sex, rape, and the effects of each.

In [[Torah]], a damsel who has not the sign of virginity in the early marriage shall be punished by death penalty, since the unvirgin woman among Israel is equal with a defiled whore in her father's house.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Deuteronomy|22:20-21|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ancient Greece and Rome====
Virginity was often considered a virtue denoting purity and physical self-restraint and is an important characteristic in [[Greek mythology]].

In ancient Greek literature such as the [[Homeric Hymns]], there are references to the Parthenon goddesses [[Artemis]], [[Athena]], and [[Hestia]] proclaiming pledges to eternal virginity (Greek: παρθενία).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ciocani|first=Vichi Eugenia|date=2013|title=Virginity and representation in the Greek novel and early Greek poetry|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1631081850/|via=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been argued a maiden's state of ''parthenia'' (Greek: παρθένος), as invoked by these deities, carries a slightly different meaning from what is normally understood as virginity in modern western religions.&lt;sup&gt;[[Talk:Virginity#cite note-:0-15|[15]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Rather, ''parthenia'' focused more on marriageability and abstract concepts without strict physical requirements which would be adversely affected, but not entirely relinquished, by pre-marital sexual intercourse. For these reasons, other goddesses not eternally committed to ''parthenia'' within the Homeric Hymns are able to renew theirs through ritual (such as [[Hera]]) or choose an appearance which implies the possession of it (such as [[Aphrodite]]).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In Roman times, the [[Vestal Virgin]]s were the highly respected, strictly [[Celibacy|celibate]] (although not necessarily [[Vestal Virgin#Selection|virginal]]) [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|priestesses]] of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], and keepers of the [[sacred fire of Vesta]]. The Vestals were committed to the priesthood before puberty (when 6–10 years old) and sworn to [[celibacy]] for a period of 30 years.&lt;ref name="Lutwyche"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lutwyche|first=Jayne|title=Ancient Rome's maidens – who were the Vestal Virgins?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/18490233|accessdate=2012-11-23|newspaper=BBC|date=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chastity of the Vestals was considered to have a direct bearing on the health of the Roman state. Allowing the sacred fire of Vesta to die out, suggesting that the goddess had withdrawn her protection from the city, was a serious offence and was punishable by scourging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Vesta |volume=27 |page=1055}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because a Vestal's chastity was thought to be directly correlated to the sacred burning of the fire, if the fire were extinguished it might be assumed that a Vestal had been unchaste. The penalty for a Vestal Virgin found to have had sexual relations while in office was being [[Premature burial|buried alive]].&lt;ref name="Lutwyche"/&gt;

====Christianity====
[[File:Giorgione 045.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''The Reading Madonna'' by [[Giorgione]] (c. 1500)]]
{{main|Christianity and sexuality|Catholic Church and women#Virginity}}
[[Paul the Apostle]] expressed the view that a person's body belongs to God and is God's temple ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:13|NIV}}, {{bibleverse-nb|1|Corinthians|3:16|NIV}}), and that premarital sex is immoral ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:18|NIV}}) on an equal level as adultery. ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:9|NIV}}) Paul also expressed the view in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7:1–7|NIV}} that sexual abstinence is the preferred state for both men and women. However, he stated that sexual relations are expected between a married couple.

According to classicist [[Evelyn Stagg]] and New Testament scholar [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]], the New Testament holds that sex is reserved for marriage.&lt;ref name="Staggs"&gt;Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. ''Woman in the World of Jesus.'' Philadelphia: Westminster, 1978. {{ISBN|0-664-24195-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They maintain that the New Testament teaches that sex outside of marriage is a sin of [[adultery]] if either of the participants is married, otherwise the sin of [[Porneia|fornication]] if neither of the participants are married. An imperative given in 1&amp;nbsp;Corinthians says, "Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins people commit are outside their bodies, but those who sin sexually sin against their own bodies."{{Bibleref2c|1Co|6:18|TNIV|1 Cor 6:18}} Those who are sexually immoral or adulterers are listed in {{Bibleref2|1Cor|6:9|NIV|1&amp;nbsp;Corinthians 6:9}} in a list of "wrongdoers who ... will not inherit the kingdom of God." {{Bibleref2|Galatians|5:19}} and {{Bibleref2|1Cor|7:2|NIV|1&amp;nbsp;Corinthians 7:2}} also address fornication. The ''Apostolic Decree'' of the [[Council of Jerusalem]] also includes a prohibition on fornication.

[[Aquinas]] went further, emphasizing that acts other than copulation destroy virginity, and clarifying that involuntary sexual pleasure does not destroy virginity. From his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', "Pleasure resulting from resolution of semen may arise in two ways. If this be the result of the mind's purpose, it destroys virginity, ''whether copulation takes place or not''. Augustine, however, mentions copulation, because such like resolution is the ordinary and natural result thereof. On another way this may happen beside the purpose of the mind, either during sleep, or through violence and without the mind's consent, although the flesh derives pleasure from it, or again through weakness of nature, as in the case of those who are subject to a flow of semen. On such cases virginity is not forfeit, because such like pollution is not the result of impurity which excludes virginity."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3152.htm Summa Theologica], Second Part of the Second Part, Question 152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Blank, ''Virgin: The Untouched History'' (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-59691-010-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Virgo inter Virgines IMG 1383.JPG|thumb|''Virgo inter Virgines'' (The Blessed Virgin Mary with other holy virgins), from [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]] during the last quarter of the 15th century.]]

Some have theorized that the New Testament was not against sex before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Shelby Spong]], ''The Living Commandments''.&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion turns on two Greek words — ''moicheia'' (''μοιχεία'', adultery) and ''porneia'' (''πορνεία'', [[fornication]], see also [[pornography]]). The first word is restricted to contexts involving sexual betrayal of a spouse; however, the second word is used as a generic term for illegitimate sexual activity. Elsewhere in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|}}, incest, homosexual intercourse (according to some interpretations)&lt;ref&gt;''arsenokoitēs'' (masc. noun of fem. 1st declension), literally a man who shares a bed with other men (see [[LSJ]] and [[BDAG]]).&lt;/ref&gt; and prostitution are all explicitly forbidden by name (however, the Septuagint uses "porneia" to refer to male temple prostitution). Paul is preaching about activities based on sexual prohibitions in [[Leviticus]], in the context of achieving holiness. The theory suggests it is these, and only these behaviors that are intended by Paul's prohibition in chapter seven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orion.mscc.huji.ac.il/symposiums/11th/papers/FrommHoliness.doc Syriac- Christian and Rabbinic Notions of Holy Community and Sexuality] Naomi Koltun-Fromm April 2006 pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The strongest argument against this theory is that the modern interpretation of the New Testament, outside Corinthians, speaks against premarital sex.&lt;ref&gt;Modern interpretation of the significance of "wrong his brother" in {{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|4:6|NIV}}, includes sleeping with the brother's future wife. However, {{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|4:3|NIV}} only specifically prohibits ''fornication''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian orthodoxy accepts that [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]], was a virgin at the time Jesus was conceived, based on the accounts in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|1:18|NIV}} and {{bibleverse||Luke|1:26–35|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches additionally hold to the [[dogma]] of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]].&lt;ref name=MWebster &gt;''Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions'' by Merriam-Webster, Inc. 1999 {{ISBN|0-87779-044-2}} page 1134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1K.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §499]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/liturgy/liturgy.html Divine Liturgy of St John Chrysostom], [http://www.coptic.net/prayers/StBasilLiturgy.html Coptic Liturgy of St Basil], [http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/liturgy/liturgy_of_st_cyril.pdf Liturgy of St Cyril], [http://www.anastasis.org.uk/lit-james.htm Liturgy of St James] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410212030/http://www.anastasis.org.uk/lit-james.htm |date=2014-04-10 }}, [http://www.frmichel.najim.net/liturgyvid.pdf Understanding the Orthodox Liturgy] etc.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most Protestants reject the dogma, citing sources such as {{bibleverse||Mark|6:3|NIV}}: "Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And aren't His sisters here with us?". The Catholic Church holds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PW8.HTM#$3DY |title=New American Bible |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in Semitic usage the terms "brother," "sister" are applied not only to children of the same parents, but to nephews, nieces, cousins, half-brothers, and half-sisters. Catholics, Orthodox Christians and other groups may refer to Mary as ''the Virgin Mary'' or ''the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]''.

The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' says: "There are two elements in virginity: the material element, that is to say, the absence, in the past and in the present, of all complete and voluntary delectation, whether from [[lust]] or from the lawful use of marriage; and the formal element, that is the firm resolution to abstain forever from sexual pleasure" and that "Virginity is irreparably lost by sexual pleasure, voluntarily and completely experienced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia, 'Virginity' |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-10-01 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for the purposes of [[consecrated virgins]] it is canonically enough that they have never been married or lived in open violation of chastity.

====Islam====
{{See also|Zina}}
[[Islam]] considers extramarital sex to be sinful and forbidden &lt;ref name="Bennett"/&gt; however an exception exists for one's own slave girls, to include those who were married at the time of enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;Quran, Surah 23: 5-6, Surah 4: 23&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[Shari'a|Islamic law]] prescribes punishments for Muslim men and women for the act of zinā, in practice it is an extremely difficult offense to prove, requiring four respectable witnesses to the actual act of penetration. Though in Western cultures premarital sex and loss of virginity may be considered shameful to the individual, in some Muslim societies an act of premarital sex, even if not falling within the legal standards of proof, may result in personal shame and loss of [[family honor]].&lt;ref name="Bennett"/&gt;

In some modern-day largely Muslim societies such as [[Turkey]], vaginal examinations for verifying a woman's virginity are a clinical practice which are at times state-enforced. These types of examinations are typically ordered for women who go against traditional societal notions of "public morality and rules of modesty", though in 1999 the Turkish penal code was altered to require a woman's consent prior to performing such an examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parla|first=Ayse|date=Spring 2001|title=The "Honor" of the State: Virginity Examinations in Turkey|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=27|issue=1|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''walk of shame''' refers to a situation in which a person must walk past strangers or peers alone for an embarrassing reason before reaching a place of safety and privacy.

In sports in which a [[penalty card]] - generally red in colour - is shown to a player and results in their ejection from the match, their passage off the pitch is frequently referred to as a walk of shame, especially in instances where the player looks more remorseful than angry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.espn.co.uk/scrum/rugby/story/208887.html |title=The Walk of Shame |work=[[ESPN]] |date=13 December 2013 |accessdate=11 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/prestons-alan-browne-forced-return-walk-shame-down-tunnel-be-shown-red-card |title=Preston's Alan Browne forced to return from walk of shame down tunnel to be shown red card |work=[[FourFourTwo]] |date=23 October 2017 |accessdate=11 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/slideshow/1845/7/title/hazard-sees-red-for-ball-boy-boot/fixtures/premier-league |title=Hazard's Walk of Shame |work=[[Goal (website)|goal.com]] |date=24 January 2013 |accessdate=11 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is generally amplified, especially in [[association football]], as the opposing team's supporters generally feel few inhibitions at barracking the player with abuse as they leave.

It often occurs the morning after a night out at a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]], [[nightclub]], or [[party]]. People undertaking the walk of shame are understood to have spent the night at the residence of a [[sexual partner]] (or perceived sexual partner), particularly a [[one-night stand]].&lt;ref name="etc"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.academia.edu/302074/The_Walk_of_Shame_A_Normative_Description | title= The walk of shame: a normative description | author= Lunceford, Brett  | publisher=''[[Institute of General Semantics|ETC: A Review of General Semantics]]'' | date= October 1, 2008 | accessdate=May 30, 2016}} ("This essay considers how the descriptor "walk of shame" functions to discipline female sexual practice by reinforcing gender stereotypes and punishing women who transgress socially constructed norms.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paul"&gt;Paul, Elizabeth J.

In [[exhibitionism]], the walk of shame may also refer to an exhibitionist walking in public while exposed—either partially or fully naked—and trying to reach a place of safety and privacy.

==Accusations==

The investigation began in January 1995 when Detective Robert Perez was told by his 13-year-old [[Foster care|foster daughter]], Donna Perez, that she had been sexually molested. She said she had been raped or molested by almost every adult she knew, and that the same molestation had occurred to almost every other child she knew. On March 13, 1995, Perez put Donna in his police car with two social services caseworkers and they drove through Wenatchee and East Wenatchee. Donna pointed out houses and buildings where she says she and other children were repeatedly raped and molested since January 1988. She listed 22 locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Children sacrificed for the case.  |url=http://seattlepi.com/powertoharm/history.html | publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date= February 23, 1998 |quote=On the morning of March 13, 1995, Perez put Donna in the front seat of his police car. Two CPS caseworkers were in the back taking notes as they drove through Wenatchee and East Wenatchee.

Along the way she saw a delivery man and a taxi driver. They were added to the list."|accessdate=2007-11-26 }} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the people convicted were poor, [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] and on [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States|welfare]], and their lawyers stated that their guilty pleas were coerced. In 1995, after Pastor Robert Roberson criticized the investigation, he was arrested and charged with eleven counts of the sexual abuse of a child. Roberson and his wife were acquitted of all charges.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |first= Timothy|last= Egan|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Pastor and Wife Are Acquitted on All Charges in Sex-Abuse Case. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/12/us/pastor-and-wife-are-acquitted-on-all-charges-in-sex-abuse-case.html |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=December 12, 1995 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrests==
Forty-three adults were arrested on 29,726 charges of child sex abuse, involving 60 children in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A record of abuses in Wenatchee. |url=http://seattlepi.com/powertoharm/|publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |quote=The town of Wenatchee, Washington, made world headlines in 1994 and 1995 when police and state social workers undertook what was then called the nation's most extensive child sex-abuse investigation.|accessdate=2007-11-26 }} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents and Sunday school teachers were charged, and many were convicted of abusing children, often including their own, or their foster children.

==Trial==
Prosecutors were unable to provide any physical evidence to support the charges. The main witness was Perez' foster daughter; Perez was the investigator of the cases.&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt;

==Conviction review summary==
Those who were convicted were freed by higher courts and had their convictions overturned or pleaded guilty on lesser charges. Five served their full sentences before their cases were overturned. Some lost parental rights. By 2000, the last person in custody, Michael Rose, was released, after a judge vacated his March 1995 convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Last child-sex ring defendant released from prison after court action. |url=http://seattlepi.com/local/wena27ww.shtml | publisher = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date= December 27, 2000|quote=When he got out of prison, Michael Rose hugged his mother and just felt relieved that the ordeal of child-sex ring prosecution was over. |accessdate=2007-11-26 }} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culpability==
In 1996, a consultant, retired Bellevue Police Chief D.P. Van Blaricom, hired by a city insurer who looked into how the Wenatchee police ran the child abuse investigations, stated that the cases were handled properly.  In 1998, Phillip Esplin, a forensic psychologist for the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s Child Witness Project said that "Wenatchee may be the worst example ever of mental health services being abused by a state ... to control and manage children who have been frightened and coerced into falsely accusing their parents and neighbors of the most heinous of crimes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Wenatchee abuses attacked nationally. |url=http://seattlepi.com/powertoharm/after13.html |publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=May 28, 1998 |quote=The Wenatchee child sex-abuse investigations are the nation's most blatant example of continuing judicial abuse, civil libertarians and nationally known commentators said at a conference here yesterday. |accessdate=2007-11-26 }} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, a jury found the city of [[Wenatchee]] and [[Douglas County, Washington]] negligent in the 1994-1995 investigations.

'''White Colombians''' are the Colombian descendants of [[Europe]]an (overwhelmingly Spanish) and [[Middle Eastern]] (primarily Lebanese and Syrian) people, who self identify as such. According to the 2005 Census 85% of Colombians do not identify with any ethnic group, thus being either White or Mestizo, which are not categorized separately. It is nevetherless estimated that 37% of the Colombian population can be categorized as [[White people|white]], forming the second largest racial group after [[mestizo]]s (at 49 percent).&lt;ref name="BushnellHudson2010"&gt;{{cite book|format=PDF|last1=Bushnell|first1=David|last2=Hudson|first2=Rex A.|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pdf/CS_Colombia.pdf|title=Colombia: a country study|editor=Rex A.

==Numbers and distribution==

The various racial groups exist in differing concentrations throughout the nation, in a pattern that to some extent goes back to colonial origins. [[Paisa Region]] and [[Bogotá]] have the a largest concentration of White Colombians. Whites tend to live mainly in the urban centers, like [[Cali]], [[Medellín]] or [[Bogotá]], and the burgeoning highland cities.&lt;ref&gt;Bushnell &amp; Hudson, p. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Colonial period===
The presence of Whites in Colombia began in 1510 with the colonization of [[San Sebastián de Urabá]]. In 1526, settlers founded [[Santa Marta]], the oldest Spanish city still in existence in Colombia.
Many [[Spanish diaspora|Spaniards]] began their exploration searching for [[gold]], while others established themselves as leaders of the native social organizations teaching the [[Christian]] faith and the ways of their civilization. [[Catholic]] priests would provide education for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] that otherwise was unavailable. Within 100 years after the first Spanish settlement, nearly 95 percent of all Native Americans in Colombia had died. The majority of the deaths were the cause of diseases spread by the settlers, such as [[measles]] and [[smallpox]]. Some natives were also killed in armed conflicts with their new neighbours.

===Immigration from Europe===

Colombia was one of early focus of [[Basque people|Basque]] and [[Sephardi]] immigration.&lt;ref name = "jews"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.npr.org/2012/12/20/167714541/lost-jews-of-colombia-say-theyve-found-their-roots|title= 'Lost Jews' Of Colombia Say They've Found Their Roots|publisher= npr.org|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1540 and 1559, 8.9% of the residents of Colombia were of Basque origin. Basque priests introduced handball into Colombia.&lt;ref name=Pastor&gt;Possible paradises: Basque emigration to Latin America by José Manuel Azcona Pastor, P.203&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish converts to Christianity and some crypto-Jews also sailed with the early conquistadors. It has been suggested that the present day culture of business entrepreneurship in the region of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] and [[Valle del Cauca]] is attributable to the Basque and Sephardi immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wasko |first=Dennis |url=http://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Food-And-Wine/The-Jewish-Palate-The-Jews-of-Colombia |title=The Jewish Palate: The Jews of Colombia - Arts &amp; Culture - Jerusalem Post |publisher=Jpost.com|date=13 June 2011|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amerikanuak"&gt;Amerikanuak: Basques in the New World by William A. Douglass, Jon Bilbao, P.167&lt;/ref&gt; Few Colombians of Basque descent are aware of their ethnic heritage.&lt;ref name="Amerikanuak"/&gt; In Bogota, there is a small colony of thirty to forty families who emigrated as a consequence of the [[Spanish Civil War]], or because of different opportunities.&lt;ref name="Amerikanuak" /&gt; Basque priests were the ones that introduced handball into Colombia.&lt;ref name="Pastor"/&gt; Basque immigrants in Colombia were devoted to teaching and public administration.&lt;ref name=Pastor /&gt; In the first years of the Andean multinational company, Basque sailors navigated as captains and pilots on the majority of the ships until the country was able to train its own crews.&lt;ref name=Pastor /&gt;

The first German immigrants arrived in the 16th century contracted by the Spanish Crown, and included explorers such as [[Ambrosio Alfinger]]. There was another small wave of German immigrants at the end of the 19th and beginning of 20th century including Leo Siegfried Kopp, the founder of the famous Bavaria Brewery.
[[SCADTA]], a Colombian-German air transport corporation which was established by German expatriates in 1919, was the first commercial airline in the [[western hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jim Watson |url=http://www.stampnotes.com/Notes_from_the_Past/pastnote248.htm |title=SCADTA Joins the Fight |publisher=Stampnotes.com |date= |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1941 the [[United States]] government estimated that there were 4,000 [[Germans]] living in Colombia. Another 7,000 German Jews joined their ranks in Colombia's burgeoning cities.&lt;ref name=LB&gt;Latin America during World War II by Thomas M. Leonard, John F. Bratzel, P.117&lt;/ref&gt; 
There were some [[Nazi]] agitators in Colombia, such as [[Barranquilla]] businessman Emil Prufurt,&lt;ref name=LB /&gt; but the majority was apolitical. Colombia asked Germans who were on the U.S. blacklist to leave and allowed Jewish refugees in the country illegally to stay.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;

There had also been Italian immigration of a few thousands people, however it is to a much lesser degree than to other Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil. Indeed, approximately 30,000 Italians have emigrated to Colombia since colonial times. It is calculated, by the Italian Embassy in [[Bogota]], that in 2010 more than 120,000 Colombians have direct or distant roots in Italian emigrants. Actually 14,216 Italians are residents in Colombia (2011 "Anagrafe Italiani iscritti estero - AIRE").

===Immigration from the Middle East===
{{main|Arab diaspora in Colombia}}
The first and largest wave of immigration from the [[Middle East]] began around 1880, and remained during the first two decades of the 20th century. They were mainly [[Maronite Christians]] from [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], fleeing because of financial hardships and the repressions of the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]]. When they were first processed in the ports of Colombia, they were classified as Turks because the region was a territory of the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]]. Lebanese, Syrians,&lt;ref name=LABLAA&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Posada|first1=Louise Fawcett|author2=Eduardo Posada-Carbó|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/publicacionesbanrep/boletin/boleti5/bol29/tierra3.htm|title=En la tierra de las oportunidades: los sirio-libaneses en Colombia|trans-title=In the land of opportunity: the Syrian-Lebanese in Colombia|language=es|journal=Boletín cultural y bibliográfico|publisher=La Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango|volume=XXIX|issue=29|year=1992|accessdate=24 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803102828/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/publicacionesbanrep/boletin/boleti5/bol29/tierra3.htm|archivedate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinians and some Israelis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02619288.1997.9974903?journalCode=fimm20 |title=Arabs and Jews in the development of the Colombian Caribbean 1850–1950|date=21 June 2010 |website=tandfonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; continue since then to settle in Colombia.&lt;ref name=LABLAA/&gt; It is estimated that Colombia has a Middle-Eastern population of 700,000+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.anba.com.br/noticia_diplomacia.kmf?cod=8701931 |title=Agência de Notícias Brasil-Árabe |publisher=.anba.com.br |date= |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to poor existing information it's impossible to know the exact number of people that immigrated to Colombia. A figure of 5,000-10,000 from 1880 to 1930 may be reliable.&lt;ref name="LABLAA"/&gt; Whatever the figure, Lebanese are perhaps the biggest immigrant group next to the Spanish since independence.&lt;ref name="LABLAA"/&gt; Those who left their homeland in the Middle East to settle in Colombia left for religious, economic, and political reasons.&lt;ref name="LABLAA"/&gt; A few simply left to experience the adventure of migrating. After [[Barranquilla]] and [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Bogota]] was among the cities with the largest number of [[Arabic]]-speaking representatives in Colombia in 1945.&lt;ref name="LABLAA"/&gt;

==Ethnic breakdown==
White Colombians are mainly of Spanish descent, who arrived in the beginning of the 16th century when Colombia was part of the [[Spanish Empire]]. During the 19th and 20th centuries, other European and Middle Eastern peoples migrated to Colombia, notably [[Lebanese people]] but also [[German people|Germans]], [[Italian people|Italians]], [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanians]], and [[British people|British]] among others.

==Religion==
The most predominant religion is [[Christianity]], particularly [[Roman Catholicism]]. Under 1% practice [[Buddhism]],  [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]]. Despite strong numbers of Christian adherents, 35.9% of Colombians reported that they did not practice their faith actively.&lt;ref name="Religion"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bdigital.unal.edu.co/8486/1/williammauriciobeltran.2011.pdf|title= Descripción cuantitativa de la pluralización religiosa en Colombia |author = Beltrán Cely, William Mauricio |authorlink = William Mauricio Beltrán Cely |publisher=Bdigital.unal.edu.co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wichí languages''' are an indigenous language family spoken by the [[Wichí]] in northwestern Argentina and far-southeastern Bolivia, part of the [[Matacoan languages|Matacoan]] family. They are also known as Mataco, Wichi, Wichí Lhamtés, Weenhayek, Noctenes, Matahuayo, Matako, Weʃwo. The name ''Mataco'' is common but pejorative.

== Status ==
Currently, the Argentine government does not have education in indigenous languages in schools. Because the Wichí have to be fluent in Spanish to access government services, and children are only educated in Spanish, Wichí children only speak Spanish among themselves. This has made all Wichí dialects vulnerable to extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://commons.emich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1151&amp;context=theses|title=A phonological description of Wichí: The dialect of Misión La Paz, Salta, Argentina|last=Zdrojkowski Avram|first=Megan Leigh|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
They include the following languages:
*[[Noktén language|Noktén]] (a.k.a. Noctén, [[Wichí Lhamtés Nocten]]), spoken in Bolivia and Argentina
*[[Vejoz language|Vejoz]] (a.k.a. Vejo, Pilcomayo, Bermejo, [[Wichí Lhamtés Vejoz]]), spoken in Argentina and Bolivia
*[[Wiznay language|Wiznay]] (a.k.a. Güisnay, [[Wichí Lhamtés Güisnay]]), spoken in Argentina.

The Argentine [[National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina|National Institute of Statistics and Censuses]] (INDEC) gives a figure of 36,135 Wichí speakers in Argentina.

In Rosario, the third biggest city of Argentina, there is a community of about 10,000 [[Wichí people]], all of them fluent in Wichi, and some native speakers. There are a couple of bilingual primary schools.

For Bolivia, Alvarsson estimated between 1,700 and 2,000 speakers in 1988; a census reported 1,912, and Diez Astete &amp; Riester (1996) estimated between 2,300 and 2,600 Weenhayek in sixteen communities.

According to Najlis (1968) and Gordon (2005), three main dialects can be distinguished in the Wichí group: southwestern or Vejós (Wehwós), northeastern or Güisnay (Weenhayek) and northwestern or Nocten (Oktenay). Tovar (1981) and other authors claim the existence of only two dialects (northeastern and southwestern), while Braunstein (1992-3) identifies eleven ethnic subgroups.

Wichí languages are predominantly [[suffix]]ing and [[polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]]; verbal words have between 2 and 15 morphemes. Alienable and inalienable [[possession (linguistics)|possession]] is distinguished. The phonological inventory is large, with simple, [[glottalization|glottalized]]  and [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] [[stop consonant|stop]]s and [[sonorant]]s. The number of [[vowel]]s varies with dialect (five or six).

'''William R. Bascom''' (1912–1981) was an American [[folklorist]], [[anthropologist]], and [[museum]] director.  

== Biography ==
Bascom completed his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]], and earned his [[Ph.D.]] in anthropology at [[Northwestern University]] under [[Melville J. Herskovits]] in 1939.  He taught at Northwestern, [[Cambridge University]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he was also Director of the [[Lowie Museum of Anthropology]].  During World War II, he joined the [[Office of Strategic Services|O.S.S.]] and together with [[Ralph Bunche]] co-authored an unsigned volume, ''A Pocket Guide to West Africa'' in 1943.

Bascom was a specialist in the art and culture of [[West Africa]] and the [[African Diaspora]], especially the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of [[Nigeria]].  Several of his articles on [[folkloristics]] serve as texts in graduate courses in folklore.

== Four functions of folklore ==
In a major article published in 1954, Bascom argued that folklore can serve four primary functions in a culture: 
*Folklore lets people escape from repressions imposed upon them by society ex: tall tales
*Folklore validates culture, justifying its rituals and institutions to those who perform and observe them. 
*Folklore is a pedagogic device which reinforces morals and values and builds wit. ex: scary stores/moral lessons 
*Folklore is a means of applying [[Peer pressure|social pressure]] and exercising [[social control]]. ex: the boy who cried wolf

The '''Wolof people''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|w|oʊ|l|ɒ|f}})&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Wolof|title=Wolof - definition of Wolof in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a [[West Africa]]n ethnic group found in northwestern [[Senegal]], [[The Gambia]] and southwestern coastal [[Mauritania]]. In Senegal, the Wolof are the largest ethnic group (~39%),&lt;ref name=ciawolof&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sg.html Senegal], CIA Factbook; Wolof 38.7% of 14.32 million&lt;/ref&gt; while elsewhere they are a minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sg.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They refer to themselves as ''Wolof'' and speak the [[Wolof language]] – a [[West Atlantic languages|West Atlantic]] branch of the [[Niger–Congo family]] of languages.&lt;ref name="Levinson1996wol"/&gt;

Their early history is unclear and based on [[oral tradition]]s that link the Wolof to the [[Almoravids]]. The earliest documented mention of the Wolof is found in the records of 15th-century Portuguese financed Italian traveller [[Alvise Cadamosto]], who mentioned well established Islamic Wolof chiefs advised by Muslim counselors and divines.&lt;ref name="Levinson1996wol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levtzion2000p78"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nehemia Levtzion|author2=Randall Pouwels|title=The History of Islam in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1Ipt5A9mLMC&amp;pg=PA78|year=2000|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-8214-4461-0|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wolof belonged to the medieval era [[Wolof Empire]] of Senegambia region.&lt;ref name="Levtzion2000p78"/&gt;

In and after the 18th century, the Wolofs were impacted by the violent [[jihad]]s in West Africa, which triggered internal disagreements among the Wolof on Islam.&lt;ref name="Levtzion2000p78"/&gt; In the 19th century, as the colonial French forces launched a war against the Wolof kingdoms, the Wolof people resisted the French and converted to Islam.&lt;ref name="Levtzion2000p78"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Janet Gritzner 2005 40–41"&gt;{{cite book|author=Janet Gritzner|title=Senegal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dNSrPncx8NkC&amp;pg=PA40 |year=2005|publisher=Infobase |isbn=978-1-4381-0539-0|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mara A.

==Name==
The term ''Wolof'' also refers to the [[Wolof language]] and to their states, cultures, and traditions. Older French publications frequently employ the spelling "''Ouolof''"; up to the 19th century, the spellings "Volof" and "Olof" are also encountered. In English, '''Wollof''' and '''Woloff'''&lt;ref name=oed&gt;"Wolof, n. and adj." in the ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; are found, particularly in reference to the [[Gambia]]n Wolof. (The spelling "Wollof" is closer to the native pronunciation of the name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lrc.columbia.edu/students/languages/wolof.html&lt;/ref&gt;) The spelling '''Jolof''' is often used, but in particular reference to the Wolof [[Jolof Empire|empire]] and [[Jolof Kingdom|kingdom]] in central [[Senegal]] that existed from the 14th to the 19th centuries. Similarly, a West African rice dish is known in English as '''[[jollof rice]]'''.&lt;ref name="Diner's Dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ayto|first1=John|title=The Diner's Dictionary: Word Origins of Food and Drink|date=2012|edition=2nd|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199640249|page=188|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NoicAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=Jollof+rice+west+africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwA2oVChMI5s-b5tmoxwIVpbPbCh1odQAj#v=onepage&amp;q=Jollof%20rice%20west%20africa&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origins of the Wolof people are obscure, states David Gamble – a professor of Anthropology specializing on [[Senegambia]] and Africa studies.&lt;ref name=gamblesengam&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Gamble| author2= Linda K Salmon| author3= Ajhaji Hassan Njie|title= Peoples of The Gambia: The Wolof| year=1985| publisher= San Francisco State University Press|pages=3–5 |url=http://www.smcm.edu/gambia/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2015/03/gamble-17.pdf |oclc= 16815490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archeological artifacts have been discovered in Senegal and The Gambia, such as pre-historic pottery, the 8th century stones, and 14th century burial mounds, but states Gamble, these provide no evidence that link them exclusively to the Wolof ethnic group. Their name as the Wolof first appears in the records of 15th century Portuguese travelers.&lt;ref name=gamblesengam/&gt;

With the Arab conquests of West Africa in last centuries of the 1st millennium CE, one theory states that the Wolof people were forced to move into north and east Senegal where over time villages developed into autonomous states such as Baol, Kayor, Saloum, Dimar, Walo and Sine the overall ruling state being that of Jolof who came together voluntarily to form the Jolof Empire.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} According to Gamble, this migration likely occurred at the end of 11th century when the [[Ghana Empire]] fell to the Muslim armies from Sudan.&lt;ref name=gamblesengam/&gt;

Another oral tradition tells of a legend in Walo, which starts with two villages near a lake in a dispute. A mysterious person arose from the lake to settle the dispute. The villagers detained him, he settled among them and became the one who settled disputes and a sovereign authority. He was called ''Ndyadyane Ndyaye'', and his descendants were called ''Ndiayes'' or ''Njie'', and these led to ruling families of Wolof, Mali and Morocco, according to this mythical legend.&lt;ref name=gamblesengam/&gt; The documented history, from 15th-century onwards is a complex story of rivalry between powerful families, wars, coups and conquests in Wolof society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Gamble| author2= Linda K Salmon| author3= Ajhaji Hassan Njie|title= Peoples of The Gambia: The Wolof| year=1985| publisher= San Francisco State University Press|pages=5–6 |url=http://www.smcm.edu/gambia/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2015/03/gamble-17.pdf |oclc= 16815490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wolof Empire===
{{Main article|Jolof Empire|Jolof Kingdom}}
[[File:Wolof Locator.png|thumb|right|Locator map for Wolof ethnic distribution. Note that this shows areas of traditional concentration of Wolof communities. Distribution of self-identified Wolof people is wider, populations are intermixed, and use of Wolof language has come to be near-universal in Senegal.]]

The [[Jolof Empire|Jolof or Wolof Empire]] was a medieval West African state that ruled parts of Senegal and the Gambia from approximately 1350 to 1890. While only ever consolidated into a single state structure for part of this time, the tradition of governance, caste, and culture of the Wolof dominate the history of north-central Senegal for much of the last 800 years. Its final demise at the hands of French colonial forces in the 1870s-1890s also marks the beginning of the formation of Senegal as a unified state.

By the end of the 15th century, the Wolof states of Jolof, Kayor, Baol and Walo had become united in a federation with Jolof as the metropolitan power. The position of king was held by the Burba Wolof and the rulers of the other component states owed loyalty and tribute payments to him. Before the Wolof people became involved in goods and slave trading with the Portuguese merchants on the coast, they had a long tradition of established trading of goods and slaves with the Western [[Sudan]]ese empires and with [[Imamate of Futa Toro]] and other ethnic groups in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Klein (1977), "Servitude among the Wolof and Sereer of Senegambia", in Slavery in Africa: Historical and anthropological perspectives (Editors: Suzanne Miers, Igor Kopytoff), University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|978-0299073343}}, pages 335-336, 339-343&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
Slavery has been a part of the Wolof people since their earliest known history. In the pre-colonial era, slaves were either born or acquired through purchase or capture.&lt;ref name=gamblesgslave&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Gamble| author2= Linda K Salmon| author3= Ajhaji Hassan Njie|title= Peoples of The Gambia: The Wolof| year=1985| publisher= San Francisco State University Press|pages=17–18 | oclc= 16815490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese had begun purchasing slaves from Senegambia ports and caravan traders coming through the Wolof people lands before the 18th century. A major source of slaves sold by Wolof elites, and of Wolof slaves, were the war captives taken during the wars between the ethnic groups in West Africa. Slave raiding, just to obtain slaves for sale, were another significant source of slaves in Wolof territories.&lt;ref name=klein350&gt;Martin Klein (1977), "Servitude among the Wolof and Sereer of Senegambia", in Slavery in Africa: Historical and anthropological perspectives (Editors: Suzanne Miers, Igor Kopytoff), University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|978-0299073343}}, pages 350-355&lt;/ref&gt; The transatlantic demand for slaves in British, French, Dutch and Portuguese colonies, as well as American plantations, along with lucrative prices for slaves increased the economic incentive to scale up the violence as well as the sale of slaves from the social strata within the Wolof society. The sale of weapons and horses to the Wolof elites and warriors made slave raiding easier.&lt;ref name=klein350/&gt;

Early colonial laws that sought to end slave trade were strongly resisted by Wolof elites as well colonial administrators in Senegambia. These laws were evaded. The slavery system was abolished in Wolof lands and its end enforced after 1890s by the British and French colonial authorities when they began ruling The Gambia and Senegal directly, the two major parts where the Wolof people are found.&lt;ref name=gamblesgslave/&gt; However, the social distinctions between the freeborn and the slaves remained strong, during the colonial rule, and even after the two nations gained their independence from the colonial rule.&lt;ref name=gamblesgslave/&gt;

==Demographics==
The Wolof people are the largest ethnic group in Senegal, particularly concentrated in its northwestern region near the [[Senegal River]] and the [[Gambia River]].&lt;ref name=ciawolof/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levinson1996wol"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Levinson|title=Encyclopedia of World Culture, Volume 9: Africa and the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcDMrQEACAAJ|year=1996|publisher=G.K. Hall|isbn=978-0-8161-1808-3|chapter=Wolof}}&lt;/ref&gt; In The Gambia, about 16% of the population are Wolof. In Gambia, they are a minority, yet Wolof language and culture have a disproportionate influence because of their prevalence in [[Banjul]], the Gambian capital, where a majority of the population is Wolof. In Mauritania, about 8% of the population are Wolof. Their total population exceeds 6 million in the three countries.

==Religion==
The vast majority of Wolof people are [[Sunni Muslims]]. However, religious practice often contains local elements.&lt;ref name="Levtzion2000p78"/&gt; The complicated relationship had led to the emergence of Sufi traditions from a historic and dominant Sunni Islam environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. Diouf|author2=M. Leichtman|title=New Perspectives on Islam in Senegal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qerGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91|year=2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-61850-3|pages=91–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Islamic religious traditions of Wolof are unknown, and neither written or oral traditions about their traditional religion are available. The [[oral tradition]]s of the Wolof have legends that state them to have been adherents of Islam since the founding of their [[Kingdom of Jolof]].&lt;ref name="Levtzion2000p78"/&gt; However, historical evidence left by Islamic scholars and European travelers suggest that Wolof kings and warriors did not convert to Islam in the beginning and for many centuries, while accepting and relying on Muslim clerics as counselors and administrators.&lt;ref name="Levtzion2000p78"/&gt;

According to David Gamble, the pre-Islamic beliefs of Wolof may be reflected and absorbed in the Sufi beliefs about good and bad spirits (''jinn''), amulets, dances and other rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Gamble| author2= Linda K Salmon| author3= Ajhaji Hassan Njie|title= Peoples of The Gambia: The Wolof| year=1985| publisher= San Francisco State University Press|pages=39–40 | oclc= 16815490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In and after the 18th century, the Wolofs were impacted by the violent [[jihad]]s in West Africa, which triggered internal disagreements among the Wolof on Islam.&lt;ref name="Levtzion2000p78"/&gt; [[Ira M. Lapidus|Ira Lapidus]] – a professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic History, states that the early 19th century Senegambian jihads "swept through Senegambia burning villages, killing pagans and enslaving their enemies", and were responsible for the conversion of substantial numbers of Wolof to Islam.&lt;ref name="Lapidus2014p473"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ira M. Lapidus|title= A History of Islamic Societies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkJpBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA473 |year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-99150-6|pages=473–476}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West African jihads that involved the Wolof and other ethnic groups started early and often inspired by militant reformers such as those of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ira M.

In the late 19th century, as the colonial French forces launched a war against the Wolof kingdoms, the Wolof people resisted the French and triggered the start of near universal conversion of the Wolof people in Senegambia to Islam.&lt;ref name="Levtzion2000p78"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Janet Gritzner 2005 40–41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mara A.

The Senegalese Sufi [[Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal|Muslim brotherhoods]] appeared in the Wolof communities in the 19th century and grew in the 20th. The Sufi leaders and [[marabouts]] exercise cultural and political influence amongst most Muslim communities, most notably the leader of the ''Muridiyya'' also called the [[Mouride]] brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Gamble| author2= Linda K Salmon| author3= Ajhaji Hassan Njie|title= Peoples of The Gambia: The Wolof| year=1985| publisher= San Francisco State University Press|pages=37–38 | oclc= 16815490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:WolofWaalo.jpg|thumb|180px|alt=An image illustration of a Wolof soldier in the 19th century|A Wolof Waalo in war costume in the mid 19th century.]]
The Wolof people’s traditional culture and practices have survived the colonial era and are a strong element of the [[Culture of Senegal|Senegalese culture]].

===Language===
{{main article|Wolof language}}

'''Wolof''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɒ|l|ɒ|f}}) is a language of [[Senegal]], [[the Gambia]], and [[Mauritania]], and the native language of the Wolof people. Like the neighbouring languages [[Serer language|Serer]] and [[Fula language|Fula]], it belongs to the [[Senegambian languages|Senegambian branch]] of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo language family]]. Unlike most other languages of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], Wolof is not a [[tonal language]].

Wolof originated as the language of the [[Lebu people]].&lt;ref name="FalolaSalm 280"&gt;Falola, Toyin; Salm, Steven J. Urbanization and African cultures. Carolina Academic Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-89089-558-9}}. p 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ngom 2"&gt;Ngom, Fallou. Wolof. Lincom, 2003. {{ISBN|3-89586-845-0}}. p 2&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most widely spoken language in Senegal, spoken natively by the Wolof people (40% of the population) but also by most other Senegalese as a second language.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Wolof [[dialect]]s vary geographically and between rural and urban areas. "Dakar-Wolof", for instance, is an urban mixture of Wolof, [[French language|French]], and [[Arabic]].

===Social stratification===
The Wolof people have had a rigid, patriarchal, endogamous social stratified society at least since the 15th-century.&lt;ref name="Tamari 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=thiaw98/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Bonnie Wright|editor= W Arrens and I Karp| title= Creativity of Power: Cosmology and Action in African Societies | year=1989| publisher= Smithsonian| isbn=978-0874746174|pages= 39–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social strata have included a free category called ''geer'', a castes category called ''nyeenyo'' or ''neeno'', and a servile category of slaves called ''jaam''.&lt;ref name=thiaw98&gt;{{cite book|author=Ibrahima Thiaw|editor=Ulbe Bosma, Gijs Kessler and Leo Lucassen|title=Migration and Membership Regimes in Global and Historical Perspective: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ufOZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98|year=2013|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-25115-1|pages=98–99, 108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gomez24&gt;{{cite book|author= Michael Gomez|title=Pragmatism in the Age of Jihad: The Precolonial State of Bundu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfhGouf7_TsC |year=2002 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52847-4| pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caste status has been hereditary, and endogamy among the men and women of a particular caste status has been an enduring feature among the Wolof people, states Leonardo Villalón – a professor of Political Science and African Studies.&lt;ref name=leonardo56&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonardo A. Villalón|title=Islamic Society and State Power in Senegal: Disciples and Citizens in Fatick|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xFC1KUbXJ6gC |year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-03232-2|pages=56–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wolof's caste status, states Villalón, is a greater barrier to inter-marriage than is either ethnicity or religion in Senegal.&lt;ref name=leonardo56/&gt;

The castes have also been hierarchal, with lowest level being those of griots.&lt;ref name=leonardo54/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Irvine (1989), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/645001 When Talk Isn't Cheap: Language and Political Economy], American Ethnologist, Vol. 16, No. 2 (May, 1989), pages 253-254&lt;/ref&gt; Their inherited inferiority has been culturally stated to be close to those of slaves (''jaams'' or ''kaals'').&lt;ref name=leonardo54&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonardo A. Villalón|title=Islamic Society and State Power in Senegal: Disciples and Citizens in Fatick|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xFC1KUbXJ6gC |year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-03232-2|pages=54, 59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castes, states David Gamble, were associated with ideas of relative purity-impurity.&lt;ref name=gamble16/&gt; The leatherworkers, for example, were considered the lowest of the ''[[Nyamakala|nyenyo]]'' because their occupation involving animal skins was considered dirty.&lt;ref name=gamble16/&gt;

Slaves have historically been a separate, endogamous group in the Wolof society.&lt;ref name=thiaw98/&gt; Slavery was either inherited by birth in the Wolof society, or were kidnapped, purchased as children from desperate parents during difficult times such as a famine, or slavery was imposed by the village elders as a punishment for offenses. By the early 18th-century, all sorts of charges and petty crimes resulted in the accused being punished to the slave strata. Slaves acquired by kidnapping, purchase or as captives of war were called ''jaam sayor'' in the Wolof society.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Klein (1977), "Servitude among the Wolof and Sereer of Senegambia", in Slavery in Africa: Historical and anthropological perspectives (Editors: Suzanne Miers, Igor Kopytoff), University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|978-0299073343}}, pages 343-344&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''geer'' or "freeborn" too had a hierarchical structure. At the top were the royal rulers, below them were the regionally or locally powerful noble lineages who controlled territories and collected tribute, and below them were commoner freeborn called the ''baadoolo'' or "lacking power".&lt;ref name=gamble16&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Gamble| author2= Linda K Salmon| author3= Ajhaji Hassan Njie|title= Peoples of The Gambia: The Wolof| year=1985| publisher= San Francisco State University Press|pages=15–17 |oclc= 16815490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chronological origin of social stratification based on castes and slavery is unclear, likely linked. Tal Tamari – the Chargée de Recherche for Anthropologie at CNRS Paris, suggests that a corollary of the rising slavery system was the development and growth of the caste system among Wolofs by the 15th century, and other ethnic groups of Africa by about the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Tamari 1991p13c"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tamari | first=Tal | title=The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa | journal=The Journal of African History | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=32 | issue=02 | year=1991 | pages=221–250 | doi=10.1017/s0021853700025718 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan McIntosh|editor=Christopher R. DeCorse|title=West Africa During the Atlantic Slave Trade: Archaeological Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Fcr1HSZXNgC |year=2001|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0-7185-0247-8|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Susan McIntosh – a professor of Anthropology specializing in African societies, however, that the emergence of caste systems in West African societies such as Wolof, Mande, Malinke, Serer, [[Soninke people|Soninke]] and others, was likely older.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"/&gt; She places the development and spread of castes in these societies to about the 10th-century, because the slave capture, slave trade and slave holding across the Sahel, West Africa and North Africa, by elite families was an established institution by then, and slavery created a template for servile relationships and social stratification of human beings.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"/&gt; According to Victoria B. Coifman, professor of Afro-American &amp; African Studies, historical evidence suggests that the Wolof people were a matrilineal society before the 14th-century. Later politico-religious changes, such as those brought during the [[Wolof Empire]] era, introduced major changes in the social structure among the Wolofs and many other ethnic groups, including a shift to a patrilineal system.&lt;ref name=thiaw98/&gt;

The divisions, the endogamy among Wolof castes, social and political groups have persisted into the post-colonial independent Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ousmane Silla | title= Persistance des castes dans la société wolof contemporaine|journal = Bulletin de l'Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire, Série B: Sciences humaines| year=1966| volume=28 | issue=3–4| pages=731–770 |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Irvine Judith | year = 1989 | title = When Talk Isn't Cheap: Language and Political Economy | journal = American Ethnologist | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 259–260 | jstor=645001 | doi=10.1525/ae.1989.16.2.02a00040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Households===
The Wolof are primarily rural (~75%), living in small villages. According to David Gamble, the historical evidence suggests Wolofs used to live in large settlements priors to the jihad wars and slave raids.&lt;ref name=gamblevill&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Gamble| author2= Linda K Salmon| author3= Ajhaji Hassan Njie|title= Peoples of The Gambia: The Wolof| year=1985| publisher= San Francisco State University Press|pages=8–10 |url=http://www.smcm.edu/gambia/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2015/03/gamble-17.pdf |oclc= 16815490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolof villages consist of cluster of compounds. Some clusters are random with no central plaza, many are clustered around a plaza with a mosque in the center. Each compound has either round or square huts made from adobe-like mud-millet stalk walls and thatched roofs with a conical shape. A compound is sometimes fenced with a hedge made from reeds or millet-stalk.&lt;ref name=gamblevill/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robertwolof&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert O. Lagacé| author2= Ian Skoggard| title=HRAF Study: Culture of Wolof in Senegal and The Gambia |url=http://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/ehrafe/citation.do?method=citation&amp;forward=browseAuthorsFullContext&amp;id=ms30-000|year=1999 |publisher=Yale University |oclc= 51491669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single compound may have multiple huts, with a patrilocal male as its head, with a different wife and her children in each hut in polygynous households. A compound traditionally operates a joint kitchen, but if there are internal disputes then each family unit cooks separately.&lt;ref name=Robertwolof/&gt;

A village is headed by a chief, called the ''borom dekk''. This role belongs to a caste, and has been hereditary. The chief has been the tribute (tax) collector and the interface between the kingdom officials and the villagers. Typically, the chief is also a Muslim religious leader, called ''seriñ'' ([[marabout]]).&lt;ref name=Robertwolof/&gt; Larger villages have an imam, called the ''yélimaan'', and a hunting or warriors leader called the ''saltigé''. Both have traditionally been hereditary castes. Social relationships within a village are based on hierarchy, while disputes are typically settled with intermediaries and Muslim tribunals headed by an Islamic judge called a ''[[qadi]]''.&lt;ref name=Robertwolof/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eunice A. Charles (1975), Shaikh Amadu Ba and Jihad in Jolof, The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 8, No. 3, pages 367-382&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marriages====
Marriages are endogamous. The preferred and common form of marriage is the bilateral cross-cousin type, with most preferred marriages are those between a man and the daughter of his mother's brother. Multiple marriages have been common, with many Wolof households featuring two wives.&lt;ref name=Robertwolof/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David W. Ames (1955), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3628914 The Economic Base of Wolof Polygyny], Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, Vol. 11, No. 4 (Winter, 1955), pages 391-403&lt;/ref&gt; Dowry among the Wolof people is paid in the form of a [[brideprice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Platteau, Jean-Philippe| author2 = Frederic Gaspart|title= "The Perverse Effects Of High Brideprices"| journal= World Development| volume=35| number=7 |year=2007| pages= 1221–1236| doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2006.09.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dower is the property of the woman upon the consummation of the marriage. A divorce is quite common in the Wolof society and according to the Islamic tenets.&lt;ref name=Robertwolof/&gt;

While slavery is illegal in contemporary African societies, it was common in the history of Wolof people and among the elite castes.&lt;ref name=searing475/&gt; The slaves could not marry without the permission of their owner, and it was usually the responsibility of the slave owner to arrange the marriage of or among his slaves. The slave owner and his descendants also had a right to have sex with slave women owned by the household.&lt;ref name=searing475&gt;{{cite journal | last=Searing | first=James F. | title=Aristocrats, Slaves, and Peasants: Power and Dependency in the Wolof States, 1700-1850 | journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies | volume=21 | issue=3 | year=1988 | pages=475–503 | doi=10.2307/219452 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Klein (1977), "Servitude among the Wolof and Sereer of Senegambia", in Slavery in Africa: Historical and anthropological perspectives (Editors: Suzanne Miers, Igor Kopytoff), University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|978-0299073343}}, pages 343-349&lt;/ref&gt;

===Livelihood===
The Wolof people are traditionally settled farmers and artisans. Millet has been the typical staple, while rice a secondary staple when rains are plenty. Cassava is also grown, but it has been a source of income to the Wolof farmers. Since the colonial era, peanuts has been the primary cash crop.&lt;ref name=Robertwolof/&gt;

Wolof society is patrilineal, and agriculture land is inherited by the landowning caste. The typical farmers in a village pay rent (''waref'') to the landowner for the right to crop his land.&lt;ref name=Robertwolof/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Muhammad Salau| title= THE ROLE OF SLAVE LABOR IN GROUNDNUT PRODUCTION IN EARLY COLONIAL KANO|journal= The Journal of African History|year= 2010| volume=51|number=2|pages=147–165| doi=10.1017/s002185371000023x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolof farmers raise chickens and goats, and dried or smoked fish purchased, both a part of their diet. Cattle too are raised, not for food, but for milk, tilling the land and as a reserve of wealth. Rural Wolof people eat beef rarely, typically as a part of a ceremonial feast. Some villages in the contemporary times share agricultural machinery and sell the peanut harvest as a cooperative.&lt;ref name=Robertwolof/&gt;

Those Wolof people who are of artisan castes work on metal, weave and dye textiles, produce leather goods, make pottery and baskets, tailor clothes, produce thatch and perform such economic activity. Wolof smiths produce tools for agriculture, while another group works on gold jewelry.&lt;ref name=Robertwolof/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Klein (1977), "Servitude among the Wolof and Sereer of Senegambia", in Slavery in Africa: Historical and anthropological perspectives (Editors: Suzanne Miers, Igor Kopytoff), University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|978-0299073343}}, pages 335-363&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupation is traditionally based on gender and inherited caste. Men of certain caste are smiths, leatherworkers, weavers (now the profession of former slave descendants). Religious and political functions have been the domain of men, while women typically keep the household, bring water from their sources such as wells or nearby river. Women also plant, weed, harvest crops and collect firewood. Women of the pottery caste group, also help in steps involved in making pottery.&lt;ref name=Robertwolof/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42827">The tradition of '''women's literary circles in the Arab world''' dates back to the pre-Islamic period when the eminent literary figure, [[Al-Khansa]], would stand in the 'Ukaz market in [[Mecca]], reciting her poetry and airing her views on the scholarship of others. From this, a culture of [[literary criticism]] emerged among [[Arab women]], and under the [[Umayyad dynasty]], [[Sukaynah Bint Al-Husayn]] established the first literary [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] in her home.&lt;ref name="Khaldi 2008 p. 58"&gt;Khaldi, 2008, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition was revived during the late nineteenth century, as a result of sweeping social, political and economic change within the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Europe's increasing political and cultural influence in the region. The initial pioneers of the Arab salon were women from wealthy families in [[Greater Syria]] and [[Egypt]], who returned influenced by interaction with European women during their time spent studying abroad and frequenting [[Parisian salons]], or studying in schools run by European or American missionaries. The [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] evenings, run by women but attended by both men and women, provided a unique opportunity to have discussions about social, political and literary trends of the day. Though the tradition died out somewhat after the [[Second World War]], it has left a lasting legacy on literary culture and women's issues throughout the Arab world. Indeed, more than one hundred years later, the UN [[Arab Human Development Report]] echoes what many people in Arab societies were coming to realise at that time: "An Arab Renaissance cannot be accomplished without the rise of women in Arab countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arab Human Development Report 2005: Towards the Rise of Women in the Arab World|publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]], Regional Bureau for Arab States|location=New York|year=2006 |page=212 |isbn=92-1-126174-0 |url=http://www.arab-hdr.org/publications/other/ahdr/ahdr2005e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background to the nineteenth-century literary societies==

===Women and education===

The educational reforms of the nineteenth century, a period of sweeping social, economic and political transition, resulted from various undercurrents occurring at different levels within the realms of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from the Mashreq (Greater Syria) to the [[Maghreb]] (North Africa). These trends were largely attributable to the increased European presence in the region and their secular ideas of [[modernity]].

At a societal level, the arrival of [[Christian]] missionaries supported by the European and American governments led to the creation of a formal system of education for girls, who had until this period received little or no education. Initially, this took the form of private institutions attracting wealthy and mostly Christian families. However, as these schools became more socially acceptable and affordable, the idea trickled down to the middle classes before finally reaching out to the poor. Thus, a new norm was becoming increasingly prevalent; the idea that girls should receive an education so as to afford them better marriage prospects, and more importantly, to provide them with adequate means in which to educate their children.&lt;ref&gt;Lattouf, 2004, pp. 62-63&lt;/ref&gt; At this point in time, the range of subjects offered to women was limited. However women seized these opportunities to learn, and showed admirable drive and determination. By the middle of the century, a sense of "...awareness and obligation for intellectual and social consciousness, especially the appreciation of women's plight, and the struggle for a voice in society became visible and public."&lt;ref&gt;Lattouf, 2004, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example of the contribution of Western missionaries to increasing educational opportunities for women was the work of Daniel and Abby Maria Bliss, an American couple who moved to [[Beirut]] in 1866 and subsequently set up the Syrian Protestant College (which later became the [[American University of Beirut]]). In 1905, a nursing programme that accepted applications from women was established, and in 1924, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences opened its doors to female students.&lt;ref name="Lattouf p. 70"&gt;Lattouf, 2004, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

The rumblings of reform taking place within [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] society reached the Sultanate, and were eventually echoed at an institutional level. The Ottoman regime, in order to counteract the threat of political and religious influence from the Christian missionary schools and due to the realisation that the empire could not hope to survive without learning the modern natural sciences, began to implement its own reforms (''tanzimat'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haddad |first=Mahmoud |year=1994 |title=The Rise of Arab Nationalism Reconsidered |journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=201–222 |doi=10.1017/S0020743800060219}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Arab historian, Eugene Rogan, the reforms introduced by the Sultanate had little effect on the subjects of the empire. However, by the 1850s and 1860s, the fruits of reform were visible in the daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Rogan, 2009, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

The third (and arguably the most important) current that led to the existence and improvement of women's education in the nineteenth and early twentieth century was due to European [[colonialism]] and its legacy. [[Napoleon's]] short-lived occupation of Egypt (1798–1801) was relatively unsuccessful by French standards. However, their revolutionary ideas and imports in the field of technology and education were to prove more durable in Egypt and the rest of North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Rogan, 2009, pp. 61-64&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of Muhammad 'Ali, an admirer of French innovation and technology, interactions and exchanges between [[Egypt]] and [[France]] in the cultural, academic and scientific fields increased during his reign&lt;ref&gt;Rogan, 2009, "The Egyptian Empire of Muhammad 'Ali", pp. 61-83&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it was not just male students who spent time abroad. Notable Arab hostesses or ''salonnières'' such as [[May Ziade|Mayy Ziyadah]] spent time in France, and the Egyptian feminist and occasional hostess of salon evenings, Huda Sha`arawi, used to grant scholarships to writers enabling them to study in Europe at her own expense.&lt;ref name=zeidan-5053&gt;Zeidan, 1995, pp. 50-53&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas of educational reform and feminism were also occurring elsewhere in the Arab world, with the Syrian writer and scholar, Butrus al-Bustani (1819–1883) in Lebanon among the first to advocate women’s right to education in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;AUC Critical Reference Guide. American University in Cairo Press, 2008 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Two decades later in Tunisia, the reformist, Ahmed Kheireddine, stressed the importance of women's education in the running of households and raising children.&lt;ref name=zayzafoon-99&gt;{{cite book |last=Zayzafoon |first=Lamia Ben Youssef |year=2005 |title=The Production of the Muslim Woman: Negotiating Text, History and Ideology |series=After the Empire |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=0-7391-0962-6 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a small, but crucial step in the emancipation of women in society. Later in Egypt, after the British took over from the French in their 'civilising mission'&lt;ref&gt;Cromer, 1908, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; of Egypt they also contributed to the reform of women's education. In his work entitled, ''Modern Egypt'', [[Lord Cromer]], who had served for almost thirty years as High Commissioner of [[Egypt]], "...by confining the sphere of women's interest to a very limited horizon, cramps the intellect and withers the mental development of one-half of the population in Moslem countries."&lt;ref&gt;Cromer, 1908, pp. 155-156&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1924, when the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the [[American University of Beirut]] began accepting applications from women,&lt;ref name="Lattouf p. 70"/&gt; the norm that "Knowledge rather than ignorance preserves women's dignity and morality"&lt;!--seems to be incorrect--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Totah |first=Khalil A. |origyear=1926 |year=2002 |title=The Contribution of the Arabs to Education |location=New York |publisher=Gorgias Press |isbn=1-931956-79-0 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been firmly established. In the face of confinement and exclusion from the formal education system, middle-class women overcame their exclusion and marginalisation from society, holding informal literary or study circles in their family homes.&lt;ref&gt;Lattouf, 2004, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, women such as [[May Ziade|Mayy Ziyadah]] and Mary 'Ajami went on to pursue higher education in Europe, returning to set up well-known [[salon (gathering)|salons]] and contributing immeasurably to literary circles, print and production in the Arab world.

===Women and the public sphere===
At the turn of the nineteenth century, the idea of the [[harem]] continued to linger in many Arab societies. Women of the urban middle and upper classes were confined to the domestic sphere,&lt;ref name=guenena&gt;{{cite book |last=Guenena |first=Nemat|author2=Nadia Wassef  |url=http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/unfulfilled_promises.pdf |year=1999 |title=Unfulfilled Promises: Women's Rights in Egypt |location=New York |publisher=Population Council |oclc=44159429 |pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the vast majority remained unseen and unheard in public life. Necessity afforded female members of the lower and rural classes slightly more 'freedom', as they were needed to work the land in order to support their families. Women's issues began to emerge from the background - albeit slowly - in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, with the likes of Qāsim Amin (1863–1908)&lt;ref&gt;'Imarah, Muhammad "Qāsim Amin wa-tahrir al-mar'ah". al-Mu'assasah al''Arabiyyah lil-Dirasat wa-al-Nashr, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; calling the seclusion of women an 'injustice'&lt;ref name=guenena/&gt; and advocating partial empowerment of women. However, the majority of prominent feminist writers were men, and the presence of women activists in the [[public sphere]] was virtually non-existent. The salon and its male participants, many of whom were well-known intellectuals, provided them with a means in which to express their ideas and opinions in private, whilst accessing the male-dominant [[public sphere]] through their lively discussions and debates.&lt;ref&gt;Zeidan, 1995, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; In her thesis entitled 'Arab Women Going Public: Mayy Ziyadah and her Literary Salon in a Comparative Context', Boutheina Khaldi remarks that women of the salons overcame the obstacle of gender inequality "by bringing public men into their private salons and hence creating a [[public sphere]] from the very heart of the private one."&lt;ref&gt;Khaldi, 2008, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The essays and letters produced by hostesses and participants of the salons on the topics discussed also had a considerable impact on society at the time, and in particular, the nurturing of the Arab Renaissance and women's emancipation. The publication of letters by is interpreted by [[Jürgen Habermas]] in his writing on the public sphere as bridging the gap between the private sphere in which women gathered, and the public sphere that they sought to shape and conquer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Habermas |first=Jürgen |year=1989 |title=The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: an Inquiry into the Category of Bourgeois Society |series=Studies in contemporary German social thought |others=translated by Thomas Burger and Frederick Lawrence |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-08180-6 |page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women and the Arab cultural renaissance===

The Arab Renaissance ([[al-Nahda]] or {{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;النهضة&lt;/big&gt;}}) was an endeavour to reach a compromise between contemporary practices similar to those in [[Europe]] and a shared Arab heritage, in the hope of shaping a new vision for an Arab society in transition.&lt;ref name="Khaldi 2008 p. 58"/&gt; The relationship between women's literary salons and the Arab Awakening,&lt;ref name=antonius&gt;{{cite book |last=Antonius |first=George |year=1939 |title=The Arab Awakening: The Story of the Arab National Movement |location=Philadelphia |publisher=J.B. Lippincott |lccn=39002445}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it was also referred to, is of paramount importance. Not only were meetings of literary figures an integral part of the Renaissance, but from the beginning of the Arab Renaissance in the nineteenth century, women came to realise the strong bonds between the literary-cultural, social and political, and that the literary movement was key to liberating the 'collective consciousness' from the traditional norms that had stunted their progress. Men also began to acknowledge the importance of women's emancipation to national liberation and development at this time,&lt;ref name=ashour-14&gt;Ashour ''et al.'', 2008, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; and there is no doubt that increased interactions between male and female intellectuals within literary circles made an invaluable contribution. One of the first men to write about the liberation of women was Qāsim Amin, an influential literary figure at the turn of the twentieth century, argued for the emancipation of women for the sake of the Arab Renaissance, as did al-Tahtawi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mai|last=Ghoussoub|authorlink=Mai Ghoussoub|year=2000|chapter=Feminism: Middle East |others=Dale Spender &amp; Cheris Kramaere (eds.) |title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Education: Health to Hypertension |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-92090-6|page=794}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these men frequented [[May Ziade|Mayy Ziyadah]]'s salon in [[Cairo]]. Thus women's desire for emancipation and men's nationalist dreams became the keystone in the advancement of society.&lt;ref name=ashour-14/&gt;

In 1847, two great literary figures of the Arab cultural renaissance, Butrus Al-Bustani and Nasif Al-Yaziji, founded the first literary society, ''Jam'iyyat al-Adab wal-'Ulum'' (The Literary and Scientific Society). Its members were exclusively Syrian Christians and Europeans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tibi |first=Bassam |year=1997 |title=Arab Nationalism: Between Islam and the Nation-State |edition=3rd |others=edited and translated by Marion Farouk-Sluglett and Peter Sluglett |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's press |isbn=0-333-63647-3 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; living and working in diplomatic and missionary circles. However, ten years later, ''al-Jam'iyya al-'Ilmiyya al-Suriyya'' (The Syrian Scientific Society) was established, and attracted Western-educated [[Muslims]] and [[Druze]] as well as [[Christians]]. In 1917, the Tunisian literary figure, Hassan Hosni Abdel-Wahab wrote about the urgent need for educated Muslim young women to take charge of the future and to 'awaken the nationalist spirit', as without this, 'life would turn to nihilism and its consequences'.&lt;ref name=zayzafoon-99/&gt; Only a few years later in the 1920s, Manwia Al-Wartani and Habiba al-Minshari, became the leaders of a dynamic women's movement in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Awdat|first=Hossain|date=November 9, 2009|title=Arab Waman [sic] in religion and society|url=http://www.thara-sy.com/TharaEnglish/modules/news/article.php?storyid=10 |accessdate=January 29, 2011 |publisher=Thara}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like these Tunisian pioneers, women of the upper and middle classes across the increasingly imagined Arab world began to reap the benefits of education, and many of them began to focus on writing and joined their male counterparts in contributing to the Arab Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Badran, Margot, and Miriam Cooke, eds |year= 2004 |title=Opening the Gates: An Anthology of Arab Feminist Writing |location=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-34441-7 |page=xxxviii}}. &amp; Cooke, Miriam. Eds. "",, p.&lt;/ref&gt;

One woman of particular significance to the awareness of the Arab Renaissance amongst women was Princess Nāzīl Fadīl (c.1884-1914). Her salon seems to have had an effect on its male guests, who were usually prominent members of the nationalist cause.&lt;ref name="Khaldi_p47"&gt;Khaldi, 2008, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of women's printing and press, an integral part of middle-class circles&lt;ref&gt;Badran, 1996, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; and the Renaissance, was also intertwined with the literary salon. Many hostesses produced letters and essays on issues discussed in salons, such as equality, women's rights and nationalism. In [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], for example, the press became a partisan for the women, who used it as a transmitter and a publicist for their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fleischmann |first=Ellen |year=2003 |title=The Nation and its "New" Women: the Palestinian Women's Movement, 1920-1948 |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-23789-7 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lebanese journalist, [[Hind Nawfal]] published the first monthly journal, ''al-Fatah'' in 1892 in Egypt, encouraging women to think of journalism as a respectable occupation.&lt;ref name=zeidan-46-49&gt;Zeidan, 1995, pp. 46, 49&lt;/ref&gt; Other journals, many published by Lebanese women in [[Egypt]], followed suit: ''[[Anis al-Jalis]]'', ''al-'A'ilah'', ''al-Mar'ah'', ''al-Zahrah'', ''Fatat al-Sharq'', ''al-A'mal al-Yadawiyyah'' and ''al-'Arous'' (The Bride) which was published by Mary 'Ajami. It is worth noting that this publication did not focus solely on women's issues, but also those related to the Renaissance and nationalism. Whilst the environment in which these female literary figures were operating in was becoming more and more conducive to women's issues, the road to equality and liberation was by no means free from obstacles, and many women published articles under pseudonyms.&lt;ref name=zeidan-46-49/&gt;

==The salon==
{{main article|Salon (gathering)}}

===Terminology===
The French word, ''salon'', which was first uttered in seventeenth century [[France]] comes from the Italian word ''sala''; and was used to define a large reception hall or reception room in a private residence. Later, it was used when referring to social gatherings in nineteenth century France. The word found its way to [[Egypt]] with the Napoleonic expedition, and was one of many traces of the French-Egyptian encounter (1798-1801) and its legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Khaldi, 2008, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the word ''salon'' itself was a European import, there were various words in Arabic that were used to describe various kinds of social gatherings in the Arab world. According to the academic and expert, Boutheina Khaldi, the terms ''nadwah'' or ''nadi'' or ''muntada'' "...were used traditionally to indicate the call on people to gather for a purpose." The word ''majlis'', however, such as the ''majlis'' of the first hostess of an Arab salon - Sukaynah bint al-Husayn - has the specific meaning of assembly, a gathering that might have a more regular or permanent nature in terms of time and place."&lt;ref&gt;Khaldi, 2008, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Khaldi goes on to say that the frequenters of the more modern Arab salons were obviously aware of these, and often used both the French and the Arab words to refer to the gatherings, implying the synthesis of both Arab and European influences in the salon culture.&lt;ref name=khaldi-p59&gt;Khaldi, 2008, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

===The first salon===
The history of the literary [[salon (gathering)|salon]] in the Arab world, of which little is known, dates back far longer than one would expect. [[Sukayna bint Husayn]] (735 / 743), began running her salon centuries during the [[Umayyad]] dynasty, well before the idea was first introduced to seventeenth century [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=zeidan-5053/&gt; She was a highly regarded woman of great intelligence, and an expert in fashion and literature. She was the first woman to open her house to male and female guests, and organised evenings of music, literary criticism and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Khaldi, 2008, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

===European influences===
Many of the Arab women who founded literary [[salon (gathering)|salons]] received at least part of their education in Europe or in European missionary schools, and were thus exposed to certain aspects of European culture, including the salon tradition. In this regard, the great impact of the colonial powers and the imposition of their culture and values on the region cannot be underestimated.&lt;ref name=khaldi-p59/&gt; However, that is by no means to say that the Arab women's literary salon was a passive imitation or export of European ideas. Rather, those men and women who travelled to Europe or who were well-read in European literature selected elements of the European tradition and fused them with the traditional Arab salons of old, which was typical of the Arab Renaissance. Moreover, in 1890, one of the French ''salonnières'', [[Eugénie Le Brun]], chose to hold a salon evening in Cairo in an effort to learn more about women's circles in Egypt, and to encourage the revival of the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Khaldi, 2008, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; 
One of the salons said to have had an influence is Madame de Rambouillet's salon, which opened in 1618 and was held at the [[Hôtel de Rambouillet]] in [[Paris]]. It was the first and most famous salon in French history. Rambouillet made sure to distinguish her salon from an Academy, and emphasised entertainment as well as enlightenment. Like the later literary salons in the Arab world, the gatherings bore witness to the mingling of the literary elite, with male intellectuals and middle-class women. In a similar fashion to the salons in [[Cairo]], topics such as religion, philosophy and history would be discussed, but it is noted that Rambouillet "...made sure the treatment of the subject was not heavy-handed."&lt;ref name=mossiker-28&gt;&lt;!--Assuming this is the 1983 edition and not a misreading for the 1985 ed.--&gt;{{cite book |last=Mossiker |first=Frances |year=1983 |title=Madame de Sévigné: A Life and Letters |location= New York|publisher=Knopf |isbn=0-394-41472-1 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[May Ziade|Mayy Ziyadah]] admired the French "salonnières", and made sure to write copious materials on the well-known French hostess, ''habituée'' and prominent woman of aristocratic Parisian society, [[Madame de Sévigné]], who was herself influenced by her time spent at the Hôtel de Rambouillet.&lt;ref name=khaldi-p59/&gt;&lt;ref name=mossiker-28/&gt; The great Egyptian nationalist and writer, Tāhā Husayn, who began attending Ziyadah's salon after she requested Ahmad Lutfi al-Sayyid bring him along on a Tuesday evening, comments on the fusion of Arab and European influences that created the salons of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries: "Mayy revives by this salon a long-established Arab practice, just as she transfers to Egypt a long-established European practice, ancient and modern."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Khaldi, 2008, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

===An evening spent in the salon===
Unlike salon sessions in England, which sometimes took place during the day or over several days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tinker |first=Chauncey Brewster |year=1967 |origyear=1915 |title=The Salon and the English Letters: Chapters on the Interrelations of Literature and Society in the Age of Johnson |location=New York |publisher=Gordian Press |page=102 |lccn=67021716}}&lt;/ref&gt; the salons in cities such as [[Cairo]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Aleppo]] were usually held in the evening or at night in the family homes of ''salonnières''.&lt;!--needs checking--&gt;&lt;ref name="Khaldi_px"&gt;Khaldi, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One of the less well-known salons in Beirut, for example, was convened on three consecutive full-moon nights each month, where male and female guests stayed awake until dawn, enjoying the entertainment and lively literary discussions.&lt;ref name=zeidan-5053/&gt; It was the norm for salonnières to invite participants, and with notable exceptions such as Mayy Ziyadah who invited guests from different social standings in order to give young writers the opportunity to show off their talents to a discerning audience,&lt;ref&gt;Zeidan, 1995, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; the majority of salons were a space for male and female members of the educated middle class elite.&lt;ref name=Watenpaugh-53&gt;{{cite book |last=Watenpaugh |first=Keith David |year=2006 |title=Being Modern in the Middle East: Revolution, Nationalism, Colonialism and the Arab Middle Class |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-12169-9 |pages=52–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the confines of the salon, the free-flow of conversation and reciprocity was encouraged, and a sense of equality was fostered.&lt;ref&gt;Khaldi, 2008, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The salon evenings were also regarded as arbiters of [[music]] and [[literature]], as well as places were social and political ideas were aired and discussed, and where guests could embrace new trends and fashions exported from [[Europe]]. There was something unique about these salon sessions, according to the historian Keith Watenpaugh, who lends a description of a salon evening:

"...soirées were unrelated men and women circulated with one another freely, and where Christians and Muslims, who shared a similar educational background, drank and smoked cigarettes—rather than sharing a ''nargileh'' ([[hookah]] pipe)—together while they sat in straight back chairs around high tables..."&lt;ref name=Watenpaugh-53/&gt;

The tone and topics of discussion were usually at the discretion of the ''salonnières'' or hostesses, who administered the conversation. Of course, every salon was slightly different, but most evenings offered a mix of serious and lighthearted conversation, with musical entertainment in some cases. As the conversation flowed, it was not uncommon for guests to colour their conversations with personal anecdotes or local gossip. Indeed, it was thought to be a necessary talent of a successful hostess to encourage such digressions.&lt;ref&gt;Khaldi, 2008, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; As these salons were conducted during the Arab Awakening, which advocated a synthesis of tradition and modernity, the use of ''fushā'' (classical Arabic) was emphasised.&lt;ref&gt;Khaldi, 2008, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, specific topics of conversation in the literary salons have remained somewhat of a mystery over the years. However, in ''Yatanaqashun'' (They Discuss), a fictional portrayal of a salon session held in her house in which the subject of 'equality' was discussed at length,&lt;ref&gt;Khaldi, 2008, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Mayy Ziyadah gives a good indication of the content, atmosphere and interactions between male and female participants in her salon.

Antun Sha`arawi also encapsulates the opulent evenings spent in a Syrian salon with his vivid description:

"Wearing either all black or all white dresses ordered from Paris, Marrash hosted the mixed evening get-togethers in which literary topics as varied as the ''Mu'allaqat'', a cycle of seven pre-Islamic poems or the work of Rabelais were discussed. Chess and card games were played, and complicated poetry competitions took place; wine and '''araq'' flowed freely; participants sang, danced, and listened to records played on a phonograph."&lt;ref name=Watenpaugh-53/&gt;

A number of notable men, famous for their ideas and writing frequented the literary salons and contributed to the discussions. Some of them developed friendships with the female hostesses and asked them for their advice and opinions on their work. Among those who visited the salons was the advocate of women's rights and writer, [[Qasim Amin|Qāsim Amin]]; the Islamic reformists, [[Muhammad Abduh|al-Imām Muhammad 'Abduh]] and Rifā'ah Rāfi' al-Tahtāwī; leader of the Egyptian [[Wafd]] party, Sa'd Zaghlul; Lutfī al-Sayyid; the literary critic and journalist, 'Abbas Mahmũd al-'Aqqād; the Syrian poet, [[Khalil Mutran|Khalil Mutrān]]; the journalist Muhammad Husayn Haykal; the poet Ahmad Shawqī; the Egyptian Prime Minister Boutros Ghālī and the Egyptian nationalist and writer, Tāhā Husayn.&lt;ref name=zeidan-5053/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khaldi_px"/&gt; Several of these men published articles and books on women's rights; including Rifā'ah Rāfi' al-Tahtāwi&lt;ref&gt;Zeidan, 1995, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and Qāsim Amin, who is said to have found the inspiration for his seminal works, ''Tahrir al-Mar'ah'' (The Liberation of Women) and ''al-Mar'ah al-Jadidah'' (The New Woman) in Princess Nāzlī al-Fādil's salon.&lt;ref name="Khaldi_p47"/&gt;

==Notable literary salons and societies==

===Marrash's Salon (Aleppo)===

[[Maryana Marrash]]'s salon, the first salon in the nineteenth-century revival movement, was run from the house she shared with her husband in [[Aleppo]]. The habitual gathering offered a private realm in which male and female guests could mingle, network,&lt;ref name=Watenpaugh-53/&gt; and discuss the fashionable topics of the time. Marrash would often entertain her guests by singing and playing the piano.&lt;ref name=zeidan-5053/&gt; Regulars at the salon included prominent literary figures and politicians, such as [[Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi]], [[Qustaki al-Himsi]], [[Rizqallah Hassun]], Kamil al-Ghazzi and Victor Khayyat.&lt;ref name=zeidan-5053/&gt;&lt;ref name=Watenpaugh-53/&gt;

===Princess Nāzlī Fādil's Salon (Cairo)===
[[Nāzlī Fādil]] was one of the first women to revive the tradition of the literary salon and contributed immeasurably to the cause of women's emancipation in the Arab world. She began to invite guests to her [[Cairo]] salon towards the end of the nineteenth century, although the absence of female participants in her salon evenings should be noted. Like Maryana Marrash, Fādil added to the ambience in her salon by playing the piano, while one of her male guests sang and her Tunisian maid danced.&lt;ref name=zeidan-5053/&gt; The men who frequented her salon were prominent in Egyptian and Arab society; including statesmen, diplomats, journalists and literary figures.&lt;ref&gt;Ashour ''et al.'', 2008, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Among the regular visitors to her salon was the renowned Islamic Reformist thinker, [[Muhammad Abduh|Sheikh Mohammed 'Abduh]], as well as [[Qasim Amin|Qāsim Amin]], [[Boutros Ghali]] and [[Saad Zaghloul]], to name but a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hassan |first=Fayza  |title=A Spirit of Enchantment |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/455/bk1_455.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611042237/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/455/bk1_455.htm |archivedate=Jun 11, 2008 |date=11–17 November 1999 |work= [[Al-Ahram Weekly]] Online |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Dawn of Syria (Beirut)===

In 1880, the Lebanese writer Maryam Nimr Makariyus established the Dawn of Syria literary society in [[Beirut]].&lt;ref name=zeidan-46-49/&gt;

===The Association of the Arab Women Awakening (Beirut)===

This literary society was founded by Muslim women in Beirut in 1914.&lt;ref name=zeidan-46-49/&gt;

===Katy Antonius' Salon (Jerusalem)===
Katy Antonius ran what has been described as 'the focal point of [[Jerusalem]] social life'&lt;ref&gt;Obituary for Katy Antonius, ''[[The Times]]'', 8 December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; from the home she shared with her husband - the celebrated Arab nationalist, [[George Antonius]] - during the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate]] period. The salon provided local journalists, officials, officers, politicians and European diplomats with an opportunity to network and discuss the latest literary, social and political issues. Her parties have been described as 'elaborate affairs' with 'evening dress, Syrian food and drink, and dancing on the marble floor.'&lt;ref name=bird&gt;{{cite news |last=Bird |first=Kai |title=Excerpt: Pen Portraits from a Forgotten Middle East |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/04/27/pen_portraits_from_a_forgotten_middle_east?page=full |date=April 27, 2010 |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From time to time Antonius invited the boys from her orphanage to her salon evenings, as well as her array of famous guests.&lt;ref name=bird/&gt;

===Mayy Ziyadah's Salon (Cairo)===

Shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, [[May Ziade|Mayy Ziyadah]] began to host well-known men and women from intellectual, literary and political circles across the Arab world. Meetings were held at her family home,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--pages?--&gt;{{cite book |last=Brugman |first=J. |year=1984 |title=An Introduction to the History of Modern Arabic Literature in Egypt |series="Studies in Arabic literature", '''10''' |location=Leiden |publisher=E.J.Brill |isbn=90-04-07172-5 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first salon in Cairo in which men and women met together in the same room.&lt;ref&gt;Badran, 1996, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooke |first=Miriam |year=1996 |title=War's Other Voices: Women Writers on the Lebanese Civil War |series="Gender, culture, and politics in the Middle East" |location=Syracuse, New York |publisher=Syracuse University Press |isbn=  0-8156-0377-0 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of etiquette, Ziyadah maintained a 'tactful correspondence' with guests of her salon, who were expected to inform her of their attendance through letters as a matter of courtesy. She and her guests also published letters they wrote from conversations in the salon.&lt;ref&gt;Khaldi, 2008, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

A Syrian Christian journalist, Salim Sarkis, a typical representative of the educated middle class clientele who used to frequent the gatherings, attended Ziyadah's salon, which was held on Tuesday evenings for twenty-three years, 1913–1936. The influence of Ziyadah's time spent in the salons of France is obvious, with Sarkis comparing her to notable French "salonnières". The journalist gives the reader a rare insight into the atmosphere of the salon in the following description:

{{quote|In the evening of every Tuesday the house of Mr Ilyas Ziyadah, the owner of ''Al-Mahrusah'' newspaper, turns into a luxurious house in Paris, and his daughter Mayy, the Syrian young woman who is still in her twenties, into [[Germaine de Staël|Madame de Staël]], [[Juliette Récamier|Madame Récamier]], [[A'ishah Al-Ba'uniyyah]], [[Wallada bint al-Mustakfi|Walladah bint Al-Mustakfi]] and Wardah Al-Yaziji. Mayy Ziyadah's salon turns into an 'Ukaz fair [an annual fair in pre-Islamic Mecca, where the likes of [[Al-Khansa]] and other literary greats recited poetry] where literary, philosophic and scientific ideas propagate.&lt;ref name="Khaldi 2008 p. 58"/&gt;}}

The salon evenings ended after her mother's death in 1932, as social pressure would not permit an unmarried woman to enjoy the company of men without members of her family present.&lt;ref name=khaldi-p103&gt;Khaldi, 2008 p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; A eulogy by Syrian poet [[Khalil Mutran]] mourned Ziyadah's death and the passing of her salon:

{{quote|Oh Mayy! The house was deserted, where is your salon which visitors frequented? / The best elite of the East and West in nobility and erudition seek protection under your boundless wing...&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Khaldi, 2008, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Huda Sha'arawi's Salon (Cairo / Beirut)===
[[Huda Shaarawi|Sha`arawi's]] salon only met sporadically, but was well-attended by many famous political figures and intellectuals; including [[Ahmed Shawqi|Ahmad Shawqi]], Gabriel Taqlā and [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]]. She loved music, and would often play the piano long into the night whilst in her salon. Sha`arawi used to award a literary prize every year, and would also encourage young writers from her salon by sending them to study in Europe at her own expense.&lt;ref name=zeidan-5053/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sha`arawi, 1986, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Women's Literary Club (Damascus)===

The Damascus Women's Literary Club was founded by Mary Ajami around 1920, and was aimed at strengthening the bonds between women. It held public meetings, giving its members a platform on which to air their views on literary and political issues.&lt;ref&gt;Zeidan, 1995, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally they discussed politics, but they were mainly interested in reviving classical Arabic literature and familiarising themselves with modern Western thought. According to Joseph T. Zeidan, those who frequented the salon were treated to the melodic tones of Mary’s sister’s piano playing, as well as the insightful and witty comments of Mary herself, who was ".. highly praised for her ability to run the intellectual discourse and was acknowledged as a ‘skilled talker’".&lt;ref name=zeidan-5053/&gt;

===Sukaynah's Salon (Damascus)===

Thurayya Al-Hafez, a school teacher and popular feminist,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.syrianhistory.com/thuraya-al-hafez&lt;/ref&gt; launched a salon evening in her house in [[Damascus]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Zeidan, 1995, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The salon was named after [[Sukayna bint Husayn|Sukaynah Bint Al-Husayn]], the first Arab woman to host a salon.&lt;ref name="Zeidan, Joseph T p. 82"&gt;Zeidan, 1995, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; It was open to both men and women, though only the latter were in charge of running the proceedings. Its objectives included "...raising literary and artistic standards, creating strong bonds and cooperation among its members, publishing their works, translating Western literary works into Arabic, and translating Arabic literature into foreign languages. It continued to run until 1963, when its founder moved to Egypt.

==Pioneering women behind the salons==

* [[Maryana Marrash]] (1849-1919) was the first Arab woman in the nineteenth century to revive the tradition of the literary [[salon (gathering)|salon]] in the Arab world, with the salon she ran in her family home in Aleppo.&lt;ref name=zeidan-5053/&gt;
* [[Zaynab Fawwaz|Zaynab Fawwāz]] (?1860-1914), who founded a salon in Damascus.
* [[Princess Nazli Fadil]] (c.1884−1914)
* [[Huda Sha'arawi]] (1879–1947) became one of the most famous feminists in the Arab world. In 1914, she formed ''al-Ittihād al-Nisā'i al-Tahdhĩbĩ'' (Women's Refinement Union), where Egyptian and European came together to discuss new ideas. This led to the establishment of the ''Jami'yyat al-Ruqiyy a;-Adabiyyah li al-Sayyyidāt al-Misriyyāt'' (Egyptian Ladies Literary Improvement Society). In the 1920s, Sha`arawi began to hold regular meetings for women at her home, and from this, the Egyptian Feminist Union was born. She launched a fortnightly journal, ''L'Égyptienne'' in 1925, in order to publicise the cause.&lt;ref&gt;Khaldi, 2008, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeidan, 1995, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mayy Ziyadah]] (1886−1941) is the best known of the women associated with the literary salons, and was a leading figure in literary circles throughout the Arab world.
* [[Mary 'Ajami]] (1888−1965) founded the Damascus Women's Literary Club in 1920.
* [[Katy Antonius]] (née Nimr, d. 1984), born to Egyptian-Lebanese parents, experienced a privileged upbringing and education in Alexandria as the daughter of a prominent Egyptian publisher and landowner. In 1927, she married the intellectual and Arab nationalist, [[George Antonius]]. She was a fashionable socialite known for her wit, humour, kindness, and charm; as well as her infamous parties and salon evenings. As well as her salon, Antonius established a boys' orphanage in Old Jerusalem called Dar al-Awlad.&lt;ref name=bird/&gt;
* [[Thuraya Al-Hafez]] (1911-2000) 'launched her own literary and political salon in Damascus, which was open to both genders. The salon was convened in her own house and was named after Sukayna bint al-Hussein, the great-granddaughter of Prophet Muhammad, who presided over the first literary salon in Muslim history'.&lt;ref&gt;Ghada Talhami, ''Historical Dictionary of Women in the Middle East and North Africa'' (Plymouth: Scarecrow, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The salon was launched in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Sami M. Moubayed, ''Steel and Silk: Men and Women who Shaped Syria 1900-2000'' (Seattle: Cune Press, 2006), p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern-day salons==
In the 1960s, women and their ideas started to become part of the mainstream culture, and thus the important role of women-run salons declined in its importance. That said, The Women's Literary Club, which was founded by Mary 'Ajami in 1922, continues to run in Damascus, and was attended regularly by the novelist [[Ulfat Idilbi]] until her death in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Droubi, Hala. "Obituary for Ulfāt Idlibi" Forward Magazine, April 2007. Accessed on 11/24/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a new weekly salon evening for young male and female writers and literary enthusiasts was launched in the basement of a hotel in Damascus. The popular event held on Monday evenings, named Bayt al-Qasid (House of Poetry), is an opportunity for new voices rather than established poets or writers, and attracts both Syrians and foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Fahim, Kareem &amp; Mahfoud, Nawara. "Evenings of Poetry Provide a Space for New Voices" New York Times, Damascus Journal, September 19, 2010. Accessed on 11/22/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Workers' Memorial Day''', '''International Workers' Memorial Day''' or '''International Commemoration Day''' ('''ICD''') '''for Dead and Injured''' or '''[[National Day of Mourning (Canada)|Day of Mourning]]''' takes place annually around the world on April 28, an international day of remembrance and action for [[workforce|workers]] killed, disabled, injured or made unwell by their work.&lt;ref name="Manchester"&gt;[[Greater Manchester Hazards Centre]] Fact Sheet April 28, 2006 (GMHC is part of the [[Hazards Campaign]] recognised and affiliated to the UK [[Trades Union Congress]]) Author Hilda Palmer, (no ISBN); available at http://www.gmhazards.org.uk/WMDLft06.pdf Also '''Safety Express' March/ April 2006 Page 5'' 'April 28 is...Workers' Memorial Day' (no ISBN); published by The [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]] ([[ROSPA]]) UK [[registered charity]] No. 207823&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers' Memorial Day is an opportunity to highlight the preventable nature of most [[workplace accident|workplace incidents]] and ill health and to promote campaigns and union organisation in the fight for improvements in [[occupational safety and health|workplace safety]]. The slogan for the day is ''Remember the dead – Fight for the living.''&lt;ref name="Manchester"/&gt;

Although April 28 is used as the focal point for remembrance and a day of international [[solidarity]], campaigning and other related activities continue throughout the year right around the world.

==Origins==
[[File:WMD ribbon.jpg|thumb|Workers' Memorial Day ribbon]]
In 1970, the [[AFL-CIO]] declared April 28 “Workers' Memorial Day” to honour the hundreds of thousands of working people killed and injured on the job every year. Following the passage of the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]] by the U.S. Congress in 1970, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] was formed in 1971.  In 1984, the [[Canadian Union of Public Employees]] (CUPE) did the same in Canada. The [[Canadian Labour Congress]] declared an annual day of remembrance in 1985 on April 28, which is the anniversary of a comprehensive Workers' Compensation Act (refer to the entry [[Workplace Safety &amp; Insurance Board]]), passed in 1914.  In 1991, the [[Canadian parliament]] passed an Act respecting a [[National Day of Mourning (Canada)|National Day of Mourning]] for persons killed or injured in the workplace, making April 28 an official Workers’ Mourning Day.&lt;ref name="Manchester"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ohs"&gt;[http://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/index.cfm?mins=293 TUC Certificate in Occupational Health &amp; Safety course notes 2004/5 Section C page 69] (no ISBN).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==International recognition==
For years Workers' Memorial Day events have been organised in North America, and then worldwide.  Since 1989, trade unions in [[North America]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] have organised events on April 28.  The late [[Hazards Campaign]]er Tommy Harte brought Workers' Memorial Day to the UK in 1992 as a day to ''‘Remember the Dead: Fight for the Living’. ''  In the UK the campaign for Workers’ Memorial Day has been championed by the [[Hazards Campaign]] and taken up by trade unions, adopted by [[Scotland]]'s [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] in 1993, followed by the TUC in 1999 and the [[Health and Safety Commission]] and [[Health and Safety Executive]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="Manchester"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ohs"/&gt;

April 28 is recognised by the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) and the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC) as International Workers' Memorial Day.  In 1996 the ICFTU commemorated Workers' Memorial Day and began to set annual 'themes'.  For 2006 the ICFTU theme was ''Union workplaces: safer workplaces'', focusing on a global ban on [[asbestos]] and increased awareness of HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Union Workplaces"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.global-unions.org/pdf/ohsewpH_3e.EN.pdf |title=Union Workplaces – Safer Workplaces |date=April 28, 2006 |accessdate=April 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During 2001 the [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], part of the United Nations, recognised Workers' Memorial Day and declared it '''''World Day for Safety and Health at Work''''' and in 2002 the ILO announced that April 28 should be an official day in the United Nations system.&lt;ref name="Manchester"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ohs"/&gt;

Workers' Memorial Day is recognised as a national day in many countries including: [[Australia]], [[Argentina]], [[Belgium]], [[Bermuda]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Ireland]],  [[Luxembourg]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Thailand]], [[Taiwan]], [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Trade unions in other countries including [[Benin]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], [[Malta]], [[Nepal]], [[New Zealand]], [[Romania]] and [[Singapore]] are pursuing government recognition.&lt;ref name="Manchester"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ohs"/&gt;

Workers’ Memorial Day is now an international day of remembrance of workers killed in incidents at work, or by diseases caused by work, and annually on  April 28, Workers' Memorial Day events are held throughout the world. Some examples include active campaigning, and workplace awareness events. Public events include speeches, multi-faith religious services, laying wreaths, planting trees, unveiling monuments, [[balloon release]]s, [[raising awareness|raising public awareness]] of issues and laying out empty shoes to symbolise those who have died at work.

'''World Day for Safety and Health at Work''' is a [[UNRIC#UN international days and observances|UN international day]] that is celebrated every April 28. It is concerned about safe work and awareness of the dimensions and consequences of work-related accidents and diseases; to place occupational safety and health (OSH) on the international and national agendas; and to provide support to the national efforts for the improvement of national OSH systems and programmes in line with relevant [[international labour standards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/safework/lang--en/index.htm Programme on Safety and Health at Work and the Environment (SafeWork)] –  [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 World Day for Safety and Health at Work focuses on the implementation of an Occupational Safety and Health Management System (OSHMS) as a tool for continual improvement in the prevention of workplace incidents and accidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/safework/events/meetings/lang--en/WCMS_153617/index.htm World Day for Safety and Health at Work – 28 April 2011] – [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)]] conducts research and makes recommendations to prevent work-related injury, illness, and death. Additionally, NIOSH collaborates with other federal agencies, academic institutions, industry, and labour and professional organisations to move research into effective injury and illness prevention practices. As part of its national effort to protect workers from injury and illness, and in conjunction with Workers’ Memorial Day efforts globally, NIOSH contributes relevant data, case reports, and other findings from its surveillance and research activities to the [[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)]] prepared and published by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]].
