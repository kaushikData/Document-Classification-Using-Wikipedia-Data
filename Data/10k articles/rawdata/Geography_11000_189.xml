In the Middle Ages, the Arab world was synonymous with the historic Arab empires and [[caliphate]]s. [[Arab nationalism]] arose in the second half of the 19th century along with other [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|nationalist]] movements within the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab League was formed in 1945 to represent the interests of Arab people and especially to pursue the political unification of the Arab countries; a project known as [[Pan-Arabism]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-113946363.html |title=Arab League Sends Delegation to Iraq |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date=8 October 2005 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-113950671.html |title=Arab League Warns of Civil War in Iraq |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date=8 October 2005 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The linguistic and political denotation inherent in the term ''[[Arab people|Arab]]'' is generally dominant over [[genealogical]] considerations. In Arab states, [[Modern Standard Arabic]] is the only language used by the government. The language of an individual nation is called [[Darija]], which means "everyday/colloquial language."&lt;ref&gt;Wehr, Hans: ''Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic'' (2011); Harrell, Richard S.: ''Dictionary of Moroccan Arabic'' (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; Darija shares the majority of its vocabulary with standard Arabic, but it also significantly borrows from Berber (Tamazight) substrates,&lt;ref&gt;Tilmatine Mohand, Substrat et convergences: Le berbére et l'arabe nord-africain (1999), in Estudios de dialectologia norteaafricana y andalusi 4, pp 99–119&lt;/ref&gt; as well as extensively from French, the language of the historical colonial occupier of the [[Maghreb]]. Darija is spoken and, to various extents, mutually understood in the Maghreb countries, especially Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, but it is unintelligible to speakers of other Arabic dialects, mainly for those in Egypt and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ary|title=Arabic, Moroccan Spoken|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard territorial definition===
{{main|Arab League}}
Although no globally accepted definition of the Arab world exists,&lt;ref name="Frishkopf"/&gt; all countries that are [[Member states of the Arab League|members]] of the [[Arab League]] are generally acknowledged as being part of the Arab world.&lt;ref name="Frishkopf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hätinger"&gt;Benjamin Hätinger, ''The League of Arab States'', (GRIN Verlag: 2009), p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab League is a [[regional organisation]] that aims (among other things) to consider in a general way the affairs and interests of the Arab countries and sets out the following definition of an Arab:
{{quote|An Arab is a person whose language is Arabic, who lives in an Arabic country, and who is in sympathy with the aspirations of the Arabic people.&lt;ref&gt;Dwight Fletcher Reynolds, ''Arab folklore'': a handbook, (Greenwood Press: 2007), p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This standard territorial definition is sometimes seen to be inappropriate&lt;ref&gt;Baumann: 8&lt;/ref&gt; or problematic,&lt;ref&gt;Deng: 405&lt;/ref&gt; and may be supplemented with certain additional elements (see ancillary linguistic definition below).&lt;ref name="Kronholm"&gt;Kronholm: 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancillary linguistic definition===
{{Main|Arabic language}}

As an alternative to,&lt;ref&gt;Rejwan: 52&lt;/ref&gt; or in combination with,&lt;ref name="Frishkopf"&gt;Frishkopf: 61: "No universally accepted definition of 'the Arab world' exists, but it is generally assumed to include the twenty-two countries belonging to the Arab League that have a combined population of about 280 million (Seib 2005, 604). For the purposes of this introduction, this territorial definition is combined with a linguistic one (use of the Arabic language, or its recognition as critical to identity), and thereby extended into multiple diasporas, especially the Americas, Europe, Southeast Asia, West Africa, and Australia."&lt;/ref&gt; the standard territorial definition, the Arab world may be defined as consisting of peoples and states united to at least some degree by Arabic language, culture or geographic contiguity,&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan and Ismael: ix&lt;/ref&gt; or those states or territories in which the majority of the population speaks Arabic, and thus may also include [[Arab diaspora|populations of the Arab diaspora]].&lt;ref name="Frishkopf"/&gt;

When an ancillary linguistic definition is used in combination with the [[Arab world#Standard territorial definition|standard territorial definition]], various parameters may be applied{{Clarify|this sounds [[WP:OR]]. The language must be changed or a very reliable source added|date=June 2015}} to determine whether a state or territory should be included in this alternative definition of the Arab world. These parameters may be applied{{Clarify|sounds [[WP:OR]]|date=June 2015}} to the states and territories of the Arab League (which constitute the Arab world under the standard definition) and to other states and territories. Typical parameters that may be applied include: whether Arabic is widely spoken; whether Arabic is an official or national language; or whether an Arabic cognate language is widely spoken.

While [[Arabic dialects]] are spoken in a number of Arab League states, [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] is official in all of them. Several states have declared Arabic to be an [[List of countries where Arabic is an official language|official or national language]], although Arabic is today not as widely spoken there. As members of the Arab League, however, they are considered part of the Arab world under the standard territorial definition.

[[Somalia]] has two official languages today, Arabic and [[Somali language|Somali]], both of which belong to the larger [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language family. Although Arabic is widely spoken by many people in the north and urban areas in the south, Somali is the most widely used language, and contains many Arabic [[loan word]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Briton Putman, Mohamood Cabdi Noor, ''The Somalis: their history and culture'', (Center for Applied Linguistics: 1993), p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Djibouti]] has two official languages, Arabic and [[French language|French]]. It also has several formally recognized national languages; besides Somali, many people speak [[Afar language|Afar]], which is also an Afro-Asiatic language. The majority of the population speaks Somali and Afar, although Arabic is also widely used for trade and other activities.&lt;ref name="Legum"&gt;Colin Legum, ''Africa contemporary record: annual survey and documents'', Volume 13, (Africana Pub. Co.: 1985), p.B-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Comoros]] has three official languages: Arabic, [[Comorian language|Comorian]] and French. Comorian is the most widely spoken language, with Arabic having a religious significance, and French being associated with the educational system.

[[Chad]], [[Eritrea]]&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{CIA World Factbook link|er|Eritrea|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Israel]] all recognize Arabic as an official language, but none of them is a member-state of the Arab League, although both Chad and Eritrea are observer states of the League (with possible future membership) and have large populations of Arabic speakers.

Israel is not part of the Arab world. By some definitions,&lt;ref name="Kronholm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rinnawi: xvi&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arab citizens of Israel]] may concurrently be considered a constituent part of the Arab world.

[[Iran]] has about 1.5 million Arabic speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle East {{ndash}} Iran |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |work=[[The World Factbook]] |accessdate=24 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203093100/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |archivedate=3 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iranian Arabs]] are mainly found in [[Ahvaz]], a southwestern region in the [[Khuzestan Province]]; others inhabit the [[Bushehr Province|Bushehr]] and [[Hormozgan Province|Hormozgan]] provinces and the city of [[Qom]]. [[Mali]] and [[Senegal]] recognize [[Hassaniya]], the Arabic dialect of the [[Moors|Moorish]] ethnic minority, as a [[national language]].&lt;ref name="Hassaniyya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=mey |title=Hassaniyya - A language of Mauritania |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]] also recognize [[Cypriot Maronite Arabic]] under the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. Additionally, Malta, though not part of the Arab world, has as its official language [[Maltese language|Maltese]]. The language is grammatically akin to Maghrebi Arabic.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of the Arab League}}
In the Arab world, [[Modern Standard Arabic]], derived from [[Classical Arabic]] (symptomatic of Arabic [[diglossia]]), serves as an official language in the Arab League states, and [[varieties of Arabic|Arabic dialects]] are used as lingua franca. Various indigenous languages are also spoken, which predate the spread of the Arabic language. This contrasts with the situation in the wider [[Islamic world]], where, in contiguous Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, the [[Perso-Arabic script]] is used and Arabic is the primary liturgical language, but the tongue is not official at the state level or spoken as a [[vernacular]].

[[Arabs]] constitute around one quarter of the 1.5 billion [[Muslim]]s in the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Many Muslims Are There in the World?|url=http://islam.about.com/od/muslimcountries/a/population.htm|website=About.com Religion &amp; Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The majority of people in the Arab world adhere to [[Islam]], and the religion has official status in most countries. [[Shariah]] law exists partially in the legal system in some countries (especially in the [[Arabian peninsula]]), while others are legislatively [[secularism|secular]]. The majority of the Arab countries adhere to [[Sunni Islam]]. [[Iraq]] and [[Bahrain]], however, are [[Shia Islam|Shia]] majority countries, while [[Lebanon]], [[Yemen]], and [[Kuwait]] have large Shia minorities. In [[Saudi Arabia]], Ismailite pockets are also found in the eastern Al-Hasa region and the southern city of Najran. [[Ibadi]] Islam is practiced in [[Oman]], where Ibadis constitute around 75% of Muslims.

There are also some [[Christianity|Christian]] adherents in the Arab world, particularly in [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]. [[Coptic Church|Coptic]], [[Maronite Church|Maronite]] and [[Assyrian Christian]] enclaves exist in the Nile Valley, Levant and northern Iraq respectively. There are also  numbers of [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]], [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Terms for Syriac Christians|Syriac]]-[[Aramean]] and [[Arab Christians]] throughout Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan,  many of which have diminished due to various regional conflicts.

Smaller ethno-religious minorities across the Arab League include the [[Yezidis]], [[Yarsan]] and [[Shabak people|Shabaks]] (mainly in Iraq), the [[Druze]]s (mainly in Syria and also in Lebanon, Jordan) and [[Mandaeans]] (in Iraq). Formerly, there were significant minorities of [[Jews]] throughout the Arab World. However, the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] prompted their mass [[Jewish exodus from Arab countries|exodus]] between 1948–72. Today small Jewish communities remain, ranging anywhere from just 10 in [[Bahrain]], to more than 1,000 in [[Tunisia]] and some 3,000 in [[Morocco]].

Historically, [[History of slavery in the Muslim world|slavery in the Muslim world]] developed out of [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] [[Arab slave trade|practices of slavery in the Arab world]].&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Lewis 1994, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html Ch.1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''Race and Color in Islam,'' Harper and Yuow, 1970, quote on page 38. The brackets are displayed by Lewis.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
According to [[UNESCO]], the average rate of [[adult literacy]] (ages 15 and older) in this region [[List of countries by literacy rate|is 76.9%]]. In Mauritania and Yemen, the rate is lower than the average, at barely over 50%. On the other hand, [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Jordan]] record a high adult literacy rate of over 90%.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The average rate of adult literacy shows steady improvement, and the absolute number of adult illiterates fell from 64 million to around 58 million between 1990 and 2000-2004. Overall, the gender disparity in adult literacy is high in this region, and of the illiteracy rate, women account for two-thirds, with only 69 literate women for every 100 literate men. The average GPI (Gender Parity Index) for adult literacy is 0.72, and gender disparity can be observed in Egypt, Morocco, and Yemen. Above all, the GPI of Yemen is only 0.46 in a 53% adult literacy rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001489/148972E.pdf | title=Regional overview: Arab States | publisher=UNESCO | year=2007 | accessdate=6 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a UN survey, in the Arab world, the average person reads four pages a year and one new title is published each year for every 12,000 people.&lt;ref name=RIA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20081111/118255514.html |title=Average Arab reads 4 pages a year |author=RIA Novosti |date=11 November 2008 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arab Thought Foundation]] reports that just above 8% of people in Arab countries aspire to get an education.&lt;ref name=RIA/&gt;

Literacy rate is higher among the [[Youth in the Arab world|youth]] than adults. Youth literacy rate (ages 15–24) in the Arab region increased from 63.9 to 76.3% from 1990 to 2002. The average rate of GCC States *[https://web.archive.org/web/20161004140510/http://arabwindow.net/cat/gulf/ Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC)]

[[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC)]] was 94%, followed by the [[Maghreb]] at 83.2% and the [[Mashriq]] at 73.6%.

The [[United Nations]] published an [[Arab human development report]] in 2002, 2003 and 2004. These reports, written by researchers from the Arab world, address some sensitive issues in the development of Arab countries: women empowerment, availability of education and information among others.

===Gender equality===
[[Women]] in the Arab world are still denied [[gender equality|equality of opportunity]], although their disenfranchisement is a critical factor crippling the Arab nations' quest to return to the first rank of global leaders in commerce, learning and culture, according to a [[United Nations]]-sponsored report in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-joussour.net/en/node/1511 Gender equality in Arab world critical for progress and prosperity, UN report warns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906120412/http://www.e-joussour.net/en/node/1511 |date=6 September 2015 }}, E-joussour (21 October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early history===
{{further|Arabization}}
[[File:Great Mosque of Kairouan Panorama - Grande Mosquée de Kairouan Panorama.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|right|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] (also called the Mosque of Uqba), was founded in 670 by the Arab general and conqueror Uqba ibn Nafi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=kairouan+oldest+mosques+arab+world&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=VaXfTcrBINDxsgboprDKBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Hans Kung, '&amp;#39;Tracing the Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions'&amp;#39;, éd. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006, p. 248 |publisher=Books.google.fr |date=31 August 2006 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] is located in the historic city of [[Kairouan]] in [[Tunisia]].]]

The [[Arab people|Arabs]] historically originate as a [[Central Semitic languages|Central Semitic]] group in the [[Arabian peninsula]]. Their expansion beyond Arabia and the [[Syrian desert]] is due to the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th and 8th centuries. [[Mesopotamia]] (modern Iraq) was conquered in 633, [[Levant]] (modern Syria, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon and tine) between 636 and 640 CE.

[[History of Muslim Egypt|Egypt]] was conquered in 639, and gradually Arabized during the medieval period. A distinctively [[Egyptian Arabic]] language emerged by the 16th century.

The [[Maghreb]] was also conquered in the 7th century, and gradually Arabized under the [[Fatimids]].
Islam was brought to [[Sudan]] from Egypt during the 8th to 11th centuries.

The culture of Sudan today depends on the tribe, some have a pure Nubian, [[Beja people|Beja]], or Arabic culture and some have a mixture of Arab and [[Nubian people|Nubian]] elements.&lt;ref&gt;Bechtold, Peter R (1991). "More Turbulence in Sudan" in ''Sudan: State and Society in Crisis''. ed. John Voll ([[Westview Press]] (Boulder)) p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman and colonial rule===
The Arab [[Abbasid Caliphate]] fell to the [[Mongol invasions]] in the 13th century. Egypt, the Levant and Hejaz also came under the Turkish [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]].

By 1570, the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled most of the Arab world. However, [[Morocco]] remained under the rule of the [[Zenata]] [[Wattasid dynasty]], which was succeeded by the [[Saadi dynasty]] in the 16th to 17th centuries. The [[Ajuran Sultanate]] also held sway in the southern part of the Horn region.

The sentiment of [[Arab nationalism]] arose in the second half of the 19th century along with other [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|nationalisms within the declining Ottoman Empire]].

When the Ottoman Empire collapsed as a result of [[World War I]], much of the Arab world came to be controlled by the European colonial empires: [[Mandatory Palestine]], [[Mandatory Iraq]], [[British protectorate of Egypt]], [[French protectorate of Morocco]], [[Italian Libya]], [[French occupation of Tunisia|French Tunisia]], [[French colonization of Algeria|French Algeria]], [[French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon]] and the so-called [[Trucial States]], a British protectorate formed by the sheikhdoms on the former "Pirate Coast".

These Arab states only gained their independence during or after [[World War II]]: the [[Republic of Lebanon]] in 1943, the [[Syrian Arab Republic]] and the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] in 1946, the [[Kingdom of Libya]] in 1951, the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] in 1952, the [[Kingdom of Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]] in 1956, the [[Republic of Iraq]] in 1958, the [[Somali Republic]] in 1960, [[Algeria]] in 1962, and the [[United Arab Emirates]] in 1971.

By contrast, [[Saudi Arabia]] had fragmented with the fall of the Ottoman Empire, and was [[Unification of Saudi Arabia|unified]] under [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia]] by 1932.

The [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] also seceded directly from the Ottoman Empire in 1918. [[Oman]], apart from brief intermittent Persian and Portuguese rule has, been self-governing since the 8th century.

===Rise of Arab nationalism===
{{further|Islam and modernity|Arab Cold War}}
The Arab League was formed in 1945 to represent the interests of the Arabs, and especially to pursue the political unification of the Arab world, a project known as [[Pan-Arabism]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia2"/&gt;
There were some short-lived attempts at such unification in the mid-20th century, notably the [[United Arab Republic]] of 1958 to 1961.
The Arab League's main goal is to unify politically the Arab populations so defined. Its permanent headquarters are located in [[Cairo]]. However, it was moved temporarily to [[Tunis]] during the 1980s, after Egypt was expelled for signing the [[Camp David Accords (1978)]].

Pan-Arabism has mostly been abandoned as an ideology since the 1980s, and was replaced by [[Pan-Islamism]] on one hand, and individual nationalisms on the other.

===Modern conflicts===
{{main|List of modern conflicts in the Middle East}}

====Unification of Saudi Arabia====
The [[unification of Saudi Arabia]] was a 30-year-long military and political campaign, by which the various [[tribe]]s, [[sheikhdom]]s, and [[emirate]]s of most of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] were conquered by the [[House of Saud]], or ''Al Saud'', between 1902 and 1932, when the modern-day [[Saudi Arabia|Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] was proclaimed. Carried out under the charismatic [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud]], this process created what is sometimes referred to as the ''Third Saudi State'', to differentiate it from the [[First Saudi State|first]] and [[Second Saudi State|second]] states that existed under the Al Saud clan.

The Al-Saud had been in exile in [[Ottoman Iraq]] since 1893 following the disintegration of the Second Saudi State and the rise of [[Emirate of Ha'il|Jebel Shammar]] under the [[Rashidi dynasty|Al Rashid]] clan. In 1902, Ibn Saud recaptured [[Riyadh]], the Al Saud dynasty's former capital. He went on to subdue the rest of [[Nejd]], [[Al-Hasa]], [[Jebel Shammar]], [[Asir]], and [[Hejaz]] (location of the [[Islam|Muslim]] holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]) between 1913 and 1926. The resultant polity was named the [[Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz]] from 1927 until it was further consolidated with Al-Hasa and [[Qatif]] into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932.

====Arab–Israeli conflict====
{{further|Arab–Israeli conflict}}
The establishment of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948 has given rise to the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], one of the major [[ongoing conflicts|unresolved geopolitical conflicts]].

The Arab states in changing alliances were involved in a number of wars with Israel and its western allies between 1948 and 1973, including the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, and the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973.
An [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]] was signed in 1979.

====Iraq–Iran War====
{{main|Iran–Iraq War}}
The [[Iran–Iraq War]] (also known as the First Gulf War and by various other names) was an armed conflict between the armed forces of Iraq and Iran, lasting from September 1980 to August 1988, making it the second longest conventional war of the 20th century. It was initially referred to in English as the "Gulf War" prior to the "Gulf War" of 1990.

The war began when Iraq invaded Iran, launching a simultaneous invasion by air and land into Iranian territory on 22 September 1980 following a long history of border disputes, and fears of Shia Islam insurgency among Iraq's long-suppressed Shia majority influenced by the Iranian Revolution. Iraq was also aiming to replace Iran as the dominant Persian Gulf state. Although Iraq hoped to take advantage of the revolutionary chaos in Iran (see [[Iranian Revolution]], 1979) and attacked without formal warning, they made only limited progress into Iran and were quickly repelled by the Iranians who regained virtually all lost territory by June 1982. For the next six years, Iran was on the offensive.

====Lebanese Civil War====
{{main|Lebanese Civil War}}
The [[Lebanese Civil War]] was a multifaceted civil war in Lebanon, lasting from 1975 to 1990 and resulting in an estimated 120,000 fatalities. Another one million people (a quarter of the population) were wounded,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} and today approximately 76,000 people remain displaced within Lebanon. There was also a mass exodus of almost one million people from Lebanon.

====Western Sahara conflict====
{{main|Western Sahara conflict}}
The [[Western Sahara War]] was an armed struggle between the Sahrawi Polisario Front and Morocco between 1975 and 1991, being the most significant phase of the Western Sahara conflict. The conflict erupted after the withdrawal of Spain from the Spanish Sahara in accordance with the Madrid Accords, by which it transferred administrative control of the territory to Morocco and Mauritania, but not the sovereignty. In 1975, Moroccan government organized the Green March of some 350,000 Moroccan citizens, escorted by around 20,000 troops, who entered Western Sahara, trying to establish Moroccan presence. While at first met with just minor resistance by the Polisario, Morocco later engaged a long period of guerilla warfare with the Sahrawi nationalists. During the late 1970s, the Polisario Front, desiring to establish an independent state in the territory, successively fought both Mauritania and Morocco. In 1979, Mauritania withdrew from the conflict after signing a peace treaty with the Polisario. The war continued in low intensity throughout the 1980s, though Morocco made several attempts to take the upper hand in 1989-1991. A cease-fire agreement was finally reached between the Polisario Front and Morocco in September 1991.

====North Yemen Civil War====
{{main|North Yemen Civil War}}
The [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in North Yemen between royalists of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen and factions of the Yemen Arab Republic from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a coup d'état carried out by the republican leader, Abdullah as-Sallal, which dethroned the newly crowned Imam al-Badr and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the Saudi Arabian border and rallied popular support.

====Somali Civil War====
{{main|Somali Civil War}}
The [[Somali Civil War]] is an ongoing civil war taking place in [[Somalia]]. It began in 1991, when a coalition of clan-based armed opposition groups ousted the nation's long-standing military government.

Various factions began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed, which precipitated an aborted UN peacekeeping attempt in the mid-1990s. A period of decentralization ensued, characterized by a return to customary and religious law in many areas as well as the establishment of autonomous regional governments in the northern part of the country. The early 2000s saw the creation of fledgling interim federal administrations, culminating in the establishment of the [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) in 2004. In 2006, the TFG, assisted by Ethiopian troops, assumed control of most of the nation's southern conflict zones from the newly formed [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU). The ICU subsequently splintered into more radical groups, notably [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]], which have since been fighting the Somali government and its [[AMISOM]] allies for control of the region. In 2011, a coordinated military operation between the Somali military and multinational forces began, which is believed to represent one of the final stages in the war's Islamist insurgency.&lt;ref name="Eanbkois2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/East-African-Nations-Back-Kenyan-Offensive-in-Somalia-132374053.html|agency=Voice of America|title=E. African Nations Back Kenyan Offensive in Somalia|first=Peter|last=Heinlein|date=22 October 2011|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arab Spring====
{{Main|Arab Spring|Libyan Civil War|Syrian Civil War}}
The [[Arab Spring|popular protests throughout the Arab world]] of late 2010 to the present have been directed against authoritarian leadership and associated [[political corruption]], paired with demands for more democratic rights. The two most violent and prolonged conflicts in the aftermath of the Arab Spring are the Libyan Civil War and Syrian Civil War.

===Petroleum===
While the Arab world had been of limited interest to the European colonial powers, the [[British Empire]] being mostly interested in the [[Suez Canal]] as a route to [[British India]], the economic and geopolitical situation changed dramatically after the discovery of large [[petroleum]] deposits in the 1930s, coupled with the vastly increased demand for petroleum in the west as a result of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]].

The [[Persian Gulf]] is particularly well-endowed with this strategic [[raw material]]: five Persian Gulf states, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, Kuwait, and Qatar, are among the top ten petroleum or gas exporters worldwide. In Africa, Algeria (10th world) and Libya are important gas exporters. In addition Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia, and Sudan all have smaller but significant reserves. Where present, these have had significant effects on regional politics, often enabling [[rentier state]]s, leading to economic disparities between oil-rich and oil-poor countries, and, particularly in the more sparsely populated states of the Persian Gulf and Libya, triggering extensive labor immigration. It is believed that the Arab world holds approximately 46% of the world’s total proven oil reserves and a quarter of the world's natural-gas reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21580630-even-rich-arab-countries-cannot-squander-their-resources-indefinitely-haves-and|title=The haves and the have-nots|publisher=|via=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamism]] and [[Pan-Islamism]] were on the rise during the 1980s. The [[Hezbollah]], a militant Islamic party in [[Lebanon]], was founded in 1982.
[[Islamic terrorism]] became a problem in the Arab world in the 1970s to 1980s. While the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] had been active in Egypt since 1928, their militant actions were limited to assassination attempts on political leaders.

===Recent history===
Today, Arab states are characterized by their [[autocratic ruler]]s and [[Democracy in the Middle East|lack of democratic control]]. The 2016 ''[[Democracy Index]]'' classifies [[Lebanon]], [[Iraq]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] as "hybrid regimes", [[Tunisia]] as a "flawed democracy" and all other Arab states as "authoritarian regimes". Similarly, the 2011 [[Freedom House]] report classifies [[Comoros]] and [[Mauritania]] as "[[Electoral democracy|electoral democracies]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&amp;year=2008 |title=Freedom House Country Report |publisher=Freedomhouse.org |date=10 May 2004 |accessdate=13 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510005050/http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&amp;year=2008 |archivedate=10 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lebanon]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Morocco]] as "partly free", and all other Arab states as "not free".

The invasion of Kuwait by Iraq forces, led to the 1990–91 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. [[Egypt]], [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] joined a multinational coalition that opposed Iraq. Displays of support for Iraq by [[Jordan]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] resulted in strained relations between many of the Arab states. After the war, a so-called "Damascus Declaration" formalized an alliance for future joint Arab defensive actions between Egypt, Syria, and the GCC states.&lt;ref&gt;Egypt's Bid for Arab Leadership: Implications for U.S. Policy, By Gregory L. Aftandilian, Published by Council on Foreign Relations, 1993, {{ISBN|0-87609-146-X}}, pages 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;

A chain of events leading to the destabilization of the authoritarian regimes established during the 1950s throughout the Arab world became apparent during the early years of the 21st century. The [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] led to the collapse of the [[Baathist]] regime and ultimate [[execution of Saddam Hussein]].

A growing class of young, educated, secular citizens with access to modern media such as [[Al Jazeera]] (since 1996) and communicating via the [[internet]] began to form a third force besides the classical dichotomy of Pan-Arabism vs. Pan-Islamism that had dominated the second half of the 20th century.

In Syria, the [[Damascus Spring]] of 2000 to 2001 heralded the possibility of democratic change, but the Baathist regime managed to suppress the movement.

In 2003, the [[Egyptian Movement for Change]], popularly known as ''Kefaya'', was launched to oppose the [[Mubarak regime]] and to establish democratic reforms and greater [[civil liberties]] in Egypt.

==States and territories==
For the states and territories constituting the Arab world, see definition above.

===Forms of government===
Different forms of [[government]] are represented in the Arab World: Some of the countries are [[monarchy|monarchies]]: Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The other Arab countries are all [[republic]]s. With the exception of Lebanon, Tunisia, Palestine, and recently Mauritania, democratic elections throughout the Arab World are generally viewed as compromised, due to outright vote rigging, intimidation of opposition parties, and severe restraints on civil liberties and political dissent.

After [[World War II]], [[Pan-Arabism]] sought to unite all Arabic-speaking countries into one political entity. Only [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]] and [[North Yemen]] considered the short-lived unification of the [[United Arab Republic]]. Historical divisions, competing local nationalisms, and geographical sprawl were major reasons for the failure of Pan-Arabism. [[Arab Nationalism]] was another strong force in the region which peaked during the mid-20th century and was professed by many leaders in Egypt, Algeria, Libya, Syria, and Iraq. Arab Nationalist leaders of this period included [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of Egypt, [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] of Algeria, [[Michel Aflaq]], [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]], [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]], [[Constantin Zureiq]] and [[Shukri al-Kuwatli]] of Syria, [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] of Iraq, [[Habib Bourguiba]] of Tunisia, [[Mehdi Ben Barka]] of Morocco, and [[Shakib Arslan]] of Lebanon.

Later and current Arab Nationalist leaders include [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] of Libya, [[Hafez al-Assad]] and [[Bashar al-Assad]] of Syria. The diverse Arab states generally maintained close ties but distinct national identities developed and strengthened with the social, historical and political realities of the past 60 years. This has made the idea of a pan-Arab nation-state increasingly less feasible and likely. Additionally, an upsurge in political Islam has since led to a greater emphasis on pan-Islamic rather than pan-Arab identity amongst some [[Arab Muslims]]&lt;!-- and/or non-Arab Muslims too? --&gt;. Arab nationalists who once opposed Islamic movements as a threat to their power, now deal with them differently for reasons of political reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arab Nationalism: Mistaken Identity by Martin Kramer |url=http://www.geocities.com/martinkramerorg/ArabNationalism.htm |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5knIeZR5F?url=http://www.geocities.com/martinkramerorg/ArabNationalism.htm |archivedate=25 October 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern boundaries===
Many of the modern borders of the Arab World were drawn by [[Europe]]an imperial powers during the 19th and early 20th century. However, some of the larger states (in particular [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]) have historically maintained geographically definable boundaries, on which some of the modern states are roughly based. The 14th-century Egyptian historian [[Al-Maqrizi]], for instance, defines Egypt's boundaries as extending from the [[Mediterranean]] in the north to lower [[Nubia]] in the south; and between the [[Red Sea]] in the east and the oases of the Western/[[Libyan desert]]. The modern borders of Egypt, therefore, are not a creation of European powers, and are at least in part based on historically definable entities which are in turn based on certain cultural and ethnic identifications.

At other times, kings, [[emir]]s or [[sheikh]]s were placed as semi-autonomous rulers over the newly created [[nation state]]s, usually chosen by the same imperial powers that for some drew the new borders, for services rendered to European powers like [[the British Empire]], e.g. [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]]. Many African states did not attain independence until the 1960s from France after bloody insurgencies for their freedom. These struggles were settled by the imperial powers approving the form of independence given, so as a consequence almost all of these borders have remained. Some of these borders were agreed upon without consultation of those individuals that had served the colonial interests of Britain or France. One such agreement solely between Britain and France (to the exclusion of Sherif Hussein ibn Ali), signed in total secrecy until [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] released the full text, was the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]]. Another influential document written without the consensus of the local population was the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]].

As former director of the Israeli intelligence agency [[Mossad]], Efraim Halevy, now a director at the Hebrew University said,

{{cquote|The borders, which if you look on the maps of the middle-east are very straight lines, were drawn by British and French draftsmen who sat with maps and drew the lines of the frontiers with rulers. If the ruler for some reason or other moved on the map, because of some person's hand shaking, then the frontier moved (with the hand).&lt;ref name="lawac2004"&gt;[http://www.lawac.org/speech/2004-05/Halevy%202005.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206212247/http://www.lawac.org/speech/2004-05/Halevy%202005.pdf |date=6 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He went on to give an example,
{{cquote|There was a famous story about a British consul, a lady named [[Gertrude Bell]] who drew the map between Iraq and Jordan, using transparent paper. She turned to talk to somebody and as she was turning the paper moved and the ruler moved and that added considerable territory to the (new) Jordanians.&lt;ref name="lawac2004"/&gt;}}

Historian Jim Crow, of [[Newcastle University]], has said:

{{cquote|Without that imperial carve-up, Iraq would not be in the state it is in today...Gertrude Bell was one of two or three Britons who were instrumental in the creation of the Arab states in the Middle East that were favourable to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundayherald.com/31563 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=3 January 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030307134402/http://www.sundayherald.com/31563 |archivedate=7 March 2003 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Modern economies===
As of 2006, the Arab World accounts for two-fifths of the gross domestic product and three-fifths of the trade of the wider [[Muslim World]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}.

The Arab states are mostly, although not exclusively, developing economies and derive their export revenues from oil and gas, or the sale of other raw materials. Recent years have seen significant economic growth in the Arab World, due largely to an increase in oil and gas prices, which tripled between 2001 and 2006, but also due to efforts by some states to diversify their economic base. Industrial production has risen, for example the amount of steel produced between 2004 and 2005 rose from 8.4 to 19 million tonnes. (Source: Opening speech of Mahmoud Khoudri, [[Algeria|Algeria's]] Industry Minister, at the 37th General Assembly of the Iron &amp; Steel Arab Union, Algiers, May 2006). However even 19 million tons pa still only represents 1.7% of global steel production, and remains inferior to the production of countries like [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsteel.org |title=World Steel Association - Home |publisher=Worldsteel.org |date= |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main economic organisations in the Arab World are the [[Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)]], comprising the states in the Persian Gulf, and the Union of the Arab Maghreb (UMA), made up of North African States. The GCC has achieved some success in financial and monetary terms, including plans to establish a common currency in the Persian Gulf region. Since its foundation in 1989, the UMA's most significant accomplishment has been the establishment of a 7000&amp;nbsp;km highway crossing North Africa from [[Mauritania]] to [[Libya|Libya's]] border with [[Egypt]]. The central stretch of the highway, expected to be completed in 2010, will cross [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]]. In recent years a new term has been coined to define a greater economic region: the MENA region (standing for Middle East and North Africa) is becoming increasingly popular, especially with support from the current US administration.

As of August 2009 it was reported that Saudi Arabia is the strongest Arab economy according to World Bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoprod.co.il/article/2/283 World Bank: Saudi Arabia, strongest Arab economy]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130182205/http://www.infoprod.co.il/article/2/283 |date=30 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saudi Arabia]] remains the top Arab economy in terms of total GDP. It is Asia's eleventh largest economy, followed by [[Egypt]] and [[Algeria]], which were also the second and third largest economies in Africa (after [[South Africa]]), in 2006. In terms of GDP per capita, [[Qatar]] is the richest developing country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;CIA [[World Factbook]], GDP by country classification&lt;/ref&gt;

The total GDP of all Arab countries in 1999 was US$531.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Lewis |first = Bernard |authorlink = Bernard Lewis |coauthors = |title = [[The Crisis of Islam]] |publisher = [[Random House]] |year = 2004 |location = New York City |page =116 |url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 978-0-8129-6785-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By grouping all the latest GDP figures, the total Arab world GDP is estimated to be worth at least $2.8 trillion in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/05/05/147980.html&lt;/ref&gt; This is only smaller than the GDP of US, China, Japan and Germany.

==Geography==
The Arab World stretches across more than {{convert|13000000|km2}} of [[North Africa]] and the part of North-East Africa and South-West Asia. The [[Asia]]n part of the Arab world is called the ''[[Mashriq]]''. Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and often Mauritania are the ''[[Maghreb]]'' or ''Maghrib'', while Egypt and Sudan are referred to as ''[[Nile Valley]]'', Egypt is a [[transcontinental country]] by virtue of the [[Sinai Peninsula]], which is in [[Asia]].
[[File:Magrib.png|thumb|right|The ''[[Maghreb]]'' (Western Arab world)]]
The term "Arab" often connotes the Middle East, but the larger (and more populous) part of the Arab World is North Africa. Its eight million square kilometers include two of the largest countries of the African continent, [[Algeria]] (2.4 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the center of the region and [[Sudan]] (1.9 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the southeast. Algeria is about three-quarters the size of [[India]], or about one-and-a-half times the size of [[Alaska]], the largest state in the United States. The largest country in the Arab Middle East is [[Saudi Arabia]] (2 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

At the other extreme, the smallest autonomous mainland Arab country in North Africa and the Middle East is [[Lebanon]] (10,452&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and the smallest island Arab country is [[Bahrain]] (665&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Notably, every Arab country borders a sea or ocean, with the exception of the Arab region of northern Chad, which is completely landlocked. Iraq is actually nearly landlocked, as it has only a very narrow access to the Persian Gulf.

===Historical boundaries===
The political borders of the Arab world have wandered, leaving Arab minorities in non-Arab countries of the [[Sahel]] and the [[Horn of Africa]] as well as in the Middle Eastern countries of [[Cyprus]], [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]], and also leaving non-Arab minorities in Arab countries. However, the basic geography of sea, desert and mountain provides the enduring natural boundaries for this region.

[[File:Abbasids Dynasty 750 - 1258 (AD).PNG|thumb|right|[[Abbasid caliphate]] (750 - 1258 CE)]]
The Arab world straddles two continents, Africa and Asia. It is mainly oriented along an east-west axis.

====Arab Africa====
Arab Africa comprises the entire northern third of the continent. It is surrounded by water on three sides (west, north, and east) and desert or desert scrubland on the fourth (south).

In the west, it is bounded by the shores of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. From northeast to southwest, [[Morocco]], [[Western Sahara]] ([[Southern Provinces|mostly]] unilaterally [[annexation|annexed]] by Morocco), and [[Mauritania]] make up the roughly 2,000 kilometers of Arab Atlantic coastline. The southwestern sweep of the coast is gentle but substantial, such that Mauritania's capital, [[Nouakchott]] (18°N, 16°W), is far enough west to share longitude with [[Iceland]] (13–22°W). Nouakchott is the westernmost capital of the Arab World and the third-westernmost in Africa, and sits on the Atlantic fringe of the southwestern Sahara. Next south along the coast from Mauritania is [[Senegal]], whose abrupt border belies the gradient in culture from Arab to indigenous African that historically characterizes this part of [[West Africa]].

Arab Africa's boundary to the north is again a continental boundary, the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. This boundary begins in the west with the narrow [[Strait of Gibraltar]], the thirteen kilometer wide channel that connects the Mediterranean with the Atlantic to the west, and separates Morocco from [[Spain]] to the north. East along the coast from Morocco are Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, followed by Egypt, which forms the region's (and the continent's) northeastern corner. The coast turns briefly but sharply south at Tunisia, slopes more gently southeastward through the Libyan capital of [[Tripoli]], and bumps north through Libya's second city, [[Benghazi]], before turning straight east again through Egypt's second city, [[Alexandria]], at the mouth of the Nile. Along with the spine of [[Italy]] to its north, Tunisia thus marks the junction of western and eastern Mediterranean, and a cultural transition as well: west of Egypt begins the region of the Arab World known as the [[Maghreb]] include (Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania).

Historically the 4,000-kilometer Mediterranean boundary has fluttered. Population centers north of it in [[Europe]] have invited contact and Arab exploration—mostly friendly, though sometimes not. Islands and peninsulas near the Arab coast have changed hands. The islands of [[Sicily]] and [[Malta]] lie just a hundred kilometers east of the Tunisian city of [[Carthage]], which has been a point of contact with Europe since its founding in the first millennium BCE; both Sicily and Malta at times have been part of the Arab World. Just across the Strait of Gibraltar from Morocco, regions of the Iberian peninsula were part of the Arab World throughout the [[Middle Ages]], extending the northern boundary at times to the foothills of the [[Pyrenees]] and leaving a substantial mark on local and wider European and Western culture.

The northern boundary of the African Arab world has also fluttered briefly in the other direction, first through the [[Crusades]] and later through the imperial involvement of [[France]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Spain]], and [[Italy]]. Another visitor from northern shores, [[Turkey]], controlled the east of the region for centuries, though not as a colonizer. Spain still maintains two small enclaves, [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] (called "Morocco Espanol"), along the otherwise Moroccan coast. Overall this wave has ebbed, though like the Arab expansion north it has left its mark. The proximity of North Africa to Europe has always encouraged interaction, and this continues with Arab immigration to Europe and European interest in the Arab countries today. However, population centers and the physical fact of the sea keeps this boundary of the Arab World settled on the Mediterranean coastline.

To the east, the [[Red Sea]] defines the boundary between [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], and thus also between Arab Africa and the Arab Middle East. This sea is a long and narrow waterway with a northwest tilt, stretching 2,300 kilometers from [[Egypt|Egypt's]] [[Sinai peninsula]] southeast to the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] strait between [[Djibouti]] in Africa and [[Yemen]] in Arabia but on average just 150 kilometers wide. Though the sea is navigable along its length, historically much contact between Arab Africa and the Arab Middle East has been either overland across the Sinai or by sea across the Mediterranean or the narrow Bab al Mendeb strait. From northwest to southeast, Egypt, Sudan, and Eritrea form the African coastline, with Djibouti marking Bab al Mendeb's African shore.

Southeast along the coast from Djibouti is Somalia, but the Somali coast soon makes a 90-degree turn and heads northeast, mirroring a bend in the coast of Yemen across the water to the north and defining the south coast of the Gulf of Aden. The Somali coast then takes a hairpin turn back southwest to complete the horn of Africa. For six months of the year the [[monsoon]] winds blow from up equatorial Somalia, past Arabia and over the small Yemeni archipelago of [[Socotra]], to rain on [[India]]; they then switch directions and blow back. Hence the east- and especially southeast-coast boundary of Arab Africa has historically been a gateway for maritime trade and cultural exchange with both [[East Africa]] and the subcontinent. The trade winds also help explain the presence of the Comoros islands, an Arab-African country, off the coast of [[Mozambique]], near [[Madagascar]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], the southernmost part of the Arab World.

The southern boundary of Arab North Africa is the strip of scrubland known as the [[Sahel]] that crosses the continent south of the Sahara.

====Arab Middle East====
The West Asian Arab region comprises the [[Arabian Peninsula]], most of the [[Levant]] (excluding Cyprus and Israel), most of Mesopotamia (excluding parts of Turkey and Iran) and the Persian Gulf region. The peninsula is roughly a tilted rectangle that leans back against the slope of northeast Africa, the long axis pointing toward [[Turkey]] and [[Europe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15823">'''Automatic vehicle location''' ('''AVL''' or ~'''locating'''; '''telelocating''' in EU) is a means for automatically determining and transmitting the [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic location]] of a [[vehicle]].  This [[vehicle location data]], from one or more vehicles, may then be collected by a [[vehicle tracking system]] to manage an overview of vehicle travel. As of 2017, GPS technology has reached the point of having the transmitting device be smaller than the size of a human thumb (thus easier to conceal), able to run 6 months or more between battery chargings, easy to communicate with smartphones (merely requiring a duplicate SIM card from one's mobile phone carrier in most cases) — all for less than $20 USD.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Most commonly, the location is determined using [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and the transmission mechanism is SMS, [[GPRS]], or a satellite or terrestrial radio from the vehicle to a radio receiver. A single antenna unit covering all the needed frequency bands can be employed. [[GSM]] and [[Evolution Data Optimized|EVDO]] are the most common services applied, because of the low data rate needed for AVL, and the low cost and near-ubiquitous nature of these public networks. The low bandwidth requirements also allow for satellite technology to receive [[telemetry]] data at a moderately higher cost, but across a global coverage area and into very remote locations not covered well by terrestrial radio or public carriers.
Other options for determining actual location, for example in environments where GPS illumination is poor, are [[dead reckoning]], i.e. [[inertial navigation]], or active [[RFID]] systems or cooperative [[Real-time locating system|RTLS]] systems. These systems may be applied in combination in some cases. In addition, terrestrial radio positioning systems using a low frequency switched packet radio network have also been used as an alternative to GPS based systems.

== Applications ==
Automatic vehicle locating is a powerful tool for managing fleets of vehicles such as service vehicles, emergency vehicles, and public transport vehicles  such as buses and trains. It is also used to track mobile assets, such as non wheeled construction equipment, non motorized trailers, and mobile power generators.

Another purpose of tracking is to provide graded service or to manage a large driver and crewing staff effectively. For example, suppose an ambulance fleet has an objective of arriving at the location of a call for service within six minutes of receiving the request. Using an AVL system allows to evaluate the locations of all vehicles in service with drivers and other crew in order to pick the vehicle that will most likely arrive at the destination fastest, (meeting the service objective).&lt;ref&gt;One definition of AVL exists in, "Glossary," ''Arizona Phase II Final Report: Statewide Radio Interoperability Needs Assessment,'' Macro Corporation and The State of Arizona, 2004, pp. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of systems ==

=== Simple direction finding ===

[[Amateur radio]] and some cellular or [[Personal Communications Service|PCS]] wireless systems use '''direction finding or triangulation''' of transmitter signals radiated by the mobile. This is sometimes called '''radio direction finding''' or '''RDF'''. The simplest forms of these systems calculate the bearing from two fixed sites to the mobile. This creates a triangle with endpoints at the two fixed points and the mobile. Trigonometry tells you roughly where the mobile transmitter is located. In wireless telephone systems, the phones transmit continually when off-hook, making continual tracking and the collection of many location samples possible. This is one type of location system required by [[Federal Communications Commission]] Rules for wireless [[Enhanced 911]].

=== Former LORAN-based locating ===

Motorola offered a 1970s-era system based on the [[United States Coast Guard]] [[LORAN]] maritime navigation system. The LORAN system was intended for ships but signal levels on the US east- and west-coast areas were adequate for use with receivers in automobiles. The system may have been marketed under the Motorola model name ''Metricom''. It consisted of an [[Low frequency|LF]] LORAN receiver and data interface box/modem connected to a separate two-way radio. The receiver and interface calculated a latitude and longitude in degrees, decimal degrees format based on the LORAN signals. This was sent over the radio as [[MDC-1200]] or MDC-4800 data to a system controller, which plotted the mobile's approximate location on a map. The system worked reliably but sometimes had problems with electrical [[noise]] in urban areas. Sparking electric [[trolley pole]]s or industrial plants which radiated electrical noise sometime overwhelmed the LORAN signals, affecting the system's ability to determine the mobile's geolocation. Because of the limited resolution, this type of system was impractical for small communities or operational areas such as a pit mine or port.

=== Signpost systems ===

To track and locate vehicles along fixed routes, a technology called '''Signpost transmitters''' is employed. This is used on transit routes and rail lines where the vehicles to be tracked continually operated on the same linear route. A [[transponder]] or RFID chip along the vehicle route would be polled as the train or bus traverses its [[Thoroughfare|route]]. As each transponder was passed, the moving vehicle would query and receive an [[acknowledgement (data networks)|ack]], or handshake, from the signpost transmitter. A transmitter on the mobile would report passing the signpost to a system controller. This allows supervision, a [[call center]], or a [[dispatcher|dispatch]] center to monitor the progress of the vehicle and assess whether or not the vehicle was ''on schedule''. These systems are an alternative inside tunnels or other conveyances where GPS signals are blocked by terrain.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of one US signpost system, see its service manual: ''T1919A Metrocom II 150.8-174 MHz Vehicle Location Receiver'', (Schaumburg, Illinois: Motorola Communications and Electronics, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Today's GPS-based locating ===

The low price and ubiquity of [[Global Positioning System|Global Positioning System or GPS]] equipment has lent itself to more accurate and reliable telelocation systems. GPS signals are impervious to most electrical noise sources and don't require the user to install an entire system. Usually only a receiver to collect signals from the satellite segment is installed in each vehicle and radio or GSM to communicate the collected location data with a dispatch point.

Large private telelocation or AVL systems send data from GPS receivers in vehicles to a dispatch center over their private, user-owned radio backbone. These systems are used for businesses like parcel delivery and ambulances. Smaller systems which don't justify building a separate radio system use cellular or PCS data services to communicate location data from vehicles to their dispatching center. Location data is periodically polled from each vehicle in a fleet by a central controller or computer. In the simplest systems, data from the GPS receiver is displayed on a map allowing humans to determine the location of each vehicle. More complex systems feed the data into a computer assisted dispatch system which automates the process. For example, the computer assisted dispatch system may check the location of a call for service and then pick a list of the four closest ambulances. This narrows the dispatcher's choice from the entire fleet to an easier choice of four vehicles.

Some wireless carriers such as [[Sprint Nextel|Nextel]] have decided GPS was the best way to provide the mandated location data for wireless Enhanced 9-1-1. Newer [[Integrated Digital Enhanced Network|Nextel radios]] have embedded GPS receivers which are polled if 9-1-1 is dialed. The 9-1-1 center is provided with latitude and longitude from the radio's GPS receiver. In centers with [[computer-aided dispatch]], the system may assign an address to the call based on these coordinates or may project an icon depicting the caller's location onto a map of the area.

=== Sensor-augmented AVL ===

The main purpose of using AVL is not only to locate the vehicles, but also to obtain information about engine data, fuel consumption, driver data and sensor data from i.e. doors, freezer room on trucks or air pressure. Such data can be obtained via the [[CAN-bus]], via direct connections to AVL systems or via open bus systems such as [[UFDEX]] that both sends and receives data via SMS or [[GPRS]] in pure [[ASCII]] text format. Because most AVL consists of two parts, [[GPS]] and [[GSM]] modem with additional embedded AVL software contained in a [[microcontroller]], most AVL systems are fixed for its purposes unless they connect to an open bus system for expansion possibilities.

With an open bus system the users can send invoices based on goods delivered with exact location, time and date data where if connected to scale, [[RFID]] or barcode readers, can make a fairly good automated system to avoid human errors.

In countries with high prices on gasoline external fuel sensors are used to prevent cases of fuel theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfidsb.com/tm/2008/04/24/fuel-theft-in-the-usa-reaches-8-billion-in-2008/|title=fuel theft in the usa reaches 8 billion in 2008 – RFID Switchboard|author=|date=|website=www.rfidsb.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Logbook functions ===

Another scenario for sensor functions is to connect the AVL to driver information, to collect data about driving time, stops,  or even driver absence from the vehicle. If the driver/worker conditions is such as the hourly rates for driving and working outside is not the same, this can be monitored by sensors, by using [[iButton]] or other personal identification devices. Later by analyzing log-file it is possible to get reports on any kind of events, like stops, visited streets, speed limits violations, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://gurtam.com/en/docs/user-guide/new:tables&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differentiating between Automatic Vehicle Location and Events Activated Tracking Systems ==

It might be helpful to draw a distinction between vehicle location systems which track automatically and event activated tracking systems which track when triggered by an event. There is increasingly crossover between the different systems and those with experience of this sector will be able to draw on a number of examples which break the rule.

A.V.L (Automatic Vehicle Location)
This type of vehicle tracking is normally used in the fleet or driver management sector. The unit is configured to automatically transmit its location at a set time interval, e.g. every 5 minutes. The unit is activated when the ignition is switched on/off.

E.A.T.S (Events Activated Tracking system)
This type of system is primarily used in connection with vehicle or driver security solutions. If, for example a thief breaks into your car and attempts to steal it, the tracking system can be triggered by the immobiliser unit or motion sensor being activated. A monitoring bureau, will then be automatically notified that the unit has been activated and begin tracking the vehicle.

Some products on the market are a hybrid of both AVL and EATS technology.  However industry practice has tended to lean towards a separation of these functions.  It is worth taking note that vehicle tracking products tend to fall into one, not both of the technologies.

AVL technology is predominately used when applying vehicle tracking to fleet or driver management solutions.  The use of Automatic Vehicle Location is given in the following scenario; A car breaks down by the side of the road and the occupant calls a vehicle recovery company. The vehicle recovery company has several vehicles operating in the area.  Without needing to call each driver to check his location the dispatcher can pinpoint the nearest recovery vehicle and assign it to the new job.  If you were to incorporate the other aspects of vehicle telematics into this scenario; the dispatcher, rather than phoning the recovery vehicle operative, could transmit the job details directly to the operative's mobile data device, who would then use the in-vehicle satellite navigation to aid his journey to the job.

EATS technology is predominately used when applying vehicle tracking to vehicle security solutions.  An example of this distinction is given in the following scenario;  A construction company owns some pieces of plant machinery that are regularly left unattended, at weekends, on building sites. Thieves break onto one site and a piece equipment, such as a digger, is loaded on the back of a flat bed truck and then driven away.  Typically the ignition wouldn’t need to be turned on and as such most of the AVL products available wouldn’t typically be activated. Only products that included a unit that was activated by a motion sensor or GeoFence alarm event, would be activated.

Both AVL and EATS systems track, but often for different purposes.

== Special applications of automatic vehicle locating ==

Vehicle location technologies can be used in the following scenarios:

* '''[[Fleet management]]:''' when managing a fleet of vehicles, knowing the real-time location of all drivers allows management to meet customer needs more efficiently. Vehicle location information can also be used to verify that legal requirements are being met: for example, that drivers are taking rest breaks and obeying speed limits.
* '''Passenger Information:''' Real-time [[passenger information system]]s use predictions based on AVL input to show the expected arrival and departure times of [[public transport]] services.
* '''[[Asset tracking]]:''' companies needing to track valuable assets for insurance or other monitoring purposes can now plot the real-time asset location on a map and closely monitor movement and operating status. For example, haulage and logistics companies often operate trucks with detachable load carrying units. In this case, trailers can be tracked independently of the cabs used to drive them. Combining vehicle location with inventory management that can be used to reconcile which item is currently on which vehicle can be used to identify physical location down to the level of individual packages.
* '''Field worker management:''' companies with a field service or sales workforce can use information from vehicle tracking systems to plan field workers' time, schedule subsequent customer visits and be able to operate these departments efficiently.
* '''Covert surveillance:''' vehicle location devices attached covertly by law enforcement or espionage organizations can be used to track journeys made by individuals who are under surveillance

'''Carl Troll''' (24 December 1899 in [[Gabersee]] – 21 July 1975 in [[Bonn]]), was a [[Germany|German]] geographer, brother of botanist [[Wilhelm Troll]]. From 1919 until 1922 Troll studied [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[geography]] and [[physics]] at the [[University of Munich|Universität in München]]. In 1921 he obtained his doctorate in [[botany]] and in 1925 his [[habilitation]] in geography. Between 1922 and 1927 he worked as an assistant at the Geography Institute in [[Munich]]. Troll was engaged in research in the ecology and geography of mountainous lands: between 1926 and 1929 went on a research journey throughout [[South America]]n [[Andes|Andean]] countries where he visited [[Chile|northern Chile]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and [[Panama]].  In 1933  and 1934 his research interests took him to East and South Africa; in 1937 Troll was in [[Ethiopia]]; and in 1954 he visited [[Mexico]]. 

In 1930 he became professor of colonial and overseas geography in [[Berlin]], and in 1938 professor of geography in Bonn. Troll, who utilised aerial photographs in his research, coined the term [[Landscape ecology]] in 1939. He developed this terminology and many early concepts of [[landscape ecology]] and of high mountain ecology and geography as part of his early work applying [[Aerial photography|aerial photographs]] interpretation to studies of interactions between environment and vegetation and from his research travels in the mountainous regions of Asia, Africa and South America, as well as his native Europe. He developed [[seasonal climatic charts]] and [[three-dimensional climatic classification]] from hydrological, biological and economical data. 

Carl Troll was president of the [[International Geographical Union]] from 1960 to 1964

==Andean research==
Compared to other scientist of the first half of the 20th century Troll's Andean work stands out by being free of [[developmentalism|developmentalist]] thought and there is "no evidence of triumphalism of Western science in his Andean work".&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt; [[altitudinal zonation|Vertical zonation]] is the most acclaimed part of Trolls work in the Andes building upon the work of [[Alexander von Humboldt]].&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt;

===The Inca Empire and the environment===
Carl Troll argued that the development of the [[Inca Empire|Inca state]] in the central Andes was aided by conditions that allows for the elaboration of the [[staple food]] [[chuño]]. Chuño which can be stored for long times is made of potato dried at freezing temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern [[Peru]]vian highlands. Contradicting the link between the Inca state and chuño is that other crops such as maize can also be with dried only sun.&lt;ref name=Gade2016/&gt; Troll did also argue that [[llama]]s, the Inca's pack animal, can be found in its largest numbers in this very same region.&lt;ref name=Gade2016&gt;{{cite book |last=Gade |first=Daniel |date=2016 |title=Spell of the Urubamba: Anthropogeographical Essays on an Andean Valley in Space and Time |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319208480#aboutBook |chapter=Urubamba Verticality: Reflections on Crops and Diseases |location= |publisher= |page=86 |isbn=978-3-319-20849-7 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth considering the maximum extent of the Inca Empire roughly coincided with the greatest distribution of [[alpaca]]s and llamas in Pre-Hispanic America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hardoy |first=Jorge Henríque |date=1973 |title=Pre-Colombian Cities |url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=fbQJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=llama+inca+expansion+colombia+limi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rirv1B3ECv&amp;sig=eNEgkUGhfN1RQ2uoR71F2WF52Xw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFtZvGvZTZAhVJHJAKHeZYA_MQ6AEIdDAP#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page=24 |isbn=978-0802703804 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The link between the Andean [[biome]]s of [[Puna grassland|puna]] and [[páramo]], [[pastoralism]] and the Inca state is a matter of research.&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt; As a third point Troll pointed out irrigation technology as advantageous to the Inca state-building.&lt;ref name=Gade1996&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gade |first1=Daniel W. |date=1996 |title=Carl Troll on Nature and Culture in the Andes (Carl Troll über die Natur und Kultur in den Anden)  |url= |journal=[[Erdkunde]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=301–316 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Troll theorized environmental influences on the Inca Empire he opposed [[environmental determinism]] arguing that culture lied at the core of the Inca civilization.&lt;ref name=Gade1996/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8119">The '''Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing''' ('''CSTARS''') is a [[ground station]] that receives [[imagery]] data from a variety of [[remote sensing]] [[satellites]].  CSTARS is owned and operated by the [[Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science]], a college within the [[University of Miami]].

[[File:CSTARS_logo.jpg|256px|right|thumb]]

==Overview==
CSTARS is a state-of-the-art real-time satellite reception and analysis facility located in southern [[Miami-Dade county, Florida]]. Its mission is collect [[satellite imagery]] for environmental monitoring of [[hurricanes]], [[volcanoes]], [[landslides]] and other natural or man made [[disasters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.miami.edu/miami-magazine/spring03/journal.html#ujstory6 "CSTARS yields new perspectives on Earth" Miami Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013213304/http://www6.miami.edu/miami-magazine/spring03/journal.html#ujstory6 |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the University of Miami purchased the [[United States Naval Observatory]] Secondary National Time Standard Facility. The purchase included {{convert|78|acre|m2}} of land with several buildings and a 20-meter [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] once used for [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miami.edu/research/10oct2002.pdf "Research Notes" eVeritas]&lt;/ref&gt; This large antenna is currently used to support scientific communications with the [[Antarctic]] (on behalf of the [[National Science Foundation]]). Two 11 meter [[X-band]] antennas were added to create a high bandwidth data reception capability for the [[downlink]] of satellite image data. Scientists and staff perform research and analysis activities on-site as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/about-cstars About CSTARS ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708043628/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/about-cstars |date=2009-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station mask covers a very large area stretching from [[Hudson Bay]] in northeastern Canada down to northern [[South America]] in the south.  The mask includes [[Central America]], the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]], the [[Caribbean Basin]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and much of the Eastern US including [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/technical-aspects CSTARS Coverage Area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708042258/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/technical-aspects |date=2009-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  CSTARS provides a [[VoIP]] communication system for the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]].&lt;ref name=dhs/&gt;

CSTARS is located on the Richmond campus of the [[University of Miami]] at {{Coord|25.6137|-80.384|display=inline,title}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/facility CSTARS Site Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708041603/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/facility |date=2009-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hurricane Katrina Damage Assessment and Disaster Relief ==
CSTARS played a vital role in the damage assessment and relief efforts of [[New Orleans]] and the [[Gulf Coast]] in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2005/09/ Soundings Sep. 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004074650/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2005/09/ |date=October 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first remote sensing images illustrating the extent of the [[flooding]] in New Orleans were collected at CSTARS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spotimage.fr/web/en/910-new-orleans-usa.php SPOT Imagery of New Orleans, Aug. 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ==

== Admiral James G. Stavridis on CSTARS ==
Admiral [[James Stavridis]], former commanding officer of [[United States Southern Command]], writes about CSTARS in his book [https://web.archive.org/web/20120819083952/http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis.html ''Partnership for the Americas'']. In chapter 7 entitled "Innovation", he describes how CSTARS aided SOUTHCOM in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) efforts during his tenure in the SOUTHCOM AOR (i.e., in Latin America and the Caribbean):

{{quotation|Another success story can be found in an academia innovation partnership formed with the University of Miami’s Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing (CSTARS). The concept of using CSTARS was to determine how well access to a constellation of unclassified commercial satellites could support traditional Southern Command missions. Initial demonstrations were conducted with promising results. Subsequent letters of endorsements and demand signals for future use of CSTARS were published and promulgated to various centers of excellence and a funding mechanism was established within Southern Command. Within a year of the initial CSTARS demonstrations, hurricanes ravaged Haiti in 2008 and Southern Command responded with assistance, including an impromptu emergency redeployment of USS Kearsarge from its previously scheduled mission. Assessment of inland damage caused by the hurricanes was a critical need to the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) efforts, and CSTARS provided vital imagery to those operations to quickly determine areas of highest damage and evaluation of inland infrastructure. Unclassified CSTARS imagery and information were then rapidly broadcast and distributed to both DOD and interagency responders via unclassified email. This response was only possible due to the groundwork laid during the initial CSTARS demonstration and a long-term vision for follow-on support made possible by CSTARS to Southern Command.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis-ch7.html ''Partnership for the Americas''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917043652/http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis-ch7.html |date=September 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
The Centre for Cities was launched in March 2005 as part of [[Institute for Public Policy Research|IPPR]] and became independent in November 2007.

==Research==
The Centre produces an annual Cities Outlook report assessing the economic performance of the 64 largest towns and cities in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.centreforcities.org/research/outlook14.html | title=Cities Outlook 2014 | publisher=Centre for Cities | date=27 January 2014 | accessdate=20 August 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820220140/http://www.centreforcities.org/research/outlook14.html | archivedate=20 August 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-25879681 | title=Centre for Cities says economic gap with London widening | publisher=BBC News | date=27 January 2014 | accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/24/cities-report-economic-recovery | title=Cities report reveals mixed picture of economic recovery | publisher=The Guardian | date=24 January 2011 | accessdate=20 August 2014 | author=Helen Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2016 onwards the Centre for Cities reevaluated its methodology for defining [[Primary Urban Area|Primary Urban Areas]], based on this it now recognises 63 Primary urban areas in the UK, with [[Grimsby]] and [[Hastings]] dropped and [[Basildon]], [[Exeter]] and [[Slough]] included and [[Bolton]] and [[Rochdale]] merged with the [[Manchester]] PUA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The changing geography of the UK economy - Centre for Cities|url=http://www.centreforcities.org/publication/the-changing-geography-of-the-uk-economy/|publisher=Centre for Cities|accessdate=11 August 2017|date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the Centre for Cities released a report challenging the Government's approach to improving UK business productivity. They suggest that the Government should focus on the UK's weaker regions to attract more productive exporters, and not just focus on the UK's least productive companies in general&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Delphine Strauss|title=‘Solution’ to UK productivity puzzle is misconceived, study finds|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d8f5322a-5e19-11e8-ad91-e01af256df68|website=The Financial Times|accessdate=27 May 2018|date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Edgar Thomas Towner''', [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Military Cross|MC]] (19 April 1890 – 18 August 1972) was an [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|Australian recipient]] of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry "in the face of the enemy" that can be awarded to members of the British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. A [[lieutenant]] in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] during the [[First World War]], Towner was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 1 September 1918, during an attack on [[Mont St. Quentin]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

Born in Queensland to a farming family, Towner enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in 1915. Posted to the transport section of the 25th Battalion, he served in Egypt until his unit was sent to the Western Front. He then transferred to the [[2nd Machine Gun Battalion (Australia)|2nd Machine Gun Battalion]] where he was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a lieutenant and twice [[mentioned in despatches]] for his leadership. During June 1918, Towner led a machine gun section in attack near [[Morlancourt]] and assisted the infantry in reaching its objectives under heavy fire, for which he was awarded the [[Military Cross]]. In September, again commanding a machine gun section, he was involved in the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] counteroffensive that broke the German lines at Mont St. Quentin and [[Péronne, Somme|Péronne]]. Fighting for thirty hours after being wounded, his "conspicuous bravery, initiative and devotion to duty" earned him the Victoria Cross, which was presented by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] in April 1919.

Discharged in August, Towner returned to Australia. He was appointed a director of the Russleigh Pastoral Company, and briefly re-enlisted during the [[Second World War]], when he was promoted to [[major]]. A keen geographer, he was awarded the Dr Thomson Foundation Gold Medal in 1956 for his geographical work. Unmarried, he died in 1972 at the age of 82.

==Early life==
Edgar Towner was born on 19 April 1890, at Glencoe Station near [[Blackall, Queensland]], to Edgar Thomas Towner, a grazing farmer, and his Irish wife Greta (née Herley). He was educated at Blackall State School and in [[Rockhampton, Queensland|Rockhampton]], although he also received private instruction from his mother.&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Gorrell|first=Richard|year=1990|id=A120275b|title=Towner, Edgar Thomas (1890–1972)|accessdate=21 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VCs110"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gliddon|2000|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving school Towner worked on his father's grazing property until 1912, when he acquired land of his own. He named the property "Valparaiso" and worked on its development until the outbreak of the First World War.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

==First World War==
On 4 January 1915, Towner enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force.&lt;ref name="AF"&gt;{{Harvnb|Staunton|2005|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assigned to the transport section of the [[25th/49th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment|25th Battalion]] as a [[Private (rank)|private]],&lt;ref name="ServRec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/imagine.asp?B=1935398&amp;I=1&amp;SE=1|title=Towner, Edgar Thomas 1067 |accessdate=23 January 2009|work=Records Search|publisher=National Archives of Australia}}
&lt;/ref&gt; he embarked aboard HMAT ''Aeneas'' from [[Brisbane]] on 29 June, bound for Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm8/23_42_1/pdf/0003.pdf|title=Edgar Thomas Towner|accessdate=23 January 2009|format=PDF|work=First World War Embarkation Roll|publisher=Australian War Memorial|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306014517/https://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm8/23_42_1/pdf/0003.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The troopship arrived in August, and the battalion spent the rest of the month training in the desert before transferring to the [[Gallipoli Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="25th"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11212.asp|title=25th Battalion |accessdate=23 January 2009|work=Australian military units|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Towner, however, remained in Egypt with the army's transportation elements.&lt;ref name="ServRec"/&gt;

Following the [[Allies (World War I)|Allied]] evacuation of Gallipoli, the 25th Battalion returned to Egypt in December 1915,&lt;ref name="25th"/&gt; where Towner rejoined its ranks on 10 January 1916. He was promoted to [[sergeant]] on 1 February, before departing with the battalion at [[Alexandria]] the following month to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] on the Western Front. Disembarking at [[Marseilles]],&lt;ref name="AIF"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aif.adfa.edu.au/showPerson?pid=303267|title=Edgar Thomas Towner |accessdate=23 January 2009|work=AIF Project|publisher=Australian Defence Force Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; the unit was the first Australian battalion to arrive in France.&lt;ref name="25th"/&gt;

[[File:E T Towner P02939.035.JPG|thumb|left|upright|175px|alt=Close up informal portrait of man in military uniform|Lieutenant E. T. Towner c. 1918]]

In July 1916, the 25th Battalion took part in its first major Western Front action at the [[Battle of Pozières]], part of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme offensive]]. The battalion suffered 785 casualties between 25 July and 7 August. It was briefly transferred to a "quieter sector of the front in Belgium" before returning to action on the Somme in October.&lt;ref name="25th"/&gt; On 3 November, Towner was transferred to the [[Australian Machine Gun Corps]] and was assigned to the [[2nd Machine Gun Battalion (Australia)|2nd Machine Gun Battalion]] of the [[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Australian Division]], and was allotted to the [[7th Brigade (Australia)|7th Brigade]]'s Machine Gun Company.&lt;ref name="ServRec"/&gt; He was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] fifteen days later,&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AIF"/&gt; and assumed command of the battalion's transport section.&lt;ref name="ServRec"/&gt;

Promoted to [[First Lieutenant|lieutenant]] on 24 February 1917,&lt;ref name="AF2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Staunton|2005|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towner's service with his transport section earned him praise for his "devotion to duty and consistent good work",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/83/0130.pdf|title=Recommendation for Edgar Thomas Towner to be awarded a Mention in Despatches|accessdate=28 January 2009|format=PDF|work=Recommendations: First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305201804/https://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/83/0130.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 9 April he was [[Mentioned in Despatches|Mentioned in the Despatches]] of [[Field Marshal]] [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30107|date=1 June 1917|page=5423 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towner was granted leave to the United Kingdom in January 1918.&lt;ref name="AIF"/&gt; He received a second Mention in Despatches on 7 April 1918, the notification of which was published in a supplement to the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 28 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30706|date=28 May 1918|page=6203 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 10/11 June 1918, Towner was in command of a machine gun section during an attack to the south of [[Morlancourt]]. One of the first to reach the objective, he deployed his section and got its guns into action "very quickly".&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/111/0069.pdf|title=Recommendation for Edgar Thomas Towner to be awarded a Military Cross|accessdate=28 January 2009|format=PDF|work=Recommendations: First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305202408/https://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/111/0069.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using captured German machine guns he was able to increase his section's fire&lt;ref name="AF2"/&gt; and provide support to the company on his right as it advanced, seized, and consolidated its position.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; During the morning of 11 June, one of the posts held by the Australian infantry was blown in by German artillery; braving machine gun and sniper fire, Towner went out in daylight to help reorganise the post. Cited for his "cheerful and untiring attitude" and for "set[ing] a conspicuous example",&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; Towner was awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his actions. The announcement of the award and accompanying citation was published in a supplement to the ''London Gazette'' on 24 September 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30915|date=24 September 1918|page=11320 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria Cross===
On 1 September 1918, Towner was in command of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Section of the 7th Machine Gun Company during an attack on [[Battle of Mont St. Quentin|Mont St. Quentin]], near [[Péronne, Somme|Péronne]].&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt; Armed with four [[Vickers machine gun]]s,&lt;ref name="VCrec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/118P2/0056.pdf|title=Recommendation for Edgar Thomas Towner to be awarded a Victoria Cross|accessdate=30 January 2009|format=PDF|work=Recommendations: First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5invpGMRI?url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/118P2/0056.pdf|archivedate=5 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the section was attached to the right flank of the 24th Australian Infantry Battalion, whose principal objective was to seize the summit of Mont St. Quentin. To accomplish this, the battalion would have to advance through the village of Feuillaucourt before moving down to the Péronne road.&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCs109"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gliddon|2000|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australians began their advance at 06:00 behind an artillery screen, with Towner's section covering a front of {{convert|1400|m|yd}}.&lt;ref name="VCrec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCs109"/&gt; Visibility was limited by rain, and Australian casualties soon began to mount.&lt;ref name="VCs109"/&gt; Locating a German machine gun that was causing heavy losses among the advancing troops, Towner rushed the position and single-handedly killed the crew with his revolver. Having captured the gun, he then turned it on the Germans.&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCrec"/&gt;

[[File:Edgar Towner full length J03070.JPG|thumb|upright|right|175px|alt=Full-length portrait of man in military uniform wearing medals|Full-length portrait of Lieutenant Edgar Towner c. 1918]]

Once Feuillaucourt had fallen, the 24th Battalion continued to the Péronne road.&lt;ref name="VCs109"/&gt; However, the Germans had occupied a [[copse]] of trees and put up strong resistance, halting the advance.&lt;ref name="VCrec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCs109"/&gt; German troops were observed massing for a counter-attack, so Towner moved forward with several of his men, two Vickers guns, and the captured German gun, and brought the assembling Germans under concentrated fire, inflicting many casualties.&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt; Attempting to retire, a party of twenty-five German soldiers were cut off by Towner's guns and taken [[prisoners of war|prisoner]].&lt;ref name="VCrec"/&gt; Under heavy incoming fire, Towner then scouted over open terrain to locate advantageous positions from which his guns could offer further support.&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCrec"/&gt; When he moved his section forward, the machine gunners were able to engage more groups of German soldiers; their aggressive action enabled the advance to be renewed, and the battalion attained the cover of a sunken section of the Péronne road.&lt;ref name="VCrec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCs109"/&gt; However, on rejoining them Towner found that his section was growing short of ammunition, so he made his way back across the fire-swept ground and located a German machine gun, which he brought forward along with several boxes of ammunition. This he brought into action "in full view of the enemy";&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCrec"/&gt; his effective fire forced the Germans to retire further, and allowed one of the stalled Australian flanks to push ahead.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCrec"/&gt;

German machine gunners had occupied a commanding vantage overlooking the sunken road, and began to rain down heavy fire around Towner's position. One of the bullets struck his helmet, inflicting a gaping wound to his scalp. Refusing to be evacuated for medical treatment, Towner continued firing his gun as the German pressure increased and the situation grew critical.&lt;ref name="VCs110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCrec2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/118P2/0057.pdf|title=Recommendation for Edgar Thomas Towner to be awarded a Victoria Cross (Cont)|accessdate=18 February 2009|format=PDF|work=Recommendations: First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5invpGcIT?url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/118P2/0057.pdf|archivedate=5 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the Australian infantry were forced to retire a short distance, but with all its crew having become casualties, one gun was left behind. Alone, Towner dashed out over [[no man's land]] and retrieved the weapon. With this gun he "continued to engage the enemy whenever they appeared", putting a German machine gun out of action with his accurate fire.&lt;ref name="VCrec2"/&gt;

Throughout the night, Towner frequented the front lines and "continued to fight and&amp;nbsp;... inspire his men".&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCrec2"/&gt; He provided supporting fire for the 21st Australian Infantry Battalion as they assaulted a heavily fortified crater on Mont St. Quentin's summit, and repeatedly reconnoitred the German position to reported on troop movements.&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCrec2"/&gt; The next morning his section assisted in repulsing a large German counterattack before Towner was finally evacuated with exhaustion—thirty hours after being wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/118P2/0058.pdf|title=Recommendation for Edgar Thomas Towner to be awarded a Victoria Cross (Cont #2)|accessdate=18 February 2009|format=PDF|work=Recommendations: First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5invpH3bA?url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/118P2/0058.pdf|archivedate=5 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially admitted to the 41st Casualty Clearing Station, he was transported by train to the 2nd [[Red Cross]] Hospital at [[Rouen]].&lt;ref name="AIF"/&gt; For his actions during the battle, Towner was awarded the Victoria Cross—the third of six Australians to receive the medal during the fighting around Mont St. Quentin and Péronne.&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCs109"/&gt;

The full citation for Towner's Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the ''London Gazette'' on 14 December 1918, reading:&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31067|date=14 December 1918|page=14775 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned Officers, Warrant Officer, Non-commissioned Officers and Men: —

Lt. Edgar Thomas Towner, M.C., 2nd Bn., Aus. M.G. Corps.

For most conspicuous bravery, initiative and devotion to duty on 1st September, 1918, in the attack on Mont St. Quentin, near Peronne, when in charge of four Vickers guns. During the early stages of the advance he located and captured, single-handed, an enemy machine-gun which was causing casualties, and by turning it on the enemy inflicted severe losses.

Subsequently, by the skilful, tactical handling of his guns, he cut off and captured twenty-five of the enemy.

Later, by fearless reconnaissance under heavy fire, and by the energy, foresight and promptitude with which he brought fire to bear on various enemy groups, he gave valuable support to the infantry advance.

Again, when short of ammunition, he secured an enemy machine-gun, which he mounted and fired in full view of the enemy, causing the enemy to retire further, and enabling our infantry to advance. Under intense fire, although wounded, he maintained the fire of this gun at a very critical period.

During the following night he steadied and gave valuable support to a small detached post, and by his coolness and cheerfulness inspirited the men in a great degree.

Throughout the night he kept close watch by personal reconnaissance on the enemy movements, and was evacuated exhausted thirty hours after being wounded.

The valour and resourcefulness of Lt. Towner undoubtedly saved a very critical situation, and contributed largely to the success of the attack.}}

===Later war service===
Following his recuperation, Towner was granted three weeks leave to England from 14 September 1918. He rejoined his unit on 12 October and, for six days, was attached to the School of Instruction. Following thirteen days leave in France during late November, he returned again to the 2nd Machine Gun Battalion on 12 December.&lt;ref name="AIF"/&gt;

On 10 April 1919, Towner attended an investiture ceremony in the ballroom of [[Buckingham Palace]], during which he was decorated with his Victoria Cross and Military Cross by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].&lt;ref name="VCs110"/&gt; Three weeks later he boarded HT ''Karagola'', bound for Australia. Disembarking at [[Sydney]] on 14 June 1919 he made his way to Brisbane, and was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 16 August 1919.&lt;ref name="AIF"/&gt;

==Later life==
Towner resettled on his property, but was forced to sell Valparaiso in 1922 after he was unable to raise sufficient funds to purchase livestock. He spent the next three years working as a [[Jackaroo (trainee)|jackaroo]], until he entered into a partnership on Kaloola station, a property located near [[Longreach, Queensland|Longreach]], in 1925.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCs111"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gliddon|2000|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towner eventually bought out his partner and assumed another partnership with the Russleigh Pastoral Company, [[Isisford, Queensland|Isisford]]. He was later appointed a director of the company.&lt;ref name="AF2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCs111"/&gt;

With the [[Second World War]] looming, Towner enlisted in the [[Citizens Military Force]] on 8 August 1939 and was appointed a [[Captain (land)|captain]] to the [[26th Battalion (Australia)|26th Battalion]].&lt;ref name="AF2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=A&amp;veteranId=495954|title=Towner, Edgar Thomas |accessdate=18 February 2009|work=World War II Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a period as a company commander he was promoted to temporary [[major]] and second-in-command of the battalion, under fellow Victoria Cross recipient Lieutenant Colonel [[Harry Murray]]. However, Towner retired from the army due to ill health on 21 February 1942, and returned to his property at Kaloola.&lt;ref name="AF2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCs111"/&gt;

A keen [[geographer]], Towner would often disappear into the [[The Bush#Australia|bush]] for weeks on end, for study or exploration.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCs111"/&gt; As a fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] of Australia and member of the Royal Historical Society of New South Wales,&lt;ref name="AF2"/&gt; he took a particular interest in researching the life of the explorer [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Sir Thomas Mitchell]]. In 1946, he successfully lobbied the [[Australian Government]] to issue a [[postage stamp]] commemorating the centenary of Mitchell's discoveries in central Queensland.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCs111"/&gt; He addressed the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia in Brisbane in 1955, and was awarded the Dr Thomson Foundation Gold Medal for his geographical work the following year. Towner's address was published in 1957, in a booklet entitled ''Lake Eyre and its Tributaries''.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AF2"/&gt;

Towner never married, and on 18 August 1972 died at Longreach Base Hospital at the age of 82. His funeral took place three days later, with a large number of Longreach citizens lining the streets to see his coffin pass by atop a gun carriage. Following a service at St Andrew's Church, he was buried with full military honours at the Longreach Town Cemetery. By the time of his death, Towner had amassed an {{convert|80000|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm containing 25,000 sheep.&lt;ref name="VCs111"/&gt; He remains the highest-decorated serviceman from Queensland.&lt;ref name="The Age"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Courier"/&gt; On 24 April 2009, a statue of Towner crafted by [[Melbourne]] sculptor William Eicholtz was unveiled in his birth town of Blackall. Inspired by an essay written by a local schoolboy, the community raised [[Australian dollar|A$]]80,000 to commission a monument in Towner's memory.&lt;ref name="The Age"&gt;{{cite news|first=Clare|last=Kermond|title=Country boy's essay inspires tribute to hero|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/country-boys-essay-inspires-tribute-to-hero-20090105-7aj0.html|work=theage.com.au|publisher=The Age|date=6 January 2009|accessdate=21 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Courier"&gt;{{cite news|first=Rodney|last=Chester|title=Schoolboy flies flag for war hero Edgar Towner|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,25382033-3102,00.html|work=couriermail.com.au|publisher=The Courier Mail|date=25 April 2009|accessdate=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EgyptSat 1''' or '''MisrSat-1''' is [[Egypt]]'s first [[Earth]] [[remote sensing]] [[satellite]]. This satellite was jointly built by Egypt's [[National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences]] together with the [[Yuzhnoye Design Bureau]] in [[Ukraine]] and was launched on board a [[Dnepr (rocket)|Dnepr rocket]] on 17 April 2007 from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]].

The effort was spearheaded by Dr. Aly Sadek, chairman of the Egyptian Council for Space Science and Technology Research. It in many ways was considered a huge step for the Egyptians since it marked the first time they opted for technology transfer during the manufacturing the satellite rather than simply purchasing one (as in case of the [[Nilesat]] satellites). On 23 October 2010, the National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences announced that control and communication with the satellite had been lost since July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%8A-%C2%AB%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%AA-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AA-1%C2%BB&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.masrawy.com/News/Egypt/Politics/2010/october/25/satalight.aspx?ref=rss |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028025322/http://www.masrawy.com/News/Egypt/Politics/2010/october/25/satalight.aspx?ref=rss |archivedate=2010-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.masrawy.com/News/Egypt/Politics/2010/october/23/sat.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026032020/http://www.masrawy.com/News/Egypt/Politics/2010/october/23/sat.aspx |archivedate=2010-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2001, Egypt posted an international tender for the development of the first Egyptian satellite for the observation and remote sensing and bidders from Ukraine,UK, Russia, Korea and Italy competed for the deal.&lt;ref name=russianspace /&gt;&lt;ref name=russianspaceweb-2&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian application satellites - Ukraine to build satellite for Egypt |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/spacecraft_application.html |website=russianspaceweb.com |accessdate=1 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007231556/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/spacecraft_application.html |archivedate=7 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

on June 26, 2001 KB Yuzhnoe design bureau from Ukraine announced winner and on October 24, a contract had been signed in Egypt.&lt;ref name=Moscow&gt;{{cite web|title=Ukraine’s Space Program|url=http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/4-2001/mas/usp/?form=print|website=Moscow Defense Brief|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consortium consisted of KB Yuzhnoe design bureau and sub-contrators Ukrainian companies:&lt;ref name=russianspace /&gt;&lt;ref name=direct /&gt;&lt;ref name=Moscow /&gt;
* ''Yuzhnoye'' - prime contractor responsible for the platform and the launch
* ''Yuzhmash'' - Scientific Research Institute of Radio Engineering Measurements
* ''Khartron-Konsat'' and ''Khartron-Yukom'' - Research and Scientific Production Enterprises
* ''KONEX'' - State Research and Production Enterprise
* ''CONECS'' - responsible for the development of the two optical payloads, the onboard payload command and data handling subsystem, as well as for the development of the data processing in the [[ground segment]]
* ''Arsenal'' - optics manufacturing

===The Egyptian Space Program===
The Egyptian space program in fact started in the nineteen fifties but it wasn't until the 
establishment of the Egyptian Space Council in 16/5/1998 and the approval of a year later in 26/5/1999 of the Egyptian Space Program within the National Authority of Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

====Objectives====
*Enabling Egypt to join the Space Technology Age through designing and manufacturing of small research and remote sensing satellites, acquiring technological knowledge and capabilities, and building required infrastructure to achieve self-capability to design &amp; manufactures small satellites

{{advert|date=February 2013}}
Produced by the [[Environmental Systems Research Institute]] ([[Esri]], formerly ESRI), the '''Esri International User Conference''' (Esri UC) is the world's largest event dedicated to [[geographic information system]] (GIS) technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geoconnexion.com/uploads/Esri_user_conference_intv7i9.pdf Pellegrini, Maria. ''GEOconnexion International Magazine''. ESRI User Conference 2008 Report. Pp. 52-54.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is held annually in the United States, usually for one week in July at the [[San Diego Convention Center]] in [[San Diego]], California.  The Esri UC dates back to 1981. In 2008, conference attendance grew to more than 14,000 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/fall08articles/the-2008-Esri-uc.html Lawson, Aly. ''ArcNews Online''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ESRIUC2008.jpg|thumb|400x200px|alt=Esri UC.|Esri UC 2008]]

The conference offers more than 600 [[GIS]] user presentation sessions, 300 exhibitors, 275 technical workshops, 100 special interest, regional, and user group meetings, and 600 map posters and special displays from more than 100 countries. Thousands of professionals from different industries attend the Esri UC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esri.com/news/arcwatch/0410/Esri-uc.html Lawson, Aly. ''ArcWatch: Your e-Magazine for GIS News, Views, and Insights''.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are more than 40 conference tracks divided into the categories of technology, science and modeling, and industry.  The tracks include the topics of business, defense, education, environment, government, health and human services, natural resources, public safety, transportation, and utilities. 

There are also preconference seminars, a Plenary Session, a Map Gallery and Virtual Map Gallery, GIS concept and industry sessions, panel sessions, lightning talks, an Esri Showcase, a Conservation Showcase, an Academic GIS Program Fair, a Special Achievement in GIS (SAG) Awards Ceremony, and special displays of GIS by organizations such as the National Geographic Society, the National Academy of Science, and the Smithsonian. The Exhibit Hall runs for three days during the event – Tuesday through Thursday – and provides access to Esri business partners and alliances, hardware and software vendors, and solution and data providers.  There are additional activities to participate in including a 5K, Golf Tournament, and Tennis Tournament.  

In 2009, four conferences took place concurrently with the Esri UC (the Esri Business GIS Summit, [[Esri Education User Conference]], Esri Homeland Security GIS Summit, and Esri Survey &amp; Engineering GIS Summit.) The Esri Defense and Intelligence Executive Track, Esri Senior Executive Seminar, Remote Sensing and GIS gathering, and Climate Change GIS Special Program also took place during the event. 

A certain amount of complimentary conference registrations are often available with an organization's [[ArcGIS]] software maintenance plan.

== History ==

The first Esri UC took place in 1981 in Redlands, California, at Esri Headquarters, with 15 users, and has been held annually ever since including being held in Palm Springs, California, from 1987 through 1996. The conference was the brainchild of Esri President and Founder Jack Dangermond.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esri.com/about-Esri/about/history.html ''Esri Company History''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

An orientation session is offered for new attendees at the start of the conference to help them prepare for the week and plan their schedule.  The Esri UC comprehensively covers GIS from the perspective of Esri's software and approach; the technical workshops focus on Esri products, and occasionally on software by other vendors as it relates to Esri's products.  GIS software by other vendors – Autodesk, MapInfo, Google, and others – is not the focus of the conference, although translation and interoperability issues may be addressed during technical workshops.

A number of awards are presented during the Plenary Session and throughout the conference week to honor organizations and individuals doing innovative and meaningful things with GIS. Recent plenary award presentations have included the Enterprise Application Award, Making a Difference Award, GIS Humanitarian Award, The President's Award, and Lifetime Achievement Award. Other conference aspects that highlight awards include the Special Achievement in GIS (SAG) Awards ceremony, Map Gallery and Virtual Map Gallery, User Software Applications Fair, sports activities, and other various contests such as scavenger hunts, satellite image picture puzzles (the Where in the World contest), and the closing session question poll.  

The conference's Student Assistantship Program was started in the early 1990s. Each year, up to 60 accepted students from around the world spend the week monitoring sessions and assisting with other event logistics. The assistantship is unpaid but provides conference registration, hotel accommodations, a stipend for meals, and free time to attend sessions and network. 

For two hours Wednesday night of conference week, the Exhibit Pavilion is opened to family and friends of attendees for Family Night. This is the only time that guests of attendees can visit the Exhibit Pavilion, where technology vendors and demonstrations are available—and attendees can show their guests what GIS involves.   

The GIS Kids Camp provides children of all ages with a way to explore GIS. Children learn how GIS helps them ask questions and visualize the answers. The camp was launched at the 1997 Esri UC in San Diego. Over the years, the program has introduced GIS to more than 1,500 children. 

A conference highlight is the Thursday Night Party, which has a different theme each year that ranges from Mardi Gras to a Renaissance Faire, to Oktoberfest. 

The Spatial Outlet and Bookstore offers T-shirts, mouse pads, and other event memorabilia. There are also GIS books for sale as well as author signings.  This is the spot to acquire souvenirs and books from Esri Press, as well as other specialty merchandise. 

Over the last several years Esri, its business partners, and the San Diego venues have increased the ecofriendliness of the event. Examples of this include using reusable materials and recycled paper for promotional items such as tote bags and agendas; making previously printed items only available on the Web; selling organic T-shirts in the Spatial Outlet store; offering recycling bins, water in bottles which use less plastic, biodegradable food service items, and food purchased from local growers when possible; as well as encouraging and promoting resources for carpooling and renting a bike as transportation for the week.  

Esri turned 40 in 2009. [[Jack Dangermond]] (current president) and Laura Dangermond (current vice president) founded Esri in 1969 as a landscape architectural consulting firm. Esri products are used by nearly 80 percent of all GIS users. The company remains a private corporation with consistent annual growth and annual revenue of more than $610 million. There are more than 4,000 employees. The Esri headquarters are located in [[Redlands, California]]. There are 10 regional offices in the U.S. and a network of 80 international distributors with about a million users in 200 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esri|title=Esri Offices Worldwide|url=http://www.esri.com/about-esri/contact#outsideUS|website=Esri.com|publisher=Esri|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Florida Parishes''' ({{lang-es|Parroquias de Florida}}, {{lang-fr|Paroisses de Floride}}), on the east side of [[Mississippi River]] &amp;mdash; an area also known as the '''Northshore''' or '''Northlake''' region &amp;mdash; are eight [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parishes]] in southeast [[Louisiana]], [[United States]], which were part of [[West Florida]] in the 18th and early 19th centuries.

Unlike most of the state, this region was not part of the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]]; it had been under [[United Kingdom|British]] and then Spanish control since 1763.

==Geography &amp; demographics==
The Florida Parishes of Louisiana stretch from the [[Mississippi]] state line on its eastern and northern borders, to the Mississippi River on its western border, and [[Lake Pontchartrain]] on its southern border. The most populated community is the [[Baton Rouge metropolitan area]]. ([[St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana|St. Tammany Parish]] is part of the [[New Orleans metropolitan area]].)

The Parishes have a land area of 4,685.184 square miles (12,134.57&amp;nbsp;km²), or 10.755 percent of the state's land area. Its population at the 2000 census was 887,444 residents, or 19.858 percent of the state's population at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=dt&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&amp;-CHECK_SEARCH_RESULTS=N&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_P001&amp;-tree_id=4001&amp;-redoLog=true&amp;-all_geo_types=N&amp;-transpose=N&amp;-_caller=geoselect&amp;-geo_id=04000US22&amp;-geo_id=05000US22033&amp;-geo_id=05000US22037&amp;-geo_id=05000US22063&amp;-geo_id=05000US22091&amp;-geo_id=05000US22103&amp;-geo_id=05000US22105&amp;-geo_id=05000US22117&amp;-geo_id=05000US22125&amp;-search_results=16000US2267215&amp;-fully_or_partially=N&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-show_geoid=Y]&lt;/ref&gt; Its largest communities are, in descending order of population (2000 census), [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]], [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]], [[Shenandoah, Louisiana|Shenandoah]] ([[Census-designated place|CDP]]), [[Baker, Louisiana|Baker]], [[Bogalusa, Louisiana|Bogalusa]], [[Zachary, Louisiana|Zachary]], [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]], [[Merrydale, Louisiana|Merrydale]] (CDP), [[Gardere, Louisiana|Gardere]] (CDP), [[Denham Springs, Louisiana|Denham Springs]], [[Covington, Louisiana|Covington]], [[Oak Hills Place, Louisiana|Oak Hills Place]] (CDP), and [[Lacombe, Louisiana|Lacombe]] (CDP).

==History==
[[Image:Bonnie Blue flag of the Confederate States of America.svg|thumb|200px|The "[[Bonnie Blue Flag]]" of [[West Florida]]]]

The area that became the Florida Parishes was at one time part of [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]]. Following the [[French and Indian War]], however, the region, like most of the rest of French Louisiana east of the [[Mississippi River]] (excepting [[Île d'Orléans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]), was transferred to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. The region became part of the British colonial province of [[West Florida]].

Following the [[American Revolutionary War]], West Florida was the subject of a border dispute between the newly-formed [[United States]] and [[Spain]], which acquired West and [[East Florida]] from the British after the war. The dispute led American and British settlers in the part of West Florida west of the [[Perdido River]] to declare an independent [[Republic of West Florida]] in 1810 and elected their leader, [[Fulwar Skipwith]], as president. (None of the short-lived Republic of West Florida lay within the boundaries of the modern state of Florida.) The flag of the Republic of West Florida, which is often identified with the [[Bonnie Blue Flag]] of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, flies on many public buildings in the Florida Parishes. In 2006 the state legislature designated it the "official flag of the '''Republic of West Florida Historic Region'''."&lt;ref name="LA25705"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2006/9/84534.html|title=2006 Louisiana Laws - RS 25:705 — Bonnie blue flag adopted|work=Justia US Law|accessdate=2 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic was quickly annexed by the United States, and the present-day Florida Parishes were incorporated into the [[Territory of Orleans]], which joined the Union as the State of [[Louisiana]] in 1812. In 1810, four parishes were established in the region: East Baton Rouge, Feliciana, St. Helena, and St. Tammany. Later in the 19th century, five additional parishes were created as follows, with [[Feliciana Parish, Louisiana|Feliciana Parish]] ceasing to exist:

* Washington Parish, 1819; from part of St. Tammany Parish
 
* East Feliciana &amp; West Feliciana Parishes, 1824; by dividing Feliciana Parish

* Livingston Parish, 1832; from part of St. Helena Parish

* Tangipahoa Parish, 1869; from parts of Livingston, St. Helena, St. Tammany, and Washington parishes

In 1990, the state of Louisiana formally designated this part of the state as "the Republic of West Florida Historic Region, or the Florida Parishes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2011/rs/title25/rs25-701/|work=Justia US Law|title=LA Rev Stat § 25:701 Republic of West Florida Historic Region|accessdate=2 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1993, [[Interstate 12]], which runs east and west through the [[Lake Pontchartrain#Northshore|Northshore region]], has been officially designated as the '''Republic of West Florida Parkway'''.

==Biography==

===Early Life and Civil War===
Born on March 21, 1839 in of [[Mendon, Massachusetts]], his father had helped combat the [[Dorr Rebellion]] in neighboring [[Rhode Island]], and his great-grandmother was [[Deborah Sampson]]. At age ten his parents moved to the Utopian community of [[Hopedale, Massachusetts]] In Hopedale he trained to become a [[printer (publishing)|printer]], and his first job was as a printer's assistant in a [[newspaper]] influenced by [[Adin Ballou]]. In 1861 he left to [[Boston]], where he enlisted into the [[Union Army]] to fight in the [[American Civil War]]. The enlistment [[clerk]] wrote his profession as [[painter]] rather than printer when he signed up. This caused him to be changed from being an infantryman to becoming a [[combat engineer]].

===Wheeler Survey===
After the war, Thompson went to [[Washington DC]], where he became associated with the [[US Geological Survey]]. In 1872 he joined the Wheeler Survey, under Lieutenant [[George Wheeler (explorer)|George Wheeler]]. He would stay on the Wheeler survey for the next seven years, making friends with the likes of [[Henry Wetherbee Henshaw]], [[Rogers Birnie]], and [[William Henry Rideing]]. In 1875, he led an expedition to [[Spirit Mountain (Nevada)|Spirit Mountain]] in [[Nevada]], of which he did the first topographical sketch. In 1879 he went into the [[Great Basin]] with [[Grove Karl Gilbert]] and [[John Welsey Powell]].

====Fingerprints====
Thompson claimed to have been the first person to use fingerprints for identification in 1882, when he had his thumb print on a message that said "August 8, 1882-Mr. Jonas Sutler will pay Lying Bob Seventy Five Dollar". {{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=May 2016}}

===After the Wheeler Survey===
In 1884 Thompson was made head of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] division of the US Geological Survey. In 1888 he co-founded the [[National Geographic Society]], and in 1889 provided the first map supplement for the [[National Geographic Magazine]]; "North Carolina-Tennessee-Asheville Sheet".

He was also involved in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], [[Sons of the American Revolution]], [[General Society of the War of 1812]] and the [[Society of Colonial Wars]]. He also studied [[genealogy]], finding connections between himself and [[Sir Humphrey Gilbert]] as well as [[Myles Standish]], and was an [[antiquarian]].

===Death===
Major Gilbert Thompson died on June 8, 1909.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1330">The idea of [[human geography]] originated rather early in [[China]], about 2,000 years ago. The classical works of [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]] and [[Chinese history|history]] contained much of the concept of the relationship between human activities and "Tian" (the heaven) or "Di" (the earth), recognizing that both sides were now and then in harmonious state or in contradictory condition, and both sides had their own evolutionary law.

The '''Julian March''' ([[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]]: ''Julijska krajina'') or '''Julian Venetia''' ({{lang-it|Venezia Giulia}}; {{lang-vec|Venesia Julia}}; {{lang-fur|Vignesie Julie}}; {{lang-de|Julisch Venetien}}) is an area of [[southeastern Europe]] which is divided among [[Croatia]], [[Italy]] and [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gTA34DxHx4AC&amp;pg=PA307 The New Europe by Bernard Newman, pp. 307, 309]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4h1nAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Graziadio+Isaia+Ascoli+venezia+giulia&amp;dq=Graziadio+Isaia+Ascoli+venezia+giulia&amp;lr=&amp;pgis=1 ''Contemporary History on Trial: Europe Since 1989 and the Role of the Expert Historian'' by Harriet Jones, Kjell Ostberg, Nico Randeraad] {{ISBN|0-7190-7417-7}} p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined in 1863 by Italian [[Historical linguistics|linguist]] [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]] to demonstrate that the [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Veneto]], [[Friuli]] and [[Trentino]] (parts of the [[Austrian Empire]]) had a common Italian linguistic identity. Ascoli emphasized the [[Augustus|Augustan]] partition of [[Roman Italy]] at the beginning of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], when ''Venetia et Histria'' was ''Regio X'' (the Tenth Region).&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gTA34DxHx4AC&amp;pg=PA307 Bernard Newman, ''The New Europe''], pp. 307, 309&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Cattaruzza"&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=0OhRDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Marina Cattaruzza, ''Italy and Its Eastern Border, 1866–2016'', Routledge 2016 - ch. I]  {{ISBN|978-1138791749}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The term was later endorsed by [[Italian irredentism|Italian irredentists]], who sought to annex regions in which ethnic Italians made up most (or a substantial portion) of the population: the Austrian Littoral, [[Trentino]], [[Rijeka|Fiume]] and [[Dalmatia]]. The [[Triple Entente]] promised the regions to Italy in the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in exchange for Italy's joining the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] in [[World War I]]. The secret 1915 [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] promised Italy territories largely inhabited by Italians (such as Trentino) in addition to those largely inhabited by [[Croats]] or [[Slovenes]]; the territories contained about 327,000 (out of total population of 1.3 million) ethnic Slovenes.&lt;ref name="SacroEgoismo2012"&gt;Lipušček, U.

A contemporary Italian autonomous region, bordering on [[Slovenia]], is named [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] ("[[Friuli]] and Julian Venetia").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giulianinelmondo.it/upload/history.pdf "The History of "Venetia Julia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425044410/http://www.giulianinelmondo.it/upload/history.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Origin of the name}}Etymology==
The term "Julian March" may be considered a loose translation of the Italian "Venezia Giulia" (or "Julian Venetia"), coined by the Italian historical linguist [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli|Graziadio Ascoli]]. In an 1863 newspaper article,&lt;ref name ="Cattaruzza"/&gt; Ascoli focused on a wide geographical area north and east of [[Venice]] which was under [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] rule; he called it [[Triveneto]] ("the three Venetian regions"). Ascoli divided Triveneto into three parts:
*Euganean Venetia (''Venezia Euganea'' or ''Venezia propria''; Venetia in the strict sense), made up of Italy's [[Veneto]] region and most of the territory of [[Friuli]] (roughly corresponding to the present Italian provinces of [[Province of Udine|Udine]] and [[Province of Pordenone|Pordenone]])
*Tridentine Venetia (''[[Venezia Tridentina]]''): the present Italian region of [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]]
*Julian Venetia (''Venezia Giulia''): "[[Province of Gorizia|Gorizia]], [[Province of Trieste|Trieste]] and [[Istria]] ... including the land between the Venetia in the strict sense of the term, the [[Julian Alps]], and the sea"&lt;ref name ="Cattaruzza"/&gt;

According to this definition, Triveneto overlaps the ancient Roman region of ''Regio X - Venetia et Histria'' introduced by Emperor [[Augustus]] in his administrative reorganization of Italy at the beginning of the first century AD. Ascoli (who was born in Gorizia) coined his terms for linguistic and cultural reasons, saying that the languages spoken in the three areas were substantially similar. His goal was to stress to the ruling Austrian Empire the region's&lt;ref&gt;In 1863 all of the Triveneto, as defined by Ascoli, was part of the Austrian Empire. After the Italian [[Third Italian War of Independence|third war of independence]] against Austria of 1866, Veneto and part of Friuli (i. e. Venezia Euganea in Ascoli's terms) were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin language|Latin]] and Venetian roots and the importance of the Italian linguistic element.&lt;ref name ="Cattaruzza"/&gt;

The term "Venezia Giulia" did not catch on immediately, and began to be used widely only in the first decade of the 20th century.&lt;ref name ="Cattaruzza"/&gt; It was used in official administrative acts by the Italian government in 1922–1923 and after 1946, when it was included in the name of the new region of [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]].

==={{anchor|From the early Middle Ages to the fall of Venice Republic}}Early Middle Ages to the Republic of Venice===
At the end of the [[Roman Empire]] and the beginning of the [[Migration Period]], the area had linguistic boundaries between speakers of [[Latin language|Latin]] (and its [[Vulgar Latin|dialects]]) and the [[Germanic languages|German-]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic-language]] speakers who were moving into the region. [[Germanic peoples|German tribes]] first arrived in present-day [[History of Austria#Migration period|Austria]] and its surrounding areas between the fourth and sixth centuries. They were followed by the [[great migration of the Slavs|Slavs]], who appeared on the borders of the [[Byzantine Empire]] around the sixth century and settled in the [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|Eastern Alps]] between the sixth and eighth centuries. In Byzantine [[Dalmatia (theme)|Dalmatia]], on the east shore of the [[Adriatic Sea]], several [[Dalmatian city-states|city-states]] had limited autonomy. The Slavs retained their languages in the interior, and local [[Romance languages]] (followed by [[venetian language|Venetian]] and [[italian language|Italian]]) continued to be spoken on the coast.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jože Pirjevec]], ''Serbi croati sloveni'', Il Mulino, 2002, {{ISBN|978-88-15-08824-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beginning in the [[early Middle Ages]], two main political powers shaped the region: the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] (the dukes and, later, archdukes of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]]). During the 11th century, Venice began building an overseas empire (''[[Stato da Màr]]'') to establish and protect its commercial routes in the Adriatic and southeastern [[Mediterranean Sea]]s. Coastal areas of [[Istria]] and [[Dalmazia]] were key parts of these routes{{efn|Adriatic routes to and from Venice were based on Dalmatian and Istrian harbours, which were more easily accessible for vessels than their Italian counterparts.}} since [[Pietro II Orseolo]], the [[Doge of Venice]], established Venetian rule in the high and middle Adriatic around 1000.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;F. C. Lane, ''Venice.  A maritime Republic'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;. The Venetian presence was concentrated on the coast, replacing Byzantine rule and confirming the political and linguistic separation between coast and interior. The [[Republic of Venice]] began expanding toward the Italian interior (''[[Stato da Tera]]'') in 1420,&lt;ref name=Lane/&gt;, acquiring the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (state)|Patriarchate of Aquileia]] (which included a portion of modern [[Friuli]]—the present-day provinces of [[Pordenone]] and [[Udine]]—and part of internal Istria).

The [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] held the [[March of Carniola]], roughly corresponding to the central [[Carniola]]n region of present-day [[Slovenia]] (part of their holdings in [[Inner Austria]]), since 1335. During the next two centuries, they gained control of the Istrian cities of [[Pazin]] and [[Rijeka|Rijeka-Fiume]], the port of [[Trieste]] (with [[Duino]]), [[Gradisca d'Isonzo|Gradisca]] and [[Gorizia]] (with its [[County of Gorizia|county]] in [[Friuli]]).

==={{anchor|From the fall of Venice Republic to the end of I World War}}Republic of Venice to 1918===
The region was relatively stable from the 16th century to the 1797 [[fall of the Republic of Venice]], which was marked by the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] between Austria and France. The Habsburgs gained Venetian lands on the [[Istria|Istrian Peninsula]] and the [[Kvarner Gulf|Quarnero]] (Kvarner) islands, expanded their holdings in 1813 with [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s defeats and the dissolution of the French [[Illyrian provinces]]. Austria gained most of the republic's territories, including the Adriatic coast, Istria and portions of present-day [[Croatia]] (such as the city of [[Karlovac|Karlstadt]]). 

Habsburg rule abolished political borders which had divided the area for almost 1,000 years. The territories were initially assigned to the new [[Kingdom of Illyria (1816–1849)|Kingdom of Illyria]], which became the [[Austrian Littoral]] in 1849. This was established as a [[crown land]] (''Kronland'') of the Austrian Empire, consisting of three regions: the Istrian peninsula, [[Gorizia and Gradisca]], and the city of [[Trieste]].&lt;ref&gt;Veneto, including western part of modern Friuli, which had also become part of Austrian Empire since 1815, was included in the Kingdom of [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia|Lombardo-Veneto]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Third Italian War of Independence|Italian-Austrian war of 1866]], followed by the passage of what was then known as Veneto (the current [[Veneto]] and [[Friuli]] regions, except for the province of [[Gorizia]]) to Italy, did not directly affect the Littoral; however, a small community of Slavic speakers in northeastern Friuli (an area known as [[Slavia Friulana|Slavia friulana - Beneška Slovenija]]) became part of the Kingdom of Italy. Otherwise, the Littoral lasted until the end of the Austrian Empire in 1918.

{{See also|Battles of the Isonzo|Slovene minority in Italy (1920–1947)|Foibe massacres}}

Now part of the Kingdom of Italy, the new region included the [[County of Gorizia and Gradisca]], [[Trieste]], Istria, the current Italian municipalities of [[Tarvisio]], [[Pontebba]] and [[Malborghetto Valbruna]], and partially  and fully Slovene portions of the former Austrian Littoral. Exceptions were the island of [[Krk]] and the municipality of [[Kastav]], which became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://razor.arnes.si/~mkralj/istra-history/e-periodtotal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111164234/http://razor.arnes.si/~mkralj/istra-history/e-periodtotal.html |archivedate=2008-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rijeka|Rijeka-Fiume]] became a [[city-state]], the [[Free State of Fiume]], before it was abolished in 1924 and divided between Italy and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

The new provinces of Gorizia (which was merged with the [[Province of Udine]] between 1924 and 1927), Trieste, [[Pula|Pola]] and Fiume (after 1924) were created. Italians lived primarily in cities and along the coast, and Slavs inhabited the interior. [[Italian fascism|Fascist]] persecution, "centralising, oppressive and dedicated to the forcible Italianisation of the minorities",&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1C0mJLFrpC0C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=centralizing,+oppressive+and+dedicated+to+the+forcible+Italianization+of+the+minorities&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U1JjDM7NeFfbl-_W3DuNjZmdDq4eA The Problem of Trieste and the Italo-Yugoslav Border by Glenda Sluga, p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt; caused the emigration of about 105,000&lt;ref name=Cresciani_ClashOfCivilisations/&gt; [[Slovenes]] and [[Croats]] from the Julian March—around 70,000 to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and 30,000 to [[Argentina]]. Several thousand [[Dalmatian Italians]] moved from Yugoslavia to Italy after 1918, many to Istria and Trieste.

In response to the [[Fascist Italianization]] of Slovene areas, the [[Militant anti-fascism|militant anti-Fascist]] organization [[TIGR]] emerged in 1927. TIGR co-ordinated Slovene resistance against [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] until it was dismantled by the [[OVRA|secret police]] in 1941, and some former members joined the [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. The [[Slovene Partisans]] emerged that year in the occupied [[Province of Ljubljana]], and spread by 1942 to the other Slovene areas which had been annexed by Kingdom of Italy twenty years earlier.

===German occupation and resistance (1943–1945)===
After the [[Italian armistice]] of September 1943, many local uprisings took place. The town of [[Gorizia]] was temporarily liberated by partisans, and a liberated zone in the Upper [[Soča]] Valley known as the Kobarid Republic lasted from September to November 1943. The [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] began to occupy the region and encountered severe resistance from Yugoslav partisans, particularly in the lower [[Vipava Valley]] and the Alps. Most of the lowlands were occupied by the winter of 1943, but Yugoslav resistance remained active throughout the region and withdrew to the mountains.

In the aftermath of the fall 1943 Italian armistice, the first of what became known as the [[Foibe massacres]] occurred (primarily in present-day Croatian Istria). The Germans established the [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]], officially part of the [[Italian Social Republic]] but under ''de facto'' German administration, that year. Many areas, (especially north and north-east of Gorizia) were controlled by the partisan resistance, which was also active on the [[Karst Plateau]] and interior Istria. The Nazis tried to repress the Yugoslav guerrillas with reprisals against the civilian population; entire villages were burned down, and thousands of people were interned in [[Nazi concentration camps]]. However, the Yugoslav resistance took over most of the region by the spring of 1945.

Italian resistance in the operational zone was active in [[Friuli]] and weaker in the Julian March, where it was confined to intelligence and underground resistance in the larger towns (especially [[Trieste]] and [[Pula]]). In May 1945, the Yugoslav Army entered Trieste; over the following days, virtually the entire Julian March was occupied by Yugoslav forces. Retaliation against real (and potential) political opponents occurred, primarily to the Italian population.

[[File:Confini Trieste-Istria2.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour-coded map of Trieste|225px|Division of the Julian March between June 1945 and September 1947, with the [[Morgan Line]] in red]]

The Western allies adopted the term "Julian March" as the name for the territories which were contested between Italy and the [[People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] between 1945 and 1947. The [[Morgan Line]] was drawn in June 1945, dividing the region into two militarily administered zones. Zone B was under Yugoslav administration and excluded the cities of Pula, Gorizia, Trieste, the [[Soča]] Valley and most of the Karst Plateau, which were under joint British-American administration. During this period, many Italians left the Yugoslav-occupied area.

In 1946, U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] ordered an increase in U.S. troops in their occupation zone (Zone A) and the reinforcement of air forces in northern Italy after Yugoslav forces shot down two U.S. Army transport planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://7499thgroupreunions.com/ELINT.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409010948/http://7499thgroupreunions.com/ELINT.aspx |archivedate=2009-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement on the border was chosen from four proposed solutions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.pucminas.br/mini-onu/6_edicao/arquivos/update_ppc.doc The Italo-Yugoslav Border Issue: Four Solutions And The Urgent Need For Just One]{{full citation needed|date=August 2013}} {{dead link|date=April 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1946|Paris Peace Conference]] that year. Yugoslavia acquired the northern part of the region east of Gorizia, most of Istria and the city of Fiume. A [[Free Territory of Trieste]] was created, divided into two zones—one under Allied and the other under Yugoslav military administration. Tensions continued, and in 1954 the territory was abolished and divided between Italy (which received the city of Trieste and its surroundings) and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://untreaty.un.org/unts/1_60000/6/40/00011990.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319050927/http://untreaty.un.org/unts/1_60000/6/40/00011990.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Slovenia the Julian March is known as the [[Slovene Littoral]], encompassing the regions of [[Goriška]] and Slovenian Istria and (sometimes) the Slovene-speaking areas of the provinces of Gorizia and Trieste. In Croatia, the traditional name of Istria is used. After the divisions of 1947 and 1954, the term "Julian March" survived in the name of the [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] region of Italy.

[[File:Istria (ethnic).JPG|thumb|alt=Another colour-coded map|200px|1880 ethnolinguistic map of Istria. Italian areas are shown in blue, Slovene areas in green and Croat areas in aquamarine.]]

Two major ethnolinguistic clusters were unified in the region. The western portion was inhabited primarily by [[Italians]] ([[Italian language|Italian]], [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and [[Friulian language|Friulian]] were the three major languages), with a small [[Istriot language|Istriot-speaking]] minority. The eastern and northern areas were inhabited by [[South Slavs]] ([[Slovenes]] and [[Croats]]), with small [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] ([[Peroj]]) and [[Serbs|Serb]] minorities.

Other ethnic groups included [[Istro-Romanians]] in eastern [[Istria]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthian]] [[Ethnic Germans|Germans]] in the [[Canale Valley]] and smaller [[German language|German-]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]-speaking communities in larger urban centres, primarily members of the former [[Austro-Hungarian]] élite. This is illustrated by the 1855 ethnographic map of the Austrian Empire compiled by Karl von Czoernig-Czernhausen and issued by the Austrian [[Imperial and Royal|''k.&amp;nbsp;u.&amp;nbsp;k.'']] department of statistics. According to the 1910–1911 Austrian census, the Austrian Littoral (which would be annexed by Italy from 1920 to 1924) had a population of 978,385. Italian was the everyday language (''Umgangsprache'') of 421,444 people (43.1 percent); 327,230 (33.4 percent) spoke Slovene, and 152,500 (15.6 percent) spoke Croatian.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jože Pirjevec]] and [[Milica Kacin Wohinz]] (Ljubljana: [[Nova revija (publishing company)|Nova revija]], 2000), p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; About 30,000 people (3.1 percent) spoke German, 3,000 (0.3 percent) spoke Hungarian, and small clusters of [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]] and [[Czech language|Czech]] speakers existed. The [[Friulian language|Friulian]], [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and [[Istriot language]]s were considered Italian; an estimated 60,000 or more "Italian" speakers (about 14 percent) spoke Friulian.&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Wörsdörfer, ''Krisenherd Adria 1915–1955: Konstruktion und Artikulation des Nationalen im italienisch-jugoslawischen Grenzraum'' (Paderborn : F. Schöningh, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romance languages===
[[File:Istria census 1910.PNG|thumb|200px|alt=Colour-coded map of Istria|Percentage of native Italian (including Venetian and Istriot) speakers in Istria, according to the 1910 Austrian census]]

The standard [[Italian language]] was common among educated people in Trieste, [[Gorizia]], Istria and Rijeka|Rijeka-Fiume. In Trieste (and to a lesser extent in Istria), Italian was the predominant language in primary education. The Italian-speaking élite dominated the governments of Trieste and Istria under Austro-Hungarian rule, although they were increasingly challenged by Slovene and Croatian political movements. Before 1918, Trieste was the only self-governing Austro-Hungarian unit in which Italian speakers were the majority of the population.

Most of the [[Romance languages|Romance-speaking]] population did not speak standard Italian as their native language, but two other closely related Romance languages: Friulian and Venetian.&lt;ref&gt;It should be understood that Italian language's division among regional dialects has always been very pronounced. Due to the lack of a central Italian state, a standard Italian language did not actually exist until the second half of the 19th century, nor there was, until then, an agreement among scholars on this language's features.  As a result, only 2.5% of Italy's population could speak the Italian standardized language properly when the nation was unified in 1861. See for example the [[Italian language#History|Italian language historic evolution]] and {{cite book|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ita |editor=M. Paul Lewis|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World|edition=16th|publisher=Ethnologue.com |date=2009 |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no attempt to introduce Venetian into education and administration.

Friulian was spoken in the south-western lowlands of the county of Gorizia and Gradisca (except for the Monfalcone-Grado area, where Venetian was spoken), and in the town of [[Gorizia]]. Larger Friulian-speaking centres included [[Cormons]], [[Cervignano]], and [[Gradisca d'Isonzo]]. A dialect of Friulian (Tergestine) was spoken in Trieste and [[Muggia]], evolving into a Venetian dialect during the 18th century. According to contemporary estimates, three-quarters of the Italians in the county of Gorizia and Gradisca were native Friulian speakers—one-quarter of the county's population, and seven to eight percent of the population of the Julian March.

Venetian dialects were concentrated in Trieste, Rijeka and Istria, and the Istro-Venetian dialect was the predominant language of the west Istrian coast. In many small west Istrian towns, such as [[Koper]] (Capodistria), [[Piran]] (Pirano) or [[Poreč]] (Parenzo), the Venetian-speaking majority reached 90&amp;nbsp;percent of the population and 100 percent in [[Umag]] (Umago) and [[Muggia]]. Venetian was also a strong presence on Istria's [[Cres]]-[[Lošinj]] archipelago and in the peninsula's eastern and interior towns such as [[Motovun]], [[Labin]], [[Plomin]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Buzet]] and [[Pazin]]. Although Istro-Venetian was strongest in urban areas, clusters of Venetian-speaking peasants also existed. This was especially true for the area around [[Buje]] and [[Grožnjan]] in north-central Istria, where Venetian spread during the mid-19th century (often in the form of a Venetian-Croat [[pidgin]]). In the county of Gorizia and Gradisca, Venetian was spoken in the area around [[Monfalcone]] and [[Ronchi dei Legionari|Ronchi]] (between the lower [[Isonzo]] River and the Karst Plateau) in an area popularly known as [[Bisiacaria]] and in the town of [[Grado, Italy|Grado]]. In Trieste the local Venetian dialect (known as [[Triestine]]) was widely spoken, although it was the native language of only about half the city's population. In Rijeka-Fiume, a form of Venetian known as [[Fiumano]] emerged during the late 18th and early 19th centuries and became the native language of about half the city's population.

In addition to these two large language groups, two smaller Romance communities existed in Istria. In the south-west, on the coastal strip between Pula and [[Rovinj]], the archaic [[Istriot]] language was spoken. In some villages of eastern Istria, north of [[Labin]], the [[Istro-Romanian language]] was spoken by about 3,000 people.

===South Slavic languages===
[[Slovene language|Slovene]] was spoken in the north-eastern and southern parts of Gorizia and Gradisca (by about 60 percent of the population), in northern Istria and in the [[Inner Carniola]]n areas annexed by Italy in 1920 ([[Postojna]], [[Vipava, Slovenia|Vipava]], [[Ilirska Bistrica]] and [[Idrija]]). It was also the primary language of one-fourth to one-third of the population of Trieste. Smaller Slovene-speaking communities lived in the [[Canale Valley]] ([[Carinthian Slovenes]]), in [[Rijeka]] and in larger towns outside the [[Slovene Lands]] (especially [[Pula]], [[Monfalcone]], [[Gradisca d'Isonzo]] and [[Cormons]]). [[Slavia Friulana|Slavia Friulana - Beneška Slovenija]], the community living since the eighth century in small towns (such as [[Resia, Friuli|Resia]]) in the valleys of the [[Natisone]], [[Torre River|Torre]] and [[Judrio River]]s in [[Friuli]], has been part of Italy since 1866. 

A variety of [[Slovene dialects]] were spoken throughout the region. The Slovene linguistic community in the Julian March was divided into as many as 11 dialects (seven larger and four smaller dialects), belonging to three of the [[Slovene dialects#Regional groups|seven dialect groups]] into which Slovene is divided. Most Slovenes were fluent in standard Slovene, with the exception of some northern Istrian villages (where primary education was in Italian and the [[Slovene national movement]] penetrated only in the late 19th century) and the [[Carinthian Slovenes]] in the Canale Valley, who were [[Germanisation|Germanised]] until 1918 and frequently spoke only the local dialect.

Slovene-Italian bilingualism was present only in some north-west Istrian coastal villages and the confined semi-urban areas around Gorizia and Trieste, while the vast majority of Slovene speakers had little (or no) knowledge of Italian; [[German language|German]] was the predominant second language of the Slovene rural population.

[[Croatian language|Croatian]] was spoken in the central and eastern Istrian peninsula, on the [[Cres]]-[[Lošinj]] archipelago; it was the second-most-spoken language (after Venetian) in the town of [[Rijeka]]. The [[Kajkavian]] dialect of [[Serbo-Croatian]] was spoken around [[Buzet]] in north-central Istria; [[Čakavian]] was predominant in all other areas, frequently with strong Kajkavian and Venetian vocabulary influences. Italian-Croatian [[bilingualism]] was frequent in western Istria, on the Cres-Lošinj archipelago and in Rijeka, but rare elsewhere.

==={{anchor|Other linguistic minorities}}Linguistic minorities===
German was the predominant language in secondary and higher education throughout the region until 1918, and the educated élite were fluent in German. Many Austrian civil servants used German in daily life, especially in larger urban centres. Most of the German speakers would speak Italian, Slovene or Croatian on social and public occasions, depending on their political and ethnic preferences and location. Among the rural population, German was spoken by about 6,000 people in the Canale Valley. In the major urban areas (primarily Trieste and Rijeka), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] were spoken by smaller communities.

'''Landscape limnology''' is the spatially explicit study of [[lake]]s, [[stream]]s, and [[wetland]]s as they interact with freshwater, terrestrial, and human [[landscape]]s to determine the effects of pattern on [[ecosystem]] processes across temporal and spatial scales. [[Limnology]] is the study of inland water bodies inclusive of rivers, lakes, and wetlands; landscape limnology seeks to integrate all of these ecosystem types.

The [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] component represents spatial hierarchies of landscape features that influence which materials, whether solutes or organisms, are transported to [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] systems; aquatic connections represent how these materials are transported; and human activities reflect features that influence how these materials are transported as well as their quantity and temporal dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Soranno, P.A., K.E. Webster, K.S. Cheruvelil and M.T. Bremigan. 2009. The lake landscape-context framework: linking aquatic connections, terrestrial features and human effects at multiple spatial scales. Verhandlungen Internationale Vereinigung für theoretische und angewandte Limnologie. 30:695-700&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==

The core principles or themes of [[landscape ecology]] provide the foundation for landscape limnology. These ideas can be synthesized into a set of four landscape ecology themes that are broadly applicable to any aquatic ecosystem type, and that consider the unique features of such ecosystems. 

'''A landscape limnology framework begins with the premise of Thienemann (1925). Wiens (2002):&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 2002. Riverine landscapes: taking landscape ecology into the water. Freshwater Biology 47:501-515&lt;/ref&gt; freshwater ecosystems can be considered patches.''' As such, the location of these patches and their placement relative to other elements of the landscape is important to the ecosystems and their processes. Therefore, the four main themes of landscape limnology are:

'''(1) Patch characteristics:''' The characteristics of a freshwater ecosystem include its physical morphometry, chemical, and biological features, as well as its boundaries. These boundaries are often more easily defined for aquatic ecosystems than for terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., shoreline, [[riparian zone]]s, and emergent vegetation zone) and are often a focal-point for important ecosystem processes linking terrestrial and aquatic components.

'''(2) Patch context:''' The freshwater ecosystem is embedded in a complex terrestrial mosaic (e.g., soils, geology, and land use/cover) that has been shown to drive many within-ecosystem features and processes such as water chemistry, species richness, and primary and secondary productivity. 

'''(3) Patch connectivity and directionality:''' The complex freshwater mosaic is connected to the particular patch of interest and defines the degree to which materials and organisms move across the landscape through freshwater connections. For freshwater ecosystems, these connections often display a strong directionality component that must be explicitly considered.&lt;ref&gt;Kling, G.W., G.W. Kipphut, M.M. Miller, and J. O’Briens. 2000. Integration of lakes and streams in a landscape perspective: the importance of material processing on spatial patterns and temporal coherence. Freshwater Biology 43: 477-497&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcarelli, A.M. and W.A. Wurtsbaugh. 2007. Effects of upstream lakes and nutrient limitation on periphytic biomass and nitrogen fixation in Oligotrophic, subalpine streams. Freshwater Biology 52:2211-2225&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a specific wetland can be connected through groundwater to other wetlands or lakes, or through surface water connections directly to lakes and rivers, or both, and the directionality of those connections will strongly impact the movement of nutrients and biota.

'''(4) Spatial scale and hierarchy:''' Interactions among terrestrial and freshwater elements occur at multiple spatial scales that must be considered hierarchically. The explicit integration of hierarchy into landscape limnology is important because (a) many freshwater ecosystems are hierarchically organized and controlled by processes that are hierarchically organized,&lt;ref&gt;Frissell, C.A., W.J. Liss, C.E. Warren &amp; M.D. Hurley. 1986. A hierarchical framework for stream habitat classification: viewing streams in a watershed context. Environmental Management 10: 199–214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tonn, W.M 1990"&gt;Tonn, W.M. 1990. Climate change and fish communities: A conceptual framework. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society 119:337-352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poff, N.L. 1997. Landscape filters and species traits: towards mechanistic understanding and prediction in stream ecology. Journal of the North American Benthological Society 16: 391–409&lt;/ref&gt; (b) most freshwater ecosystems are managed at multiple spatial scales, from policy set at the national level, to land management conducted at local scales, and (c) the degree of homogeneity among freshwater ecosystems can change in relation to the scale of observation.

==Contributions to other fields==

Findings from landscape limnology research are contributing to many facets of aquatic ecosystem research, management, and conservation.  Landscape limnology is especially relevant for geographical areas with thousands of ecosystems (i.e. lake-rich regions of the world), in situations with a range of human disturbances, or when considering lakes, streams, and wetlands that are connected to other such ecosystems. For example, landscape limnology perspectives have contributed to the development of nutrient criteria for lakes,&lt;ref&gt;Soranno, P.A., K.S. Cheruvelil, R.J. Stevenson, S.L. Rollins, S.W. Holden, S. Heaton, and E.K. Torng. 2008. A framework for developing ecosystem-specific nutrient criteria: Integrating biological thresholds with predictive modeling. Limnology and Oceanography 53(2): 773-787&lt;/ref&gt; formation of classification systems that can be used to monitor the health of aquatic ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;Cheruvelil, K.S., P.A. Soranno, M.T. Bremigan, T. Wagner, and S.L. Martin. 2008. Grouping lakes for water quality assessment and monitoring: the roles of regionalization and spatial scale. Environmental Management. 41:425-440&lt;/ref&gt; understanding ecosystem responses to environmental stressors,&lt;ref&gt;Baker, L. A., A.T. Herlihy, P.R. Kaufmann, and J.M. Eilers. 1991.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4159">'''Landscaping''' refers to any activity that modifies the visible features of an area of land, including:

# living [[organism|elements]], such as [[flora]] or [[fauna]]; or what is commonly called [[gardening]], the art and craft of growing plants with a goal of creating a beauty within the [[landscape]].
# natural elements such as [[landform]]s, [[terrain]] shape and elevation, or [[water body|bodies of water]]; and
# abstract elements such as the [[weather]] and lighting conditions.
Landscaping requires expertise in [[horticulture]] and artistic design.

== Understanding the land ==

Construction requires study and observation. It is not the same in different parts of the world. Landscaping varies according to different [[region]]s.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diekelmann|first1=John|last2=Schuster|first2=Robert M.|title=Natural Landscaping: Designing with Native Plant Communities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fmajmru4g98C|year=2002|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-17324-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, normally local natural experts are recommended if it is done for the first time. Understanding of the site is one of the chief essentials for successful landscaping. Different natural features like terrain, [[topography]], [[soil quality|soil qualities]], prevailing winds, depth of the [[frost line]], and the system of [[Native plant|native flora]] and fauna must be taken into account.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingels|first=Jack|title=Landscaping Principles and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ8XYcUOdI0C|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-4283-7641-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the land is not fit for landscaping. In order to landscape it, the land must be reshaped. This reshaping of land is called [[Grading (engineering)|grading]].&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;

[[Earth mover|Removal of earth]] from the land is called cutting while when earth is added to the slope, it is called filling. Sometimes the grading process may involve removal of excessive waste ([[landfill]]s), [[soil]] and rocks, so designers should take into account while in the planning stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slack|first=William|title=Landscaping|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwUTtPGct40C|year=1998|publisher=Oxmoor House|isbn=978-0-8487-2251-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Rita|title=Taylor's Master Guide to Landscaping|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-NnzL1gJeIC|year=2000|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-618-05590-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==

In the start, the [[landscaping contractor]] makes a letter which is a rough design and layout of what could be done with the land in order to achieve the desired outcome.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; Different pencils are required to make graphics of the picture. Landscaping has become more technological than natural, as few projects begin without [[bulldozers]], [[lawnmowers]], or [[chainsaws]].&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; Different areas have different qualities of plants.  When growing new grass, it should ideally be done in the spring and the fall seasons to maximize growth and to minimize the spread of weeds. It is generally agreed that [[Fertilizers]] are required for good plant growth. Some landscapers prefer to use mix [[gravel]] with rocks of varying sizes to add interest in large areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sharon Cohoon and Jim McCausland |url=http://www.landscapingorlandopros.com/ |title=How to Landscape Gravel - Page 2 |publisher=Sunset.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319025558/http://www.sunset.com/garden/landscaping-design/landscaping-with-gravel-00400000011687/page2.html |archivedate=March 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lielupe''' (in [[Latvian language|Latvian]] [[Literal translation|literally]]: ''Large River'', {{lang-lt|Lielupė}}, {{lang-de|Kurländische Aa}}) is a river in central [[Latvia]]. Its length is 119&amp;nbsp;km (the length would reach 310&amp;nbsp;km if the [[Mēmele River]] were counted as part of the Lielupe). The surface area of its drainage basin is 17,600 km².&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/Profile_segments/LVA-WR_eng.stm Aquastat information for Latvia] &lt;/ref&gt; The average fall of the Lielupe is about (.1 meter/kilometer) and its average flow is 106 m³/s, although a maximum of 1380 m³/s has been reached during floods.

== Physical geography ==
[[File:Lielupe river at Jelgava by Igors Jefimovs.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Lielupe near [[Jelgava]], [[Latvia]].]]
The Lielupe begins at the confluence of the [[Mēmele]] and [[Mūsa]] rivers near [[Bauska]]. For the upper part of its course, the river flows through a dolomite valley with a few small rapids, until it reaches [[Mežotne]], where it widens and deepens over the flat [[Zemgale]] Plain. For many years the Lielupe would frequently overflow its shallow banks and flood surrounding fields and villages, particularly during the spring thaw. Today many parts of the Lielupe's banks are contained with earthen dikes to prevent disastrous floods. Much of the Lielupe is covered in river grasses. At its lower reaches, the river flows parallel to the coast line of the [[Gulf of Riga]]; the city of [[Jūrmala]] stretches for almost 30&amp;nbsp;km between the river and the sea. Eventually the Lielupe flows into the Baltic Sea, while the Buļļupe branch ({{lang-de|Kurische Aa}}) flows into the [[Daugava River]]. The modern mouth of the river appeared in 1755. Before then the Buļļupe was the Lielupe's main channel.
{{stack|[[File:Lielupe Baltic Sea aerial.jpg|thumb|upright|The Lielupe flows into the [[Baltic Sea]], while the Buļļupe branch flows towards the [[Daugava River|Daugava]] River to the northeast.]]}}
About 50-55% of the water discharge of the river is from melted snow. The Lielupe is navigable for a range of 100&amp;nbsp;km, the longest continuous range among Latvian rivers. Municipalities along the river include [[Bauska]], [[Mežotne]], [[Jelgava]], [[Kalnciems]], [[Jūrmala]] and [[Riga]].

The Lielupe also gives its name to a railway station and a neighbourhood in the city of Jūrmala.

This is an incomplete list of [[Belgian]] [[supercentenarian]]s (people living in Belgium who have attained at least 110 years of age). The [[Gerontology Research Group]] (GRG), an organization that tracks supercentenarians and verifies age claims, has verified 20 supercentenarians, including emigrant supercentenarians, from Belgium.&lt;ref name="GRG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://supercentenarian-research-foundation.org/TableE.aspx |title=Validated Living Supercentenarians |date=12 September 2015 |accessdate=13 September 2015 |publisher=[[Gerontology Research Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Belgian ever was Joanna Deroover, who died in 2002 aged 112 years 186 days.&lt;ref name="GRGI"&gt;[http://grg.org/Adams/I.HTM GRG VERIFIED SUPERCENTENARIAN CASES -- LISTED CHRONOLOGICALLY BY DEATH DATE as of 28 April 2007] Retrieved 6 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the death of 110-year-old Madeleine Dullier on 20 April 2018, the oldest living Belgian person is Elisabeth de Proost, born 5 February 1908, aged {{ayd|1908|2|5}}.&lt;ref name=dullier-death&gt;https://www.hln.be/nieuws/binnenland/oudste-belg-overleden-madeleine-zou-volgende-week-111-geworden-zijn~ade9b4adc/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24464">These lists give the [[U.S. state|state]]s of primary affiliation and of birth for each [[President of the United States|President]] of the [[United States]].

==Birth places==
Twenty-one states claim the distinction of being the birthplace of a president. One president's ''birth state'' is in dispute; North and South Carolina (British colonies at the time) both lay claim to Andrew Jackson, who was born in 1767, in the [[Waxhaws|Waxhaw region]] along their common border. Jackson himself considered South Carolina as his birth state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/06/AR2011030603406.html?wprss=rss_print/asection|title=Old fight lingers over Old Hickory's roots|last=Collings|first=Jeffrey|date=March 7, 2011|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=The Washington Post Company|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born on December 5, 1782, [[Martin Van Buren]] was the first president born an [[American citizen]] (and not a [[British subject]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Glass| first=Andrew| date=July 21, 2014| title=Van Buren slips into coma, July 21, 1862| publisher=Politico| location=Arlington County, Virginia| url=https://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/this-day-in-politics-martin-van-buren-coma-109149| accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term [[Virginia dynasty]] is sometimes used to describe the fact that four of the first five U.S. presidents were from Virginia. The number of presidents born per state, counting Jackson as being from South Carolina, are:
* One: [[Arkansas]], [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Hawaii]], [[Illinois]], [[Iowa]], [[Kentucky]], [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[South Carolina]]
* Two: [[North Carolina]], [[Texas]], and [[Vermont]]
* Four: [[Massachusetts]]
* Five: [[New York (state)|New York]]
* Seven: [[Ohio]]
* Eight: [[Virginia]]

== Presidential birthplace and early childhood historic sites ==
The birthplaces and early childhood residences of many U.S. presidents have been preserved or replicated. In instances where a physical structure is absent, a monument or roadside marker has been erected to denote the site's historic significance. All sites in the table below are listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

A dramatic shift in childbirth from home to hospital occurred in the United States in the early 20th century (mid–1920s to 1940).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomasson|first1=Melissa A.|last2=Treber|first2=Jaret|date=January 2008|title=From home to hospital: The evolution of childbirth in the United States, 1928-1940|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014498307000241|journal=Explorations in Economic History|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands|publisher=Elsevier|volume=45|issue=1|pages=76–99|accessdate=December 5, 2017|doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2007.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflective of this trend, all presidents born after [[World War II]] (Bill Clinton and every president since) have been born in a hospital, not a private residence.

== States of primary affiliation ==
A list of U.S. Presidents including the state with which each was primarily affiliated, due to residence, professional career, and electoral history. This is not necessarily the state in which the president was born. Nineteen Presidents (denoted with an asterisk) primarily resided in states other than their respective birth states, which are listed above.

::''For the consorts of the Latin emperors, see, [[List of Latin Empresses]].''

This is a list of the [[Queen consort|consort]]s of the four main [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] successor states of the [[Byzantine Empire]] following the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204 and up to their conquest by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the middle of the 15th century. These states were [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], and the [[Despotate of Morea|Morea]]. The last two never actually claimed the imperial title, except briefly under [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] in the late 1220s, who began as ruler of Epirus but crowned himself emperor in Thessalonica.

== Empress of [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] ==
The consorts of rulers of Trebizond, like their counterparts in the other two Byzantine successor states, the Empire of Nicaea and the Despotate of Epirus, initially claimed the traditional Byzantine title of ''Empress consort the Romans''. However, after reaching an agreement with the restored Byzantine Empire in 1282, the official title of the consorts of Trebizond was changed to ''Empress consort of the entire East, of the Iberians and the Perateia'' and remained such until the Empire's end in 1461. The state is sometimes called the Komnenian or Megalokomnenian empire from its ruling dynasty.  Trebizond had three reigning empresses, [[Theodora of Trebizond]] (1284–1285), [[Irene Palaiologina of Trebizond|Irene Palaiologina]] (1340–1341), and [[Anna of Trebizond]] (1341–1342).

== Byzantine Empresses in [[pretext|pretence]] after 1453 ==
The [[Byzantine Empire]] fell in 1453.  Three pretenders from the dynasty followed. The last Palaiologan pretender, [[Andreas Palaiologos]], sold his right to the imperial succession to [[Charles VIII of France]], but he also willed the imperial titles to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castille]], and so in a sense either the  [[List of French consorts|French]] [[List of Spanish consorts|Spanish queens]] have been the titular Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire since the 15th century.  Another Palaiologan, [[Manuel Palaiologos]], sold his right of succession to [[Bayazid II|Ottoman Sultan Bayazid II]] (the Ottoman sultans already claim to be the Kaizer-i Rum or Roman Emperor); but since there is no such thing as a sultaness, there are no Ottoman consorts. Not counting the Ottoman, the two successors of the Palaiologans were all [[Catholic]] instead of [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]].

'''Mount Karthala''' or '''Karthola''' ({{lang-ar|القرطالة}} ''Al Qirtālah'') is an active [[volcano]] and the highest point of the [[Comoros]] at {{Convert|2361|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. It is the southernmost and larger of the two [[shield volcano]]es forming [[Grande Comore]] island, the largest [[island]] in the nation of Comoros. The Karthala volcano is very active, having erupted more than 20 times since the 19th century. Frequent eruptions have shaped the volcano’s 3&amp;nbsp;km by 4&amp;nbsp;km summit [[caldera]], but the island has largely escaped broad destruction. Eruptions on April 17, 2005 and May 29, 2006 ended a period of quiet.

==April 2005 eruption==
[[Image:Karthala MODIS 20051125.jpg|left|thumb| Satellite image of Karthala volcano after its November 2005 eruption-ash completely obscures Grande Comore (outlined) as well as some other islands.]]
The eruption, which carried a risk of [[lava flow]]s and deadly [[volcanic gas]], caused the evacuation of 30,000 residents.

The crater was clearly changed by the April 2005 eruption. A grey field of ash surrounds the crater and the [[caldera]] itself seems larger and deeper. The [[crater lake]], which formed after Karthala's last eruption in 1991 and once dominated the caldera, is now gone completely. In its place were rough, dark grey rocks, possibly cooling lava or rubble from the collapsed crater.

==May 2006 activity==
On May 29, [[Reuters]] reported that residents of [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]] could see lava at the top of the volcano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=scienceNews&amp;storyID=2006-05-29T082108Z_01_L29707275_RTRUKOC_0_US-COMOROS-VOLCANO.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004140853/http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=scienceNews&amp;storyID=2006-05-29T082108Z_01_L29707275_RTRUKOC_0_US-COMOROS-VOLCANO.xml |archivedate=2009-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few days the volcanic activity subsided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/B590859.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
The mountain is covered by moist evergreen forest up to about 1800&amp;nbsp;metres above sea-level. Higher up the vegetation consists of stunted trees and [[heathland]] where the giant heather ''[[Erica comorensis]]'' grows.

Many of the species found on the mountain are unique to the Comoros and four [[bird]] species are found only on the slopes of Mount Karthala: [[Humblot's flycatcher]], [[Comoro white-eye]], [[Comoro drongo]] and [[Karthala scops owl]].

The mountain's forest is threatened by [[logging]] and the spread of agriculture. A [[nature reserve]] has been proposed to cover the mountain; it has not yet been created.

The '''Oba (''king'') of Lagos''' is the traditional, yet ceremonial, sovereign of [[Lagos]], a coastal Yoruba settlement that went on to become the largest city in [[Africa]] after first giving its name to [[Lagos State]], the acclaimed financial heart of contemporary [[Nigeria]]. The king has no political power, but is sought as a counsel or sponsor by Nigerian politicians who seek support from the various residents of Lagos.  Among other ceremonial roles, the [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] also plays a central part in the [[Eyo festival]] as well as indulging in tourism advertisements on behalf of the city, often stating, "you've gotta go to Lagos".

==History==

All Obas of Lagos trace their lineage to [[Ashipa]],&lt;ref name="Mann-45"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Kristin|title=Slavery and the Birth of an African City: Lagos, 1760-1900|publisher=Indiana University Press, 2007|isbn=9780253348845|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; a war captain of the [[Oba of Benin]]. Ashipa was rewarded with title of ''Oloriogun''&lt;ref name="JHK"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herskovits Kopytoff|first1=Jean|title=A Preface to Modern Nigeria: The "Sierra Leoneans" in Yoruba, 1830 - 1890|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|pages=64–65|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or ''War leader'') and received the Oba of Benin's sanction to govern Lagos.&lt;ref name=Folami&gt;{{cite book|last1=Folami|first1=Takiu|title=A History of Lagos, Nigeria: The Shaping of an African City|publisher=Exposition Press|isbn=9780682497725|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Benin accounts of history have the Ashipa as son or grandson of the Oba of Benin.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=The Lagos Consulate, 1851-1861|publisher=University of California Press, 1979|isbn=9780520037465|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other accounts note that Ashipa is a [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] corruption of the [[Edo language|Benin]] name ''Aisika-hienbore'' (translated "we shall not desert this place").&lt;ref name ="Cole"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Patrick|title=Modern and Traditional Elites in the Politics of Lagos|publisher=Cambridge University Press, 1975|isbn=9780521204392|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashipa received a sword and royal drum as symbols of his authority from the Oba of Benin on his mission to Lagos. Additionally, the [[Oba of Benin]] deployed a group of Benin officers charged with preserving Benin's interests in Lagos. These officers, led by [[Eletu Odibo]], were the initial members of the ''Akarigbere'' class of Lagos White Cap Chiefs.&lt;ref name="JHK" /&gt;

Prior to the arrival of the British, the Oba of Benin had "the undisputed right to crown or confirm the individual whom the people of Lagos elect[ed] to be their King".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|accessdate=8 September 2017
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of Oba [[Kosoko]] by British forces on December 28, 1851, in what is now known as the [[Bombardment of Lagos]] or [[Reduction of Lagos]], or locally as Ogun Ahoyaya or Ogun Agidingbi (after boiling cannons), put an end to Lagos' s former allegiance to the Oba of Benin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

  accessdate =26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosoko was therefore the last Oba of Lagos to remit annual tributes from the people of Lagos to the Oba of Benin. Oba [[Akitoye]], who was re-installed to the throne by the British, "seized the opportunity of his restoration under British protection to repudiate his former allegiance" to Benin and rebuffed subsequent tribute requests from the Oba of Benin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ryder|first1=Alan Frederick Charles|title=Benin and the Europeans: 1485-1897|publisher=Front Cover Alan Frederick Charles Ryder Humanities Press, 1969 - Benin|pages=241–242|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  book|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=The Lagos Consulate, 1851-1861|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0333240545|pages=6,27,90,102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ryder|first1=Alan Frederick Charles|title=Benin and the Europeans: 1485-1897|publisher=Humanities Press, 1969 - Benin|pages=241–242|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous rulers of Lagos have used the titles of [[Ologun Kutere|Ologun]] (derived from Oloriogun), [[Eshugbayi Eleko|Eleko]] and, most recently, Oba of Lagos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

The current Oba of Lagos, His Highness Oba [[Rilwan Akiolu]], has served in the position since May 2003.

==The Royal Seat==
The official residence of the king, since 1630, is [[Iga Idunganran]], a castle constructed by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] over the course of close to a century. It is today a very popular tourist site.

{{Five oceans}}

The '''Pacific Ocean''' is the largest and deepest of [[Earth]]'s [[ocean]]ic divisions. It extends from the [[Arctic Ocean]] in the north to the [[Southern Ocean]] (or, depending on definition, to [[Antarctica]]) in the south and is bounded by [[Asia]] and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] in the west and the [[Americas]] in the east.

At {{convert|165,250,000|km2|sp=us|abbr=off}} in area (as defined with an Antarctic southern border), this largest division of the [[World Ocean]]—and, in turn, the [[hydrosphere]]—covers about 46% of Earth's water surface and about one-third of its total surface area, making it larger than all of Earth's land area combined.&lt;ref name="ebc"&gt;"[https://www.britannica.com/place/Pacific-Ocean Pacific Ocean]". ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica|Britannica Concise]].'' 2008: Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The centers of both the [[Land and water hemispheres|Water Hemisphere]] and the [[Western Hemisphere]] are in the Pacific Ocean. The [[equator]] subdivides it into the '''North Pacific Ocean''' and '''South Pacific Ocean''', with two exceptions: the [[Galápagos Islands|Galápagos]] and [[Gilbert Islands]], while straddling the equator, are deemed wholly within the South Pacific.&lt;ref name="IHO1953"&gt;{{cite web|author=International Hydrographic Organization|date=1953|url=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas|edition=3rd

The [[Mariana Trench]] in the western North Pacific is the deepest point in the world, reaching a depth of {{convert|10,911|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/atlas/technology/tec03.html|title=Japan Atlas: Japan Marine Science and Technology Center|accessdate=4 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The western Pacific has many peripheral [[sea]]s.

Though the peoples of Asia and Oceania have traveled the Pacific Ocean since prehistoric times, the eastern Pacific was first sighted by Europeans in the early 16th century when Spanish explorer [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] in 1513 and discovered the great "southern sea" which he named ''Mar del Sur'' (in Spanish). The ocean's current name was coined by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] during the Spanish [[circumnavigation]] of the world in 1521, as he encountered favorable winds on reaching the ocean. He called it ''Mar Pacífico'', which in both [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] means "peaceful sea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09526b.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Ferdinand Magellan |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 October 1910 |accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early migrations===
{{Expand section|date=October 2017}}
[[File:Waldseemuller map 2.jpg|thumb|''Universalis Cosmographia'', the [[Waldseemüller map]] dated 1507, from a time when the nature of the Americas was ambiguous, particularly North America, as a possible part of Asia, was the first map to show the Americas separating two distinct oceans. South America was generally considered a "new world" and  shows the name "America" for the first time, after [[Amerigo Vespucci]]]]
[[File:Carta universal en que se contiene todo lo que del mundo se ha descubierto fasta agora hizola Diego Ribero cosmographo de su magestad, ano de 1529, en Sevilla.jpg|thumb|left|Made in 1529, the [[Diogo Ribeiro]] map was the first to show the Pacific at about its proper size]]
[[File:Ortelius - Maris Pacifici 1589.jpg|right|thumb|[[Maris Pacifici]] by [[Abraham Ortelius|Ortelius]] (1589). One of the first printed maps to show the Pacific Ocean&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2001/01-093.html |title=Library Acquires Copy of 1507 Waldseemüller World Map – News Releases (Library of Congress) |publisher=Loc.gov |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Important human migrations occurred in the Pacific in prehistoric times. About 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Austronesian peoples]] on the island of [[Taiwan]] mastered the art of long-distance canoe travel and spread themselves and their languages south to the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], and [[maritime Southeast Asia]]; west towards [[Madagascar]]; southeast towards [[New Guinea]] and [[Melanesia]] (intermarrying with native [[Papuan people|Papuans]]); and east to the islands of [[Micronesia]], [[Oceania]] and [[Polynesia]].&lt;ref name="Stanley2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=David|title=South Pacific|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDGapfBX-CAC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=13 June 2013|date=2004|publisher=David Stanley|isbn=978-1-56691-411-6|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-distance trade developed all along the coast from [[Mozambique]] to [[Japan]]. Trade, and therefore knowledge, extended to the Indonesian islands but apparently not Australia. By at least 878 when there was a significant Islamic settlement in [[Guangzhou|Canton]] much of this trade was controlled by Arabs or Muslims. In 219&amp;nbsp;BC [[Xu Fu]] sailed out into the Pacific searching for the elixir of immortality. From 1404 to 1433 [[Zheng He]] led [[Treasure voyages|expeditions into the Indian Ocean]].

===European exploration===

The first contact of European navigators with the western edge of the Pacific Ocean was made by the Portuguese expeditions of [[António de Abreu]] and [[Francisco Serrão]], via the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], to the [[Maluku Islands]], in 1512,&lt;ref&gt;Hannard (1991), page 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milton|first=Giles|authorlink=Giles Milton|title=Nathaniel's Nutmeg|publisher=Sceptre|date=1999|location=London|pages=5, 7|isbn=978-0-340-69676-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Jorge Álvares]]'s expedition to southern China in 1513,&lt;ref name="Porter, Jonathan 1996"&gt;Porter, Jonathan.

Westview Press.  {{ISBN|0-8133-3749-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; both ordered by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] from [[Malacca]].

The east side of the ocean was discovered by Spanish explorer [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] in 1513 after his expedition crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and reached a new ocean.&lt;ref name="Ober"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ober|first=Frederick Albion|title=Vasco Nuñez de Balboa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=98zUIbdvAYgC&amp;pg=PT129|accessdate=12 June 2013|publisher=Library of Alexandria|isbn=978-1-4655-7034-5|page=129|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He named it ''Mar del Sur'' (literally, "Sea of the South" or "South Sea") because the ocean was to the south of the coast of the isthmus where he first observed the Pacific.

[[File:SpanishPacific.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Spanish explorations and routes across the Pacific Ocean.]]

Later, Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] sailed the Pacific East to West on a Castilian (''Spanish'') expedition of world [[circumnavigation]] starting in 1519. Magellan called the ocean ''Pacífico'' (or "Pacific" meaning, "peaceful") because, after sailing through the stormy seas off [[Cape Horn]], the expedition found calm waters. The ocean was often called the ''Sea of Magellan'' in his honor until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Camino, Mercedes Maroto. ''Producing the Pacific: Maps and Narratives of Spanish Exploration (1567–1606)'', p.76. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Magellan himself died in the [[Philippines]] in 1521, Spanish Basque navigator [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] led the remains of the expedition back to Spain across the [[Indian Ocean]] and round the [[Cape of Good Hope]], completing the first world circumnavigation in a single expedition in 1522.&lt;ref name=oceanario&gt;[http://www.oceanario.pt/cms/1316/ "Life in the sea: Pacific Ocean"], Oceanário de Lisboa.

In 1564, five Spanish ships carrying 379 explorers crossed the ocean from Mexico led by [[Miguel López de Legazpi]], and sailed to the [[Philippines]] and [[Mariana Islands]].&lt;ref name="HendersonDelpar2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderson|first1=James D.|last2=Delpar|first2=Helen|last3=Brungardt|first3=Maurice Philip|author4=Weldon, Richard N. |title=A Reference Guide to Latin American History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2F7c0wW7g4C&amp;pg=PA28|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=January 2000|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-1-56324-744-6|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the remainder of the 16th century, Spanish influence was paramount, with ships sailing from [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]] across the Pacific Ocean to the Philippines via [[Guam]], and establishing the [[Spanish East Indies]]. The [[Manila galleon]]s operated for two and a half centuries, linking [[Manila]] and [[Acapulco]], in one of the longest trade routes in history. Spanish expeditions also discovered [[Tuvalu]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Cook Islands]], the [[Solomon Islands]], and the [[Admiralty Islands]] in the South Pacific.&lt;ref name="Fernandez-Armesto 2006 305–307"&gt;{{cite book |last= Fernandez-Armesto |first= Felipe |title= Pathfinders: A Global History of Exploration |date= 2006 |publisher= W.W.

Later, in the quest for [[Terra Australis]] ("the [great] Southern Land"), Spanish explorations in the 17th century, such as the expedition led by the Portuguese navigator [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], discovered the [[Pitcairn Islands|Pitcairn]] and [[Vanuatu]] archipelagos, and sailed the [[Torres Strait]] between [[Australia]] and New Guinea, named after navigator [[Luís Vaz de Torres]]. Dutch explorers, sailing around southern Africa, also engaged in discovery and trade; [[Willem Janszoon]], made the first completely documented European landing in Australia (1606), in [[Cape York Peninsula]],&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Sigmond and L.H. Zuiderbaan (1979) ''Dutch Discoveries of Australia''.Rigby Ltd, Australia. pp. 19–30 {{ISBN|0-7270-0800-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abel Tasman|Abel Janszoon Tasman]] circumnavigated and landed on parts of the [[Australia]]n continental coast and discovered [[Tasmania]] and [[New Zealand]] in 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Primary Australian History: Book F [B6] Ages 10–11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_i98Pu5dDhkC&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=2008|publisher=R.I.C.

In the 16th and 17th centuries Spain considered the Pacific Ocean a ''[[mare clausum]]''—a sea closed to other naval powers. As the only known entrance from the Atlantic, the [[Strait of Magellan]] was at times patrolled by fleets sent to prevent entrance of non-Spanish ships. On the western side of the Pacific Ocean the Dutch threatened the  [[the Philippines|Spanish Philippines]].&lt;ref name=lytle&gt;{{Citation

The 18th century marked the beginning of major exploration by the Russians in [[Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands]], such as the [[First Kamchatka expedition]] and the [[Great Northern Expedition]], led by the Danish Russian navy officer [[Vitus Bering]]. Spain also sent [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|expeditions to the Pacific Northwest]], reaching [[Vancouver Island]] in southern Canada, and Alaska. The French explored and settled [[Polynesia]], and the British made three voyages with [[James Cook]] to the South Pacific and [[Australia]], [[Hawaii]], and the North American [[Pacific Northwest]]. In 1768, [[Pierre-Antoine Véron]], a young [[astronomer]] accompanying [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] on his voyage of exploration, established the width of the Pacific with precision for the first time in history.&lt;ref name="Williams2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Glyndwr|title=Captain Cook: Explorations And Reassessments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqDHGru-zcIC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=2004|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=978-1-84383-100-6|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest voyages of scientific exploration was organized by Spain in the [[Malaspina Expedition]] of 1789–1794. It sailed vast areas of the Pacific, from Cape Horn to Alaska, Guam and the Philippines, New Zealand, Australia, and the South Pacific.&lt;ref name="Fernandez-Armesto 2006 305–307"/&gt;

The Pacific separates [[Asia]] and [[Australia]] from the [[Americas]]. It may be further subdivided by the equator into northern (North Pacific) and southern (South Pacific) portions. It extends from the [[Antarctic]] region in the South to the [[Arctic]] in the north.&lt;ref name=ebc/&gt; The Pacific Ocean encompasses approximately one-third of the [[Earth]]'s surface, having an area of {{convert|165,200,000|km2|abbr=on}}—significantly larger than Earth's entire landmass of some {{convert|150,000,000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/DanielChen.shtml "Area of Earth's Land Surface"], ''The Physics Factbook''.

Islands in the Pacific Ocean are of four basic types: continental islands, high islands, coral reefs and uplifted coral platforms. Continental islands lie outside the andesite line and include New Guinea, the islands of New Zealand, and the [[Philippines]]. Some of these islands are structurally associated with nearby continents. High islands are of volcanic origin, and many contain active volcanoes. Among these are [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], Hawaii, and the Solomon Islands.&lt;ref name="GillespieClague2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gillespie|first1=Rosemary G.|last2=Clague|first2=David A.|title=Encyclopedia of Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g9ZogGs_fz8C&amp;pg=PA706|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=2009|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25649-1|page=706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[coral reef]]s of the South Pacific are low-lying structures that have built up on basaltic lava flows under the ocean's surface. One of the most dramatic is the [[Great Barrier Reef]] off northeastern [[Australia]] with chains of reef patches. A second island type formed of coral is the uplifted coral platform, which is usually slightly larger than the low coral islands. Examples include [[Banaba Island|Banaba]] (formerly Ocean Island) and [[Makatea]] in the Tuamotu group of [[French Polynesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/137072/coral-island "Coral island"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.

The ocean was first mapped by [[Abraham Ortelius]]; he called it Maris Pacifici following [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s description of it as "a pacific sea" during his circumnavigation from 1519 to 1522. To Magellan, it seemed much more calm (pacific) than the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="Library2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Turnbull, Alexander |title=Map New Zealand: 100 Magnificent Maps from the Collection of the Alexander Turnbull Library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=227gAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 June 2013|date=15 December 2006|publisher=Godwit|isbn=978-1-86962-126-1|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[andesite line]] is the most significant regional distinction in the Pacific. A petrologic boundary, it separates the deeper, [[mafic]] [[igneous rock]] of the Central Pacific Basin from the partially submerged continental areas of [[felsic]] igneous rock on its margins.&lt;ref name="TrentHazlett2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trent|first1=D.

The dissimilarity continues northeastward along the western edge of the [[Andes]] [[American Cordillera|Cordillera]] along [[South America]] to [[Mexico]], returning then to the islands off California. [[Indonesia]], the Philippines, Japan, New Guinea, and New Zealand lie outside the andesite line.

Within the closed loop of the andesite line are most of the deep troughs, submerged volcanic mountains, and oceanic volcanic islands that characterize the Pacific basin. Here basaltic lavas gently flow out of rifts to build huge dome-shaped volcanic mountains whose eroded summits form island arcs, chains, and clusters. Outside the andesite line, volcanism is of the explosive type, and the Pacific [[Ring of Fire]] is the world's foremost belt of explosive [[volcanism]].&lt;ref name="AAE"/&gt; The Ring of Fire is named after the several hundred active volcanoes that sit above the various subduction zones.

The Pacific Ocean is the only ocean which is almost totally bounded by [[subduction]] zones. Only the Antarctic and Australian coasts have no nearby subduction zones.

===Geological history===
The Pacific Ocean was born 750 million years ago at the breakup of [[Rodinia]], although it is generally called the Panthalassic Ocean until the breakup of  [[Pangea]], about 200 million years ago.&lt;ref name="geol.umd.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geol.umd.edu/~tholtz/G102/102prot2.htm |title=GEOL 102 The Proterozoic Eon II: Rodinia and Pannotia |publisher=Geol.umd.edu |date=5 January 2010 |accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Pacific Ocean floor is only around 180 [[Mega-annum|Ma]] old, with older crust subducted by now.&lt;ref name="MussettKhan2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mussett|first1=Alan E.|last2=Khan|first2=M.

===Seamount chains===
The Pacific Ocean contains several long [[seamount]] chains, formed by [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot volcanism]]. These include the [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain]] and the [[Louisville Ridge]].

==Economy==
The exploitation of the Pacific's mineral wealth is hampered by the ocean's great depths. In shallow waters of the continental shelves off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand, [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] are extracted, and [[pearl]]s are harvested along the coasts of [[Australia]], [[Japan]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], and the [[Philippines]], although in sharply declining volume in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/437703/Pacific-Ocean/36099/Fisheries "Pacific Ocean: Fisheries"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 12 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fishing===
[[Fish]] are an important economic asset in the Pacific. The shallower shoreline waters of the continents and the more temperate islands yield [[herring]], [[salmon]], [[sardine]]s, [[Australasian snapper|snapper]], [[swordfish]], and [[tuna]], as well as [[shellfish]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/world/pacific-ocean-commerce-shipping.html "Pacific Ocean: Commerce and Shipping"], ''The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia'', 6th edition. Retrieved 14 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Overfishing]] has become a serious problem in some areas. For example, catches in the rich fishing grounds of the [[Sea of Okhotsk|Okhotsk Sea]] off the Russian coast have been reduced by at least half since the 1990s as a result of overfishing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://centerforoceansolutions.org/?q=projects/pacific-ocean-initiative/major-threats-pacific-ocean/overfishing-and-exploitation "Pacific Ocean Threats &amp; Impacts: Overfishing and Exploitation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512140621/http://www.centerforoceansolutions.org/?q=projects%2Fpacific-ocean-initiative%2Fmajor-threats-pacific-ocean%2Foverfishing-and-exploitation |date=12 May 2013 }}, Center for Ocean Solutions.

[[File:Marine debris on Hawaiian coast.jpg|thumb|[[Marine debris]] on a [[Hawaii]]an coast]]
The quantity of small plastic fragments floating in the north-east Pacific Ocean increased a hundredfold between 1972 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18099937 Plastic waste in the North Pacific is an ongoing concern] BBC 9 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine pollution is a generic term for the harmful entry into the ocean of chemicals or particles. The main culprits are those using the rivers for disposing of their waste.&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/09/photogalleries/pacific-garbage-patch-pictures/ |title=PHOTOS: Giant Ocean-Trash Vortex Documented-A First |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rivers then empty into the ocean, often also bringing chemicals used as [[fertilizer]]s in agriculture. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water leads to [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] and the creation of a [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerlach: Marine Pollution, Springer, Berlin (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marine debris]], also known as marine litter, is human-created waste that has ended up floating in a lake, sea, ocean, or waterway. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;

In addition, the Pacific Ocean has served as the crash site of satellites, including [[Mars 96]], [[Fobos-Grunt]], and [[Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3513">A '''pediment''' is a very gently sloping (.5°-7°) inclined [[bedrock]] surface.&lt;ref name = EB&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/448534/pediment Encyclopædia Britannica, Pediment]&lt;/ref&gt; It typically slopes down from the base of a steeper [[Cliff retreat|retreating desert cliff]], or [[escarpment]],&lt;ref name = EG&gt;Essentials of Geology, 3rd Edition, Stephen Marshak, p464, pG-15&lt;/ref&gt; but may continue to exist after the mountain has eroded away.&lt;ref name = EB/&gt; It is caused by [[erosion]].&lt;ref name = EG/&gt; It develops when sheets of running water ([[laminar sheet flows]]) wash over it in intense rainfall events.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; It may be thinly covered with [[fluvial]] gravel that has washed over it from the foot of mountains produced by [[cliff retreat]] erosion. It is typically a concave surface gently sloping away from mountainous desert areas.&lt;ref name=Easterbrook&gt;Easterbrook, Don J. (1999) ''Surface Processes and Landforms'', New Jersey, Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not to be confused with merged groups of alluvial fans ([[Bajada (geography)|bajadas]]), which also may appear to gently slope from an escarpment, but are composed of material eroded from canyons, not bedrock.&lt;ref name = EB /&gt;

Three formational zones are recognized for pediments:&lt;ref name=Easterbrook/&gt;
* An inner most zone of mountainous uplands that have near vertical erosion
* An intermediate zone or degradation zone which is the pediment beyond the mountain front.
* An outer zone or aggradation zone which extends beyond the pediment and is a zone of deposition.

Coalescence of pediments over a large area results in a [[pediplain]].&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Jones|first=David K.C.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Denudation chronology|year=2004|pages=244–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*  Rillwash or [[rill]] erosion-&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History ==
In 1877 [[Grove Karl Gilbert]] first observed pediments in the [[Henry Mountains]] in [[Utah]]. He described the formation as "hills of {{Not a typo|planation}} cut across the upturned edges of tilted beds". Gilbert believed the origin of pediments in the Henry Mountains are due to stream {{Not a typo|planation}} and active erosion of deserts. This theory was advocated by Paige (1912), Blackwelder (1931), and Johnson 1932. Johnson came up with three zones of pediments.&lt;ref name=Easterbrook/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4228">'''QDGC''' - Quarter Degree Grid Cells (or QDS - Quarter degree Squares) are a way of dividing the [[longitude]] [[latitude]] degree square cells into smaller squares, forming in effect a system of [[geocode]]s. Historically QDGC has been used in a lot of African atlases. Several African biodiversity projects uses QDGC, among which The atlas of Southern African Birds&lt;ref&gt;HARRISON, J.A., ALLAN, D.G., UNDERHILL, L.G., HERREMANS, M., TREE, A.J., PARKER, V. &amp; BROWN, C.J. (1997) ''The atlas of southern African birds. Vols 1 and 2'', BirdLife South Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; is the most prominent one. In 2009 a paper by Larsen ''et al.'' &lt;ref&gt;R. Larsen, T. Holmern, S. D. Prager, H. Maliti and E. Røskaft (2009) ''Using the extended quarter degree grid cell system to unify mapping and sharing of biodiversity data'', African Journal of Ecology. Volume 47, Issue 3 , Pages382 - 392&lt;/ref&gt; describes the QDGC standard in detail.

== Mechanics ==
The squares themselves are based on the degree squares covering earth. QDGC represents a way of making approximately equal area squares covering a specific area to represent specific qualities of the area covered. However, differences in area between 'squares' enlarge along with longitudinal distance and this can violate assumptions of many statistical analyses requiring truly equal-area grids. For instance species range modelling or estimates of ecological niche could be substantilly affected if data were not appriopriatelly transformed, e.g. projected onto a plane using a special projection.&lt;ref&gt;Elith, J., Phillips, S. J., Hastie, T., Dudík, M., Chee, Y. E., &amp; Yates, C. J. (2011). A statistical explanation of MaxEnt for ecologists. Diversity and distributions, 17(1), 43-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the equator we have 360 longitudinal lines, and from the north to the south pole we have 180 latitudinal lines. Together this gives us 64800 segments or tiles covering earth. The form of the squares becomes more rectangular the longer north we come. At the poles they are not square or even rectangular at all, but end up in elongated triangles.

Each degree square is designated by a full reference to the main degree square. S01E010 is a reference to a square in Tanzania. '''S''' means the square is south of equator, and '''E''' means it is East of the zero meridian. The numbers refer to longitudinal and latitudinal degree.

A square with no sublevel reference is also called QDGC level 0. This is square based on a full degree longitude by a full degree latitude. The QDGC level 0 squares are themselves divided into four.

{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center"
| A
| B
|- 
| C
| D
|-
|}

To get smaller squares the above squares are again divided in four - giving us a total of 16 squares within a degree square. The names for the new level of squares are named the same way. The full reference of a square could then be:

*S01E010AD

The number of squares for each QDGC level can be calculated with this formula:

number of squares = (2&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

(where ''d'' is QDGC level)

{{About|the concept of region in geography}} 
In [[geography]], '''regions''' are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics ([[physical geography]]), human impact characteristics ([[human geography]]), and the interaction of humanity and the environment ([[environmental geography]]). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where [[Jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] areas such as national borders are defined in law.

Apart from the [[Earth|global]] [[continent]]al regions, there are also [[hydrosphere|hydrospheric]] and [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] regions that cover the [[ocean]]s, and discrete [[climate]]s above the land and water masses of the planet. The land and water global regions are divided into subregions geographically bounded by large geological features that influence large-scale ecologies, such as [[plain]]s and features.

As a way of describing spatial areas, the concept of regions is important and widely used among the many branches of geography, each of which can describe areas in regional terms.  For example, ecoregion is a term used in [[environmental geography]], cultural region in [[cultural geography]], bioregion in [[biogeography]], and so on.  The field of geography that studies regions themselves is called [[regional geography]].

In the fields of [[physical geography]], [[ecology]], [[biogeography]], [[zoogeography]], and [[environmental geography]], regions tend to be based on natural features such as [[ecosystem]]s or [[biotope]]s, [[biome]]s, [[drainage basin]]s, [[natural region]]s, [[mountain range]]s, [[soil type]]s. Where [[human geography]] is concerned, the regions and subregions are described by the discipline of [[ethnography]].

A region has its own nature that could not be moved. The first nature is its natural environment (landform, climate, etc.). The second nature is its physical elements complex that were built by people in the past. The third nature is its socio-cultural context that could not be replaced by new immigrants.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Globalization==
[[File:Map of the world by the US Gov as of 2016.svg|frameless|upright=1.8|right|Map of the [[Earth]]]]
Global regions  distinguishable from space, and are therefore clearly distinguished by the two basic terrestrial environments, land and [[water]]. However, they have been generally recognised as such much earlier by terrestrial [[cartography]] because of their impact on human geography. They are divided into largest of land regions, known as [[continent]]s, and the largest of water regions known as [[ocean]]s. There are also significant regions that do not belong to either classification, such as [[archipelago]] regions that are [[littoral]] regions, or [[earthquake]] regions that are defined in [[geology]].

===Continental regions===
Continental regions are usually based on broad experiences in human history and attempts to reduce very large areas to more manageable [[regionalization]] for the purpose of study. As such they are conceptual constructs, usually lacking distinct boundaries. Oceanic division into maritime regions are used in conjunction with the relationship to the central area of the continent, using directions of the [[compass]].

Some continental regions are defined by the major continental feature of their identity, such as the [[Amazon basin]], or the [[Sahara]], which both occupy a significant percentage of their respective continental land area.

To a large extent, major continental regions are mental constructs created by considering an efficient way to define large areas of the continents. For the most part, the images of the world are derived as much from academic studies, the media{{Clarify|date=December 2015}}, or from personal experience of global [[exploration]]. They are a matter of collective human knowledge of its own planet and are attempts to better understand their environments.

===Regional geography===
[[Regional geography]] is a branch of geography that studies regions of all sizes across the [[Earth]]. It has a prevailing descriptive character. The main aim is to understand or define the uniqueness or character of a particular region, which consists of natural as well as human elements. Attention is paid also to regionalization, which covers the proper techniques of space [[delimitation]] into regions.

Regional geography is also considered as a certain approach to study in geographical sciences (similar to [[quantitative revolution|quantitative]] or [[critical geography|critical geographies]]; for more information, see [[history of geography]]).

==Human geography==
[[Human geography]] is a branch of geography that focuses on the study of patterns and processes that shape human interaction with various discrete environments. It encompasses [[human]], [[politics|political]], [[culture|cultural]], [[social issues|social]], and [[economics|economic]] aspects among others that are often clearly delineated. While the major focus of human geography is not the physical landscape of the Earth (see [[physical geography]]), it is hardly possible to discuss human geography without referring to the physical landscape on which human activities are being played out, and [[environmental geography]] is emerging as a link between the two. Regions of human geography can be divided into many broad categories:
*[[Cultural geography]]
*[[Demography]]
*[[Development geography]]
*[[Economic geography]]
*[[Ethnography]]
*[[Geopolitics]]
*[[Health geography]]
*[[Historical geography]]
*[[Language geography]]
*[[Religion geography]]
*[[Social geography]]
*[[Time geography]]
*[[Tourism geography]]
*[[Transportation geography]]
*[[Urban geography]]
*[[Media Geography]]

===Historical regions===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hispanic]] --&gt;
{{main|Historical region}}
The field of [[historical geography]] involves the study of human history as it relates to places and [[Historical region|regions]] or the study of how places and regions have changed over time.

[[D. W. Meinig]], a historical geographer of America, describes many historical regions in his book ''The Shaping of America: A Geographical Perspective on 500 Years of History''.  For example, in identifying European "source regions" in early American colonization efforts, he defines and describes the ''Northwest European Atlantic Protestant Region'', which includes sub-regions such as the "Western Channel Community", which itself is made of sub-regions such as the ''English [[West Country]]'' of [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], [[Somerset]], and [[Dorset]].

In describing historic regions of America, Meinig writes of "The Great Fishery" off the coast of Newfoundland and New England, an oceanic region that includes the [[Grand Banks]]. He rejects regions traditionally used in describing American history, like [[New France]], "West Indies", the [[Middle Colonies]], and the individual colonies themselves ([[Province of Maryland]], for example).  Instead he writes of "discrete colonization areas," which may be named after colonies but rarely adhere strictly to political boundaries. Historic regions of this type Meinig writes about include "Greater New England" and its major sub-regions of "Plymouth," "New Haven shores" (including parts of Long Island), "Rhode Island" (or "Narragansett Bay"), "the Piscataqua," "Massachusetts Bay," "Connecticut Valley," and to a lesser degree, regions in the sphere of influence of Greater New England, "Acadia" (Nova Scotia), "Newfoundland and The Fishery/The Banks."

Other examples of historical regions include Iroquoia, [[Ohio Country]], [[Illinois Country]], and [[Rupert's Land]].

=== Tourism region ===
{{Main article|Tourism region}}
A tourism region is a geographical region that has been designated by a governmental organization or [[tourism bureau]] as having common cultural or environmental characteristics. These regions are often named after a geographical, former, or current administrative region or may have a name created for [[tourism]] purposes. The names often evoke certain positive qualities of the area and suggest a coherent tourism experience to visitors. Countries, states, provinces, and other administrative regions are often carved up into tourism regions to facilitate attracting visitors.

Some of the more famous tourism regions based on historical or current administrative regions include [[Tuscany]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turismo.intoscana.it/intoscana2/export/TurismoRTen Turismo.intoscana.it]. Retrieved 2009-11-25&lt;/ref&gt; in Italy and [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitmexico.com/wb/Visitmexico/Visi_Yucatan Visitmexico.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102031607/http://visitmexico.com/wb/Visitmexico/Visi_Yucatan |date=2010-01-02 }}, Retrieved 2009-11-25&lt;/ref&gt; in Mexico. Famous examples of regions created by a government or tourism bureau include the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Lake District]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk Lakedistrict.gov.uk], Retrieved 2009-11-25&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wine Country (California)|California's Wine Country]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winecountry.com Winecountry.com], Retrieved 2009-11-25&lt;/ref&gt;
great plains region

===Natural resource regions===
[[Natural resource]]s often occur in distinct regions.  Natural resource regions can be a topic of physical geography or environmental geography, but also have a strong element of human geography and economic geography.  A coal region, for example, is a physical or geomorphological region, but its development and exploitation can make it into an economic and a cultural region.  Some examples of natural resource regions include the [[Rumaila Field]], the oil field that lies along the border or Iraq and Kuwait and played a role in the [[Gulf War]]; the [[Coal Region]] of Pennsylvania, which is a historical region as well as a cultural, physical, and natural resource region; the [[South Wales Coalfield]], which like Pennsylvania's coal region is a historical, cultural, and natural region; the [[Kuznetsk Basin]], a similarly important coal mining region in Russia; [[Kryvbas]], the economic and iron ore mining region of Ukraine; and the [[James Bay Project]], a large region of Quebec where one of the largest hydroelectric systems in the world has been developed.

===Religious regions===
Sometimes a region associated with a religion is given a name, like [[Christendom]], a term with medieval and renaissance connotations of Christianity as a sort of social and political [[Body Politic|polity]].  The term [[Muslim world]] is sometimes used to refer to the region of the world where Islam is dominant.  These broad terms are very vague when used to describe regions.

Within some religions there are clearly defined regions.  The [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[List of Church of England dioceses|Church of England]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and others, define ecclesiastical regions with names such as [[diocese]], [[eparchy]], [[Ecclesiastical Province|ecclesiastical provinces]], and [[parish]].

For example, the United States is divided into 32 Roman Catholic [[List of the Roman Catholic dioceses of the United States|ecclesiastical provinces]].  The [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] is organized into 33 geographic ''districts'', which are subdivided into ''circuits'' (the [[Atlantic District (LCMS)]], for example).  [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] uses regions similar to dioceses and parishes, but uses terms like [[Ward (LDS Church)|ward]] and [[Stake (Mormonism)|stake]].

{{anchor|Political regions}}

===Political regions===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Regions of Italy]] --&gt;
{{see also|Administrative divisions}}
In the field of [[political geography]], regions tend to be based on political units such as [[sovereign state]]s; subnational units such as administrative regions,  [[province]]s, [[U.S. state|states (in the United States)]], [[county|counties]], [[township]]s, [[Territory (country subdivision)|territories]], etc.; and multinational groupings, including formally defined units such as the [[European Union]], the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]], and [[NATO]], as well as informally defined regions such as the [[Third World]], [[Western Europe]], and the Middle East.

===Administrative regions===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Montoire-sur-le-Loir]] --&gt;
{{further|Administrative division}}
The word "region" is taken from the [[Latin]] ''regio'' (derived from ''regere'', to rule), and a number of countries have borrowed the term as the formal name for a type of subnational entity (e.g., the [[Regions of Chile|''región'']], used in [[Chile]]). In English, the word is also used as the conventional translation for equivalent terms in other languages (e.g., the [[Oblasts of Russia|''область'']] (''[[oblast]]''), used in Russia alongside a broader term ''регион'').

The following countries use the term "region" (or its [[cognate]]) as the name of a type of subnational administrative unit:
*[[Regions of Belgium|Belgium]] (in French, ''région''; in German, ''Region''; the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] term ''gewest'' is often translated as "region")
*[[Regions of Chad|Chad]] (''{{lang|fr|région}}'', effective from 2002)
*[[Regions of Chile|Chile]] (''región'')
*[[Regions of Côte d'Ivoire|Côte d'Ivoire]] (''région'')
*[[Regions of Denmark|Denmark]] (effective from 2007)
*[[Regions of England|England]] (not the United Kingdom as a whole)
*[[Regions of Eritrea|Eritrea]]
*[[Regions of France|France]] (''région'')
*[[Regions of Ghana|Ghana]]
*[[Regions of Guinea|Guinea]] (''région'')
*[[Regions of Guinea-Bissau|Guinea-Bissau]] (''região'')
*[[Regions of Guyana|Guyana]]
*[[Regions of Hungary|Hungary]] (''régió'')
*[[Regions of Italy|Italy]] (''regione'')
*[[Regions of Madagascar|Madagascar]] (''région'')
*[[Regions of Mali|Mali]] (''région'')
*[[Regions of Malta|Malta]] (''reġjun'')
*[[Regions of Namibia|Namibia]]
*[[Regions of New Zealand|New Zealand]]
*[[Regions of Peru|Peru]] (''región'')
*[[List of regions and sub-regions of Portugal|Portugal]] (''região'')
*[[Regions of the Philippines|Philippines]] (''rehiyon'')
*[[Regions of Senegal|Senegal]] (''région'')
*[[Regions of Tanzania|Tanzania]]
*[[Regions of Togo|Togo]] (''région'')
*[[Regional Corporations and Municipalities of Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad and Tobago]] (''Regional Corporation'')
The Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[List of Quebec regions|Québec]] also uses the "administrative region" (''région administrative'').

Scotland had [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|local government regions]] from 1975 to 1996.

In Spain the official name of the [[autonomous community]] of [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] is ''Región de Murcia''. Also, some single-province autonomous communities such as [[Madrid]] use the term ''región'' interchangeably with ''comunidad autónoma''.

Two [[Län of Sweden|län]] (counties) in Sweden are officially called 'regions': [[Skåne]] and [[Västra Götaland]], and there is currently a controversial proposal to divide the rest of Sweden into large [[Regions of Sweden|regions]], replacing the current counties.

The government of the [[Regions of the Philippines|Philippines]] uses the term "region" (in [[Filipino language|Filipino]], ''rehiyon'') when it's necessary to group provinces, the primary administrative subdivision of the country. This is also the case in [[Brazil]], which groups its primary administrative divisions (''estados''; "states") into ''grandes regiões'' ([[Regions of Brazil|greater regions]]) for statistical purposes, while Russia uses ''экономические районы'' ([[Economic regions of Russia|economic regions]]) in a similar way, as does [[Development regions of Romania|Romania]] and [[Administrative regions of Venezuela|Venezuela]].

The [[government of Singapore]] makes use of the term "[[Regions of Singapore|region]]" for its own administrative purposes.

The following countries use an administrative subdivision conventionally referred to as a region in English:
*[[Oblasts of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], which uses the ''област'' (''oblast'')
*[[Oblasts of Russia|Russia]], which uses the ''область'' (''oblast'''), and for some regions the [[Krais of Russia|''край'']] (''[[krai]]'')
*[[Subdivisions of Ukraine|Ukraine]], which uses the ''область'' (''oblast''')
*[[Regions of Slovakia|Slovakia]] (''kraj'')

China has five 自治区 (''zìzhìqū'') and two 特別行政區 (or 特别行政区; ''tèbiéxíngzhèngqū''), which are translated as "[[autonomous region of China|autonomous region]]" and "[[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]]", respectively.

====Local administrative regions====
There are many relatively small regions based on local government agencies such as districts, agencies, or regions. In general, they are all regions in the general sense of being bounded spatial units.  Examples include electoral districts such as [[Washington's 6th congressional district]] and [[Tennessee's 1st congressional district]]; school districts such as [[Granite School District]] and [[Los Angeles Unified School District]]; economic districts such as the [[Reedy Creek Improvement District]]; metropolitan areas such as the [[Seattle metropolitan area]], and metropolitan districts such as the [[Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago]], the [[Las Vegas-Clark County Library District]], the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] of [[Greater London]], as well as other local districts like the [[York Rural Sanitary District]], the [[Delaware River Port Authority]], the [[Nassau County Soil and Water Conservation District]], and [[C-TRAN (Washington)|C-TRAN]].

===Traditional or informal regions===
The traditional territorial divisions of some countries are also commonly rendered in English as "regions". These informal divisions do not form the basis of the modern administrative divisions of these countries, but still define and delimit local regional identity and sense of belonging. Examples include:

* [[Regions of Finland|Finland]]
* [[Regions of Japan|Japan]]
* [[Regions of Korea|Korea]]
* [[Regions of Norway|Norway]] (''landsdeler'')
* [[Historical regions of Romania|Romania]]
* [[List of traditional regions of Slovakia|Slovakia]]

===Functional regions===
Functional regions are usually understood to be the areas organised by the horizontal functional relations (flows, interactions) that are maximised within a region and minimised across its borders so that the principles of internal cohesiveness and external separation regarding spatial interactions are met (see, for instance, Farmer and Fotheringham, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farmer|first1=CJQ|last2=Fotheringham|first2=AS|title=Network-based functional regions|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=2011|volume=43|issue=11|pages=2723–2741|doi=10.1068/a44136}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Klapka, Halas, 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klapka|first=P|last2=Halas|first2=M|date=2016|title=Conceptualising patterns of spatial flows: five decades of advances in the definition and use of functional regions|url=|journal=Moravian Geographical Reports|volume=24|issue=2|pages=2–11|doi=10.1515/mgr-2016-0006|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Smart, 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smart|first1=MW|title=Labour market areas: uses and definition|journal=Progress in Planning|date=1974|volume=2|pages=239–353|doi=10.1016/0305-9006(74)90008-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A functional region is not an abstract spatial concept, but to a certain extent it can be regarded as a reflection of the spatial behaviour of individuals in a geographic space. 
The functional region is conceived as a general concept while its inner structure, inner spatial flows, and interactions need not necessarily show any regular pattern, only selfcontainment. The concept of self-containment remains the only crucial defining characteristic of a functional region. Nodal regions, functional urban regions, daily urban systems, local labour-market areas (LLMAs), or travel-to-work areas (TTWAs) are considered to be special instances of a general functional region that need to fulfil some specific conditions regarding, for instance, the character of the region-organising interaction or the presence of urban cores, (Halas et al., 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halas|first1=M|last2=Klapka|first2=P|last3=Tonev|first3=P|last4=Bednar|first4=M|title=An alternative definition and use for the constraint function for rule-based methods of functional regionalisation|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=2015|volume=47|issue=5|pages=1175–1191|doi=10.1177/0308518X15592306}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Military regions===
{{see also|Military district}}
{{Chain of Command}}
In military usage, a region is shorthand for the name of a military [[Military organization#Commands, formations, and units|formation]] larger than an [[Army group|Army Group]] and smaller than an [[Theater (warfare)|Army Theater]] or simply Theater. The full name of the military formation is Army Region. The size of an Army Region can vary widely but is generally somewhere between about 1 million and 3 million soldiers. Two or more Army Regions could make up an Army Theater. An Army Region is typically commanded by a full [[General]] (US four stars), a [[Field Marshal]], or [[General of the Army]] (US five stars), or [[Generalissimo]] (Soviet Union). Due to the large size of this formation, its use is rarely employed. Some of the very few examples of an Army Region are each of the Eastern, Western, and southern (mostly in Italy) fronts in Europe during [[World War II]]. The military map unit symbol for this echelon of formation (see [[Military organization]] and [[APP-6A]]) consists of six Xs.

===Media geography===
Media geography is a spatio-temporal understanding, brought through different gadgets of media, nowadays, media became inevitable at different proportions and everyone supposed to consumed at different gravity. The spatial attributes are studied with the help of media outputs in shape of images which are contested in nature and pattern as well where politics is inseparable. Media geography is giving spatial understanding of mediated image.

'''Richard Horwood''' (1757/8–1803)&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101052774/ Richard Horwood], [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]].
&lt;/ref&gt; was a surveyor and cartographer. Between 1792 and 1799 he published a ''Plan of the Cities of [[London]] and [[Westminster]] the Borough of [[Southwark]] and Parts adjoining Shewing every House''. At the time this was the largest map ever printed in Britain. After he decided to chart the entire city of London, down to each individual building, Horwood set about soliciting subscriptions to finance the project in 1790. His intention was to publish the complete map within two years, at a scale of 26 inches to the mile. However, the scope of the project was so extensive, and his cost to complete it so high, that rather than taking the estimated two years, the project took almost ten to complete. Despite acquiring royal patronage from King George III, the project suffered financial hardship, making it even more difficult to produce. However, Horwood eventually published the entire map, consisting of 32 sheets (four rows of eight columns). The last sheet was made available in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tames. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GoAxld48HM8C&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=richard+horwood+cartographer&amp;source=web&amp;ots=iEdAUj2xJx&amp;sig=sSIog5oNSa0dzjyS_idrI2W-xGs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result#PPA86,M1 ''London: A Cultural History.'']  [[Oxford University Press]], 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-19-530953-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1800 he wrote of the map, in a letter to the [[Royal Society of Arts|Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacture and Commerce]]:&lt;ref name="Horwood-RSA"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Horwood|first=Richard |title= Letter |year=1803 |journal=Transactions of the Society Instituted at London for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce |publisher=C. Spilsbury for the Society |location=London |volume=21 |pages=311–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RL-RH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romanticlondon.org/richard-horwood/|title=Richard Horwood (c.1758-1803)|work=Romantic London|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The execution of it has cost me nine years severe labour and indefatigable perseverance; and these years formed the most valuable part of my life.  I took every angle; measured almost every line; and after that, plotted and compared the whole work.  The engraving, considering the immense mass of work, is, I flatter myself, well done.}}

Horwood also published a map of [[Liverpool]], the city where he died impoverished in 1803, not long after completing his extensive project.

==Modern usage==
Sections of an 1813 edition of the London map are reproduced in [[Charles Palliser]]'s novel ''[[The Quincunx]]''. The story is set a few years after the publication of the map, which is used by one of the characters.

A selection of the Horwood maps were used in the publication of [[Timbuctoo (novel)|''Timbuctoo'']], a novel based on the adventures of [[Robert Adams (sailor)|Robert Adams]], which includes five large fold-out maps of London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3922">A '''route card''' is a document that is used by [[hillwalker]]s as an aid to [[navigation]] and route planning.  The military also use a similar technique for planning night marches and/or [[patrol]]s.

== Core information: The planned route ==

The planned route is broken down into discrete sections termed "legs" or "stages".   Whenever possible, each leg will start and finish at a clearly defined topographical feature such as a [[lake]], [[Hillock|knoll]], saddle, [[stream]] junction and so on.  In most cases the legs are defined as being the longest section that might be safely followed on a single [[compass]] bearing.  The object is to split the overall route into sections that can be readily undertaken in conditions of poor visibility such as in [[cloud]], [[fog]] or at night.

In addition to the compass bearing, for each leg the total distance will be measured as well as the height gained or lost and the steepness of the ground. Using this information an estimated time to complete the leg will be calculated usually using [[Naismith's Rule]] or one of its variations.  These times are then added to estimate the total time needed for the expedition.

For each leg note may also be taken of potential sources of danger along the route such as [[cliff]]s or of handrail/collecting features to aid in confirming the route.

== Additional information ==

For formal expeditions or excursions the leader may include the following information.

*composition of the party with the names of the members, car registration numbers.
*actual start time and date.
*estimated time and date of arrival at finish.
*mobile [[telephone]] number and/or [[radio]] frequencies in use
*notes regarding special equipment carried, [[tent]]s, emergency shelters, food etc.

A copy of the route card is then left with a responsible person so as to assist the emergency services in the event that the group should suffer a mishap.  This also avoids groups being reported as missing prematurely or without due cause.

== Use of route cards ==

In typical use, the route card will not be followed exactly by the party leader but is used as a backup if conditions deteriorate.  When following legs on a compass bearing, the estimated time is not usually used as a precise indicator of when the leg is over but as a kind of fail-safe to stop the group from overshooting the actual objective and getting lost.  If a precise estimate is needed, pace-counting may be used instead if terrain permits.  Nowadays, it is typical to enter the co-ordinates from the route card into a handheld [[GPS]] unit and use this in conjunction with a compass if conditions deteriorate.  In some cases, each member of the expedition may memorize a section of the route and have their own compass preset to the relevant bearing.  This is a particular technique for military night patrols where the [[soldier]]s each lead a section of the route.

== Use of Moon route cards ==

Military use these to assist a planned route for night navigation same as a route card.

It is very simply a route card just showing the legs or stages of the route. Some commanders have a full detailed route card as well as the moon route card when doing night navigation. 

The two reasons for this is that you can pull the Moon card out on the march and hold it up to the moon light to check the bearing or grid reference of the next leg, and to stop you getting out your torch and giving your position away.

[[File:Far Eastern in Russia.svg|right|300px|thumb| [[Far Eastern Federal District]] (highlighted)]]

The '''Russian Far East''' ({{lang-rus|Дальний Восток России|r=Dal'niy Vostok Rossii|p=ˈdalʲnʲɪj vɐˈstok rɐˈsʲiɪ}}, literally “The distant East of Russia) comprises the Russian part of the [[Far East]] - the extreme eastern territory of [[Russia]], between [[Lake Baikal]] in Eastern [[Siberia]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The [[Far Eastern Federal District]], which covers this area, borders with the [[Siberian Federal District]] to the west. The Far Eastern Federal District has land borders with the [[People's Republic of China]] and with the [[Democratic People’s Republic of Korea]] to the south west. It has maritime borders with [[Japan]] and with the [[United States]]. Although traditionally considered{{by whom|date=March 2018}} part of [[Siberia]], the Russian Far East is categorized separately from Siberia in Russian regional schemes (and previously during the [[USSR|Soviet]] era when it was called the '''Soviet Far East''').

==Terminology==

===In Russia===
In Russia, the region is usually referred to as just "Far East" ({{lang|ru|Дальний Восток}}). What is known in English as the [[Far East]] is usually referred to as "the [[Asia-Pacific|Asia-Pacific Region]]" ({{lang|ru|Азиатско-тихоокеанский регион}}, abbreviated to {{lang|ru|АТР}}), or "[[East Asia]]" ({{lang|ru|Восточная Азия}}).

==History==

===Russian exploration===
[[File:Vladivostok in the 1900s 05.jpg|thumb|[[Vladivostok]] in the early 1900s]]
{{Further|Russian conquest of Siberia}}
{{Further|Outer Manchuria}}

Russia reached the Pacific coast in 1647 with the establishment of [[Okhotsk]], and consolidated its control over the Russian Far East in the 19th century, after [[annexation]] part of Chinese [[Manchuria]]. [[Primorskaya Oblast]] was established as a separate [[administrative division of the Russian Empire]] in 1856, with its administrative center at [[Khabarovsk]].

Several entities with the name "Far East" had existed in the first half of the 20th century, all with rather different boundaries:
*1920–1922: the [[Far Eastern Republic]], which included [[Transbaikal Oblast|Transbaikal]], [[Amur Oblast|Amur]], [[Primorskaya Oblast|Primorskaya]], and [[Kamchatka Oblast]]s and northern [[Sakhalin]];
*1922–1926: {{ill|Far-Eastern Oblast|ru|Дальневосточная область}}, which the [[Guberniya]] included [[Amur Governorate|Amur]], [[Transbaikal Governorate|Transbaikal]], [[Kamchatka Governorate|Kamchatka]], and
*1926–1938: [[Far-Eastern Krai]], which included modern [[Primorsky Krai|Primorsky]] and [[Khabarovsk Krai]]s.

Until 2000, the Russian Far East lacked officially defined boundaries.  A single term "Siberia and the Far East" ({{lang|ru|Сибирь и Дальний Восток}}) was often used to refer to Russia's regions east of the [[Ural mountains|Urals]] without drawing a clear distinction between "Siberia" and "the Far East".

[[File:Annual procession with the Albazin icon.jpg|thumb|Annual procession with the Albazin icon of [[Theotokos]], [[Jewish Autonomous Region]].]]
In 2000, Russia's [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]] were grouped into larger [[federal districts of Russia|federal districts]], and the [[Far Eastern Federal District]] was created, comprising [[Amur Oblast]], [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]], [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]], [[Kamchatka Oblast]] with [[Koryak Autonomous Okrug]], [[Khabarovsk Krai]], [[Magadan Oblast]], [[Primorsky Krai]], the [[Sakha Republic|Sakha (Yakutia) Republic]], and [[Sakhalin Oblast]]. Since 2000, the term "Far East" has been increasingly used in Russia to refer to the federal district, though it is often also used more loosely.

Defined by the boundaries of the federal district, the Far East has an area of 6.2 million square kilometers—over one-third of Russia's total area.

===Russo-Japanese War===

{{Further|Russo-Japanese War}}

Russia in the early 1900s persistently sought a warm water port on the [[Pacific Ocean]] for the navy as well as to facilitate maritime trade. The recently established Pacific seaport of [[Vladivostok]] was operational only during the summer season, but [[Lüshunkou|Port Arthur]] in [[Manchuria]] was operational all year. After the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the failure of the 1903 negotiations between [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and the Tsars's government, Japan chose war to protect its domination of [[Korea]] and adjacent territories. Russia, meanwhile, saw war as a means of distracting its populace from government repression and of rallying patriotism in the aftermath of several general strikes. Japan issued a declaration of war on 8&amp;nbsp;February 1904. However, three hours before Japan's declaration of war was received by the Russian Government, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] attacked the Russian Far East Fleet at Port Arthur. Eight days later Russia declared war on Japan.

The war ended in September 1905 with a Japanese victory following the fall of Port Arthur and the failed Russian invasion of Japan through the Korean Peninsula and [[Northeast China]]; also, Japan had threatened to invade [[Primorsky Krai]] via Korea. The [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] was later signed and both Japan and Russia agreed to evacuate Manchuria and return its sovereignty to China, but Japan was allowed to lease the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] (containing Port Arthur and [[Talien]]), and the Russian rail system in southern Manchuria with its access to strategic resources. Japan also received the southern half of the Island of Sakhalin from Russia. Russia was also forced to confiscate land from Korean settlers who formed the majority of Primorsky Krai's population due to a fear of an invasion of Korea and ousting of Japanese troops by Korean guerrillas.

===Soviet era===
[[File:Ukrainians in Russian regions 1926.jpg|thumb|250px|Number and share of [[Ukrainians in Russia|Ukrainians]] in the population of the regions of the [[RSFSR]] (1926 census)]]
Between 1937 and 1939, the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin deported [[Koryo-saram|over 200,000 Koreans]] to [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kazakhstan]], fearing that the Koreans might act as spies for Japan. Many Koreans died on the way in cattle trains due to starvation, illness, or freezing conditions. Many community leaders were purged and executed, [[Koryo-saram]] were not allowed to travel outside of Central Asia for the next 15&amp;nbsp;years. Koreans were also not allowed to use the Korean language and its use began to become lost with the involvement of [[Koryo-mar]] and the use of Russian.

Development of numerous remote locations relied on [[GULAG]] labour camps during Stalin's rule, especially in the region's northern half. After that, the large-scale use of [[forced labour]] waned and was superseded by volunteer employees attracted by relatively high wages.

====Soviet–Japanese conflicts====
{{Main|Soviet–Japanese border conflicts}}
During the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931, the Soviets occupied [[Bolshoy Ussuriysky Island]], [[Yinlong Island]], and several adjacent islets to separate the city of [[Khabarovsk]] from the territory controlled by a possibly hostile power.&lt;ref&gt;Russian possession of the eastern half of these lands was recognized by [[People's Republic of China]] in [[Complementary Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation on the Eastern Section of the China–Russia Boundary|the treaty of 2004]], whereas the western half was then returned to China.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, Japan turned its military interests to Soviet territories. Conflicts between the Japanese and the Soviets frequently happened on the border of Manchuria between 1938 and 1945. The first confrontation occurred in Primorsky Krai, the [[Battle of Lake Khasan]] was an attempted military incursion of Manchukuo (Japanese) into the territory claimed by the Soviet Union. This incursion was founded in the beliefs of the Japanese side that the Soviet Union misinterpreted the demarcation of the boundary based on the Treaty of Peking between Imperial Russia and Manchu China. Primorsky Krai was always threatened by a Japanese invasion despite the fact that most of the remaining clashes occurred in Manchukuo.

The clashes ended shortly before the conclusion of the World War II when a weakened Japan found its territories of Manchukuo, [[Mengjiang]], Korea, and [[South Sakhalin]] invaded by Soviet and Mongolian troops.

====World War II====
{{main|Pacific War|Soviet–Japanese War}}
Primorsky Krai was a strategic location in World War II for both the Soviet Union and Japan and clashes over the territory were common as the Soviets and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] considered it a key location to [[Operation Downfall|invade Japan]] through Korea, and Japan viewed it as a key location to begin a mass invasion of Eastern Russia. Primorsky Krai also served as the Soviet Union's Pacific headquarters in the war to plan an invasion for allied troops of Korea in order to reach Japan.

After the Soviet invasion, Manchukuo and Mengjiang were returned to China and Korea became liberated. The Soviet Union also occupied and annexed [[Kuril Islands]] and southern Sakhalin. Soviet invasion of Japan proper never happened.

====Cold War====
During the [[Korean War]], Primorsky Krai became the site of extreme security concern for the Soviet Union.

[[Vladivostok]] was the site of the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] in 1974. At the time, the Soviet Union and the United States decided quantitative limits on various nuclear weapons systems and banned the construction of new land-based ICBM launchers. Vladivostok and other cities in Primorsky Krai soon became [[closed cities]] because of the base of the [[Soviet Pacific Fleet]].

Incursions of [[United States|American]] [[reconnaissance aircraft]] from nearby [[Alaska]] sometimes happened. These concerns of the Soviet military caused the infamous [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] incident in 1983.

====Russian Homestead Act====
In 2016, President [[Vladimir Putin]] proposed the [[Russian Homestead Act]] to populate the Russian Far East.

====Russian-Japanese relations in the 21st century====
Japanese citizens can visit Russian Vladivostok under a simplified visa regime. A simplified electronic visa to Primorsky Krai in 2016 brought 1338 citizens of Japan.

==Demographics==
===Population===
[[File:RIAN archive 370051 Students celebrating St.Tatyana's Day, or Russian Students Day.jpg|thumb|Students in [[Vladivostok]] celebrating [[Tatiana Day|St. Tatyana's Day]], or Russian Students Day]]
[[File:Population of the Russian Far East, 1990-2015.png|thumb|Graph depicting population change in the Russian Far East]]
According to the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]], [[Far Eastern Federal District]] had a population of&amp;nbsp;6,293,129.
Most of it is concentrated in the southern parts.  Given the vast territory of the Russian Far East, 6.3&amp;nbsp;million people translates to slightly less than one person per square kilometer, making the Russian Far East one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world.  The population of the Russian Far East has been rapidly declining since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (even more so than for Russia in general), dropping by 14% in the last fifteen years.  The Russian government has been discussing a range of re-population programs to avoid the forecast drop to 4.5 million people by 2015, hoping to attract in particular the remaining Russian population of the [[near abroad]] but eventually agreeing on a program to resettle Ukrainian Illegal immigrants.

Ethnic [[Russians]] and [[Ukrainians]] make up the majority of the population.

===Cities===
75% of the population is urban.  The largest cities are:

*[[Blagoveshchensk]]
*[[Yakutsk]]
*[[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]]
*[[Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk]]
*[[Nakhodka]]
*[[Ussuriysk]]

===Ukrainian Resettlement Program===
In 2016 an ambitious program was approved which hoped to resettle at least 500,000 Ukrainians in the Far East. This included giving free land to attract voluntary immigrants from Ukraine and the settlement of refugees from [[East Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/politics/332629-go-east-government-supports-plan/|title=Go East!

===Traditional ethnic groups===
The original population groups of the Russian Far East include (grouped by language group):
*[[Turkic Languages|Turkic]]: [[Yakuts|Sakha]]
*[[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]]: [[Aleut people|Aleut]]s, [[Siberian Yupik]]s (Yuits)

==Transportation==
[[File:Метеор-236 на Лене.JPG|thumb|Transportation on the [[Lena River]]]]
The region was not connected with the rest of Russia via domestic highways, until [[M58 highway (Russia)|M58 highway]] was completed in 2010.

Uniquely for Russia, most cars have [[Right Hand Drive]] (73% of all cars in the region),&lt;ref name="rhdcars"&gt;{{cite news|title=В России посчитали всех "праворуких"|url=http://auto.vesti.ru/news/show/news_id/672782/ccl_id/23/|accessdate=24 April 2017|work=auto.vesti.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; though traffic still flows on the right-hand side of the road.

Railways were better developed. The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and [[Baikal–Amur Mainline]] (since 1984) provide connection with Siberia (and the rest of the country). [[Amur–Yakutsk Mainline]] is aimed to link the city of [[Yakutsk]] to the Russian railway network. Passenger trains reach [[Nizhny Bestyakh]] as of 2013.

Like in nearby Siberia, for many remote localities, aviation is the main mode of transportation to/from civilisation, but the infrastructure is often poor.

Maritime transport is also important for delivering supplies to localities at (or near) the Pacific and [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] coasts.

[[File:Sandworm by Marco Casagrande, interior.jpg|thumb|The interior of the Sandworm, nicknamed the "willow cathedral"]]

'''''Sandworm''''' (2012) is a [[site-specific art]] installation and a fusion of [[environmental art]] and [[architecture]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://free-d.nl/project/show/id/914 SANDWORM (Wenduine, Belgium)] - ''free-D'' 2012&lt;/ref&gt; by Finnish architect [[Marco Casagrande]] situated on the [[dune]]s of [[Wenduine]] beach in [[Belgium]]. The curvaceous structure is made entirely from [[willow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://inhabitat.com/woven-willow-sandworm-rises-from-a-belgian-beach/ Marco Casagrande's Woven Willow Sandworm Rises from a Belgian Beach] - ''Lori Zimmer, Inhabitat'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt; 
The  fifty-metre long organic structure stretches out between the dunes like an enormous wooden worm. It is part of the Beaufort Triennial of [[Contemporary art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beaufort04.be/en/artistiek/31/marco-casagrande-.html Marco Casagrande] - ''Beaufort04 – Selection of Artists'' 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

The installation is an organic shell built from willow branches woven through arches of various heights placed at a length of 45 meters and a height and width of 10 meters.  It falls within a local long tradition of willow weaving normally more modest in scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detail-online.com/daily/sandworm-wenduine-coast-belgium-by-marco-casagrande-c-laboratory-3212/ Sandworm: Wenduine coast, Belgium by Marco Casagrande / C-Laboratory.] - ''Detail Daily'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt;   Sandworm has been created in an undulating shape upon the tidal beaches of Wenduine town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designboom.com/art/casagrande-laboratory-sandworm-at-beaufort04/|title=casagrande laboratory: sandworm at beaufort04|work=designboom - architecture &amp; design magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a distance, the mounds of tree remnants suggest the form of a massive creature, emerging out of the ground. Up close, visitors can investigate the textured surface of the structure, and they are invited to interact with the sculpture by walking through the interior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/marco-casagrande-sandworm Walking Through a Glowing Sandworm on the Shoreline] - ''Katie Hosmer, My Modern Metropolis'' 10/2012&lt;/ref&gt; The space is used for picnics, relaxation and “post industrial [[meditation]]”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.arq.com.mx/Detalles/13157.html#.UO50f29Sizk Arquitectura: SANDWORM : Marco Casagrande] - ''Buscador de Arquitectura'' 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Building on [[Claude Monet|Monet]]’s beliefs that  it is only the surrounding atmosphere that gives subjects their true value, Casagrande works in harmony with the air and light in this architectural piece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmygoodness.com/2013/01/11/art-and-eco-system/ Art and eco-system] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723012154/http://www.allmygoodness.com/2013/01/11/art-and-eco-system/ |date=2013-07-23 }} - ''Robynne Collins, allmygoodness'' 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

Casagrande describes the work as “weak architecture” – a human-made structure that wishes to become part of nature through flexibility and organic presence. The visitors are describing the Sandworm as a willow [[cathedral]] finely tuned to celebrate the site specific conditions of the Wenduine tidal beaches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archdaily.com/223656/sandworm-marco-casagrande/ SANDWORM / Marco Casagrande] - ''Diego Hernandez, Arch Daily'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt; As one visitor, Peter Beyen, puts it: “The artist believes that architectural control goes against nature and thus also against architecture… To the Finnish artist Marco Casagrande designing is not sufficient. Design should not replace reality. The building must grow out of the location, it must react to its environment, it must be a reflection of life and also be itself, as every other living being.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://trendland.com/marco-casagrandes-sandworm/# MARCO CASAGRANDE’S SANDWORM] - ''Katarina Tan, Trendland'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Casagrande believes that the built human environment should be a mediator between human nature and nature itself. To be part of this, man must be weak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch2o.com/sandworm-marco-casagrande/ Sandworm | Marco Casagrande] - ''Matt Davis, ARCH2O 8/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suur Munamägi''' (in translation "Big Egg Mountain") is the highest peak in [[Estonia]] (and the [[Baltic states]]), reaching {{convert|318|m|ft}} above [[sea level]]. It is located near the village of [[Haanja]], in [[Võru County]] in the south-eastern corner of Estonia, close to the borders of both [[Latvia]] and [[Russia]]. The landscape around the peak - the [[Haanja Upland]] - is gently hilly.

== History ==
[[File:Vaatetorn Suurel Munamäel.jpg|thumb| Observation Tower on Suur Munamagi]]
[[File:Haanja kõrgustik.jpg|thumb| Suur Munamagi in Southern Estonia]] 
On the hill, there have been 5 towers. The first tower, built in 1812, is the subject of a folk legend: it was supposedly destroyed because it confused ships headed toward the coast. The second tower was built in 1870 by a local barman. The tower was {{convert|8|m|ft}} high. The tower was popular amongst local people because of its bar. Only 4–5 people fit in the tower and the trees started to ruin the view.

The third tower was built on the same building as the second tower. The tower was built up to {{convert|12|m|ft}}.

The fourth tower was built in 1925, when Estonia was an independent state. The tower was built in 3 months and it was {{convert|17|m|ft}} high. The Võru county then built paths for people, cleaned the forest and put benches in front of the tower. The fourth tower was ceremonially opened on 19 July 1925. Soon after that people realized that the wooden tower was old and again the trees started blocking the view — 17 metres was not high enough.

The new fifth tower was built of [[ferroconcrete]] in 1939. The tower was made {{convert|25.7|m|ft}} high. It was built of 36 000 bricks and 80 tons of cement which all were carried up to the mountain. The tower was finished in the same year in June but the ceremonial opening was cancelled because of [[World War II]]. The tower was not seriously harmed in war and the repair was made in 1955. The Memorial Museum of Fr.R. Kreutzwald that was at that time the owner of the tower, started to modernize the tower and fix its surroundings.

[[File:Suur-Munamäe vaatetorn.jpg|thumb|left|The tower]]
[[File:Haanja Upland.jpg|thumb|Hilly and forested landscape around Suur Munamägi]]
In 1969 the museum built an additional floor on the top of the tower and changed the construction of the stairway on the top floors. The add-on was engineered by Toomas Rein and Veljo Kaasik. The tower was now {{convert|29.1|m|ft}} high. The view from the height of {{convert|346.7|m|ft}} is {{convert|50|km|0}} in radius.

A renovation project of the tower was started in 1998 by Haanja parish. In 1999–2000 Toomas Rein carried it out. In 2002 the piping of the tower was engineered and completed next year. From August 2004 to July 2005 major renovation works were made on Suur Munamägi: the observation tower was renovated, the tower’s elevator and glass café were built, the paths to the tower re-made, the lightning of the pedestrian path and the tower was made. The total cost of the works was ca 10 million [[Estonian kroon|kroons]]. The construction was financed by the EU [[Phare]] program, Enterprise Estonia, the Estonian government, Environmental Investment Centre, private supporters and the budget of the parish.

On 24 July 2005 the renovated observation tower of Suur Munamägi was festively opened.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9934">'''Tactile graphics''', including '''tactile pictures''', '''tactile diagrams''', '''tactile maps''', and '''tactile graphs''', are images that use raised surfaces so that a [[Visual impairment|visually impaired]] person can feel them. They are used to convey non-textual information such as maps, paintings, graphs and diagrams.

Tactile graphics can be seen as a subset of [[accessible image]]s. Images can be made accessible to the visually impaired in various ways, such as verbal description, sound, or [[haptic perception|haptic]] (tactual) feedback.
One of the most common uses for tactile graphics is the production of tactile maps.

==Tactile maps==
[[File:Disability5 200.jpg|thumb|Paper tactile map]]
The types and forms of tactile maps began with the oldest and most rudimentary or a mixed media format. This tactile map is produced by simply attaching objects to a substrate to represent different items or symbols. More recent tactile maps are produced by computers through different means such as an ink-jet printers.

'''Thermoform''' is one of the most common methods of producing tactile maps. This process is also known as [[vacuum forming]]. Thermoform maps or plans are created from a process where a sheet of plastic is heated and vacuumed on top of a model or master. The master can be made from many substances, although certain materials are more durable than others. Since this process involves creating a mold, it is somewhat time consuming.

'''Swell paper''' has a special coating of heat-reactive chemicals. Microcapsules of alcohol implanted in the paper fracture when exposed to heat and make the surface of the paper inflate. Placing black ink on the paper prior to a heat process provides control over the raised surface areas. This type of map is not as robust as the Thermoform map, but can be produced with less effort and expense.

'''Modified [[Braille embosser]]s''' can also be used to produce tactile paper maps.&lt;ref&gt;McCallum, Don. et al. 2005. The design and manufacture of tactile maps using an ink-jet process. Journal of Engineering Design. Vol. 16, no. 6. December. pp. 525–544. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ink-jet tactile maps''' are made by layering a specially designed ink. Each layer is cured by UV irradiation before the next layer is added. This technology is an offshoot of other industries, such as circuit board manufacturing and biomedical applications.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Kafeel., McCallum, Don., &amp; Sheldon, Derek F. 2005. Multiphase Micro-Drop Interaction In Ink-jet Printing of 3D Structures for Tactile Maps. Modern Physics Letters B. Nos. 28&amp;29 pp. 1699–1702. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

The substrate for tactile maps is a very important attribute, since different materials can enhance or reduce legibility and durability. Several types of substrates can be used to produce a tactile map. These include rough and smooth plastic, rough and smooth paper, microcapsule paper, Braillon, and aluminum. Many factors should be considered when choosing a [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]]; these include but are not limited to function, durability, and portability.&lt;ref&gt;Jehoel, Sandra. et al. 2005. An Evaluation of Substrates for Tactile Maps and Diagrams:
Scanning Speed and Users’ Preferences. Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness. February. pp. 85–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tactile map variables:''' Just as [[Jacques Bertin]] retinal variables help determine how visual maps are produced; tactile maps have a formula as well. Although researchers have not standardized tactile map variables, these nine are usually included depending on the ''substrate'': vibration, flutter, pressure, temperature, size, shape, texture/grain, orientation, and elevation.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, A.L. 2002 Feeling it out : the use of haptic visualization for exploratory geographic visualization. Cartographic Perspectives, 39. pp. 12–29&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Typical tactile elevations:''' Thermoformed maps usually have an elevation of at least 1mm. Swell Paper averages 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm and braille embossers have a range from 0.25–1&amp;nbsp;mm. Ink-jet printers can be controlled to vary elevation as needed. A (2009) study conducted by Sandra Jehoel tested various height levels and estimated that preferred tactile elevations fall between 40 and 80 micrometres depending on the substrate background, shape of the object and smoothness of lines. Symbols such as a triangle, square and a circle should have a minimum base line length of 6.4, 5.0 and 5.5&amp;nbsp;mm respectively for proper recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Jehoel, Sandra. et al. 2005. An Evaluation of Substrates for Tactile Maps and Diagrams:
Scanning Speed and Users’ Preferences. Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness. February. pp. 85–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Audio tactile maps''' or [[graphic tablet]]s are interactive devices. Electronic tactile talking touch pad instruments use [[Macromedia Flash]] software with audio files to convey information to the blind or visually impaired user. As the user’s finger engages a feature or symbol a recording provides information about the object, symbol or area. For example, the sound of splashing water can be used for areas such as rivers or oceans. This format has great potential for transmitting information over the Internet which can be downloaded to a computer or hand-held device.&lt;ref&gt;Siekierska, Eva., Muller, Anita. 2003. Tactile and Audio-tactile Maps within the Canadian Government On-Line Program. The Cartography Journal. Vol 40, 3. pp. 299–304.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
A great deal of hardware already exists that can be used by the blind or visually impaired to interact with computer screen graphics. A vibrating mouse or other force feedback devices can be adapted to turn any visual software generated map into a hybrid tactile map. The interactive signal to a device can be varied when crossing a boundary or symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Golledge, Reginald G, Rice Matthew., &amp; Jacobson Denial R. 2005. A Commentary on the use of Touch for Accessing On-Screen Spatial Representations: The Process of Experiencing Haptic Maps and Graphics. The Professional Geographer. 57, 3 pp. 339–349.&lt;/ref&gt;

High resolution refreshable braille displays containing 1,500 to 12,000 pixels are already available in market. Graphic braille display available in the market is DV-2 (from KGS &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kgs-jpn.co.jp/ | title=Home of KGS Corporation|publisher=KGS Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with 1,536 pixels, Hyperbraille &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hyperbraille.de/?lang=en | title=Hyperbraille|publisher=Hyperbraille}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 7,200 pixels and TACTISPLAY Table/Walk (from Tactisplay Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tactisplay.com/ | title=Home of Tactisplay Corp.|publisher=Tactisplay Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with 2,400/12,000 pixels respectively. TACTISPLAY table &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tactisplay.com/product/tactisplay-table | title=Full Page Braille Display being Launched by Tactisplay Corp.|publisher=Tactisplay Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; has total 12,000 pixels arranged in 120x100.

'''Zoom maps''' are a recently developed tactile map. These maps are designed specifically for those who can read braille and have had no previous interaction with tactile maps. The term zoom is comparable to a zoom-able visual [[wikt: raster|raster]] internet map. A country is divided into regions on the first map then the next zoomed map will have a breakdown of the regions and so forth until a city level is reached. These successive maps rely on a dependable texture as the map zoom progresses. This produces a familiarity as one zooms from the proceeding map. This is achieved in many instances with line orientation, area and consistent shape. The Braille text on the map is placed next to a rectangular textured legend for area identification.&lt;ref&gt;Yayla, Lisa. 2009. Huseby Zoom Maps: A design Methodology for Tactile Graphics. Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness. May. pp. 270–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[DC Comics]] '''''Université Notre Dame des Ombres''''' ({{lang-fr|Our Lady of the Shadows University}}) is a special university in [[France]] which was attended by the [[Crimson Fox]] twins and Dee Tyler ([[Phantom Lady]]).

Sandra Knight, the original Phantom Lady, became the dean of this School in her later years. She may have been an 'old girl' herself, as was the English girl Emma Knight, daughter of Sir John Knight, who went on to become an agent herself in the 1960s as [[The Avengers (TV series)|Mrs. Emma Peel]] (see ''Action Comics Weekly'' #636).

Records of other graduates are still classified as "Top Secret", but given the school's location and 200 year history, it is possible that other female spies may well have passed through the doors of this fabled institution, including such as agents known under the code names of [[Sandra of the Secret Service]], [[Mademoiselle Marie]] and [[Madame Zero]].  Obviously, given the nature of these ladies' line of work, any form of verification is impossible.

''Action Comics Weekly'' #641 reveals that the future Diana Tyler, mother of the second [[Phantom Lady]], was connected to the college until the mid-1960s, although she may well have been a tutor rather than a trainee agent.
