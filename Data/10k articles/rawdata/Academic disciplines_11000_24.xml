      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2644">A fundamental tool in [[statistical mechanics]] and [[Combinatorics#Probabilistic_combinatorics|probabilistic combinatorics]] (especially [[random graph]]s and the [[probabilistic method]]), the '''Ahlswede–Daykin inequality'''  {{harv|Ahlswede|Daykin|1978}}, also known as the '''four functions theorem''' (or '''inequality'''), 
is a [[correlation]]-type inequality for four functions on a finite [[distributive lattice]].

It states that if &lt;math&gt;f_1,f_2,f_3,f_4&lt;/math&gt; are nonnegative functions on a finite distributive lattice such that

:&lt;math&gt;f_1(x)f_2(y)\le f_3(x\vee y)f_4(x\wedge y)&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'', ''y'' in the lattice, then 

:&lt;math&gt;f_1(X)f_2(Y)\le f_3(X\vee Y)f_4(X\wedge Y)&lt;/math&gt;

for all subsets ''X'', ''Y'' of the lattice, where

:&lt;math&gt;f(X) = \sum_{x\in X}f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;X\vee Y = \{x\vee y\mid x\in X, y\in Y\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;X\wedge Y = \{x\wedge y\mid x\in X, y\in Y\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Ahlswede–Daykin inequality can be used to provide a short proof of both the [[Holley inequality]] and the [[FKG inequality]]. It also implies the [[Fishburn–Shepp inequality]].

For a proof, see the original article {{harv|Ahlswede|Daykin|1978}} or {{harv|Alon|Spencer|2000}}.

==Generalizations==

The "four functions theorem" was independently generalized to 2''k'' functions in {{harv|Aharoni|Keich|1996}} and {{harv|Rinott|Saks|1991}}.

[[File:Toxic Algae Bloom in Lake Erie.jpg|400px|thumb|Taken from orbit in October 2011, the worst algae bloom that [[Lake Erie]] has experienced in decades.

An '''algal bloom''' or '''algae bloom''' is a rapid increase or accumulation in the population of [[algae]] in freshwater or marine water systems, and is recognized by the discoloration in the water from their pigments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferris |first=Robert |date=July 26, 2016 |title=Why are there so many toxic algae blooms this year |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/26/why-are-there-so-many-toxic-algae-blooms-this-year.html |newspaper=[[CNBC]] |access-date=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyanobacteria]] were mistaken for algae in the past, so cyanobacterial blooms are sometimes also called algal blooms. Blooms which can injure animals or the ecology are called "[[harmful algal blooms]]" (HAB), and can lead to fish die-offs, cities cutting off water to residents, or states having to close fisheries.

== Blooming ==
[[Image:River algae Sichuan.jpg|thumb|Algal blooms can present problems for [[ecosystem]]s and human society.]]
Since 'algae' is a broad term including organisms of widely varying sizes, growth rates and nutrient requirements, there is no officially recognized threshold level as to what is defined as a bloom. For some species, algae can be considered to be blooming at concentrations reaching millions of cells per milliliter, while others form blooms of tens of thousands of cells per liter. The photosynthetic pigments in the algal cells determine the color of the algal bloom, and are thus often a greenish color, but they can also be a wide variety of other colors such as yellow, brown or red, depending on the species of algae and the type of pigments contained therein.

Bright green blooms in freshwater systems are frequently a result of [[cyanobacteria]] (colloquially known as "blue-green algae" as a result of their confusing taxonomical history) such as ''[[Microcystis aeruginosa|Microcystis]]''. Blooms may also consist of [[macroalgal]] (non-[[phytoplanktonic]]) species. These blooms are recognizable by large blades of algae that may wash up onto the shoreline.

Of particular note are the rare '''harmful algal blooms''' (HABs), which are algal bloom events involving toxic or otherwise harmful phytoplankton such as [[dinoflagellate]]s of the [[genus]] ''Alexandrium'' and ''Karenia'', or [[diatoms]] of the genus ''[[Pseudo-nitzschia]]''. Such blooms often take on a red or brown hue and are known colloquially as '''[[red tide]]s'''.

==Freshwater algal blooms==
{{Further|Nutrient pollution|Eutrophication}}
Freshwater algal blooms are the result of an [[Nutrient pollution|excess of nutrients]], particularly some [[phosphate]]s.&lt;ref name="Phytoplankton Blooms: The Basics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Diersling|first=Nancy|title=Phytoplankton Blooms: The Basics|url=http://floridakeys.noaa.gov/scisummaries/wqpb.pdf|publisher=NOAA FKNMS|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lake Scientist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hochanadel|first=Dave|title=Limited amount of total phosphorus actually feeds algae, study finds|url=http://www.lakescientist.com/2010/limited-amount-of-total-phosphorus-actually-feeds-algae-study-finds|publisher=Lake Scientist|accessdate=10 June 2012|date=10 December 2010|quote=[B]ioavailable phosphorus – phosphorus that can be utilized by plants and bacteria – is only a fraction of the total, according to Michael Brett, a UW engineering professor ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excess of nutrients may originate from fertilizers that are applied to land for agricultural or recreational purposes.

Presence of [[Residual Sodium Carbonate Index|residual sodium carbonate]] acts as catalyst for the algae to bloom by providing dissolved carbon dioxide for enhanced photosynthesis in the presence of nutrients.

When phosphates are introduced into water systems, higher concentrations cause increased growth of algae and plants. Algae tend to grow very quickly under high nutrient availability, but each algal is short-lived, and the result is a high concentration of dead organic matter which starts to decay. The decay process consumes dissolved oxygen in the water, resulting in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] conditions. Without sufficient dissolved oxygen in the water, animals and plants may [[Dead zone (ecology)|die off]] in large numbers. Use of an [[Olszewski tube]] can help combat these problems with hypolimnetic withdrawal.

Blooms may be observed in [[freshwater aquarium]]s when fish are overfed and excess nutrients are not absorbed by plants. These are generally harmful for fish, and the situation can be corrected by changing the water in the tank and then reducing the amount of food given.

A ''harmful algal bloom'' (HAB) is an algal bloom that causes negative impacts to other organisms via production of natural toxins, mechanical damage to other organisms, or by other means. HABs are often associated with large-scale marine mortality events and have been associated with various types of [[shellfish poisoning]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

In studies at the population level bloom coverage has been significantly related to the risk of non-alcoholic [[liver disease]] death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cyanobacteria blooms and non-alcoholic liver disease: evidence from a county level ecological study in the United States | journal=Environ Health | date=2015 |author1=Feng Zhang |author2=Jiyoung Lee |author3=Song Liang |author4=CK Shum | pmc=4428243 | pmid=25948281 | doi=10.1186/s12940-015-0026-7 | volume=14 | page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
In the marine environment, single-celled, microscopic, plant-like organisms naturally occur in the well-lit surface layer of any body of water. These organisms, referred to as [[phytoplankton]] or microalgae, form the base of the food web upon which nearly all other marine organisms depend. Of the 5000+ species of marine phytoplankton that exist worldwide, about 2% are known to be harmful or toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Landsberg |first=J. H. |year=2002 |title=The effects of harmful algal blooms on aquatic organisms |journal=Reviews in Fisheries Science |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=113–390 |doi=10.1080/20026491051695 |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blooms of harmful algae can have large and varied impacts on marine ecosystems, depending on the species involved, the environment where they are found, and the mechanism by which they exert negative effects.

Harmful algal blooms have been observed to cause adverse effects to a wide variety of aquatic organisms, most notably marine mammals, sea turtles, seabirds and finfish. The impacts of HAB toxins on these groups can include harmful changes to their developmental, immunological, neurological, or reproductive capacities.  The most conspicuous effects of HABs on marine wildlife are large-scale mortality events associated with toxin-producing blooms. For example, a [[mass mortality event]] of 107 [[bottlenose dolphins]] occurred along the Florida panhandle in the spring of 2004 due to ingestion of contaminated [[menhaden]] with high levels of [[brevetoxin]].&lt;ref name="Flewelling LJ 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flewelling |first=L. J. |year=2005 |title=Red tides and marine mammal mortalities |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=435 |issue=7043 |pages=755–756 |doi=10.1038/nature435755a |pmid= 15944690|pmc=2659475 |display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2005Natur.435..755F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Manatee mortalities have also been attributed to brevetoxin but unlike dolphins, the main toxin vector was endemic seagrass species (''Thalassia testudinum'') in which high concentrations of brevetoxins were detected and subsequently found as a main component of the stomach contents of manatees.&lt;ref name="Flewelling LJ 2005"/&gt;

Additional marine mammal species, like the highly endangered [[North Atlantic Right Whale]], have been exposed to neurotoxins by preying on highly contaminated [[zooplankton]].&lt;ref name="Durbin E 2002"&gt;Durbin E ''et al'' (2002) North Atlantic right whale, ''Eubalaena glacialis'', exposed to paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins via a zooplankton vector, ''Calanus finmarchicus''. Harmful Algae I, : 243-251 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  With the summertime habitat of this species overlapping with seasonal blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate ''Alexandrium fundyense'', and subsequent copepod grazing, foraging right whales will ingest large concentrations of these contaminated [[copepods]].  Ingestion of such contaminated prey can affect respiratory capabilities, feeding behavior, and ultimately the reproductive condition of the population.&lt;ref name="Durbin E 2002"/&gt;

Immune system responses have been affected by brevetoxin exposure in another critically endangered species, the [[Loggerhead sea turtle]].  Brevetoxin exposure, via inhalation of aerosolized toxins and ingestion of contaminated prey, can have clinical signs of increased lethargy and muscle weakness in loggerhead sea turtles causing these animals to wash ashore in a decreased metabolic state with increases of immune system responses upon blood analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walsh |first=C.

Examples of common harmful effects of HABs include:
#the production of neurotoxins which cause mass mortalities in fish, seabirds, sea turtles, and marine mammals
#human illness or death via consumption of seafood contaminated by toxic algae&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

HABs occur in many regions of the world, and in the United States are recurring phenomena in multiple geographical regions.  The [[Gulf of Maine]] frequently experiences blooms of the [[dinoflagellate]] ''[[Alexandrium fundyense]]'', an organism that produces [[saxitoxin]], the neurotoxin responsible for [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]].  The well-known "Florida red tide" that occurs in the Gulf of Mexico is a HAB caused by ''[[Karenia brevis]]'', another dinoflagellate which produces brevetoxin, the neurotoxin responsible for [[neurotoxic shellfish poisoning]]. California coastal waters also experience seasonal blooms of ''[[Pseudo-nitzschia]]'', a [[diatom]] known to produce [[domoic acid]], the neurotoxin responsible for [[amnesic shellfish poisoning]]. Off the west coast of [[South Africa]], HABs caused by ''[[Alexandrium catanella]]'' occur every spring. These blooms of organisms cause severe disruptions in [[fishery|fisheries]] of these waters as the toxins in the phytoplankton cause filter-feeding [[shellfish]] in affected waters to become poisonous for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;

If the HAB event results in a high enough concentration of algae the water may become discoloured or murky, varying in colour from purple to almost pink, normally being red or green. Not all algal blooms are dense enough to cause water discolouration.

===Red tides===
[[File:Maré vermelha.JPG|thumb|A red tide]]
{{main|Red tide}}

''[[Red tide]]'' is a term often used synonymously with HABs in marine coastal areas; however, the term is misleading since algal blooms can widely vary in color, and growth of algae is unrelated to the [[tide]]s. The term ''algal bloom'' or ''harmful algal bloom'' has since replaced ''red tide'' as the appropriate description of this phenomenon.

===Causes of HABs===
It is unclear what causes HABs; their occurrence in some locations appears to be entirely natural,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adams |first=N. G. |last2=Lesoing |first2=M. |last3=Trainer |first3=V. L. |year=2000 |title=Environmental conditions associated with domoic acid in razor clams on the Washington coast |journal=J Shellfish Res |volume=19 |issue= |pages=1007–1015 |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in others they appear to be a result of human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lam |first=C. W. Y. |last2=Ho |first2=K. C. |year=1989 |chapter=Red tides in Tolo Harbor, Hong Kong |editor-last=Okaichi |editor-first=T. |editor2-last=Anderson |editor2-first=D.

The frequency and severity of HABs in some parts of the world have been linked to increased nutrient loading from human activities. In other areas, HABs are a predictable seasonal occurrence resulting from coastal upwelling, a natural result of the movement of certain ocean currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trainer |first=V. L. |last2=Adams |first2=N. G. |last3=Bill |first3=B. D. |last4=Stehr |first4=C. M. |last5=Wekell |first5=J.

The type of nitrates and phosphates available in the system are also a factor, since phytoplankton can grow at different rates depending on the relative abundance of these substances (e.g. [[ammonia]], [[urea]], nitrate ion). A variety of other nutrient sources can also play an important role in affecting algal bloom formation, including iron, silica or carbon.  Coastal [[water pollution]] produced by humans (including iron fertilization) and systematic increase in [[global warming|sea water temperature]] have also been suggested as possible contributing factors in HABs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moore |first=S. |year=2011 |title=Impacts of climate variability and future climate change on harmful algal blooms and human health |work=Proceedings of the Centers for Oceans and Human Health Investigators Meeting |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-7-S2-S4 |display-authors=etal |volume=7 |pages=S4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors such as iron-rich dust influx from large desert areas such as the [[Sahara]] are thought to play a role in causing HABs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walsh |year=2006 |title=Red tides in the Gulf of Mexico: Where, when, and why? |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=111 |issue= |pages=C11003 |doi=10.1029/2004JC002813 |bibcode=2006JGRC..11111003W|display-authors=etal|pmc=2856968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some algal blooms on the [[Pacific coast]] have also been linked to natural occurrences of large-scale climatic oscillations such as [[El Niño]] events.

Arte Público Press, Houston, Texas (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; it is unclear what initiates these blooms and how large a role [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] and natural factors play in their development. It is also unclear whether the apparent increase in frequency and severity of HABs in various parts of the world is in fact a real increase or is due to increased observation effort and advances in species identification technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Since many algal blooms are caused by a major influx of nutrient-rich runoff into a water body, programs to treat wastewater, reduce the overuse of fertilizers in agriculture and reducing the bulk flow of runoff can be effective for reducing severe algal blooms at river mouths, [[estuary|estuaries]], and the ocean directly in front of the river's mouth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="942">An '''alpha strike''' is a term referring to the event when an [[alpha particle]] enters a [[computer processor]], and modifying the data contained in that processor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4038173/Intel-scans-for-soft-errors-in-processor-designs Intel scans for soft errors in processor designs, Anthony Cataldo]&lt;/ref&gt; These can cause data corruption or system shutdown, and are becoming an increasing problem as [[transistor]] sizes are reduced.

Physically, what happens in an alpha strike is that the alpha particle excites
electrons via [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|electronic stopping power]] in the material, and these may disrupt the normal electronic state of a memory component. The particle can
also leave [[Point defect|permanent defects]] in the components via [[collision cascade]]s.

In [[artificial intelligence]] research, the '''situated approach''' builds agents that are designed to behave effectively successfully in their environment. This requires designing AI "from the bottom-up" by focussing on the basic perceptual and motor skills required to survive. The situated approach gives a much lower priority to abstract reasoning or problem-solving skills.

The approach was originally proposed as an alternative to traditional approaches (that is, approaches popular before 1985 or so).
After several decades, classical [[AI]] technologies started to face intractable issues (e.g. combinatorial explosion) when confronted with real-world modeling problems. All approaches to address these issues focus on modeling intelligences situated in an environment. They have become known as the situated approach to AI.

==Emergence of a concept==

=== From traditional AI to Nouvelle AI===
During the late 1980s, the approach now known as '''Nouvelle AI''' (''Nouvelle'' means new in French) was pioneered at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] by [[Rodney Brooks]]. As opposed to classical or traditional [[artificial intelligence]], Nouvelle AI purposely avoided the traditional goal of modeling human-level performance, but rather tries to create systems with intelligence at the level of insects, closer to real-world robots. But eventually, at least at [[MIT]] new AI did lead to an attempt for humanoid AI in [[Cog (project)|the Cog Project]].

===From Nouvelle AI to behavior-based and situated AI===
The conceptual shift introduced by nouvelle AI flourished in the robotics area, given way to '''behavior-based artificial intelligence''' (BBAI), a [[methodology]] for developing [[AI]] based on a modular decomposition of intelligence. It was made famous by [[Rodney Brooks]]: his [[subsumption architecture]] was one of the earliest attempts to describe a mechanism for developing BBAI. It is extremely popular in [[robotics]] and to a lesser extent to implement [[Intelligent agent|intelligent virtual agents]] because it allows the successful creation of real-time dynamic systems that can run in complex environments.  For example, it underlies the intelligence of the [[Sony]], [[Aibo]] and many [[RoboCup]] robot teams.

Realizing that in fact all these approaches were aiming at building not an abstract intelligence, but rather an intelligence '''situated''' in a given environment, they have come to be known as the situated approach. In fact, this approach stems out from early insights of [[Alan Turing]], describing the need to build machines equipped with sense organs to learn directly from the real-world instead of focusing on abstract activities, such as playing chess.{{Relevance-inline|This theory certainly has been put forward by philosophers long before Turing. There is no need to compete who formulated a vague idea first.}}

==Definitions==
Classically, a software entity is defined as a simulated element, able to act on itself and on its environment, and which has an internal representation of itself and of the outside world. An entity can communicate with other entities, and its behavior is the consequence of its perceptions, its representations, and its interactions with the other entities.

===AI loop===
Simulating entities in a virtual environment requires simulating the entire process that goes from a perception of the environment, or more generally from a stimulus, to an action on the environment. This process is called the AI loop and technology used to simulate it can be subdivided in two categories. ''Sensorimotor or low-level'' AI deals with either the perception problem (what is perceived?) or the animation problem (how are actions executed?). ''Decisional or high-level'' AI deals with the action selection problem (what is the most appropriate action in response to a given perception, i.e. what is the most appropriate behavior?).

===Traditional or symbolic AI===
There are two main approaches in decisional AI. The vast majority of the technologies available on the market, such as [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning algorithms]], [[finite state machines]] (FSA), or [[expert systems]], are based on the '''traditional or symbolic''' AI approach. Its main characteristics are:
* It is '''top-down''': it subdivides, in a recursive manner, a given problem into a series of sub-problems that are supposedly easier to solve.
* It is '''knowledge-based''': it relies on a symbolic description of the world, such as a set of rules.

However, the limits of traditional AI, which goal is to build systems that mimic human intelligence, are well-known: inevitably, a [[combinatorial explosion]] of the number of rules occurs due to the complexity of the environment. In fact, it is impossible to predict all the situations that will be encountered by an autonomous entity.

===Situated or behavioral AI===
In order to address these issues, another approach to decisional AI, also known as '''situated or behavioral''' AI, has been proposed. It does not attempt to model systems that produce deductive reasoning processes, but rather systems that '''behave realistically in their environment'''. The main characteristics of this approach are the following:
* It is '''bottom-up''': it relies on elementary behaviors, which can be combined to implement more complex behaviors.
* It is '''behavior-based''': it does not rely on a symbolic description of the environment, but rather on a model of the interactions of the entities with their environment.

The goal of situated AI is to model entities that are autonomous in their environment. This is achieved thanks to both the intrinsic robustness of the control architecture, and its adaptation capabilities to unforeseen situations.

===Situated agents===
In [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]], the term '''situated''' refers to an [[Intelligent agent|agent]] which is [[embedded systems|embedded]] in an environment. The term ''situated'' is commonly used to refer to [[robot]]s, but some researchers argue that [[software]] agents can also be situated if:

* they exist in a [[dynamical system|dynamic]] (rapidly changing) environment, which
* they can [[wikt:manipulate|manipulate]] or change through their actions, and which
* they can [[sense]] or [[Perception|perceive]].

Examples might include web-based agents, which can alter data or trigger processes (such as purchases) over the Internet, or virtual-reality bots which inhabit and change virtual worlds, such as [[Second Life]].

Being situated is generally considered to be part of being [[Embodied embedded cognition|embodied]], but it is useful to consider each perspective individually.  The situated perspective emphasizes that intelligent behavior derives from the environment and the agent's [[interaction]]s with it. The nature of these interactions are defined by an agent's embodiment.

==Implementation principles==

=== Modular decomposition===
The most important attribute of a system driven by situated AI is that the intelligence is controlled by a set of independent semi-[[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] modules. In the original systems, each module was actually a separate [[peripheral|device]] or was at least conceived of as running on its own [[Process (computing)|processing]] [[thread (computer science)|thread]]. Generally, though, the modules are just [[abstraction]]s. In this respect, situated AI may be seen as a [[software engineering]] approach to AI, perhaps akin to [[object-oriented programming|object oriented design]].

Situated AI is often associated with [[reactive planning]], but the two are not synonymous. Brooks advocated an extreme version of [[cognitive minimalism]] which required initially that the behavior modules were [[finite state machines]] and thus contained no conventional [[memory]] or [[learning]]. This is associated with reactive AI because reactive AI requires reacting to the current state of the world, not to an [[Intelligent agent|agent]]'s memory or preconception of that world. However, learning is obviously key to realistic [[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI]], so this constraint has been relaxed, though not entirely abandoned.

===Action selection mechanism===
The situated AI community has presented several solutions to modeling decision-making processes, also known as action selection mechanisms. The first attempt to solve this problem goes back to ''subsumption architectures'',&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, R. (1986). A robust layered control system for a mobile robot. IEEE Journal of Robotics and Automation 2(1):14-23.&lt;/ref&gt; which were in fact more an implementation technique than an algorithm. However, this attempt paved the way to several others, in particular the ''free-flow hierarchies''&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblatt J. and Payton D (1989). A fine-grained alternative to the subsumption architecture for mobile robot control. In: Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks 2:317-324.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''activation networks''.&lt;ref&gt;Maes P. (1989). How to do the right thing. Technical Report AIM-1180, MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison of the structure and performances of these two mechanisms demonstrated the advantage of using ''free-flow hierarchies'' in solving the action selection problem.&lt;ref&gt;Tyrrell T. (1993). Computational mechanisms for action selection. PhD, University of Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyrrell T (1993). The use of hierarchies for action selection. Adaptive Behavior 1(4):387-420.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''motor schemas''&lt;ref&gt;Arkin R. Motor schema based navigation for a mobile robot: an approach to programming by behavior. In: Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 264-271, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''process description languages''&lt;ref&gt;Steels, L. (1993). Building agents with autonomous behavior systems. In: The artificial route to artificial intelligence. Building situated embodied agents. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, New Haven.&lt;/ref&gt; are two other approaches that have been used with success for autonomous robots.

'''Auger architectomics''' is a scientific imaging technique that allows biologists, working in the field of [[nano-technology]], to slice open the cells of living organisms to view and assess their internal workings. Using [[argon gas]] etching to open the cells and an [[scanning electron microscope]] to create a three-dimensional view, researchers can harness this technique to track how cells function. This is most importantly used to assess how cells react to medication, for instance in the field of cancer research.

It was first discovered in 2010 by Professor Lodewyk Kock and his team working in the biotechnology department at the [[University of the Free State]] in South Africa. The technique was adapted from Nano Scanning Auger Microscopy (NanoSAM), a technique used by physical scientists to study the surface structures of metal and inanimate materials such as semiconductors. Originally designed to observe [[yeast cell]]s to find out more about how they manufactured the gas that causes bread to rise, the scientists discovered that the process could also be used in observing other living cells.&lt;ref name=Baird&gt;{{cite news|last=Baird |first=Bertram |title=Nanotechnology Reveals Secrets Of CO2 Production in Yeast Cells |url=http://ern.nrf.ac.za/control/ViewFeatureArticle?contentId=15454&amp;featureContentId=15454&amp;articleType=mainFeature |newspaper=Emerging Researchers Network |date=27 May 2013 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the technique was successfully applied to human cell tissue.&lt;ref name=EODD&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kock|first=JL|author2=Swart, CW|author3= Pohl, CH|title=The anti-mitochondrial antifungal assay for the discovery and development of new drugs|journal=[[Expert Opinion on Drug Discovery]]|date=June 2011|volume=6|issue=6|pages=671–81|pmid=22646155|doi=10.1517/17460441.2011.575358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The project was initiated at the University of the Free State by the Kock group in 1982, with the major inputs and breakthroughs occurring between 2007 and 2012. The initial aim was to explore [[lipid]] biochemical routes, which would uncover unique lipids in yeasts, and to develop new [[Chemical classification|taxonomies]] on the structures of these lipids. This unfolded into the development of the anti-mitochondrial antifungal assay (3A system), where yeast sensors are used to indicate anti-mitochondrial activity in compounds.&lt;ref name=Baird /&gt;  These compounds, aimed at selectively switching off the [[mitochondria]], therefore, might find application in combating various diseases such as [[Mycosis|fungal infections]] and cancer. Auger architectomics, which opens up individual cells to scan them, can be used to assess the effectiveness of such drugs by determining if a single cell can be "powered down" with targeted treatment.

Based on the development of the anti-mitochondrial antifungal assay system, the University of the Free State scientists felt there was a need to analyse the system in more detail. As a result, they adapted Nano Scanning Auger Microscopy, a technique used to scan the properties of metals in physics, to apply it to cells. The result was a combination of auger atom electron physics, electron microscopy, and argon etching.&lt;ref name=Baird /&gt;

The main challenge in applying the technology to biological material was to invent a sample preparation procedure that would ensure that the atom and 3D structure remained stable while argon nano-etching occurred. During the NanoSAM [[scanning electron microscope]] visualisation, an [[electron beam]] at 25[[volt|kV]] is used instead of the normal 5kV beam. [[Fixation (histology)|Sample fixation]] and dehydration methods had to be developed and optimised to fit NanoSAM without creating sample distortions. Dehydration regimes based on alcohol extraction procedures were installed and optimised, while fixation using various fixatives was included. [[Electron#Conductivity|Electron conductivity]] of samples throughout Argon etching was assured by optimised gold [[sputtering]].

== Procedure ==

Firstly, the biological sample is [[plating|plated]] with gold to stabilise the outer structure and make it electron conductive. It is then scanned in SEM mode and the surface visually enlarged. Auger atom electron physics are applied and selected areas on the sample surface are beamed with electrons. The incident beam ejects an electron in the inner [[atomic orbital|orbital]] of the atom, leaving an open space. This is filled by an electron from an outer orbital by [[relaxation (physics)|relaxation]]. Energy is released, causing the ejection of an electron from the outer orbital. This electron is called the Auger electron. The amount of energy that is released is measured by auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and used to identify the atom and its intensity. Similarly, the surface area can be screened by an electron beam eventually yielding auger electrons that are mapped, showing the distribution of atoms in different colours covering a surface area of predetermined size. The previously-screened surface of the sample is etched with argon, exposing a new surface of the sample that is then again analysed. In this way, a 3-dimensional image and element composition architecture of the whole cell is visualised.&lt;ref name=Baird /&gt;

== Discoveries ==


This process in nanotechnology led to the discovery of gas bubbles inside yeasts.&lt;ref name=FEMS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swart|first=CW|author2=Dithebe, K|author3=Pohl, CH|author4=Swart, HC|author5=Coetsee, E|author6=van Wyk, PW|author7=Swarts, JC|author8=Lodolo, EJ|author9= Kock, JL|title=Gas bubble formation in the cytoplasm of a fermenting yeast|journal=FEMS Yeast Research|date=November 2012|volume=12|issue=7|pages=867–9|pmid=23020660|doi=10.1111/j.1567-1364.12004.x|pmc=3503256}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered a [[paradigm shift]],&lt;ref name=Baird /&gt; since naked gas bubbles are not expected inside any type of cell due to structured water in the [[cytoplasm]]. This was exposed in a [[fluconazole]]-treated bubble-like sensor of the yeast ''[[Nadsonia]]''. This is the only technology known at present that can accomplish this type of nano-analysis on biological material.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== Use in medicine ==

Nanotechnology developments in medicine allow microdoses of drugs and therapies to be delivered directly to infected cells, instead of killing large groups of cells, often at the expense of healthy cells. Gold at a nano-level has the ability to bind to certain types of biological material, which means that certain types of cells can be targeted. The technique of auger architectomics may be used to map the success or otherwise of targeted drug delivery by analysing cells. The team at the University of the Free State is working with the [[Mayo Clinic]] to use the technology as a part of their cancer research.&lt;ref name=UFSRelease&gt;{{cite news|last=University of the Free State|title=Massive cancer breakthrough at UFS|url=http://www.health24.com/Medical/Cancer/News/Massive-disease-breakthrough-at-UFS-20130506|newspaper=Health24|date=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biblical minimalism''', also known as the '''Copenhagen School''' because two of its most prominent figures taught at [[Copenhagen University]], was a movement or trend in [[biblical scholarship]] that began in the 1990s with two main claims: 
# that the Bible cannot be considered reliable evidence for what had happened in ancient Israel; and  
# that "Israel" itself is a problematic subject for historical study.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qjkz_8EMoaUC&amp;pg=PA33#v=snippet&amp;q=two%20main%20claims&amp;f=false 33]}}

Minimalism was not a unified movement, but rather a label that came to be applied to several scholars at different universities who held similar views, chiefly [[Niels Peter Lemche]] and [[Thomas L. Thompson]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]], [[Philip R. Davies]], and [[Keith Whitelam]]. Minimalism gave rise to intense debate during the 1990s—the term "minimalists" was in fact a derogatory one given by its opponents, who were consequently dubbed "maximalists", but in fact neither side accepted either label. 

The so-called Maximalists, or [[Biblical archaeology school#William F. Albright and the Biblical Archaeology school|neo-Albrightians]], were composed of two quite distinct groups, the first represented by the archaeologist [[William G. Dever|William Dever]] and the influential publication ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'', the second by biblical scholar [[Iain Provan]] and Egyptologist [[Kenneth Kitchen]].{{sfn|Banks|2006|p=185}} Although these debates were in some cases heated, most scholars occupied the middle ground evaluating the arguments of both schools critically. 

Since the 1990s, while some of the minimalist arguments have been challenged or rejected, others have been refined and adopted into the mainstream of biblical scholarship.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011}}

==Background: academic study of the Bible in the 20th century==
By the opening of the 20th century the stories of the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]], [[Noah's ark]], and the [[Tower of Babel]]—in short, chapters 1 to 11 of the [[Book of Genesis]]—had become subject to greater scrutiny by scholars, and the starting point for biblical history was regarded as the stories of Abraham, Isaac, and the other [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Hebrew patriarchs]]. Then in the 1970s, largely through the publication of two books, [[Thomas L. Thompson]]'s ''[[The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives]]'' and [[John Van Seters]]' ''[[Abraham in History and Tradition]]'' it became widely accepted that the remaining chapters of Genesis were equally non-historical. At the same time, archaeology and comparative sociology convinced most scholars in the field that there was equally little historical basis to the biblical stories of [[the Exodus]] and the Israelite conquest of Canaan.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=18-20}}

By the 1980s, the Bible's stories of the Patriarchs, the Exodus from Egypt and Conquest of Canaan were no longer considered historical, but biblical histories continued to use the Bible as a primary source and to take the form of narrative records of political events arranged in chronological order, with the major role played by (largely Judean) kings and other high-status individuals. At the same time, new tools and approaches were being brought to bear on scholars' knowledge of the past of ancient Canaan, notably new archaeological methods and approaches (for example, this was the age of surface surveys, used to map population changes which are invisible in the biblical narrative), and the social sciences (an important work in this vein was Robert Coote and Keith Whitlam's ''The Emergence of Early Israel in Historical Perspective'', which used sociological data to argue, in contradiction to the biblical picture, that it was kingship that formed Israel, and not the other way round). 

Then in the 1990s a school of thought emerged from the background of the 1970s and 1980s which held that the entire enterprise of studying ancient Israel and its history was seriously flawed by an over-reliance on the biblical text, which was too problematic (meaning untrustworthy) to be used even selectively as a source for Israel's past, and that Israel itself was in any case itself a problematic subject. This movement came to be known as biblical minimalism.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=27-33}}

==Biblical minimalism==
The scholars that have come to be called "minimalists" are not a unified group, and in fact deny that they form a group or "school": Philip Davies points out that while he argues that the bulk of the Bible can be dated to the Persian period (the 5th century BCE), Niels Peter Lemche prefers the Hellenistic period (3rd to 2nd centuries BCE), while Whitelam has not given any opinion at all. Similarly, while Lemche holds that the [[Tel Dan stele]] (an inscription from the mid-9th century BCE which seems to mention the name of [[David]]) is probably a forgery, Davies and Whitelam do not. In short, the minimalists do not agree on much more than that the Bible is a doubtful source of information about ancient Israel.{{sfn|Davies|n.d.|}}

===Bible as a historical source document===
The first of the minimalists' two central claims is based on the premise that history-writing is never objective, but involves the selection of data and the construction of a narrative using preconceived ideas of the meaning of the past&amp;mdash;the fact that history is thus never neutral or objective raises questions about the accuracy of any historical account.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=33}} The minimalists cautioned that the literary form of the biblical history books is so apparent and the authors' intentions so obvious that scholars should be extremely cautious in taking them at face value. Even if the Bible does preserve some accurate information, researchers lack the means to sift that information from the inventions with which it may have been mixed.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=34-35}} 

The minimalists did not claim that the Bible is useless as a historical source; rather, they suggest that its proper use is in understanding the period in which it was written, a period which some of them place in the Persian period (5th–4th centuries BCE) and others in the Hellenistic period (3rd–2nd centuries).{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=35}}

===Historicity of the nation of Israel===
The second claim is that "Israel" itself is a difficult idea to define in terms of historiography. There is, firstly, the idealised Israel which the Bible authors created&amp;mdash;"biblical Israel". In the words of Niels Peter Lemche: 
{{quote|''The Israelite nation as explained by the biblical writers has little in the way of a historical background. It is a highly ideological construct created by ancient scholars of Jewish tradition in order to legitimize their own religious community and its religio-political claims on land and religious exclusivity.''| {{Harvnb|Lemche|1998|pp=165–66}} }}
Modern scholars have taken aspects of biblical Israel and married them with data from archaeological and non-biblical sources to create their own version of a past Israel&amp;mdash;"Ancient Israel". Neither bears much relationship to the kingdom destroyed by Assyria in about 722 BCE&amp;mdash;"historical Israel". The real subjects for history-writing in the modern period are either this historical Israel or else the biblical Israel, the first a historical reality and the second an intellectual creation of the biblical authors. Linked with this was the observation that modern biblical scholars had concentrated their attentions exclusively on [[Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], and their religious history, while ignoring the fact that these had been only a fairly insignificant part of a wider whole.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=36}}

==Important works==
*''In Search of Ancient Israel'' (Philip R. Davies, 1992){{sfn|Davies|1995|p=}}
Davies' book "popularised the scholarly conversation and crystallised the import of the emerging scholarly positions" regarding the history of Israel between the 10th and 6th centuries—in other words, it summarised current research and thinking rather than proposing anything original. It was, nevertheless, a watershed work in that it drew together the new interpretations that were emerging from archaeology: the study of texts, sociology and anthropology. Davies argued that scholars needed to distinguish between the three meanings of the word Israel: the historical ancient kingdom of that name (historical Israel); the idealised Israel of the biblical authors writing in the Persian era and seeking to unify the post-exilic Jerusalem community by creating a common past (biblical Israel); and the Israel that had been created by modern scholars over the past century or so by blending together the first two (which he termed ancient Israel, in recognition of the widespread use of this phrase in scholarly histories). "Ancient Israel", he argued, was especially problematic: biblical scholars ran the risk of placing far too much confidence in their reconstructions through relying too heavily on "biblical Israel", the Bible's highly ideological version of a society that had already ceased to exist when the bulk of the biblical books reached their final form.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=36, 291-292}}

*''The Invention of Ancient Israel'' (Keith Whitelam, 1996){{sfn|Whitelam|1996|p=}}
Subtitled "The Silencing of Palestinian History", Whitelam criticised his peers for their concentration on Israel and Judah to the exclusion of the many other peoples and kingdoms that had existed in Iron Age Palestine. Palestinian history for the period from 13th century BCE to the 2nd century CE had been ignored, and scholars had concentrated instead on political, social, and above all religious developments in the small entity of Israel. This, he argued, supported the contemporary claim to the land of Palestine by the descendants of Israel, while keeping biblical studies in the realm of religion rather than history.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=37}}

*''The Israelites in History and Tradition'' (Niels Peter Lemche, 1998){{sfn|Lemche|1998|p=}}

*''[[The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past|The Mythic Past]]'' ([[Thomas L. Thompson]], 1999){{sfn|Thompson|1999|p=}}
The subtitle of the US edition of ''[[The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past|The Mythic Past]]'' was "Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel", a phrase almost guaranteed to cause controversy in America. The European title, ''[[The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past]]'', was perhaps more descriptive of its actual theme: the need to treat the Bible as literature rather than as history—"The Bible's language is not a historical language. It is a language of high literature, of story, of sermon and of song. It is a tool of philosophy and moral instruction." This was Thompson's attempt to set the minimalist position before a wider public; it became the cause of a rejoinder by William Dever, ''[[What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?]]'', which in turn led to a bitter public dispute between the two.

==Reception and influence==
The ideas of the minimalists generated considerable controversy during the 1990s and the early part of the 21st century. Some conservative scholars reacted defensively, attempting to show that the details of the Bible were in fact consistent with having been written by contemporaries (against the minimalist claim that they were largely the work of the Persian or Hellenistic periods). A notable work in this camp was Kenneth Kitchen's ''[[On the Reliability of the Old Testament]]''. Taking a different approach, ''[[A Biblical History of Israel]]'', by [[Iain Provan]], [[V. Philips Long]], and [[Tremper Longman III]], argued that criterion of distrust set by the minimalists (the Bible should be regarded as unreliable unless directly confirmed by external sources) was unreasonable, and that it should be regarded as reliable unless directly falsified. Avi Hurvitz compared biblical Hebrew with the Hebrew from ancient inscriptions and found it consistent with the period before the Persian period, thus questioning the key minimalist contention that the biblical books were written several centuries after the events they describe.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=38}} [[Takamitsu Muraoka]] also argues against the hypothesis that the entire Hebrew Bible was composed in the Persian period, associated with some minimalists like Davies, countering that there are specifically late Biblical Hebrew features, like some rare plene spellings, that are contained in books dated to the Persian era by minimalists as well, but unusual or absent elsewhere.{{sfn|Muraoka|2006|p=9, n. 2}}

In the scholarly mainstream a growing number see significant contradictions between the Bible's version of history and reality. Some who continue to take the Bible for their framework see it as having less reliability as the level of detail increases. In consequence, the study of Israel's past has now moved beyond the minimalist/maximalist debate. Historians of ancient Israel have adapted their methodologies by relying less on the Bible and more on sociological models and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=39, 291}} Scholars such as [[Lester L. Grabbe]] (''Ancient Israel: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It?'', 2007), [[Victor H. Matthews]] (''Studying the Ancient Israelites: A Guide to Sources and Methods'', 2007), and Hans Barstad (''History and the Hebrew Bible'', 2008) simply put the evidence before the reader and explain the issues, rather than attempt to write histories; others such as K.L. Knoll (''Canaan and Israel in Antiquity'', 2001) attempt to include Israel in a broader treatment of Syria-Palestine/Canaan. This is not to say that the ideas of the minimalists are completely adopted in modern study of ancient Israel: Mario Liverani, for example (''Israel's History and the History of Israel'', 2005), accepts that the biblical sources are from the Persian period, but believes that the minimalists have not truly understood that context nor recognised the importance of the ancient sources used by the authors. Thus positions that do not fit either a minimalist or a maximalist position are now being expressed.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=39}}

[[File:Binary clock.svg|250px|thumbnail|right|A [[binary clock]] might use [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s to express binary values. In this clock, each column of LEDs shows a binary-coded decimal numeral of the traditional [[sexagesimal]] time.]]

In [[computing]] and [[electronics|electronic]] systems, '''binary-coded decimal''' ('''BCD''') is a class of [[Binary numeral system|binary]] encodings of [[decimal]] numbers where each decimal [[numerical digit|digit]] is represented by a fixed number of [[bit]]s, usually four or eight. Special bit patterns are sometimes used for a [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] or for other indications (e.g., error or overflow).

In byte-oriented systems (i.e. most modern computers), the term ''unpacked'' BCD&lt;ref name="Intel_IA32"/&gt; usually implies a full [[byte]] for each digit (often including a sign), whereas ''packed'' BCD typically encodes two decimal digits within a single byte by taking advantage of the fact that four bits are enough to represent the range 0 to 9. The precise 4-bit encoding may vary however, for technical reasons, see [[Excess-3]] for instance. The ten states representing a BCD decimal digit are sometimes called ''tetrades'' (for the [[nibble]] typically needed to hold them also known as [[tetrade (computing)|tetrade]]) with those [[don't care]]-states unused named {{Interlanguage link multi|pseudo-tetrade|de|3=Pseudotetrade|lt=''pseudo-tetrad(e)s''}}&lt;ref name="Schneider_1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tafel_1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steinbuch-Weber_1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tietze-Schenk_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kowalski_1070"/&gt; or ''pseudo-decimal digit''&lt;ref name="Ferretti_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speiser_1965"/&gt;).&lt;ref group="nb" name="Pseudo-tetrades"/&gt;

BCD's main virtue is its more accurate representation and rounding of decimal quantities as well as an ease of conversion into human-readable representations, in comparison to binary [[positional system]]s. BCD's principal drawbacks are a small increase in the complexity of the circuits needed to implement basic arithmetics and a slightly less dense storage.

BCD was used in many early [[decimal computer]]s, and is implemented in the instruction set of machines such as the [[IBM System/360]] series and its descendants, [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s [[VAX]] and the Motorola [[68000]]-series processors. Although BCD ''per se'' is not as widely used as in the past and is no longer implemented in newer computers' instruction sets (such as [[ARM architecture|ARM]]; [[x86]] does not support [[Intel BCD opcode|its BCD instruction]]s in [[long mode]] any more), decimal [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] and [[floating-point]] formats are still important and continue to be used in financial, commercial, and industrial computing, where subtle conversion and [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] [[rounding]] [[round-off error|errors]] that are inherent in floating point binary representations cannot be tolerated.&lt;ref name="Cowlishaw_GDA"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Unpacked BCD|NBCD|8-4-2-1}}Basics==
BCD takes advantage of the fact that any one decimal numeral can be represented by a four bit pattern. The most obvious way of encoding digits is "natural BCD" (NBCD), where each decimal digit is represented by its corresponding four-bit binary value, as shown in the following table. This is also called "8421" encoding.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-

Other encodings are also used, including so-called "4221" and "7421"—named after the weighting used for the bits—and "[[Excess-3]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Parag K. |author-first=Lala |title=Principles of Modern Digital Design |date=2007 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=978-0-470-07296-7 |pages=20–25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doNGOrHUyCoC&amp;lpg=PA20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the BCD digit 6, '0110'b in 8421 notation, is '1100'b in 4221 (two encodings are possible), '0110'b in 7421, and '1001'b (6+3=9) in excess-3.

As most computers deal with data in 8-bit [[byte]]s, it is possible to use one of the following methods to encode a BCD number:
* '''Unpacked''': Each numeral is encoded into one byte, with four bits representing the numeral and the remaining bits having no significance.
* '''Packed''': Two numerals are encoded into a single byte, with one numeral in the least significant [[nibble]] (bits 0 through 3) and the other numeral in the most significant nibble (bits 4 through 7).

As an example, encoding the decimal number &lt;tt&gt;'''91'''&lt;/tt&gt; using unpacked BCD results in the following binary pattern of two bytes:
  Decimal:          9          1
  Binary :  0000 1001  0000 0001

In packed BCD, the same number would fit into a single byte:
  Decimal:     9    1
  Binary :  1001 0001

Hence the numerical range for one unpacked BCD byte is zero through nine inclusive, whereas the range for one packed BCD is zero through ninety-nine inclusive.

To represent numbers larger than the range of a single byte any number of contiguous bytes may be used. For example, to represent the decimal number &lt;tt&gt;'''12345'''&lt;/tt&gt; in packed BCD, using [[big-endian]] format, a program would encode as follows:
  Decimal:          1     2    3     4    5
  Binary :  0000 0001  0010 0011  0100 0101

Note that the most significant nibble of the most significant byte is zero, implying that the number is in actuality &lt;tt&gt;'''012345'''&lt;/tt&gt;. Also note how packed BCD is more efficient in storage usage as compared to unpacked BCD; encoding the same number (with the leading zero) in unpacked format would consume twice the storage.

[[logical shift|Shifting]] and [[mask (computing)|masking]] operations are used to pack or unpack a packed BCD digit. Other [[bitwise operation|logical operation]]s are used to convert a numeral to its equivalent bit pattern or reverse the process.

==BCD in electronics==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}}{{Primary sources|section|date=January 2018}}

BCD is very common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By employing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit. This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware—a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical [[seven-segment display]]s to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary, interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, in cases where the calculations are relatively simple, working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary. Most pocket calculators do all their calculations in BCD.

The same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=University of Alicante |title=A Cordic-based Architecture for High Performance Decimal Calculations |url=http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/11826/1/VF-016519.pdf |publisher=[[IEEE]] |access-date=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Decimal CORDIC Rotation based on Selection by Rounding: Algorithm and Architecture |url=http://faculties.sbu.ac.ir/~jaberipur/Papers/Journals/19.pdf |publisher=[[British Computer Society]] |access-date=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Packed BCD==
&lt;!-- Section header used in redirects --&gt;
In '''packed BCD''' (or simply '''packed decimal'''), each of the two [[nibble]]s of each byte represent a decimal digit. Packed BCD has been in use since at least the 1960s and is implemented in all IBM mainframe hardware since then. Most implementations are [[big endian]], i.e. with the more significant digit in the upper half of each byte, and with the leftmost byte (residing at the lowest memory address) containing the most significant digits of the packed decimal value. The lower nibble of the rightmost byte is usually used as the sign flag, although some unsigned representations lack a sign flag. As an example, a 4-byte value consists of 8 nibbles, wherein the upper 7 nibbles store the digits of a 7-digit decimal value and the lowest nibble indicates the sign of the decimal integer value.

Standard sign values are 1100 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] C) for positive (+) and 1101 (D) for negative (−). This convention comes from the zone field for [[EBCDIC]] characters and the [[signed overpunch]] representation. Other allowed signs are 1010 (A) and 1110 (E) for positive and 1011 (B) for negative. IBM System/360 processors will use the 1010 (A) and 1011 (B) signs if the A bit is set in the PSW, for the ASCII-8 standard that never passed. Most implementations also provide unsigned BCD values with a sign nibble of 1111 (F).&lt;ref name="IBM_POP"&gt;{{citation |title=IBM System/370 Principles of Operation |chapter=Chapter 8: Decimal Instructions |publisher=[[IBM]] |date=March 1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DEC_PDP11"&gt;{{citation |title=PDP-11 Architecture Handbook |chapter=Chapter 3: Data Representation |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DEC_VAX11"&gt;{{citation |title=VAX-11 Architecture Handbook |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; ILE RPG uses 1111 (F) for positive and 1101 (D) for negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/iseries/v5r2/ic2924/books/c0925083170.htm |title=ILE RPG Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; These match the EBCDIC zone for digits without a sign overpunch. In packed BCD, the number 127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1100 (127C) and −127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1101 (127D). Burroughs systems used 1101 (D) for negative, and any other value is considered a positive sign value (the processors will normalize a positive sign to 1100 (C)).

No matter how many bytes wide a [[Word (data type)|word]] is, there are always an even number of nibbles because each byte has two of them. Therefore, a word of ''n'' bytes can contain up to (2''n'')−1 decimal digits, which is always an odd number of digits. A decimal number with ''d'' digits requires {{sfrac|1|2}}(''d''+1) bytes of storage space.

For example, a 4-byte (32-bit) word can hold seven decimal digits plus a sign, and can represent values ranging from ±9,999,999. Thus the number −1,234,567 is 7 digits wide and is encoded as:
 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1101
 ''1    2    3    4    5    6    7    −''

(Note that, like character strings, the first byte of the packed decimal – with the most significant two digits – is usually stored in the lowest address in memory, independent of the [[endianness]] of the machine.)

In contrast, a 4-byte binary [[two's complement]] integer can represent values from −2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.

While packed BCD does not make optimal use of storage (about one-sixth of the memory used is wasted), conversion to [[ASCII]], [[EBCDIC]], or the various encodings of [[Unicode]] is still trivial, as no arithmetic operations are required. The extra storage requirements are usually offset by the need for the accuracy and compatibility with calculator or hand calculation that fixed-point decimal arithmetic provides. Denser packings of [[BCD (character encoding)|BCD]] exist which avoid the storage penalty and also need no arithmetic operations for common conversions.

Packed BCD is supported in the [[COBOL]] programming language as the "COMPUTATIONAL-3" (an IBM extension adopted by many other compiler vendors) or "PACKED-DECIMAL" (part of the 1985 COBOL standard) data type. It is supported in [[PL/I]] as "FIXED DECIMAL". Besides the IBM System/360 and later compatible mainframes, packed BCD is implemented in the native instruction set of the original [[VAX]] processors from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] and some models of the [[SDS Sigma series]] mainframes, and is the native format for the [[Burroughs Corporation]] Medium Systems line of mainframes (descended from the 1950s [[Burroughs 205|Electrodata 200 series]]).

[[Ten's complement]] representations for negative numbers offer an alternative approach to encoding the sign of packed (and other) BCD numbers. In this case, positive numbers always have a most significant digit between 0 and 4 (inclusive), while negative numbers are represented by the 10's complement of the corresponding positive number. As a result, this system allows for, a 32-bit packed BCD numbers to range from −50,000,000 to +49,999,999, and −1 is represented as 99999999. (As with [[two's complement]] binary numbers, the range is not symmetric about zero.)

===Fixed-point packed decimal===
[[Fixed-point arithmetic|Fixed-point]] decimal numbers are supported by some programming languages (such as [[COBOL]], [[PL/I]] and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]). These languages allow the programmer to specify an implicit decimal point in front of one of the digits. For example, a packed decimal value encoded with the bytes 12 34 56 7C represents the fixed-point value +1,234.567 when the implied decimal point is located between the 4th and 5th digits:
 12 34 56 7C
 ''12 34.56 7+''

The decimal point is not actually stored in memory, as the packed BCD storage format does not provide for it. Its location is simply known to the compiler and the generated code acts accordingly for the various arithmetic operations.

===Higher-density encodings===
If a decimal digit requires four bits, then three decimal digits require 12 bits. However, since 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; (1,024) is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1,000), if three decimal digits are encoded together, only 10 bits are needed. Two such encodings are ''[[Chen–Ho encoding]]'' and ''[[densely packed decimal]]'' (DPD). The latter has the advantage that subsets of the encoding encode two digits in the optimal seven bits and one digit in four bits, as in regular BCD.

=={{anchor|Zoned BCD}}Zoned decimal==
Some implementations, for example [[IBM]] mainframe systems, support '''zoned decimal''' numeric representations. Each decimal digit is stored in one byte, with the lower four bits encoding the digit in BCD form. The upper four bits, called the "zone" bits, are usually set to a fixed value so that the byte holds a character value corresponding to the digit. EBCDIC systems use a zone value of 1111 (hex F); this yields bytes in the range F0 to F9 (hex), which are the [[EBCDIC]] codes for the characters "0" through "9". Similarly, [[ASCII]] systems use a zone value of 0011 (hex 3), giving character codes 30 to 39 (hex).

For signed zoned decimal values, the rightmost (least significant) zone nibble holds the sign digit, which is the same set of values that are used for signed packed decimal numbers (see above). Thus a zoned decimal value encoded as the hex bytes F1 F2 D3 represents the signed decimal value −123:
 F1 F2 D3
 '' 1  2 −3''

===EBCDIC zoned decimal conversion table===

===Fixed-point zoned decimal===
Some languages (such as [[COBOL]] and [[PL/I]]) directly support fixed-point zoned decimal values, assigning an implicit decimal point at some location between the decimal digits of a number. For example, given a six-byte signed zoned decimal value with an implied decimal point to the right of the fourth digit, the hex bytes F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0 represent the value +1,279.50:
 F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0
 '' 1  2  7  9. 5 +0''

==IBM and BCD==
{{Main article|BCDIC}}
[[IBM]] used the terms ''[[Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code]]'' (BCDIC, sometimes just called BCD), for 6-bit ''[[alphanumeric]]'' codes that represented numbers, upper-case letters and special characters. Some variation of BCDIC ''alphamerics'' is used in most early IBM computers, including the [[IBM 1620]], [[IBM 1400 series]], and non-[[IBM 700/7000 series#Decimal architecture (7070/7072/7074)|Decimal Architecture]] members of the [[IBM 700/7000 series]].

The [[IBM 1400 series]] are character-addressable machines, each location being six bits labeled ''B, A, 8, 4, 2'' and ''1,'' plus an odd parity check bit (''C'') and a word mark bit (''M''). For encoding digits ''1'' through ''9'', ''B'' and ''A'' are zero and the digit value represented by standard 4-bit BCD in bits ''8'' through ''1''. For most other characters bits ''B'' and ''A'' are derived simply from the "12", "11", and "0" "zone punches" in the punched card character code, and bits ''8'' through ''1'' from the ''1'' through ''9'' punches. A "12 zone" punch set both ''B'' and ''A'', an "11 zone" set ''B'', and a "0 zone" (a 0 punch combined with any others) set ''A''. Thus the letter '''A''', which is ''(12,1)'' in the punched card format, is encoded ''(B,A,1)''. The currency symbol '''$''', ''(11,8,3)'' in the punched card, was encoded in memory as ''(B,8,2,1)''. This allows the circuitry to convert between the punched card format and the internal storage format to be very simple with only a few special cases. One important special case is digit ''0'', represented by a lone ''0'' punch in the card, and ''(8,2)'' in core memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ed-thelen.org/1401Project/Van1401-CodeChart.pdf IBM BM 1401/1440/1460/1410/7010 Character Code Chart in BCD Order]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memory of the [[IBM 1620]] is organized into 6-bit addressable digits, the usual ''8, 4, 2, 1'' plus ''F'', used as a flag bit and ''C'', an odd parity check bit. BCD ''alphamerics'' are encoded using digit pairs, with the "zone" in the even-addressed digit and the "digit" in the odd-addressed digit, the "zone" being related to the ''12'', ''11'', and ''0'' "zone punches" as in the 1400 series. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.

In the Decimal Architecture [[IBM 7070]], [[IBM 7072]], and [[IBM 7074]] ''alphamerics'' are encoded using digit pairs (using [[two-out-of-five code]] in the digits, '''not''' BCD) of the 10-digit word, with the "zone" in the left digit and the "digit" in the right digit. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.

With the introduction of [[System/360]], IBM expanded 6-bit BCD ''alphamerics'' to 8-bit [[EBCDIC]], allowing the addition of many more characters (e.g., lowercase letters). A variable length Packed BCD ''numeric'' data type is also implemented, providing machine instructions that perform arithmetic directly on packed decimal data.

On the [[IBM 1130]] and [[IBM 1800|1800]], packed BCD is supported in software by IBM's Commercial Subroutine Package.

Today, BCD data is still heavily used in IBM processors and databases, such as [[IBM DB2]], mainframes, and [[Power6]]. In these products, the BCD is usually zoned BCD (as in EBCDIC or ASCII), Packed BCD (two decimal digits per [[byte]]), or "pure" BCD encoding (one decimal digit stored as BCD in the low four bits of each byte). All of these are used within hardware registers and processing units, and in software. To convert packed decimals in EBCDIC table unloads to readable numbers, you can use the OUTREC FIELDS mask of the JCL utility DFSORT.&lt;ref&gt;http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r12/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.zos.r12.iceg200%2Fenf.htm{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[VAX|VAX-11]] series includes [[Instruction set|instructions]] that can perform arithmetic directly on packed BCD data and convert between packed BCD data and other integer representations.&lt;ref name="DEC_VAX11"/&gt; The VAX's packed BCD format is compatible with that on IBM System/360 and IBM's later compatible processors. The MicroVAX and later VAX implementations dropped this ability from the CPU but retained code compatibility with earlier machines by implementing the missing instructions in an operating system-supplied software library. This is invoked automatically via exception handling when the no longer implemented instructions are encountered, so that programs using them can execute without modification on the newer machines.

The [[Intel]] [[x86]] architecture supports a [[Intel BCD opcode|unique 18-digit (ten-byte) BCD format]] that can be loaded into and stored from the floating point registers, and computations can be performed there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1: Basic Architecture|page=4-9|date=December 2016|publisher=Intel Corporation|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Motorola 68000 series]] had BCD instructions.&lt;ref name="m68k"&gt;url=http://www.tigernt.com/onlineDoc/68000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent computers such capabilities are almost always implemented in software rather than the CPU's instruction set, but BCD numeric data is still extremely common in commercial and financial applications. There are tricks for implementing packed BCD and zoned decimal add or subtract operations using short but difficult to understand sequences of word-parallel logic and binary arithmetic operations.&lt;ref name="Jones_AT"&gt;{{cite web |title=BCD Arithmetic, a tutorial |work=Arithmetic Tutorials |author-first=Douglas W. |author-last=Jones |author-link=Douglas W. Jones |publisher=The University of Iowa, Department of Computer Science |orig-year=1999 |date=2015-11-25 |location=Iowa City, Iowa, USA |url=http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/bcd/bcd.html |access-date=2016-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the following code (written in [[C (programming language)|C]]) computes an unsigned 8-digit packed BCD add using 32-bit binary operations:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
uint32_t BCDadd(uint32_t a,uint32_t b)
{
    uint32_t  t1, t2;    // unsigned 32-bit intermediate values

    t1 = a + 0x06666666;
    t2 = t1 ^ b;                   // sum without carry propagation
    t1 = t1 + b;                   // provisional sum
    t2 = t1 ^ t2;                  // all the binary carry bits
    t2 = ~t2 &amp; 0x11111110;         // just the BCD carry bits
    t2 = (t2 &gt;&gt; 2) | (t2 &gt;&gt; 3);    // correction
    return t1 - t2;                // corrected BCD sum
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Addition with BCD==
It is possible to perform [[addition]] in BCD by first adding in binary, and then converting to BCD afterwards. Conversion of the simple sum of two digits can be done by adding 6 (that is, 16 – 10) when the five-bit result of adding a pair of digits has a value greater than 9. For example:
 1001 + 1000 = 10001
    9 +    8 =    17

Note that 10001 is the binary, not decimal, representation of the desired result. Also note that it cannot fit in a 4-bit number. In BCD as in decimal, there cannot exist a value greater than 9 (1001) per digit. To correct this, 6 (0110) is added to that sum and then the result is treated as two [[nibble]]s:
 10001 + 0110 = 00010111 =&gt; 0001 0111
    17 +    6 =       23       1    7

The two nibbles of the result, 0001 and 0111, correspond to the digits "1" and "7". This yields "17" in BCD, which is the correct result.

This technique can be extended to adding multiple digits by adding in groups from right to left, propagating the second digit as a carry, always comparing the 5-bit result of each digit-pair sum to 9. Some CPUs provide a [[half-carry flag]] to facilitate BCD arithmetic adjustments following binary addition and subtraction operations.

==Subtraction with BCD==
Subtraction is done by adding the [[ten's complement]] of the [[subtrahend]]. To represent the sign of a number in BCD, the number 0000 is used to represent a [[positive number]], and 1001 is used to represent a [[negative number]]. The remaining 14 combinations are invalid signs. To illustrate signed BCD subtraction, consider the following problem: 357 − 432.

In signed BCD, 357 is 0000 0011 0101 0111. The [[ten's complement]] of 432 can be obtained by taking the [[nine's complement]] of 432, and then adding one. So, 999 − 432 = 567, and 567 + 1 = 568. By preceding 568 in BCD by the negative sign code, the number −432 can be represented. So, −432 in signed BCD is 1001 0101 0110 1000.

Now that both numbers are represented in signed BCD, they can be added together:
   0000 0011 0101 0111
      0    3    5    7
 + 1001 0101 0110 1000
 &lt;u&gt;     9    5    6    8&lt;/u&gt;
 = 1001 1000 1011 1111
      9    8   11   15

Since BCD is a form of decimal representation, several of the digit sums above are invalid. In the event that an invalid entry (any BCD digit greater than 1001) exists, 6 is added to generate a carry bit and cause the sum to become a valid entry. The reason for adding 6 is that there are 16 possible 4-bit BCD values (since 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 16), but only 10 values are valid (0000 through 1001). So adding 6 to the invalid entries results in the following:
   1001 1000 1011 1111
      9    8   11   15
 + 0000 0000 0110 0110
 &lt;u&gt;     0    0    6    6&lt;/u&gt;
 = 1001 1001 0010 0101
      9    9    2    5

Thus the result of the subtraction is 1001 1001 0010 0101 (−925). To check the answer, note that the first digit is 9, which means negative. This seems to be correct, since 357 − 432 should result in a negative number. To check the rest of the digits, represent them in decimal. 1001 0010 0101 is 925. The [[ten's complement]] of 925 is 1000 − 925 = 999 − 925 + 1 = 074 + 1 = 75, so the calculated answer is −75. To check, perform standard subtraction to verify that 357 − 432 is −75.

Note that in the event that there are a different number of nibbles being added together (such as 1053 − 122), the number with the fewest  digits must first be padded with zeros before taking the [[ten's complement]] or subtracting. So, with 1053 − 122, 122 would have to first be represented as 0122, and the [[ten's complement]] of 0122 would have to be calculated.

==Background==
The binary-coded decimal scheme described in this article is the most common encoding, but there are many others. The method here can be referred to as ''Simple Binary-Coded Decimal'' (''SBCD'') or ''BCD&amp;nbsp;8421''.
&lt;!-- It is also sometimes named ''NBCD'' (''Naturally Binary-Coded Decimal''). (where?) --&gt;
In the headers to the table, the '{{code|8 4 2 1}}', indicates the weight of each bit shown; note that in the fifth column, "BCD&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;−2&amp;nbsp;−1", two of the weights are negative. Both ASCII and EBCDIC character codes for the digits are examples of zoned BCD, and are also shown in the table.

The following table represents [[decimal]] digits from 0 to 9 in various BCD systems:

==Legal history==
In the 1972 case ''[[Gottschalk v. Benson]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision which had allowed a patent for converting BCD encoded numbers to binary on a computer. This was an important case in determining the patentability of software and algorithms.

==Comparison with pure binary==
&lt;!-- not at all clear why this needs to be here at all, shouldn't the article just describe BCD? (mfc)--&gt;
&lt;!--as an alternative number system for computing and electronics imo a comparison to the standard one is justified (plugwash)--&gt;

===Advantages===
* Many non-integral values, such as decimal 0.2, have an infinite place-value representation in binary (.001100110011...) but have a finite place-value in binary-coded decimal (0.0010). Consequently, a system based on binary-coded decimal representations of decimal fractions avoids errors representing and calculating such values.
* Scaling by a factor of 10 (or a power of 10) is simple; this is useful when a decimal scaling factor is needed to represent a non-integer quantity (e.g., in financial calculations)
* [[Rounding]] at a decimal digit boundary is simpler. Addition and subtraction in decimal does not require rounding.
* Alignment of two decimal numbers (for example 1.3 + 27.08) is a simple, exact, shift.
* Conversion to a character form or for display (e.g., to a text-based format such as [[XML]], or to drive signals for a [[seven-segment display]]) is a simple per-digit mapping, and can be done in linear ([[Big-O notation|O]](''n'')) time. Conversion from pure [[binary numeral system|binary]] involves relatively complex logic that spans digits, and for large numbers no linear-time conversion algorithm is known (see [[Binary numeral system#Conversion to and from other numeral systems|Binary numeral system]]).

===Disadvantages===
* Some operations are more complex to implement. [[Adder (electronics)|Adder]]s require extra logic to cause them to wrap and generate a carry early. 15–20 percent more circuitry is needed for BCD add compared to pure binary.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Multiplication requires the use of algorithms that are somewhat more complex than shift-mask-add (a [[Binary numeral system#Multiplication|binary multiplication]], requiring binary shifts and adds or the equivalent, per-digit or group of digits is required)
* Standard BCD requires four bits per digit, roughly 20 percent more space than a binary encoding (the ratio of 4 bits to log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;10 bits is 1.204). When packed so that three digits are encoded in ten bits, the storage overhead is greatly reduced, at the expense of an encoding that is unaligned with the 8-bit byte boundaries common on existing hardware, resulting in slower implementations on these systems.&lt;!-- Could add: encoding or decoding is trivial in software using a table lookup, and fast using direct logic otherwise. In hardware it requires no more than three gate delays. --&gt;
* Practical existing implementations of BCD are typically slower than operations on binary representations, especially on embedded systems,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} due to limited processor support for native BCD operations.

==Application==
The [[BIOS]] in many [[personal computer]]s stores the date and time in BCD because the [[MC6818]] real-time clock chip used in the original [[IBM PC AT]] motherboard provided the time encoded in BCD. This form is easily converted into ASCII for display.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.se.ecu.edu.au/units/ens1242/lectures/ens_Notes_08.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- also see MC6818 datasheet --&gt;

The [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers used BCD to implement floating-point algorithms. The [[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]] processor has a BCD mode that affects the addition and subtraction instructions. The [[Psion Organiser|Psion Organiser 1]] handheld computer’s manufacturer-supplied software also used entirely BCD to implement floating point; later Psion models used binary exclusively.

Early models of the [[PlayStation 3]] store the date and time in BCD. This led to a worldwide outage of the console on 1 March 2010. The last two digits of the year stored as BCD [[time formatting and storage bugs|were misinterpreted]] as 16 causing an error in the unit's date, rendering most functions inoperable. This has been referred to as the [[Year 2000 problem#Year 2010 problem|Year 2010 Problem]].

==Representational variations==
Various BCD implementations exist that employ other representations for numbers. [[Programmable calculator]]s manufactured by [[Texas Instruments]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], and others typically employ a [[floating-point]] BCD format, typically with two or three digits for the (decimal) exponent. The extra bits of the sign digit may be used to indicate special numeric values, such as [[infinity]], [[arithmetic underflow|underflow]]/[[arithmetic overflow|overflow]], and [[Defined and undefined|error]] (a blinking display).

===Signed variations===
Signed decimal values may be represented in several ways. The [[COBOL]] programming language, for example, supports a total of five zoned decimal formats, each one encoding the numeric sign in a different way:

The mentioned 3GPP document defines '''TBCD-STRING''' with swapped nibbles in each byte. Bits, octets and digits indexed from 1, bits from the right, digits and octets from the left.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
bits 8765 of octet n encoding digit 2n

bits 4321 of octet n encoding digit 2(n-1) +1
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meaning number &lt;code&gt;1234&lt;/code&gt;, would become &lt;code&gt;21 43&lt;/code&gt; in TBCD.

==Alternative encodings==
If errors in representation and computation are more important than the speed of conversion to and from display, a scaled binary representation may be used, which stores a decimal number as a binary-encoded integer and a binary-encoded signed decimal exponent. For example, 0.2 can be represented as 2{{e|-1}}.

This representation allows rapid multiplication and division, but may require shifting by a power of 10 during addition and subtraction to align the decimal points. It is appropriate for applications with a fixed number of decimal places that do not then require this adjustment—particularly financial applications where 2 or 4 digits after the decimal point are usually enough. Indeed, this is almost a form of [[fixed point arithmetic]] since the position of the [[radix point]] is implied.

[[Chen–Ho encoding]] provides a boolean transformation for converting groups of three BCD-encoded digits to and from 10-bit values that can be efficiently encoded in hardware with only 2 or 3 gate delays. [[Densely packed decimal]] (DPD) is a similar scheme that is used for most of the [[significand]], except the lead digit, for one of the two alternative decimal encodings specified in the [[IEEE 754-2008]] standard.

==Notes==
{{reflist|group="nb"|refs=
&lt;ref group="nb" name="Pseudo-tetrades"&gt;That is, in a standard packed 4-bit representation, there are 16 states (four bits for each digit) with 10 tetrades and 6 pseudo-tetrades, whereas in more densely packed schemes such as [[Chen–Ho encoding|Chen–Ho]] or [[densely packed decimal|DPD]] coding there are less, f.e. only 24 pseudo-tetrades in 1024 states (10 bits for three digits).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Body hair''', or '''androgenic hair''', is the [[terminal hair]] that develops on the [[human body]] during and after [[puberty]]. It is differentiated from the [[head hair]] and less visible [[vellus hair]], which are much finer and lighter in color. The growth of androgenic hair is related to the level of [[androgen]]s (often referred to as male [[hormone]]s) and the density of androgen receptors in the dermal papillae. Both must reach a threshold for the proliferation of hair follicle cells.

From childhood onward, regardless of [[sex]], vellus hair covers almost the entire area of the [[human body]]. Exceptions exclude the lips; the backs of the ears; the palms of hands; the soles of the feet; certain external [[Sex organ|genital]] areas; the [[navel]]; and [[scar]] tissue. The density of hair –&amp;nbsp;i.e. the number of [[hair follicle]]s per unit area of skin&amp;nbsp;– varies from person to person. In many cases, areas on the human body that contain vellus hair will begin to produce darker and thicker body hair, such as the first growth of [[Beard|beard hair]] on a male and female [[Adolescence|adolescent]]'s previously smooth chin; although it may appear thinner on the female.

Androgenic hair follows the same [[Human hair growth|growth pattern]] as the hair that grows on the scalp, but with a shorter [[Hair follicle#Anagen phase|anagen phase]] and longer [[Hair follicle#Telogen phase|telogen phase]].  While the anagen phase for the hair on one's head lasts for years, the androgenic hair growth phase for body hair lasts a few months. The telogen phase for body hair lasts close to a year.{{Citation needed|reason=Original source unavailabl or removed|date=May 2018}} This shortened growing period and extended dormant period explains why the hair on the head tends to be much longer than other hair found on the body.  Differences in length seen in comparing the hair on the back of the hand and pubic hair, for example, can be explained by varied growth cycles in those two regions.  The same goes for differences in body hair length seen in different people, especially when comparing [[men]] and [[women]].

==Distribution==
Like much of the hair on the human body, leg, arm, chest, and back hair begin as vellus hair.  As people age, the hair in these regions will often begin to grow darker and more abundantly.  This will typically happen during or after puberty.  Men will often have more abundant, coarser hair on the arms and back, while women tend to have a less drastic change in the hair growth in these areas but do experience a significant change in thickness of hairs.  However, some women will grow darker, longer hair in one or more of these regions.

=== Chest and abdomen ===
Vellus hair grows on the chest and abdomen of both sexes at all stages of development.  After puberty and extending into adulthood, most males grow increasing amounts of terminal hair over the chest and abdomen areas.  Adult women also typically can grow terminal hairs around the [[areola]] though in many cultures these hairs are typically removed.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
[[File:Arm hair.jpg|thumb|Arm hair]]

=== Arms ===
Arm hair grows on a human's [[forearms]], sometimes even on the elbow area. Terminal arm hair is concentrated on the wrist end of the forearm, extending over the [[hand]]. Terminal hair growth in adolescent males is often much more intense than that in females, particularly for individuals with dark hair. In some cultures, it is common for women to remove arm hair, though this practice is less frequent than that of leg hair removal.

Terminal hair growth on [[arm]]s is a secondary sexual characteristic in boys and appears in the last stages of puberty.  Vellus arm hair is usually concentrated on the elbow end of the forearm and often ends on the lower part of the [[upper arm]]. This type of intense arm vellus hair growth sometimes occurs in young women and people of both sexes until puberty. Even though this causes the arms to appear hairy, it is not caused solely by testosterone. The hair is softer and different from men's arm hair, in texture.

=== Feet ===
Visible hair appearing on the top surfaces of the feet and [[toes]] generally begins with the onset of puberty. Terminal hair growth on the feet is typically more intense in adult and adolescent males than in females.

=== Legs ===
[[File:Adolescent leg hair.jpg|thumb|Leg hair of an adolescent male]]
Leg hair sometimes appears at the onset of adulthood, with the legs of men more often hairier than those of women. For a variety of reasons, people may [[leg shaving|shave their leg hair]], including cultural practice or individual needs. Around the world, women generally shave their leg hair more regularly than men, to conform with the social norms of many cultures, many of which perceive smooth skin as a sign of youth, beauty, and in some cultures, hygiene. However, athletes of both sexes – [[Swimming (sport)|swimmers]], [[track and field|runners]], [[bicycling|cyclists]] and [[bodybuilding|bodybuilders]] in particular – may shave their androgenic hair to reduce friction, highlight muscular development or to make it easier to get into and out of skin-tight clothing.

===Pubic===
[[Pubic hair]] is a collection of coarse hair found in the pubic region. It will often also grow on the thighs and abdomen. Zoologist [[Desmond Morris]] disputes theories that it developed to signal sexual maturity or protect the skin from chafing during copulation, and prefers the explanation that pubic hair acts as a scent trap. Also, both sexes having thick pubic hairs act as a sort of cushion during intercourse.&lt;ref name="morris-bodywatching"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Desmond|title=Bodywatching: a field guide to the human species|year=1985|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[genital]] area of males and females are first inhabited by shorter, lighter vellus hairs that are next to invisible and only begin to develop into darker, thicker pubic hair at [[puberty]]. At this time, the [[pituitary gland]] secretes [[gonadotropin]] hormones which trigger the production of testosterone in the testicles and ovaries, promoting pubic hair growth. The average ages pubic hair begins to grow in males and females are 12 and 11, respectively. However, in some females, pubic hair has been known to start growing as early as age 7.

Just as individual people differ in scalp hair color, they can also differ in pubic hair color. Differences in thickness, growth rate, and length are also evident.

[[Islamic hygienical jurisprudence]] teaches that pubic and armpit hair must be pulled out or shaven to be considered as [[Sunnah]]. Trimming is acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=53EPNr8qeLgC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=Pubic+and+armpit+hair+must+also+be+shaven.+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ4fuB-7fLAhVQUI4KHbjtBVMQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pubic%20and%20armpit%20hair%20must%20also%20be%20shaven.%20islam&amp;f=false | title=Living in the Shade of Islam: A Comprehensive Reference of Theory and Practice | publisher=Tughra Books | date=2003 | last=Ismail |first=Buyukcelebi | pages=169 | isbn=1-932-09921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western culture, beginning in the 1980s, there has been a trend among women to remove or trim pubic hair, either partially or completely; the trend later spread to men as well. Fashions for both men and women to either shape or remove pubic hair rise and fall throughout much of history, though it is more often considered as a practice for women alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Looking Through the Bushes: The Disappearance of Pubic Hair|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roger-friedland/women-pubic-hair_b_875465.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Roger|last=Friedland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armpits===

Underarm hair normally starts to appear at the [[pubarche|beginning]] of [[puberty]], with growth usually completed by the end of the teenage years.

Today in much of the world, it is common for women to regularly [[Shaving|shave]] their underarm hair. The prevalence of this practice varies widely, though. The practice became popular for cosmetic reasons around 1915 in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], when one or more magazines showed a woman in a dress with shaved underarms. As women's armpit hair contrasts more noticeably with her other body hair than does a man's, it is a significant indicator of sexual maturity and therefore unwelcome in conventional western polite society. Regular shaving became feasible with the introduction of the [[safety razor]] at the beginning of the 20th century. While underarm shaving was quickly adopted in some [[English language|English]] speaking countries, especially in the US and [[Canada]], it did not become widespread in [[Europe]] until well after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hope|first=Christine|year=1982|title=Caucasian Female Body Hair and American Culture|journal=Journal of American Culture|volume=5|issue=1|pages=93–99|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.1982.0501_93.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/625/who-decided-women-should-shave-their-legs-and-underarms |title=Who decided women should shave their legs and underarms? |last1=Adams |first1=Cecil |date=1991-02-06 |website=[[The Straight Dope]] |accessdate=2015-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the practice has spread worldwide. Some men also choose to shave their armpits.

===Facial===

[[Facial hair]], as the name suggests, grows primarily on or around one's [[face]]. Both men and women experience facial hair growth. Like pubic hair, non-vellus facial hair will begin to grow in around puberty. [[Moustache]]s in young men usually begin to grow in at around the age of puberty, although some men may not grow a moustache until they reach late teens or at all. For some cases facial hair development may take longer to mature than in the late teens but a lot of men experience no facial development even at an older age. Facial hair development has often been associated with stress levels.

It is common for many women to develop a few facial hairs under or around the chin, along the sides of the face (in the area of sideburns), or on the upper lip. These may appear at any age after puberty but are often seen in women after [[menopause]] due to decreased levels of estrogen. A darkening of the vellus hair of the upper lip in women is not considered true facial hair, though it is often referred to as a "moustache"; the appearance of these dark vellus hairs may be lessened by bleaching. A relatively small number of women are able to grow enough facial hair to have a distinct beard. In some cases, female beard growth is the result of a hormonal imbalance (usually [[androgen]] excess), or a rare genetic disorder known as [[hypertrichosis]].&lt;ref name="congenitallanuginosa"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1072987-overview |title= Congenital Hypertrichosis Lanuginosa|last1= Taylor|first1= Sarah K |date= June 18, 2009 |work= Emedicine|publisher= Medscape |accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is caused by use of [[anabolic steroid]]s. Cultural pressure leads most women to remove facial hair, as it may be viewed as a [[social stigma]].

== Development==
{{Main|Human hair growth}}

Hair follicles are to varying degrees sensitive to androgen, primarily [[testosterone]] and its derivatives, particularly [[dihydrotestosterone]], with different areas on the body having different sensitivity. As androgen levels increase, the rate of hair growth and the weight of the hairs increase. Genetic factors determine both individual levels of androgen and the hair follicle's sensitivity to androgen, as well as other characteristics such as hair colour, type of hair and hair retention.

Rising levels of androgen during puberty cause vellus hair to transform into terminal hair over many areas of the body. The sequence of appearance of terminal hair reflects the level of androgen sensitivity, with [[pubic hair]] being the first to appear due to the area's special sensitivity to androgen. The appearance of pubic hair in both sexes is usually seen as an indication of the start of a person's puberty. There is a [[sexual differentiation]] in the amount and distribution of androgenic hair, with men tending to have more terminal hair in more areas. This includes [[facial hair]], [[chest hair]], [[abdominal hair]], [[leg hair]], [[arm hair]], and [[foot hair]]. Women retain more of the less visible vellus hair, although leg, arm, and foot hair can be noticeable on women.  It is not unusual for women to have a few terminal hairs around their nipples as well.
In the later decades of life, especially after the 5th decade, there begins a noticeable reduction in body hair especially in the legs.  The reason for this is not known but it could be due to poorer circulation, lower free circulating hormone amounts or other reasons.

==Function==

Androgenic hair provides tactile sensory input by transferring hair movement and vibration via the shaft to sensory nerves within the skin. Follicular nerves detect displacement of hair shafts and other nerve endings in the surrounding skin detect vibration and distortions of the skin around the follicles. Androgenic hair extends the sense of touch beyond the surface of the skin into the air and space surrounding it, detecting air movements as well as hair displacement from contact by insects or objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Controlled Stimulation of Hair Follicle Receptors |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/36/2/256.pdf |author=N. H. Sabah |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |date=1 February 1974 |volume=36 |number=2 |pages=256–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/receptor.html |title=Neuroscience for Kids – Receptors |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution ==
Determining the evolutionary function of androgenic hair must take into account both [[human evolution]] and the thermal properties of hair itself.

The thermodynamic properties of hair are based on the properties of the [[keratin]] strands and [[amino acids]] that combine into a 'coiled' structure. This structure lends to many of the properties of hair, such as its ability to stretch and return to its original length. This coiled structure does not predispose curly or frizzy hair, both of which are defined by oval or triangular hair follicle cross-sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hair-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=ROOT-HAIR-SCIENCE%5EAMAZINGLY-NATURAL%5ESHAPE-WORKSHOP&amp;cur=SHAPE-WORKSHOP |title=Hair Shape |publisher=Hair-science.com |date=1 February 2005 |accessdate=18 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222082300/http://www.hair-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=ROOT-HAIR-SCIENCE%5EAMAZINGLY-NATURAL%5ESHAPE-WORKSHOP&amp;cur=SHAPE-WORKSHOP |archivedate=22 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of less body hair===
Hair is a very good thermal conductor and aids heat transfer both into and out of the body. When [[goose bumps]] are observed, small muscles ([[Arrector pili muscle]]) contract to raise the hairs both to provide insulation, by reducing cooling by air convection of the skin, as well as in response to central nervous stimulus, similar to the feeling of 'hairs standing up on the back of your neck'. This phenomenon also occurs when static charge is built up and stored in the hair. Keratin however can easily be damaged by excessive heat and dryness, suggesting that extreme sun exposure, perhaps due to a lack of clothing, would result in perpetual hair destruction, eventually resulting in the genes being bred out in favor of high skin [[pigmentation]]. It is also true that parasites can live on and in hair thus peoples who preserved their body hair would have required greater general hygiene to prevent diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hair-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=ROOT-HAIR-SCIENCE^SO-STURDY-SO-FRAGILE^PROPERTIES-OF-HAIR^STRONG-HAIR&amp;cur=STRONG-HAIR |title=Properties Of Hair |publisher=Hair-science.com |date=1 February 2005 |accessdate=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Markus J. Rantala of the Department of Biological and Environmental Science, [[University of Jyväskylä]], [[Finland]], said humans evolved by "natural selection" to be hairless when the trade off of "having fewer parasites" became more important than having a "warming, furry coat".&lt;ref name="Rantala" /&gt;

P.E. Wheeler of the Department of Biology at [[Liverpool Polytechnic]] said [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] [[savannah]] [[mammal]]s of similar volume to humans have body hair to keep warm while only larger quadrupedal savannah mammals lack body hair, because their body volume itself is enough to keep them warm.&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt; Therefore, Wheeler said humans who should have body hair based on predictions of body volume alone for savannah mammals evolved no body hair after evolving [[bipedalism]] which he said reduced the amount of body area exposed to the sun by 40%, reducing the solar warming effect on the human body.&lt;ref name="Wheeler"&gt;Wheeler, P.E. (1985). The Loss of Functional Body Hair in Man: the Influence of Thermal Environment, Body Form and Bipedality. Journal of Human Evolution. 14, 23–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss of fur occurred at least 2 million years ago, but possibly as early as 3.3 million years ago judging from the divergence of head and pubic lice, and aided [[persistence hunting]] (the ability to catch prey in very long distance chases) in the warm savannas where hominins first evolved.  The two main advantages are felt to be bipedal locomotion and greater thermal load dissipation capacity due to better sweating and less hair.&lt;ref&gt;Kittler R, Kayser M, Stoneking M: Molecular evolution of Pediculus humanus and the origin of clothing. Curr Biol. 2003, 13: 1414-1417. 10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00507-4. Erratum: Curr Biol 2004, 14:2309.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual selection===
{{Main|sexual selection}}

Markus J. Rantala of the Department of Biological and Environmental Science, [[University of Jyväskylä]], [[Finland]], said the existence of [[androgen]] dependent hair on men could be explained by [[sexual attraction]] whereby hair on the genitals would trap [[pheromones]] and hair on the chin would make the chin appear more massive.&lt;ref name="Rantala"&gt;Rantala, M.J.

In 1876,&lt;!--The book's date is 1876.--&gt; [[Oscar Peschel]] wrote that North Asiatic Mongols, Native Americans,&lt;!--Peschel used the ambiguous term "Americans" in his listing of peoples with little to no body hair, but Peschel's usage of the term "Americans" is in reference to Native Americans. Peschel's meaning of the term "Americans" is shown in a different part of the book from the context of the first sentence of the second paragraph of page 403 when Peschel said, "Those writers who separate the Americans as a peculiar race fail to give them distinctive characters, common to them all, which distinguish them from Asiatic Mongols."--&gt; Malays, Hottentots and Bushmen have little to no body hair,&lt;!--In the second sentence of the second paragraph of page 96, Peschel said, "Its scantiness or entire absence in North Asiatic Mongols, in American and Malay families, as well as in Hottentots and Bushmen, afford some of the most persistent and best authenticated racial characters, only it must be added that the natural baldness of the body is artificially exaggerated by the careful extraction of single hairs."--&gt; while Semitics, Indo-Europeans, and Southern Europeans (especially the Portuguese and Spanish) have extensive body hair.&lt;!--In the third and fourth sentences of the first paragraph of page 97, Peschel said, "A luxuriant growth of hair on the body is one of the distinctive marks of the Semitic as well as of the Indo-European families. In Southern Europeans, especially in Portuguese and Spaniards, this character is most strongly developed."--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peschel, O. (1876). The Races of Man and Their Geographical Distribution.

According to [[Ashley Montagu]] who taught anthropology at Princeton University,  [[Asian people]] and [[black people]] such as the [[San people]]  are less hairy than [[white people]].  Montagu said that the hairless feature is a [[Neoteny|neotenous]] trait.&lt;ref name="Montagu"&gt;Montagu, Ashley. Growing Young. Published by Greenwood Publishing Group, 1989

Eike-Meinrad Winkler and Kerrin Christiansen of the Institut für Humanbiologie, [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], did a study using [[Kavango people|Kavango]] people and [[!Kung]] people of body hair and hormone levels to investigate the reason [[black Africans]] did not have bodies as hairy as [[Europeans]].&lt;ref name="Winkler" /&gt; Winkler and Christiansen concluded the difference in hairiness between black Africans and Europeans had to do with differences in [[androgen]] or [[estradiol]] production, in androgen [[metabolism]], and in [[sex hormone]] action in the target cells.&lt;ref name="Winkler"&gt;Winkler, E.-M. and Christiansen, K.

Valerie Anne Randall of the Department of Biomedical Sciences, [[University of Bradford]], said beard growth in Caucasian men increases until the mid-thirties due to a delay caused by growth cycles changing from [[vellus hair]] to [[terminal hair]].&lt;ref name="Randal" /&gt; Randall said white men and women are hairier than Japanese men and women even with the same total plasma [[androgen]] levels.&lt;ref name="Randal" /&gt; Randall says that the reason for some people being hairy and some people not being hairy is unclear, but that it probably is related to differing sensitivity of [[hair follicle]]s to [[5α-reductase]].&lt;ref name="Randal"&gt;Randall, V.

Stewart W. Hindley and Albert Damon of the Department of Anthropology at [[Stanford University]] have studied the frequency of hair on the middle finger joint (mid-[[phalanges|phalangeal]] hair) of [[Solomon Island]]ers, as a part of a series of [[anthropometric]] studies of these populations. They summarize other studies on prevalence of this trait as reporting, in general, that  [[Caucasoid]]s are more likely to have hair on the middle finger joint than [[Negroid]]s and [[Mongoloid]]s, and collect the following frequencies from previously published literature: [[Andamanese]] 0%, [[Eskimo]] 1%, African American 16% or 28%, [[Ethiopian people|Ethiopians]] 25.6%, [[Mexican people|Mexicans]] of the [[Yucatan]] 20.9%, [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]] and [[Shinnecock people|Shinnecock]] 22.7%, [[Gurkha]] 33.6%, [[Japanese people|Japanese]] 44.6%, various [[Hindu]]s 40–50%, [[Egyptian people|Egyptians]] 52.3%, [[Near Eastern]] peoples 62–71%, various Europeans 60–80%.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3837">[[File:Landscape Madagascar 04.jpg|thumb|Landscape in the Central Highlands region]]
The '''Central Highlands''', '''Central High Plateau''', or '''Hauts-Plateaux''' are a mountainous [[biogeography|biogeographical]] region in central [[Madagascar]]. They include the contiguous part of the island's interior above 800&amp;nbsp;m (2600&amp;nbsp;ft) altitude.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;871&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Highlands are separated from the [[Northern Highlands]] of the northern tip of Madagascar by a low-lying valley, the [[Mandritsara Window]], which has apparently acted as a barrier to [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] for species in the highlands, leading to [[species pair]]s such as ''[[Voalavo gymnocaudus]]'' and ''[[Voalavo antsahabensis]]'' in the Northern and Central Highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;872&lt;/ref&gt; Species restricted to the Central Highlands include the bats ''[[Miniopterus manavi]]''&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Miniopterus sororculus]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;1216&lt;/ref&gt; the rodents ''[[Brachyuromys betsileoensis]]''&lt;ref&gt;Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;949&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Voalavo antsahabensis'';&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;867&lt;/ref&gt; the tenrecs ''[[Hemicentetes nigriceps]]''&lt;ref&gt;Bronner and Jenkins, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;76&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Oryzorictes tetradactylus]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Garbutt, 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;44–45&lt;/ref&gt; and the lemur ''[[Cheirogaleus sibreei]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Garbutt, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;104&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the continuous habitat of the Central Highlands, there is little local [[endemism]], unlike the Northern Highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;395&lt;/ref&gt;

The certification is regulated by the [[Society of Broadcast Engineers]] (SBE), and demonstrates competence in the design and maintenance of AM Directional antenna facilities. The "Certified AM Directional Specialist" title is protected by [[copyright]] laws. Individuals who use the title without consent from the Society of Broadcast Engineers could face legal action.

The SBE certifications were created to recognize individuals who practice in career fields which are not regulated by state licensing or [[Professional Engineering]] programs. Marine Radio and radar systems still require a [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) license apart from an SBE certification. Broadcast Engineering is regulated at the national level and not by individual states.

'''Choice editing''' refers to the active process of controlling or limiting the choices available to consumers so as to drive to an end goal, specifically by [[ban (law)|banning things]] or imposing [[pigovian tax|punitive taxation]].  The term has gained currency in discussions about [[sustainability]].

==Definition==
The [[Sustainable Development Commission]] defined "choice editing" as "...shifting the field of choice for mainstream consumers: cutting out unnecessarily damaging products and getting real sustainable choices on the shelves."&lt;ref name=SDC2006&gt;
{{cite report
  |publisher=[[Sustainable Development Commission]]

  |title=Looking Back, Looking Forward: Lessons in Choice Editing for Sustainability
  |date=May 2006
  |page=2
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process involves "...[removing] environmentally offensive products from commercial consideration or [making] such products expensive to use."&lt;ref name=Maniates&gt;

  |first=Michael|last=Maniates
  |title=Editing out Unsustainable Behavior
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choice editing is a direct control of the impact from consumption and aims to only provide sustainable products in the market. Not only products can be edited out or replaced, but also product components, processes and business models.&lt;ref name=WBCSD&gt;
{{cite report
  |publisher=World Business Council for Sustainable Development
  |title=Sustainable consumption facts and trends: from a business perspective
  |year=2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Choice editing is nothing new. It has been around through standards, [[tax]]es, [[tariff]]s and [[subsidy|subsidies]] that made certain products more desirable for consumers than others. The Sustainable Development Roundtable in 2006 announced that in the past choice editing was a major driver of “green” innovations, which suggests its potential to increase [[sustainable consumption]].&lt;ref name=WorldWatch2010&gt;

  |year=2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actors==
Governments and policy makers can edit citizens’ choices through laws, taxes, subsidies and voluntary bans. Businesses can edit choice by removing products from their range that might have negative impact on health or environment. Additionally, they can control their value chain and together with suppliers, processors and retailers develop solutions for more sustainable products and processes. A close collaboration along the value chain is important as the product’s environmental and social performance reflects the whole life cycle assessment. 

Retailers can actively "edit out" choices by not stocking products that they, or the state, consider to have an unacceptable environmental impact, thus being unsustainable options. Moreover, retailers can edit choice by requiring their suppliers to meet certain criteria.&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Examples==
; Editing by policy makers - light bulb ban
The [[Australia]]n government phased out [[incandescent light bulb]]s by 2010 as a step towards preventing possible electricity shortages and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They were replaced by [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s (CFLs) and [[LED lamp]]s. The expected consequences are reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 4 million tons per year from 2012. The [[European Union]] is following Australia’s example by removing all incandescent bulbs by 2012. Many other countries such as [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and [[Indonesia]] will do so as well.&lt;ref name=WorldWatch2010/&gt;

; Banning a product component – Henkel
[[Henkel]] took over the [[Brazil]]ian company Alba in 2006. Some of the company’s adhesive products contained toluene, which was misused by young people for [[Inhalant abuse|glue sniffing]]. After the takeover, Henkel developed a toluene-free formula and by 2007 introduced the toluene-free brand Cascola. 

; Editing the supply chain – Adidas
[[Adidas]] supports its suppliers in order to reduce their environmental impact by developing training materials, technical guidelines and workshop tailored to each supplier’s special need. 

This way Adidas actively edits the environmental impact of its supply chain.&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt;

; Editing processes – Tijin
Tijin is a Japanese company operating in the chemical industry. They edited their business processes by developing a recycling system for polyester. This reduces energy and resource use, CO2 emission and waste. Tijin established a global network with companies that collect polyester garments for recycling and support the expansion of products containing recycled polyester.&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt;

; Editing the corporate behavior - Hipp
As assessed by Belz and Peattie (2009), Prof. Dr Claus Hipp's philosophy of appropriate corporate behavior covering market, employees, the state and nature makes his baby foods company highly coveted by consumers. The company's ethics commission believes in economic fair play that can match the consumer's willingness to pay while processing the highest quality of organic raw materials that are sustainably grown. While many manufacturing companies' sustainability goals are towards the nature and the environment, Hipp takes a long-term ambition to survive in nature, as a part of it.&lt;ref&gt;

==Controversy==
An often raised ethical question in this matter is, whether consumers should choose freely or not. Should items be simply removed from their choices? Who decides what is removed and why? Some argue that instead of choice editing, labeling should provide information about the social and environmental performance of a product. Based on that, consumers are free to choose between sustainable and unsustainable products themselves.&lt;ref name=Maniates/&gt;

The opposite opinion is held by Tim Lang, professor of food policy at [[City University London]] and a prominent figure in Britain's food industry. In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist Leo Hickman, Lang argues that the consumer need not be bothered in the supermarket aisle to agonise over complex issues such as animal welfare, carbon footprints, workers' rights and excessive packaging, often without any meaningful data on the label to inform their decision-making. Lang instead suggested that the manufacturers and retailers should take more responsibility by making most of these decisions on consumer's behalf before the product even reaches the shelves. This would in turn allow the consumer to avoid endorsing products that are damaging to the environment as well as the society.&lt;ref&gt;

Furthermore, there is still no agreement on who defines if a product is sustainable or unsustainable. Therefore, decisions made about the availability of a product can cause conflicts between the different actors like government, policy makers, businesses and consumers as they might have varying views concerning the sustainable or unsustainable nature of a product.&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt;

The '''Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) Project''' is a collaborative effort to maintain a dataset of protein-coding regions that are identically annotated on the human and mouse reference genome assemblies. The CCDS project tracks identical protein annotations on the reference mouse and human genomes with a stable identifier (CCDS ID), and ensures that they are consistently represented by the National Center for Biotechnology Information [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|(NCBI)]], [[Ensembl]], and [[UCSC Genome Browser]].&lt;ref name=pmid19498102 /&gt; The integrity of the CCDS dataset is maintained through stringent [[#Quality assurance testing|quality assurance testing]] and on-going [[#Manual curation|manual curation]].&lt;ref name=Second&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harte|first1=RA|last2=Farrell|first2=CM|last3=Loveland|first3=JE|last4=Suner|first4=MM|last5=Wilming|first5=L|last6=Aken|first6=B|last7=Barrell|first7=D|last8=Frankish|first8=A|last9=Wallin|first9=C|last10=Searle|first10=S|last11=Diekhans|first11=M|last12=Harrow|first12=J|last13=Pruitt|first13=KD|title=Tracking and coordinating an international curation effort for the CCDS project.|journal=Database |date=2012|volume=2012|pages=bas008|doi=10.1093/database/bas008|pmid=22434842|pmc=3308164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation and background==

Biological and biomedical research has come to rely on accurate and consistent annotation of genes and their products on genome assemblies.  Reference annotations of genomes are available from various sources, each with their own independent goals and policies, which results in some annotation variation.

The CCDS project was established to identify a gold standard set of protein-coding gene annotations that are identically annotated on the human and mouse [[reference genome]] assemblies by the participating annotation groups.  The CCDS gene sets that have been arrived at by consensus of the different partners &lt;ref name=Second /&gt; now consist of over 18,000 human and over 20,000 mouse genes (see [[#CCDS release history|CCDS release history]]).  The CCDS dataset is increasingly representing more [[alternative splicing]] events with each new release.&lt;ref name=third&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farrell|first1=CM|last2=O'Leary|first2=NA|last3=Harte|first3=RA|last4=Loveland|first4=JE|last5=Wilming|first5=LG|last6=Wallin|first6=C|last7=Diehans|first7=M|last8=Barrell|first8=D|last9=Searle|first9=SM|last10=Aken|first10=B|last11=Hiatt|first11=SM|last12=Frankish|first12=A|last13=Suner|first13=MM|last14=Rajput|first14=B|last15=Steward|first15=CA|last16=Brown|first16=GR|last17=Bennet|first17=R|last18=Murphy|first18=M|last19=Wu|first19=W|last20=Kay|first20=MP|last21=Hart|first21=J|last22=Rajan|first22=J|last23=Weber|first23=J|last24=Snow|first24=C|last25=Riddick|first25=LD|last26=Hunt|first26=T|last27=Webb|first27=D|last28=Thomas|first28=M|last29=Tamez|first29=P|last30=Rangwala|first30=SH|last31=McGarvey|first31=KM|last32=Pujar|first32=S|last33=Shkeda|first33=A|last34=Mudge|first34=JM|last35=Gonzale|first35=JM|last36=Gilbert|first36=JG|last37=Trevaion|first37=SJ|last38=Baetsch|first38=R|last39=Harrow|first39=JL|last40=Hubbard|first40=T|last41=Ostell|first41=JM|last42=Haussler|first42=D|last43=Pruitt|first43=KD|title=Current status and new features of the Consensus Coding Sequence database.|journal=Nucleic Acids Res.|date=2014|volume=42|pages=D865-D872|doi=10.1093/nar/gkt1059|pmid=24217909|pmc=3965069|issue=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining the CCDS gene set==

"Consensus" is defined as protein-coding regions that agree at the start codon, stop codon, and splice junctions, and for which the prediction meets quality assurance benchmarks.&lt;ref name=pmid19498102 /&gt; A combination of manual and automated genome annotations provided by [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|(NCBI)]]
and [[Ensembl]] (which incorporates manual HAVANA annotations) are compared to identify annotations with matching genomic coordinates.

==Quality assurance testing==

In order to ensure that CDSs are of high quality, multiple quality assurance (QA) tests are performed (Table 1).  All tests are performed following the annotation comparison step of each CCDS build and are independent of individual annotation group QA tests performed prior to the annotation comparison.&lt;ref name=third /&gt;

Annotations that fail QA tests undergo a round of manual checking that may improve results or reach a decision to reject annotation matches based on QA failure.

==Review process ==

The CCDS database is unique in that the review process must be carried out by multiple collaborators, and agreement must be reached before any changes can be made.  This is made possible with a collaborator coordination system that includes a work process flow and forums for analysis and discussion. The CCDS database operates an internal website that serves multiple purposes including curator communication, collaborator voting, providing special reports and tracking the status of CCDS representations.  When a collaborating CCDS group member identifies a CCDS ID that may need review, a voting process is employed to decide on the final outcome.

==Manual curation==

Coordinated manual curation is supported by a restricted-access website and a discussion e-mail list.  CCDS curation guidelines were established to address specific conflicts that were observed at a higher frequency.  Establishment of CCDS curation guidelines has helped to make the CCDS curation process more efficient by reducing the number of conflicting votes and time spent in discussion to reach a consensus agreement.  A link to the CCDS curation guidelines can be found [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS/docs/CCDS_curation_guidelines.pdf here].

Curation policies established for the CCDS data set have been integrated in to the [[RefSeq]] and HAVANA annotation guidelines and thus, new annotations provided by both groups are more likely to be concordant and result in addition of a CCDS ID.  These standards address specific problem areas, are not a comprehensive set of annotation guidelines, and do not restrict the annotation policies of any collaborating group.&lt;ref name=Second /&gt; Examples include, standardized curation guidelines for selection of the initiation codon and interpretation of upstream [[open reading frame|ORF]]s and transcripts that are predicted to be candidates for [[nonsense-mediated decay]].  Curation occurs continuously, and any of the collaborating centers can flag a CCDS ID as a potential update or withdrawal.

Conflicting opinions are addressed by consulting with scientific experts or other annotation curation groups such as the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee [[HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee|(HGNC)]] and Mouse Genome Informatics [[Mouse Genome Informatics|(MGI)]].  If a conflict cannot be resolved, then collaborators agree to withdraw the CCDS ID until more information becomes available.

==Curation challenges and annotation guidelines==

'''Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD):'''
[[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] is the most powerful [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] surveillance process. [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] eliminates defective [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] before it can be translated into protein.&lt;ref name=fourth&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberts|first1=B|last2=Johnson|first2=A|last3=Lewis|first3=J|last4=Raff|first4=M|last5=Roberts|first5=K|last6=Walter|first6=P|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell 5th edn|date=2002|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because if the defective [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] is translated, the truncated protein may cause disease. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]]; one being the [[exon junction complex]] (EJC) model.  In this model, if the stop codon is &gt;50 nt upstream of the last exon-exon junction, the transcript is assumed to be a [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] candidate.&lt;ref name=Second /&gt; The CCDS collaborators use a conservative method, based on the EJC model, to screen mRNA transcripts.  Any transcripts determined to be [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] candidates are excluded from the CCDS data set except in the following situations:&lt;ref name=Second /&gt;
# all transcripts at one particular locus are assessed to be [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] candidates however the locus is previously known to be protein coding region; 
# there is experimental evidence suggesting that a functional protein is produced from the [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] candidate transcript.

Previously, [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] candidate transcripts were considered to be protein coding transcripts by both [[RefSeq]] and HAVANA, and thereby, these [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] candidate transcripts were represented in the CCDS data set. The [[RefSeq]] group and the HAVANA project have subsequently revised their annotation policies.

'''Multiple in-frame translation start sites:'''
Multiple factors contribute to translation initiation, such as upstream [[open reading frame]]s (uORFs), secondary structure and the sequence context around the translation initiation site.  A common start site is defined within Kozak consensus sequence: (GCC) GCCACCAUGG in vertebrates.  The sequence in brackets (GCC) is the motif with unknown biological impact.&lt;ref name=seventh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kozak|first1=M|title=Pushing the limits of the scanning mechanism for initiation of translation.|journal=Gene|date=2002|volume=299|pages=1–34|doi=10.1016/S0378-1119(02)01056-9|pmid=12459250|issue=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are variations within Kozak consensus sequence, such as G or A is observed three nucleotides upstream (at position -3) of AUG. Bases between positions -3 and +4 of Kozak sequence have the most significant impact on translational efficiency. Hence, a sequence (A/G)NNAUGG is defined as a strong Kozak signal in the CCDS project.

According to the scanning mechanism, the small ribosomal subunit can initiate translation from the first reached start codon. There are exceptions to the scanning model: 
# when the initiation site is not surrounded by a strong Kozak signal, which results in leaky scanning. Thereby, the [[ribosome]] skips this AUG and initiates translation from a downstream start site; 
# when a shorter [[open reading frame|ORF]] can allow the [[ribosome]] to re-initiate translation at a downstream [[open reading frame|ORF]].&lt;ref name=seventh /&gt;

According to the CCDS annotation guidelines, the longest [[open reading frame|ORF]] must be annotated except when there is experimental evidence that an internal start site is used to initiate translation. Additionally, other types of new data, such as ribosome profiling data,&lt;ref name=Ninth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ingolia|first1=NT|last2=Brar|first2=GA|last3=Rouskin|first3=S|last4=McGeachy|first4=AM|last5=Weissman|first5=JS|title=Genome-wide Annotation and Quantitation of Translation by Ribosome Profiling.|journal=Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol.|date=2014|volume=Chapter 4|page=Unit–4.18|doi=10.1002/0471142727.mb0418s103|pmid=23821443|pmc=3775365}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to identify start codons. The CCDS data set records one translation initiation site per CCDS ID. Any alternative start sites may be used for translation and will be stated in a CCDS public note.

'''Upstream open reading frames:'''
AUG initiation codons located within transcript leaders are known as upstream AUGs (uAUGs). Sometimes, uAUGs are associated with u[[open reading frame|ORFs]] . u[[open reading frame|ORF]]s are found in approximately 50% of human and mouse transcripts.&lt;ref name=Sixth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calvo|first1=SE|last2=Pagliarni|first2=DJ|last3=Mootha|first3=VK|title=Upstream open reading frames cause widespread reduction of protein expression and are polymorphic among humans.|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|volume=106|pages=7507–12|doi=10.1073/pnas.0810916106|pmid=19372376|pmc=2669787|issue=18|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/50259/1/Calvo-2009-Upstream%20open%20readin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of u[[open reading frame|ORF]]s are another challenge for the CCDS data set. The scanning mechanism for translation initiation suggests that small ribosomal subunits (40S) bind at the 5’ end of a nascent [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] transcript and scan for the first AUG start codon.&lt;ref name=seventh /&gt; It is possible that an uAUG is recognised first, and the corresponding uORF is then translated. The translated u[[open reading frame|ORF]] could be a [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] candidate, although studies have shown that some u[[open reading frame|ORF]]s can avoid [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]]. The average size limit for u[[open reading frame|ORF]]s that will escape [[Nonsense-mediated decay|NMD]] is approximately 35 [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref name=Second /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eighth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silva|first1=AL|last2=Pereira|first2=FJC|last3=Morgado|first3=A|last4=Kong|first4=J|last5=Martins|first5=R|last6=Faustino|first6=P|last7=Liebhaber|first7=SA|last8=Romao|first8=L|title=The canonical UPF1-dependent nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is inhibited in transcripts carrying a short open reading frame independent of sequence context.|journal=RNA|date=2006|volume=12|pages=2160–70|doi=10.1261/rna.201406|pmid=17077274|pmc=1664719|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has been suggested that u[[open reading frame|ORF]]s inhibit translation of the downstream gene by trapping a [[ribosome]] initiation complex and causing the [[ribosome]] to dissociate from the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] transcript before it reaches the protein-coding regions.&lt;ref name=fourth /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sixth /&gt; Currently, no studies have reported the global impact of u[[open reading frame|ORF]]s on translational regulation.

The current CCDS annotation guidelines allow the inclusion of [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] transcripts containing u[[open reading frame|ORF]]s if they meet the following two biological requirements:&lt;ref name=Second /&gt;
# the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] transcript has a strong Kozak signal; 
# the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] transcript is either ≥ 35 [[amino acid]]s or overlaps with the primary [[open reading frame]].

'''Read-through transcripts:'''
Read-through transcripts are also known as [[conjoined gene]]s or co-transcribed genes. Read-through transcripts are defined as transcripts combining at least part of one exon from each of two or more distinct known (partner) genes which lie on the same chromosome in the same orientation.&lt;ref name = Tenth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prakash|first1=Tulika|last2=Sharma|first2=Vineet K.|last3=Adati|first3=Naoki|last4=Ozawa|first4=Ritsuko|last5=Kumar|first5=Naveen|last6=Nishida|first6=Yuichiro|last7=Fujikake|first7=Takayoshi|last8=Takeda|first8=Tadayuki|last9=Taylor|first9=Todd D.|last10=Michalak|first10=Pawel|title=Expression of Conjoined Genes: Another Mechanism for Gene Regulation in Eukaryotes|journal=PLoS ONE|date=12 October 2010|volume=5|issue=10|pages=e13284|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013284|pmid=20967262|pmc=2953495}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological function of read-through transcripts and their corresponding protein molecules remain unknown. However, the definition of a read-through gene in the CCDS data set is that the individual partner genes must be distinct, and the read-through transcripts must share ≥ 1 exon (or ≥ 2 splice sites except in the case of a shared terminal exon) with each of the distinct shorter loci.&lt;ref name=Second /&gt; Transcripts are not considered to be read-through transcripts in the following circumstances: 
# when transcripts are produced from [[overlapping genes]] but do not share same splice sites; 
# when transcripts are translated from genes that have nested structures relative to each other. In this instance, the CCDS collaborators and the [[HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee|HGNC]] have agreed that the read-through transcript be represented as a separate locus.

'''Quality of reference genome sequence:'''
As the CCDS data set is built to represent genomic annotations of human and mouse, the quality problems with the human and mouse [[reference genome]] sequences become another challenge. Quality problems occur when the reference genome is misassembled. Thereby the misassembled genome may contain premature [[stop codon]]s, [[frameshift mutation|frame-shift indels]], or likely polymorphic [[pseudogene]]s. Once these quality problems are identified, the CCDS collaborators report the issues to the Genome Reference Consortium, which investigates and makes the necessary corrections.

==Access to CCDS data==

The CCDS project is available from the NCBI CCDS data set page [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS/ (here)], which provides FTP download links and a query interface to acquire information about CCDS sequences and locations. CCDS reports can be obtained by using the query interface, which is located at the top of the CCDS data set page. Users can select various types of identifiers such as CCDS ID, gene ID, gene symbol, nucleotide ID and protein ID to search for specific CCDS information.&lt;ref name=pmid19498102 /&gt; The CCDS reports (Figure 1) are presented in a table format, providing links to specific resources, such as a history report, [[Entrez|Entrez Gene]] &lt;ref name=Eleventh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maglott|first1=D.|last2=Ostell|first2=J.|last3=Pruitt|first3=K.

The sequence identifiers table presents transcript information in [[Vertebrate and Genome Annotation Project|VEGA]], [[Ensembl]] and [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/blink.cgi?mode=query Blink]. The chromosome location table includes the genomic coordinates for each individual exon of the specific coding sequence. This table also provides links to several different genome browsers, which allow you to visualise the structure of the coding region.&lt;ref name=pmid19498102 /&gt; Exact nucleotide sequence and protein sequence of the specific coding sequence are also displayed in the section of CCDS sequence data.

==CCDS release history==

The CCDS data set size has continued to increase with both the computational genome annotation updates, which integrate new data sets submitted to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration [http://www.insdc.org/ (INSDC]), and on ongoing curation activities that supplement or improve upon that annotation. Table 2 summarises the key statistics for each CCDS build where '''Public CCDS IDs''' are all those that were not under review or pending an update or withdrawal at the time of the current release date.

==Future prospects==

Long-term goals include the addition of attributes that indicate where transcript annotation is also identical (including the [[Untranslated region|UTRs]]) and to indicate splice variants with different [[Untranslated region|UTRs]] that have the same CCDS ID.  It is also anticipated that as more complete and high-quality genome sequence data become available for other organisms, annotations from these organisms may be in scope for CCDS representation.

The CCDS set will become more complete as the independent curation groups agree on cases where they initially differ, as additional experimental validation of weakly supported genes occurs, and as automatic annotation methods continue to improve. Communication among the CCDS collaborating groups is ongoing and will resolve differences and identify refinements between CCDS update cycles.  Human updates are expected to occur roughly every 6 months and mouse releases yearly.&lt;ref name=third /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9988">The '''Creative Energy Homes'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/creative-energy-homes/index.aspx|publisher=The University of Nottingham|title=Creative Energy Homes project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (CEH) project is a showcase of innovative state-of-the-art energy-efficient homes of the future. Seven homes constructed on the [[Campuses of the University of Nottingham#University Park Campus|University Park Campus]] of the [[University of Nottingham]] are being designed and constructed to various degrees of innovation and flexibility to allow the testing of different aspects of modern methods of construction including layout and form, cladding materials, roof structures, foundations, glazing materials, thermal performance, building services systems, sustainable/[[renewable energy]] technologies, lighting systems, acoustics and water supply. The project aims to stimulate sustainable design ideas and promote new ways of providing affordable, environmentally sustainable housing that are innovative in their design. The homes are fully instrumented and occupied in order to provide comprehensive post occupancy evaluation data.

== The David Wilson House ==
[[File:CEH DavidWilsonHouse.jpg|thumb|left|The David Wilson Ecohouse]] Construction of the CEH project began in 1999 with the David Wilson Ecohouse.
This is a 4-bedroom detached property which uses brick and block construction. Its main purpose was to support research into domestic-sized renewable energy systems such as micro-CHP ([[Combined heat and power]]), [[solar thermal]], micro-wind, [[Light tube|sun pipes]], and natural ventilation devices.

The house is currently used as office space for University of Nottingham staff and continues to be used as a test bed for University research projects.

== The BASF House ==
The [http://www.house.basf.co.uk/ BASF house] was the 3rd house to be constructed and was completed in January 2008 taking only 25 weeks to build. The house was designed by Derek Trowell Architects [http://derektrowellarchitects.co.uk/basf-house/] to demonstrate that it is possible to build an affordable low energy house whilst still adherering to the [[Passivhaus]] ideology. It meets the level 4 standard of the [[Code for Sustainable Homes]].

The house has a compact floor area and relies as much as possible on passive solar design to keep costs down. The north, east and west walls are highly insulated, with the minimum number of openings compatible with acceptable day lighting standards. The southern elevation consists of a fully glazed two-layer adjustable sunspace with glazed screens that can be opened or closed to facilitate heating or cooling.

A [[Ground-coupled heat exchanger|ground-air heat exchanger]], supplied by [http://www.rehau.co.uk/ Rehau], lies to the front of the house and this consists of a network of horizontal pipes buried approximately 2m underground. At this depth the soil temperature only varies between 8-12°C throughout the year. Therefore in winter cold air can be pre-heated before being drawn into the house and in the summer the air can be cooled.

A [[rainwater harvesting]] system has also been installed, which consists of a 3500 litres tank buried under the car parking space. It collects the run-off water from the roof. This water can be used for washing clothes, watering the garden, flushing the toilet and general cleaning. Water efficiency is also an important factor of the code for sustainable homes and using a rainwater harvesting system drastically reduces the amount of mains water used per person per day.

The [[Passive solar building design|sun space]], at the front of the house captures the solar gain from the sun, heating the air for use in the rest of the house. The south facing elevation is almost 100% glazed and the north facing elevation 30% glazed, providing improved quality of life in the home by maximising the use of natural daylight and reducing the energy required to light the home.

On the roof of the house are 3 solar thermal panels used for hot water heating. This is a larger system than is typical for this size of house, which allows storage of hot water for as long as 3 days and helps compensate for extended periods of overcast conditions.

== The E.ON 2016 House ==
The [http://www.eon-uk.com/about/2016house.aspx E.ON House] is a replica 1930s UK semi-detached house built primarily to research the impact of various retrofitting solutions on the existing housing stock.

According to the [[Code for Sustainable Homes]] (CfSH) all the new houses built from 2016 are required to meet Level 6 requirements of the CfSH, or be carbon zero. However, it is estimated that by the year 2050, 25 million existing UK homes will still account for between 70 and 90 percent of the housing stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Existing Housing and Climate Change|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmcomloc/432/432i.pdf|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 25% of UK CO2 emissions derive from the domestic housing stock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Firth|first=Steven|title=Investigating CO2 emissions reduction in existing urban housing using a community domestic energy model|url=http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2009/BS09_2098_2105.pdf|work=Proceedings of the Eleventh International IBPSA Conference|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; so clearly there is a large opportunity to reduce UK carbon emissions by increasing the efficiency of existing homes.

The house is built to 1930s building regulations and the project developers had to receive special planning permission in order to construct the house. It has no roof or wall cavity insulation and uses single glazed windows. Hot water is provided by an outdated, inefficient non-condensing gas boiler and immersion heater. The plan is to bring this 1930s house to a top of the range home meeting Level 6 CfSH. It is hoped that the lessons learnt from this detailed research will help point the way to retrofitting homes to create more sustainable properties. The project consists of three phases:

# During the first phase the house was monitored in its original state. There are over 100 sensors positioned around the house monitoring temperature, relative humidity, electricity consumption of individual appliances, gas consumption, water consumption, total electricity consumption and occupancy.
# The second phase was carried out from August 2010 to June 2011. The building was upgraded with additional insulation, an improved heating system, double glazing, more efficient lighting and drought proofing. Research was carried out as to the impact of these improvements.
# In the third phase, due to begin in late 2011, further improvements will be made incorporating the installation of a conservatory-style extension creating a buffer zone between the property and the outside elements and a sun space to maximise solar gain. Renewable energy technologies, such as [[Photovoltaic panels|Solar panel]]  and solar hot water system will also be installed in order to supply the house with electricity and hot water.

== The Tarmac Homes ==
Tarmac have sponsored the construction of two semi-detached eco-homes called [http://www.tarmachomesproject.co.uk/ Tarmac House]. These are designed by [http://www.zedfactory.com/ ZEDfactory], the company responsible for the [[BEDZED]] project in south London. One home is built to Level 4 CfSH  and the other to Level 6 CfSH.

These houses demonstrate that it is possible to build a sustainable home using currently available materials and traditional methods of construction. Sustainability features of the properties include:

* Extremely well insulated walls with 250&amp;nbsp;mm of [[cavity wall insulation]].
* A [[Biomass heating system]] situated in front of the houses.
* A [[Solar water heating]] system with roof-mounted solar panels.
* [http://solarcentury.com/ Solar century] sun slates on the level 6 house helping to meet electricity demands.

== The Nottingham H.O.U.S.E (Home Optimising the Use of Solar Energy) ==
[http://www.nottinghamhouse.co.uk/ Nottingham H.O.U.S.E] is a small family "starter" home, which was built as a part of a [[Solar Decathlon Europe]] 2010 event by the students of the [http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/Departments/abe/index.aspx Department of Architecture and Built Environment]. The house delivers a zero carbon sustainable design solution that is compliant with level 6 of UK's Code for Sustainable Homes. It is a prefabricated two storey house with a courtyard garden that can be used in terrace or semi-detached form.

The House was presented at the [http://www.ecobuild.co.uk/ Ecobuild] 2010 event and awarded with the prize for the best use of timber. The models of the house were also presented at the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai Expo 2010]]. The prefabricated house is due to be moved on to the University Park campus of the University of Nottingham in the near future.

== The Mark Group House ==
The Mark Group house is currently under construction.  It is a 4-bedroom property constructed using a steel framing system with insulation cladding. Construction of the basement uses an [[Insulating concrete form|Insulating Concrete Form]] (ICF) which incorporates [[Ground granulated blast furnace slag|Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag]] (GGBS) into the [[Portland cement]].

Manufacturing Portland cement produces around 1 tonne of CO2 per tonne of concrete whereas GGBS, as a by-product of the iron industry, produces only 0.1 tonnes of CO2 per tonne{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. GGBS can be mixed with Portland cement 70%-30% to decrease its carbon footprint by around 40%{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.

{{Cyber anthropology}}
'''Cyborg anthropology''' is a discipline that studies the interaction between humanity and technology from an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] perspective. The discipline is relatively new, but offers novel insights on new technological advances and their effect on culture and society.

== History ==
[[Donna Haraway]]’s 1984 ''[[Cyborg Manifesto|"]]''[[Cyborg Manifesto|"A Cyborg Manifesto"]] was the first widely-read academic text to explore the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the cyborg.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A sub-focus group within the [[American Anthropological Association]]'s annual meeting in 1992 presented a paper entitled "Cyborg Anthropology", which cites Haraway's "Manifesto". The group described cyborg anthropology as the study of how humans define humanness in relationship to machines, as well as the study of science and technology as activities that can shape and be shaped by culture. This includes studying the ways that all people, including those who are not scientific experts, talk about and conceptualize technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Downey|first=Gary Lee|last2=Dumit|first2=Joseph|last3=Williams|first3=Sarah|year=1995|title=Cyborg Anthropology|url=|journal=Cultural Anthropology|volume=10|pages=264-269|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-group was closely related to [[science and technology studies|STS]] and the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumit, Joseph. Davis-Floyd, Robbie. Cyborg Anthropology. Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Amber Case]] has been responsible for explicating the concept of Cyborg Anthropology to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/amber-case/|title=Amber Case, Cyborg Anthropologist Information, Facts, News, Photos -- National Geographic|first=National Geographic|last=Society|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believes that a key aspect of cyborg anthropology is the study of networks of information among humans and technology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Illustrated Dictionary of Cyborg Anthropology|last=Case|first=Amber|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=978-1494773519|location=|pages=9|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many academics have helped develop cyborg anthropology, and many more who haven't heard the term still are today conducting research that may be considered cyborg anthropology, particularly research regarding technologically advanced prosthetics and how they can influence an individual's life. A 2014 summary of holistic American anthropology intersections with cyborg concepts (whether explicit or not) by Joshua Wells explained how the information-rich and culture-laden ways in which humans imagine, construct, and use tools may extend the cyborg concept through the human evolutionary lineage&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=Joshua|date=2014|title=Keep Calm and Remain Human: How We Have Always Been Cyborgs and Theories on the Technological Present of Anthropology|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00938157.2014.872460|journal=Reviews in Anthropology|volume=43|pages=5-34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Amber Case generally tells people that the actual number of self-described cyborg anthropologists is "about seven".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://caseorganic.com/2008/11/robots-robots-everywhere-a-field-guide-to-cyborg-anthropology/|title=Robots, Robots, Everywhere – A Field Guide to Cyborg Anthropology {{!}} The World is not a desktop|website=caseorganic.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://cyborganthropology.com/Main_Page The Cyborg Anthropology Wiki], overseen by Case, aims to make the discipline as accessible as possible, even to people who do not have a background in anthropology.

== Methodology ==
Cyborg anthropology uses traditional methods of anthropological research like ethnography and participant observation, accompanied by statistics, historical research, and interviews. By nature it is a multidisciplinary study; cyborg anthropology can include aspects of [[Science and Technology Studies]], [[cybernetics]], [[feminist theory]], and more.  It primarily focuses on how people use  discourse about science and technology in order to make these meaningful in their lives. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.downey.sts.vt.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1995-Cyborg-Anthropology-.pdf/|title= Cyborg Anthropology: Anthropologies of the Body {{!}} Volume 10, Number 2, May 1995 |website=downey.sts.vt.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== 'Cyborg' origins and meaning ===
Originally coined in a 1960 paper about [[space exploration]], the term is short for cybernetic organism.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.scribd.com/doc/2962194/Cyborgs-and-Space-Clynes-Kline?autodown=pdf Cyborgs and Space]," in ''Astronautics'' (September 1960), by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline.&lt;/ref&gt; A cyborg is traditionally defined as a system with both organic and inorganic parts. In the narrowest sense of the word, cyborgs are people with machinated body parts. These cyborg parts may be restorative technologies that help a body function where the organic system has failed, like [[Cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]]s, [[insulin pump]]s, and [[bionic]] limbs, or enhanced technologies that improve the human body beyond its natural state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cyborg Handbook|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=|editor-last=Gray|editor-first=Chris Hables|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the broadest sense, all human interactions with technology could qualify as a cyborg. Most cyborg anthropologists lean towards the latter view of the cyborg; some, like Amber Case, even claim that humans are already cyborgs because people's daily life and sense of self is so intertwined with technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Haraway's "Cyborg Manifesto" suggests that technology like virtual avatars, artificial insemination, sexual reassignment surgery, and artificial intelligence might make dichotomies of sex and gender irrelevant, even nonexistent. She goes on to say that other human distinctions (like life and death, human and machine, virtual and real) may similarly disappear in the wake of the cyborg.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cybercultures Reader|last=Haraway|first=Donna|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0-415-18378-2|editor-last=Bell|editor-first=David|location=|pages=291-324|chapter=A Cyborg Manifesto|quote=|editor-last2=Kennedy|editor-first2=Barbara|via=Georgetown University Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital vs. cyborg anthropology ===
{{Main|Digital anthropology}}

[[Digital anthropology]] is concerned with how digital advances are changing how people live their lives, as well as consequent changes to how anthropologists do ethnography and to a lesser extent how digital technology can be used to represent and undertake research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://savageminds.org/2012/03/22/digital-anthropology-group-is-happening-now/|title=Digital Anthropology Group Is Happening Now|last=Thompson|first=Matt|date=2012-03-22|website=Savage Minds|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyborg anthropology also looks at disciplines like [[genetics]] and nanotechnology, which are not strictly digital. Cybernetics/informatics covers the range of cyborg advances better than the label digital.

== Key concepts and research ==

=== Actor–network theory ===
{{main|Actor–network theory}}
Questions of [[subjectivity]], agency, actors, and structures have always been of interest in [[social anthropology|social]] and [[cultural anthropology]]. In cyborg anthropology the question of what type of cybernetic system constitutes an actor/subject becomes all the more important. Is it the actual technology that acts on humanity (the Internet), the general techno-culture ([[Silicon Valley]]), government sanctions ([[net neutrality]]), specific innovative humans ([[Steve Jobs]]), or some type of combination of these elements? Some academics believe that only humans have agency and technology is an object humans act upon, while others argue that humans have no agency and culture is entirely shaped by material and technological conditions. [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT), proposed by [[Bruno Latour]], is a theory that helps scholars understand how these elements work together to shape techno-cultural phenomena. Latour suggests that actors and the subjects they act on are parts of larger networks of mutual interaction and feedback loops.

=== Artificial intelligence ===
Researchers like Kathleen Richardson have conducted ethnographic research on the humans who build and interact with artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Anthropology of Robots and AI: Annihilation Anxiety and Machines|last=Richardson|first=Kathleen|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-1138831742|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Stuart Geiger, a PhD student at [[University of California, Berkeley]] suggested that robots may be capable of creating a culture of their own, which researchers could study with ethnographic methods. Anthropologists react to Geiger with skepticism because, according to Geiger, they believe that culture is specific to living creatures and ethnography limited to human subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Heather|date=2012-01-15|title=The ethnography of robots|url=http://ethnographymatters.net/blog/2012/01/15/the-ethnography-of-robots/|journal=Ethnography Matters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Posthumanism ===
The most basic definition of anthropology is the study of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/|title=American Anthropological Association|website=www.americananthro.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cyborgs, by definition, describe something that is not entirely an organic human. Moreover, limiting a discipline to the study of humans may be difficult the more that technology allows humans to transcend the normal conditions of organic life. The prospect of a [[Posthumanism|posthuman]] condition calls into question the nature and necessity of a field focused on studying humans. 

[[Sociology|Sociologist]] of technology [[Zeynep Tufekci]] argues that any symbolic expression of ourselves, even the most ancient cave painting, can be considered "posthuman" because it exists outside of our physical bodies. To her, this means that the human and the "posthuman" have always existed alongside one another, and anthropology has always concerned itself with the posthuman as well as the human.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Neil L. Whitehead and Michael Welsch point out that the concern that posthumanism will decenter the human in anthropology ignores the discipline's long history of engaging with the unhuman (like spirits and demons that humans believe in) and the culturally "subhuman" (like marginalized groups within a society).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human No More? Digital Subjectivities, Unhuman Subjects, and the End of Anthropology|last=Whitehead|first=Neil L.|last2=Wesch|first2=Michael|publisher=University Press of Colorado|year=2012|isbn=978-1-60732-170-5|location=Boulder|pages=1-21|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Contrarily, Wells, taking a deep-time perspective, points out the ways that tool-centric and technologically communicated values and ethics typify the human condition, and that cross-cultural and ethnological trends in conceptions of lifeways, power dynamics, and definitions of humanity often incorporate information-rich technological symbology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A '''deviancy amplification spiral''' (also called '''deviance amplification''') is a [[media hype]] phenomenon defined by [[media critic]]s as a cycle of increasing numbers of reports on a category of [[antisocial behaviour]] or some other 'undesirable' event, leading to a [[moral panic]].

==Origin of term==
The process of deviancy amplification was first described by Leslie T. Wilkins.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, Leslie T. (Tavistock Publications 1964) [Routledge 2001] Social Deviance: Social Policy, Action, and Research (Retrieved 26 April 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]] adopted this theory in ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics'',  and applied it to the case scenario of the "Mods and Rockers", in which he identified the concept of the deviancy amplification spiral.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Process==
According to Cohen, the spiral starts with some '[[Deviance (sociology)|deviant]]' act. Usually the deviance is [[crime|criminal]], but it can also involve lawful acts considered morally repugnant by a large segment of society. With the new focus on the issue, hidden or borderline examples that would not themselves have been newsworthy are reported, [[Confirmation bias|confirming the 'pattern]]'.

Reported cases of such 'deviance' are often presented as just 'the ones we know about' or the '[[wiktionary:tip of the iceberg|tip of the iceberg]]', an assertion that is nearly impossible to disprove immediately. For a variety of reasons, the less sensational aspects of the spiraling story that would help the public keep a rational perspective (such as statistics showing that the behavior or event is actually less common or less harmful than generally believed) tend to be ignored by the press.

As a result, minor problems begin to look serious and rare events begin to seem common. Members of the public are motivated to keep informed on these events, leading to high readership for the stories, feeding the spiral. The resulting publicity has the potential to increase the deviant behavior by glamorizing it, or by making it seem common or acceptable. In the next stage, public concern typically forces the police and the law enforcement system to focus more resources on dealing with the specific deviancy than it warrants.

Judges and magistrates then come under public pressure to deal out harsher sentences and politicians pass new laws to increase their popularity by giving the impression that they are dealing with the perceived threat. The responses by those in authority tend to reinforce the public's fear, while the media continue to report police and other law enforcement activity, amplifying the spiral.

The theory does not contend that moral panics always include the deviancy amplification spiral.

[[Eileen Barker]] asserts that the controversy surrounding certain [[new religious movements]] can turn violent in a deviancy amplification spiral.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Eileen, [http://www.fathom.com/feature/121938/ Introducing New Religious Movements] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014065725/http://www.fathom.com/feature/121938/ |date=October 14, 2007 }}, Retrieved 22 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, [[Lincoln Steffens]] details how news reporting can be used to create the impression of a [[crime|crime wave]] where there is none, in the chapter "I Make a Crime Wave".

Button and Tunley&lt;ref&gt;Button, Mark and Tunley, Martin (2015) Explaining Fraud Deviancy Attenuation in the United Kingdom. Crime, Law and Social Change, 63: 49-64 [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10611-015-9551-0]&lt;/ref&gt; have also presented a theory that offers the opposite to deviancy amplification, which they call deviancy attenuation. In this they argue using the case of fraud that there are some large problems, which those in positions of power are able to attenuate through not accurately measuring it, leading to statistics which under-estimate the problem, leading to less resources dedicated to it, re-enforcing the belief of those in power it is not a problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3711">'''The Earth Science Education Unit (ESEU)''' develops and provides continuous professional development (CPD) workshops and resources for teachers and trainee teachers in [[Earth science]] Education across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthscienceeducation.com "The Earth Science Education Unit"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ESEU was first set up in 2002 with funding from the UK Offshore Operators Association (UKOOA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oilandgasuk.co.uk/news/news.cfm/newsid/127 "Training Scheme Takes Earth-y Approach to Teaching Skills"]&lt;/ref&gt; initially providing workshops in England and Scotland for secondary teachers. In January 2003, ESEU launched workshops in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keele.ac.uk/news/week/archive/2003/0131/0131-04.htm "ESEU - Launching Into Wales"]&lt;/ref&gt;  A second lot of funding from Oil and Gas UK, the umbrella organisation for the Oil and Gas industry in the UK, through OPITO, the Oil and Gas Academy, was secured in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opito.com/uk/component/content/article/21-education-and-industry-skills/325-education-activities.html "OPITO Education activities"]&lt;/ref&gt; enabling ESEU to develop primary workshops in England and Wales at Key Stage 2 in 2009 and to launch new workshops in Scotland, written specially for the Curriculum for Excellence in 2010.

==Workshops==
ESEU provides workshops at [[Key Stage]]s 2, 3 and 4, and for the Scottish [[Curriculum for Excellence]], to teachers and to trainee teachers. Workshop fees are not paid for by the school or university but by ESEU. A team of 46 facilitators are spread across the UK and travel to schools to give workshops, taking rock samples and other equipment with them.

Practical, hands on activities are used in the workshops, which use simple, easily available and cheap materials, such as party poppers, Potty Putty and Slinky springs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/resource/steal-the-show "'Flash bang demos' steal the show"]&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as activities for use in the classroom, ESEU also encourages teachers to make the most of the outdoor environment as a teaching resource, using a gradual approach, starting by using the view from a classroom window, then the school grounds, a local graveyard or building stones in the local town and finally any local quarry or outcrop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ase.org.uk/htm/members_area/journals/ssr/ssr_march-06/putting-53-060.pdf "Putting earth science teaching into its outdoor context"]&lt;/ref&gt;

ESEU workshops were found to have a long-term impact on those involved, even though the workshops only last for 90 minutes. This may be due to the practical and interactive activities which are used as the main part of the workshops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a908529094~db=all~jumptype=rss "Can a single, short continuing professional development workshop cause change in the classroom?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resources==
ESEU also provides online resources, including a virtual rock kit, Scottish virtual activities and a rock reference sheet as well as videos of salol crystallising at different rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthscienceeducation.com/resources/index.htm "ESEU Resources"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Einstein Observatory''' ('''HEAO-2''') was the first fully imaging [[X-ray]] [[telescope]] put into space and the second of [[NASA]]'s three High Energy Astrophysical Observatories.  Named '''HEAO B''' before launch, the observatory's name was changed to honor [[Albert Einstein]] upon its successfully attaining orbit.&lt;ref name=cfa-harvard&gt;{{cite web|title=HEA Heritage Missions: Einstein Observatory|url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hea/hm/heaob.html|publisher=cfa.harvard.edu|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
The Einstein Observatory, HEAO-2, was launched on November 13, 1978, from [[Cape Canaveral, Florida]], on an Atlas-Centaur SLV-3D booster rocket into a near-circular orbit with an initial altitude slightly above 500&amp;nbsp;km. Its orbital inclination orbit was 23.5 degrees. The Einstein Observatory satellite re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and burned up on March 25, 1982.&lt;ref name=ecuip-lib&gt;{{cite web|title=Einstein Observatory (HEAO-2)|url=http://ecuip.lib.uchicago.edu/multiwavelength-astronomy/x-ray/impact/08.html|publisher=ecuip.lib.uchicago.edu|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
The Einstein Observatory carried a single large [[Wolter telescope|grazing-incidence]] focusing X-ray telescope that provided unprecedented levels of sensitivity (hundreds of times better than previously achieved) and arc-second angular resolution of point sources and extended objects. It had instruments sensitive in the 0.2 to 3.5 [[electronvolt|keV]] energy range.  A collection of four focal-plane instruments was installed in the satellite: &lt;ref name=adsabs-harvard&gt;{{cite web|title=The Einstein /HEAO 2/ X-ray Observatory|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1979ApJ...230..540G|publisher=adsabs.harvard.edu|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* HRI, or High Resolution Imaging camera, 0.15-3 keV
* IPC, or Imaging Proportional Counter, 0.4 to 4 keV
* SSS, or Solid State Spectrometer, 0.5 to 4.5 keV
* FPCS, or Bragg Focal Plane Crystal Spectrometer

There was also a coaxial instrument 'MPC', the Monitor Proportional Counter, working in the 1-20 keV range, and two filters that could be used with the imaging detectors:

* BBFS, Broad Band Filter Spectrometer (aluminium and beryllium filters than can be placed into the X-ray beam, to change the spectral sensitivity)
* OGS, Objective grating spectrometer (transmission gratings with a spectral resolution of about 50)

'''Ethical extensionism''' is an [[argument]] in [[environmental ethics]] that [[moral standing]] ought to be extended to things (animals, plants, species, the earth) that traditionally are not thought of as having moral standing.

For example, while many cultures differ as to what, exactly, is "[[murder]]", all cultures take it as wrong to commit murder. An example of ethical extensionism would be to extend to dogs or cats the status of being something that can be murdered, so that it would be wrong under some circumstances to kill a dog or cat.

On the one hand, ethical extensionism is a broadening of the class of things to which humans may owe an ethical duty.

But Des Jardins makes the point that most ethical extensionism has been merely broadening the ethical sphere incrementally, a process not agreeable to some environmental ethicists who would prefer more of a total replacement of traditional [[ethics]] with an entirely new approach. So, while ethical extensionism can, in principle, broaden the sphere of ethical standing to any arbitrary limits, the extensionist approach is seen by more recent ethical theorists as being inadequate.

The '''European Institute for Gender Equality''' is a [[Vilnius]]-based [[Agencies of the European Union|agency of the European Union]] inaugurated in 2007. It was established by [[European Union regulation|Council Regulation]] (EC) No 1922/2006 of 20 December 2006. Recruitment of its Director was advertised in April 2007.

Funded by the Commission, with a proposed budget of €52.5 million for the period 2007 to 2013, this new European Institute will support the EU institutions and the Member States in promoting equality between women and men and combating sex discrimination. The Institute will gather, analyse and disseminate reliable and comparable research data and information needed by policy-makers. It will have a documentation centre and a library which will be open to the public.

The Management Board of the institute consists of eighteen representatives of the EU Member States appointed by the Council and of one member representing the European Commission. An Experts' forum as further body of the institute consists of delegates designated by the Member States (28), the European Parliament (2) and the Commission (3), the latter including representatives from non-governmental, employers' and workers' organisations at EU level.

The '''''European Papers on the New Welfare''''' are a series of papers in English (with an Italian version) published since 2005 by [[The Risk Institute]] ([[Geneva]], [[Trieste]], [[Zagreb]]). The subtitle of the series, "The Counter-ageing Society", underlines the major goal: to promote and to publish studies, based on academic analyses and practical experiences, on issues related to the lengthening of the life cycle. This involves the understanding and monitoring of the impact of scientific advances in many fields ([[biology]], [[medicine]], [[gerontology]], [[communications]], etc.). Key is the promotion of an active life well beyond 60 years of age, and developing adequate learning and education systems as societal integration tools. All this in view of many reforms needed to develop a sustainable New Welfare (including employment, pensions schemes, health and ageing, etc.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24204">'''Extra-pair copulation''' ('''EPC''') is a [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]] [[mating]] behaviour in [[Monogamy in animals|monogamous]] species. Monogamy occurs when an individual has only one sexual partner at any one time, forming a long term bond and combining efforts to raise offspring together; extra-pair copulation occurs when one of these individuals mates outside of this pairing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrie|first=Marion|last2=Kempenaers|first2=Bart|date=1998-02-01|title=Extra-pair paternity in birds: explaining variation between species and populations|url=http://www.cell.com/article/S0169534797012329/abstract|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|language=English|volume=13|issue=2|pages=52–58|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01232-9|issn=0169-5347|pmid=21238200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the animal kingdom, extra-pair copulation is common in [[monogamous]] species, and only a very few [[Pair bond|pair-bonded]] species are thought to be exclusively sexually [[monogamous]]. EPC in the animal kingdom has mostly been studied in birds and mammals.&lt;ref name="Houtman, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gowaty and Bridges 1991a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bollinger and gavin, 1991" /&gt; Possible benefits of EPC can be investigated within non-human species, such as birds.&lt;ref name="Akçay and Roughgarden 2007" /&gt; In males, a number of theories are proposed to explain extra-pair copulations. One such hypothesis is that males maximise their [[reproductive success]] by copulating with as many females as possible outside of a pair bond relationship because their [[parental investment]] is lower, meaning they can copulate and leave the female with minimum risk to themselves. Females, on the other hand, have to invest a lot more in their offspring; extra-pair copulations produce a greater cost because they put the resources that their mate can offer at risk by copulating outside the relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite this, females do seek out extra pair copulations,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forstmeier|first=Wolfgang|last2=Martin|first2=Katrin|last3=Bolund|first3=Elisabeth|last4=Schielzeth|first4=Holger|last5=Kempenaers|first5=Bart|date=2011-06-28|title=Female extrapair mating behavior can evolve via indirect selection on males|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/26/10608|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=108|issue=26|pages=10608–10613|doi=10.1073/pnas.1103195108|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3127899|pmid=21670288}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, because of the risk, there is more debate about the evolutionary benefits for females.

==In men==
Extra-pair copulation in men has been explained as being partly due to parental investment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buss|first1=David M|title=Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures.|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=1989|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–49|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00023992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has suggested&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; that copulation poses more of a risk to future investment for women, as they have the potential of becoming pregnant, and consequently require a large parental investment of the [[gestation period]], and then further rearing of the offspring. Contrastingly, men are able to copulate and then abandon their mate as there is no risk of pregnancy for themselves, meaning there is a smaller risk of parental investment in any possible offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Trivers |first1=Robert |title=Parental investment and sexual selection |date=1996 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-35456-3 |pages=795–838 |url=http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms/classes/psy2664/Documents/trivers.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Trivers |first1=Robert |title=Parental investment and sexual selection |date=1996 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-35456-3 |pages=795–838 |url=http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms/classes/psy2664/Documents/trivers.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to having such low parental investment, it is evolutionarily adaptive for men to copulate with as many women as possible, as it will allow them to spread their genes with little risk of future investment. This may therefore lead to more extra-pair copulation in men, as they are able to copulate with other women without the consequences of having to rear new offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gangestad |first1=Steven |last2=Simpson |first2=Jeffry |title=The evolution of human mating: Trade-offs and strategic pluralism |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |date=2000 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=573–644 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0000337X |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=65461&amp;fileId=S0140525X0000337X |pmid=11301543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various factors can increase the probability of EPC in males. Firstly, males with low levels of [[fluctuating asymmetry]] are more likely to have EPCs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gangestad|first1=Steven W|last2=Thornhill|first2=Randy|title=The evolutionary psychology of extrapair sex: The role of fluctuating asymmetry|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=1997|volume=18|issue=2|pages=69–88|doi=10.1016/S1090-5138(97)00003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to the fact that signals of low fluctuating asymmetry suggest that the males have "good genes", making females more likely to copulate with them as it will enhance the genes of their offspring, even if they do not expect long term commitment from the male.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Psychosocial stress early on in life, including behaviours such as physical violence and substance abuse, can predict EPC in later life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koehler|first1=Nicole|last2=Chisholm|first2=James S|title=Early Psychosocial Stress Predicts Extra-pair Copulations|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|date=2007|volume=5|issue=1|pages=184–201|doi=10.1177/147470490700500111}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been explained as being due to Life History Theory, which argues that individuals who are reared in environments, where resources are scarce and life expectancy is low, are more likely to engage in reproductive behaviours earlier in life in order to ensure the proliferation of their genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Hillard S|last2=Gangestad|first2=Steven W|title=Life History Theory and Evolutionary Psychology.|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc (Hoboken, NJ, US)|isbn=0471264032|pages=68–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals reared in these environments are said to have short life histories. With respect to Life History Theory, these finding have been explained by suggesting that males who experienced psychosocial stress early in life have short life histories, making them more likely to try and reproduce as much as possible by engaging in EPC to avoid gene extinction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

However, men may also choose not to have EPCs for multiple reasons. One reason may be that long-term monogamous relationships can help form environments that will aid the successful rearing of offspring, as the male is present to help raise them, leading to an increased probability of the male's genes surviving to the next generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mellen|first1=Sydney|title=The Evolution of Love|date=1981|publisher=Oxford: WH Freeman|isbn=0716712717|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second reason that EPCs may be avoided by a male is that it can be costly to them; their EPC may be discovered, leading to the dissolution of the long-term relationship with their partner and, in some cases, lead to their partner assaulting or even killing them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Men may also avoid EPCs to minimize the risk of putting themselves at increased opportunity for STD transmission which can be common in EPCs. The partners in the EPC may be promiscuous as well leading to a higher statistical chance and probability of contracting venereal diseases; this would counter the lower incidence of STD transmission among exclusively monogamous sexually active couples. Spousal homicide is more likely to be committed by males rather than females, which may make the ramifications of EPC more relevant to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daly|first1=Martin|last2=Wilson|first2=Margo|title=Homicide|date=1988|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter (Hawthorne, NY, US)|isbn=0202011771|pages=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In women==
From an evolutionary perspective, females have to invest a lot more in their offspring than males due to prolonged pregnancy and child rearing, and a child has a better chance of survival and development with two parents involved in child-rearing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morell|first=Virginia|date=1998-09-25|title=A New Look at Monogamy|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/281/5385/1982|journal=Science|language=en|volume=281|issue=5385|pages=1982–1983|doi=10.1126/science.281.5385.1982|issn=0036-8075|pmid=9767050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, extra-pair copulations have a greater cost for women because they put the support and resources that their mate can offer at risk by copulating outside the relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also the increased risk of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is suggested as a possible evolutionary reason for the transition from polygamous to monogamous relationships in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauch|first=Chris T.|last2=McElreath|first2=Richard|date=2016-04-12|title=Disease dynamics and costly punishment can foster socially imposed monogamy|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160412/ncomms11219/full/ncomms11219.html|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=7|pages=11219|doi=10.1038/ncomms11219|pmid=27044573|pmc=4832056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, females do seek out extra-pair copulation, with some research finding that women's levels of [[infidelity]] are equal to that of men's, although this evidence is mixed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=David M.|last2=Shackelford|first2=Todd K.|date=1997-06-01|title=Susceptibility to Infidelity in the First Year of Marriage|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656697921759|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=31|issue=2|pages=193–221|doi=10.1006/jrpe.1997.2175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the increased risk, there is more confusion about the evolutionary benefits of extra-pair copulation for females.

The most common theory is that women mate outside of the monogamous relationship to acquire better genetic material for their offspring. A female in a relationship with a male with 'poorer genetic quality' may try to enhance the fitness of her children and therefore the continuation of her own genes by engaging in extra-pair copulation with better quality males.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A second theory is that a woman will engage in extra-pair copulation to seek additional resources for herself or her offspring.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is based on observations from the animal world in which females may copulate outside of their pair-bond relationship with neighbours to gain extra protection, food or nesting materials. Finally, [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] have theorized that extra-pair copulation is an indirect result of [[Natural selection|selection]] on males. The [[allele]]s in males that promote extra-pair copulation as an evolutionary strategy to increase [[reproductive success]] is shared between sexes leading to this behaviour being expressed in females.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are also social factors involved in extra-pair copulation. Both males and females have been found to engage in more sexual behaviour outside of the monogamous relationship when experiencing sexual dissatisfaction in the relationship,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; although how this links to evolutionary theory is unclear. Surveys have found cultural differences in attitudes towards infidelity, though it is relatively consistent that female attitudes are less favorable toward infidelity than male attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CHRISTENSEN|first=HAROLD T.|date=1973-01-01|title=Attitudes Toward Marital Infidelity: A Nine-Culture Sampling of University Student Opinion|jstor=41600842|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|volume=4|issue=2|pages=197–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When EPC occurs in animals which show sustained female-male social bonding, this can lead to extra-pair paternity (EPP), in which the female reproduces with an extra-pair male, and hence produces EPO (extra-pair offspring).&lt;ref name="Gowaty chapter"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gowaty |first1=P.A. |editor1-last=Lucas |editor1-first=Jeffrey |editor2-last=Simmons |editor2-first=Leigh |title=Essays in animal behaviour: Celebrating 50 years of animal behaviour |date=2006 |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Burlington, MA |isbn=0-12-369499-X |pages=221–254 |chapter=Beyond extra-pair paternity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the obvious reproductive success benefits for males,&lt;ref name="Gowaty chapter" /&gt; it used to be thought that males exclusively controlled EPCs.&lt;ref name="Akçay and Roughgarden 2007" /&gt;  However, it is now known that females also seek EPC in some situations.&lt;ref name="Akçay and Roughgarden 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akçay|first1=E.|last2=Roughgarden|first2=J.|title=Extra-pair paternity in birds: Review of the genetic benefits|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|date=2007|volume=9|issue=5|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/biology_papers/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds===
[[File:Taeniopygia guttata -Bird Kingdom, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada -pair-8a.jpg|thumb|Pair of zebra-finches: Bird Kingdom, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada.]]

In [[Polygyny in animals|socially polygynous]] birds, EPP is only half as common as in [[Monogamy#Varieties in biology|socially monogamous]] birds.

===In mammals===
[[File:Hylobates lar pair of white and black 02.jpg|thumb|left|Pair of white-handed gibbons]]
Additionally, EPC has been shown in [[monogamous]] [[mammals]], such as the [[white-handed gibbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Palombit |first1=Ryne A. |title=Extra-pair copulations in a monogamous ape |journal=Animal Behaviour |date=1994 |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=721–723 |doi=10.1006/anbe.1994.1097|url=http://rci.rutgers.edu/~palombit/Palombit_1994b.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of one group found 88% in-pair copulation and 12% extra-pair copulation.&lt;ref name="Reichard"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reichard |first1=U. |title=Extra-pair Copulations in a Monogamous Gibbon (Hylobates lar) |journal=Ethology |date=1995 |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=99–112 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1995.tb00319.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is much variability in rates of EPP in mammals.&lt;ref name="Cohas and Allaine 2009" /&gt; One study found that this disparity in EPP is better predicted by the differing social structures of different mammals, rather than differing types of pair bonding. For example, EPP was lower in species who live in pairs compared to those who live in solitary or family structures.&lt;ref name="Cohas and Allaine 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohas|first1=A.|last2=Allaine|first2=D.|title=Social structure influences extra-pair paternity in socially monogamous mammals|journal=Biology Letters|date=2009-03-04|volume=5|issue=3|pages=313–316|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2008.0760|pmid=19324647|pmc=2679913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for evolution===
Some argue that EPC is one way in which [[sexual selection]] is operating for [[genetics|genetic]] benefits which is why the extra-pair males involved in EPC seem to be a non-random subset.&lt;ref name="Houtman, 1992" /&gt; There is some evidence for this in birds.&lt;ref name="gray, 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=E.M.|title=Do female red-winged blackbirds benefit genetically from seeking extra-pair copulations?|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1997|volume=53|issue=3|pages=605–623|doi=10.1006/anbe.1996.0337}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[swallows]], males with longer tails are involved in EPC more than those with shorter tails.&lt;ref name="Moller, 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Møller|first1=A.P.|title=Female choice selects for male sexual tail ornaments in the monogamous swallow|journal=Nature|date=1988-04-14|volume=332|issue=6165|pages=640–642|doi=10.1038/332640a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also female swallows with a shorter-tailed within-pair mates are more likely to conduct EPC than those whose mates have longer tails.&lt;ref name="Moller, 1988" /&gt; A similar pattern has been found for [[black-capped chickadees]], in which all extra-pair males had higher rank than the within-pair males.&lt;ref name="smith, 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=S.M.|title=Extra-Pair Copulations in Black-Capped Chickadees: the Role of the Female|journal=Behaviour|date=1988-01-01|volume=107|issue=1|pages=15–23|doi=10.1163/156853988X00160}}&lt;/ref&gt; But some argue that genetic benefits for offspring is not the reason females participate in EPC.&lt;ref name="Akçay and Roughgarden 2007" /&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] of genetic benefits of EPC in 55 bird species found that extra-pair offspring were not more likely to survive than within-pair offspring. Also, extra-pair males did not show significantly better ‘good-genes’ traits than within-pair males, except for being slightly larger overall.&lt;ref name="Akçay and Roughgarden 2007" /&gt;

Another potential explanation for the occurrence of EPC in organisms where females solicit EPC is that the alleles controlling such behaviour are intersexually pleiotropic. Under the hypothesis of intersexual antagonistic pleiotropy, the benefit males get from EPC cancels out the negative effects of EPC for females. Thus, the allele that controls EPC in both organisms would persist, even if it would be detrimental to the fitness of females. Similarly, according to the hypothesis of intrasexual antagonistic pleiotropy, the allele that controls EPC in females also controls a behaviour that is under positive selection, such as receptiveness towards within-pair copulation.&lt;ref name="ForstmeierNakagawa2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forstmeier|first1=Wolfgang|last2=Nakagawa|first2=Shinichi|last3=Griffith|first3=Simon C.|last4=Kempenaers|first4=Bart|title=Female extra-pair mating: adaptation or genetic constraint?|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=29|issue=8|year=2014|pages=456–464|issn=01695347|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2014.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fesenkov Astrophysical Institute''' (Астрофизический институт имени В. Г. Фесенкова, АФИФ), or '''FAPHI''', is a research institute in [[Almaty|Almaty, Kazakhstan]]. The institute was founded in 1941 as the Institute for Astronomy and Physics of the Kazakh branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences, when a group of Soviet astronomers was evacuated during [[World War II]] from the European parts of the USSR to Almaty. In 1948 [[Gavriil Adrianovich Tikhov|G.A. Tikhov]] had organized an independent sector of [[astrobotany]], and in 1950 astronomers established the Astrophysical Institute of the Kazakh SSR. In 1989 the Institute was renamed after [[Vasily Fesenkov]], one of its founders.

FAPHI conducts both [[observation#observation in science|observational]] and theoretical research. The prime objects of observations are the [[Sun]], [[outer planets]], [[comets]], [[Herbig Ae/Be stars]], and [[active galaxy|active galaxies]]. The topics of theoretical research include [[stellar dynamics]] and [[computational astrophysics]], [[active galactic nuclei]], [[cosmology]], physics of comets and [[interstellar medium]]. The institute runs three observational bases in mountains near Almaty: [[Kamenskoe Plateau Observatory]], [[Assy-Turgen Observatory]] and [[Tien Shan Astronomical Observatory]].

FAPHI is a member of the [[International Astronomical Union]].

'''Genetic erosion''' (also known as '''genetic depletion''') is a process where the limited [[gene pool]] of an [[endangered species]] diminishes even more when reproductive individuals die off before reproducing [[Small population size|low population]]. The term is sometimes used in a narrow sense, such as when describing the loss of particular [[allele]]s or genes, as well as being used more broadly, as when referring to the loss of a phenotype or whole species.

Genetic erosion occurs because each individual organism has many unique genes which get lost when it dies without getting a chance to breed. Low genetic diversity in a population of wild animals and plants leads to a further diminishing gene pool&amp;nbsp;– inbreeding and a weakening immune system can then "fast-track" that species towards eventual [[extinction]].

By definition, endangered species suffer varying degrees of genetic erosion. Many species benefit from a human-assisted breeding program to keep their population viable,{{cn|date=December 2016}} thereby avoiding extinction over long time-frames. Small populations are more susceptible to genetic erosion than larger populations. 

Genetic erosion gets compounded and accelerated by habitat loss and [[habitat fragmentation]]&amp;nbsp;– many endangered species are threatened by habitat loss and (fragmentation) [[habitat]]. Fragmented habitat create barriers in gene flow between populations. 

The [[gene pool]] of a [[species]] or a [[population]] is the complete set of unique alleles that would be found by inspecting the genetic material of every living member of that species or population. A large gene pool indicates extensive [[genetic diversity]], which is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense [[Selection (biology)|selection]]. Meanwhile, low genetic diversity (see [[inbreeding]] and [[population bottleneck]]s) can cause reduced [[fitness (biology)|biological fitness]] and increase the chance of [[extinction]] of that species or population.

==Processes and consequences==
Population bottlenecks create shrinking gene pools, which leave fewer and fewer fertile mating partners. The genetic implications can be illustrated by considering the analogy of a high-stakes poker game with a crooked dealer. Consider that the game begins with a 52-card deck (representing high genetic diversity). Reduction of the number of breeding pairs with unique genes resembles the situation where the dealer deals only the same five cards over and over, producing only a few limited "hands".

As specimens begin to inbreed, both physical and reproductive congenital effects and defects appear more often. Abnormal sperm increases, infertility rises, and birthrates decline. "Most perilous are the effects on the immune defense systems, which become weakened and less and less able to fight off an increasing number of bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic, and other disease-producing threats. Thus, even if an endangered species in a bottleneck can withstand whatever human development may be eating away at its habitat, it still faces the threat of an epidemic that could be fatal to the entire population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://lynx.uio.no/jon/lynx/obrien-e.htm |quote=A population bottleneck creates a shrinking gene pool that leaves fewer and fewer mating partners. What are the genetic implications? The animals become part of a high stakes poker game&amp;nbsp;– with a crooked dealer. After beginning with a 52-card deck, the players wind up with, say, five cards that they are dealt over and over. As they begin to inbreed, congenital effects appear, both physical and reproductive. Often abnormal sperm increase; infertility rises; the birthrate falls. Most perilous in the long run, each animal's immune defense system is weakened. Thus, even if an endangered species in a bottleneck can withstand whatever human development may be eating away at its habitat, it still faces the threat of an epidemic that could well be fatal to the entire population. |title=GENETIC EROSION ''A Global Dilemma'' |author=Stephen J.

==Loss of agricultural and livestock biodiversity==
{{See also|Agricultural biodiversity}}
Genetic erosion in [[agricultural]] and [[livestock]] is the loss of biological genetic diversity&amp;nbsp;– including the loss of individual genes, and the loss of particular [[Genetic recombination|recombinants]] of genes (or gene complexes)&amp;nbsp;– such as those manifested in locally adapted [[landraces]] of [[domesticated]] animals or plants that have become adapted to the natural environment in which they originated.

The major driving forces behind genetic erosion in crops are variety replacement, land clearing, [[overexploitation]] of species, population pressure, [[environmental degradation]], [[overgrazing]], governmental policy, and changing agricultural systems. The main factor, however, is the replacement of local varieties of domestic plants and animals by other varieties or species that are non-local. A large number of varieties can also often be dramatically reduced when commercial varieties are introduced into traditional farming systems. Many researchers believe that the main problem related to agro-ecosystem management is the general tendency towards genetic and ecological uniformity imposed by the development of modern agriculture.

==Prevention by human intervention, modern science and safeguards==

===''In situ'' conservation===
With advances in modern bioscience, several techniques and safeguards have emerged to check the relentless advance of genetic erosion and the resulting acceleration of endangered species towards eventual extinction. However, many of these techniques and safeguards are too expensive yet to be practical, and so the best way to protect species is to protect their [[habitat]] and to let them live in it as naturally as possible.

[[Wildlife sanctuaries]] and [[national park]]s have been created to preserve entire [[ecosystem]]s with all the web of species native to the area. [[Wildlife corridor]]s are created to join fragmented habitats (see [[Habitat fragmentation]]) to enable endangered species to travel, meet, and breed with others of their kind. Scientific [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] and modern [[wildlife management]] techniques, with the expertise of scientifically trained staff, help manage these protected ecosystems and the wildlife found in them. Wild animals are also [[Species translocation|translocated]] and [[Species reintroduction|reintroduced]] to other locations physically when fragmented wildlife habitats are too far and isolated to be able to link together via a wildlife corridor, or when local extinctions have already occurred.

===''Ex situ'' conservation===
Modern policies of [[zoo associations]] and [[zoo]]s around the world have begun putting dramatically increased emphasis on keeping and breeding wild-sourced [[species]] and [[subspecies]] of animals in their registered endangered species breeding programs. These specimens are intended to have a chance to be reintroduced and survive back in the wild. The main objectives of zoos today have changed, and greater resources are being invested in breeding species and subspecies for then ultimate purpose of assisting conservation efforts in the wild. Zoos do this by maintaining extremely detailed scientific breeding records (''i.e.'' [[studbook]]s)) and by loaning their wild animals to other zoos around the country (and often globally) for breeding, to safeguard against [[inbreeding]] by attempting to maximize genetic diversity however possible.

Costly (and sometimes controversial) [[ex-situ conservation]] techniques aim to increase the genetic [[biodiversity]] on our planet, as well as the diversity in local [[gene pool]]s. by guarding against genetic erosion. Modern concepts like [[seedbank]]s, [[sperm bank]]s, and [[tissue bank]]s have become much more commonplace and valuable. [[Sperm]], [[Egg (biology)|eggs]], and [[embryos]] can now be frozen and kept in banks, which are sometimes called "Modern Noah's Arks" or "[[Frozen Zoo]]s". [[Cryopreservation]] techniques are used to freeze these living materials and keep them alive in perpetuity by storing them submerged in [[liquid nitrogen]] tanks at very low temperatures. Thus, preserved materials can then be used for [[artificial insemination]], [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]], [[embryo transfer]], and [[cloning]] methodologies to protect diversity in the gene pool of critically endangered species.

It can be possible to save an [[endangered species]] from [[extinction]] by preserving only ''parts'' of specimens, such as tissues, sperm, eggs, etc.&amp;nbsp;– even after the death of a critically endangered animal, or collected from one found freshly dead, in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]] or from the [[Wilderness|wild]]. A new specimen can then be "resurrected" with the help of cloning, so as to give it another chance to breed its genes into the living population of the respective threatened species. Resurrection of dead critically endangered wildlife specimens with the help of cloning is still being perfected, and is still too expensive to be practical, but with time and further advancements in science and methodology it may well become a routine procedure not to far into the future.

Recently, strategies for finding an integrated approach to ''in situ'' and ''ex situ'' conservation techniques have been given considerable attention, and progress is being made.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.diverseeds.eu/forum/viewforum.php?f=14 DIVERSEEDS online discussion]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} forum on the integrated approach.{{deadlink|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gifted art''' (or '''free art''') is any form or piece of art that is given freely, whether to a city, a group of people, a community or an individual. It refers to any [[art]] that is distributed at no direct cost. It is a form of [[conceptual art]]. It comes from a belief that art should be available for all people to enjoy, whether rich or poor, university graduate or junior high dropout. Since Gifted Art is an expressive form of art - an idea, it encompasses virtually all forms of art: [[movie]]s, [[literature]], [[music record]]ings, [[sculpture]],&lt;ref&gt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6DF103AF935A25751C1A96F948260&lt;/ref&gt; [[painting]],&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/7730285.stm&lt;/ref&gt; [[graffiti]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.france24.com/france24Public/en/archives/news/culture/20070512-swoon-street-art-moma-urban-new-york-paris-l-j-beaubourg.php&lt;/ref&gt; [[digital art]], [[street performance]]s, [[performance art]], [[sticker art]], [[comic]]s, coffeehouse poetry and [[Internet art|Internet]]-distributed art etc.

== Short History ==
Gifted Art has a long history in the arts. Many artists have been known to give art freely to each other, in an effort to pass along ideas, etc. [[Picasso]] and many of his contemporaries were fond of this.
[[Duchamp]] was one of the first modern day artists to Gift to the public with his piece, ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', for an art show in 1917. He gave the piece under the name of "R. Mutt," presumably to hide his identity as the artist. He actually had to pay $7 to have the piece exhibited in the show, and never intended on making any money from it. He gave it freely for all to see and to push forward the [[Dada]] movement.
In the 50's, [[Ray Johnson]] started doing [[Mail art]]. He spread the idea to many other artists&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegalleriesatmoore.org/publications/johnsoncp.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and it still occurs today. In 2002, a 6&amp;nbsp;ft X 53&amp;nbsp;ft mural by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] was installed in the Times Square Subway Station in New York City. It was gifted by the artist to all New Yorkers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/exhibitionInfo/exhibition/36702/lang/1&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent years, Gifted Art has primarily been embraced by graffiti and urban artists. Many graffiti artists consider the work they do to be art for the public. Banksy writes in his books that he believes art is more important and more enjoyable when it is out on the street where people can view it in their everyday lives than when it hangs in a museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6200">'''Human milk oligosaccharides''' (HMO, also known as human milk glycans) are sugar molecules, that are part of the oligosaccharides group and which can be found in high concentrations exclusively in [[Breast milk|human breast milk]]. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;L. Bode: ''Human milk oligosaccharides: every baby needs a sugar mama.'' In: ''Glycobiology.''

==Occurrence==
Human milk oligosaccharides form the third most abundant solid component ([[Solution|dissolved]] or [[Emulsion|emulsified]] or [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in water) of human milk after [[lactose]] and [[fat]].&lt;ref&gt;X. Chen: ''Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOS): Structure, Function, and Enzyme-Catalyzed Synthesis.'' In: ''Advances in carbohydrate chemistry and biochemistry.'' Band 72, 2015, S.&amp;nbsp;113–190, {{DOI|10.1016/bs.accb.2015.08.002}}, {{PMID|26613816}}.&lt;/ref&gt; HMOs are present in a concentration of 0.35 - 0.88 oz / L. Approximately 200 structurally different human milk oligosaccharides are known. The composition of human milk oligosaccharides in breast milk is individual to each mother and varies over the [[Breastfeeding|period of lactation]]. The dominant oligosaccharide in 80% of all women is [[2'-Fucosyllactose|2'-fucosyllactose]], which is present in human breast milk at a concentration of approximately 0.088 oz/ L.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Katja Parschat, Bettina Gutiérrez|Periodical=[[dei – die ernährungsindustrie]]|Title=Fermentativ erzeugte humane Milch-Oligosaccharide wirken präbiotisch.|At=p.&amp;nbsp;38|Date=2016-11|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
In contrast to the other components of breast milk that are absorbed by the infant through breastfeeding, HMOs are [[Digestion|indigestible]] for the newborn child. However, they have a [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] effect and serve as food for intestinal bacteria, especially [[Bifidobacterium|bifidobacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Le Doare, B. Holder, A. Bassett, P. S. Pannaraj: ''Mother's Milk: A Purposeful Contribution to the Development of the Infant Microbiota and Immunity.'' In: ''Frontiers in immunology.'' Band 9, 2018, S.&amp;nbsp;361, {{DOI|10.3389/fimmu.2018.00361}}, {{PMID|29599768}}, {{PMC|5863526}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The dominance of these intestinal bacteria in the gut reduces the colonization with [[Pathogen#Pathogenicity|pathogenic]] [[bacteria]] (probiosis) and thereby ensures a healthy [[Gut flora#Intestinal flora|intestinal flora]] (intestinal microbiome) and a reduced risk of dangerous intestinal infections.

Recent studies also suggest that HMOs significantly lower the risk of viral and bacterial [[Infection|infections]] and thus diminish the chance to get diarrhoea and respiratory diseases.

This protective function of the HMOs is activated when in contact with specific [[Pathogen|pathogens]], such as certain bacteria or [[Virus|viruses]]. These have the ability to bind themselves to the glycan [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] (receptors for long chains of connected sugar molecules on the surface of human cells) located on the surface of the intestinal cells and can thereby infect the cells of the [[Intestinal epithelium|intestinal mucosa]]. Researchers have discovered that HMOs mimic these glycan receptors so the pathogens bind themselves to the HMOs rather than the intestinal cells. This reduces the risk of an infection with a pathogen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
In addition to this, HMOs seem to influence the reaction of specific cells of the [[immune system]] in a way that reduces [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] responses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;D. S. Newburg, Y. He: ''Neonatal Gut Microbiota and Human Milk Glycans Cooperate to Attenuate Infection and Inflammation.'' In: ''Clinical obstetrics and gynecology.'' Band 58, Nummer 4, Dezember 2015, S.&amp;nbsp;814–826, {{DOI|10.1097/GRF.0000000000000156}}, {{PMID|26457857}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suspected that HMOs reduce the risk of [[Preterm birth|premature infants]] becoming infected with the potentially life-threatening disease [[necrotizing enterocolitis]] (NEC).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some of the [[Metabolite|metabolites]] directly affect the [[nervous system]] or the [[brain]] and can sometimes influence the development and behavior of children in the long term. There are studies that indicate certain HMOs supply the child with [[sialic acid]] residues. Sialic acid is an [[Nutrient#Essential nutrients|essential nutrient]] for the development of the child’s brain and mental abilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

HMOs are used as supplements in [[baby food]] to ensure a provision of babies that are not being breastfed with this important component of the human milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ralph Ammann|Periodical=European Dairy Magazine|Title=Achieving the impossible|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;30 f.|Date=2017-05|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
In experiments designed to test the suitability of HMOs as a prebiotic source of carbon for intestinal bacteria it was discovered that they are highly selective for a commensal bacteria known as ''[[Bifidobacterium longum|Bifidobacteria longum biovar infantis]]''. The presence of genes unique to ''[[Bifidobacterium longum|B. infantis]]'', including co-regulated glycosidases, and its efficiency at using HMOs as a carbon source may imply a co-evolution of HMOs and the genetic capability of select bacteria to utilize them.&lt;ref name="HMO-EVOLUTION"&gt;{{cite journal|last=German|first=JB|last2=Lebrilla|first2=CB|last3=Mills|first3=DA|date=18 Apr 2012|title=Human milk oligosaccharides: evolution, structures and bioselectivity as substrates for intestinal bacteria|journal=Nestle Nutr Workshop Ser Pediatr Program|series=Nestlé Nutrition Workshop Series: Pediatric Program|publisher=|volume=62|issue=|pages=205–22|doi=10.1159/000146322|isbn=978-3-8055-8553-8|pmc=2861563|pmid=18626202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IEC 60870 part 5''' &lt;ref name=Clarke04&gt;Gordon R. Clarke et al, ''Practical modern SCADA protocols: DNP3, 60870.5 and related systems'', Newnes, 2004 {{ISBN|0-7506-5799-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the [[IEC 60870]] set of standards which define systems used for telecontrol ([[supervisory control and data acquisition]]) in [[electrical engineering]] and [[power system automation]] applications. Part 5 provides a communication profile for sending basic telecontrol messages between two systems, which uses permanent directly connected data circuits between the systems. The [[IEC TC 57|IEC Technical Committee 57]] (Working Group 03) have developed a [[communications protocol|protocol]] standard for telecontrol, teleprotection, and associated telecommunications for [[electric power]] systems. The result of this work is IEC 60870-5. Five documents specify the base IEC 60870-5:
* IEC 60870-5-1 Transmission Frame Formats
* IEC 60870-5-2 Data Link Transmission Services
* IEC 60870-5-3 General Structure of Application Data
* IEC 60870-5-4 Definition and Coding of Information Elements
* IEC 60870-5-5 Basic Application Functions
* IEC 60870-5-6 Guidelines for conformance testing for the IEC 60870-5 companion standards
* IEC TS 60870-5-7 Security extensions to IEC 60870-5-101 and IEC 60870-5-104 protocols (applying IEC 62351)

The IEC Technical Committee 57 has also generated companion standards:
* IEC 60870-5-101 Transmission Protocols - companion standards especially for basic telecontrol tasks
* IEC 60870-5-102 Transmission Protocols - Companion standard for the transmission of integrated totals in electric power systems (this standard is not widely used)
* IEC 60870-5-103 Transmission Protocols - Companion standard for the informative interface of protection equipment
* IEC 60870-5-104 Transmission Protocols - Network access for IEC 60870-5-101 using standard transport profiles
* IEC TS 60870-5-601 Transmission protocols - Conformance test cases for the IEC 60870-5-101 companion standard
* IEC TS 60870-5-604 Conformance test cases for the IEC 60870-5-104 companion standard

IEC 60870-5-101/102/103/104 are companion standards generated for basic telecontrol tasks, transmission of integrated totals, data exchange from protection equipment &amp; network access of IEC101 respectively.

==IEC 60870-5-101==
IEC 60870-5-101 [IEC101] is a  standard for power system monitoring, control &amp; associated communications for telecontrol, teleprotection, and associated telecommunications for electric power systems.  This is completely compatible with IEC 60870-5-1 to IEC 60870-5-5 standards and uses standard asynchronous serial tele-control channel interface between [[Data terminal equipment|DTE]] and [[Data circuit-terminating equipment|DCE]]. The standard is suitable for multiple configurations like point-to-point, star, mutidropped etc.

===Features===
* Supports unbalanced (only master initiated message) &amp; balanced (can be master/slave initiated)  modes of data transfer.
* Link address and [[ASDU]] (Application Service Data Unit) addresses are provided for classifying the end station and different segments under the same.
* Data is classified into different information objects and each information object is provided with a specific address.
* Facility to classify the data into high priority (class-1) and low priority (class-2) and transfer the same using separate mechanisms.
* Possibility of classifying the data into different groups (1-16) to get the data according to the group by issuing specific group interrogation commands from the master &amp; obtaining data under all the groups by issuing a general interrogation.
* Cyclic &amp; Spontaneous data updating schemes are provided.
* Facility for time synchronization
* Schemes for transfer of files-Example:IED's will store disturbance recorder file in the memory, When electrical disturbance is occurred in the field. This file can be retrieved through IEC103 protocol for fault analysis

===Frame format===
Character format of IEC 101 uses 1 start bit, 1 stop bit, 1 parity bit &amp; 8 data bits. FT1.2 (defined in IEC 60870-5-1) is used for frame format of IEC 101 which is suitable for [[asynchronous serial communication|asynchronous]] communication with [[hamming distance]] of 4. This uses 3 types of frame formats -
''Frame with variable length ASDU'', ''Frame with fixed length'' &amp; ''single character''. Single character is used for acknowledgments, fixed length frames are used for commands &amp; variable lengths are used for sending data. The details of variable length frame is given below

==IEC 60870-5-103==
IEC 60870-5-103 [IEC103] is a standard for power system control and associated [[communication]]s. It defines a companion standard that enables interoperability between protection equipment and devices of a control system in a substation. The device complying with this standard can send the information using two methods for [[data transfer]] - either using the explicitly specified application service data units (ASDU) or using generic services for transmission of all the possible information. The standard supports some specific protection functions and provides the vendor a facility to incorporate its own protective functions on private data ranges.

===Frame format===
IEC 103 uses FT1.2 (defined in IEC 60870-5-1) for frame format having options of ''Frame with variable length'', ''Frame with fixed length'' &amp; ''single character'' similar to IEC 101. Single character is used for acknowledgments, fixed length frames are used for commands &amp; variable lengths are used for sending data. However the frame format of IEC 103 differs from IEC 101 in information object address which is split into function type (ftype) and information number (inumber) in IEC 103. Also IEC 103 can have only single information object in a frame whereas IEC 101 can have multiple information objects. Many of the field sizes are also restricted in IEC 103. The details of variable length frame is given below

==IEC 60870-5-104==
IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC 104) protocol is an extension of IEC 101 protocol with the changes in transport, network, link &amp; physical layer services to suit the complete network access. The standard uses an open [[TCP/IP]] interface to network to have connectivity to the LAN ([[Local Area Network]]) and routers with different facility ([[ISDN]], [[X.25]], [[Frame relay]] etc.) can be used to connect to the WAN ([[Wide Area Network]]). Application layer of IEC 104 is preserved same as that of IEC 101 with some of the data types and facilities not used. There are two separate link layers defined in the standard, which is suitable for data transfer over Ethernet &amp; serial line (PPP - [[Point-to-Point Protocol]]). The control field data of IEC104 contains various types of mechanisms for effective handling of network data synchronization.

The security of IEC 104, by design has been proven to be problematic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maynard|first1=Peter|last2=McLaughlin|first2=Kieran|last3=Haberler|first3=Berthold|title=Towards Understanding Man-In-The-Middle Attacks on IEC 60870-5-104 SCADA Networks|journal=2nd International Symposium for ICS &amp; SCADA Cyber Security Research 2014|date=11 September 2014|pages=30–42|doi=10.14236/ewic/ics-csr2014.5|url=http://ewic.bcs.org/content/ConWebDoc/53228|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as many of the other SCADA protocols developed around the same time.  Though the IEC technical committee (TC) 57 have published a security standard [[IEC 62351]], which implements end-to-end encryption which would prevent such attacks as replay, man-in-the-middle and packet injection. Unfortunately due to the increase in complexity vendors are reluctant to roll this out on their networks.

A '''knockout moss''' is a [[Moss|moss plant]] in which one or more specific [[gene]]s  are deleted or inactivated ("[[Gene knockout|knocked out]]") by [[gene targeting]]. After deletion of a gene, the knockout moss has lost the trait encoded by this gene. Thus, the function of this gene can be inferred. This scientific approach is called [[reverse genetics]] as the scientist wants to unravel the function of a specific gene. In [[classical genetics]] the scientist starts with a [[phenotype]] of interest and searches for the gene that causes this phenotype. Knockout mosses are relevant for [[basic research]] in [[biology]] as well as in [[biotechnology]].

==Scientific background==
The targeted deletion or alteration of genes relies on the integration of a [[DNA]] strand at a specific and predictable position into the [[genome]] of the host cell. This DNA strand must be engineered in such a way that both ends are identical to this specific [[gene locus]]. This is a prerequisite for being efficiently integrated via [[homologous recombination]] (HR). Basically, a [[knockout mouse]] is engineered in the same way.
So far, this method of gene targeting in [[land plants]] has been carried out in the mosses ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'' and ''[[Ceratodon purpureus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;F. Mittmann, S. Dienstbach, A. Weisert, C. Forreiter, 2009: Analysis of the phytochrome gene family in Ceratodon purpureus by gene targeting reveals the primary [[phytochrome]] responsible for [[phototropism]] and [[polarotropism]]. {{PMID|19330350}}. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/qv0132x17077g631/fulltext.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; since in these [[Cryptogam|non-seed]] plant [[species]] the efficiency of HR is several orders of magnitude higher than in [[seed plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reski |first1=Ralf |title=Physcomitrella and Arabidopsis: the David and Goliath of reverse genetics |journal=Trends in Plant Science |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=209–10 |year=1998 |doi=10.1016/S1360-1385(98)01257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knockout mosses are stored at and distributed by a specialized [[Biobank]], the [[International Moss Stock Center]].

==Method==
For altering moss genes in a targeted way, the DNA-construct needs to be incubated together with moss [[protoplast]]s and with [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG). As mosses are [[Haploid#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]] organisms, the regenerating moss filaments ([[protonemata]]) can be directly assayed for gene targeting within 6 weeks when utilizing [[PCR]]-methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reinhard |first1=Christina |last2=Schween |first2=Gabriele |last3=Reski |first3=Ralf |last4=Hohe |first4=Annette |last5=Egener |first5=Tanja |last6=Lucht |first6=Jan M. |last7=Holtorf |first7=Hauke |title=An improved and highly standardised transformation procedure allows efficient production of single and multiple targeted gene-knockouts in a moss, Physcomitrella patens |journal=Current Genetics |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=339–47 |year=2004 |pmid=14586556 |doi=10.1007/s00294-003-0458-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Chloroplast division===
The first scientific publication about identification of the function of a hitherto unknown gene utilizing knockout moss appeared 1998 and was authored by [[Ralf Reski]] and coworkers. They deleted the [[ftsZ]]-gene and thus functionally identified the first gene pivotal for the division of an [[organelle]] in any [[eukaryote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=44902 |last1=Strepp |first1=René |last2=Scholz |first2=Sirkka |last3=Kruse |first3=Sven |last4=Speth |first4=Volker |last5=Reski |first5=Ralf |title=Plant Nuclear Gene Knockout Reveals a Role in Plastid Division for the Homolog of the Bacterial Cell Division Protein FtsZ, an Ancestral Tubulin |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=95 |issue=8 |pages=4368–4373 |year=1998 |pmid=9539743 |pmc=22495 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.8.4368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protein modifications===
By multiple [[gene knockout]] ''Physcomitrella'' plants were engineered, that lack the plant-specific [[glycosylation]] of proteins, an important post-translational modification. These knockout mosses are used to produce complex [[biopharmaceuticals]] in the field of [[molecular farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koprivova |first1=Anna |last2=Stemmer |first2=Christian |last3=Altmann |first3=Friedrich |last4=Hoffmann |first4=Axel |last5=Kopriva |first5=Stanislav |last6=Gorr |first6=Gilbert |last7=Reski |first7=Ralf |last8=Decker |first8=Eva L. |title=Targeted knockouts of Physcomitrella lacking plant-specific immunogenic N-glycans |journal=Plant Biotechnology Journal |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=517–23 |year=2004 |pmid=17147624 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7652.2004.00100.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutant collection===
In cooperation with the chemical company [[BASF]] Ralf Reski and coworkers established a collection of knockout mosses that is used for gene identification.&lt;ref name="pmid12123528"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj0013 BASF and Freiburg University to collaborate on plant biotechnology]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mediocrity principle''' is the [[philosophical]] notion that "if an item is drawn at random from one of several sets or categories, it's likelier to come from the most numerous category than from any one of the less numerous categories".&lt;ref name="Kukla2009"&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Kukla |year=2009 |title=Extraterrestrials: A Philosophical Perspective |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739142455 |lccn=2009032272 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkdqTFVNwmgC&amp;pg=PA20 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has been taken to suggest that there is nothing very unusual about the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|evolution of the Solar System]], [[Earth's history]], the [[evolution of biological complexity]], [[human evolution]], or any one [[nation]]. It is a [[heuristic]] in the vein of the [[Copernican principle]], and is sometimes used as a philosophical statement about the place of humanity. The idea is to assume mediocrity, rather than starting with the assumption that a phenomenon is special, privileged, exceptional, or even [[supremacism|superior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1377474/principle-of-mediocrity|title=principle of mediocrity - astrobiology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MediocrePZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_12.html#myerspz|title=THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2011 — Page 12|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraterrestrial life==
[[File:Grand prismatic spring.jpg|thumb|200px|Life is ubiquitous on Earth, but does it exist elsewhere?]]

The mediocrity principle suggests, given the existence of life on Earth, that [[life]] typically exists on [[Earth analog|Earth-like planet]]s throughout the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, Eric, and Steve McMillan. ''Astronomy: A Beginner’s Guide to the Universe.'' Ed. Nancy Whilton. San Francisco: Pearson, 2010.{{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other approaches==

The mediocrity principle is in contrast with the [[anthropic principle]], which asserts that the presence of an intelligent observer (humans) limits the circumstances to bounds under which intelligent life can be [[Observation bias|observed to exist]], no matter [[Rare Earth hypothesis|how improbable]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec24.html Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt; Both stand in contrast to the [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuning hypothesis]], which asserts that the natural conditions for intelligent life are implausibly rare.

The mediocrity principle implies that Earth-like environments are necessarily common, based in part on the evidence of [[Doomsday argument|any happening at all]], whereas the anthropic principle suggests that no assertion can be made about the probability of intelligent life based on a sample set of one ([[Dunning–Kruger effect|self-described]]) example, who are necessarily capable of making such an assertion about themselves.

It is also possible to handle the Mediocrity Principle as a statistical problem, a case of a single [[Data point]] statistics, also present in the [[German tank problem]].

==Other uses==
[[David Deutsch]] argues that the mediocrity principle is incorrect from a physical point of view, in reference to either humanity's part of the universe or to its species. Deutsch refers to [[Stephen Hawking]]'s quote: "The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies". Deutsch wrote that Earth's neighborhood in the universe is not typical (80% of the universe's matter is [[dark matter]]) and that a concentration of mass such as the Solar System is an "isolated, uncommon phenomenon". He also disagrees with [[Richard Dawkins]], who considers that humans, because of natural evolution, are limited to the capabilities of their species. Deutsch responds that even though evolution did not give humans the ability to detect [[neutrino]]s, scientists can currently detect them, which significantly expands their capabilities beyond what is available as a result of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-14-196969-5 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |author=[[David Deutsch]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

==History ==

MEST was announced in 2007, when [[Meltwater Group|Meltwater]] announced plans to establish an entrepreneurial training program in Africa. The school opened in February 2008 with the first class of Entrepreneurs in Training (EITs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconafrica.com/meltwater-incubator-a-year-in-review/|title=A Year in Review at Meltwater Incubator in Accra - Ghana|publisher=Silicon Africa|first=Monica|last=Jamaluddin|date=23 January 2013|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, the first class of EITs graduated and the MEST [[Business incubator|Incubator]] was launched with [[seed funding]] for incubator companies started by the first group of EITs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/14/out-of-africa-a-whole-mest-of-startups-emerges-in-ghana/|title=Out of Africa - A Whole MEST of Startups Emerges in Ghana|publisher=TechCrunch|first=Mike|last=Butcher|date=14 June 2012|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nanzo-in''' ({{Nihongo2|南蔵院|help=yes}}) is a Shingon sect Buddhist temple in Sasaguri, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. It is notable for its bronze statue of a reclining Buddha, said to be the largest bronze statue in the world.

==History==
[[File:Gate of Nanzoin Temple in Sasaguri, Kasuya, Fukuoka.JPG|thumb|Gate to Nanzoin Temple in Sasaguri, Fukuoka, Japan.]]
Nanzo-in temple was originally located on [[Mountain Kōya|Mt. Koyasan]], but local anti-Buddhist authorities threatened to destroy the temple in 1886&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.japan.travel/in/spot/2167/|title=Nanzo-in Temple|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Public outcry lead to a decade-long effort to have the temple transferred to [[Sasaguri, Fukuoka|Sasaguri]].&lt;ref name=ACROS&gt;{{cite book|last1=ACROS|first1=Fukuoka|title=Fukuoka Guide Spring 2011|date=2011|publisher=ACROS Fukuoka}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was moved in 1899, under the leadership of Sasaguri priest, Hayashi Satoshiun.&lt;ref name=Sasagurikanko&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kanko|first1=Sasaguri|title=Sasaguri Tourism: Nanzoin Temple (Japanese)|url=http://www.sasagurikanko.com/temple/nanzoin/|website=Sasagurikanko.com|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanzo-in temple is the main location among the 88 temples that make up the Sasaguri pilgrimage route, one of the three famous walking [[pilgrimage]]s in Japan.&lt;ref name=Crossroads /&gt;

Today, the temple and its surrounding grounds receive more than 1 million visitors annually.&lt;ref name=Crossroads&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fukuoka|first1=Crossroads|title=Nanzoin Temple|url=http://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/en/event/?mode=detail&amp;id=4000000000402&amp;isSpot=1|publisher=Crossroads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lottery===
A chief priest of Nanzo-in temple once won the lottery after laying his ticket next to a statue of [[Daikokuten|Daikoku]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://taiken.co/single/nanzo-in-temple-the-reclining-buddha-temple/|title=Nanzo-in Temple: The Reclining Buddha Temple|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The temple claims that others who have made a similar effort have also won the lottery, bringing the temple associations with luck and lottery tickets.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bemarietravels.com/nanzoin-temple-fukuoka/|title=The Beautiful Nanzoin Temple Fukuoka|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reclining Buddha==
[[File:Reclining Buddha in Nanzoin Temple 20150429.JPG|thumb|The reclining Buddha statue at Nanzoin Temple in Sasaguri, Fukuoka, Japan.]]
The reclining [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] statue, known as either ''Nehanzo'' or ''Shaka Nehan'' ("Nirvana")&lt;ref name=Macleans&gt;{{cite web|title=Karmic Cleansing|url=http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/karmic-cleansing/|website=Macleans.ca|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is 41 meters long, 11 meters high, and weighs nearly 300 tons.&lt;ref name="Sasaguri Town"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sasaguri-shi|title=Sasaguri Sight-Seeing Spots|publisher=Sasaguri Town|url=http://www.town.sasaguri.fukuoka.jp/userfiles/files/data/create/lecture/sightseeing_spots.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue depicts Buddha at the moment of death, or entrance into [[nirvana]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The interior holds ashes of Buddha and two Buddhist adherents, [[Ananda]] and [[Maudgalyayana]]. Those relics were a gift from Myanmar as thanks for the sect's donations of medical supplies to children in both [[Nepal]] and [[Myanmar]].&lt;ref name=Sasagurikanko /&gt; In 1995, 1,300 monks from Myanmar and Nepal attended the unveiling of the reclining Buddha statue.&lt;ref name=Sasagurikanko /&gt;

Inside the sculpture, sand from each of the 88 shrines that make up the [[Shikoku Pilgrimage|Shikoku pilgrimage]] are stored below bricks within a narrow hallway.&lt;ref name=Nakamura&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nakamura|first1=Connie|title=Sasaguri Town - Mini Pilgrimage And More!|url=http://taiken.co/single/sasaguri-town-mini-pilgrimage-and-more|website=Taiken.co|publisher=Taiken|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year, hundreds of Buddhists come together to clean the statue using bamboo leaves tied to five-meter poles.&lt;ref name=Macleans /&gt;

==Funerals==
Nanzo-in Temple has 4,315 ''nokotsudo,'' places where bones of the deceased are stored.&lt;ref name=Bryant /&gt; The temple has a non-traditional fee structure for housing remains. First, it is open to all sects of Buddhism, and is even open to [[Shinto]] remains. Secondly, many Buddhist temples rely on a monthly fee for housing the bones of the deceased, which are then disposed of after a set period of time. Nanzo-in Temple has one fee, which covers 200 years.&lt;ref name=Bryant&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryant|first1=Clifton|title=Handbook of Death and Dying|date=2003|publisher=SAGE|page=668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nyotaimori.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|In Nyotaimori, a nude woman's body serves as a food plate]]
{{nihongo3|"serve (foods) on the female body"|女体盛り|'''Nyotaimori'''}}, often referred to as '''"body sushi"''', is the Japanese practice of serving [[sashimi]] or [[sushi]] from the naked body of a woman.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bindel|first=Julie|title='I am about to eat sushi off a naked woman's body' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/12/nyotaimori-eating-sushi-naked-woman|publisher=The Guardian|date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nihongo3||男体盛り|'''Nantaimori'''}} refers to the same practice using a [[male model]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} 

The Japanese practice of ''nyotaimori'' – serving sushi on a naked body – is said to have its origins in the samurai period in Japan.&lt;ref name=Waves&gt;[http://www.insidevancouver.ca/2014/09/06/naked-sushi-makes-waves-in-vancouver/ "Naked Sushi Makes Waves in Vancouver"], ''Inside Vancouver'', 6 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of chef Mike Keenan, "The naked sushi idea began during the samurai period in Japan. It was a subculture to the [[geisha]]s. It would take place in a geisha house as a celebration after a victorious battle."&lt;ref name=Plate&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Naked+Sushi+touch+plate/10161213/story.html "Naked Sushi: Eat but don't touch the plate"],  ''Vancouver Sun'', 30 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyotaimori originated in [[Ishikawa Prefecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= http://www.cyzo.com/2013/06/post_13616.html| title= 日本人が抱く、裸体への悲しき郷愁「女体盛り」の深すぎる歴史を探る！| publisher =  R-18 | date = 16 May 2015| accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= http://www.menscyzo.com/2012/04/post_3941.html| title=【ニッポンの裏風俗】お手頃料金で遊べる温泉風俗| publisher = メンズサイゾー| date = 27 April 2012| accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= http://www.cyzo.com/2013/06/post_13616.html| title= 日本人が抱く、裸体への悲しき郷愁「女体盛り」の深すぎる歴史を探る！| publisher = 日刊サイゾー | date = 15 June 2013| accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to be practiced there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= http://www.super-compa.net/010_plan/detail.php?id=195| title= 山乃湯の宴会コンパニオン・スーパーコンパニオンプラン一覧| publisher = スーパーコンパニオン旅行| date = 2012| accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedures==
In traditional ''nyotaimori'', the model is generally expected to lie still at all times and not talk with guests. The sushi is placed on sanitized leaves on the model's body to prevent skin-to-fish contact and on sufficiently flat areas of the body off which the sushi will not roll. ''Nyotaimori'' is considered an art form.&lt;ref name=Waves/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://supervancouver.com/naked-sushi-vancouver/ "Your Fantasy Of Eating Sushi Off A Naked Woman In Vancouver Is Now A Reality"], SuperVancouver&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually champagne and sake are served in naked sushi restaurants. Guests must be respectful and observe the strictest decorum. Talking with the models is highly discouraged. Inappropriate gestures or comments are not tolerated and diners can only pick up sushi with chopsticks, although rules in some restaurants are less strict. For example, in some restaurants guests can nibble nori rolls off nipples if they choose.&lt;ref name=Waves/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2184672/Diners-pay-500-eat-sushi-NUDE-MODELS-Florida-restaurant.html "Naked ambition: Diners pay $500 to eat sushi off NUDE MODELS at Florida restaurant"] ''Daily Mail'', 6 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2014/08/naked-sushi-now-vancouver/ "Naked Sushi Now in Vancouver"], ''VanCity Buzz'', 28 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Nyotaimori 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Guest eating sushi directly from a model's body at [[Burning Flipside]] event, USA, 2007]]

The practice has been described as decadent,&lt;ref name=wei-inde&gt;{{cite web|first=Gareth |last=Vipers |title=The world's weirdest dining experiences |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/the-worlds-weirdest-dining-experiences-1982479.html?action=gallery&amp;ino=4 |date=1 June 2010 |publisher=The Independent |page=4 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911002219/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/the-worlds-weirdest-dining-experiences-1982479.html?action=gallery&amp;ino=4 |archive-date=11 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; humiliating,&lt;ref name=str11/&gt; cruel,&lt;ref name=str11/&gt; and objectifying.&lt;ref name=str11&gt;{{cite book | last=Strong | first=Jeremy | title=Educated Tastes: Food, Drink, and Connoisseur Culture | publisher=University of Nebraska Press | year=2011 | location=Lincoln | isbn=9780803219359 | pages=168–189 | chapter=A Short Poetics of Cruel Food}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Guardian'' columnist [[Julie Bindel]] notes that the woman being used to serve the food, on at least one occasion in London, looked "as if in a morgue, awaiting a postmortem".&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; It has received popularity in [[Japanese organized crime]].&lt;ref name=str11/&gt;

Worldwide reception varies as several countries have banned the practice.&lt;ref name=wei-inde/&gt; In 2005, China has outlawed nyotaimori on naked&lt;!--specifically--&gt; bodies, condemning it due to public health reasons and moral issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Roberts| first=Christine| title=Nipples covered in wasabi?

An '''oil dispersant''' is a mixture of [[emulsifier]]s and [[solvent]]s that helps break oil into small droplets following an [[oil spill]]. Small droplets are easier to [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] throughout a water volume, and small droplets may be more readily [[biodegrade]]d by [[microbes]] in the water. Dispersant use involves a trade-off between exposing [[coastal ecology|coastal life]] to surface oil and exposing aquatic life to dispersed oil. While submerging the oil with dispersant may lessen exposure to [[marine life]] on the surface, it increases exposure for animals dwelling underwater, who may be harmed by [[toxicity]] of both dispersed oil and dispersant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treating oil spills with chemical dispersants: Is the cure worse than the ailment?|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130705212219.htm|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dispersants EPA.gov|url=http://www.epa.gov/bpspill/dispersants.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dispersants|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/energy/dirty_energy_development/oil_and_gas/gulf_oil_spill/dispersants.html|work=Center for Biological Diversity|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although dispersant reduces the amount of oil that lands ashore, it may allow faster, deeper penetration of oil into coastal terrain, where it is not easily biodegraded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study: Dispersants Can Move Hydrocarbons Faster and Deeper into Gulf Sand|url=http://gulfresearchinitiative.org/study-dispersants-can-move-hydrocarbons-faster-and-deeper-into-gulf-sand/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Torrey Canyon oil spill}}
In 1967, the supertanker ''[[Torrey Canyon oil spill|Torrey Canyon]]'' leaked oil onto the English coastline.&lt;ref name=Clayton /&gt;  [[Alkylphenol]] [[surfactant]]s were primarily used to break up the oil, but proved very toxic in the marine environment; all types of marine life were killed. This led to a reformulation of dispersants to be more environmentally sensitive. After the ''Torrey Canyon'' spill, new boat-spraying systems were developed.&lt;ref name=Clayton /&gt; Later reformulations allowed more dispersant to be contained (at a higher concentration) to be [[aerosolize]]d.

==={{anchor|Exxon Valdez}}''Exxon Valdez''===
{{Main article|Exxon Valdez oil spill}}
Alaska had fewer than 4,000 gallons of dispersants available at the time of the ''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill, and no aircraft with which to dispense them. The dispersants introduced were relatively ineffective due to insufficient wave action to mix the oil and water, and their use was shortly abandoned.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;EPA: Learning Center: Exxon Valdez.  http://www.epa.gov/oem/content/learning/exxon.htm accessed 5/23/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by [[David Kirby (journalist)|David Kirby]] for [[TakePart]] found that the main component of the [[Corexit|Corexit 9527]] formulation used during Exxon Valdez cleanup, [[2-butoxyethanol]], was identified as "one of the agents that caused liver, kidney, lung, nervous system, and blood disorders among cleanup crews in Alaska following the 1989 ''Exxon Valdez'' spill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corexit: An Oil Spill Solution Worse Than the Problem?|url=http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/04/17/corexit-deepwater-horizon-oil-spill|work=TakePart|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early use (by volume) ===
Dispersants were applied to a number of oil spills between the years 1967 and 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/energy/shell_energy_day/assets/pdfs/Jafvert%20Shell%20Oil%20Day%20Talk.pdf|title = Understanding oil dispersants|date = 2011-09-23|accessdate = 2015-03-07|website = School of Civil Engineering &amp; Division of Environmental and Ecological Engineering|publisher = Purdue University|last = Jafvert|first = Chad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Deepwater Horizon oil spill}}
During the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, an estimated 1.84 million gallons of [[Corexit]] was used in an attempt to reduce the amount of surface oil and mitigate the damage to coastal habitat. BP purchased one-third of the world's supply of Corexit soon after the spill began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Less Toxic Dispersants Lose Out in BP Oil Spill Cleanup|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/business/energy-environment/13greenwire-less-toxic-dispersants-lose-out-in-bp-oil-spil-81183.html?_r=1&amp;|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly half (771,000 gallons) of the dispersants were applied directly at the wellhead.&lt;ref name="Gov't Commission"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling |title=Use of Surface and Subsea Dispersants During the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill |url=https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=16795 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary dispersant used were [[Corexit]] [[Corexit#Composition|9527 and 9500]], which were controversial due to [[toxicity]].

In 2012, a study found that Corexit made the oil up to 52 times more toxic than oil alone,&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.gatech.edu/newsroom/release.html?nid=174381 GT | Newsroom - Gulf of Mexico Clean-Up Makes 2010 Spill 52-Times More Toxic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the dispersant's emulsifying effect makes oil droplets more bio-available to [[plankton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livescience.com/25159-oil-dispersant-increases-toxicity.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] found that "Mixing oil with dispersant increased [[ecotoxicity|toxicity to ecosystems]]" and made the gulf oil spill worse.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.sciencerecorder.com/news/study-mixing-oil-with-dispersant-made-the-bp-oil-spill-worse/ Study: Mixing oil with dispersant made the BP oil spill worse | Science Recorder&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, in response to the growing body of laboratory-derived toxicity data, some researchers address the scrutiny that should be used when evaluating laboratory test results that have been extrapolated using procedures that are not fully reliable for environmental assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coelho|first=Gina|last2=Clark|first2=James|last3=Aurand|first3=Don|date=2013-06-01|title=Toxicity testing of dispersed oil requires adherence to standardized protocols to assess potential real world effects|journal=Environmental Pollution (Barking, Essex: 1987)|volume=177|pages=185–188|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.004|issn=1873-6424|pmid=23497795}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bejarano|first=Adriana C.|last2=Clark|first2=James R.|last3=Coelho|first3=Gina M.|date=2014-04-01|title=Issues and challenges with oil toxicity data and implications for their use in decision making: A quantitative review|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/etc.2501/abstract|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry|language=en|volume=33|issue=4|pages=732–742|doi=10.1002/etc.2501|issn=1552-8618}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, guidance has been published that improves the comparability and relevance of oil toxicity tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Redman|first=Aaron D.|last2=Parkerton|first2=Thomas F.|date=2015-09-15|title=Guidance for improving comparability and relevance of oil toxicity tests|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X15004208|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=98|issue=1–2|pages=156–170|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.06.053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maritime New Zealand]] used the oil dispersant [[Corexit|Corexit 9500]] to help in the cleanup process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/rena-crisis/5767822/Dispersants-worse-than-oil&lt;/ref&gt; The dispersant was applied for only a week, after results proved inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/Science-Stories/Where-Land-Meets-Sea/Cleaning-up-the-oil-spill&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

==={{anchor|Overview}}Overview===
Surfactants reduce oil-water [[interfacial tension]], which helps waves break oil into small droplets. A mixture of oil and water is normally unstable, but can be stabilized with the addition of surfactants; these surfactants can prevent coalescence of dispersed oil droplets. The effectiveness of the dispersant depends on the weathering of the oil, sea energy (waves), salinity of the water, temperature and the type of oil.&lt;ref name=Fingas&gt;{{cite book|last=Fingas|first=Merv|title=The Basics of Oil Spill Cleanup|year=2001|publisher=Lewis Publishers|isbn=1-56670-537-1|pages=120–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dispersion is unlikely to occur if the oil spreads into a thin layer, because the dispersant requires a particular thickness to work; otherwise, the dispersant will interact with both the water and the oil. More dispersant may be required if the sea energy is low. The salinity of the water is more important for ionic-surfactant dispersants, as salt [[Electric-field screening|screens]] electrostatic interactions between molecules. The [[viscosity]] of the oil is another important factor; viscosity can retard dispersant migration to the oil-water interface and also increase the energy required to shear a drop from the slick. Viscosities below 2,000 centi[[Poise (unit)|poise]] are optimal for dispersants. If the viscosity is above 10,000 centipoise, no dispersion is possible.&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{cite book|last=National Research Council (U.S.)|title=Using Oil Spill Dispersants on the Sea|year=1989|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Requirements===
There are five requirements for surfactants to successfully disperse oil:&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt; 
*Dispersant must be on the oil's surface in the proper concentration
*Dispersant must penetrate (mix with) the oil
* Surfactant molecules must orient at the oil-water interface (hydrophobic in oil and [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] in water)
* Oil-water interfacial tension must be lowered (so the oil can be broken up).
* Energy must be applied to the mix (for example, by waves)

===Effectiveness===
The effectiveness of a dispersant may be analyzed with the following equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chandrasekar|first1=Subhashini|last2=Sorial|first2=George|last3=Weaver|first3=James|title=Dispersant effectiveness on oil spills – impact of salinity|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science |date=2006|volume=63|pages=1418–1430|doi=10.1016/j.icesjms.2006.04.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Area refers to the area under the absorbance/wavelength curve, which is determined using the trapezoidal rule. The absorbances are measured at 340, 370, and 400&amp;nbsp;nm.

Area = 30(Abs&lt;sub&gt;340&lt;/sub&gt; + Abs&lt;sub&gt;370&lt;/sub&gt;)/2 + 30(Abs&lt;sub&gt;340&lt;/sub&gt; + Abs&lt;sub&gt;400&lt;/sub&gt;)/2           (1)

The dispersant effectiveness may then be calculated using the equation below.

Effectiveness (%) = Total oil dispersed x 100/(ρ&lt;sub&gt;oil&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;oil&lt;/sub&gt;)

* ρ&lt;sub&gt;oil&lt;/sub&gt; = density of the test oil (g/L)
* V&lt;sub&gt;oil&lt;/sub&gt; = volume of oil added to test flask (L)
* Total oil dispersed = mass of oil x 120mL/30mL
* Mass of oil = concentration oil x V&lt;sub&gt;DCM&lt;/sub&gt;
* V&lt;sub&gt;DCM&lt;/sub&gt; = final volume of DCM-extract of water sample (0.020 L)
* Concentration of oil = area determined by Equation (1) / slope of calibration curve

==={{anchor|Dispersion Models}}Dispersion models===
Developing well-constructed models (accounting for variables such as oil type, salinity and surfactant) are necessary to select the appropriate dispersant in a given situation. Two models exist which integrate the use of dispersants: Mackay's model and Johansen's model.&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"&gt;National Research Council Committee on Effectiveness of Oil Spill Dispersants: Using Oil Dispersants on the Sea, National Academy Press, 1989 pp 63-75&lt;/ref&gt; There are several parameters which must be considered when creating a dispersion model, including oil-slick thickness, [[advection]], resurfacing and wave action.&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt; A general problem in modeling dispersants is that they change several of these parameters; surfactants lower the thickness of the film, increase the amount of diffusion into the water column and increase the amount of breakup caused by wave action. This causes the oil slick's behavior to be more dominated by vertical diffusion than horizontal advection.&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt;

One equation for the modeling of oil spills is:&lt;ref name= "Tkalich"&gt;Tkalich,P Xiaobo,C Accurate Simulation of Oil Slicks, Tropical marine science institute, Presented 2001 International Oil Spill Conference pp 1133-1135 http://www.ioscproceedings.org/doi/pdf/10.7901/2169-3358-2001-2-1133&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial h}{\partial t} + \vec \nabla \left(h \left( \vec {U} + \frac {\vec \tau }{f} \right) \right) - \vec \nabla (E \vec \nabla h) = R &lt;/math&gt;

where

* ''h'' is the oil-slick thickness
* &lt;math&gt;\vec {U}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of ocean currents in the mixing layer of the water column (where oil and water mix together)
* &lt;math&gt;\vec \tau&lt;/math&gt; is the wind-driven shear stress
* ''f'' is the oil-water friction coefficient
* ''E'' is the relative difference in densities between the oil and water
* ''R'' is the rate of spill propagation

Mackay's model predicts an increasing dispersion rate, as the slick becomes thinner in one dimension. The model predicts that thin slicks will disperse faster than thick slicks for several reasons. Thin slicks are less effective at dampening waves and other sources of turbidity. Additionally, droplets formed upon dispersion are expected to be smaller in a thin slick and thus easier to disperse in water.
The model also includes:&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt;

* An expression for the diameter of the oil drop
* Temperature dependence of oil movement
* An expression for the resurfacing of oil
* Calibrations based on data from experimental spills

The model is lacking in several areas: it does not account for evaporation, the topography of the ocean floor or the geography of the spill zone.&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt;

Johansen's model is more complex than Mackay's model. It considers particles to be in one of three states: at the surface, [[Entrainment (hydrodynamics)|entrained]] in the water column or evaporated. The empirically based model uses probabilistic variables to determine where the dispersant will move and where it will go after it breaks up oil slicks. The drift of each particle is determined by the state of that particle; this means that a particle in the vapor state will travel much further than a particle on the surface (or under the surface) of the ocean.&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt; This model improves on Mackay's model in several key areas, including terms for:&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt;

* Probability of entrainment – depends on wind
* Probability of resurfacing – depends on density, droplet size, time submerged and wind
* Probability of evaporation – matched with empirical data

Oil dispersants are modeled by Johansen using a different set of entrainment and resurfacing parameters for treated versus untreated oil. This allows areas of the oil slick to be modeled differently, to better understand how oil spreads along the water's surface.

=={{anchor|Surfactants}}Surfactants==
{{Main article|Surfactants}}
Surfactants are classified into four main types, each with different properties and applications: [[anion]]ic, cationic, nonionic and [[zwitterion]]ic (or amphoteric). Anionic surfactants are compounds that contain an anionic polar group. Examples of anionic surfactants include [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] and [[dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate]].&lt;ref name="Butler et. al." /&gt; Included in this class of surfactants are sodium alkylcarboxylates (soaps).&lt;ref name="Butt"&gt;Butt, Hans-Jürgen.  Graf, Karlheinz. Kappl, Michael.  "Physics and Chemistry of Interfaces".  2nd Edition.  WILEY-VCH. pp 265-299. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cationic surfactats are similar in nature to anionic surfactants, except the surfactant molecules carry a positive charge at the hydrophilic portion. Many of these compounds are [[Quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary ammonium salts]], as well as [[cetrimonium bromide]] (CTAB).&lt;ref name=Butt /&gt; Non-ionic surfactants are non-charged and together with anionic surfactants make up the majority of oil-dispersant formulations.&lt;ref name="Butler et. al." /&gt; The hydrophilic portion of the surfactant contains polar [[functional groups]], such as -OH or -NH.&lt;ref name=Butt /&gt; Zwitterionic surfactants are the most expensive, and are used for specific applications.&lt;ref name=Butt /&gt; These compounds have both positively and negatively charged components. An example of a zwitterionic compound is [[phosphatidylcholine]], which as a lipid is largely insoluble in water.&lt;ref name=Butt /&gt;

==={{anchor|HLB Values}}HLB values===
Surfactant behavior is highly dependent on the [[hydrophilic-lipophilic balance]] (HLB) value. The HLB is a coding scale from 0 to 20 for non-[[ion]]ic surfactants, and takes into account the chemical structure of the surfactant molecule. A zero value corresponds to the most [[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]] and a value of 20 is the most hydrophilic for a non-ionic surfactant.&lt;ref name=Clayton&gt;{{cite book|last=Clayton|first=John R.|title=Oil Spill Dispersants: Mechanisms of Action and Laboratory Tests|year=1992|publisher= C K Smoley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-87371-946-8|pages=9–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, compounds with an HLB between one and four will not mix with water. Compounds with an HLB value above 13 will form a clear solution in water.&lt;ref name="Butler et. al."&gt;Using Oil Spill Dispersants.  National Academy Press.  pp 29-32 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Oil dispersants usually have HLB values from 8–18.&lt;ref name="Butler et. al." /&gt;

== {{anchor|Comparative Industrial Formulations}}Comparative industrial formulations ==
Two formulations of different dispersing agents for oil spills, Dispersit and Omni-Clean, are shown below. A key difference between the two is that Omni-Clean uses ionic surfactants and Dispersit uses entirely non-ionic surfactants. Omni-Clean was formulated for little or no toxicity toward the environment. Dispersit, however, was designed as a competitor with Corexit. Dispersit contains non-ionic surfactants, which permit both primarily oil-soluble and primarily water-soluble surfactants. The partitioning of surfactants between the phases allows for effective dispersion.

=={{anchor|Degradation and Toxicity}}Degradation and toxicity==
Both the degradation and the toxicity of dispersants depend on the chemicals chosen within the formulation. Compounds which interact too harshly with oil dispersants should be tested to ensure that they meet three criteria:&lt;ref name=Mulkins&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mulkins-Phillips|first=G. J.|author2=Stewart, J.E.|title=Effect of Four Dispersants on Biodegradation and Growth of Bacteria on Crude Oil|journal=Applied Microbiology|date=October 1974|volume=28|pages=547–552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* They should be biodegradable.
* In the presence of oil, they must not be preferentially utilized as a carbon source.
* They must be nontoxic to indigenous bacteria.

=={{anchor|Methods of Use}}Methods of use==
[[File:FRBR 160716 Boeing 727 G-OSRA 01.jpg|thumb|Oil Spill Response [[Boeing 727]] displaying its dispersants delivery system at the 2016 [[Farnborough Airshow]]]]
Dispersants can be delivered in aerosolized form by an aircraft or boat. Sufficient dispersant with droplets in the proper size are necessary; this can be achieved with an appropriate pumping rate. Droplets larger than 1,000&amp;nbsp;µm are preferred, to ensure they are not blown away by the wind. The ratio of dispersant to oil is typically 1:20.&lt;ref name=Fingas /&gt;

== Applications of biochemistry==
* Testing
** [[Ames test]] &amp;ndash; salmonella bacteria is exposed to a chemical under question (a food additive, for example), and changes in the way the bacteria grows are measured. This test is useful for screening chemicals to see if they mutate the structure of DNA and by extension identifying their potential to cause cancer in humans.
** [[Pregnancy test]] &amp;ndash; one uses a urine sample and the other a blood sample. Both detect the presence of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).This hormone is produced by the placenta shortly after implantation of the embryo into the uterine walls and accumulates.
** [[Breast cancer screening]] &amp;ndash; identification of risk by testing for mutations in two genes&amp;mdash;Breast Cancer-1 gene (BRCA1) and the Breast Cancer-2 gene (BRCA2)&amp;mdash;allow a woman to schedule increased screening tests at a more frequent rate than the general population.
** [[Prenatal genetic testing]] &amp;ndash; testing the fetus for potential genetic defects, to detect chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome or birth defects such as spina bifida.
** [[Phenylketonuria#Screening and presentation|PKU test]] &amp;ndash; Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder in which the individual is missing an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. Absence of this enzyme allows the buildup of phenylalanine, which can lead to mental retardation.
* [[Genetic engineering]] &amp;ndash; taking a gene from one organism and placing it into another. Biochemists inserted the gene for human insulin into bacteria.  The bacteria, travels through the process of translation, create human insulin.
* [[Cloning]] &amp;ndash; Dolly the sheep was the first mammal ever cloned from adult animal cells. The cloned sheep was, of course, genetically identical to the original adult sheep.  This clone was created by taking cells from the udder of a 6-year-old ewe and growing them in the lab.
* [[Gene therapy]] &amp;ndash; a modified or healthy gene is inserted into the organism to replace a disease-causing gene. Commonly a virus that has been altered to carry human DNA is used to deliver the healthy gene to the targeted cells of the patient. This process was first used successfully in 1990 on a 4-year-old patient who lacked an immune system due to a rare genetic disease called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).

'''''Patriarchy''''' is a 2007 book by [[V. Geetha]], an academic activist and author on the subject of [[patriarchy]] in [[India]]. The book, written from the female perspective, is part of the "Theorizing Feminism" series published by Stree (an imprint of [[Bhatkal and Sen]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/patriarchy-through-the-feminist-lens/article1446078.ece|title = Patriarchy Through the Feminist Lens|last = Swaminathan|first = Padmini|date = 2 January 2008|work = The Hindu|access-date = 22 August 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three editions have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.worldcat.org/title/patriarchy/oclc/154204766/editions?editionsView=true&amp;referer=br|title = Patriarchy listing on WorldCat|date = |accessdate = 22 August 2015|website = WorldCat|publisher = OCLC|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In India, [[patriarchy]] disrupts women's lives. According to Geetha,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.saarthakindia.org/womens_situation_India.html|title = Women's Situation in India|date = |accessdate = 22 August 2015|website = Saarthak|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sexual violence has been blamed on a patriarchal backlash where the term 'patriarchy' is often synonymous with 'tradition{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/17/sexual-violence-india-patriarchal-narendra-modi-women-reform-rape|title = Sexual Violence in India is a Patriarchal Backlash That Must Be Stopped|last = Virmani|first = Priya|date = 17 June 2014|work = The Guardian|access-date = 22 August 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminism]] has a long tradition of examining the concept of patriarchy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://isj.org.uk/theories-of-patriarchy/|title = Theories of Patriarchy|last = German|first = Lindsey|date = 1981|journal = International Socialism|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 22 August 2015|issue = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the book attempts to demonstrate that the nature, effect, and meanings of male authority and power can only be understood through the idea of patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 203&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
''Patriarchy'' introduces readers to [[concept]]s in [[feminist theory]] involving [[patriarchy]]. According to Geetha, "The book does not propound a theory of patriarchy; rather, it points to those areas of reality and traditions of knowledge that we might need to draw upon to define patriarchy. It indicates the need for theory-making, and shows how this may be done. Its intent is fundamentally [[pedagogical]] and is a beginners' text to help the reader consider patriarchy in all its aspects".&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

She describes how knowledge about patriarchy cannot be easily separated from the feminist desire to generate such knowledge:&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 4- 61&lt;/ref&gt; "By understanding patriarchy, the notions of production and reproduction are important concepts". Geetha highlights unique aspects of [[Culture of India|Indian society]], such as kinship structures and the [[caste system]],&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 61-131&lt;/ref&gt; to better understand patriarchy. According to the author, "A woman's identity as a citizen and rights to equality are undercut by the fact of their gender".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Geetha theorizes that patriarchal power "is not merely coercive ... Cultural and sexual [[norm (social)|norm]]s constitute the everyday exercise of patriarchal power".&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 131- 203&lt;/ref&gt; She also writes, "Sexuality is a crucial link between [[caste]] and gender, so that [[marriage]] and sexual rules are not only set by caste, but also the notions of right pleasure are defined by it."&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj.

The sequence of events that are followed in phage display screening to identify polypeptides that bind with high affinity to desired target protein or DNA sequence.]]
'''Phage display''' is a laboratory technique for the study of [[Protein–protein interaction|protein–protein]], [[protein]]–[[peptide]], and protein–[[DNA]] interactions that uses [[bacteriophage]]s ([[viruses]] that infect [[bacteria]]) to connect proteins with the [[genetic information]] that [[code|encodes]] them.&lt;ref name="Smith_1985"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smith GP | title = Filamentous fusion phage: novel expression vectors that display cloned antigens on the virion surface | journal = Science | volume = 228 | issue = 4705 | pages = 1315–7 |date=June 1985 | pmid = 4001944 | doi = 10.1126/science.4001944 |bibcode = 1985Sci...228.1315S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this technique, a gene encoding a protein of interest is inserted into a phage [[viral coat protein|coat protein]] gene, causing the phage to "display" the protein on its outside while containing the gene for the protein on its inside, resulting in a  connection between [[genotype]] and [[phenotype]]. These displaying phages can then be screened against other proteins, peptides or DNA sequences, in order to detect interaction between the displayed protein and those other molecules. In this way, large [[protein fragment library|libraries of proteins]] can be screened and [[amplification (molecular biology)|amplified]] in a process called ''[[in vitro]]'' selection, which is analogous to [[natural selection]].

The most common bacteriophages used in phage display are [[M13 bacteriophage|M13]] and fd [[filamentous phage]],&lt;ref name="pmid11848876"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith GP, Petrenko VA | title = Phage Display | journal = Chem.

==History==
Phage display was first described by [[George Smith (chemist)|George P. Smith]] in 1985, when he demonstrated the display of peptides on [[filamentous phage]] by creating [[Fusion protein|fusion]] of the virus's [[Capsid|capsid protein]] to a library of [[peptide]] sequences.&lt;ref name="Smith_1985" /&gt; This displayed the peptides on the viral surface, where those with the highest binding affinity could be selected. A patent by George Pieczenik claiming priority from 1985 also describes the generation of phage display libraries.&lt;ref name="US_5866363"&gt;{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 5866363  | status = patent | title = Method and means for sorting and identifying biological information | pubdate = 1999-02-02 | fdate = 1991-02-28 | pridate = 1985-08-28 | inventor = Pieczenik G}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology was further developed and improved by groups at the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] with [[Greg Winter]] and [[John McCafferty]], The [[Scripps Research Institute]] with Lerner and Barbas and the [[German Cancer Research Center]] with Breitling and Dübel for display of proteins such as [[antibodies]] for [[therapeutic]] [[protein engineering]]. Smith and Winter were awarded a half share of the 2018 Nobel Prize in chemistry for their contribution to developing phage display.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2018/summary/|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2018|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle ==

Like the [[two-hybrid system]], phage display is used for the high-throughput screening of protein interactions. In the case of [[M13 bacteriophage|M13 filamentous phage]] display, the DNA encoding the protein or peptide of interest is [[DNA ligase|ligated]] into the pIII or pVIII gene, encoding either the minor or major [[Protein of the viral capsid|coat protein]], respectively. [[Multiple cloning site]]s are sometimes used to ensure that the fragments are inserted in all three possible [[reading frames]] so that the [[cDNA]] fragment is [[Gene translation|translated]] in the proper frame. The phage gene and insert [[DNA hybridization|DNA hybrid]] is then inserted (a process known as "[[transduction (genetics)|transduction]]") into ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (E. coli) bacterial cells such as TG1, SS320, ER2738, or XL1-Blue ''E. coli''. If a "[[phagemid]]" [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]] is used (a simplified display construct vector) [[virus|phage particles]] will not be released from the ''E. coli'' cells until they are infected with [[Helper virus|helper phage]], which enables packaging of the phage DNA and assembly of the mature [[virus|virions]] with the relevant protein fragment as part of their outer coat on either the minor (pIII) or major (pVIII) coat protein. 
By immobilizing a relevant DNA or protein target(s) to the surface of a [[microtiter plate]] well, a phage that displays a protein that binds to one of those targets on its surface will remain while others are removed by washing. Those that remain can be [[elution|eluted]], used to produce more phage (by [[bacteria]]l infection with helper phage) and to produce a phage mixture that is enriched with relevant (i.e. binding) phage. The repeated cycling of these steps is referred to as [[Biopanning|'panning']], in reference to the enrichment of a sample of gold by removing undesirable materials.
Phage eluted in the final step can be used to infect a suitable bacterial host, from which the phagemids can be collected and the relevant DNA sequence excised and [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] to identify the relevant, interacting proteins or protein fragments.

The use of a helper phage can be eliminated by using 'bacterial packaging cell line' technology.&lt;ref name="pmid17088290"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chasteen L, Ayriss J, Pavlik P, Bradbury AR | title = Eliminating helper phage from phage display | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 34 | issue = 21 | pages = e145 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17088290 | pmc = 1693883 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elution can be done combining low-pH elution [[buffering agent|buffer]] with sonification, which, in addition to loosening the peptide-target interaction, also serves to detach the target molecule from the immobilization surface. This [[ultrasound]]-based method enables single-step selection of a high-affinity peptide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lunder M, Bratkovič T, Urleb U, Kreft S, Štrukelj B | year = 2009 | title = Ultrasound in phage display: a new approach to nonspecific elution | url = http://www.biotechniques.com/BiotechniquesJournal/2008/June/Ultrasound-in-phage-display-a-new-approach-to-nonspecific-elution/biotechniques-45186.html | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 893–900 | doi = 10.2144/000112759 | pmid = 18533899 | access-date = 2016-05-27 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160804041326/http://www.biotechniques.com/BiotechniquesJournal/2008/June/Ultrasound-in-phage-display-a-new-approach-to-nonspecific-elution/biotechniques-45186.html | archive-date = 2016-08-04 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Applications of phage display technology include determination of interaction partners of a protein (which would be used as the immobilised phage "bait" with a DNA library consisting of all [[coding region|coding sequences]] of a cell, tissue or organism) so that the function or the mechanism of the function of that protein may be determined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060628072224/http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD020763.html Explanation of "Protein interaction mapping" from The Wellcome Trust]&lt;/ref&gt; Phage display is also a widely used method for ''in vitro'' protein evolution (also called [[protein engineering]]). As such, phage display is a useful tool in [[drug discovery]]. It is used for finding new [[ligand]]s (enzyme inhibitors, receptor agonists and antagonists) to target proteins.&lt;ref name="pmid16258189"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lunder M, Bratkovic T, Doljak B, Kreft S, Urleb U, Strukelj B, Plazar N | title = Comparison of bacterial and phage display peptide libraries in search of target-binding motif | journal = Appl.

Competing methods for [[directed evolution|''in vitro'' protein evolution]] include [[yeast display]], [[bacterial display]], [[ribosome display]], and [[mRNA display]].

=== Antibody maturation ''in vitro'' ===
The invention of [[antibody]] phage display revolutionised antibody drug discovery. Initial work was done by laboratories at the [[MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] ([[Greg Winter]] and [[John McCafferty]]), the [[Scripps Research Institute]] (Richard Lerner and Carlos F. Barbas) and the [[German Cancer Research Centre]] (Frank Breitling and Stefan Dübel).&lt;ref name="pmid2247164"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCafferty J, Griffiths AD, Winter G, Chiswell DJ | title = Phage antibodies: filamentous phage displaying antibody variable domains | journal = Nature | volume = 348 | issue = 6301 | pages = 552–4 | date = December 1990 | pmid = 2247164 | doi = 10.1038/348552a0 | bibcode = 1990Natur.348..552M | authorlink4 = David Chiswell | authorlink1 = John McCafferty | authorlink3 = Greg Winter }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-87969-740-7"&gt;{{cite book | author = Scott JS, Barbas CF III, Burton, DA | title = Phage Display: A Laboratory Manual | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | location = Plainview, N.Y | year = 2001 | pages = | isbn = 0-87969-740-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Breitling F, Dübel S, Seehaus T, Klewinghaus I, Little M | title = A surface expression vector for antibody screening | journal = Gene | volume = 104 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–53 | date = August 1991 | pmid = 1916287 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(91)90244-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, The Scripps group reported the first display and selection of human antibodies on phage.&lt;ref name="pmid1896445"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barbas CF, Kang AS, Lerner RA, Benkovic SJ | title = Assembly of combinatorial antibody libraries on phage surfaces: the gene III site | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 88 | issue = 18 | pages = 7978–82 | date = September 1991 | pmid = 1896445 | pmc = 52428 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.88.18.7978 | bibcode = 1991PNAS...88.7978B }}&lt;/ref&gt; This initial study described the rapid isolation of human antibody [[Fragment antigen-binding|Fab]] that bound [[tetanus toxin]] and the method was then extended to rapidly clone human anti-HIV-1 antibodies for vaccine design and therapy.&lt;ref name="pmid1719545"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burton DR, Barbas CF, Persson MA, Koenig S, Chanock RM, Lerner RA | title = A large array of human monoclonal antibodies to type 1 human immunodeficiency virus from combinatorial libraries of asymptomatic seropositive individuals | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 88 | issue = 22 | pages = 10134–7 | date = November 1991 | pmid = 1719545 | pmc = 52882 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.88.22.10134 | bibcode = 1991PNAS...8810134B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1384050"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barbas CF, Björling E, Chiodi F, Dunlop N, Cababa D, Jones TM, Zebedee SL, Persson MA, Nara PL, Norrby E | title = Recombinant human Fab fragments neutralize human type 1 immunodeficiency virus in vitro | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 89 | issue = 19 | pages = 9339–43 | date = October 1992 | pmid = 1384050 | pmc = 50122 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.89.19.9339 | bibcode = 1992PNAS...89.9339B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7973652"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burton DR, Pyati J, Koduri R, Sharp SJ, Thornton GB, Parren PW, Sawyer LS, Hendry RM, Dunlop N, Nara PL | title = Efficient neutralization of primary isolates of HIV-1 by a recombinant human monoclonal antibody | journal = Science | volume = 266 | issue = 5187 | pages = 1024–7 | date = November 1994 | pmid = 7973652 | doi = 10.1126/science.7973652 | bibcode = 1994Sci...266.1024B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7490758"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang WP, Green K, Pinz-Sweeney S, Briones AT, Burton DR, Barbas CF | title = CDR walking mutagenesis for the affinity maturation of a potent human anti-HIV-1 antibody into the picomolar range | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 254 | issue = 3 | pages = 392–403 | date = December 1995 | pmid = 7490758 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.1995.0626 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8170992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barbas CF, Hu D, Dunlop N, Sawyer L, Cababa D, Hendry RM, Nara PL, Burton DR | title = In vitro evolution of a neutralizing human antibody to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 to enhance affinity and broaden strain cross-reactivity | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 91 | issue = 9 | pages = 3809–13 | date = April 1994 | pmid = 8170992 | pmc = 43671 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.91.9.3809 | bibcode = 1994PNAS...91.3809B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phage display of antibody libraries has become a powerful method for both studying the immune response as well as a method to rapidly select and evolve human antibodies for therapy. Antibody phage display was later used by Carlos F. Barbas at The Scripps Research Institute to create synthetic human antibody libraries, a principle first patented in 1990 by Breitling and coworkers (Patent CA 2035384), thereby allowing human antibodies to be created in vitro from synthetic diversity elements.&lt;ref name="pmid1584777"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barbas CF, Bain JD, Hoekstra DM, Lerner RA | title = Semisynthetic combinatorial antibody libraries: a chemical solution to the diversity problem | journal = Proc.

Antibody libraries displaying millions of different antibodies on phage are often used in the pharmaceutical industry to isolate highly specific therapeutic antibody leads, for development into antibody drugs primarily as anti-cancer or anti-inflammatory therapeutics. One of the most successful was [[adalimumab]], discovered by [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]] as D2E7 and developed and marketed by [[Abbott Laboratories]].

== General protocol ==

Below is the sequence of events that are followed in phage display screening to identify polypeptides that bind with high affinity to desired target protein or DNA sequence:
# Target proteins or DNA sequences are immobilized to the wells of a [[microtiter plate]].
# Many genetic sequences are expressed in a [[bacteriophage]] library in the form of fusions with the bacteriophage coat protein, so that they are displayed on the surface of the viral particle. The protein displayed corresponds to the genetic sequence within the phage.
# This phage-display library is added to the dish and after allowing the phage time to bind, the dish is washed.
# Phage-displaying proteins that interact with the target molecules remain attached to the dish, while all others are washed away.
# Attached phage may be [[eluted]] and used to create more phage by infection of suitable bacterial hosts. The new phage constitutes an enriched mixture, containing considerably less irrelevant phage (i.e. non-binding) than were present in the initial mixture.
# Steps 3 to 5 are optionally repeated one or more times, further enriching the phage library in binding proteins. 
# Following further bacterial-based amplification, the DNA within in the interacting phage is sequenced to identify the interacting proteins or protein fragments.

==== pIII ====

pIII is the protein that determines the infectivity of the virion. pIII is composed of three domains (N1, N2 and CT) connected by glycine-rich linkers.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Lowman HB, Clackson T | title = Phage display: a practical approach | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford [Oxfordshire] | year = 2004 | pages = 10–11 | isbn = 0-19-963873-X | chapter =  1.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The N2 domain binds to the F pilus during virion infection freeing the N1 domain which then interacts with a TolA protein on the surface of the bacterium.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt; Insertions within this protein are usually added in position 249 (within a linker region between CT and N2), position 198 (within the N2 domain) and at the N-terminus (inserted between the N-terminal secretion sequence and the N-terminus of pIII).&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt; However, when using the BamHI site located at position 198 one must be careful of the unpaired Cysteine residue (C201) that could cause problems during phage display if one is using a non-truncated version of pIII.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt;

An advantage of using pIII rather than pVIII is that pIII allows for monovalent display when using a phagemid (Ff-phage derived plasmid) combined with a helper phage. Moreover, pIII allows for the insertion of larger protein sequences (&gt;100 amino acids)&lt;ref name="pmid10669603"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sidhu SS, Weiss GA, Wells JA | title = High copy display of large proteins on phage for functional selections | journal = J. Mol. Biol. | volume = 296 | issue = 2 | pages = 487–95 |date=February 2000 | pmid = 10669603 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.1999.3465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is more tolerant to it than pVIII. However, using pIII as the fusion partner can lead to a decrease in phage infectivity leading to problems such as selection bias caused by difference in phage growth rate&lt;ref name="pmid20583018"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Derda R, Tang SK, Whitesides GM | title = Uniform amplification of phage with different growth characteristics in individual compartments consisting of monodisperse droplets | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. | volume = 49 | issue = 31 | pages = 5301–4 |date=July 2010 | pmid = 20583018 | pmc = 2963104 | doi = 10.1002/anie.201001143 | url = https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/13479099/nihms238042.pdf?sequence=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or even worse, the phage's inability to infect its host.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt; Loss of phage infectivity can be avoided by using a phagemid plasmid and a helper phage so that the resultant phage contains both wild type and fusion pIII.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt;

cDNA has also been analyzed using pIII via a two complementary leucine zippers system,&lt;ref name="pmid7957259"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Crameri R, Jaussi R, Menz G, Blaser K | title = Display of expression products of cDNA libraries on phage surfaces.

Biochem. | volume = 226 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–8 |date=November 1994 | pmid = 7957259 | doi = 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.tb20025.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct Interaction Rescue&lt;ref name="pmid7838733"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gramatikoff K, Georgiev O, Schaffner W | title = Direct interaction rescue, a novel filamentous phage technique to study protein-protein interactions | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 22 | issue = 25 | pages = 5761–2 |date=December 1994 | pmid = 7838733 | pmc = 310144 | doi = 10.1093/nar/22.25.5761}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by adding an 8-10 amino acid linker between the cDNA and pIII at the C-terminus.&lt;ref name="pmid11034335"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fuh G, Sidhu SS | title = Efficient phage display of polypeptides fused to the carboxy-terminus of the M13 gene-3 minor coat protein | journal = FEBS Lett. | volume = 480 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 231–4 |date=September 2000 | pmid = 11034335 | doi = 10.1016/s0014-5793(00)01946-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== pVIII ====

pVIII is the main coat protein of Ff phages. Peptides are usually fused to the N-terminus of pVIII.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt; Usually peptides that can be fused to pVIII are 6-8 amino acids long.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt; The size restriction seems to have less to do with structural impediment caused by the added section&lt;ref name="Malik_1998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malik P, Terry TD, Bellintani F, Perham RN | title = Factors limiting display of foreign peptides on the major coat protein of filamentous bacteriophage capsids and a potential role for leader peptidase | journal = FEBS Lett. | volume = 436 | issue = 2 | pages = 263–6 |date=October 1998 | pmid = 9781692 | doi = 10.1016/s0014-5793(98)01140-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more to do with the size exclusion caused by pIV during coat protein export.&lt;ref name="Malik_1998"/&gt; Since there are around 2700 copies of the protein on a typical phages, it is more likely that the protein of interest will be expressed polyvalently even if a phagemid is used.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt; This makes the use of this protein unfavorable for the discovery of high affinity binding partners.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt;

To overcome the size problem of pVIII, artificial coat proteins have been designed.&lt;ref name="Weiss_Sidhu_2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weiss GA, Sidhu SS | title = Design and evolution of artificial M13 coat proteins | journal = J. Mol. Biol. | volume = 300 | issue = 1 | pages = 213–9 |date=June 2000 | pmid = 10864510 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.2000.3845 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is Weiss and Sidhu's inverted artificial coat protein (ACP) which allows the display of large proteins at the C-terminus.&lt;ref name="Weiss_Sidhu_2000"/&gt; The ACP's could display a protein of 20kDa, however, only at low levels (mostly only monovalently).&lt;ref name="Weiss_Sidhu_2000"/&gt;

==== pVI ====

pVI has been widely used for the display of cDNA libraries.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt; The display of cDNA libraries via phage display is an attractive alternative to the yeast-2-hybrid method for the discovery of interacting proteins and peptides due to its high throughput capability.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt; pVI has been used preferentially to pVIII and pIII for the expression of cDNA libraries because one can add the protein of interest to the C-terminus of pVI without greatly affecting pVI's role in phage assembly. This means that the stop codon in the cDNA is no longer an issue.&lt;ref name="pmid9634780"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jespers LS, Messens JH, De Keyser A, Eeckhout D, Van den Brande I, Gansemans YG, Lauwereys MJ, Vlasuk GP, Stanssens PE | title = Surface expression and ligand-based selection of cDNAs fused to filamentous phage gene VI | journal = Bio/Technology | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 378–82 |date=April 1995 | pmid = 9634780 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0495-378}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, phage display of cDNA is always limited by the inability of most prokaryotes in producing post-translational modifications present in eukaryotic cells or by the misfolding of multi-domain proteins.

While pVI has been useful for the analysis of cDNA libraries, pIII and pVIII remain the most utilized coat proteins for phage display.&lt;ref name="Lowman_Clackson_2004"/&gt;

==== pVII and pIX ====

In an experiment in 1995, display of Glutathione S-transferase was attempted on both pVII and pIX and failed.&lt;ref name="pmid7616570"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Endemann H, Model P | title = Location of filamentous phage minor coat proteins in phage and in infected cells | journal = J. Mol. Biol. | volume = 250 | issue = 4 | pages = 496–506 |date=July 1995 | pmid = 7616570 | doi =  10.1006/jmbi.1995.0393}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, phage display of this protein was completed successfully after the addition of a periplasmic signal sequence (pelB or ompA) on the N-terminus.&lt;ref name="pmid10339535"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gao C, Mao S, Lo CH, Wirsching P, Lerner RA, Janda KD | title = Making artificial antibodies: a format for phage display of combinatorial heterodimeric arrays | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 96 | issue = 11 | pages = 6025–30 |date=May 1999 | pmid = 10339535 | pmc = 26829 | doi =  10.1073/pnas.96.11.6025|bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.6025G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent study, it has been shown that AviTag, FLAG and His could be displayed on pVII without the need of a signal sequence.  Then the expression of single chain Fv's (scFv), and single chain T cell receptors (scTCR) were expressed both with and without the signal sequence.&lt;ref name="Løset_2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Løset GÅ, Roos N, Bogen B, Sandlie I | title = Expanding the versatility of phage display II: improved affinity selection of folded domains on protein VII and IX of the filamentous phage | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = e17433 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21390283 | pmc = 3044770 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0017433 |bibcode = 2011PLoSO...617433L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PelB (an amino acid signal sequence that targets the protein to the periplasm where a signal peptidase then cleaves off PelB) improved the phage display level when compared to pVII and pIX fusions without the signal sequence. However, this led to the incorporation of more helper phage genomes rather than phagemid genomes. In all cases, phage display levels were lower than using pIII fusion. However, lower display might be more favorable for the selection of binders due to lower display being closer to true monovalent display. In five out of six occasions, pVII and pIX fusions without pelB was more efficient than pIII fusions in affinity selection assays. The paper even goes on to state that pVII and pIX display platforms may outperform pIII in the long run.&lt;ref name="Løset_2011"/&gt;

The use of pVII and pIX instead of pIII might also be an advantage because virion rescue may be undertaken without breaking the virion-antigen bond if the pIII used is wild type. Instead, one could cleave in a section between the bead and the antigen to elute. Since the pIII is intact it does not matter whether the antigen remains bound to the phage.&lt;ref name="Løset_2011"/&gt;

=== T7 phages ===

The issue of using Ff phages for phage display is that they require the protein of interest to be translocated across the bacterial inner membrane before they are assembled into the phage.&lt;ref name="Danner_Belasco_2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Danner S, Belasco JG | title = T7 phage display: a novel genetic selection system for cloning RNA-binding proteins from cDNA libraries | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 98 | issue = 23 | pages = 12954–9 |date=November 2001 | pmid = 11606722 | pmc = 60806 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.211439598 |bibcode = 2001PNAS...9812954D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some proteins cannot undergo this process and therefore cannot be displayed on the surface of Ff phages. In these cases, T7 phage display is used instead.&lt;ref name="Danner_Belasco_2001"/&gt; In T7 phage display, the protein to be displayed is attached to the C-terminus of the gene 10 capsid protein of T7.&lt;ref name="Danner_Belasco_2001"/&gt;
 
The disadvantage of using T7 is that the size of the  protein that can be expressed on the surface is limited to shorter peptides because large changes to the T7 genome cannot be accommodated like it is in M13 where the phage just makes its coat longer to fit the larger genome within it. However, it can be useful for the production of a large protein library for scFV selection where the scFV is expressed on an M13 phage and the antigens are expressed on the surface of the T7 phage.&lt;ref name="pmid11687245"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Castillo J, Goodson B, Winter J | title = T7 displayed peptides as targets for selecting peptide specific scFvs from M13 scFv display libraries | journal = J. Immunol. Methods | volume = 257 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 117–22 |date=November 2001 | pmid = 11687245 | doi =  10.1016/s0022-1759(01)00454-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bioinformatics resources and tools ==

Databases and computational tools for [[mimotope]]s have been an important part of phage display study.&lt;ref name="pmid21245805"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang J, Ru B, Dai P | title = Bioinformatics resources and tools for phage display | journal = Molecules | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 694–709 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21245805 | doi = 10.3390/molecules16010694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Databases,&lt;ref name="pmid22053087"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang J, Ru B, Zhu P, Nie F, Yang J, Wang X, Dai P, Lin H, Guo FB, Rao N | title = MimoDB 2.0: a mimotope database and beyond | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 40 | issue = Database issue | pages = D271–7 |date=January 2012 | pmid = 22053087 | pmc = 3245166 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; programs and web servers&lt;ref name="PMC2808184"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Negi SS, Braun W | title = Automated Detection of Conformational Epitopes Using Phage Display Peptide Sequences | journal = Bioinform Biol Insights | volume = 3 |pages = 71–81 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20140073 | pmc=2808184}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been widely used to exclude target-unrelated peptides,&lt;ref name="pmid20339521"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang J, Ru B, Li S, Lin H, Guo FB | title = SAROTUP: scanner and reporter of target-unrelated peptides | journal = J.

'''Product engineering''' refers to the process of designing and developing a device, assembly, or system such that it be produced as an item for sale through some production [[manufacturing]] process. Product [[engineering]] usually entails activity dealing with issues of cost, producibility, quality, performance, reliability, serviceability, intended lifespan and user features. These product characteristics are generally all sought in the attempt to make the resulting product attractive to its intended [[Market (economics)|market]] and a successful contributor to the business of the organization that intends to offer the product to that market. It includes design, development and transitioning to manufacturing of the product. The term encompasses developing the concept of the product and the design and development of its mechanical, electronics and [[software]] components. After the initial design and development is done, transitioning the product to manufacture it in volumes is considered part of product engineering.

For example, the engineering of a [[digital camera]] would include defining the feature set, design of the optics, the mechanical and [[ergonomic design]] of the packaging, developing the electronics that control the various component and developing the software that allows the user to see the pictures, store them in memory and download them to a [[computer]]. 

Product engineering is an [[engineering]] discipline that deals with both design and [[manufacturing]] aspects of a product.

==Area of responsibility==

* Product engineers define the yield road map and drive the fulfillment during ramp-up and volume production,
* Identify and realize measures for yield improvement, test optimization and product cost-ability methods,
* Define qualification plan and perform feasibility analysis.

Product engineers are the technical interface between the component development team and the production side (Front End and Back End), especially after the development phase and qualifications when the high volume production is running.

Product engineers improve the product quality and secure the product reliability by balancing the cost of tests and tests coverage that could impact the production fall-off. They support failure analysis request from customers.

==Knowledge and skills==

The job requires the product engineer to have a very good working knowledge of:

* Statistical methods and tools
* Manufacturing process
* Software, hardware and systems implementation 
* Product reliability and qualification
* Physical analysis methods
* [[Computer-aided design]] and simulation programs
* Specific technology
* Strong product Knowledge
* Strong analytic work methodology and problem solving skills
* Continuous Improvement Knowledge

==Tools==
A product engineer will use a wide range of tools and software, possibly including:
20/20, AutoCad, CATIA, PTC Creo, Solidworks, Unigraphics, Labview, JMP, DataConductor.

'''Psychoneuroimmunology''' ('''PNI'''), also referred to as '''psychoendoneuroimmunology''' ('''PENI''') or '''psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology''' ('''PNEI'''), is the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Michael Irwin| first = Kavita Vedhara | title = Human Psychoneuroimmunology| publisher = Oxford University Press|year=2005| isbn = 978-0-19-856884-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/775894214|title=The Oxford handbook of psychoneuroimmunology|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Segerstrom, Suzanne C.|isbn=9780195394399|location=New York|oclc=775894214}}&lt;/ref&gt; PNI takes an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[immunology]], [[physiology]], [[genetics]], [[pharmacology]], [[molecular biology]], [[psychiatry]], [[behavioral medicine]], [[infectious diseases]], [[endocrinology]], and [[rheumatology]].

The main interests of PNI are the interactions between the [[central nervous system|nervous]] and [[immune]] systems and the relationships between mental processes and [[health]]. PNI studies, among other things, the [[physiology|physiological]] functioning of the neuroimmune system in health and disease; disorders of the neuroimmune system ([[autoimmune diseases]]; [[hypersensitivity|hypersensitivities]]; [[immune deficiency]]); and the physical, chemical and physiological characteristics of the components of the neuroimmune system [[in vitro]], [[in situ]], and [[in vivo]].

==History==
Interest in the relationship between psychiatric syndromes or symptoms and immune function has been a consistent theme since the beginning of modern medicine.
[[File:Claude Bernard and his pupils. Oil painting after Léon-Augus Wellcome V0017769.jpg|thumbnail|Claude Bernard, the father of modern physiology, with his pupils]]
[[Claude Bernard]], a French physiologist of the [[Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle]], formulated the concept of the ''[[milieu interieur]]'' in the mid-1800s. In 1865, Bernard described the perturbation of this internal state: "... there are protective functions of organic elements holding living materials in reserve and maintaining without interruption humidity, heat and other conditions indispensable to vital activity. Sickness and death are only a dislocation or perturbation of that mechanism" (Bernard, 1865). [[Walter Cannon]], a professor of physiology at [[Harvard University]] coined the commonly used term, [[homeostasis]], in his book ''The Wisdom of the Body'', 1932, from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word ''homoios'', meaning similar, and ''stasis'', meaning position. In his work with animals, Cannon observed that any change of emotional state in the beast, such as [[anxiety]], [[Distress (medicine)|distress]], or [[rage (emotion)|rage]], was accompanied by total cessation of movements of the stomach (''Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage'', 1915). These studies looked into the relationship between the effects of emotions and perceptions on the [[autonomic nervous system]], namely the [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] responses that initiated the recognition of the [[fight or flight response|freeze, fight or flight response]]. His findings were published from time to time in professional journals, then summed up in book form in ''The Mechanical Factors of Digestion'', published in 1911.

[[Hans Selye]], a student of [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[McGill University]], and a researcher at [[Université de Montréal]], experimented with animals by putting them under different physical and mental adverse conditions and noted that under these difficult conditions the body consistently [[Adaptation|adapted]] to heal and recover. Several years of experimentation that formed the empiric foundation of Selye's concept of the [[General Adaptation Syndrome]]. This syndrome consists of an enlargement of the [[adrenal]] gland, atrophy of the [[thymus]], [[spleen]], and other [[lymphoid]] tissue, and gastric [[Peptic ulcer|ulcerations]].

Selye describes three stages of adaptation, including an initial brief alarm reaction, followed by a prolonged period of resistance, and a terminal stage of exhaustion and death. This foundational work led to a rich line of research on the biological functioning of [[glucocorticoids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Neylan Thomas C | year = 1998 | title = Hans Selye and the Field of Stress Research | url = | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 230 | doi=10.1176/jnp.10.2.230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
In 1975, [[Robert Ader]] and [[Nicholas Cohen]], at the [[University of Rochester]], advanced PNI with their demonstration of [[Classical conditioning|classic conditioning]] of immune function, and they subsequently coined the term "psychoneuroimmunology".&lt;ref&gt;R Ader and N Cohen. [http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/abstract/37/4/333 Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression.] Psychosomatic Medicine, Vol 37, Issue 4 333-340&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roch2"&gt;{{cite news|title = Robert Ader, Founder of Psychoneuroimmunology, Dies|url = http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/index.cfm?id=3370|work = [[University of Rochester Medical Center]]|publisher = |date = 2011-12-20|accessdate = 2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ader was investigating how long conditioned responses (in the sense of [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s conditioning of dogs to drool when they heard a bell ring) might last in laboratory rats. To condition the rats, he used a combination{{clarify|date=July 2013}} of [[saccharin]]-laced water (the conditioned stimulus) and the drug [[Cytoxan]], which unconditionally induces [[nausea and taste aversion]] and suppression of immune function. Ader was surprised to discover that after conditioning, just feeding the rats saccharin-laced water was associated with the death of some animals and he proposed that they had been immunosuppressed after receiving the conditioned stimulus. Ader (a psychologist) and Cohen (an immunologist) directly tested this hypothesis by deliberately immunizing conditioned and unconditioned animals, exposing these and other control groups to the conditioned taste stimulus, and then measuring the amount of antibody produced.  The highly reproducible results revealed that conditioned rats exposed to the conditioned stimulus were indeed immuno suppressed. In other words, a signal via the nervous system (taste) was affecting immune function. This was one of the first scientific experiments that demonstrated that the nervous system can affect the immune system.

In the 1970s, [[Hugo Besedovsky]], [[Adriana del Rey]] and [[Ernst Sorkin]], working in Switzerland, reported multi-directional immune-neuro-endocrine interactions, since they show that not only the brain can influence immune processes but also the immune response itself can affect the brain and neuroendocrine mechanisms. They found that the immune responses to innocuous antigens triggers an increase in the activity of hypothalamic neurons&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Besedovsky|first=H.|last2=Sorkin|first2=E.|last3=Felix|first3=D.|last4=Haas|first4=H.|date=May 1977|title=Hypothalamic changes during the immune response|journal=European Journal of Immunology|volume=7|issue=5|pages=323–325|doi=10.1002/eji.1830070516|issn=0014-2980|pmid=326564}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Besedovsky|first=H.|last2=del Rey|first2=A.|last3=Sorkin|first3=E.|last4=Da Prada|first4=M.|last5=Burri|first5=R.|last6=Honegger|first6=C.|date=1983-08-05|title=The immune response evokes changes in brain noradrenergic neurons|journal=Science|volume=221|issue=4610|pages=564–566|issn=0036-8075|pmid=6867729|doi=10.1126/science.6867729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hormonal and autonomic nerve responses that are  relevant for immunoregulation  and are integrated at brain levels (see review&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Besedovsky|first=Hugo O.|last2=Rey|first2=Adriana Del|date=January 2007|title=Physiology of psychoneuroimmunology: a personal view|journal=Brain, Behavior, and Immunity|volume=21|issue=1|pages=34–44|doi=10.1016/j.bbi.2006.09.008|issn=0889-1591|pmid=17157762}}&lt;/ref&gt;). On these bases, they proposed that the immune system acts as a sensorial receptor organ that, besides its peripheral effects, can communicate to the brain and associated neuro-endocrine structures its state of activity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These investigators also identified products from immune cells, later characterized as cytokines, that mediate this immune-brain communication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Besedovsky|first=H.|last2=del Rey|first2=A.|last3=Sorkin|first3=E.|last4=Dinarello|first4=C.

In 1981, [[David L. Felten]], then working at the [[Indiana University]] School of Medicine, discovered a network of nerves leading to blood vessels as well as cells of the immune system. The researcher, along with his team, also found nerves in the [[thymus]] and [[spleen]] terminating near clusters of [[lymphocyte]]s, [[macrophage]]s, and [[mast cell]]s, all of which help control immune function. This discovery provided one of the first indications of how neuro-immune interaction occurs.

Ader, Cohen, and Felten went on to edit the groundbreaking book ''Psychoneuroimmunology'' in 1981, which laid out the underlying premise that the [[brain]] and immune system represent a single, integrated system of defense.

In 1985, research by [[neuropharmacology|neuropharmacologist]] [[Candace Pert]], of the [[National Institutes of Health]] at [[Georgetown University]], revealed that [[neuropeptide]]-specific receptors are present on the cell walls of both the brain and the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;Pert CB, Ruff MR, Weber RJ, Herkenham M.

Showing that the immune and [[endocrine]] systems are modulated not only by the brain but also by the [[central nervous system]] itself affected the understanding of emotions, as well as disease.

Contemporary advances in [[psychiatry]], immunology, [[neurology]], and other integrated disciplines of medicine has fostered enormous growth for PNI. The mechanisms underlying behaviorally induced alterations of immune function, and immune alterations inducing behavioral changes, are likely to have clinical and therapeutic implications that will not be fully appreciated until more is known about the extent of these interrelationships in normal and pathophysiological states.

==The immune-brain loop==
{{further|Cell signaling networks|Signal transduction}}

PNI research looks for the exact mechanisms by which specific neuroimmune effects are achieved. Evidence for nervous-immunological interactions exist at multiple biological levels.

The immune system and the brain communicate through signaling pathways. The brain and the immune system are the two major adaptive systems of the body. Two major pathways are involved in this cross-talk: the [[Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis), and the [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS), via the [[sympathoadrenal system|sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis]] (SAM axis). The activation of SNS during an immune response might be aimed to localize the inflammatory response.

The body's primary stress management system is the HPA axis. The HPA axis responds to physical and mental challenge to maintain homeostasis in part by controlling the body's [[cortisol]] level. Dysregulation of the HPA axis is implicated in numerous stress-related diseases, with evidence from meta-analyses indicating that different types/duration of stressors and unique personal variables can shape the HPA response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Gregory E.|author2=Chen, Edith |author3=Zhou, Eric S. |title=If it goes up, must it come down? Chronic stress and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in humans|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=January 2007|volume=133|issue=1|pages=25–45|pmid=17201569|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HPA axis activity and cytokines are intrinsically intertwined: inflammatory cytokines stimulate [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) and cortisol secretion, while, in turn, [[glucocorticoids]] suppress the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines.

Molecules called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which include [[interleukin-1]] (IL-1), [[Interleukin-2]] (IL-2), [[interleukin-6]] (IL-6), [[Interleukin-12]] (IL-12), [[Interferon-gamma]] (IFN-Gamma) and [[tumor necrosis factor alpha]] (TNF-alpha) can affect brain growth as well as neuronal function. Circulating immune cells such as [[macrophages]], as well as [[glial]] cells ([[microglia]] and [[astrocytes]]) secrete these molecules. Cytokine regulation of hypothalamic function is an active area of research for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders.&lt;ref name = Covelli&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16029148 | volume=12 | issue=15 | title=Drug targets in stress-related disorders | year=2005 |vauthors=Covelli V, Passeri ME, Leogrande D, Jirillo E, Amati L | pages=1801–9 | journal=Curr. Med. Chem. | doi=10.2174/0929867054367202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cytokines mediate and control [[immune]] and [[inflammation|inflammatory]] responses. Complex interactions exist between cytokines, inflammation and the adaptive responses in maintaining [[homeostasis]]. Like the stress response, the inflammatory reaction is crucial for survival. Systemic inflammatory reaction results in stimulation of four major programs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Elenkov IJ | authorlink5 = Chrousos GP., Iezzoni DG, Daly A, Harris AG, Chrousos GP. | year = 2005 | title = Cytokine dysregulation, inflammation and well-being | url = | journal = Neuroimmunomodulation | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 255–69 | doi=10.1159/000087104 | pmid=16166805}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the acute-phase reaction
* [[sickness behavior]]
* the pain program
* the stress response

These are mediated by the HPA axis and the SNS. Common human diseases such as [[allergy]], autoimmunity, chronic infections and [[sepsis]] are characterized by a dysregulation of the pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory and [[T helper]] (Th1) versus (Th2) cytokine balance.

Recent studies show pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]] processes take place during [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[mania]] and [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] disease, in addition to autoimmune hypersensitivity and chronic infections.

Chronic secretion of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] [[hormones]], [[glucocorticoids]] (GCs) and [[catecholamines]] (CAs), as a result of disease, may reduce the effect of [[neurotransmitters]], including [[serotonin]]{{mcn|date=November 2016}}, [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]], or other receptors in the brain, thereby leading to the dysregulation of neurohormones. Under stimulation, norepinephrine is released from the sympathetic nerve terminals in organs, and the target immune cells express [[adrenergic receptors|adrenoreceptors]]. Through stimulation of these receptors, locally released norepinephrine, or circulating catecholamines such as [[epinephrine]], affect [[lymphocyte]] traffic, circulation, and proliferation, and modulate cytokine production and the functional activity of different [[lymphoid]] cells.

Glucocorticoids also inhibit the further secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone from the [[hypothalamus]] and ACTH from the [[pituitary]] ([[negative feedback]]). Under certain conditions stress hormones may facilitate inflammation through induction of signaling pathways and through activation of the [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone]].

These abnormalities and the failure of the adaptive systems to resolve inflammation affect the well-being of the individual, including behavioral parameters, quality of life and sleep, as well as indices of [[metabolic]] and cardiovascular health, developing into a "systemic anti-inflammatory feedback" and/or "hyperactivity" of the local pro-inflammatory factors which may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease.

This systemic or neuro-inflammation and neuroimmune activation have been shown to play a role in the [[etiology]] of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders such as [[Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], pain, and [[AIDS]]-associated dementia. However, [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s also modulate central nervous system (CNS) function in the absence of overt immunological, physiological, or psychological challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/pa-05-054.html Functional Links between the Immune System, Brain Function and Behavior]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoneuroimmunological effects==
There are now sufficient data to conclude that immune modulation by psychosocial stressors and/or interventions can lead to actual health changes. Although changes related to [[infectious disease]] and [[wound]] healing have provided the strongest evidence to date, the clinical importance of immunological dysregulation is highlighted by increased risks across diverse conditions and diseases. For example, stressors can produce profound health consequences. In one epidemiological study, all-cause mortality increased in the month following a severe stressor – the death of a spouse.&lt;ref name="Kaprio, J. 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kaprio J. |author2=Koskenvuo M. |author3=Rita H. | year = 1987 | title = Mortality after bereavement: a prospective study of 95,647 widowed persons | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 77 | issue = 3| pages = 283–7 | doi=10.2105/ajph.77.3.283|pmc=1646890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists propose that stressful events trigger cognitive and affective responses which, in turn, induce sympathetic nervous system and endocrine changes, and these ultimately impair immune function.&lt;ref name="Chrousos, G.

===Understanding stress and immune function===

[[Stress (medicine)|Stress]] is thought to affect immune function through emotional and/or behavioral manifestations such as [[anxiety]], [[fear]], [[Stress (biology)|tension]], [[anger]] and [[sadness]] and physiological changes such as [[heart rate]], [[blood pressure]], and [[sweating]]. Researchers have suggested that these changes are beneficial if they are of limited duration,&lt;ref name="Chrousos, G. P 1992"/&gt; but when stress is chronic, the system is unable to maintain equilibrium or [[homeostasis]]; the body remains in a state of arousal, where digestion is slower to reactivate or does not reactivate properly, often resulting in indigestion. Furthermore, blood pressure stays at higher levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Psychoneuroimmunology, Mind-Body Psychology and the Fight or Flight Response|last=Chapman|first=Cathy|date=Dec 27, 2010|website=|access-date=Oct 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the earlier PNI studies, which was published in 1960, subjects were led to believe that they had accidentally caused serious injury to a companion through misuse of explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McDonald RD, Yagi K | year = 1960 | title = A note on eosinopenia as an index of psychological stress | url = | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 2 | issue = 22| pages = 149–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then decades of research resulted in two large meta-analyses, which showed consistent immune dysregulation in healthy people who are experiencing stress.

In the first meta-analysis by Herbert and Cohen in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Herbert TB, Cohen S | year = 1993 | title = Stress and immunity in humans: a meta-analytic review | url = | journal = Psychosom. Med. | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 364–379 | doi=10.1097/00006842-199307000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; they examined 38 studies of stressful events and immune function in healthy adults. They included studies of acute laboratory stressors (e.g. a speech task), short-term naturalistic stressors (e.g. medical examinations), and long-term naturalistic stressors (e.g. divorce, bereavement, caregiving, unemployment). They found consistent stress-related increases in numbers of total [[white blood cells]], as well as decreases in the numbers of [[helper T cells]], [[suppressor T cells]], and [[cytotoxic T cells]], [[B cells]], and [[natural killer cell]]s (NK). They also reported stress-related decreases in NK and T cell function, and T cell proliferative responses to [[phytohaemagglutinin]] [PHA] and [[concanavalin A]] [Con A]. These effects were consistent for short-term and long-term naturalistic stressors, but not laboratory stressors.

In the second meta-analysis by Zorrilla et al. in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zorrilla E. P. |author2=Luborsky L. |author3=McKay J. R. |author4=Rosenthal R. |author5=Houldin A. |author6=Tax A. |author7=McCorkle R. |author8=Seligman D.

Using the same study selection procedures, they analyzed 75 studies of stressors and human immunity. Naturalistic stressors were associated with increases in number of circulating [[neutrophils]], decreases in number and percentages of total [[T cells]] and helper T cells, and decreases in percentages of natural killer cell (NK) cells and [[cytotoxic T cell]] lymphocytes. They also replicated Herbert and Cohen's finding of stress-related decreases in NKCC and T cell [[mitogen]] proliferation to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A).

More recently, there has been increasing interest in the links between interpersonal stressors and immune function. For example, marital conflict, loneliness, caring for a person with a chronic medical condition, and other forms on interpersonal stress dysregulate immune function.&lt;ref name = "Ja_review"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Jaremka, L.M. |title=Synergistic relationships among stress, depression, and troubled relationships: Insights from Psychoneuroimmunology |journal=Depression and Anxiety|volume= |pages= |year=in press|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/da.22078/full |accessdate=2013-04-08|doi=10.1002/da.22078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* CRH also regulates the actions of the [[Autonomic nervous system]] ANS and immune system.

Furthermore, stressors that enhance the release of CRH suppress the function of the immune system; conversely, stressors that depress CRH release potentiate immunity.
* Central mediated since peripheral administration of CRH antagonist does not affect immunosuppression.

Extrapolating from the observations that positive emotional experiences boost the immune system, Roberts speculates that intensely positive emotional experiences —sometimes brought about during mystical experiences occasioned by psychedelic medicines—may boost the immune system powerfully. Research on salivary IgA supports this hypothesis, but experimental testing has not been done.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Thomas B. (2006).

'''Radio astronomy''' is a subfield of [[astronomy]] that studies [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] at [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]]. The first detection of radio waves from an astronomical object was in 1932, when [[Karl Jansky]] at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] observed radiation coming from the [[Milky Way]]. Subsequent observations have identified a number of different sources of radio emission. These include [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]], as well as entirely new classes of objects, such as [[Radio galaxy|radio galaxies]], [[quasar]]s, [[pulsar]]s,  and [[Astrophysical maser|masers]]. The discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], regarded as evidence for the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]], was made through radio astronomy.

Radio astronomy is conducted using large [[Antenna (radio)|radio antennas]] referred to as [[radio telescope]]s, that are either used singularly, or with multiple linked telescopes utilizing the techniques of [[Astronomical interferometer|radio interferometry]] and [[aperture synthesis]]. The use of interferometry allows radio astronomy to achieve high [[angular resolution]], as the resolving power of an interferometer is set by the distance between its components, rather than the size of its components.

== History ==
Before Jansky observed the Milky Way in the 1930s, physicists speculated that radio waves could be observed from astronomical sources. In the 1860s, [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s [[Maxwell's equations|equations]] had shown that [[electromagnetic radiation]] is associated with [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], and could exist at any [[wavelength]]. Several attempts were made to detect radio emission from the [[Sun]] including an experiment by German astrophysicists [[Johannes Wilsing]] and [[Julius Scheiner]] in 1896 and a centimeter wave radiation apparatus set up by [[Oliver Lodge]] between 1897-1900. These attempts were unable to detect any emission due to technical limitations of the instruments. The discovery of the radio reflecting [[ionosphere]] in 1902, led physicists to conclude that the layer would bounce any astronomical radio transmission back into space, making them undetectable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nrao.edu/whatisra/hist_prehist.shtml | title = Pre-History of Radio Astronomy | author = F. Ghigo |publisher=[[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] | accessdate = 2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Jansky]] made the discovery of the first astronomical radio source [[Serendipity|serendipitously]] in the early 1930s. As an engineer with [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]], he was investigating static that interfered with [[short wave]] transatlantic voice transmissions. Using a large [[directional antenna]], Jansky noticed that his [[analog signal|analog]] pen-and-paper recording system kept recording a repeating signal of unknown origin. Since the signal peaked about every 24 hours, Jansky originally suspected the source of the interference was the [[Sun]] crossing the view of his directional antenna. Continued analysis showed that the source was not following the 24-hour daily cycle of the Sun exactly, but instead repeating on a cycle of 23 hours and 56 minutes. Jansky discussed the puzzling phenomena with his friend, astrophysicist and teacher Albert Melvin Skellett, who pointed out that the time between the signal peaks was the exact length of a [[sidereal time|sidereal day]]; the time it took for "fixed" astronomical objects, such as a star, to pass in front of the antenna every time the Earth rotated.&lt;ref name="bookrags.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bookrags.com/biography/karl-jansky-wsd/ | title = World of Scientific Discovery on Karl Jansky | accessdate = 2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing his observations with optical astronomical maps, Jansky eventually concluded that the radiation source peaked when his antenna was aimed at the densest part of the  [[Milky Way]] in the [[constellation]] of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/132066a0 | author = Jansky, Karl G. |  title = Radio waves from outside the solar system | journal = Nature | volume = 132 | issue = 3323 | pages = 66 | date = 1933 | bibcode = 1933Natur.132...66J}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that since the Sun (and therefore other stars) were not large emitters of radio noise, the strange radio interference may be generated by interstellar gas and dust in the galaxy.&lt;ref name="bookrags.com"/&gt; (Jansky's peak radio source, one of the brightest in the sky, was designated [[Sagittarius A]] in the 1950s and, instead of being galactic "gas and dust", was later hypothesized to be emitted by [[electrons]] in a strong magnetic field. Current thinking is that these are ions in orbit around a massive [[Black hole]] at the center of the galaxy at a point now designated as Sagitarius A*. The asterisk indicates that the particles at Sagitarius A are ionized.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Relativity, Astrophysics and Cosmology: Volume 1 |last=Belusević |first=R. |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WeICTHIxP2MC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=Jansky+%22center+of+the+galaxy%22+%22sagittarius+A%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Er-nT4zTDYfn0QGA8-n5BA&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Jansky%20%22center%20of%20the%20galaxy%22%20%22sagittarius%20A%22&amp;f=false |page=163 |publisher=[[Wiley-VCH]] |isbn=978-3527407644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kambič |first=B. |year= |title=Viewing the Constellations with Binoculars |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3vxLNPNHOcwC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=jansky+strongest+%22Sagittarius+A%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xeSnT7r_MsOT0QHk482XBQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=jansky%20strongest%20%22Sagittarius%20A%22&amp;f=false |pages=131–133 |publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]] |isbn=978-0387853550}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gillessen | first1 = S. | last2 = Eisenhauer | first2 = F. | last3 = Trippe | first3 = S. | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2009 | title = Monitoring Stellar Orbits around the Massive Black Hole in the Galactic Center | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 692 | issue = 2| pages = 1075–1109 | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/692/2/1075 | arxiv=0810.4674 | bibcode=2009ApJ...692.1075G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = R.

Jansky announced his discovery in 1933. He wanted to investigate the radio waves from the Milky Way in further detail, but Bell Labs reassigned him to another project, so he did no further work in the field of astronomy. His pioneering efforts in the field of radio astronomy have been recognized by the naming of the fundamental unit of [[flux density]], the [[jansky]] (Jy), after him.

[[Grote Reber]] was inspired by Jansky's work, and built a parabolic radio telescope 9m in diameter in his backyard in 1937. He began by repeating Jansky's observations, and then conducted the first sky survey in the radio frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nrao.edu/whatisra/hist_reber.shtml | title = Grote Reber | accessdate = 2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 27, 1942, [[James Stanley Hey]], a [[British Army]] research officer, made the first detection of radio waves emitted by the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hey |first=J.

[[File:GBT.png|thumb|The Robert C. Byrd [[Green Bank Telescope]] (GBT) in [[West Virginia]], United States is the world's largest fully steerable radio telescope.]]At [[Cambridge University]], where ionospheric research had taken place during [[World War II]], [[J.A. Ratcliffe]] along with other members of the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] that had carried out wartime research into [[radar]], created a radiophysics group at the university where radio wave emissions from the Sun were observed and studied.
This early research soon branched out into the observation of other celestial radio sources and interferometry techniques were pioneered to isolate the angular source of the detected emissions. [[Martin Ryle]] and [[Antony Hewish]] at the [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group]] developed the technique of Earth-rotation [[aperture synthesis]]. The radio astronomy group in Cambridge went on to found the [[Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory]] near Cambridge in the 1950s. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, as computers (such as the [[Titan (computer)|Titan]]) became capable of handling the computationally intensive [[Fourier transform]] inversions required, they used aperture synthesis to create a 'One-Mile' and later a '5&amp;nbsp;km' effective aperture using the One-Mile and Ryle telescopes, respectively. They used the [[Cambridge Interferometer]] to map the radio sky, producing the famous [[Second Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources|2C]] and [[Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources|3C]] surveys of radio sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/history/years/radioast.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110022209/http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/history/years/radioast.php|archivedate=2013-11-10|title=Radio Astronomy|publisher=Cambridge University: Department of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
[[File:First 7-metre ALMA Antenna.jpg|thumb|First 7-metre [[ESO]]/NAOJ/NRAO [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] Antenna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First 7-metre ALMA Antenna Arrives at Chajnantor|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1135a/|accessdate=1 September 2011|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week|date=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Radio astronomers use different techniques to observe objects in the radio spectrum. Instruments may simply be pointed at an energetic radio source to analyze its emission. To “image” a region of the sky in more detail, multiple overlapping scans can be recorded and pieced together in a [[mosaic]] image. The type of instrument used depends on the strength of the signal and the amount of detail needed.

Observations from the [[Earth]]'s surface are limited to wavelengths that can pass through the atmosphere. At low frequencies, or long wavelengths, transmission is limited by the [[ionosphere]], which reflects waves with frequencies less than its characteristic [[plasma frequency]]. [[Water]] [[vapor]] interferes with radio astronomy at higher frequencies, which has led to building radio observatories that conduct observations at [[millimeter]] wavelengths at very high and dry sites, in order to minimize the water vapor content in the line of sight. Finally, transmitting devices on earth may cause [[radio-frequency interference]]. Because of this, many radio observatories are built at remote places.

===Radio telescopes===

The jet of particles is suspected to be powered by a [[black hole]] in the center of the galaxy.]]
Radio telescopes may need to be extremely large in order to receive signals with high [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. Also since [[angular resolution]] is a function of the diameter of the "[[Objective (optics)|objective]]" in proportion to the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation being observed,  ''[[radio telescope]]s'' have to be much larger in comparison to their [[Optical telescope|optical]] counterparts. For example, a 1-meter diameter optical telescope is two million times bigger than the wavelength of light observed giving it a resolution of roughly 0.3 [[arc second]]s, whereas a radio telescope "dish" many times that size may, depending on the wavelength observed, only be able to resolve an object the size of the full moon (30 minutes of arc).

===Radio interferometry===
{{main|Astronomical interferometry}}
{{see also|Radio telescope#Radio interferometry}}
The difficulty in achieving high resolutions with single radio telescopes led to radio [[interferometry]], developed by British radio astronomer  [[Martin Ryle]] and Australian engineer, radiophysicist, and radio astronomer [[Joseph Lade Pawsey]] and [[Ruby Payne-Scott]] in 1946. Surprisingly the first use of a radio interferometer for an astronomical observation was carried out by Payne-Scott, Pawsey and [[Lindsay McCready]] on 26 January 1946 using a SINGLE converted radar antenna (broadside array) at [[Very high frequency|200 MHz]] near [[Sydney, Australia]]. This group used the principle of a sea-cliff interferometer in which the antenna (formerly a World War II radar) observed the sun at sunrise with interference arising from the direct radiation from the sun and the reflected radiation from the sea. With this baseline of almost 200 meters, the authors determined that the solar radiation during the burst phase was much smaller than the solar disk and arose from a region associated with a large [[sunspot]] group. The Australia group laid out the principles of [[aperture synthesis]] in a ground-breaking paper published in 1947. The use of a sea-cliff [[interferometer]] had been demonstrated by numerous groups in Australia, Iran and the UK during World War II, who had observed interference fringes (the direct radar return radiation and the reflected signal from the sea) from incoming aircraft.
 
The Cambridge group of Ryle and Vonberg observed the sun at 175&amp;nbsp;MHz for the first time in mid July 1946 with a Michelson interferometer consisting of two radio antennas with spacings of some tens of meters up to 240 meters. They showed that the radio radiation was smaller than 10 [[Minute of arc|arc minutes]] in size and also detected circular polarization in the Type I bursts. Two other groups had also detected circular polarization at about the same time ([[David Martyn (scientist)|David Martyn]] in Australia and [[Edward Victor Appleton|Edward Appleton]] with [[James Stanley Hey]] in the UK).

Modern [[Radio telescope#Radio interferometry|Radio interferometers]] consist of widely separated radio telescopes observing the same object that are connected together using [[coaxial cable]], [[waveguide]], [[optical fiber]], or other type of [[transmission line]]. This not only increases the total signal collected, it can also be used in a process called [[Aperture synthesis]] to vastly increase resolution. This technique works by superposing ("[[Interference (wave propagation)|interfering]]") the signal [[wave]]s from the different telescopes on the principle that [[wave]]s that coincide with the same [[phase (waves)|phase]] will add to each other while two waves that have opposite phases will cancel each other out. This creates a combined telescope that is the size of the antennas furthest apart in the array. In order to produce a high quality image, a large number of different separations between different telescopes are required (the projected separation between any two telescopes as seen from the radio source is called a "baseline") - as many different baselines as possible are required in order to get a good quality image. For example, the [[Very Large Array]] has 27 telescopes giving 351 independent baselines at once.

====Very-long-baseline interferometry====
{{main|Very-long-baseline interferometry}}
[[File:Mt Pleasant radio telescope night.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory|Mount Pleasant Radio Telescope]] is the southern most antenna used in Australia's VLBI network]]
Beginning in the 1970s, improvements in the stability of radio telescope receivers permitted telescopes from all over the world (and even in Earth orbit) to be combined to perform [[very-long-baseline interferometry]]. Instead of physically connecting the antennas, data received at each antenna is paired with timing information, usually from a local [[atomic clock]], and then stored for later analysis on magnetic tape or hard disk. At that later time, the data is correlated with data from other antennas similarly recorded, to produce the resulting image. Using this method it is possible to synthesise an antenna that is effectively the size of the Earth. The large distances between the telescopes enable very high angular resolutions to be achieved, much greater in fact than in any other field of astronomy. At the highest frequencies, synthesised beams less than 1 [[Minute of arc|milliarcsecond]] are possible.

The pre-eminent VLBI arrays operating today are the [[Very Long Baseline Array]] (with telescopes located across North America) and the [[European VLBI Network]] (telescopes in Europe, China, South Africa and Puerto Rico). Each array usually operates separately, but occasional projects are observed together producing increased sensitivity. This is referred to as Global VLBI. There are also a VLBI networks, operating in Australia and New Zealand called the LBA (Long Baseline Array),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atnf.csiro.au/vlbi/&lt;/ref&gt; and arrays in Japan, China and South Korea which observe together to form the East-Asian VLBI Network (EAVN).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astro.sci.yamaguchi-u.ac.jp/eavn/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, recording data onto hard media was the only way to bring the data recorded at each telescope together for later correlation. However, the availability today of worldwide, high-bandwidth networks makes it possible to do VLBI in real time. This technique (referred to as e-VLBI) was originally pioneered in Japan, and more recently adopted in Australia and in Europe by the EVN (European VLBI Network) who perform an increasing number of scientific e-VLBI projects per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/physics_astronomy/report-25117.html A technological breakthrough for radio astronomy - Astronomical observations via high-speed data link&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio astronomy has led to substantial increases in astronomical knowledge, particularly with the discovery of several classes of new objects, including [[pulsar]]s, [[quasar]]s&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shields|first1=Gregory A.|title=A brief history of AGN |journal=The Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|date=1999|volume=111|issue=760|pages=661–678|accessdate=3 October 2014|URL=http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Shields/Shields3.html|doi=10.1086/316378|arxiv = astro-ph/9903401 |bibcode = 1999PASP..111..661S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[radio galaxy|radio galaxies]]. This is because radio astronomy allows us to see things that are not detectable in optical astronomy.  Such objects represent some of the most extreme and energetic physical processes in the universe.

The [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] was also first detected using radio telescopes. However, radio telescopes have also been used to investigate objects much closer to home, including observations of the [[Sun]] and solar activity, and radar mapping of the [[solar system|planets]].

Other sources include:
* [[Sun]]
* [[Jupiter]]
* [[Sagittarius A]], the [[galactic center]] of the [[Milky Way]], with one portion [[Sagittarius A*]] thought to be a radio wave emitting [[supermassive black hole]]
* [[Active galactic nucleus|Active galactic nuclei]] and [[pulsar]]s have jets of charged particles which emit [[synchrotron radiation]]
* Merging [[galaxy cluster]]s often show diffuse radio emission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arcetri.astro.it/~buttery/thesis/node69.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060128231925/http://www.arcetri.astro.it/~buttery/thesis/node69.html |archivedate=2006-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Supernova remnant]]s can also show diffuse radio emission; [[pulsar]]s are a type of supernova remnant that shows highly synchronous emission.
* The [[cosmic microwave background]] is [[blackbody]] radio/microwave emission

As its name implies, this species of [[crocodile]] can live in marine environments, but usually resides in saline and brackish [[mangrove swamp]]s, [[estuaries]], [[river delta|delta]]s, [[lagoon]]s, and lower stretches of [[river]]s. They have the broadest [[Range (biology)|distribution]] of any modern crocodile, ranging from the eastern coast of India throughout most of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. Historically, the range covered Southern China as well.

===Possible subspecies and status as a species complex===
Currently, most sources state that the saltwater crocodile does not have subspecies.&lt;ref name= Brazaitis&gt;Brazaitis, P. (2001). ''A Guide to the Identification of the Living Species of Crocodilians''. Wildlife Conservation Society.&lt;/ref&gt; However, based largely on morphological variability, some have claimed that not only are there subspecies but that ''C. porosus'' actually houses a [[species complex]]. In 1844, S. Müller and H. Schlegel attempted to describe crocodiles from [[Java]] and [[Borneo]] as a new species which they named ''C. raninus'', subsequently given the informal common names of the Indonesian crocodile or Bornean crocodile. According to Ross (1992), specimens of ''C. raninus'' can reliably be distinguished both from Siamese crocodiles and true saltwater crocodiles on the basis of the number ventral scales and on the presence of four postoccipital scutes which are often absent in true saltwater crocodiles.&lt;ref name= Naish/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ross, C.A.|year= 1990|title= ''Crocodylus raninus'' S.

The type specimen reported for this so-called species was a crocodile nicknamed "Sweetheart" that was inadvertently killed in 1979 (drowned after being overly-anesthetized in an attempt to relocate it after it had taken to attacking boats). However, this "species", ''C. pethericki'', has later been largely considered as a misinterpretation of the physiological changes undergone by very large male crocodiles. However, Wells and Wellington's assertion that the Australian saltwater crocodiles may at least be distinctive enough from northern Asian saltwater crocodiles to warrant subspecies status, as could ''raninus'' from other Asian saltwater crocodiles, has been considered to possibly bear validity.&lt;ref name= Naish/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wells, R.W. |author2=Wellington, C.R. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1985|title=A classification of the Amphibia and Reptilia of Australia|journal= Australian Journal of Herpetology|volume= Suppl.

[[File:Crocodile Crocodylus-porosus amk2.jpg|left|thumb|Head of a saltwater crocodile]]
The saltwater crocodile has a wide snout compared to most crocodiles. However, it has a longer [[snout|muzzle]] than the [[mugger crocodile]]; its length is twice its width at the base.&lt;ref name="Guggisberg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Guggisberg |first=C.A.W. |title=Crocodiles: Their Natural History, Folklore, and Conservation |year=1972 |page=195 |location=Newton Abbot |publisher=David &amp; Charles |isbn=978-0-7153-5272-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The saltwater crocodile has fewer armour plates on its neck than other crocodilians. On this species, a pair of ridges runs from the eyes along the centre of the snout. The scales are oval in shape and the [[scute]]s are either small compared to other species or commonly are entirely absent. In addition, an obvious gap is also present between the cervical and dorsal shields, and small, triangular scutes are present between the posterior edges of the large, transversely arranged scutes in the dorsal shield. The relative lack of scutes is considered an asset useful to distinguish saltwater crocodiles in captivity or in illicit leather trading, as well as in the few areas in the field where sub-adult or younger saltwater crocodiles may need to be distinguished from other crocodiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kondo |first=H. |year=1970 |title = Grolier's Amazing World of Reptiles |location=New York, NY |publisher=Grolier Interprises Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross, F.

The adult saltwater crocodile's broad body contrasts with that of most other lean crocodiles, leading to early unverified assumptions the reptile was an [[alligator]].&lt;ref name="ufl"/&gt; The head is very large. The largest skull size that could be scientifically verified was for a specimen in the [[Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle]] sourced to [[Cambodia]]: the skull length for this specimen was {{convert|76|cm|in|abbr=on}} (female skull lengths of over {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}} are exceptional), with a mandibular length of {{convert|98.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a maximum width across the skull (near the base) of {{convert|48|cm|in|abbr=on}}.

Young saltwater crocodiles are pale yellow in colour with black stripes and spots on their bodies and tails. This colouration lasts for several years until the crocodiles mature into adults. The colour as an adult is much darker greenish-drab, with a few lighter tan or grey areas sometimes apparent. Several colour variations are known and some adults may retain fairly pale skin, whereas others may be so dark as to appear blackish. The ventral surface is white or yellow in colour on saltwater crocodiles of all ages. Stripes are present on the lower sides of their bodies, but do not extend onto their bellies. Their tails are grey with dark bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lanworn |first=R. |year=1972 |title=The Book of Reptiles |location=New York, NY |publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group Ltd. |isbn=978-0600312734}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reptilianzone.com/saltwater-crocodile/ |title=Crocodylus porosus |publisher=ReptilianZone.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The saltwater crocodile has been extirpated from much of its former range within the [[Philippines]] and currently populations remain in only a few scattered locations. On the island of [[Mindanao]] the species is present within the Ligawasan Marsh and adjacent waterways in the southwest of the island and also within the Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary in the eastern portion of the island, where in September 2011 a 20.24 foot/6.17 meter saltwater crocodile, the largest reliably measured, was captured by locals following two fatal attacks. This species is also reported to be found within the mangroves of Languyan Island of the Tawi-Tawi province southwest of Mindanao and within the mangroves of Del Carmen municipality on Siargao Island northeast of Mindanao. On Luzon Island the species has been reported from three areas in the northeast: the Blos River of barangay Reina Mercedes, the Divilacan mangroves of barangay Dimasalansan and the Palanan River estuary of barangay Culasi. On the island of Palawan the species appears to remain within only the southern portion of the country and in recent years, attacks on humans have occurred within the Rio Tuba area near Bataraza on the southeast coast and from near Rizal on the southeastern coast. The species is also reported to be present within the islands of the Balabac Strait between the island of Palawan and the Malaysian Borneo state of Sabah. The status of the species within Naujan Lake on the island of Mindoro is unclear; crocodile eye-shines have been spotted in recent years and these are believed to belong to the saltwater crocodile, but it is unknown whether a viable population remains.

Because of its tendency to travel very long distances at sea, individual saltwater crocodiles have been known to appear occasionally in areas far away from their general range. Vagrant individuals have historically been reported on [[New Caledonia]], [[Fiji]], and in Asian waters possibly swam with [[Kuroshio Current]],&lt;ref name=ecolumn /&gt; reaching such as at [[Iwo Jima]], [[Hachijō-jima]], [[Amami Ōshima]], [[Iriomote-jima]] (residences by several individuals along [[Urauchi River]] from [[Bakumatsu]] to [[Meiji period|Meiji]] until being hunted by locals were suggested){{explain|date=October 2016|reason=I suspect poor translation from the Japanese.}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ankei.jp/yuji/file/0503/000075_1.pdf|title=西表島浦内川河口域の生物多様性と伝統的自然資源利用の綜合調査報告書１|author=|date=|website=ankei.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; pelagic waters off [[Shima, Mie]], [[Miura Peninsula]],&lt;ref name=ecolumn&gt;https://ecolumn.net/iriewani.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and even in the relatively frigid [[Sea of Japan]] (thousands of miles from their native territory.)&lt;ref name= Kumar&gt;{{cite book|author=Kumar, A. |author2=Kumar, S. |author3=Zaidi, Y.

These crocodiles did indeed migrate south to the island from northern Queensland during the warmer [[wet season]] and presumably returned to the north upon the seasonal temperature drop. Despite the surprise and shock within the Fraser Island public, this is apparently not new behaviour, and in the distant past, wild crocodiles had been reported appearing occasionally as far south as [[Brisbane]] during the warmer wet season.

Saltwater crocodiles generally spend the tropical wet season in freshwater swamps and rivers, moving downstream to estuaries in the dry season, and sometimes travelling far out to sea. Crocodiles compete fiercely with each other for territory, with dominant males in particular occupying the most eligible stretches of freshwater creeks and streams. Junior crocodiles are thus forced into the more marginal river systems and sometimes into the ocean. This explains the large distribution of the animal (ranging from the east coast of India to northern Australia), as well as its being found in the odd places on occasion (such as the Sea of Japan). Like all crocodiles, they can survive for prolonged periods in only warm temperatures, and crocodiles seasonally vacate parts of Australia if cold spells hit.&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite book|title=Crocodiles and Alligators |editor1-last=Ross |editor1-first=Charles A |editor2-last=Garnett |editor2-first=Stephen |publisher=Checkmark Books |year=1989 |isbn=978-0816021741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology and behaviour==
[[File:Crocodylus porosus foraging in surf at Maconacon - ZooKeys-266-001-g104-bottom.jpg|thumb|A saltwater crocodile off [[Maconacon, Isabela|Maconacon]], [[Isabela (province)]] in the [[Philippines]]]]
The primary behaviour to distinguish the saltwater crocodile from other [[crocodile]]s is its tendency to occupy salt water. Though other crocodiles also have [[salt gland]]s that enable them to survive in saltwater, a trait which alligators do not possess, most other species do not venture out to sea except during extreme conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt-Nielsen, K. (1997). ''Animal physiology: adaptation and environment''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The only other species to display regular seagoing behaviour is the [[American crocodile]] (''C. acutus''), but the American version is still not considered to be as marine-prone as the saltwater crocodile. As its alternate name "sea-going crocodile" implies, this species travels between areas separated by sea, or simply relies on the relative ease of travelling through water in order to circumvent long distances on the same land mass, such as Australia. In a similar fashion to [[migratory bird]]s using [[thermal column]]s, saltwater crocodiles use [[ocean current]]s to travel long distances.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10260382 |title=BBC News – Crocodiles 'surf' long distance on ocean currents |last=Moskvitch |first=Katia |date=7 June 2010 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study, 20 crocodiles were tagged with [[Animal migration tracking|satellite transmitter]]s; 8 of these crocodiles ventured out into [[open ocean]], in which one of them travelled {{convert|590|km|mi|abbr=on}} along the coast – from the North Kennedy River on eastern coast of [[Far North Queensland]], around [[Cape York Peninsula]], to the west coast in the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] – in 25 days.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Another specimen, a {{convert|4.84|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}}-long male, travelled {{convert|411|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 20 days. Without having to move around much, sometimes simply by floating, the current-riding behaviour allows for the conservation of energy. They will even interrupt their travels, residing in sheltered bays for a few days, when the current is against the desired direction of travel, until the current changes direction.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Saltwater crocodiles also travel up and down in [[river system]]s, periodically.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

[[File:Saltwater Crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) (8851850268).jpg|thumb|left|An adult saltwater crocodile swimming through a swamp.]]

While most crocodilians are social animals sharing basking spots and food, saltwater crocodiles are more [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and are less tolerant of their own kind; adult males will share territory with females, but drive off rival males. Saltwater crocodiles mate in the wet season, laying [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s in a nest consisting of a mound of mud and vegetation. The female guards the [[nest]] and [[hatchling]]s from predators.

Generally very [[lethargy|lethargic]], a trait which helps it survive months at a time without food, the saltwater crocodile will usually loiter in the water or bask in the sun during much of the day, preferring to hunt at night. A study of seasonal saltwater crocodile behaviour in Australia indicated that they are more active and more likely to spend time in the water during the Australian summer; conversely, they are less active and spend relatively more time basking in the sun during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0504 |pmc=1689355|title=Thermal relations of large crocodiles, Crocodylus porosus, free-ranging in a naturalistic situation|year=1998|last1=Grigg|first1=G.

They are much less [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] than most species of crocodiles, spending less time on land except for [[Thermoregulation|basking]]. At times, they tend to spend weeks at sea in search of land and in some cases, [[barnacle]]s have been observed growing on crocodile scales, indicative of the long periods they spend at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wallawalla.edu/academics/departments/biology/rosario/inverts/Arthropoda/Crustacea/Maxillopoda/Cirripedia/Lepas_anatifera.html |title=''Lepas anatifera'' Linnaeus, 1758 |publisher=WallaWalla |accessdate=2 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018081738/http://www.wallawalla.edu/academics/departments/biology/rosario/inverts/Arthropoda/Crustacea/Maxillopoda/Cirripedia/Lepas_anatifera.html |archivedate=18 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their relative lethargy, saltwater crocodiles are agile predators and display surprising agility and speed when necessary, usually during strikes at prey. They are capable of explosive bursts of speed when launching an attack from the water. They can also swim at {{convert|15|to|18|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in short bursts, around three times as fast as the fastest human swimmers, but when cruising, they usually go at {{convert|2|to|3|mph|km/h|1|abbr=on}}. However, stories of crocodiles being faster than a race horse for short distances across land are little more than urban legend. At the water's edge, however, where they can combine propulsion from both feet and tail, their speed can be explosive.

While crocodilian brains are much smaller than those of mammals (as low as 0.05% of body weight in the saltwater crocodile), saltwater crocodiles are capable of learning difficult tasks with very little conditioning, learning to track the migratory route of their prey as the seasons change, and may possess a deeper communication ability than currently accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crocodilian.com/big-gecko |title=Big Gecko – Crocodile Management, Research and Filming |publisher=Crocodilian.com |accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crocodilian.com/cnhc/croccomm.html |title=Crocodile Communication: Crocodiles, Caimans, Alligators, Gharials |publisher=Flmnh.ufl.edu |date=5 March 1996 |accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hunting and diet===
[[File:Crocodile in Broome Western Australia.jpg|thumb|Feeding young adult in captivity, Western Australia]]
Like most species in the crocodilians family, saltwater crocodiles are not fastidious in their choice of food, and readily vary their [[prey]] selection according to availability, nor are they voracious, as they are able to survive on relatively little food for a prolonged period. Because of their size and distribution, saltwater crocodiles hunt the broadest range of prey species of any modern crocodilian.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt; The diet of hatchling, juvenile and subadult saltwater crocodiles has been subject to extensively greater scientific study than that of fully-grown crocodiles, in large part due to the aggression, territoriality and size of adults which make them difficult for biologists to handle without significant risk to safety, for both humans and the crocodiles themselves; the main method used for capturing adult saltwater crocodiles is a huge pole with large hooks meant for shark capture which restrict the crocodile's jaws but can cause damage to their snouts and even this is unproven to allow successful capture for crocodiles in excess of {{convert|4|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}}.

The space for the jaw muscle in the [[skull]] is very large, which is easily visible from the outside as a bulge at each side. The nature of the [[muscle]] is extremely stiff, almost as hard as bone to the touch, such that it can appear to be the continuum of the skull. Another trait is that most of the muscle in a crocodile's jaw is arranged for clamping down. Despite the strong muscles to close the jaw, crocodiles have extremely small and weak muscles to open the jaw. The jaws of a crocodile can be securely shut with several layers of [[duct tape]].&lt;ref&gt;Cogger, H.G. (1996). ''Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia''. Chatswood, NSW: Reed Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saltwater crocodiles mate in the wet season, when water levels are at their highest.

Nests are often in a surprisingly exposed location, often in mud with little to no vegetation around, and thus limited protection from the sun and wind. The nest is a mound of mud and vegetation, usually measuring {{convert|175|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|53|cm|in|abbr=on}} high, with an entrance averaging {{convert|160|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref name= Messel/&gt; Some nests in unlikely habitats have occurred, such as rocky rubble or in a damp low-grass field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Somaweera, R. |author2=Shine, R. |year=2013|title=Nest-site selection by crocodiles at a rocky site in the Australian tropics: Making the best of a bad lot|journal=Austral Ecology|volume=38|issue=3|pages=313–325|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.2012.02406.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Magnusson, W.

As in all crocodilian species, the female saltwater crocodile exhibits a remarkable level of maternal care for a reptile. She excavates the nest in response to "yelping" calls from the hatchlings, and even gently rolls eggs in her mouth to assist hatching. The female will then carry the hatchlings to water in her mouth (as [[Nile crocodile#Reproduction|Nile crocodile]] and [[American alligator#Reproduction|American alligator]] females have been observed doing when their eggs hatch) and remains with the young for several months.

==Conservation status==
[[File:Saltwater crocodile.jpg|thumb|Saltwater crocodile]]

The species is considered of minimal concern for extinction. Currently, the species is listed in [[CITES]] as follows:
* Appendix I (prohibiting all commercial trade in the species or its byproducts): All wild populations except for those of Australia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea;
* Appendix II (commercial trade allowed with export permit; import permits may or may not be required depending on the laws of the importing country): Australia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea wild populations, plus all worldwide populations bred in captivity for commercial purposes.

The saltwater crocodile was often hunted for its meat and eggs, and its skin is the most commercially valuable of any crocodilian. Unregulated hunting during the 20th century caused a dramatic decline in the species throughout its range, with the population in northern Australia reduced by 95% by 1971. The years from 1940 to 1970 were the peak of unregulated hunting and may have regionally caused irreparable damage to saltwater crocodile populations.&lt;ref name="Whitaker2"/&gt; The species currently has full legal protection in all Australian states and territories where it is found – Western Australia (since 1970), Northern Territory (since 1971) and Queensland (since 1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1774 |title=Crocodylus porosus – Salt-water Crocodile, Estuarine Crocodile |publisher=Environment.gov.au |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illegal hunting still persists in some areas, with protection in some countries being grossly ineffective, and trade is often difficult to monitor and control over such a vast range. However, many areas have not recovered; some population surveys have shown that although young crocodiles are present, fewer than 10% of specimens spotted are in adult size range and include no particularly large males, such as [[Sri Lanka]] or the [[Republic of Palau]]. This is indicative of both potential continued persecution and exploitation and a non-recovered breeding population.&lt;ref&gt;Gramantez, D.

Proceedings of the 11th Working Meeting of the Crocodile Specialist Group .&lt;/ref&gt;

Habitat loss continues to be a major problem for the species. In northern Australia, much of the nesting habitat of the saltwater crocodile is susceptible to trampling by feral water buffalo, although buffalo eradication programs have now reduced this problem considerably. Even where large areas of suitable habitat remain, subtle habitat alterations can be a problem, such as in the [[Andaman Islands]], where freshwater areas, used for nesting, are being increasingly converted to human agriculture. After the commercial value of crocodile skins waned, perhaps the greatest immediate challenge to implementing conservation efforts has been the occasional danger the species can pose to humans, and the resulting negative view of the crocodile.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/cnhc/csp_cpor.htm |title=Crocodilian Species – Australian Saltwater Crocodile (''Crocodylus porosus'') |publisher=Flmnh.ufl.edu |accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tisdell, C. |author2=Nantha, H.

==Relationship with humans==

===Attacks on humans===
Of all the crocodilians, the saltwater crocodile has the strongest tendency to treat humans as prey, and has a long history of attacking humans who unknowingly venture into its territory. As a result of its power, intimidating size and speed, survival of a direct predatory attack is unlikely if the crocodile is able to make direct contact. By contrast to the American policy of encouraging a certain degree of habitat coexistence with alligators, the only recommended policy for dealing with saltwater crocodiles is to completely avoid their habitat whenever possible, as they are exceedingly aggressive when encroached upon.&lt;ref name="Guggisberg"/&gt;

IUCN, Gland, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; Some attacks on humans appear to be territorial rather than predatory in nature, with crocodiles over two years in age often attacking anything that comes into their area (including boats). Humans can usually escape alive from such encounters, which comprise about half of all attacks. Non-fatal attacks usually involve crocodiles of {{convert|3|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}} or less in length. Fatal attacks, more likely to be predatory in motivation, commonly involve larger crocodiles with an average estimated size of {{convert|4.3|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}}. Under normal circumstances, [[Nile crocodile]]s are believed to be responsible for a considerably greater number of fatal attacks on humans than saltwater crocodiles, but this may have more to do with the fact that many people in Africa tend to rely on riparian areas for their livelihood, which is less prevalent in most of Asia and certainly less so in Australia.&lt;ref name= AttackResearch/&gt; In the [[Andaman Islands]], the number of fatal attacks on humans has reportedly increased, the reason inferred due to habitat destruction and reduction of natural prey.&lt;ref&gt;Sivaperuman, C.

During the Japanese retreat in the [[Battle of Ramree Island]] on 19 February 1945, saltwater crocodiles may have been responsible for the deaths of over 400 Japanese soldiers.

The species has featured in contemporary Australian film and television including the [["Crocodile" Dundee]] series of films and [[The Crocodile Hunter]] television series. There are now several saltwater crocodile-themed parks in Australia.

The crocodile is considered to be holy on [[Timor]]. According to legend, the island was formed by a giant crocodile. The [[Papuan people]] have a similar and very involved myth and traditionally the crocodile was described as a relative (normally a father or grandfather).&lt;ref name="Guggisberg"/&gt;

===Examples of large unconfirmed saltwater crocodiles===
Large saltwater crocodiles have always attracted mainstream attention throughout the ages, and have suffered from all sorts of big fish stories and hunter tales, due to man's desire to find the largest of any given thing. Therefore, the largest size recorded for a saltwater crocodile has always been a subject of considerable controversy. The reason behind unverified sizes is either the case of insufficient/inconclusive data or exaggeration from a folkloric point of view. This section is dedicated to examples of the largest saltwater crocodiles recorded outside scientific norms measurement and estimation, with the aim of satisfying the public interest without creating data pollution, as well as serving an educational purpose of guiding the reader to separate fact from possible fiction. Below, in descending order starting from the largest, are some examples of large unconfirmed saltwater crocodiles, recorded throughout history.

* A crocodile shot in the [[Bay of Bengal]] in 1840 was reported at {{convert|10.1|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}}. Furthermore, this specimen was claimed to have a belly girth of {{convert|4.17|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}} and a body mass estimated {{convert|3000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. However, the skull of this specimen was examined by Guinness Records and found to be only {{convert|66.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, indicating the above size was considerably exaggerated and the animal would have probably measured no more than {{convert|5.89|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;

Due to the difficulty of trapping and measuring a very large living crocodile, the accuracy of these dimensions is yet to be verified. These observations and estimations have been made by park officials over the course of ten years, from 2006 to 2016, however, regardless of the skill of the observers it cannot be compared to a verified tape measurement, especially considering the uncertainty inherent in visual size estimation in the wild.&lt;ref name=Bayliss&gt;Bayliss, P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8525">'''Seven stages of action''' is a term coined by the [[usability]] consultant [[Donald Norman]]. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Action Cycle.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Action Cycle as described by [[Donald Norman]]. {{deletable image-caption}}]]  --&gt;He explains this phrase in chapter two of his book ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]]'', in the context of explaining the psychology of a person behind the task performed by him or her.

== Building up the Stages ==
=== History ===
The history behind the action cycle starts from a conference in [[Italy]] attended by Donald Norman.
This excerpt has been taken from the book ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am in Italy at a conference. I watch the next speaker attempt to thread a film onto a projector that he never used before. He puts the reel into place, then takes it off and reverses it. Another person comes to help. Jointly they thread the film through the projector and hold the free end, discussing how to put it on the takeup reel. Two more people come over to help and then another. The voices grow louder, in three languages: Italian, German and English. One person investigates the controls, manipulating each and announcing the result. Confusion mounts. I can no longer observe all that is happening. The conference organizer comes over. After a few moments he turns and faces the audience, who had been waiting patiently in the auditorium. "Ahem," he says, "is anybody expert in projectors?" Finally, fourteen minutes after the speaker had started to thread the film (and eight minutes after the scheduled start of the session) a blue-coated technician appears. He scowls, then promptly takes the entire film off the projector, rethreads it, and gets it working.&lt;ref name="ch2"&gt;[[Donald Norman|Norman, Donald A.]], "Psychology of Everyday Action". ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]]''. New York: Basic Book, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45–46}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Norman pondered on the reasons that made something like threading of a projector difficult to do. To examine this, he wanted to know what happened when something implied nothing. In order to do that, he examined the structure of an action. So to get something done, a notion of what is wanted – the goal that is to be achieved, needs to be started. Then, something is done to the world i.e. take action to move oneself or manipulate someone or something. Finally, the checking is required if the goal was made. This led to formulation of Stages of Execution and Evaluation.&lt;ref name="ch2" /&gt;{{rp|46}}

=== Stages of Execution ===
''Execution'' formally means to perform or do something. Norman explains that a person sitting on an armchair while reading a book at dusk, might need more light when it becomes dimmer and dimmer. To do that, he needs to switch on the button of a lamp i.e. get more light (the [[goal]]). To do this, one must need to specify on how to move one's body, how to stretch to reach the light switch and how to extend one's finger to push the button. The goal has to be translated into an intention, which in turn has to be made into an action sequence.

Thus, formulation of stages of execution:
* Start at the top with the ''goal'', the state that is to be achieved.
* The goal is translated into an ''[[intention]]'' to do some action.
* The intention must be translated into a set of internal commands, an ''action sequence'' that can be performed to satisfy the intention.
* The action sequence is still a mutual event: nothing happens until it is ''executed'', performed upon the world.

=== Stages of Evaluation ===
''[[Evaluation]]'' formally means to examine and calculate. Norman explains that after turning on the light, we evaluate if it is actually turned on. A careful judgement is then passed on how the light has affected our world i.e. the room in which the person is sitting on the armchair while reading a book.

The formulation of the stages of evaluation can be described as:
* Evaluation starts with our ''[[perception]]'' of the world.
* This perception must then be ''interpreted'' according to our expectations.
* Then it is compared ''(evaluated)'' with respect to both our intentions and our goals.

=== Seven Stages of Action ===

'''Seven Stages of Action''' constitute four stages of execution, three stages of evaluation and our goals.

1. Forming the goal

2. Forming the intention

3. Specifying an action

4. Executing the action

5. Perceiving the state of the world

6. Interpreting the state of the world

7. Evaluating the outcome [http://cmapspublic.ihmc.us/servlet/SBReadResourceServlet?rid=1165167923187_663887047_11513&amp;partName=htmltext]

== The Gulfs  ==
=== The Gulf of Execution ===
The difference between the intentions and the allowable actions is the ''[[Gulf of execution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, Ted. "Lecture on Cognition and Perception". ''User Interface Design''. Simon Fraser University. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Consider the movie projector example: one problem resulted from the Gulf of Execution. The person wanted to set up the projector. Ideally, this would be a simple thing to do. But no, a long, complex sequence was required. It wasn't all clear what actions had to be done to accomplish the intentions of setting up the projector and showing the film."&lt;ref name="ch2" /&gt;{{rp|51}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Gulf of Evaluation ===
The ''[[Gulf of evaluation]]'' reflects the amount of effort that the person must exert to interpret the physical state of the system and to determine how well the expectations and intentions have been met.&lt;ref&gt;Hearst, Marti. "Lecture on Gulf of Evaluation". ''User Interface Design and Development''. University of California at Berkeley. 1999. &lt;http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/courses/is213/s99/Lectures/Lecture10/sld010.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In the movie projector example there was also a problem with the Gulf of Evaluation. Even when the film was in the projector, it was difficult to tell if it had been threaded correctly."&lt;ref name="ch2" /&gt;{{rp|51–52}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Usage as Design Aids ==
The seven-stage structure is referenced as design aid to act as a basic checklist for designers' &lt;ref&gt;Gore, Elizabeth. "III: Donald Norman: Seven Stages of Action. ''Web Site Analysis'', University of Illinois at Chicago. 2004. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://bethgore.com/Beth%20Gore%20Home%20Page/documents/Web%20Site%20Analysis%20-%20UIC.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707230442/http://bethgore.com/Beth%20Gore%20Home%20Page/documents/Web%20Site%20Analysis%20-%20UIC.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; questions to ensure that the Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation are bridged.&lt;ref name="ch2" /&gt;{{rp|52–53}}

The Seven Stages of Action can be broken down into 4 main principles of good design:
* ''[[Visibility]]'' - By looking, the user can tell the state of the device and the alternatives for action.
* ''A Good Conceptual Model'' - The designer provides a good conceptual model for the user, with consistency in the presentation of operations and results and a coherent, consistent system image.
* ''Good mappings'' - It is possible to determine the relationships between actions and results, between the controls and their effects, and between the system state and what is visible.
* ''[[Feedback]]'' - The user receives full and continuous feedback about the results of the actions.

The '''SiLA consortium''' is a [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] membership organization formed by software suppliers, system integrators and pharma/biotech companies. This consortium for '''Standardization in Lab Automation''' (SiLA), develops and introduces new device and data interface standards allowing rapid integration of lab [[Automation]] hardware and data management systems. Highly skilled experts of member companies contribute in SiLA′s technical work groups. Membership is open for institutions, corporations and individuals active in the life science lab automation industry. The SiLA consortium provides professional training, support and certification services to suppliers and system integrators implementing SiLA compliant interfaces.

==Mission==
SiLA is the global initiative to standardize software interfaces in the field of life science research instrumentation and [[Laboratory automation]]. Instigated by the pharmaceutical industry's need for flexible laboratory automation, the initiative is supported by major device and software suppliers worldwide.

==Background==
Understanding the mechanisms of life requires extensive, often repetitive, experimentation. Laboratory automation, therefore, has become instrumental to the progress of the life sciences.
Industry provides commercial laboratory devices to perform increasingly sophisticated tasks. However, combining equipment from different providers to work in concert often proves impossible. Exporting captured data from proprietary software for further analysis can be frustrating or impossible.
This situation leads to a waste of resources: Available equipment needs to be replaced for compatibility reasons, software drivers have to be purchased or developed, and data conversion is time consuming.
Such technical obstacles impede the development of higher level autonomous experimentation systems.
SiLA enables researchers to focus on their scientific questions by reducing equipment connectivity effort to a minimum. This is achieved by using proven, tested and maintained documentation and code.

==History==
Advancements seen on the home consumer electronics marked like [[USB]] or [[UPnP]] triggered the idea of applying a similar approach to the laboratory automation environment. Why was it possible to easily upload pictures from any digital camera on any computer but in the same time not even thinkable to replace a lab device (e.g.: a [[Shaker (laboratory)|Shaker]]) of one brand with a Shaker of a different brand? Analyzing the situation led to the conclusion that the incompatibility was a result of missing interface definitions. The idea of a standardized interface based on the Common Command Set (CCS) concept was born.
However, SiLA 1.x  has some limitations: It is based on XML/Soap which is considered as outdated. Getting started with SiLA 1.x is not an easy process. This lead to the proposition of a spin-off group of the SiLA consortium to develop a new standard: SiLA 2. Learning from SiLA 1.x and taking many concepts from it, SiLA 2 had the vision of being as accessible as possible. A major goal is to create a community working on the development of new Features.

==Membership==
SiLA has formed a not-for-profit membership organisation. SiLA requires members to pay annual membership dues. Details on membership classes and related fees can be found [https://sila-standard.com/join-us/ here].

==Organisation Structure==
[[File:SiLA.Board of Directors.full.png|thumb|SiLA board of directors]]
SiLA is a not-for-profit membership corporation with global footprint. Membership is open for institutions, corporations and individuals active in the life science lab automation industry.
The SiLA consortium provides professional training, support and certification services to suppliers and system integrators implementing SiLA compliant interfaces.

==Scope of Standardization==
[[File:SiLA.Scope of Standardization.full.png|thumb|SiLA 1.x - Main scope]]
The SiLA foundation of standards addresses control and data interfaces between devices and process management, LIMS and Enterprise Systems.

==SiLA Standards==
SiLA has developed and released several standards.

===SiLA 2===
SiLA considers every entity in the modern laboratory as a service. Focusing on behaviour and service oriented design structures lead to the Feature Definition Language (FDL). The concept of a Feature (service that the SiLA Server offers) serves as a common communication base for subject matter experts (SME), IT experts and end users. SiLA is built to connect systems in a laboratory, such as [[Laboratory information management system]]s, [[electronic lab notebook]]s, [[chromatography software]] and laboratory devices such as balances, pipettors and various other analytical instruments.
Based on [[HTTP/2]], SiLA uses [[Protocol Buffers]] to serialize payload data. Furthermore, SiLA 2 uses the wire format provided by [[gRPC]]. 
SiLA 2 is based on a microservice architecture. Its basic structure is highly comparable to that of a web server (≙SiLA Server) and web client (≙SiLA Client).

===SiLA 1.x - Device Interface Standard===
[[File:SiLA.Integration level.full.png|thumb|SiLA 1.x - Three supported integration levels]]
The SiLA device interface standard covers all ISO/OSI levels of the device control interface from physical to application layer.
The interface standard is based on web service/SOAP communication with the devices. Commands are generally executed in asynchronous manner with an immediate response and a delayed event after completion of the command processing or after an error. Error recovery procedures are also supported and the general behavior of the devices is managed by a state machine. The state machine enables also complex behaviors like parallel processing of commands and command queuing.
By supporting three different integration levels, SiLA provides a unique, standardized interface between lab automation devices and process management systems so that also legacy devices can be integrated in SiLA compliant systems. SiLA compliance can be achieved by providing native, directly embedded SiLA device interfaces or by software only SiLA drivers and/or interface converters. The SiLA Device Control and Data Interface Standard eases and accelerates the integration and adaptation of systems through generic Device Class Interfaces providing Common Command Sets.

===SiLA 1.x - Common Command Dictionary===
By grouping devices of the same functionality device classes can be created. SiLA Common Command Sets define commands for these device classes. SiLA defines the command names, the number of parameters and their names as well as the return data. Since commands and parameters are described in the WSDL documentation tag of the commands web service, a process management software (PMS) can automatically generate a list available commands for each device.
SiLA has defined about 30 device classes and a command library with about 100 commands. Commands range from mandatory commands that are needed to make transitions in the state machine, over required commands for the specific device class, to optional commands for which not every device in the device class might provide the functionality. In addition guidelines for the implementation of supplier-specific device commands and parameters are provided.
Some commands are applicable for almost every device class. For example, the commands SetParameter, GetParameter, ExecuteMethod are widely used. Also PrepareForOutput and PrepareForInput are common because they enable the transport mechanisms to transfer labware items from device to device. The mandatory commands include operations like Reset, Initialize, Abort and Pause. In addition also locking a device for exclusive use is provided.

[[File:Tong2ji1.jpg|thumb|[[Chinese characters]] for ''tongji'']]
'''Tongji''' ({{zh|c=童乩|p=''tóngjī''|w=''t'ung-chi''|l=youth diviner}}; [[Taiwanese Romanization System|Tâi-lô]]: tâng-ki) or '''Jitong''' ({{zh|c=乩童|p=''jītóng''|w=''chi-t'ung''|l=divining youth}}) is a [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese folk]] religious specialist, usually translated as a "[[spirit medium]]", "[[oracle]]", or "[[shaman]]".

This word compounds ''tong'' [[Wikt:童|童]] "child; youth; boy servant" and ''ji'' [[Wikt:乩|乩]] "to divine" (cf. ''[[Fuji (planchette writing)|fuji]]'' 扶乩 "divination; planchette writing"). Regional variants include [[Hokkien]] ''tâng-ki'' 童乩 and [[Canton dialect|Cantonese]] ''gei-tung'' 乩童 or ''san-daa'' 神打.  

A ''tongji'' or ''jitong'' is a person believed to have been chosen by a particular ''[[shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' 神 "god; spirit" as the earthly vehicle for divine expression. The Chinese differentiate a ''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]''  巫 "shaman; healer; spirit medium" who gains control of forces in the spirit world versus a ''tongji'' who appears to be entirely under the control of forces in the spirit world.

Frequently a person who will become a ''tongji'' to experiences a feeling of compulsion of something that will possess them. The person may attempt to resist that compulsion, but should their resistance fail, they will enter into a [[altered state of consciousness|trance]] in which they  may beat themselves with a nail-studded ball at the end of a cord and handle to the point that he draws blood from multiple wounds on his back. While in this trance state the ''tongji'' is believed to be possessed by a ''shen''.

'''Umoove''' is a [[high tech]] [[startup company]] that has developed and patented a software-only face and [[eye tracking]] technology. The idea was first conceived as an attempt to aid people with disabilities but has since evolved. The only compatibility qualification for [[tablet computers]] and [[smartphones]] to run Umoove software is a front-facing camera. 
Umoove headquarters are in [[Israel]] on [[Jerusalem]]’s [[Har Hotzvim]].

Umoove has 15 employees and received two million dollars in financing in 2012. The company’s original founders invested around $800,000 to start the business in 2010.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|title=NewYorkTimes|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/eye-tracking-tech-will-be-open-to-iphones-others/?_r=0|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013 Umoove was named one of the top three most promising Israeli start ups by Newsgeeks magazine.&lt;ref name="21c"&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel21C|url=http://israel21c.org/technology/Umoove-operates-your-mobile-through-head-movements-alone/|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company also participated in the 2013 [[LeWeb]] conference in [[Paris]], [[France]], where innovative technology startups are showcased.&lt;ref name="YKL"&gt;{{cite web|title=LeWebsite|url=http://paris.leweb.co/participants/speakers/yitzi-kempinski/umoove|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

==Technology==
The technology uses information extracted from previous frames, such as the angle of the user’s head to predict where to look for facial targets in the next frame. This anticipation minimizes the amount of computation needed to scan each image.&lt;ref name="spc"&gt;{{cite web|title=SpectrumWebsite|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/eyetracking-software-goes-mobile|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Umoove accounts for variances in environment, lighting conditions and user hand shake/movement. The technology is designed to provide a consistent experience, whether you’re in a brightly lit area or a darkened basement, and to work fluidly between them by adapting its processing when it detects color and brightness shifts. It uses an active stabilization technique to filter out natural body movements from an unstable camera in order to minimize false-positive motion detection.&lt;ref name="tch"&gt;{{cite web|title=TechCrunch|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/13/Umoove-is-poised-to-blanket-the-world-with-mobile-head-tracking-tech-with-or-without-the-galaxy-s-iv/|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Running the Umoove software on a [[Samsung Galaxy S3]] is said to take up only 2% [[CPU]].&lt;ref name="spc"/&gt;
Umoove works exclusively with software and there is no hardware add-on necessary. It can be run on any [[smartphone]] or [[tablet computer]] that has a front-facing camera. Umoove claims that even a low-quality camera on an old device will run their software flawlessly.

==Umoove Experience==
In January 2014 Umoove released its first game onto the app store.&lt;ref name="ITN"&gt;{{cite web|title=iTunes|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/umoove-experience-3d-face/id731389410?mt=8//|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Umoove Experience game lets users control where they are 'flying' in the game through simple gestures and motions with their head. The [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] will basically go toward wherever the user looks.&lt;ref name="BGR"&gt;{{cite web|title=BGRwebsite|url=http://bgr.com/2014/01/14/best-iphone-game-favorites-umoove//|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was created to showcase the technology for game developers&lt;ref name="TUA"&gt;{{cite web|title=TUAWWEBSITE|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2014/01/15/fly-through-umoove-experience-an-addictive-ios-game-that-uses-f//|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that did not stop some from criticizing its simplicity.&lt;ref name="CNT"&gt;{{cite web|title=CNETWEBSITE|url=http://www.cnet.com.au/iphone-game-tracks-face-movement-for-in-game-navigation-339346418.htm//|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Umoove also announced that they raised another one million dollars and that they are opening offices in [[Silicon Valley]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="GEK"/&gt;

In February 2014, Umoove announced that their face-tracking [[software development kit]] is available for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] developers as well as [[iOS]].&lt;ref name="NCH"&gt;{{cite web|title=TechCrunchFeb14|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/umoove-android-adk-beta/|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
The Umoove Experience garnered mostly positive reviews&lt;ref name="GIG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gigaom|url=http://gigaom.com/2014/01/14/this-awesome-ios-game-tracks-your-head-movement-to-control-the-direction-you-fly//|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; from bloggers and mainstream media with some predicting that it could be the future of [[mobile gaming]].&lt;ref name="BGR"/&gt; [[Mashable]] wrote that Umoove’s technology could be the emergence of [[gesture recognition]] technology in the mobile space, similar to [[Kinect]] with console gaming and what [[Leap Motion]] has done with desktop computers.&lt;ref name="MSH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mashable|url=http://mashable.com/2014/01/15/this-app-lets-you-control-a-game-using-face-tracking//|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, however, remain skeptical. [[CNET]], for example, did not give the game a positive review and called the [[eye tracking]] technology ‘freaky but cool’. They also noted that pioneering technologies have been known to fall short of expectations, citing [[Apple Inc]]’s [[Siri]] as an example. The technology blog [[GigaOM]] said that the Umoove Experience is ’awesome’&lt;ref name="GIG"/&gt; and [[technology evangelist]] [[Robert Scoble]] has called Umoove "brilliant".&lt;ref name="RSV"&gt;{{cite web|title=ScoblePlus|url=https://plus.google.com/+Scobleizer/posts/SKQEzTymKrk|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==uHealth==
In January 2015, Umoove released uHealth, an [[mobile application]] that uses [[eye tracking]] game-like exercise to challenge the user’s ability to be attentive, continuously focus, follow commands and avoid distractions. The app is designed in the form of two games, one to improve attention and another that hones focus.&lt;ref name="CTV"&gt;{{cite web|title=CTV|url= http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/israeli-start-up-creates-app-to-help-concentration-1.2225346|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
uHealth is a training tool, not a [[diagnostic]]. Umoove has stated that they want to use their technology for diagnosing [[neurological disorders]] but this will depend on clinical tests and [[FDA]] approval.&lt;ref name="T2I"&gt;{{cite web|title=TimesofIsraelShamah|url= http://www.timesofisrael.com/eye-tracking-tech-focuses-on-the-challenge-of-focus/|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company cites the direct relationship between [[eye movements]] and [[brain activity]] as well as various vision based therapies have been backed by many scientific studies conducted over the past decades. uHealth is the first time this type of therapy is delivered right to the end user through a simple download.&lt;ref name="RNN"&gt;{{cite web|title=RapidNewsNetwork|url= http://rapidnewsnetwork.com/umoove-launches-eye-tracking-based-ios-app-improving-attention-focus/7955/|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaboration rumors==
In March 2013 there were rumors on the internet that Umoove would be the functioning software embedded into the [[Samsung Galaxy S4]], which was due to launch that month. This rumor was perpetrated by, among others, [[New York Times]],&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; [[Techcrunch]]&lt;ref name="tch"/&gt; and [[Yahoo]].&lt;ref name="YHO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo|url=https://news.yahoo.com/galaxy-iv-eye-tracking-tech-coming-iphone-other-152506303.html;_ylt=A2KJ2PbcKUhRHUgAOhvQtDMD|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Once Samsung launched without the Umoove technology rumors about a potential collaboration with [[Apple Inc]] hit the web. It has been said that due to the fact that [[Apple Inc]] is losing market share and stock value to Samsung they will be more aggressive and [[eye tracking]] is a logical place to make that move.&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;{{cite web|title=TimesofIsrael|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/does-the-new-iphone-feature-israeli-start-ups-eye-tracking-tech/|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
