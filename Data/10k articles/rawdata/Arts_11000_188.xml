"'''Adoro te devote'''" is a [[Eucharistic]] [[hymn]] written by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/11358879/Not-a-hymn-but-a-personal-poem.html Christopher Howse, 'Not a hymn but a personal poem,']. ''The Telegraph''. 17 Jan 2015. retrieved 5 Nov 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; "Adoro te devote" is one of the five Eucharistic hymns, which were composed and set to music for the Solemnity of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]], instituted in 1264 by [[Pope Urban IV]] as a [[Solemnity]] for the entire [[Roman Catholic Church]].

Since the beginning of its composition and it being set to music, the "Adoro te devote" was chanted as an Eucharistic Hymn during the Saint Mass ''in honorem SS. Sacramenti'' (in honour of the Most [[Blessed Sacrament]]), as it was written in the Latin manuscripts. So it was also chanted for the [[Eucharistic adoration]].

Strictly speaking, Aquinas seems to have used it also as a private prayer, for a daily adoration of the Blessed Sacrament.

The "Adoro te devote" is one of the medieval poetic compositions, being used as spoken prayers and also as chanted hymns, which were preserved in the [[Tridentine Mass|''Missale Romanum'']] published in 1570 following the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563).

The "Adoro te devote" is still sung today, though its use is optional in the post-[[Vatican II]] [[Mass of Paul VI|Ordinary form]].

There are two&lt;ref name= "Zenith.org_May 23, 2010" /&gt; variant readings of the Latin text, with slightly different nuances to some of the words: 
''"most of the variations occur in the first two verses. The substitution of the words ''"posset omni scélere"'' in place of ''"quit ab omni scélere"'' in the second-to-last verse and ''"cupio"'' for ''"sitio"'' in the closing one are practically the only other changes"''&lt;ref name= "Zenith.org_May 23, 2010" /&gt;. 
This does not affect the overall meaning of the lines or stanzas so that ''"either variant may be legitimately used according to local custom."''&lt;ref name= "Zenith.org_May 23, 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/the-adoro-te-devote |author1= E.

: Prostrate I adore Thee, Deity unseen,
: Who Thy glory hidest 'neath these shadows mean;
: Lo, to Thee surrendered, my whole heart is bowed,
: Tranced as it beholds Thee, shrined within the cloud.

: Taste, and touch, and vision, to discern Thee fail;
: Faith, that comes by hearing, pierces through the veil.
: I believe whate'er the Son of God hath told;
: What the Truth hath spoken, that for truth I hold.

: On the Cross lay hidden but thy Deity,
: Here is hidden also Thy Humanity:
: But in both believing and confessing, Lord,
: Ask I what the dying thief of Thee implored.

: Thy dread wounds, like Thomas, though I cannot see,
: His be my confession, Lord and God, of Thee,
: Make my faith unfeigned ever-more increase,
: Give me hope unfading, love that cannot cease.

: O memorial wondrous of the Lord's own death;
: Living Bread, that giveth all Thy creatures breath,
: Grant my spirit ever by Thy life may live,
: To my taste Thy sweetness never-failing give.

: [[Pelican#Religion, mythology, and popular culture|Pelican]] of mercy, Jesus, Lord and God,
: Cleanse me, wretched sinner, in Thy Precious Blood:
: Blood where one drop for human-kind outpoured
: Might from all transgression have the world restored.

: Jesus, whom now veiled, I by faith descry,
: What my soul doth thirst for, do not, Lord, deny,
: That thy face unveiled, I at last may see,
: With the blissful vision blest, my God, of Thee. Amen.
|
:O Godhead hid, devoutly I adore Thee,
:Who truly art within the forms before me; 
:To Thee my heart I bow with bended knee, 
:As failing quite in contemplating Thee.

:Sight, touch, and taste in Thee are each deceived; 
:The ear alone most safely is believed: 
:I believe all the Son of God has spoken,
:Than Truth's own word there is no truer token.

:God only on the Cross lay hid from view; 
:But here lies hid at once the Manhood too:
:And I, in both professing my belief,
:Make the same prayer as the repentant thief.

:Thy wounds, as Thomas saw, I do not see; 
:Yet Thee confess my Lord and God to be: 
:Make me believe Thee ever more and more; 
:In Thee my hope, in Thee my love to store.

:O thou Memorial of our Lord's own dying! 
:O Bread that living art and vivifying! 
:Make ever Thou my soul on Thee to live; 
:Ever a taste of Heavenly sweetness give.

:O loving Pelican! O Jesu, Lord! 
:Unclean I am, but cleanse me in Thy Blood;
:Of which a single drop, for sinners spilt,
:Is ransom for a world's entire guilt.

:Jesu! Whom for the present veil'd I see, 
:What I so thirst for, O vouchsafe to me: 
:That I may see Thy countenance unfolding, 
:And may be blest Thy glory in beholding. Amen. 
|
:Godhead here in hiding, whom I do adore,
:Masked by these bare shadows, shape and nothing more,
:See, Lord, at thy service low lies here a heart
:Lost, all lost in wonder at the God thou art.

:Seeing, touching, tasting are in thee deceived:
:How says trusty hearing? that shall be believed;
:What God’s Son has told me, take for truth I do;
:Truth himself speaks truly or there’s nothing true.

:On the cross thy godhead made no sign to men,
:Here thy very manhood steals from human ken:
:Both are my confession, both are my belief,
:And I pray the prayer of the dying thief.

:I am not like Thomas, wounds I cannot see,
:But can plainly call thee Lord and God as he;
:Let me to a deeper faith daily nearer move,
:Daily make me harder hope and dearer love.

:O thou our reminder of Christ crucified,
:Living Bread, the life of us for whom he died,
:Lend this life to me then: feed and feast my mind,
:There be thou the sweetness man was meant to find.

:Bring the tender tale true of the Pelican;
:Bathe me, Jesu Lord, in what thy bosom ran—
:Blood whereof a single drop has power to win
:All the world forgiveness of its world of sin.

:Jesu, whom I look at shrouded here below,
:I beseech thee send me what I thirst for so,
:Some day to gaze on thee face to face in light
:And be blest for ever with thy glory’s sight. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://incaelo.wordpress.com/2010/05/26/adoro-te-devote-two-versions-and-a-translation/ Adoro te devote, two versions and a translation] retrieved 5 Nov 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional translations, with their opening line, are as follows: 
:[[John O'Hagan]] (1822-1890) [http://www.preces-latinae.org/thesaurus/Hymni/AdoroTe.html Hidden God, devoutly I adore thee]

== Liturgical use ==
This hymn was added to the [[Roman Missal]] in 1570 by [[Pope Pius V]], and also it has more quotations in the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (n. 1381).

This Eucharistic hymn was generally chanted with a [[genuflection]] in front of the Blessed Sacrament, which is Jesus Christ God, the Lord and the Saviour, the [[Saint]] King, [[King of Israel]] and [[King of Kings]]. 

It was much more like than what is written in the Bible for the [[Sanctus]], something generally chanted in [[Heaven]] by the [[hierarchy of angels|angelic hierarchies]].

The hymn is typically used as an Eucharistic hymn and is sung either during the distribution of communion at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], or during the [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]].

== Final prayer ==
Until the first half of the nineteenth century, the (Eucharistic) chant ''Adoro Te devote'' was often used to be followed by this second [[Thanksgiving]] prayer, referred to Jesus Christ God:

:''Obsecro Te, sancte Domine Jesu''
:''Christe, ut passio tua sit mihi virtus''
:''qua muniar atque defendar,''
:''vulnera tua sit mihi cibus potusque''
:''quibus pascar, inebrier atque delecter;''
:''aspersio sanguinis tui sit mihi ablutio''
:''omnium delictorum meorum;''
:''resurrectio tua sit mihi gloria''
:''sempiterna. In his sit mihi refectio,''
:''exultatio sanitas et dulcedo''
:''cordis mei. Qui vivis et regnas in''
:''unitate Patri et Spiritus Sancti Deus''
:''per omnia saecula saeculorum''.
:''Amen.''

The 13 December 1849, Pope [[Pio IX]] stated a period of some days of [[indulgence]] in favour of any Christian people having declaimed this prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Riva, ''Manuale di Filotea'', Milano, 1860, pag. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Aladdin''''' is an upcoming American [[Musical film|musical]] [[romantic fantasy]] [[adventure film]] directed by [[Guy Ritchie]], from the screenplay co-written with [[John August]] and [[Vanessa Taylor]], and produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is a live-action adaptation of Disney's [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|1992 animated film of the same name]], which is in turn based on the Arabic [[Fairy tale|folktale]] [[Aladdin|of the same name]] from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' and [[Les mille et une nuits|the French interpretation]] by [[Antoine Galland]]. The film stars [[Mena Massoud]] as the [[Aladdin (Disney character)|title character]] alongside [[Will Smith]], [[Naomi Scott]], [[Marwan Kenzari]], [[Navid Negahban]], [[Nasim Pedrad]], [[Billy Magnussen]], and [[Numan Acar]]. 

In October 2016, Disney announced Guy Ritchie would direct a live-action ''Aladdin'' remake.

== Production ==
=== Development and casting ===
On October 10, 2016, it was announced that [[Guy Ritchie]] would direct a [[List of Disney live-action reimaginings of animated films|live-action]] ''[[Aladdin]]'' film with [[John August]] penning the screenplay for [[Walt Disney Pictures]] with [[Dan Lin]] attached as producer. The studio said that the film would be "an ambitious and nontraditional" take on the tale of ''Aladdin'' that would keep much of the musical elements of the [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|original film]]. On the non-traditional aspect, the studio planned for the film to be told in a [[nonlinear narrative|nonlinear]] format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/10/aladdin-guy-ritchie-disney-live-action-film-sherlock-holmes-1201834102/|last=Fleming Jr.|first=Mike|title=Guy Ritchie To Direct Live Action 'Aladdin' For Disney|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=October 10, 2016|date=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=Disney's Live-Action 'Aladdin' Enlists Guy Ritchie to Direct|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disneys-live-action-aladdin-enlists-936881|accessdate=July 11, 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, Lin revealed about casting during an interview, saying that they were looking for a diverse cast and that they would not try "to make ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (film)|Prince of Persia]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|url=http://collider.com/aladdin-live-action-movie-diverse-cast/|title=Disney’s Live-Action ‘Aladdin’ Won’t Be ‘Prince of Persia’, Says Producer; Promises Diverse Cast|publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|accessdate=February 8, 2017|date=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A worldwide casting call for the lead roles of [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]] and [[Princess Jasmine]] commenced in March 2017, with principal production set to begin in the UK in July 2017 until January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galuppo|first1=Mia|title=Disney's Live-Action 'Aladdin' Holds Open Casting Call for Leads|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disneys-live-action-aladdin-holds-open-casting-call-leads-984892|accessdate=March 10, 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 9, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 19, 2017, it was reported that either [[Gabriel Iglesias]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will Smith May Play The Genie In 'Aladdin'|url=https://www.elitedaily.com/entertainment/celebrity/will-smith-genie-aladdin-twitter/1864522}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Will Smith]] was in talks for the role of [[Genie (Disney character)|Genie]], for which the latter was confirmed in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= Jr|first1=Mike Fleming|last2=Busch|first2=Anita|title=Will Smith In Talks For Genie Role In Disney’s Live-Action ‘Aladdin’|url=http://deadline.com/2017/04/will-smith-genie-role-aladdin-disney-1202072355/|accessdate=April 20, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AladdinProductionTroubles"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Rebecca|last2=Galuppo|first2=Mia|title='Aladdin': Disney Struggles to Find Stars for Its Live-Action Movie|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/aladdin-movie-disney-struggles-find-stars-1019690|accessdate=July 11, 2017|work=The Hollywood Reported|date=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithScottMassoud"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://variety.com/2017/film/news/aladdin-will-smith-naomi-scott-jasmine-cast-mena-massoud-d23-1202496767/|title= ‘Aladdin’: Disney Casts Will Smith, Mena Massoud, Naomi Scott|last=Knapp|first=JD|publisher=''Variety''|date= July 15, 2017|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, it was revealed that [[Jade Thirlwall]] was in talks for the part of Princess Jasmine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Soteriou|first1=Stephanie|title=Little Mix's Jade Thirlwall to play Princess Jasmine in Aladdin remake?|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/little-mixs-jade-thirlwall-play-princess-jasmine-aladdin-remake-105402683.html|accessdate=May 22, 2017|work=Yahoo UK|date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2017, it was revealed that principal production on ''Aladdin'' had been pushed back by a month, to August 2017, due to struggles in finding the right actor to portray the titular role. It was revealed that over 2,000 actors and actresses had auditioned for the roles of Aladdin and Jasmine but that finding a male lead of Middle-Eastern or Indian descent in his 20s who could act and sing had proven difficult. [[Naomi Scott]] and [[Tara Sutaria]] were revealed to be the final two actresses in the running for the role of Jasmine, but neither could be cast until a chemistry test was done with whomever was cast as Aladdin. The studio was interested in casting [[Dev Patel]] or [[Riz Ahmed]] for the lead role of Aladdin, but neither were considered likely to obtain the role. In what became the final rounds of screen testing, actors Achraf Koutet, [[Mena Massoud]], and George Kosturos were still in the running for the role of Aladdin. However, the studio had begun perusing old audition tapes for the role, having not been satisfied by the latest round of screen tests.&lt;ref name="AladdinProductionTroubles" /&gt;

At the 2017 [[D23 (Disney)|D23 Expo]], on July 15,  it was announced that Massoud had been cast as Aladdin and Scott had been cast as Jasmine, ending a four month long open casting call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Galuppo|first=Mia|title='Aladdin': Disney Remake Finds Its Leads|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/aladdin-disney-remake-finds-leads-1020047|accessdate=July 15, 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithScottMassoud" /&gt; On July 17, 2017, it was revealed that Disney had hired [[Vanessa Taylor]] to polish the original screenplay by August, specifically to do some "character work" and what is called "[[script doctor]]ing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Mike|url=http://screenrant.com/disney-live-action-aladdin-rewrite-game-of-thrones/|title=Disney’s Live-Action Aladdin is Getting a Rewrite|website=ScreenRant|accessdate=September 6, 2017|date=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Richie and the studio focused on casting the other main roles with filming slated to start in August in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sneider|first1=Jeff|title="Game of Thrones" Scribe Vanessa Taylor to Rewrite Guy Ritchie’s "Aladdin" for Disney (Exclusive)|url=http://www.tracking-board.com/game-of-thrones-scribe-vanessa-taylor-to-rewrite-guy-ritchies-aladdin-for-disney-exclusive/|accessdate=September 6, 2017|work=The Tracking Board|date=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, [[Marwan Kenzari]] joined the cast as [[Jafar (Disney)|Jafar]] with [[Nasim Pedrad]] cast in a newly created role as "a hand maid and friend of Jasmine" who will serve as a "comic relief" and [[Numan Acar]] as [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Hakim|Hakim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kroll|first=Justin|title=Disney’s Live-Action ‘Aladdin’ Reboot Casts ‘Mummy’ Actor as Jafar|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/aladdin-reboot-jafar-marwan-kenzari-1202516082/|accessdate=August 4, 2017|work=Variety|date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AcarCast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=N'Duka|first1=Amanda|title=Numan Acar Cast In Disney’s ‘Aladdin’ Remake|url=http://deadline.com/2017/08/numan-acar-disney-aladdin-remake-1202152768/|accessdate=August 21, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, [[Billy Magnussen]] joined the cast in a newly created role as Prince Anders alongside [[Navid Negahban]] as the Sultan.&lt;ref name="MagnussenCast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galuppo|first1=Mia|title=Disney's Live-Action 'Aladdin' Casts Billy Magnussen as New Character (Exclusive)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disneys-live-action-aladdin-casts-billy-magnussen-as-new-character-1035329|accessdate=September 6, 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 5, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NegahbanCast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=N'Duka|first1=Amanda|title=Navid Negahban Cast As The Sultan In Disney’s ‘Aladdin’ Remake|url=http://deadline.com/2017/09/navid-negahban-disney-aladdin-remake-1202162634/|accessdate=September 6, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, it was reported that the white extras were being applied brown make-up during filming in order to "blend in", which caused an outcry among fans and critics, branding the practice as "an insult to the whole industry" while accusing the producers of not recruiting people with Middle-Eastern or North African heritage. Disney responded to the controversy, saying, "Diversity of our cast and background performers was a requirement and only in a handful of instances when it was a matter of specialty skills, safety and control (special effects rigs, stunt performers and handling of animals) were crew made up to blend in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/42601893/aladdin-disney-defends-making-up-white-actors-to-blend-in-during-crowd-scenes|title= Aladdin: Disney defends 'making up' white actors to 'blend in' during crowd scenes|date=January 7, 2017|website=BBC News|accessdate=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disney accused of 'browning up' white actors for various Asian roles in Aladdin|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/disney-aladdin-brown-up-cast-will-smith-extra-long-a8146361.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=January 14, 2018|date=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anders' films have been shown at the [[Cannes International Film Festival]] and at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=UCSB-ProfessorProfile&gt;{{cite web|title=Allison Anders, Professor of Film &amp; Media Studies|url=http://www.filmandmedia.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/anders/anders.html|website=[[University of California Santa Barbara]]|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been awarded a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Genius Grant]] as well as a [[Peabody Award]].

==Early life==
Anders was born in [[Ashland, Kentucky|Ashland]], [[Kentucky]] to mother Alberta "Rachel" Anders (née Steed) and father Robert "Bob" Anders.&lt;ref name=FamilySearch-KYVitalRecordsIndex-1954&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary A Anders - Kentucky, Vital Record Indexes|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QKHV-VF2V|website=[[FamilySearch]]|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BlitterBaroque-Dad-2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allison|first1=Anders|title=Real Gone Daddy|url=http://msallisonanders.tumblr.com/post/122117500428/real-gone-daddy|website=Blitter Baroque: workbook y public diary de Allison Anders|accessdate=7 September 2015|date=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has four sisters, one of whom, Luanna Anders,&lt;ref name=FamilySearch-KYVitalRecordsIndex-1957&gt;{{cite web|title=Luanna Anders - Kentucky, Vital Record Indexes|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QKHF-VHPN|website=[[FamilySearch]]|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; starred in her first film, ''[[Border Radio]].'' One of her sisters is Dominique Steed née Du Bois, the daughter of Louis Ernesto Gomez-Moncalleno Du Bois.

Her paternal side has ancestry that traces back to the [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[Hatfield–McCoy feud|Hatfield]] family and, more distantly, to [[George Washington]]'s spy, [[Caleb Brewster]], while her maternal side includes another Washington spy, [[Abraham Woodhull]].&lt;ref name=BlitterBaroque-Dad-2015 /&gt;

When Anders was 4 years old, her father abandoned the family. Anders' mother and father were divorced when she was 5.&lt;ref name=People-ThingsBehindSun-2001&gt;{{cite news|last1=Espinoza|first1=Galina|last2=Wang|first2=Cynthia|title=Nightmare Revisited: Filming in the House Where She Was Raped Helped Allison Anders Heal|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20135183,00.html|accessdate=7 September 2015|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|issue=Vol. 56, No. 9|date=27 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her mother moved her and her sisters to Los Angeles, Anders suffered a mental breakdown at the age of 15 and was hospitalized. When she came out of the psychiatric ward, she was placed into foster care but ran away. She hitchhiked across the country, at one point ending up in jail. After turning 17, Anders dropped out of her Los Angeles high school and moved back to Kentucky. She later moved to London with the man who fathered her first child.&lt;ref name=PBS-Frontline-MonsterAteHollywood-2001&gt;{{cite web|title=The Monster That Ate Hollywood (Program #2007)|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/hollywood/etc/script.html|website=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=7 September 2015|date=22 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her early 20s, Anders moved back to [[Los Angeles]] with her daughter and attended junior college, [[Los Angeles Valley College]],&lt;ref name=PhillyInquirer-GasFood-1992&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=Judy|title=Tough Road To Acclaim Allison Anders, Raped At 12, Catatonic For A Year, Has Seen Her Fortunes Change.

Due to constant relocation as a child, Anders had not had a steady education. She said that growing up, most of her time was spent watching TV and going to movie theaters. Inspired by the films of [[Wim Wenders]] and other filmmakers, Anders applied to [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television|UCLA Film School]].&lt;ref name=CreativeScreenwriting-Interview-1996&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mercurio|first1=James P.|title=Contemporary Melodrama: Interview with Allison Anders|url=http://www.jamespmercurio.com/interview_anders.html|accessdate=7 September 2015|work=Creative Screenwriting|issue=Vol. 3, No. 4|date=1996|pages=25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time at UCLA, Anders produced her first sound film. Wenders attended the screening.&lt;ref name=PBS-Frontline-MonsterAteHollywood-2001 /&gt; In 1986, Anders got her B.A. in Motion Picture-Television from 
[[University of California Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=UCSB-ProfessorProfile /&gt;

==Career==

===Film===
In 1986, Anders won a [[Samuel Goldwyn Writing Awards|Samuel Goldwyn Writing Award]] for a script called ''Lost Highway'' that she wrote about her father.&lt;ref name=SamuelGoldwynWritingAwards-Notable-1986&gt;{{cite web|title=Notable Winners: Allison Anders. First Place, 1986|url=http://legacy.tft.ucla.edu/goldwyn/nwinners.cfm|website=[[Samuel Goldwyn Writing Awards]]|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that after writing the script she shared it with her father, and was able to have a relationship with him again.&lt;ref name=PhillyInquirer-GasFood-1992 /&gt;

Anders' first film, the [[punk music]]-heavy ''[[Border Radio]]'', was co-written and co-directed with [[Kurt Voss]] and Dean Lent and was made while they were at UCLA. It was nominated for Best Feature of 1988 by the [[Independent Feature Project]] for Best First Feature.&lt;ref name=Criterion-BorderRadio-2007&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morris|first1=Chris|title=Border Radio: Where Punk Lived|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/461-border-radio-where-punk-lived|website=[[The Criterion Collection]]|accessdate=7 September 2015|date=15 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film told the story of three musicians who stole money owed to them from a job and then fled to Mexico. The story is set amid the Los Angeles punk-rock scene of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Criterion-BorderRadio-2007 /&gt; With a $2,000 contribution from actor [[Vic Tayback]] and loans from Voss's parents to fund the film, the filmmakers made up for the small budget by using local locations and casting performers they knew. For the starring role, they cast Anders' sister, Luanna Anders, and musician [[Chris D.]], as the leading man, as well as Anders' daughter, Devon Anders, who played Luanna's daughter in the film. Violating UCLA policy, the filmmakers cut the film at night in the school's editing bays, while Anders' two young daughters slept on the floor.&lt;ref name=Criterion-BorderRadio-2007 /&gt; In 2007, ''[[Border Radio]]'' was given a special release on DVD as part of the [[Criterion Collection]]&lt;ref name=Criterion-BorderRadio-2007 /&gt; and was lauded as groundbreaking independent cinema.&lt;ref name=LATimes-BorderRadio-2007&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lim|first1=Dennis|title=The fade-out of L.A.'s punk rock scene: 'Border Radio,' a time capsule of underdog mythology, deserves its spot in the history of independent film.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/19/entertainment/et-border19|accessdate=7 September 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=19 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anders' second feature, the 1992 film ''[[Gas Food Lodging]]'', earned her a [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]] and [[National Society of Film Critics]] honors for Best New Director; and nominations from the [[Independent Spirit Awards]] for Best Screenplay and Best Director. Actress [[Fairuza Balk]] won a Spirit Award for her role in the film. The film also won the Deauville Film Festival Critics Award and was also nominated for the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[42nd Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=Berlinale-GasFood-1992&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1992/02_programm_1992/02_Programm_1992.html|title=Berlinale: 1992 Programme|accessdate=24 May 2011|work=[[Berlinale 1992]]|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gas Food Lodging'' is a coming-of-age story about a truck stop waitress and her two daughters, three vibrant, restless women in an isolated Western town.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-GasFood-Review-1992&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maslin|first1=Janet|title=Review/Film -- Gas Food Lodging; Rueful Women, Rootless Men In a Dreary Western Town|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/31/movies/review-film-gas-food-lodging-rueful-women-rootless-men-in-a-dreary-western-town.html|accessdate=7 September 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=31 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplay was loosely adapted by Anders from the novel ''Don't Look and It Won't Hurt'' by [[Richard Peck (writer)|Richard Peck]].&lt;ref name=PhillyInquirer-GasFood-1992 /&gt;

Her next film, ''[[Mi Vida Loca]]'' (''My Crazy Life''), was about girl gangs in the poor Hispanic [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]] neighborhood of Los Angeles, where Anders lived. It premiered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1993, and saw wide release in 1994. The story features a female perspective on growing up in the inner city.

Anders' 1996 film, ''[[Grace of My Heart]]'', was a musical drama executive produced by [[Martin Scorsese]], about a songwriter (played by [[Illeana Douglas]]) and her career over several years, including work in the early 1960s in music publishing and production offices, a setting based on the [[Brill Building]]. This, marriage to a songwriting partner and her emergence as a singer-songwriter in the 1970s are among elements paralleling the career of [[Carole King]], but the film is neither a biography nor entirely fiction. The original soundtrack features new songs written in various styles of the era.&lt;ref name=CreativeScreenwriting-Interview-1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes-GraceHeart-Review-1996&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maslin|first1=Janet|title=One Fine Day at the Brill Building|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/13/movies/one-fine-day-at-the-brill-building.html|accessdate=8 September 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Burt Bacharach]] had their first collaboration composing a song for the film, "God Give Me Strength," and were nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].

In the late 1980s, Anders had become friends with members of pop group [[Duran Duran]], and frequently inserted small references to the band in her films (character names, posters on walls, and so on). In 1999, after bassist [[Nigel John Taylor|John Taylor]] had left Duran Duran and was beginning to launch an acting career, she and Voss co-wrote and co-directed ''[[Sugar Town (film)|Sugar Town]]'', about the Los Angeles film and music industry. The film starred several musical friends of Anders', including Taylor, [[X (U.S. band)|X]] singer [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]], [[Spandau Ballet]] bassist [[Martin Kemp (actor)|Martin Kemp]], and singer/actor [[Michael Des Barres]]. ''Sugar Town'' followed the interconnected lives of a handful of power brokers, wanna-bes and has-beens. Gwen (played by Jade Gordon), a self-centered would-be rock star, is working as an assistant to production designer Liz ([[Ally Sheedy]]); when Gwen discovers Liz has a date with a music producer ([[Larry Klein]]), any loyalty she has to her boss disappears.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-SugarTown-Review-1999&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maslin|first1=Janet|title=Film Review; A Los Angeles Snapshot Of Ashrams and Ambition|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/17/movies/film-review-a-los-angeles-snapshot-of-ashrams-and-ambition.html|accessdate=8 September 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=17 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received two [[Independent Spirit Award]] nominations, for Best Film and Best Newcomer (Jade Gordon). The film also won Anders and Voss the [[Fantasporto]] award for Best Screenplay.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Her 2001 autobiographical film, ''[[Things Behind the Sun]]'',&lt;ref name=Variety-ThingsBehind-Review-2001&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rooney|first1=David|title=Review: 'Things Behind The Sun'|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/markets-festivals/things-behind-the-sun-1200466168/|accessdate=8 September 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=28 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; deals with the long-term aftermath of rape.&lt;ref name=People-ThingsBehindSun-2001 /&gt; It was released on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] cable TV network. The film earned an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nomination for actor [[Don Cheadle]] as Best Supporting Actor; and three [[Independent Spirit Award]] nominations: Cheadle for Best Supporting Actor, [[Kim Dickens]] for Best Actress, and Best Film. Anders and co-writer Kurt Voss also received a nomination for an [[Edgar Award]]. The film was awarded the [[SHINE Award]] as well as the [[Peabody Award]]. ''Things Behind the Sun'' was inspired by an experience Anders had in 1967 when she was raped by group of boys.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-ThingsBehindSun-2001&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weintraub|first1=Bernard|title=Assault as Autobiography; A Filmmaker Draws on Her Memories of Being Raped at 12|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/07/movies/assault-as-autobiography-a-filmmaker-draws-on-her-memories-of-being-raped-at-12.html|accessdate=8 September 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=7 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anders actually shot some of the film in the same location in [[Cocoa Beach, Florida|Cocoa Beach]], [[Florida]], where the gang rape occurred.&lt;ref name=People-ThingsBehindSun-2001 /&gt;

Anders' 2012 film, ''Strutter'', co-directed with Voss, completed a loose trilogy of films about Southern California musicians that began with ''Border Radio'' and ''Sugar Town.'' A black-and-white road picture, the film featured Luanna Anders from ''Border Radio'', a scene in the motel room where [[Gram Parsons]] died, and a score with music by [[Ariel Pink]] and [[J Mascis]].&lt;ref name=Variety-Strutter-Review-2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harvey|first1=Dennis|title=Review: 'Strutter'|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/reviews/strutter-1117948600/|accessdate=8 September 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was funded by a [[Kickstarter]] campaign.&lt;ref name=Kickstarter-Strutter&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anders|first1=Allison|title="Strutter" a film by Allison Anders &amp; Kurt Voss|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/strutter/strutter-a-film-by-allison-anders-and-kurt-voss|website=[[Kickstarter]]|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Anders released the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]]-produced TV movie ''Ring of Fire'', a [[June Carter Cash]] biopic that featured the musician [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]]. The film was inspired by [[John Carter Cash]]'s book, ''[[Anchored in Love: A Tribute to June Carter Cash]]''.&lt;ref name=Variety-RingofFire-2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Christopher|title=Allison Anders, Jewel Sing June Carter Cash's Praises|url=https://variety.com/2013/music/news/allison-anders-jewel-sing-june-carter-cashs-praises-1200486129/|accessdate=8 September 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Anders began directing shows for broadcast and cable television in 1999, including several episodes in the second and third seasons of ''[[Sex and the City]]'', as well as episodes of ''[[Grosse Pointe (TV series)|Grosse Pointe]]'', ''[[Cold Case]]'', ''[[The L Word]]'', ''[[Men In Trees]]'', ''[[The Mentalist]]'', and ''[[What About Brian?]]''

In 2011, she directed an episode of the [[John Wells (filmmaker)|John Wells]] production, ''[[Southland (TV series)|Southland]]'', which involved a car chase scene.&lt;ref name=SouthLAndFirst-Fallout-2012&gt;{{cite web|last1=SouthLAnd First|title=Exclusive interview with "Fallout" director Allison Anders|url=http://www.southlandfirst.com/2012/03/exclusive-interview-with-fallout.html|website=SouthLAnd First|accessdate=14 September 2015|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anders directed an episode of ''[[Turn: Washington's Spies]]'', which was especially interesting to her because she has distant relatives on both sides of her family who were spies for [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name=BlitterBaroque-Dad-2015 /&gt;

===Other work===
In 2013, Anders interviewed 94-year-old actress and Hollywood legend [[Marge Champion]], who appeared at a 2013 [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] film festival screening of 1968 cult film ''[[The Swimmer (1968 film)|The Swimmer]]'', which starred [[Burt Lancaster]]. The interview was featured among [[Making-of|behind-the-scenes]] supplementary material on a 2014 Blu-ray/DVD release of the film by [[Grindhouse Releasing]]/Box Office Spectaculars Blu-ray/DVD restoration of the film.&lt;ref name=FilmScoreMonthly-MargeChampionInterview-2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dursin |first1=Andy |title=Aisle Seat 3-25: The Swimmer, Wolf of Wall Street |url=http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/daily/article.cfm/articleID/7067/Aisle-Seat-3-25--The-Swimmer-Wolf-of-Wall-Street/ |website=[[Film Score Monthly]] |accessdate=7 September 2015 |date=24 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713151526/http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/daily/article.cfm/articleID/7067/Aisle-Seat-3-25--The-Swimmer-Wolf-of-Wall-Street/ |archivedate=13 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anders and her musician daughter, Tiffany Anders, started the Don't Knock the Rock Film and Music Festival in 2003 in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=Musicfilmweb-DontKnockRock-2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Markowitz|first1=Andy|title=Allison and Tiffany Anders: Don't Knock the Rock, Around the Clock|url=http://www.musicfilmweb.com/2013/08/allison-anders-tiffany-anders-music-documentary-festival/|accessdate=8 September 2015|work=[[Musicfilmweb]]|date=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, she appeared in the road-trip documentary ''[[Wanderlust (2006 film)|Wanderlust]]''. Anders has also contributed to the [[web series]] ''[[Trailers from Hell]].''

In 2013, Anders bid on and won a rock and roll record collection formerly owned by the actress [[Greta Garbo]]. She created a website called "Greta's Records" to curate and share the collection of 50 records.&lt;ref name=GretasRecords-2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Greta's Records By Allison Anders|url=http://gretasrecords.tumblr.com/post/41091307875/gretas-records-by-allison-anders|website=Greta's Records By Allison Anders|accessdate=8 September 2015|date=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term associations===
Anders counts filmmaker [[Wim Wenders]] as a mentor. She started as a fan, sending him letters and music, and Wenders eventually responded. Anders said that she created a faux grant that she "won" so that she and at least one other friend could study under Wenders on location for his film ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]].'' They have been friends for over 30 years.&lt;ref name=Talkhouse-Anders-Wenders-SkypePodcast-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anders|first1=Allison|last2=Wenders|first2=Wim|title=Allison Anders (Grace of My Heart) Talks with Wim Wenders (Paris, Texas) for The Talkhouse Film Podcast|url=http://thetalkhouse.com/film/talks/allison-anders-grace-of-my-heart-talks-with-wim-wenders-paris-texas-for-the-talkhouse-film-podcast/|accessdate=10 September 2015|work=The Talkhouse|date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
In 2003, Anders became a Distinguished Professor at the [[University of California Santa Barbara]], where she teaches in the Film And Media Studies Department one quarter each year. She has taught courses on topics including autobiographic writing, rock and roll films, and music supervision.&lt;ref name=UCSB-ProfessorProfile /&gt;

'''''Andromeda Chained to the Rocks''''' (1630) is a 34 x 25 oil on panel painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Rembrandt]]. It is now in the [[Mauritshuis]],  [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]. Andromeda represents Rembrandt's first full length mythological female nude [[history painting]] and is taken from a story in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.

==Mythology==
In Metamorphoses, [[Andromeda (mythology)]] is the daughter of an Ethiopian king and queen, [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]]. Cassiopeia was very boastful about her beauty, and asserted that she was more beautiful than [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], the queen of the gods and the Nereids. Insulted by Cassiopeia's assertions, [[Neptune]] sent a sea monster to the Ethiopian coast. Neptune then could only be appeased upon the sacrifice of Andromeda, the kings beautiful virgin daughter, to the sea monster. Andromeda was chained naked to rocks by the coast, awaiting the sea monster. [[Perseus]], passing by, had noticed the beautiful girl and made a deal with her parents that he would save her, should he be allowed to have her hand in marriage. The king and queen agree and Andromeda was spared.&lt;ref name="Ovid, book iv, myth ix"&gt;Ovid, book iv, myth ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Damsel in distress==
This painting depicts a classic example of the [[damsel in distress]]. In this theme a beautiful young woman is placed in a perilous situation, usually involving a monster or being trapped in captivity. The damsel can then only be rescued by a hero, whom of which she usually ends up marrying. In this painting, Andromeda has a distressed look on her face as she is completely shackled and unable to move. Although Perseus does not make an appearance in this painting, in similar works we can see Perseus being portrayed in a heroic and graceful light, shown through the use of warm colors and heroic poses.

==Depiction of beauty==
Many artists such as [[Titian]] have depicted this story by showing [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], her rescuer Perseus, and the sea monster all in the same composition. Her beauty as described in her source material can be seen in some of these other works, along with Perseus' role as her rescuer. In this work, Rembrandt shies away from classical conventions by showing her not as a glamorous beauty but as a frightened naturalistic looking girl.  No other figure is included, but her alarmed look out of the picture space to the right creates narrative tension.  The painting is an example of Rembrandt's rejection of idealized beauty. Since he did not believe true beauty existed naturally, he painted women as he saw them; naturally imperfect and flawed.&lt;ref name="Clark, p. 11"&gt;Clark, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Rembrandt's subsequent nude mythological paintings from this period ''[[Diana Bathing with her Nymphs with Actaeon and Callisto|Diana Bathing]]'' and ''[[Danaë (Rembrandt painting)|Danaë]]'' show his evolving portrayal of the nude.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2295">The '''Anglo-French Art Centre''' (or '''Anglo-French Art School''', previously the [[St John's Wood Art School]], was an [[art school]] in [[St John's Wood]], north [[London]], England.

The original St John's Wood Art School dated from 1878.&lt;ref name="isaaman"&gt;{{cite web| title=Feature: Exhibition- Rediscovery of a chapter in London's art history — St John’s Wood Art School and The Anglo-French Art Centre — Boundary Gallery | url=http://www.camdennewjournal.com/feature-exhibition-rediscovery-chapter-londons-art-history-st-john%E2%80%99s-wood-art-school-and-anglo-frenc | date=11 November 2010

The centre was founded by [[Alfred Rozelaar Green]], who studied in [[Paris]] at the [[Académie Julian]] and Atelier Gromaire before the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Anglo-French Art Centre | url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/schools/anglo-french-art-centre | publisher=Art Biographies, UK | accessdate=21 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to London at the end of the war. Afterwards in 1946, Green established the centre at 29 Elm Tree Road in St John's Wood. Green aimed to revolutionise British [[art education]]. He invited artists from [[France]] and other countries to exhibit and teach. Artists included [[Robert Couturier (1905–2008)|Robert Couturier]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[André Lhote]], [[Jean Lurçat]], Agnès Capri and [[Germaine Richier]]. He was also supported by English artists who visited to give lectures, including [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Victor Pasmore]] and [[Julian Trevelyan]]. Other lecturers included [[art critic]]s and [[museum director]]s. The centre closed in 1951.&lt;ref name="isaaman" /&gt;

{{Culture of the Philippines}}
The '''art of the Philippines''' refers to the works of [[art]] that have developed and accumulated in the [[Philippines]] from the beginning of civilization in the country up to the present era. It reflects to its society and non-Filipinos the wide range of cultural influences on the country's culture and how these influences honed the country's arts. The art of the Philippines can be divided into two distinct branches, namely, traditional arts, and non-traditional arts. Each branch is further divided into various categories with subcategories.

[[File:Kutkut.jpg|thumb|''Kut-kut'' is a technique combining ancient Oriental and European art process. Considered lost art and highly collectible art form. Very few known art pieces existed today. The technique was practiced by the indigenous people of [[Samar|Samar Island]] between early 1600 and late 1800 AD. ''Kut-kut'' is an exotic Philippine art form based on early century techniques—[[sgraffito]], encaustic and layering. The merging of these ancient styles produces a unique artwork characterized by delicate swirling interwoven lines, multi-layered texture and an illusion of three-dimensional space.|181x181px]]

===Hindu-Buddhist iconography===

Many of historians believed that the various cultures of the Philippine archipelago first encountered Hindu and/or Buddhist beliefs as early as the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE,&lt;ref name="Jocano2001" /&gt; but some of recent scholarship suggests that these cultural influences mostly filtered in during the 10th through the early 14th centuries. Present-day scholarship believes these religious and cultural influences mostly came through trade with Southeast Asian thassalocratic empires such as the [[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit]], which had in turn had trade relationships with India.&lt;ref name="Jocano2001"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Jocano  | first = F.

Scholars such as [[Milton Osborne]] emphasise that despite these beliefs being originally from India, they reached the Philippines through Southeast Asian cultures with Austronesian roots.&lt;ref name="Osborne2004"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Osborne  | first = Milton  | authorlink = Milton Osborne  | title = Southeast Asia: An Introductory History  | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin  | date = 2004  | location = Australia  | pages =  | volume =  | edition = Ninth  | url =  | doi =  | id =    | isbn = 1-74114-448-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artifacts reflect the iconography of the [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] and its influences on the Philippines' early states.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo Legeza, "Tantric Elements in the Philippines PreHispanic Gold Arts," Arts of Asia, 1988, 4:129–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The copper [[Buddha]]'s of [[Ma-i]] (metal relics) – "The gentleness of Tagalog customs that the first Spaniards found, very different from those of other provinces of the same race and in Luzon itself, can very well be the effect of Buddhism "There are copper Buddha's" images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Political and Historical Writings (Vol. 7) | publisher=National Historical Institute | author=Rizal, Jose | year=2000 | location=Manila}}&lt;/ref&gt; the people in Ma-i sound like newcomers [to this port] since they don't know where those metal statues in the jungle come from."&lt;ref&gt;Prehispanic Source Materials: for the study of Philippine History" (Published by New Day Publishers, Copyright 1984) Written by William Henry Scott, Page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological findings show that before the settlement of the Spaniards in the country, the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]s, especially the ''Batangueños'', had attained a semblance of high civilization. This was shown by certain jewelry, made from a chambered nautilus' shell, where tiny holes were created by a drill-like tool. The ancient Batangueños were influenced by [[India]] as shown in the origin of most languages from Sanskrit and certain ancient potteries. A Buddhist image was reproduced in mould on a clay medallion in bas-relief from the municipality of Calatagan. According to experts, the image in the pot strongly resembles the iconographic portrayal of Buddha in [[Thailand|Siam]], India, and [[Nepal]]. The pot shows [[Buddha|Buddha Amithaba]] in the [[tribhanga]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yet.typepad.com/round_dice/2006/02/tribhanga_strik.html|title= tribhanga|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; pose inside an oval nimbus. Scholars also noted that there is a strong [[Mahayana|Mahayanic]] orientation in the image, since the Boddhisattva [[Avalokitesvara]] was also depicted.&lt;ref&gt;http://asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-01-01-1963/Francisco%20Buddhist.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The archipelagos of Southeast Asia were under the influence of Hindu [[Tamils|Tamil]], [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] and Indonesian traders through the ports of [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Malay-Indonesian]] islands. Indian religions, possibly an amalgamated version of Hindu-Buddhist arrived in the Philippine archipelago in the 1st millennium, through the Indonesian kingdom of Srivijaya, followed by Majapahit. Archaeological evidence suggesting exchange of ancient spiritual ideas from India to the Philippines includes the 1.79 kilogram, 21 carat gold Hindu goddess Agusan (sometimes referred to as [[Golden Tara]]), found in [[Mindanao]] in 1917 after a storm and flood exposed its location.&lt;ref name=govppn&gt;[http://agusandelsur.gov.ph/index/using-joomla/extensions/components/content-component/article-categories/78-demo/slides/80-golden-tara Golden Tara] Government of the Philippines&lt;/ref&gt; The statue now sits in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in Chicago, and is dated from the period 13th to early 14th centuries.

{{Quote|A study of this image was made by Dr. F. D. K. Bosch, of Batavia, in 1920, who came to the conclusion that it was made by local workmen in Mindanao, copying a Ngandjuk image of the early Majapahit period – except that the local artist overlooked the distinguishing attributes held in the hand. It probably had some connection with the Javanese miners who are known to have been mining gold in the Agusan-Surigao area in the middle or late 14th century. The image is apparently that of a [[Shaivism|Sivaite goddess]], and fits in well with the name "[[Butuan]]" (signifying "[[Lingam|phallus]]").|[[H. Otley Beyer]]|1947&lt;ref name=ob&gt;H. Otley Beyer, "Outline Review of Philippine Archaeology by Islands and Provinces," Philippine Journal of Science, Vol.77,Nos.34 (July–August 1947),pp. 205–374&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Juan Francisco]] suggests that the golden Agusan statue may be a representation of goddess [[Shakti|Sakti]] of the Siva-Buddha ([[Bhairava]]) tradition found in [[Java]], in which the religious aspect of [[Shiva]] is integrated with those found in Buddhism of Java and [[Sumatra]]. The [[Rajahnate of Butuan]], in present-day [[Agusan del Norte]] and Butuan City, used Hinduism as its main religion along with indigenous [[Lumad]] nature-worships. A Hindu Tamil King of the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] was also recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Francisco (1963), ''A Note on the Golden Image of Agusan'', Philippine Studies vol. 11, no. 3 (1963): 390—400&lt;/ref&gt; Another gold artifact, from the [[Tabon Caves]] in the island of [[Palawan]], is an image of [[Garuda]], the bird who is the mount of [[Vishnu]]. The discovery of sophisticated Hindu imagery and gold artifacts in Tabon Caves has been linked to those found from [[Oc Eo]], in the [[Mekong Delta]] in Southern [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=atnb/&gt; These archaeological evidence suggests an active trade of many specialized goods and gold between India and Philippines and coastal regions of [[Vietnam]] and China. Golden jewelry found so far include rings, some surmounted by images of [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] – the sacred bull, linked chains, inscribed gold sheets, gold plaques decorated with repoussé images of Hindu deities.&lt;ref name=atnb&gt;Anna T. N. Bennett (2009), [http://archeosciences.revues.org/2072 Gold in early Southeast Asia], ArcheoSciences, Volume 33, pp 99–107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dang V.T. and Vu, Q.H., 1977. The excavation at Giong Ca Vo site. Journal of Southeast Asian Archaeology 17: 30–37&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, a laborer working in a sand mine at the mouth of Lumbang River near [[Laguna de Bay]] found a copper plate in Barangay Wawa, [[Lumban, Laguna|Lumban]].&lt;ref name=govppn/&gt; This discovery, is now known as the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] by scholars. It is the earliest known written document found in the Philippines, dated to be from the late 9th century CE, and was deciphered in 1992 by Dutch anthropologist [[Antoon Postma]].&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; The copperplate inscription suggests economic and cultural links between the Tagalog people of Philippines with the Javanese [[Medang Kingdom]], the Srivijaya empire, and the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of India. Hinduism in the country declined when [[Islam]] was introduced by traders from [[Arabia]] which was then followed by Christianity from Spain.&lt;ref name=govppn/&gt; This is an active area of research as little is known about the scale and depth of Philippine history from the 1st millennium and before.

===Lingling-o===
[[File:Lingling-o-X3.jpg|thumb|Three designs of Lingling-o at the [[Musée du quai Branly - Jacques Chirac|Musée du quai Branly]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].]]
The Lingling-o (sometimes also spelled "ling-ling-o") are an "omega shaped"&lt;ref name="Zafra2008"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/art-exhibit-philippines-gold-ancestors-86249 |title=Art Exhibit: Philippines' 'Gold of Ancestors' |last=Zafra |first=Jessica |date=2008-04-26 |work=Newsweek |access-date=2017-12-27 |language=en |author-link=Jessica Zafra}}&lt;/ref&gt; type of pendant or amulet that has been associated with various indigenous cultures of the Philippines since the early metal age.&lt;ref name="NationalMuseumCollections2011"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Lingling-o.html |title=National Museum Collections: Ling-ling O |website=Official Website National Museum of the Philippines (Beta Website) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111085026/http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Lingling-o.html |archive-date=2011-11-11 |dead-url=No |access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest surviving examples of lingling-o, dating back to the metal age, were made out of Nephrite jade, but many later examples were made of shell, gold, copper, and wood;&lt;ref name="NationalMuseumCollections2011"/&gt; the kind of material suggests differences in the social standing of its wearer.&lt;ref name="NationalMuseumCollections2011"/&gt;  The term was first popularized by H. Otley Beyer, who adapted it from the Southern Ifugao name for such ornaments.&lt;ref name="Apostol2010"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?isbn=1556439415 |title=Way of the Ancient Healer: Sacred Teachings from the Philippine Ancestral Traditions |last=Apostol |first=Virgil Mayor |publisher=North Atlantic Books |year=2010 |isbn=1556439415 |edition=2010 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term has since also come to be used as a blanket term for various metal age ornaments found in the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Apostol2010"/&gt;

====Batanes workshop site====
Earlier historians have posited that the earliest lingling-o artifacts found in the Philippines were created outside of the archipelago, but an expedition to the northern Philippine province of [[Batanes]], led by archeologist [[Peter Bellwood]] in the early 2000s, led to the discovery of a lingling-o workshop, complete with construction tools and fragments. The find provides evidence of indigenous Philippine manufacture of lingling-o as early as 2,500 years ago.&lt;ref name="Zafra2008"/&gt;

===Architecture===

{{see|Nipa hut|Bahay na bato|Earthquake Baroque}}
{{Main|Architecture of the Philippines}}
The vernacular architecture of the Philippines is diverse and developed according to the traditions, history and influences exposure experienced by each culture or society. They ranged from simple [[Nipa hut|''Bahay Kubo'']] which is the basis of all Filipino cultural architecture which gave way to houses like ''[[Bahay na bato]]'', up to the palaces such as [[Torogan]]s, fortifications like the Classical Kota's and [[Idjang]]s, Colonial Forts and mega structure such as [[Banaue Rice Terraces]] which is built from carving of the mountain walls, and Mosques in [[Mindanao]]. Architectures like Baroque was adopted to the Filipino culture, making their own interpretation through the Filipino culture climate and environment. One of the product of Filipino Baroque is the [[Earthquake Baroque]], which is especially designed to adapt to the earthquake prone environment of the Philippines.

===Weaving===
[[File:Philippine life in town and country (1905) (14788738333).jpg|thumb|right|A Filipino loom for weaving rough fabrics of abaka fiber, 1905.]]
Philippine weaving involves many threads being measured, cut, and mounted on a wooden platform. The threads are dyed and weaved on a loom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Banton.html |title=Banton Cloth : Age of Contact : Banton Is., Romblon |publisher=Nationalmuseum.gov.ph |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Spanish colonization, native Filipinos weaved using fibers from abaca, pineapple, cotton, and bark cloth. Textiles, clothes, rugs, and hats were weaved. Baskets were also weaved and used as vessels of transport and storage, and for hunting. These baskets were used to transport grain, store food, and catching fish.&lt;ref name="slideshare1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Trish Sotto |url=http://www.slideshare.net/TrishSotto/fa-28-weaving-history |title=Fa 28 weaving history |publisher=Slideshare.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They also used weaving to make just about all of the clothing that was worn. They weaved rugs that they used for quilts and bedding. The quality of the quilt/bedding was based on how soft, how tight together, and the clean pattern. The patterns were usually thick stripes with different colors and with a nice pattern.

However, during Spanish colonization, Filipinos used fabric called nipis to weave white clothing. These were weaved with decorative, flower designs.&lt;ref name="slideshare1"/&gt;

===Painting===
{{Main|List of Filipino painters}}
Prehistoric cave drawings were discovered in numbers of sites in Philippines. The notable ones are those in [[Angono Petroglyphs]] is located in a shallow rock shelter. It measures 63 meters wide, 8 meters deep and a maximum height of 5 meters. It has been created due to faulting and formed in volcanic soil during the Quaternary period. There are 127 drawings in the form of animate and static figures of circular or dome-like head on top of a 'V' shaped torso distributed on a horizontal plane on the rock wall area measuring 25 meters by 3 meters. Only 51 of the total 127 drawings are distinct. Due to the complexity and plurality of the drawings, it is suggested that the drawings on the rock were not only created by a single individual. the figures engraved on the rockwall probably carved during the late Neolithic, or before 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5018/|title=Petroglyphs and Petrographs of the Philippines - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These inscriptions clearly show stylized human figures, frogs and lizards, along with other designs that may have depicted other interesting figures but erosion may have caused it to become indistinguishable. The engravings are mostly symbolic representations and are associated with healing and sympathetic magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artesdelasfilipinas.com/archives/152/the-angono-binangonan-petroglyphs/|title=The Angono-Binangonan Petroglyphs : Philippine Art, Culture and Antiquities|website=www.artesdelasfilipinas.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic paintings were introduced to Filipinos in the 16th century when the Spaniards arrived in the Philippines. During this time, the Spaniards used paintings as visual aid for their religious propaganda to spread Catholicism throughout the Philippines. These paintings, appearing mostly on church walls, featured religious figures appearing in Catholic teachings. In short, due to the Spanish occupation of the Philippines and the Church's supervision of Filipino art, the purpose of most paintings in the Philippines from the 16th to the 19th century were to aid the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="wiziq1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiziq.com/tutorial/159187-HISTORY-OF-PHILIPPINE-PAINTING |title=History Of Philippine Painting |publisher=Wiziq.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, wealthier, educated Filipinos introduced more secular Filipino art, causing art in the Philippines to deviate from religious motifs. The use of watercolour paintings increased and the subject matter of paintings began to include landscapes, Filipino inhabitants, Philippine fashion, and government officials. Portrait paintings featured the painters themselves, Filipino jewelry, and native furniture. The subject of landscape paintings featured artists' names painted ornately as well as day-to-day scenes of average Filipinos partaking in their daily tasks. These paintings were done on canvas, wood, and a variety of metals.&lt;ref name="wiziq1"/&gt;

During World War II, some painters focused their artwork on the effects of war, including battle scenes, destruction, and the suffering of the Filipino people.

===Calligraphy===
{{Main|Suyat|Calligraphy}}
The Philippines has numerous indigenous scripts collectively called as [[suyat]]. Various ethno-linguistic groups in the Philippines prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century up to the independence era in the 21st century have used the scripts with various mediums. By the end of colonialism, only four of the suyat scripts survived and continue to be used by certain communities in everyday life. These four scripts are [[Hanunó'o alphabet|hanunó'o/hanunoo]] of the Hanuno'o [[Mangyan]] people, [[Buhid alphabet|buhid/buid]] of the Buhid [[Mangyan]] people, [[Tagbanwa script|apurahuano/tagbanwa]] of the [[Tagbanwa people]], and [[Palawan people|palaw'an/pala'wan]] of the [[Palawan people|Palaw'an people]]. All four scripts were inscribed in the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Programme]], under the name ''Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala’wan)'', in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-7/philippine-paleographs-hanunoo-buid-tagbanua-and-palawan/|title=Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala’wan) - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to dissent from colonialism, many artists and cultural experts have revived the usage of suyat scripts that went extinct due to Spanish persecution. These scripts being revived include the [[Kulitan alphabet|kulitan]] script of the [[Kapampangan people]], the [[Visayan languages|badlit]] script of various [[Visayans|Visayan ethnic groups]], the [[Eskaya|iniskaya]] script of the [[Eskaya people]], the [[baybayin]] script of the [[Tagalog people]], and the [[Ilocano language|kur-itan]] script of the [[Ilocano people]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/201104-baybayin-national-writing-system-reactions|title=‘Educate first’: Filipinos react to Baybayin as national writing system|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1602707/Manila/Local-News/House-panel-approves-Baybayin-as-national-writing-system|title=House panel approves Baybayin as national writing system|date=24 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/04/25/18/5-things-to-know-about-phs-pre-hispanic-writing-system|title=5 things to know about PH's pre-Hispanic writing system|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraphy using the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are also prevalent in the Philippines due to its colonial past, but the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are not considered as suyat, and therefore Western alphabet and Arabic calligraphy are not considered as suyat calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/artandculture/577701/a-primer-on-baybayin/story/|title=A primer on Baybayin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnphilippines.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/2018/04/26/baybayin-bill.html|title=The Baybayin bill and the never ending search for ‘Filipino-ness’|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://brideandbreakfast.ph/2015/08/12/awesome-calligraphers/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/2018/06/01/1820721/watch-how-ace-script-lettering&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sealing and Papermaking===
{{Main|Seal (East Asia)}}
[[File:Ivory seal of Butuan.jpg|thumb|The [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], dated 1002 AD, housed and displayed at the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]] in [[Manila]].]]
Like [[Mongolia]], [[Taiwan]], [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], the Philippines also had a sealing culture prior to Spanish colonization, which is reasonable as the Philippines is within the [[Sinosphere]], or East Asian cultural sphere. However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]].&lt;ref name="filipiknow.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filipiknow.net/national-museum-of-the-philippines/|title=12 Astonishing Artifacts You Didn't Know You Could Find At The National Museum|date=5 June 2015|website=Filipiknow.net|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word "''Butwan''" through a native [[Suyat|Suyat script]]. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and palm leaves (''lontar'') for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Dr. [[H. Otley Beyer]], father of Philippine anthropology, stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''suyat'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, calligraphy, and literary works. Additionally, traditional handmade paper-making practices using native fibers, such as abaca, cogon, and pina have been revived by numerous organizations throughout the country.&lt;ref name="NMPHseal"&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html National Museum Collections Seals]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://members.cruzio.com/~peteranddonna/2-phil.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sculpture===
The religion of the [[Ifugao people]] is based on ancestor worship and the veneration of spirits and gods of nature. Rice deities are particularly revered. These bululs are activated through ritual, the bulol guardian figures are believed to contain spirits capable of ensuring abundant harvests, increasing rice yields and protecting against catastrophe. Shaped like a rice mortar, the distinctive base of the sculpture is a visual link to its spiritual purpose. The pairing of male with female is a fundamental feature of Cordilleras ancestral art. These [[Bulul]] guardians represent the harmonious union of opposing elements, the protection of communities from malevolent spirits and the promise of good fortune. Carved from auspicious red sandalwood, these sculptures are differentiated by their distinct genitalia, alluding to fertility and abundance. The figures have a rich patina of sacrificial blood and smoke resulting from their use in religious practice and life-cycle ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cordilleranmuseum.weebly.com/gallery-of-exhibits.html|title=Museum of Cordilleran Sculpture - Gallery of Exhibits|website=cordilleranmuseum.weebly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Bulul is a carved wooden figure used to guard the rice crop by the [[Ifugao people|Ifugao (and their sub-tribe Kalanguya)]] peoples of northern [[Luzon]]. The sculptures are highly stylized representations of ancestors, and are thought to gain power from the presence of the ancestral spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Ifugao are particularly noted for their skill in carving bululs.&lt;ref name="Woods2006" /&gt; Bul-uls are used in ceremonies associated with rice production and with healing.
Creation of a bul-ul involves alwen bul-ul ritual by a priest to ensure that the statue gains power. The bul-ul is treated with care and respect to avoid the risk of the spirits of the ancestors bringing sickness.
The figures are placed together with the rice in the house or granaries to bring a plentiful harvest.
Bul-ul is important to Ifugaos because they believe they can protect and multiply the rice and help make the harvest abundant.

The [[Sarimanok]] is a legendary bird of the [[Maranao people]] who originate from [[Mindanao]]. It comes from the words ''sari'' and ''manok''. ''Sari'' means cloth or garment, which is generally of assorted colors. ''Manok'' means "chicken". The Sarimanok is the legendary bird that has become an ubiquitous symbol of Maranao art. It is depicted as a fowl with colorful wings and feathered tail, holding a fish on its beak or talons. The head is profusely decorated with scroll, leaf, and spiral motifs. It is said to be a symbol of good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ph.net/htdocs/education/sarimano.htm Philippine Arts and Culture: Sarimanok].

The Prophet Muhammad rode the Buraq to fly through the heavens in a single night, a journey known as Mir'aj. Only in certain regions, such as Mindanao, is the animal depicted with a human face. Although the Buraq is not uncommon in Islamic art, sculptures of the creature seem to be unique to the Philippines. It is possible that the flourishing carving industry of religious images for Catholic Filipinos may have encouraged the making of such sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://discover.acm.stqry.com/v/foyer-islamic-world/s/a7f9f07b-8e37-4de7-87b9-ecfc4814688c|title=Buraq - Asian Civilisations Museum|first=Area360|last=Inc.|website=discover.acm.stqry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performing arts==
===Dance===
{{main|Philippine dance}}
[[File:Filipino folk dancers Pistahan festival.jpg|thumb|right|Filipino folk dancers performing at the Pistahan Festival in [[San Francisco, California]].]]
There are numerous types of Filipino dances, varying in influence, from the country's regions. Types of Filipino dance include Cordillera, Muslim, tribal, rural, and Spanish style dances. Jerrah is the most well known kind of dance in the cordillera region.
Within the Cordilleras' dances, there are the Banga, Bendayan, Lumagen/Tachok, Manmanok, Ragragsakan, Salisid, Talip, Tarektek, and Uyaoy/Uyauy. The Banga dance shows the grace and strength of women in the Kalinga tribe. Women performing the Banga balance heavy pots on their heads while dancing to beat of wind chimes. This mimics Kalinga women collecting and transporting water. Another dance, called Lumagen or Tachok, is performed to celebrate happy occasions. When Lumagen is performed, it is meant to symbolize flying birds and is musically paired to the beat of gongs. Another cordillera dance, Salisid, is the dance to show courtship. In the Salisid dance, a male and a female performer represent a rooster attempting to attract a hen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/Tagalog/Cynthia/philippine_dances_cordillera.htm |title=Philippine Dances Cordillera |publisher=Seasite.niu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Igorrote men performing a War Dance, A-Y-P, 1909.jpg|thumb|left|[[Igorot people|Igorot]] men performing a [[war dance]], c. 1909.]]
Tribal dances include Malakas at Maganda, Kadal Blelah, Kadal Tahaw, Binaylan, Bagobo Rice Cycle, and Dugso. Malakas at Maganda is a national folklore dance. It tells the story of the origin of the Filipino people on the islands. Another dance, called the Binaylan dance, tells the story of a hen, the hen's baby, and a hawk. In this dance, the hawk is said to control a tribe's well-being, and is killed by hunters after attempting to harm the hen's baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/Tagalog/Cynthia/dances/tribal_dances.htm |title=tribal dances |publisher=Seasite.niu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two examples of traditional Filipino dances are [[Tinikling]] and [[Binasuan]] and many more. Filipinos have unique [[folk dances]] like tinikling where assistants take two long bamboo sticks rapidly and in rhythm, clap sticks for dancers to artistically and daringly try to avoid getting their feet caught between them. Also in the southern part of the Philippines, there is another dance called [[Singkil]] using long bamboo poles found in tinikling; however, it is primarily a dance showing off lavish Muslim royalty. In this dance, there are four bamboo sticks arranged in a [[tic-tac-toe]] pattern in which the dancers exploit every position of these clashing sticks. Dancers can be found trying to avoid all 4 bamboo sticks all together in the middle. They can also try to dance an entire rotation around the middle avoiding all sticks. Usually these stick dances performed in teamwork fashion not solo. The Singkil dance is identifiable with the use of umbrellas and silk clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinfonia.or.jp/~infortec/hotspots/boracay/singkil.htm|title=Hot Spots Filipino Cultural Dance - Singkil|publisher=Sinfonia.or.jp|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many towns have their own versions of the [[Holy Week in the Philippines#Senákulo|''Senakulo'']], using traditional scripts that are decades or centuries old. A version is held at the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]], sponsored by the [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Department of Tourism]]. Popular film and televisions stars often join the cast of the play. In Taguig, they popularize the modern version of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' reshown at the Fort Santiago Amphitheater for the benefit of Manileños. In [[Mexico, Pampanga]] and [[Dinalupihan, Bataan]], the actor portraying Jesus has been actually nailed to the cross to simulate Christ's passion as best and as painfully possible. Similar shows are also held in Makati and in the [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana district]] of Manila.

==Martial arts==
[[File:Grandmaster Jerry Dela Cruz.png|thumb|146px|right|[[Arnis]], a well known [[Filipino martial art]] which emphasize weapon-based fighting with the use of sticks.]]
The [[Arnis]], also known as '''Kali''' or '''Eskrima''', is the [[national sport]] and martial art of the Philippines. The three are roughly interchangeable umbrella terms for the traditional [[martial arts]] of the [[Philippines]] ("[[Filipino Martial Arts]]", or FMA) that emphasize [[martial arts weapons|weapon-based fighting]] with [[stick fighting|sticks]], [[knife fighting|knives]], [[bladed weapon]]s and various [[improvised weapon]]s as well as "open hand" or techniques without weapons. It is also known as ''Estoque'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for [[rapier]]), ''Estocada'' (Spanish for thrust or stab) and ''Garrote'' (Spanish for club). In [[Luzon]] they may go by the name of ''Arnis de Mano''.The indigenous martial art that the Spanish encountered in 1610 was not yet called "Eskrima" at that time. During those times, this martial art was known as ''Paccalicali-t'' to the [[Ibanags]],&lt;ref name="epanolIbanag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books/reader?id=6WE2AQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;source=ebookstore&amp;pg=GBS.PA223|title=Diccionario español-ibanag o sea Tesauro Hispano- Cagayán sacado de los manuscritos antiguos|author=Ramirez y Giraudier|date=1867|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Didya''  (later changed to ''Kabaroan'') to the [[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]], ''Sitbatan'' or ''Kalirongan'' to [[Pangasinan people|Pangasinenses]], ''Sinawali'' ("to weave") to the [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangans]], ''Calis'' or ''Pananandata'' (use of weapons) to the [[Tagalogs]], ''Pagaradman'' to the [[Hiligaynon people|Ilonggos]] and ''Kaliradman'' to the [[Cebuano people|Cebuanos]].

Traditional pot-making in certain areas of the Philippines would use clay found near the Sibalom River. Molding the clay required the use of wooden paddles, and the clay had to be kept away from sunlight.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/library/webliography/subject/philippine_pottery.asp |title=De La Salle University : University Library : Philippine Pottery |publisher=Dlsu.edu.ph |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120155800/http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/library/webliography/subject/philippine_pottery.asp |archivedate=2012-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other pottery used to hold remains of the deceased were decorated with anthropomorphic designs. These anthropomorphic earthenware pots date back to 5 BC. - 225 A.D and had pot covers shaped like human heads.&lt;ref name="nationalmuseum1"/&gt;

Filipino pottery had other uses as well. During the Neolithic period of the Philippines, pottery was made for water vessels, plates, cups, and for many other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.ph/permanenttraveling.php?page=classicalgoldwork |title=Metropolitan Museum of Manila, Philippines: Art for All |publisher=Metmuseum.ph |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kalinga Pottery''' &lt;ref name=archaeo2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skibo|first1=J.|title=Pottery Function: A use-alteration perspective|date=1992|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceramic vessels of Kalinga are divided into three types: rice cooking (ittoyom), vegetable/meat cooking (oppaya), and water storage (immosso) pots. According to Skibo, the rice cooking pots are usually larger, thinner and have a smaller opening than vegetable/meat pots. On the other hand, water storage pots have an average and uniform size and a smaller neck size.

Except for water storage pots, which have a uniform size, the other two kinds can come in three different sizes, large, medium and small. Although this is true in some cases, another larger type of vegetable/meat pot and smaller water storage pot exists.

• Manufacture of Kalinga potteries
[[File:Annual report of the Director to the Board of Trustees for the year .. (1910) (18246004349).jpg|thumb|360x360px|A group of Igorot pottery makers from Samoki, [[Mountain Province]] (c. 1910).]]
The first step in the manufacture of pots is the acquisition of the starting material, clay. The clay is then pounded, added with enough amount of water, to reach the wanted flexibility, and placed in a rotating plate. Using the hand-modeling and coil-and-scrape techniques, the height, thickness and shape of the pot is established. After this, the rim is designed by placing a wet rag on top of it and then rotating it in the other direction. Furthermore, scraping of the walls can also be done if the walls produced are too thick.

The pot, after the modeling stage, is then dried for a short period of time before the base is shaped. Also, after additional heating, small amounts of clay are added inside and outside the clay to maintain the evenness of the surface. A polishing step can also be done through the use of a polishing stone. In some cases, pots are also painted with red hematite paint for some stylized design.

'''Pottery Functions'''	&lt;ref name="archaeo2"/&gt;

Pots are ceramic vessels that are made by molding clay into its wanted shape and then leaving it in an environment with an elevated temperature thereby making it solid and sturdy. It is widely recognized as one of better tools that humans invented since it managed to store the surplus of food Neolithic humans gathered.

In the book Pottery Function: A Use-Alteration Perspective, the author, [[James Skibo]], reasoned out why the use of pots is far more advantageous than baskets and other organic containers. He said that since potteries are commonly made in clay, heat has little to none effect on the container, and its contents, and that it protects the food from moisture and pests. Furthermore, its range of storable contents is far wider than baskets and animal skins since it can store both liquid and dry goods.

Also, Rice, in his book Pottery Analysis, classified ceramic vessels into 17 categories depending on various factors that concern the use and production of the tool. One of these is the content wherein he further divided a type of pot into four depending on the state (liquid or solid) and temperature (hot or cold) of the food inside it. He also said that a ceramic has three main uses. These three are storage, processing, and transfer.

Based from these three uses that Rice gave, Skibo further characterized the usage of ceramic vessels by dividing the tool’s function into two, (1) intended use and (2) actual use.

Intended use, as the name implies, is how the tool’s supposed to be used. This is the basis of the manufacture of the ceramic vessel since the form follows the function. On the other hand, actual use is how the tool was used. This sometimes disregards the pot’s form as long it can do a specific 
function.

'''Kalinga Pottery and its Uses''' &lt;ref name="archaeo2"/&gt;
[[File:Burnay (tapayan) jars - Philippines.JPG|thumb|right|Burnay (''tapayan'') jars used as lawn ornaments.]]
In Kalinga, ceramic vessels can be used for two situations: daily life use and ceremonial use. 
Daily life uses include the making of rice from the pots and the transfer of water from nearby water bodies to their homes.

• Determining actual function of Kalinga pots

As said, a pottery sometimes has a different actual use than intended use. This is the reason why when archaeologists study the function of a pottery, they tend to focus on how the tool was actually used. They do this by studying the alterations that the pottery has. These alterations, accretion and attrition, are commonly the abrasions and scratches on the vessel. In Skibo’s study of Kalinga potteries functions, he relied on three main tests, namely (1) dissolved residue, (2) surface attrition and (3) carbon deposition.	
# Dissolved residue – This test was done to determine the organic matters that were once placed in the vessel. Through the combination of a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrophotometer, the composition of the fatty acids inside the vessel was determined. Although a complete identification of the species of plant and animals was not possible, Skibo managed to know which pots were used for rice and vegetable/ meat cooking. 	
# Surface Attrition – Skibo’s study on the attrition of the pots showed how the pot was used. By looking at the trace attritions inside the vessel, the type, frequency, angle and direction of stirring for each pot was determined. Furthermore, Skibo also concluded that two pots can be differentiated from each other, on the basis of what type of food it cooks, from the abrasions. He said that rice pots will have a little amount of stirring while the vegetable/meat pots will have numerous marks.	
# Carbon Deposition – This test, as said by Skibo, can determine the type of food cooked, how it was cooked and how the pot was placed on the flame. From this, another distinction between rice and vegetable/meat pots was established.

{{cite book|last1=Solheim|first1=William|title=The archaeology of central Philippines: A study chiefly of the Iron Age and its relationships.|date=2002|publisher=Bureau of Print|location=Manila}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three major complexes in Philippine Iron Age according to Solheim, Kalanay, Novaliches and Bau pottery complexes. Kalanay pottery complex pertains to Beyer’s Early Iron Age pottery of the Visayan Islands found in Negros and Mindoro; novaliches pottery complex to Beyer’s Early Iron Age pottery from Rizal province. Bau pottery, on the other hand, does not fit into the two previous complexes and could correspond instead to the Late Iron Age pottery.

'''Kalanay Pottery Complex''' &lt;ref name="archaeo"/&gt;
[[File:Double ikat weaving from Sulu, Philippines, East-West Center.JPG|thumb|right|A double [[ikat]] weaving from [[Sulu]], made of banana leaf stalk fiber ([[Abacá]]).]]
The type site of the Kalanay pottery complex is the [[Kalanay Cave]] found in Masbate. From this site, the pottery is further subdivided into pottery types Kalanay and Bagupantao.

Specific varieties of decoration are as follows:

* Paired diagonals and borders, with variations including single diagonals or verticals and borders, or wavy lines and borders
* Curvilinear scrolls and triangles
* Rectangular scroll
* Triangles, with variations including alternating triangles and borders or running triangles
* Rectangles and diagonals
* Zoomorphs
* Punctate fieldwhere areas bonded by incised lines are emphasized by punctuations or dashes
* Diagonals without borders, including a band of horizontal V’s and alternating diagonals off a center line
* Impressed crenelations
* Impressed or carved scallop design
* Impressed tool
* Carved cutouts in ring stands

Kalanay complex pottery can be divided into 16 groups according to Solheim.

# Large jars with wide necks
# Large jars with narrow necks
# Small jars
# Deep bowls
# Shallow bowls
# Very shallow bowls
# Lids
# Shallow bowls with ring stands
# Tetrapods
# Jars with angle between side and bottom
# Spherical jars with small mouths, without angle at rim
# Angular Vessels

'''Bau Pottery Complex''' &lt;ref name="archaeo"/&gt;
[[File:Ifugao Fabrics.png|thumb|right|Fabric weaved from [[Ifugao]].]]
It has less variation in both form and decoration compared to the Kalanay pottery complex.

Specific varieties of decoration are as follows:

* Paddle Impressed
* Tool Impressed, including simple-tool and compound-tool impressed
* Stamp Impressed
* Applique ribbons of clay

In terms of forms:

* Small jars with everted rims
* Small jars without everted rim
* Small heavy jars with flat bottom
* Cups with ring feet
* Jars with ring feet

'''Novaliches Pottery Complex''' &lt;ref name="archaeo"/&gt;

Most of Novaliches pottery can be distinguished from Bau pottery and Kalanay pottery. While it shares form and decoration with Kalanay pottery, it contains more variability compared to Bau pottery. According to Solheim (2002), “it is the most sophisticated pottery that has yet been found in the Philippines”

Novaliches pottery can be diagnosed by its form being a shallow bowl with a high right-foot. The shallow bowl is generally plain but the feet are highly decorated. Majority of Novaliches pottery were well polished. The form is so symmetrical that it looks as if it was made in a potter wheel, however, examinations showed that it wasn’t.

Specific varieties of decoration are as follows:

* Cutouts
* Narrow vertical elements; carved, tool impressed, or running impressed lines
* Horizontal and diagonal elements, including simple tool impressions, compound tool impressions and carved elements
* Horizontal broadline impressed lines

Vessel forms are as follows:

* Shallow bowls with high ring stands
* Shallow bowls with low-ring stands
* Jars with low-ring stands
* Angle jars
* Jars with short necks and everted rims

'''Kalanay Cave Site''' &lt;ref name="archaeo"/&gt;

The Kalanay cave site is a small burial cave. It is located at the northwest coast of Masbate.

• Kalanay Pottery

* Kalanay Plain	
* Majority (80 per cent) of the excavated vessels.
* Variations in size and shape
* Technique used in the manufacture:  Paddle-and-anvil technique 
* Differences in the base of the vessels (some have rounded bottom while some use a ring foot or a tetrapod for support).
* Large observable differences in color that is associated with the inability of the potter to control the fire, causing the uneven distribution of the heat.
 
• Kalanay Incised

* Incised around the neck, rim of a jar or the outside of a bowl in a band of repeating elements
* Little care was given so the jars appear poorly made despite its well thought out designs. This can be attributed to the possibility that the certain tradition of this pot was no longer significant to the manufacturer
* Kalanay-Impressed: simple tool and simple and compound tool
* Simple tool impressing found around the jar or bowl with a flange

• Kalanay slipped

* Forms: jars, large with wide mouth and everted rim, or small with everted rim; bowls, deep with inslanting sides, or very shallow which turned out lip
* Some were polished, some were not.

'''Bagupantao Pottery''' &lt;ref name="archaeo"/&gt;
 
• Bagupantao Plain

* Majority of the pots’ paste is red-brown in color, with gray or black as the minority. Its texture ranges from fine to medium and its thickness is usually 5–8&amp;nbsp;mm in length. The common forms of the pots are jars with wide to narrow mouths and its normally large (a body diameter of 24 to 35&amp;nbsp;cm). 
* Difference between Kalanay Plain: Evenness of color and cleanness of clay
 
• Bagupantao Impressed 
 
* The type of paste is the same as Bagupantao plain, red-brown in color.  It is also highly decorated on its rim with circles, punctuations and crenellations. 
* Larger (28 –31&amp;nbsp;cm body diameter) and thicker (9-14 thickness) than Bagupantao plain.

• Bagupantao Painted
 
* The paste used is the same as Bagupantao impressed and plain but it is covered with heavy red hematite slip inside and outside of the neck.
* Thinner (2–7&amp;nbsp;mm) and smaller than Bagupantao plain.

• Extraneous Pottery - Three vessels that did not belong to the Bagupantao and Kalanay style were also found.

First pot

* Similar clay used as the Bagupantao and Kalanay vessels. The color, red-brown, was also the same, inside and out.
* Ornamented with small crystals on the paste and black flakes on the surface.
* As thin (3–8&amp;nbsp;mm) as the Bagupantao painted vessel.

Second pot

* Same size and structure as the Bagupantao pots.
* Used a different paste (fibrous texture and contained mineral inclusions)
* Heavily polished and the surface color ranges from red-brown to light gray.
* As thick as the Bagupantao plain jars (5–12&amp;nbsp;mm).

Third pot

* The paste used is chocolate-brown in color and its texture is fine.
* It is very thick (15–20&amp;nbsp;mm) when compared to the other pots.
* Poorly made because of the uneven distribution of heat to the pot (pieces break longitudinally).

==Culinary art==
{{main|Filipino cuisine}}
[[File:Halo halo1.jpg|thumb|left|A bowl of [[Halo-halo]].]]
Filipino cuisine is composed of the cuisines of 144 distinct ethnolinguistic groups found within the Philippine archipelago. The majority of mainstream Filipino dishes that compose Filipino cuisine are from the cuisines of the Bikol, Chavacano, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, [[Kapampangan cuisine|Kapampangan]], Maranao, Pangasinan, Cebuano (or ''Bisaya''), Tagalog, and Waray ethnolinguistic tribes. The style of cooking and the food associated with it have evolved over many centuries from their [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] origins to a mixed cuisine of [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]], and [[American cuisine|American]] influences, in line with the major waves of influence that had enriched the cultures of the archipelago, as well as others adapted to indigenous ingredients and the local palate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Philippine cookbook |last=Alejandro |first=Reynaldo |year=1985 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-399-51144-8 |pages=12–14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUaDoUF0tRwC&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=%22Philippine%20Cuisine%22%20influences&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Philippine%20Cuisine%22%20influences&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book |title=Cuisine and Culture: A History of cavalo and People |last=Civitello |first=Linda |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location= |isbn=978-1-118-09875-2 |page=263 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwtE4v_qS4EC&amp;lpg=PT263&amp;dq=%22Philippine%20Cuisine%22%20influences&amp;pg=PT263#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 June 2011 |quote=Just as Filipino people are part Malay, Chinese and Spanish, so is the cuisine of their seven-thousand-island nation}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book |title=Philippines Country Study Guide |year=2007 |publisher=Int'l Business Publications |location= |isbn=978-1-4330-3970-6 |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J8VkaWS6xiMC&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=%22Philippine%20Cuisine%22%20influences&amp;pg=PA111#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Philippine%20Cuisine%22%20influences&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 June 2011 |quote=Throughout the centuries, the islands have incorporated the cuisine of the early Malay settlers, Arab and Chinese traders, and Spanish and American colonizers along with other Oriental and Occidental accent and flavors.}}&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.balitapinoy.net/philippine_cuisine.html "Philippine Cuisine."] [http://www.balitapinoy.net Balitapinoy.net].

==Other art forms==

She has passed on the ''batek'' art to at least three of her apprentices who she trained for 8 years, thus preserving the last living tattoo tradition of the Philippines.]]
* The term '''indigenous art''' is sometimes used to refer to the utility of indigenous materials as a medium for the creation of different kinds of artworks, as with the paintings by [[Elito Circa]], a famous folk artist of Pantabangan and a pioneer in using indigenous materials as well as natural raw materials including human blood.&lt;ref name="PhilStar"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/breaking-news/705010/artist-uses-own-blood-hair-paintings|accessdate=2011-07-12|title=Artist uses own blood, hair in paintings|work=The Philippine Star|publisher=Philippine Star|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Filipino painters and foreign artists were influenced by Filipino indigenous art and started using these indigenous materials, which include extracts from onion, tomato, ''tuba'' (palm wine), coffee, rust, molasses and other materials available anywhere to be used as paint.
* '''Jewelry design'''. In 2015/16, the Asia Society in New York presented an exhibit called ''Philippine Gold: Treasures of Forgotten Kingdoms.''   The exhibition presents spectacular works of gold primarily discovered over the past forty years on the Philippine islands of Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. The regalia, jewelry, ceremonial weapons, and ritualistic and funerary objects attest to the recently uncovered evidence of prosperity and achievement of Philippine polities that flourished between the tenth and thirteenth centuries, long before the Spanish discovered and colonized the region. Although the forms and styles of the majority of these works developed locally, some indicate that Philippine craftsmen had been exposed to objects from beyond their borders through the robust cultural connections and maritime trade in Southeast Asia during what was an early Asian economic boom.
* '''Kut-kut''' is a painting technique combining ancient Oriental and European art process. Considered lost art and highly collectible art form. Very few known art pieces existed today. The technique was practiced by the indigenous people of Samar Island between early 1600 and late 1800 AD. Kut-kut is an exotic Philippine art form based on early century techniques—sgraffito, encaustic and layering. The merging of these ancient styles produces a unique artwork characterized by delicate swirling interwoven lines, multi-layered texture and an illusion of three-dimensional space.
* The '''[[tanaga]]''' is a type of Filipino poetry.
* The '''batek''' or '''batok''' is a form of indigenous tattooing of the Kalinga people in the Cordilleras. The most prominent tattoo artist in the country is [[Whang-od]], who has been known as the last mambabatok until has started mentoring her niece on the art so that the tattoo artistry of the Kalinga will continue. The art form has been critically acclaimed internationally in the United States, Germany, France, Canada, and many others.

== Filipino art housed outside the Philippines ==
Various artifacts and art pieces have either been looted or directly bought from the Philippines by various foreign entities since the Spanish colonial period. The majority of stolen or bought Philippine artifacts and art pieces were shipped into foreign hands during the American period, World War II, and post-war era, where the economy was crippled. During the post-war era, Philippine artifacts and art pieces became easy pickings for foreigners as Filipinos were forced to sell the items in extremely low prices because of the immediate need for money during an era marred with high inflation and high cost of living. These pieces include the [[Golden Tara]] (in United States possession), the [[Balangiga bells]] (in United States possession), the two remaining copies of ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'' (in United States and Spain's possession), the [[Boxer Codex]] (in United States possession), and many others. Most pieces are currently under the possession of the [[United States]] and [[Spain]]. Various attempts to return stolen or looted Philippine artifacts and art pieces have been made by the Philippine government since the 1990s. The most recent is the national call to return the Balangiga bells in 2017 and the Golden Tara in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/3253243/Stolen-artefacts-point-to-lost-Philippines-tribe.html|title=Stolen artefacts point to lost Philippines tribe|first=Thomas Bell, South East Asia|last=Correspondent|date=24 October 2008|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/160345/artifacts-looted-from-shipwreck|title=Artifacts looted from shipwreck|first=Nestor P.

== Notable Filipino artists ==
Past notable Filipino artists include [[Juan Luna]], [[Fernando Amorsolo]], [[Augusto Arbizo]], [[Félix Resurrección Hidalgo|Félix Hidalgo]], [[Ang Kiukok]], [[Anita Magsaysay-Ho]], [[Lito Mayo]], [[Mauro Malang Santos]], Santiago Bosé, [[Rey Paz Contreras]] and [[David Medalla|David Cortés Medalla]]. Present-day Filipino artists featuring Filipino culture include [[Benedicto Cabrera]], [[Elito Circa]], Fred DeAsis, Daniel Coquilla, Francisco Viri, and Nunelucio Alvarado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kulay-diwa.com/home |title=Kulay-Diwa Gallery of Philippine Contemporary Art - Gallery of Philippine Contemporary Art |publisher=Kulay-diwa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The art or paintings by Zóbel, Amorsolo and many more could be seen in most of the art museums in the Philippines. Zobel's paintings can be seen in the Ayala Museum.

[[Art theft]] and [[looted art|looting]] occurred on a massive scale during [[World War II]]. It originated with the policies of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] countries, primarily [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Japan]], which systematically looted occupied territories. Near the end of the war the [[Soviet Union]], in turn, began looting reclaimed and occupied territories. "The grand scale of looted artwork by the Nazis has resulted in the loss of many pieces being scattered across the world." (Minyard, 2007)

Although the looting of "cultural heritage" of the German people and private collectors was not permitted in the 1945 agreement of Yalta, following the defeat of Germany by the Allied forces the following goods disappeared: three truckloads of precious art, which was listed in a confiscated list by the US forces (in the mine Merker in Thuringia), and one trainload of 20 wagons loaded with artwork and jewels from Hungary (named the "gold train").{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} According to a 2001 ''Der Spiegel'' article,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} the artwork is suspected to be in the US and has never been officially declared. The lost artworks from the "Grube Merker," about 450 pictures, are not found in any museum and thought to have been sold privately.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

An attempt by the US to confiscate more German art by requesting 202 precious pictures to be taken was prevented by [[Walter Farmer]] on 6 November 1945, an art protection officer in Wiesbaden leading the central art collection store.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Although against his direct orders from the US, he assembled 24 colleagues from Germany and Austria and successfully prevented the removal of the pictures (named as operation "Westward Ho").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-19438032.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Before his death in 1997, Farmer was awarded Germany's highest civilian honor, the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit, for his work in returning the 202 paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: Walter Farmer. The Economist; London Vol. 344, Iss. 8031, Anonymous (Aug 23, 1997): 67.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the book ''Art as Politics in the Third Reich'' by [[Jonathan Petropoulos|Jonathan Petropoulus]] he outlines how there is a need for further cooperation by smaller art galleries to recover art that they may be holding and not know who it belongs to. He says that there are still many tens of thousands of pieces of art missing today, but there is still more research to be done to get a more accurate number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art as Politics in the Third Reich|last=Petropoulos|first=Jonathan|publisher=Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large plan was drafted by the Nazis for much of the stolen art to be featured in a so-called [[Fuhrermuseum|Führermuseum]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114537/http://www.artrestitution.at/F.prerogative.html "The Führer’s prerogative and the planned Führer Museum in Linz"] Art Database of the National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism &lt;/ref&gt; which would display much of the art plundered by the Nazis. This museum would feature works that were not considered to be "[[degenerate art]]" and would instead solely focus on the aesthetics that Hitler considered to be "good", and was to be created in the city of [[Linz]]. However, this museum was never created, and much of the art that may have been on display there is still missing today.  The Nazis were so vehemently against the loss of the art that they had plundered for this museum that there was a plan to destroy a stockpile of art saved for the Führermuseum at the [[Altaussee]] salt mines, which held over 12000 pieces of stolen art, using eight 500-kilogram bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Edsel |first1=Robert M. |title=The Monuments Men |date=20 August 2009 |publisher=Hachette/Center Street |isbn=978-1-59995-149-2 |pages=303-306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countless pieces of art were stolen during the Holocaust and many were destroyed.  The Nazis were relentless in their efforts to get rid of the Jewish people and their culture. Paintings that had been passed down from generation to generation were taken and destroyed. This was extremely emotionally hard for many Jewish families because it was not only an attack on their families and culture, but also on their history. There have barely been any efforts of restitution. Many of the families who lost art are simply now left with claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Willi|first1=Korte|title=Nazi Looted Art: The Case of the Missing Perspective|journal=First Person Singular|date=September 1, 2006|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the primary problems encountered by individuals pursuing claims is that it is difficult to locate the necessary documentation on provenance. Organizations with information on a piece's history, museums in particular, often have a disincentive to share information that could assist in an heir's claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foulkes|first=Lucia|date=2015|title=The art of atonement: how mandated transparency can help return masterpieces lost during World War II|url=|journal=Boston College International and Comparative Law Review|volume=38|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=Research Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Big Mama''''' is a 2000 short [[documentary film]] by American [[Tracy Seretean]]. It chronicles the struggle of 89-year-old Viola Dees (1909-2000) and her fight to retain custody of her grandson. It illustrates many of the difficulties facing an increasing number of the grandparents who are raising their grandchildren in the United States today, because of family crises related to drugs and prison. It was shown on HBO and won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)|Best Documentary Short Subject]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/241013/Big-Mama/details |title=NY Times: Big Mama |accessdate=2008-12-06|work=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big Mama was edited at HBO by Geof Bartz, A.C.E.

==Plot==
The film follows 18 months in the life of Viola Dees (89 years old) as she tries to persuade Los Angeles authorities that she can care for her grandson, 9-year-old Walter. Born to a drug-addicted mother, Walter was put into foster care. Dees gained his release to her care when he was age four. By then he was very disturbed, traumatized by the early death of his father and the disappearance of his mother. But he appeared bright and sweetly loving to his grandmother.

The film focuses on the continuous battle against age discrimination faced by Dees and many like her. While contending with her own declining health, and a bureaucratic and legal system that continually threatened to separate her from her grandson, Dees fights the misconception that age supersedes one's ability to love and care for a child.

The film follows the family as they deal with several blows. Dees suffers a heart attack, provoking hostile and disturbed behavior from Walter. He burned a magazine in his bedroom, which resulted in a house fire, destroying their home. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where the doctors determined that Dees was no longer able to handle her grandson. They would not release him to her until she agreed to place him in long-term residential care. After a challenging search, Walter is accepted at an appropriate facility and thrives during his year there. However, when treatment was completed, social workers determined that Dees was too frail to care for him, and Walter was placed again in a foster home. Walter's aunts and uncles were unable to take him in, possibly because they felt unqualified to deal with his often threatening and troubled behavior.

'''Cerro de los Santos''' is an [[Iberian culture|Iberian]] religious [[sanctuary]] built in the 4th century BCE, during the Iberian period, with evidence of continued use into the Roman period.  The site lies in southeastern Spain near an ancient road. Little remains of the original structures at the site. Nineteenth century excavations documented some features of a temple but only an outline now remains. The site is known for its many votive sculptures, numbering about 300. Most of the sculptures depict women including the most notable find, the [[Dama del Cerro de los Santos]]. In addition to the women, statues of men, possibly dating from a later period, and a few statues of animals have also been found.

== Location ==
The site is located outside of the municipality of [[Montealegre del Castillo]] in the province of [[Albacete]], Spain. The site, marked by a commemorative obelisk erected in 1929, is near the highway to [[Yecla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.contestania.com/cerrosantos.html|title=Cerro de los Santos|website=www.contestania.com|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/37001.html|title=Cerro de los Santos, Montealegre del Castillo – Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire|website=dare.ht.lu.se|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site would have been along the [[Via Heraclea]], in the territory of the [[Bastetani]] near the [[Contestani]]. The site is a few kilometres from another Iberian site, [[Llano de la Consolación]]. Few visible remains survive. The outline of the temple, visible in the eighteenth century, has disappeared completely.

== Temple ==
The temple was {{convert|15.6|by|9.9|m|abbr=on}} and had a {{convert|2.6|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} wide doorway with access by two flights of steps. Based on the 19th century excavations, the walls were formed by a double course of square blocks secured by lead clamps. The roof was tiled and the floor may have been paved with rhomboidal terracotta tiles. The site does not have the usual characteristics of an Iberian sanctuary.{{sfn|Balil|1976}}

== Sculptures ==
Excavations uncovered about 300 stone sculptures. Most of the sculptures are [[votives]] of human figures, although a few animal sculptures have been found. Sculptures of women dominate.{{sfn|Balil|1976}} The sculptures are individual pieces with only one example of a group sculpture being found. The sculptures accumulated over time with the earliest being dated to the 4th century BCE while later examples have Latin letter inscriptions or appear more Roman in style. A lack of artifacts from the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman period]] suggests that the site stopped being used.{{sfn|Balil|1976}} The sculptures are generally similar in hair and dress, but the eyes differ in size and position. Jaeggi believes this may be an attempt to differentiate otherwise similar statues to better represent unique donors.{{sfn|Jaeggi|2008|p=30}}  According to Jaeggi, the votive statues represent their donors who receive protection from the a deity when their avatars are permanently placed in the sanctuary.{{sfn|Jaeggi|2008|p=28}}The sculptures are now primarily housed at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]] in [[Madrid]].{{sfn|Balil|1976}}
[[File:Dama oferente del Cerro de los Santos (16119971754).jpg|thumb|upright|Dama of Cerro de los Santos]]
The female statues have cloaks or tiara-like headdresses. Most of these figures are standing, but some depict the figure seated on a chair or throne. Folds in cloth tend to be depicted with stylized zig-zag lines.{{sfn|Balil|1976}} The best known of the statues is the Dama del Cerro de los Santos. The statue stands 1&amp;nbsp;m and 40&amp;nbsp;cm tall, holding an offering cup. She is dated to the 3rd or 2nd century BCE, but has a very stylized form reminiscent of earlier [[Iberian sculpture]]. According to Jaeggi, the sculpture does not show Italic or Greek influence.{{sfn|Jaeggi|2008|p=29}} The male statues tend to be similar with all wearing the same dress, a [[pallium]] held in the right hand. A few have earrings or pendant [[Bulla (amulet)|bullae]]. There is only one sculpture, holding a short sword, identified as a warrior.{{sfn|Balil|1976}}  There are no complete male statues preserved.{{sfn|Jaeggi|2008|p=29}} Hair on the male figures is depicted as a compact mass with curls depicted with notched lines.{{sfn|Jaeggi|2008|p=29}}

Truszkowski argues that the female sculptures date primarily to the period prior to the [[Punic Wars]] and that the shift to male statues, with more Hellenistic styling, occurred during the conflicts.{{sfn|Truszkowski|2006}}

'''''Divorce Iranian Style''''' is a 1998 documentary film directed by [[Kim Longinotto]] and [[Ziba Mir-Hosseini]] which chronicles the legal battles of three Iranian couples as they seek divorce in the [[Judicial system of Iran|Iranian court system]]. The film documents three couples as they go through the various legal processes and cultural barriers as they seek to file for [[Divorce in Islam|divorce]] and highlights the poignant differences of men and women in the court system. The film also shows the complexity of blending religious law with a state run court system.

== Gender differences ==
One of the key elements this film documents is the dichotomy between men and women in the eyes of the [[Iran]]ian court. From the start of the film this becomes clear as the documentary shows the two entrances for men and women as they enter the courthouse. As the men enter they are searched for weapons and cell phones, and as the women enter they are examined to ensure they are dressed according to [[Islam and clothing|Islamic standards]] and guidelines. As the men and women stand before the judge and argue their case the differences between the men and women become even more readily apparent. While the women often plead their cases vigorously, alleging everything from infidelity to domestic abuse, they are almost constantly reminded that divorce is greatly frowned upon by [[Islam]], and if they would try harder at home (i.e. wear makeup around the house, make themselves more attractive, show more respect for their husbands) many of the allegations would resolve themselves.

As the documentary progresses, the filmmakers note the differences in [[Women's rights in Iran|legal rights]] Islamic men and women have when asking for a divorce. In most cases, only men are allowed to seek a divorce unless other circumstances exist such as the man not being able to provide the woman with a child. As more of the rights of men and women are explained the discrepancies become more clear. For instance, should a man seek to divorce his wife he is liable to nothing more other than paying court sanctioned compensation to his wife. However, should the woman seek the divorce she likely will forfeit much if not all of her "marriage gift" (monetary compensation) and will likely deal with the cultural shame and stigma of being divorced. Furthermore, the film address the issue of child custody and once again highlights the differences between men and women. Should the divorce be finalized and the woman remarries, she automatically forfeits custody of her children and they are returned to her husband. Over and over again, the film seems to show how the law and the court system are established in such a way to favor the rights of men over women.

== Blending religious and state law ==
Beyond highlighting the differences in the rights of men and women in the court, the film also shows the complexities which occur as the Iranian state attempts to blend [[Sharia]] law and secular state law. Time and again the Muslim [[Qadi]] presiding over the cases will remind those before him of how Islam detests divorce and encourages them to reconcile. Even beyond his religious council, the documentary also shows the Qadi's willingness to impose Islamic punishment such as reminding one man he can receive 70 [[Flagellation|lashes]] for referring to his wife as a "loose woman" in public, but also reminds the wife she must provide four witnesses before such a punishment can be handed down.

However, even while it is clear that Islamic law is used and imposed it the film also shows how the Iranian court is willing to combine secular state law as well. This is especially true in terms of the court issuing orders for medical tests to be performed to determine if facts presented in a case are true before rendering a verdict. It also clear that along with the religious elements which are in place, the Iranian court has a well established state run [[bureaucracy]] within the court. There are clear procedures in place and a litany of papers which must be filed with the correct departments with the proper signatures included.

It is this blending of religious and state law which allows for the judges to have a great deal of leeway in making rulings and issuing mandates to those coming before the court. Often, before issuing any ruling or allowing the divorce to take place, the Qadi attempts to resolve the issue through [[arbitration]] and then decides himself if the arbitration was effective and if the couple should be able to reconcile.

==Legacy==
The title of the 2005 documentary ''[[Nose, Iranian Style]]'' is a homage to ''Divorce, Iranian Style''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=A. Jafar |author2= E. Casanova |title=Global Beauty, Local Bodies |location= |publisher=Springer |date=10 December 2013 |isbn=113736534X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh spent the last few months of his life in Auvers-sur-Oise, a small town just north of Paris, after he left an asylum at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]] in May 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Van Gogh: The Life|year=2011|publisher=[[Random House]]|first1=Steven|last1=Naifeh|first2=Gregory|last2= White Smith|isbn=0-375-50748-5|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/book/119583/van-gogh-by-steven-naifeh-and-gregory-white-smith|page=822 ''ff.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after arriving at Auvers, Van Gogh wrote his sister [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]]: "Here there are roofs of mossy thatch which are superb, and of which I’ll certainly do something."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Willemien van Gogh.

The '''Federal Theatre Project''' ('''FTP'''; 1935–39) was a [[New Deal]] program to fund [[theatre]] and other live artistic performances and entertainment programs in the [[United States]] during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. It was one of five [[Federal Project Number One]] projects sponsored by the [[Works Progress Administration]]. It was created not as a cultural activity but as a relief measure to employ artists, writers, directors and theater workers. It was shaped by national director [[Hallie Flanagan]] into a federation of regional theatres that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation in new forms and techniques, and made it possible for millions of Americans to see live theatre for the first time. The Federal Theatre Project ended when its funding was canceled after strong Congressional objections to the left-wing political tone of a small percentage of its productions.

Part of the Works Progress Administration, the Federal Theatre Project was a New Deal program established August 27, 1935,&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|29}} funded under the [[Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935]]. Of the [[United States Dollar|$]]4.88 billion allocated to the WPA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=14926 |title=Letter on Allocation of Work Relief Funds |last=Roosevelt |first=Franklin D.  |authorlink=Franklin Delano Roosevelt |date=August 26, 1935 |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley |access-date=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; $27 million was approved for the employment of [[Federal Art Project|artists]], [[Federal Music Project|musicians]], [[Federal Writers' Project|writers]] and actors under the WPA's [[Federal Project Number One]].&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|44}}

Government relief efforts through the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] and [[Civil Works Administration]] in the two preceding years were amateur experiments regarded as charity, not a theatre program. The Federal Theatre Project was a new approach to unemployment in the theatre profession. Only those certified as employable could be offered work, and that work was to be within the individual's defined skills and trades.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|15–16}}

"For the first time in the relief experiments of this country the preservation of the skill of the worker, and hence the preservation of his self-respect, became important," wrote [[Hallie Flanagan]], director of the Federal Theatre Project.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|17}} A theater professor at [[Vassar College]] who had studied the operation of government-sponsored theatre abroad for the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]],&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|9}} Flanagan was chosen to head the Federal Theatre Project by WPA head [[Harry Hopkins]],&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|20}} a former classmate at Grinnell College.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|7}} Roosevelt and Hopkins selected her despite considerable pressure to choose someone from the commercial theatre; they believed the project should be led by someone with academic credentials and a national perspective.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;{{Rp|39}}

Flanagan was given the daunting task of building a nationwide theater program to employ thousands of unemployed artists in as little time as possible. The problems of the theatre preceded the financial collapse of 1929. By that time it was already threatened with extinction due to the growing popularity of films and radio, but the commercial theatre was reluctant to adapt its practices.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;{{Rp|38}} Many actors, technicians and stagehands had suffered since [[1914 in film|1914]], when movies began to replace [[Repertory theatre|stock]], [[vaudeville]] and other live stage performances nationwide. [[Sound film#Triumph of the "talkies"|Sound motion pictures]] displaced 30,000 musicians. In the [[Great Depression]], people who had no money for entertainment found an entire evening of entertainment at the movies for 25 cents, while commercial theatre charged $1.10 to $2.20 admission to cover the cost of theater rental, advertising and fees to performers and union technicians. Unemployed directors, actors, designers, musicians and stagecrew took any kind of work they were able to find, whatever it paid, and charity was often their only recourse.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|13–14}}

"This is a tough job we're asking you to do," Hopkins told Flanagan at their first meeting in May 1935. "I don't know why I still hang on to the idea that unemployed actors get just as hungry as anybody else."&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|7–9}}

Hopkins promised "a free, adult, uncensored theatre"&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|28}} — something Flanagan spent the next four years trying to build.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|29}} She emphasized the development of local and regional theatre, "to lay the foundation for the development of a truly creative theatre in the United States with outstanding producing centers in each of those regions which have common interests as a result of geography, language origins, history, tradition, custom, occupations of the people."&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|22–23}}

==Operation==
On October 24, 1935, Flanagan prefaced her instructions on the Federal Theatre's operation with a statement of purpose:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The primary aim of the Federal Theatre Project is the reemployment of theatre workers now on public relief rolls: actors, directors, playwrights, designers, vaudeville artists, stage technicians, and other workers in the theatre field. The far reaching purpose is the establishment of theatres so vital to community life that they will continue to function after the program of this Federal Project is completed.&lt;ref name="Instructions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=ftscript&amp;fileName=farbf/00010002/ftscript.db&amp;recNum=2 |title=Instructions for Federal Theatre Projects of the Works Progress Administration |last=Flanagan |first=Hallie |date=October 24, 1935 |website=New Deal Stage |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within a year the Federal Theatre Project employed 15,000 men and women,&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"/&gt;{{Rp|174}} paying them $23.86 a week.&lt;ref name="NYT New Deal doc"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dunning |first=Jennifer  |authorlink=Jennifer Dunning |date=July 5, 1981 |title='New Deal' Artists Star in a TV Documentary |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/05/arts/new-deal-artists-star-in-a-tv-documentary.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location= |access-date=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its nearly four years of existence it played to 30 million people in more than 200 theaters nationwide&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"&gt;{{cite book |last=Houseman |first=John |authorlink=John Houseman |title=Run-Through: A Memoir |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |date=1972 |isbn=0-671-21034-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|174}} — renting many that had been shuttered — as well as parks, schools, churches, clubs, factories, hospitals and closed-off streets.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;{{Rp|40}} Its productions totalled approximately 1,200, not including its radio programs.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|432}} Because the Federal Theatre was created to employ and train people, not to generate revenue, no provision was made for the receipt of money when the project began. At its conclusion, 65 percent of its productions were still presented free of charge.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|434}} The total cost of the Federal Theatre Project was $46 million.&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=Ronald|date=January 1974|title=The Role of Blacks in the Federal Theatre, 1935–1939|url=|journal=The Journal of Negro History|publisher=|volume=59|issue=1|pages=38–50|jstor=2717139}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|40}}

"In any consideration of the cost of the Federal Theatre," Flanagan wrote, "it should be borne in mind that the funds were allotted, according to the terms of the Relief Act of 1935, to pay wages to unemployed people. Therefore, when Federal Theatre was criticized for spending money, it was criticized for doing what it was set up to do."&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|34–35}}

The Federal Theatre Project established five regional centers in [[New York, New York]], [[Boston]] (Northeast), [[Chicago]] (Midwest), [[Los Angeles]] (West), and [[New Orleans]] (South).&lt;ref&gt;[https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/6858/umi-umd-4347.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y UMD ]- Retrieved 2018-05-02&lt;/ref&gt; The FTP did not operate in every state, since many lacked a sufficient number of unemployed people in the theatre profession.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|434}} The project in Alabama was closed in January 1937 when its personnel were transferred to a new unit in Georgia. Only one event was presented in Arkansas. Units created in Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin were closed in 1936; projects in Indiana, Nebraska, Rhode Island and Texas were discontinued in 1937; and the Iowa project was closed in 1938.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|434–436}}

Many of the notable artists of the time participated in the Federal Theatre Project, including [[Susan Glaspell]] who served as Midwest bureau director.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|266}} The legacy of the Federal Theatre Project can also be found in beginning the careers of a new generation of theater artists. [[Arthur Miller]], [[Orson Welles]], [[John Houseman]], [[Martin Ritt]], [[Elia Kazan]], [[Joseph Losey]], [[Marc Blitzstein]] and [[Abe Feder]] are among those who became established, in part, through their work in the Federal Theatre.  Blitzstein, Houseman, Welles and Feder collaborated on the controversial production, ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]''.

The Federal Theatre Project was the most costly of the Federal One projects, consuming 29.1 percent of Federal One's budget, which was itself less than three-fourths of one percent of the total WPA budget.

On June 30, 1939, the Federal Theatre Project ended when its funding was canceled, largely due to strong Congressional objections to the overtly left-wing political tones of less than 10 percent of the Federal Theatre Project productions.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|361–363}}

==Living Newspaper==
{{main|Living Newspaper}}
[[Living Newspaper]]s were plays written by teams of researchers-turned-playwrights. These men and women clipped articles from newspapers about current events, often hot button issues like [[farm]] policy, [[syphilis]] testing, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], and housing inequity. These newspaper clippings were adapted into plays intended to inform audiences, often with [[progressivism|progressive]] or left-wing themes. ''Triple-A Plowed Under'', for instance, attacked the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] for killing an aid agency for farmers.  These politically themed plays quickly drew criticism from members of [[United States Congress|Congress]].

Although the undisguised political invective in the Living Newspapers sparked controversy, they also proved popular with audiences.  As an art form, the Living Newspaper is perhaps the Federal Theatre's most well-known work.

Problems with the Federal Theatre Project and Congress intensified when the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] objected to the first Living Newspaper, ''Ethiopia'', about [[Haile Selassie]] and his nation's struggles against [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invading Italian forces]]. The U.S. government soon mandated that the Federal Theatre Project, a government agency, could not depict foreign heads of state on the stage for fear of diplomatic backlash. Playwright and director [[Elmer Rice]], head of the New York office of the FTP, resigned in protest and was succeeded by his assistant, Philip W. Barber.

The Negro Theatre Unit was part of the Federal Theatre Project and had units that were set up in cities throughout the United States. The units were located in four different geographical regions of the country. In the West, units were located in Seattle, Washington, and Los Angeles, California. In the East, units were located in New York City, New York, Boston, Massachusetts, Hartford, Connecticut, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Newark, New Jersey. In the South, there were units in Raleigh, North Carolina, Durham, North Carolina, and Birmingham, Alabama. In the Midwest, units were located in Chicago, Illinois, Peoria, Illinois, and Cleveland, Ohio. The project provided employment and apprenticeships to black playwrights, directors, actors, and technicians. The project offered a much needed source of assistance for African-American theatre from 1935 to 1939. The project's inspiring purposes further influenced the founding within a year of the [[American Negro Theater]], 1940 – 1949.

The Negro Theatre Unit of New York City was the best known. It was headquartered at the [[Lafayette Theatre (Harlem)|Lafayette Theatre]] in Harlem, where some 30 plays were presented. The first was [[Frank H. Wilson]]'s folk drama, ''Walk Together Chillun'' (1936), about the deportation of 100 African-Americans from the South to the North to work for low wages. The second was ''Conjur' Man Dies'' (1936), a comedy-mystery adapted by [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Countee Cullen]] from [[Rudolph Fisher]]'s novel. The most popular production was the third, which came to be called the ''[[Voodoo Macbeth]]'' (1936), director [[Orson Welles]]'s adaptation of Shakespeare's play set on a mythical island suggesting the Haitian court of King [[Henri Christophe]].&lt;ref name="A to Z"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill |first=Anthony D.  |date=2009 |title=The A to Z of African American Theater|url= |location=Lanham |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishing Group |isbn=9780810870611}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|179–180}}

==Radio==
The Federal Theatre of the Air began weekly broadcasts March 15, 1936. For three years the radio division of the Federal Theatre Project presented an average of 3,000 programs annually on commercial stations and the NBC, Mutual and CBS networks. The major programs originated in New York; radio divisions were also created in 11 states.&lt;ref name="Arena"&gt;{{cite book |last=Flanagan |first=Hallie  |authorlink=Hallie Flanagan |date=1965 |title=Arena: The History of the Federal Theatre |url= |location=New York |publisher=Benjamin Blom, reprint edition [1940] |oclc=855945294}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|267–268, 397}}

Series included ''Professional Parade'', hosted by [[Fred Niblo]]; ''Experiments in Symphonic Drama'', original stories written for classical music; ''Gilbert and Sullivan Light Opera'', the complete works performed by Federal Theatre actors and recordings by [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|D'Oyly Carte]]; ''Ibsen's Plays'', performances of 12 major plays; ''Repertory Theatre of the Air'', presenting literary classics; ''Contemporary Theatre'', presenting plays by modern authors; and the interview program, ''Exploring the Arts and Sciences''.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|268}}

The radio division presented a wide range of programs on health and safety, art, music and history. The American Legion sponsored [[James Truslow Adams]]'s ''Epic of America''. The children's program, ''Once Upon a Time'', and [[Paul de Kruif]]'s ''Men Against Death'' were both honored by the National Committee for Education by Radio. In March 1939, at the invitation of the BBC, Flanagan broadcast the story of the Federal Theatre Project to Britain. Asked to expand the program to encompass the entire WPA, the radio division produced ''No Help Wanted'', a dramatization by [[William N. Robson]] with music by [[Leith Stevens]]. ''[[The Times]]'' called it "the best broadcast ever sent us from the Americas".&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|268–269}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radiogoldindex.com/cgi-local/p2.cgi?ProgramName=No%20Help%20Wanted |title=No Help Wanted  |publisher=RadioGOLDINdex |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions criticized by Congress==
A total of 81 of the Federal Theatre Project's 830 major titles were criticized by members of Congress for their content in public statements, committee hearings, on the floor of the Senate or House, or in testimony before Congressional committees. Only 29 were original productions of the Federal Theatre Project. The others included 32 revivals or stock productions; seven plays that were initiated by community groups; five that were never produced by the project; two works of Americana; two classics; one children's play; one Italian translation; and one Yiddish play.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|432–433}}

The Living Newspapers that drew criticism were ''Injunction Granted'', a history of American labor relations; ''[[One-Third of a Nation]]'', about housing conditions in New York; ''Power'',&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}} about energy from the consumer's point of view;&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|184–185}} and ''Triple A Plowed Under'', on farming problems in America.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}} Another that was criticized, on the history of medicine, was not completed.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|434}}

Dramas criticized by Congress were ''American Holiday'', about a small-town murder trial; ''Around the Corner'', a Depression-era comedy; ''Chalk Dust'', about an urban high school; ''Class of '29'', the Depression years as seen through young college graduates; ''Created Equal'', a review of American life since colonial times; ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]'s parable of democracy and dictatorship; ''No More Peace'', [[Ernst Toller]]'s satire on dictatorships; ''Professor Mamlock'', about Nazi persecution of Jews; ''Prologue to Glory'', about the early life of Abraham Lincoln; ''The Sun and I'', about [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]] in Egypt; and ''Woman of Destiny'', about a female President who works for peace.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

Negro Theatre Unit productions that drew criticism were ''The Case of Philip Lawrence'', a portrait of life in Harlem; ''Did Adam Sin?'', a review of black folklore with music; and ''Haiti'', a play about [[Toussaint Louverture]].&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

Also criticized for their content were the dance dramas ''Candide'', from Voltaire; ''How Long Brethren'', featuring songs by future [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] recipient [[Lawrence Gellert]]; and ''Trojan Incident'', a translation of Euripides with a prologue from Homer.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

''Help Yourself'', a satire on high-pressure business tactics, was among the comedies criticized by Congress. Others were ''Machine Age'', about mass production; ''On the Rocks'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]]; and ''The Tailor Becomes a Storekeeper''.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

Children's plays singled out were ''Mother Goose Goes to Town'', and ''[[Revolt of the Beavers]]'', which the ''[[New York Journal-American|New York American]]'' called a "pleasing fantasy for children".&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

The musical ''Sing for Your Supper'' also met with Congressional criticism, although its patriotic finale, "[[Ballad for Americans]]", was chosen as the theme song of the 1940 Republican National Convention.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

"'''Going to America'''" is the final episode of the [[Channel 4]] sitcom ''[[Father Ted]]''. It is the eighth episode of the third series and the 25th episode overall. The show's star [[Dermot Morgan]] died the day after filming was completed.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Batch 2091.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Father Kevin falls victim to depression.]]
After [[Father Ted Crilly|Ted]] prevents a [[clinical depression|depressed]] Father Kevin ([[Tommy Tiernan]]) from jumping to his death at the "It's Great Being a Priest" conference, an American priest, Father Buzz Cagney ([[Jeff Harding (actor)|Jeff Harding]]), asks him if he will come to a parish in [[Los Angeles]]. Ted cannot wait and excitedly tells [[Father Jack Hackett|Jack]], [[Father Dougal McGuire|Dougal]] and [[Mrs. Doyle]], who incorrectly think they will be able to come with him. Ted does not have the heart to tell them otherwise and brings them to the airport, leaving them there while he gets on the plane. However, Ted has second thoughts when Buzz mentions the gang culture around Ted's new parish in Los Angeles and its violent state. Realising he is in serious trouble, Ted abandons going on his trip and rejoins Jack, Dougal and Mrs Doyle. It transpires that the three of them never wanted to go to the States anyway, with the possible exception of Jack, who yells 'Feck!' when he learns of what has gone wrong, though the promise of a drink cheers him up. The group leaves the airport and heads for home, and Ted resigns himself to the fact he is probably never going to escape [[Craggy Island]].

===Alternate ending===
The episode was always intended to be the last ''[[Father Ted]]''; in the original script, the last scene was to be set at the "It's ''Still'' Great Being a Priest" conference with Father Kevin once again on the window ledge and once again Ted arriving on the ledge, except this time it is not to stop him from jumping but to join him, because he was depressed that the intended trip to America fell through and he would have to stay on Craggy Island forever. This ending was abandoned in favour of a montage of clips from all three series of the show, although this was not (as believed) because of the death of [[Dermot Morgan]]. Rather, the writers did not think that their original ending was very funny.

The episode was filmed on 27 February 1998, the day before Morgan died.

==Production==
This episode does not normally contain a credits sequence at the end, as it is replaced by the clips montage. The episode's guest cast is listed alongside the lead actors in the opening credits.

While filming the scene in which Ted dances to "[[Theme from Shaft|Theme from ''Shaft'']]," Tommy Tiernan continually flubbed his lines. As a result, Dermot Morgan was required to perform the dance repeatedly, despite pains in his heart. In a 2009 interview, Tiernan speculated that this contributed to Morgan's fatal heart attack the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/features/interviews/TOMMY%20TIERNAN%20IN%20THE%20CHAT%20ROOM/5849883.html?|title=TOMMY TIERNAN IN THE CHAT ROOM|work=hotpress.com|last=Tyaransen|first=Olaf|date=28 September 2009|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final shot is an exterior view of the parochial house at dusk. Ted and Dougal say goodnight to each other (stock audio from the episode "[[New Jack City]]") and the light in their bedroom is switched off.

==Trivia==
*Father Kevin is cured of his depression by listening to a cover of [[Issac Hayes]]' "[[Theme from Shaft|Theme from ''Shaft'']]" by Eddie &amp; the Soul Band, before falling back into depression by the song "[[Exit Music (For a Film)]]" by [[Radiohead]].
*[[Brian Eno]] makes a brief cameo appearance in the episode as Father Brian Eno. Linehan has claimed that the idea came as "we used to see him around [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] wearing a fez."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linehan|first1=Graham|title=Twitter post|url=https://twitter.com/Glinner/status/21351832408301568|website=Twitter|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When Ted discusses a fictional [[Harrison Ford]] film with Dougal, the details mentioned are identical to those of ''Firestorm'', a fictional film previously described by characters in the American sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4384">The '''Gurdjieff movements''' is a series of [[sacred dance]]s that were collected or authored by [[G. I. Gurdjieff]] and taught to his students as part of the work of ''self observation'' and ''self study''.

Gurdjieff taught that the movements were not merely [[calisthenics]], exercises in concentration, and displays of bodily coordination and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic sensibility]]: on the contrary, in the movements was embedded real, concrete knowledge, passed from generation to generation of initiates - each posture and gesture representing some cosmic [[truth]] that the informed observer could read like a book. Certain of Gurdjieff's followers claim that the Gurdjieff Movements can only be properly transmitted by those who themselves have been initiated in the direct line of Gurdjieff; otherwise, they say, it leads nowhere.

The movements are purportedly based upon traditional dances that Gurdjieff studied as he traveled throughout [[central Asia]], India, Tibet, the Orient and [[Africa]] where he encountered various Indo-European and [[Sufi]] orders, [[Buddhist]] centers and other sources of traditional culture and learning.&lt;ref name="ToussulisPh.D2011"&gt;{{cite book

There were literally thousands of movements collected and taught by Gurdjieff throughout his teaching career. The music for the movements was written by Gurdjieff and [[Thomas de Hartmann]], as well as British composer Edouard Michael.

A brief glimpse of the dances appears at the very end of the motion picture about Gurdjieff, ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men (film)|Meetings with Remarkable Men]]'', produced and directed in 1978 by [[Peter Brook]].&lt;ref name="PanafieuNeedleman1997"&gt;{{cite book

'''''In the Shadow of Your Wings''''' (Unter dem Schatten deiner Flügel) is a collection of selected entries from the diary of [[Jochen Klepper]] covering the period between April 1932 and 10 December 1942. The book appeared in 1956.

The [[Protestantism|Protestant]] German [[Author|writer]], [[journalist]] and [[poet]] of ecclesiastical songs, Jochen Klepper, loses his creative power in the course of the above-mentioned ten years under steadily increasing [[Nazi Germany|National Socialist]] reprisals. Klepper is married with the [[Jew]] Johanna. Hanni, as Johanna is called, has brought two daughters from her first marriage. Klepper's younger stepdaughter Renate is threatened with [[deportation]] after the [[World War II|war]] begins.  Klepper applies for an exit permit for the young girl to go to Sweden. The author appeals to the [[Sicherheitsdienst|security services]]. There his request is turned down. Klepper takes his own life together along the lives of his wife and child in a nondescript Berlin residential house.

== Diary ==
'''1932''' Klepper suffers from his childlessness. He calls himself a "[[Religion|religious]] [[Socialism|socialist]]".&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the 30-year-old author is narrow. But Klepper is fulfilled as an [[intellectual]] by big desire for fame.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1933''' To Kleppers understanding is not author who has merely ideas and materials. Author is who can express that quite peculiar "state of the liveliness"&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; in his text. Talent would be unnecessary.&lt;br/&gt;
The Nazis have now all power monopolized. Klepper is at the [[Radio]]&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; employed. He is denounced: "Jewish family. [[SPD]] member"&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; is the accusation. The active employees will be suspended from service. Still Klepper not despondent. Because he holds fast to his faith, writes in his novel "The Father, Novel of [[Frederick William I of Prussia|the Soldier-King]]" ([[Stuttgart]] 1937) and loves his wife Hanni. Is Klepper "divine tool"?&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; He has doubts.
Also  these odious "[[memoir]]s", which Klepper writes down - which value do they have? The writer will remain in the country at any rate. Abroad he sees no working possibility. Indeed, in Berlin the giants [[Ullstein-Verlag|Ullstein]] and [[Universum Film AG|Ufa]] want his cooperation, however, do not pay. Thus Klepper would like to be taken up in the [[:de:Reichsschrifttumskammer|Empire Literature Chamber]].&lt;br/&gt;
'''1934''' The plan succeeds, because one of his guarantors is a [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] man. Besides, Klepper calls the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] "ill visionaries",&lt;ref name="Source p. 145"&gt;Source p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; if he entrusts with his worry about the future of Germany the diary.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1935''' Clamour is not possible for Klepper. He lives under the motto "Keep still".&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; With such behavior a small private sphere can be saved. The excesses in [[Kurfürstendamm]] are disconcerting. Jewish women receive on the open road slaps in the face.&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of all that, Klepper further wants to write, as long as he may still remain in the Empire Literature Chamber. Since writing is a religious process for him. God has called the author and latter answers with a book - a stammered answer.&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
'''1936''' German relatives recommend to the couple Klepper repeatedly to send both daughters in the sure foreign country. Klepper said the precaution would be unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Quelle S. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The author probably knows about his isolation in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Quelle S. 223&lt;/ref&gt; however, he builds on the help of God.&lt;ref&gt;Quelle S. 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In '''1937''', on 25 March&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; the author from the Empire Literature Chamber is excluded. The reason is to Kleppers conviction his [[:de:Mischehe (Nationalsozialismus)|mixing marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusion is out on an appeal in June suspended, and the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Imperial War Department]] recommends Kleppers new novel "The Father" as a reading for the [[Wehrmacht]] members.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1938''' However, the Empire Literature Chamber accuses the [[Christian]] Klepper "of slavish posture" which would contradict the "new mind".&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; From March Klepper is supervised no more by the Empire Literature Chamber, but by the [[Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Ministry]]. Nevertheless, in this precarious situation there is still a courageous journalist, the Klepper his organ as a platform offers: The Protestant theologian [[:de:Hermann Mulert|Prof. Mulert]] encourages the author to write for the "Christian world". Klepper remains careful. If [[Ernst Wiechert]] sits, nevertheless, because of the case [[Martin Niemöller|Niemöller]] in the [[Buchenwald concentration camp|concentration camp]]. Klepper and his wife, Hanni register well as Jewish doctors and lawyers in Germany are no longer allowed to practice, how German Jews to sell their assets and emigrate. There should be a [[Buchenwald concentration camp|concentration camp]] near [[Weimar]]. Every German Jew should carry from [[:de:Namensänderungsverordnung|1st January, 1939]], in addition, the given name [[List of Biblical names#I|Israel]] or [[Sara (given name)|Sara]] and must give him everywhere. Polish Jews in Germany will be imprisoned or expelled. In spite of this news couple Klepper builds a new house in Berlin. In connection with the [[Kristallnacht]] Klepper disturb the arbitrary arrests of Jewish men by the [[Gestapo]]. Klepper's wife Hanni [[Religious conversion|converts]] to the Christianity. Klepper is horrified about Hannis [[:de:Kennkarte|identification card]].&lt;br/&gt;
'''1939''' Both stepdaughters Kleppers would like to [[Emigration|emigrate]]. Wife Hanni wants to remain. [[Nazism|NS]] [[Ideology|ideologist]] [[Alfred Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] speaks openly, all Jews should leave the [[German Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; German Jews must offer before certain valuables - as for example precious metals - to buying places to the sales.&lt;br/&gt;
When the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|war breaks out]], Klepper does a [[Patriotism|patriotic]] note in his diary: He could not Germany the decline wish.&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 468&lt;/ref&gt; As from November Jews for leaving their local authorized by the Gestapo need, Klepper expresses the suicide thought. Is [[suicide]] a sin? The older stepdaughter is the departure to England succeed. Because of the younger daughter Renate wants the couple to stay alive.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1940''' February: A rumour reaches Klepper. Jews would be deported by [[Szczecin]] to [[Lublin]].&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; As a wife of an "[[Aryan race|Aryan]]" Hanni is protected. However, for daughter Renate it becomes more and more dangerous: Men of the [[SS-Totenkopfverbände|Death's Head SS]] ring in the front door and inquire after the young girl. Renate converts - like before her mother - to the Christianity. Klepper receives news from an unfathomable process in the German Reich: [[Racial hygiene|Hindered]] are murdered. All called events weaken taken together the creativity of the sensitive Klepper so much that he manages the next novels ([[Katharina Luther|Katharina von Bora]]) no more. The vitality, however, he wants to keep. And thus he struggles dogged, tenaciously and, in the end, successfully for an entry permit for Renate to Sweden. For all that Klepper means on 26 July surprisingly, Germany will defeat England.&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 522, 4th Line up&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
'''1941''' From December, 1940 Klepper serves with the armed forces and will dismiss at the beginning of October, 1941 because of "military unworthiness", thus because of his "non-aryan marriage".&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin's Jews are now in a very hard situation. Renate must carry discriminating [[Yellow badge]] and brings terrifying news with home: Confessed become after [[Łódź|Litzmannstadt]] deports. The suicide thought lies to young Renate far. She hopes for survival. Klepper penetrates up to "[[Minister without Portfolio#Germany|Imperial Minister]] Dr. [[Wilhelm Frick|Frick]]" and obtains a document in which Renate ministerial protection from deportation is assured. This letter may Renates life admittedly only so long protected until the Sicherheitsdienst mercilessly intervenes. News about the deportation of Jews takes no end. Renate sways between depression and hope.
The girl tells the thoughts of suicide, if their departure fail should, not go back. News of massacres, perpetrated on Jews, invade from the east to Berlin.&lt;br/&gt;
'''1942''' Hanni rejects the thought of triple suicide. Klepper does not know whether he should condemn the German warfare. After tantalizing back-and-forth Renate from Sweden receives the desired entry permit. Frick is no more responsible, in the meantime, for the exit permit, but now [[Adolf Eichmann|Eichmann]]. Klepper does not receive the permission and goes voluntarily to the death.

== Title ==
Kleppers faith in God seems steadfast. An external sign of this deep religiousness are the omnipresent [[Bible#Old Testament|Bible]] citations. Under one of the verses stands the book:
:Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me,
:for my soul takes refuge in you.
:Yes, '''in the shadow of your wings''', I will take refuge,
:until disaster has passed. [[s:Bible (World English)/Psalms#Psalm 57|Psalm 57,1]]&lt;ref&gt;Source pp. 3, 208, 364, 530&lt;/ref&gt;
All citations reflect taken together upon the ten-year-period away the unprecedented God's trust and last imploring, yes, last of all shouting God in the highest need.

== Persons ==

Klepper reports about narrower contacts with writers: [[:de:Reinhold Schneider|Reinhold Schneider]]&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; and [[:de:Rudolf Alexander Schröder|Rudolf Alexander Schröder]]&lt;ref&gt;Source p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; are called multiple. Klepper mentions several prominent concentration camp prisoners - activists of the [[Confessing Church|Bekennenden Kirche]] - thus, e.g., the [[pastor]] [[:de:Hans Ehrenberg|Ehrenberg-Bochum]].

== Style and themes ==

The extensive memoirs can be read as a dialog with God. Klepper lays his welfare and woe in the hands of the Lord. However, besides, Klepper knows that he "one day", as [[Werner Bergengruen|Bergengruen]]&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 262, 14th Bottom line&lt;/ref&gt; formulates a little disrespectfully, before "his heavenly commander" will have to be responsible for his acting and letting. The form arises from the said. Klepper, deeply religious, has torn to and fro. He knows, he does mistakes, but he cannot from his skin. Among the wings of the Lord standing, the fate of the author's resume. And Klepper meticulously describes the process. The honesty and independence of the author is impressive with all. Before the surprised reader enters less the fighter Klepper than rather the silent sufferer.

== Reception ==
*Bergengruen&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka pp. 259 - 268&lt;/ref&gt; does in January, 1957 in his detailed review to the first publication of the diaries no secret from his quite obviously deeply to seated resentments.
**It looks as subordinate Bergengruen of sister Hildegard  of the author material motives in the publication of the diaries of brother.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;
**Bergengruen speaks a truth. Renate's life was as of a "[[Nuremberg Laws|full Jew]]" - as one said in the [[:de:Sprache des Nationalsozialismus|NS linguistic usage]] - threatens in the German Reich. Klepper has had long enough time to support the emigration of the girl.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Bergengruen can conclude in the connection from the memoirs neither on feelings of guilt nor on selfdoubt of the author.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka pp. 266 bottom - 267 top&lt;/ref&gt;
**To an opponent of the Nazi regime the subservien Klepper could not explain itself.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;
**Indeed, Bergengruen certifies mental power to the author, however, it lacks him of feeling and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;
**Bergengruen also calls details which are not discoverable in the available book: For example, when he Klepper after October 1941, in his Berlin home visits, the blended man of the house has glorified his period of service with the armed forces and has regretted his forcible elimination from the troop.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Hackelsberger, Taschka pp. 264, 267&lt;/ref&gt;
*Klepper should have taken away his diaries from the access of the NS henchmen successfully, while he buried the papers.&lt;ref&gt;Riegel, van Rinsum p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''La Garçonne''''' (''The Bachelor Girl'' or ''The Flapper'') is a [[French films of 1936|1936]] French [[black-and-white]] [[film adaptation]] of the [[La Garçonne (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Victor Margueritte]].  It was directed by [[Jean de Limur]], and starred [[Marie Bell]] (in the title role), [[Arletty]] and [[Edith Piaf]].

==Plot==
The eponymous ''garçonne'' or [[flapper]] is Monique Lerbier, an emancipated French woman who leaves home to escape a [[marriage of convenience]] to a man she does not love which her parents have forced on her.  She then falls into all sorts of carnal temptations and artificial pleasures previously unknown to her.  These include her being seduced into a [[lesbianism|lesbian]] love affair by a chanteuse character (played by [[Edith Piaf]]), ensuring the film became a [[succès de scandale]].  Another actress in the film, [[Arletty]], said of it:
{{cquote|It was advanced, as an idea.  Victor Margueritte, the author of the novel, took a major part in the production process.  I maintained Marie Bell, in the film.  One of the last times we saw each other, shortly before her death, we recalled this memory.  "I maintained you in ''La Garçonne''", I said to her, "and luckily this was not real life, otherwise you would have cost me dearly!"  It has to be said of Marie that she was not cheap to keep!  And how we laughed! [...]  The film was a success thanks to the scandal it provoked.  Seeing "bonnes femmes" as flappers, smoking opium [...] Seeing female homosexuals, in that epoque!"
&lt;!---French original - [[Arletty]] : C’était avancé, comme idée. [[Victor Margueritte]], l’auteur du roman, avait eu plusieurs procès. J’entretenais [[Marie Bell]], dans le film. Une des dernières fois où nous nous sommes vues, peu de temps avant sa mort, nous avons évoqué ce souvenir. « Je t’entretenais dans ''La Garçonne'', lui ai-je dit, heureusement que ce n’était pas dans la vie, tu m’aurais coûté cher ! » Il faut dire que Marie de devait pas être bon marché ! Et nous avons bien ri ! […] Le film a été un succès grâce au scandale qu’il provoque. Voir des « bonnes femmes » en garçonnes, fumant l’opium… […] Voir des homosexuelles-femmes, à cette époque-là ! ---&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Extract from ''Arletty ou la liberté d’être'', biography by Christian Gilles, [[Éditions Séguier|Librairie Séguier]], Paris, [[1988 in literature|1988]], {{ISBN|2-906284-86-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Lineography''' is the [[art]] of drawing without lifting the pen, pencil, or paintbrush that is being used.&lt;ref name="Maloney"&gt;{{ citation | last = Davis | first = Ken | authorlink =  | title = Thinking Inside the Box | journal = Unitrin Specialty Update | volume =  | issue =  | date = 2007-01-02 | page = 10 | url = http://leannmaloney.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/unitrinspecialtyupdatev2_jan07.pdf }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Royalfestivalhall.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Festival Hall]], London, the main base of the orchestra]]
The '''London Philharmonic Orchestra''' ('''LPO''') is one of five permanent symphony [[orchestras]] based in London. It was founded by the conductors [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]] and [[Malcolm Sargent]] in 1932 as a rival to the existing [[London Symphony Orchestra|London Symphony]] and [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]]s.

The founders' ambition was to build an orchestra the equal of any European or American rival. Between 1932 and the Second World War the LPO was widely judged to have succeeded in this regard. After the outbreak of war, the orchestra's private backers withdrew and the players reconstituted the LPO as a self-governing cooperative. In the post-war years, the orchestra faced challenges from two new rivals; the [[Philharmonia Orchestra|Philharmonia]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra|Royal Philharmonic]], founded respectively in 1946 and 1947, achieved a quality of playing not matched by the older orchestras, including the LPO.

By the 1960s the LPO had regained its earlier standards, and in 1964 it secured a valuable engagement to play in the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne Festival]] opera house during the summer months. In 1993 it was appointed resident orchestra of the [[Royal Festival Hall]] on the south bank of the [[River Thames|Thames]], one of London's major concert venues. Since 1995 the residency has been jointly held with the Philharmonia. In addition to its work at the Festival Hall and Glyndebourne, the LPO performs regularly at the [[Congress Theatre (Eastbourne)|Congress Theatre]], [[Eastbourne]] and the [[Brighton Dome]], and tours nationally and internationally.

Since Beecham, the orchestra has had ten principal conductors, including [[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]], [[Bernard Haitink]], [[Georg Solti|Sir Georg Solti]], [[Klaus Tennstedt]] and [[Vladimir Jurowski]]. The orchestra has been active in recording studios since its earliest days, and has played on hundreds of sets made by [[EMI Classics|EMI]], [[Decca Records|Decca]] and other companies. Since 2005 the LPO has had its own record label, issuing live recordings of concerts. The orchestra has played on numerous film soundtracks, including ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962) and the ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy (2001–03).

==History==

===Background===
In the 1920s the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO) was the city's best-known concert and recording orchestra. Others were the [[Royal Albert Hall]] Orchestra, the orchestra of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]], the [[BBC]]'s Wireless Symphony Orchestra and [[Henry Wood|Sir Henry Wood]]'s [[Queen's Hall]] Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/917033 "The B.B.C."], ''[[The Musical Times]]'', 1 January 1928, p. 70 {{subscription}}; and Elkin, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; All except the last of these were essentially ''ad hoc'' ensembles, with little continuity of personnel,{{refn|Despite the efforts of Wood, Beecham and others, the deputy system remained a traditional part of the London orchestral scene. A player booked for a concert could accept a better-paid engagement and send a substitute in his stead. The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society described the system thus: "A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without your knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away."&lt;ref&gt;Levien, John Mewburn, ''quoted'' in Reid (1961), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} and none approached the excellence of the best continental and American orchestras. This became obvious in 1927 when the [[Berlin Philharmonic]], under [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]], gave two concerts at the Queen's Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Elkin, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; The chief music critic of ''[[The Times]]'' later commented, "the British public&amp;nbsp;... was electrified when it heard the disciplined precision of the Berlin Philharmonic&amp;nbsp;... This apparently was how an orchestra could, and, therefore, ought to sound".&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Elkin, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; After the Berliners, London heard a succession of major foreign orchestras, including the Amsterdam [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]] under [[Willem Mengelberg]] and the [[New York Philharmonic|Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of New York]] under [[Arturo Toscanini]].&lt;ref name=patmore&gt;Patmore, David. [http://search.proquest.com/docview/968184?accountid=17321 "EMI, Sir Thomas Beecham, and the formation of the London Philharmonic Orchestra"], ''ARSC Journal'', 32(1), 2001, pp. 11–27 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sir-Thomas-Beecham-US-1948.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]], founding father and first conductor of the LPO]]
Among those determined that London should have a permanent orchestra of similar excellence were [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Sir John Reith]], director-general of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), and the conductor [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]]. In 1928 they opened discussions about jointly setting up such an ensemble, but after 18 months of negotiations it became clear that the corporation and the conductor had irreconcilable priorities. Beecham demanded more personal control of the orchestra and repertoire than the BBC was willing to concede, and his priorities were the opera house and the concert hall rather than the broadcasting studio.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, Nicholas. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/961148 "Beecham and the BBC Symphony Orchestra: A Collaboration that Never Happened"], ''[[The Musical Times]]'', October 1980, pp. 625–628 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC went ahead without him, and under its director of music, [[Adrian Boult]], launched the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] in October 1930, to immense acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;"Music", ''The Times'', 23 October 1930, p. 12; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/914348 "London Concerts"], ''The Musical Times'', December 1930, pp. 1124–1127 {{subscription}}; and "Music", ''The Observer'', 26 October 1930, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 Beecham was approached by the rising young conductor [[Malcolm Sargent]] with a proposal to set up a permanent, salaried orchestra with a subsidy guaranteed by Sargent's patrons, the [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Courtauld]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Aldous, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Originally Sargent and Beecham envisaged a reshuffled version of the LSO, but the orchestra, a self-governing body, balked at weeding out and replacing underperforming players. In 1932 Beecham lost patience and agreed with Sargent to set up a new orchestra from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Reid (1968), p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC having attracted a large number of the finest musicians from other orchestras, many in the musical world doubted that Beecham could find enough good players.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 16; and Jenkins, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; He was fortunate in the timing of the enterprise: the depressed economy had severely reduced the number of freelance dates available to orchestral players.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Beecham himself was a strong attraction to many musicians: he later commented, "I always get the players. Among other considerations, they are so good they refuse to play under anybody but me."&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of the foundation of the LPO, David Patmore writes, "The combination of steady work, occasionally higher than usual rates, variety of performance and Beecham's own magnetic personality would make such an offering irresistible to many orchestral musicians."&lt;ref name=patmore/&gt;

Beecham and Sargent had financial backing from leading figures in commerce, including [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]], [[Robert Mayer (philanthropist)|Robert Mayer]] and [[Frédéric Alfred d'Erlanger|Baron Frédéric d'Erlanger]],&lt;ref name=t1&gt;"London Philharmonic Orchestra", ''The Times'', 9 September 1932, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and secured profitable contracts to record for [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] and play for the Royal Philharmonic Society, the [[Royal Choral Society]], the Courtauld-Sargent Concerts, Mayer's concerts for children, and the international opera season at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

During his earlier negotiations with the BBC Beecham had proposed the title "London Philharmonic Orchestra",&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, pp. 20–22&lt;/ref&gt; which was now adopted for the new ensemble. With the aid of the impresario [[Harold Holt]] and other influential and informed contacts he recruited 106 players. They included a few young musicians straight from music college, many established players from provincial orchestras, and 17 of the LSO's leading members.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; During the early years, the orchestra was led by [[Paul Beard (violinist)|Paul Beard]] and [[David McCallum, Sr.|David McCallum]], and included leading players such as James Bradshaw, [[Gwydion Brooke]], [[Geoffrey Gilbert]], [[Léon Goossens]], [[Gerald Jackson]], [[Reginald Kell]], [[Anthony Pini]] and [[Bernard Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 135–141&lt;/ref&gt; Holt became the LPO's business manager, and the management board included the orchestra's principal benefactors: Courtauld, Mayer and d'Erlanger.&lt;ref name="t1"/&gt;

After twelve rehearsals, the orchestra made its debut at the Queen's Hall on 7 October 1932, conducted by Beecham.{{refn|In earlier years Beecham had been notoriously late for rehearsals, usually arriving an hour after the appointed time,&lt;ref&gt;Reid (1961), pp. 84 and 92&lt;/ref&gt; but now he assumed a new seriousness, always arriving punctually.&lt;ref&gt;Reid (1961), p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}   After the first item, Berlioz's ''[[Overtures by Hector Berlioz#Le carnaval romain|Roman Carnival Overture]]'', the audience went wild, some of them standing on their seats to clap and shout.&lt;ref name=r18&gt;Russell, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' [[Ernest Newman]] wrote, "Nothing so electrifying has been heard in a London concert room for years. The tone was magnificent, the precision perfect, the reading a miracle of fire and beauty, and the enthusiasm of the audience could not have been greater."&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Ernest, ''The Sunday Times'', 9 October 1932, ''quoted'' in Moore (unnumbered page)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Times'' [[H. C. Colles|H C Colles]] said that the LPO was "as fine an instrument as could be wished for"; [[Neville Cardus]] wrote in ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', "nothing more sumptuous and daring in orchestral playing could be heard in more than three other cities between New York and Vienna"; and [[Walter J. Turner|W J Turner]], of ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', praised the orchestra's "youthful dash and virtuosity&amp;nbsp;... at last we have an independent orchestra which rivals the BBC Symphony Orchestra".&lt;ref&gt;"Royal Philharmonic Society", ''The Times'', 8 October 1932, p. 10; Cardus, Neville. "London's new orchestra", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 8 October 1932, p. 18; and Turner, W J. "The World of Music", ''The Illustrated London News'', 22 October 1932, p. 638&lt;/ref&gt;

In its first season the LPO played at eighteen concerts in the Courtauld-Sargent series; ten Royal Philharmonic Society concerts; fifteen "International Celebrity Tours" and sixteen Sunday afternoon concerts for Holt's agency, as well as Robert Mayer's children's concerts, Royal Choral Society evenings and other engagements.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt; Soloists in the first season included the singer [[Eva Turner]] and the pianists [[Harriet Cohen]] and [[Clifford Curzon]].&lt;ref&gt;"London Philharmonic Orchestra", ''The Times'', 22 September 1932, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1932 the sixteen-year-old [[Yehudi Menuhin]] played a programme of violin concertos; those by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] were conducted by Beecham, and the [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]] [[Violin Concerto (Elgar)|concerto]] was conducted by the composer.&lt;ref&gt;"Concert", ''The Times'', 22 November 1932, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

During the next eight years, the LPO appeared nearly a hundred times at the Queen's Hall for the Royal Philharmonic Society, played for Beecham's opera seasons at Covent Garden, and made more than 300 gramophone records.&lt;ref name=jefferson89&gt;Jefferson, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|This figure refers to discs rather than whole works. The 78&amp;nbsp;rpm recordings then in use required several discs to accommodate a symphony or concerto of even moderate length.&lt;ref&gt;Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of works, as opposed to discs, recorded by the LPO and Beecham was less than a hundred.&lt;ref name=s443/&gt;|group= n}} There were a few guest conductors for the Sunday concerts, but most were conducted by Beecham.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In the Courtauld-Sargent series the LPO played not only under Sargent but under many guests including [[Bruno Walter]], [[George Szell]], [[Fritz Busch]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;"Courtauld-Sargent Concerts – Herr Walter's Visit", ''The Times'', 17 January 1933, p. 10; "Courtauld-Sargent Concerts", ''The Times'', 2 October 1933, p. 8; "Courtauld-Sargent Concerts", ''The Times'', 31 July 1934, p. 12; and "Courtauld-Sargent Concerts", ''The Times'', 19 October 1937, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to London engagements, the orchestra played regularly in the larger provincial cities and towns. Its first tour, in March and April 1933, started in Bristol and ended in Manchester, taking in thirteen other venues in England, Ireland and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; After the last concert, ''The Manchester Guardian's'' reviewer wrote:
{{quote|Never before in our experience of concert-going in Manchester have we heard orchestral playing which, throughout a whole programme, combined such nobility of style and brilliancy of execution – not the brilliancy that stops when it has made outward forms sparkle, but a quality that seems to work from within and to suffuse everything with a rich and glowing tone-colour.&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Thomas Beecham's Orchestra", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 3 April 1933, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Beecham took the orchestra on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the tour, the orchestra ignored the custom of playing the [[Nazi]] anthem before concerts, but Beecham yielded to pressure from [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s government not to play the [[Symphony No. 4 (Mendelssohn)|''Italian'' Symphony]] by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], taboo to Nazi [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semites]]. There was disquiet among some of the players that their presence in Germany gave the Nazi regime a propaganda coup.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 39–40, and 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===War and post-war years===
As his sixtieth birthday approached in 1939, Beecham was advised by his doctors to take a year's break from conducting, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate, leaving the orchestra in other hands.&lt;ref name=Lucas239&gt;Lucas, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, while he strove to secure the future of the orchestra, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared.&lt;ref name=reid218&gt;Reid (1961), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; The original LPO company was liquidated and Beecham raised large sums of money for the orchestra, helping its members to form themselves into a self-governing body.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Queen's-Hall-1912.jpg|thumb|[[Queen's Hall]], destroyed, with many LPO instruments, by bombing in 1941]]
During the war the LPO played in the capital and on continual tours of Britain, under Sargent and other conductors, bringing orchestral concerts to places where they had rarely if ever been given. Many of the players' instruments were lost when the Queen's Hall was destroyed by German bombing in May 1941; an appeal was broadcast by the BBC, the response to which was enormous, with instruments donated by the public enabling the orchestra to continue.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

On Beecham's return to England in 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert together that drew superlatives from the critics.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Glock|Glock, William]], "Music", ''[[The Observer]]'' 8 October 1944, p. 2; and "Sir T. Beecham's Return", ''The Times'', 9 October 1944, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, declined to give him the unfettered control that he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again it would be as a paid employee of the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Reid (1961), p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; Beecham, unwilling to be answerable to anybody, left the LPO and in 1946 founded a rival orchestra, the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra|Royal Philharmonic]] (RPO).&lt;ref name=reid231&gt;Reid (1961), p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the conductors making guest appearances in the early post-war period were Walter, Furtwängler, [[Victor de Sabata]] and [[Sergiu Celibidache]].&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Such starry events were the exception; as a rule the orchestra worked with less eminent conductors, giving an unprecedented number of performances. In 1949–50 they gave 248 concerts, compared with 103 by the London Symphony Orchestra and 32 each by the [[Philharmonia]] and RPO.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; After a seven-year interregnum the orchestra engaged a new principal conductor, [[Eduard van Beinum]], in 1947.  He was initially able to work with the orchestra for only six months of the year, because of restrictions on work permits for foreign nationals. Guest conductors stood in during his absences. In 1947 the [[London Philharmonic Choir]] was founded as the chorus for the LPO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpc.org.uk/about.html "About the Choir"] London Philharmonic Choir, retrieved 4 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s===
Van Beinum's poor health obliged him to resign in 1950. Sir Adrian Boult, who had been forced out of the BBC by internal politics, accepted an invitation from the LPO's managing director, Thomas Russell, to take up the principal conductorship.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; With Boult the LPO began a series of commercial recordings, beginning with Elgar's ''[[Falstaff (Elgar)|Falstaff]]'', Mahler's ''[[Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen]]'' with the [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Blanche Thebom]], and Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First Symphony]].&lt;ref name="Kennedy 231"&gt;Kennedy, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the new team was greeted with approval by reviewers. Of the Elgar, the reviewer in ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|The Gramophone]]'' wrote, "I have heard no other conductor approach [Boult's] performance.&amp;nbsp;... His newly adopted orchestra responds admirably".&lt;ref&gt;''The Gramophone'', May 1951, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1951 Boult and the LPO made a tour of Germany, described by Boult's biographer [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] as "gruelling", with twelve concerts in as many days.&lt;ref name=kb&gt;Kennedy, p. 232; and Boult, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Kennedy states that there were 11 concerts, but Boult lists 12 dates and venues.&lt;ref name=kb/&gt;|group= n}} The symphonies they played were Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Seventh]], Haydn's [[Symphony No. 104 (Haydn)|''London'', No 104]], Brahms's [[Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)|First]], Schumann's [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|Fourth]] and Schubert's [[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|''Great C major'']]. The other works were Elgar's [[Introduction and Allegro (Elgar)|Introduction and Allegro]], Holst's ''[[The Perfect Fool]]'' ballet music, [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'', and Stravinsky's ''[[The Firebird|Firebird]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Boult, p. 202; and Kennedy, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Conductors of the 1951–52 season other than Boult included [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[William Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Royal Festival Hall and Shot Tower c1959.jpg|thumb|left|The Royal Festival Hall in the 1950s: the LPO was among the orchestras striving for residency]]
In 1952, the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with [[Decca Records]] that was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 percent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist party]];&lt;ref name="Kennedy 231"/&gt; when the [[Cold War|cold war]] began, some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be "seriously jeopardized financially" if Russell remained in post.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, pp. 215–222&lt;/ref&gt; A later writer, [[Richard Witts]], suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the [[Royal Festival Hall]].{{refn|Witts concludes that it was not Russell but Boult – regarded by some as past his peak – who cost the LPO the Festival Hall residency.&lt;ref&gt;Witts, Richard.

The following year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including [[Paul Kletzki]], [[Jean Martinon]], [[Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt]], [[Georg Solti]], [[Walter Susskind]] and Vaughan Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Donald. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/933482 "Promenade Concerts"], ''The Musical Times'', October 1953, p. 472 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 the LPO toured the [[Soviet Union]], the first British orchestra to do so; the conductors were Boult, [[Anatole Fistoulari]] and [[George Hurst (conductor)|George Hurst]], and the soloists were [[Alfredo Campoli]] and [[Moura Lympany]].&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, Maurice. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/936914 "The London Philharmonic Orchestra in Russia"], ''The Musical Times'', February 1957, pp. 67–69 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the tour Boult retired as principal conductor, but remained closely associated with the orchestra, and was made its President in 1965. Most of his stereophonic recordings for [[EMI Classics|EMI]] were made with the LPO.&lt;ref&gt;Simeone and Mundy, pp. 81–96; and Pirouet, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the middle and late 1950s the LPO worked with new conductors including [[Constantin Silvestri]] and [[Josef Krips]]. This was a bad period financially for the orchestra, and it was forced to abandon fixed contracts for its players with holiday and sick pay and pensions, and revert to payment by engagement.&lt;ref name=moore&gt;Moore (unnumbered page)&lt;/ref&gt; Financial disaster was averted thanks to an anonymous benefactor, generally believed to be Boult.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; A historian of the orchestra, Edmund Pirouet, writes that having been on an upward curve in the 1940s, by the mid-1950s the orchestra "was at best marking time".&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 the LPO appointed [[William Steinberg]], also music director of the [[Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra]], as chief conductor. He was a noted orchestral trainer, and did much to restore playing standards to their former levels.&lt;ref name=moore/&gt; Steinberg resigned the LPO post after two seasons, advised by his doctor to restrict his activities.&lt;ref&gt;"Dr Steinberg leaving London Philharmonic", ''The Guardian'', 1 August 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s and 70s===
[[File:Glyndebourne 2.jpg|thumb|Glyndebourne, where the LPO took over as resident orchestra in 1964]]
In 1962 the orchestra undertook its first tour of India, Australia, and the Far East. The conductors were Sargent and [[John Pritchard (conductor)|John Pritchard]]. The latter was appointed the LPO's chief conductor in 1962, presiding over what one player described as "an era of supremely good taste".&lt;ref name=moore/&gt; From its outset in 1932, harpists (traditionally female) excepted, the orchestra had maintained Beecham's "men only" regime; in 1963 the rule was dropped, the first woman violinist was recruited, and within two years female players achieved equal conditions of membership with their male colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Pritchard was also music director of [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]] in [[Sussex]], and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the LPO replaced the RPO as Glyndebourne's resident orchestra, providing the players with stable guaranteed work in the slack summer months.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, pp. 132 and 134&lt;/ref&gt; The number of LPO concerts in the provinces fell during the 1960s, and ceased to be a major factor in the orchestra's finances.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, pp. 139&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s the orchestra gave fund-raising concerts in which guests from outside the world of classical music appeared, including [[Danny Kaye]], [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Tony Bennett]].&lt;ref name=moore/&gt; Its regular complement at the end of the decade was 88 players.&lt;ref&gt;Peacock, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bernard Haitink 1984b.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Bernard Haitink]], principal conductor, 1967–79]] 
In 1967 the LPO appointed [[Bernard Haitink]] as its principal conductor. He remained with the orchestra for twelve years, to date (2018) the longest tenure of the post. His concerts made a strong impression with the public, and within months the LPO was playing to ninety per cent capacity audiences at the Festival Hall, far outstripping the other London orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Among the composers with whom Haitink was associated were [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]] and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], whose symphonies featured frequently in the LPO's concerts during the Haitink period, as did those of [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], particularly the [[Symphony No. 10 (Shostakovich)|Tenth]], which Pirouet describes as the calling card of the orchestra and conductor.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]], Haitink and the LPO gave a six-concert cycle of the Beethoven symphonies and piano concertos, for which the Festival Hall was full to capacity. In ''The Times'', Joan Chissell described the orchestra's playing as "worthy of any festival".&lt;ref&gt;Chissell, Joan. "LPO/Haitink", ''The Times'', 18 March 1974, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; There was some discontent within the LPO that Haitink's prolific recordings were almost always with the other orchestra of which he was the chief conductor, the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. Pirouet comments that as Haitink recorded exclusively for the Dutch firm [[Philips Records|Philips]] it was to be expected that the Amsterdam orchestra would be preferred, and in any case the LPO was recording extensively with Boult, Solti, [[Daniel Barenboim]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s international tours continued, with itineraries taking in the US, Western Europe, the Soviet Union, and, in 1972, China, long inaccessible to Western musicians, where the orchestra met an enthusiastic welcome.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 the LPO was caught up in a recurring phenomenon of London orchestral life: the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is too much for one city, and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge.&lt;ref name=p155/&gt; On this occasion the targets were the LPO and the New Philharmonia; the latter, a self-governing body formed under its new name when the Philharmonia was disbanded in 1964, was going through a bad patch, professionally and financially. The proposed merger would inevitably have led to redundancies, and the player-owners of both orchestras rejected the plan.&lt;ref name=p155&gt;Pirouet, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sir George Solti 6 Allan Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georg Solti|Sir Georg Solti]], principal conductor, 1979–83]]
One of the constant difficulties of London orchestras was the lack of good rehearsal space and facilities. In 1973, acting jointly with the LSO, the LPO acquired and began restoring a disused church in [[Southwark]], converting it into the [[Henry Wood Hall, London|Henry Wood Hall]], a convenient and acoustically excellent rehearsal space and recording studio, opened in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Mann (critic)|Mann, William]]. "The making of a rehearsal hall", ''The Times'', 17 June 1975, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Guest conductors in the 1970s included [[Erich Leinsdorf]], [[Carlo Maria Giulini]], [[Eugen Jochum]], [[Riccardo Chailly]], [[Klaus Tennstedt]] and Solti. When Haitink announced in 1977 that he would step down as principal conductor at the end of the 1978–79 season, Solti, who had been principal guest conductor since 1971, agreed to succeed him.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s and 90s===
In 1982 the orchestra celebrated its [[golden jubilee]].{{refn|A contemporaneous book listed the many famous soloists who had worked with the LPO in its fifty years. Among them were [[soprano]]s and [[mezzo-soprano|mezzos]] such as [[Janet Baker]], [[Victoria de los Ángeles]], [[Kirsten Flagstad]], [[Leontyne Price]], [[Elisabeth Schumann]], [[Joan Sutherland]] and Eva Turner, [[tenors]] including [[Beniamino Gigli]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and [[Richard Tauber]]; the cellists [[Pablo Casals]] and [[Jacqueline du Pré]]; the violinists [[Jascha Heifetz]], [[Fritz Kreisler]] and [[David Oistrakh]], and the pianists [[Alfred Brendel]], Clifford Curzon, [[Wilhelm Kempff]], [[Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli]], [[Maurizio Pollini]] and [[Arthur Rubinstein]].&lt;ref name=moore/&gt;|group= n}} At the anniversary concert Solti conducted the programme with which Beecham had inaugurated the LPO. Pirouet comments that with the exception of [[Frederick Delius|Delius]]'s ''[[Brigg Fair#Delius orchestral setting|Brigg Fair]]'', the music was as ideally suited to Solti's musical persona as to Beecham's.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Edward Greenfield]] wrote, "I doubt if the LPO has ever played so beautifully, even in the days of Beecham".&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Edward. "LPO/Solti – 50th anniversary", ''The Guardian'', 8 October 1982, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Solti stepped down at the end of the jubilee season, and was succeeded by Klaus Tennstedt, of whom ''The Times'' commented, "Tennstedt found the orchestra sensitive and flexible, and his players regarded him with a warmth that is by no means universally extended by musicians to their conductors".&lt;ref name=tten&gt;"Klaus Tennstedt", ''The Times'', 13 January 1998, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; His time as chief conductor (1983–87) was celebrated for its musical achievements, but was marked by his failing health and frequent cancellations. As with Haitink and Solti, Bruckner and Mahler were prominent in the LPO's concerts with Tennstedt. Unlike his two predecessors Tennstedt preferred to record with the LPO rather than major continental or American orchestras; among the many sets they made together was a complete cycle of Mahler's symphonies for EMI.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Edward. "A German vision for London music", ''The Guardian'', 13 January 1998, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;      In 1984 the LPO and the Philharmonia{{refn|The New Philharmonia had bought back the rights to the original title in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;"Orchestra resumes its old title", ''The Times'', 2 September 1977, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} began negotiations that went on for years following an [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] proposal to name one London orchestra as the principal resident orchestra of the Festival Hall, with concomitant extra funding. The two orchestras were interested in making a counter-proposal for a joint residency, but the matter was not resolved until 1995 when their plan was finally implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, pp. 183 and 223&lt;/ref&gt; From the outset of the LPO's existence as a self-governing co-operative in 1939, its chief executive had always been appointed from within the orchestra's ranks. In 1985 this tradition was broken with the recruitment of John Willan, a qualified accountant as well as an alumnus of the [[Royal Academy of Music]] and a successful recording producer for EMI.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Welser-Möst-crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Welser-Möst]], principal conductor, 1990–96]]
In August 1987 Tennstedt, taken ill at a rehearsal, felt so unequal to continuing in his post that he resigned on the spot. He continued to appear with the LPO as a guest, with the title of "conductor laureate";&lt;ref name=tten/&gt; in 1989 [[Richard Morrison (music critic)|Richard Morrison]] of ''The Times'' wrote that the LPO still played better for Tennstedt than for anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Richard. "Mahler's quiet hero", ''The Times'', 17 February 1989, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Tennstedt's resignation was a severe blow to the orchestra, and there was no obvious successor: Morrison observed that the best-known conductors – Barenboim, [[Riccardo Muti]] and [[Simon Rattle]] – with whom the orchestra was then associated were committed to other projects until the 1990s, and those possible contenders such as [[Semyon Bychkov (conductor)|Semyon Bychkov]] and [[Franz Welser-Möst]] were largely unknown in London.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Richard. "Tennstedt hard to replace", ''The Times'', 26 August 1987, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; No successor was appointed until 1990 when Welser-Möst was named as the new principal conductor. His tenure was controversial; he received the nickname "Frankly Worse than Most" and many harshly critical reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Hewett, Ivan.

"And lost at sea", ''The Times'', 22 May 1996, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Welser-Möst's period as principal conductor coincided with the installation of the LPO as the sole resident orchestra of the Festival Hall. This proved a mixed blessing: the Southbank Centre management now had a say over concert programming, and insisted on the inclusion of works by obscure composers{{refn|Pirouet singles out [[Nikolai Roslavets]] as the most extreme example.&lt;ref name=p208/&gt;|group= n}} which did severe damage to box-office receipts.&lt;ref name=p208&gt;Pirouet, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 another official attempt to create a "super-orchestra" at the expense of one or more of the existing London ensembles briefly damaged relations between the LPO and the Philharmonia, but the idea was quickly abandoned, and in 1995, with the consent of the Arts Council, the two orchestras agreed to share the residency at the Festival Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, pp. 217–220, and 223&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, with the government of South Africa now moving towards majority rule, the orchestra accepted an invitation to tour there.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Welser-Möst concluded his LPO tenure in 1996, after what ''The Guardian'' called "a fraught few years in which the high hopes placed in him were somehow not fulfilled."&lt;ref&gt;Chancellor, Alexander.

===21st century===
[[File:Юровский иконка.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vladimir Jurowski]], principal conductor from 2007]]
After the departure of Welser-Möst, the LPO was without a principal conductor for four years. During the interregnum the orchestra inaugurated its "Roots Classical Fusions" series, which aimed to combine musical traditions from around the world; this was part of an education and community programme launched by the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpo.org.uk/about/history.html "History"], London Philharmonic Orchestra, retrieved 6 September&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Masur]] was the LPO's principal conductor from 2000 to 2007. Under Masur, known for his performances of the German symphonic repertoire, the orchestra regained its musical form, and the critic Richard S Ginell commented that [[Vladimir Jurowski]], who took over in 2007 "has inherited an LPO in splendid technical shape, probably having been drilled to a fare-thee-well under Masur".&lt;ref&gt;Ginell, Richard S. "Orchestral Upheavals: Gergiev and Jurowski in London", ''American Record Guide'', July 2008, pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurowski had first conducted the LPO in 2001, making an immediate mark in a programme of Finnish, French and Russian music. The reviewer in ''The Daily Telegraph'' wrote of "love at first sight between conductor and orchestra&amp;nbsp;... one of the LPO's finest hours in the concert hall".&lt;ref&gt;Rye, Matthew. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4727030/Last-minute-stand-in-makes-an-electrifying-debut.html "Last-minute stand-in makes an electrifying debut"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 17 December 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Jurowski became principal guest conductor in 2003, and conducted the orchestra in June 2007 during the concerts marking the re-opening of the refurbished Festival Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Tim. [http://music.guardian.co.uk/classical/livereviews/story/0,,2103890,00.html LPO/Jurowski], ''The Guardian'', 15 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007 Jurowski became the LPO's eleventh principal conductor. In November 2007, the LPO named [[Yannick Nézet-Séguin]] as its new principal guest conductor, effective from the 2008–09 season.&lt;ref&gt;Shihoten, Kevin. [http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/7385.html "Nézet-Séguin Named London Phil Principal Guest Conductor"], ''Playbill Arts'', 20 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Like his LPO predecessors Pritchard and Haitink, Jurowski was appointed music director of Glyndebourne (2001–13); he conducted the LPO there in operas by Britten, Mozart, [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], Richard Strauss, [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://glyndebourne.com/archive/individual/vladimir-jurowski "Vladimir Jurowski"], Glyndebourne, retrieved 8 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the leading members of the LPO organisation were Jurowski, [[Andrés Orozco-Estrada]] (principal guest conductor), Pieter Schoeman (leader), [[Magnus Lindberg]] (composer in residence) and Timothy Walker (chief executive and artistic director).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpo.org.uk/about/musician-biographies/ "Who's who in the orchestra"], London Philharmonic Orchestra, retrieved 26 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen of the orchestra's principal players held professorships at British conservatoires, including the Royal Academy of Music, the [[Royal College of Music]], [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]] and [[Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpo.org.uk/about/professorial-appointments.html "Professorial appointments"], London Philharmonic Orchestra, retrieved 26 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its regular concerts at the Festival Hall, and its annual season in the orchestra pit at Glyndebourne, the LPO has residencies at the [[Congress Theatre (Eastbourne)|Congress Theatre]], [[Eastbourne]] and the [[Brighton Dome]], and tours in Britain and overseas remain an important part of the orchestra's schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpo.org.uk/about/on-tour.html "Where we play"], London Philharmonic Orchestra, retrieved 26 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
In its early years, the LPO recorded exclusively for Columbia, a division of EMI. The orchestra's first gramophone set was made before its debut concert; with Sargent and the Royal Choral Society the LPO recorded choruses from ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' and ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' at [[Kingsway Hall]] in September 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road]] recording was in October, under Sir Henry Wood.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; Beecham's first discs with the orchestra were made in January 1933, with his ballet suite ''The Origin of Design'', arranged from music by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; From then until his last LPO recording in December 1945 Beecham recorded ninety-nine [[Gramophone record#78 rpm disc developments|78-rpm]] sets with the orchestra.&lt;ref name=disco&gt;Stuart, pp. 443–450&lt;/ref&gt; Other conductors who worked in the EMI studios with the orchestra in its early years included Elgar, [[Felix Weingartner]], [[John Barbirolli]], and [[Serge Koussevitzky]].&lt;ref name=s2&gt;Stuart, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Soloists in concerto recordings included the pianists [[Artur Schnabel]] and [[Alfred Cortot]] and the violinists [[Fritz Kreisler]] and [[Jascha Heifetz]].&lt;ref name=s2/&gt;

In 1946 the orchestra began recording for EMI's rival, Decca. The LPO's first recording for the label, Stravinsky's ''[[Petrushka]]'', conducted by [[Ernest Ansermet]], was followed by a large number of sessions as the company rebuilt its catalogue after the war.&lt;ref name=decca/&gt; Among those who recorded with the orchestra for Decca were van Beinum, Sargent, de Sabata, Furtwängler, [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]], [[Clemens Krauss]], [[Hans Knappertsbusch]], [[Erich Kleiber]] and the young Solti.&lt;ref name=decca&gt;Stuart, Philip. [http://www.charm.rhul.ac.uk/discography/decca.html ''Decca Classical, 1929–2009''], AHRC Research Centre for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music, retrieved 5 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The orchestra's first [[stereophonic]] recording was made for Decca in 1956, with Boult in Vaughan Williams's [[Symphony No. 8 (Vaughan Williams)|Eighth Symphony]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike its London rivals the RPO and the Philharmonia (both of whom recorded for many years only for EMI and its associates, with the rarest of exceptions), the post-war LPO was not exclusively associated with one company, and as well as Decca it recorded for Philips, [[Sony Classical Records|CBS]], [[RCA Red Seal Records|RCA]], [[Chandos Records|Chandos]] and many other labels.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; For some years in the 1950s and 1960s the orchestra was contracted to two companies at once, and consequently appeared under the name "the Philharmonic Promenade Orchestra" in some of its recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Simeone and Mundy, pp. 80–96&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s the orchestra was particularly associated with [[Lyrita]], an independent company specialising in neglected British repertoire.&lt;ref name=decca/&gt; In most LPO recordings for Lyrita the conductor was Boult; in the same period he also recorded extensively for EMI, with the LPO his preferred orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The LPO plays on many opera recordings, some taped live at Glyndebourne and the Festival Hall, and others in the studios of Decca and EMI. They range from early works  such as Cavalli's ''[[L'Ormindo]]'' (recorded 1968) and Glydebourne's staging of Handel's ''[[Theodora (Handel)|Theodora]]'' (1996) to central repertoire such as ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' (1974), ''[[Carmen]]'' (1975 and 2002) and ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg|Die Meistersinger]]'' (2011), and première recordings of 20th-century works including Vaughan Williams's ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress (opera)|The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' (1972), Shostakovich's ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk]]'' (1979) and  [[Péter Eötvös|Eötvös]]'s ''[[Love and Other Demons]]'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://glyndebourne.com/shop/cds-audio?page=all "CDs and audio"], Glyndebourne, retrieved 8 September 2014 (''Theodora'', ''Carmen'' (2002), ''Die Meistersinger'' and ''Love and Other Demons''); Stuart, Philip.

In a discography of the LPO published in 1997, Philip Stuart listed 280 recordings made at Kingsway Hall and 353 at Abbey Road.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 2000s the late 20th-century boom in classical recordings had ended, and with studio work in decline for all orchestras, the LPO set up its own CD label in 2005, featuring recordings taken mainly from live concerts. With the exception of Steinberg, all the orchestra's principal conductors from Beecham to Jurowski are represented in the label's releases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpo.org.uk/recordings/about-the-lpo-label.html "About the LPO Label"], London Philharmonic Orchestra, retrieved 5 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The orchestra lists among its best-selling recordings Mahler's [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Eighth Symphony]], conducted by Tennstedt, and works by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] with Jurowski.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpo.org.uk/recordings/bestsellers.html "Bestsellers"], London Philharmonic Orchestra, retrieved 5 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film scores and other non-classical recordings===

Although not rivalling the LSO's total of more than 200 film score recordings, the LPO has played for a number of soundtracks, starting in 1936 with ''[[Whom the Gods Love]]''. The orchestra played for ten films made during the Second World War, and then did little soundtrack work until the 1970s, with the major exception of ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962). Later scores have included those for ''[[Antony and Cleopatra (1972 film)|Antony and Cleopatra]]'' (1972), ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1973), ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'' (1986), ''[[Dead Ringers (film)|Dead Ringers]]'' (1988), ''[[In the Name of the Father (film)|In the Name of the Father]]'' (1993), the ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy (2001–03) and most of the music for the [[The Hobbit (film series)|three films]] derived from ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (2012–14).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpo.org.uk/recordings/film-highlights.html "Film highlights"], London Philharmonic Orchestra, retrieved 5 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The orchestra has made many non-classical recordings, including such titles as ''Hawaiian Paradise'' (1959), ''[[Evita (album)|Evita]]'' (1976), ''Broadway Gold'' (1978), ''Folk Music of the Region of Asturias'' (1984), ''Academy Award Themes'' (1984), ''Japanese Light Music'' (1993), ''The Symphonic Music of Pink Floyd'' (1994) and ''The Symphonic Music of The Who'' (1995).&lt;ref name=s443&gt;Stuart, p. 443–450&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 the orchestra recorded the 205 national anthems to be used at medal ceremonies at the [[2012 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] and [[2012 Summer Paralympics|Paralympic]] Games in London the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/news/london-2012-hands-baton-london-philharmonic-orchestra "London 2012 Hands Baton to London Philharmonic Orchestra"], IPC, 15 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lydia Emilie Florence Jannsen''', ({{OldStyleDate|24 December|1843|12 December}} – {{OldStyleDate|11 August|1886|30 July}}), known by her [[pen name]] '''Lydia Koidula''', was an [[Estonian literature|Estonian poet]]. Her [[sobriquet]] means 'Lydia of the Dawn' in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. It was given to her by the writer [[Carl Robert Jakobson]]. She is also frequently referred to as ''Koidulaulik'' – 'Singer of the Dawn'.

In Estonia, like elsewhere in Europe, writing was not considered a suitable career for a respectable young lady in the mid-nineteenth-century. Koidula's poetry and her newspaper work for her populist father, [[Johann Voldemar Jannsen]] (1819–1890) remained anonymous. In spite of this, she was a major literary figure, the founder of [[Estonian theatre]], and closely allied to [[Carl Robert Jakobson]] (1841–1882), the influential radical and [[Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald]] (1803–1882), writer of the Estonian national epic, ''[[Kalevipoeg]]'' (''The Son of Kalev'').

==Biography==
Lydia Jannsen was born in [[Vändra|Fennern]] (present-day Vändra),  [[Governorate of Livonia]], [[Russian Empire]]. The family moved to the nearby county town of [[Pärnu|Pernau]] (present-day Pärnu) in 1850 where, in 1857, her father started the first local [[Estonian language]] newspaper and where Lydia attended the German grammar school. The Jannsens moved to the university town of [[Tartu|Dorpat]] (present-day Tartu) in 1864. [[Nationalism]], including publication in indigenous languages, was a very touchy subject in the [[Russian Empire]] but the rule of the Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] (1855–1881) was relatively liberal and Jannsen managed to persuade the imperial censorship to allow him to publish the first national Estonian language newspaper in 1864.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/868958072|title=The Estonians : the long road to Independence|last=Gunter.|first=Faure,|date=2012|publisher=Lulu.com|others=Mensing, Teresa.|year=|isbn=1105530035|location=London|pages=145–146|oclc=868958072}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Pärnu local and the national newspaper were called ''[[Postimees]]'' (''The Courier''). Lydia wrote for her father on both papers besides publishing her own work. In 1873 she married Eduard Michelson, a Livonian army physician, and moved to [[Kronstadt]], the headquarters of the Russian navy near [[St. Petersburg]]. In 1876–78 the Michelsons visited [[Breslau]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Vienna]]. Koidula lived in Kronstadt for 13 years but despite spending her summers in Estonia, she never stopped feeling inconsolably homesick. Lydia Koidula was the mother of three children. She died from breast cancer on 11 August 1886. Her last poem was ''Enne surma- Eestimaale!'' (''Before Death, To Estonia!'').

==Works==
[[Image:Lydia Koidula portrait.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Lydia Koidula. Same image was used on an [[Estonian kroon|Estonian banknote]]]]

Koidula's most important work, ''Emajõe Ööbik'', (''The Nightingale of the [[Emajõgi]] [the Mother River]''), was published in 1867.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Three years earlier, in 1864, Adam Peterson, a farmer, and [[Johann Köler]], a fashionable Estonian portraitist living in Saint Petersburg, had petitioned the Emperor for better treatment from the German landlords who ruled the Baltics, equality and for the language of education to be Estonian. Immediately afterwards they were taken to the police where they were interrogated about a petition that 'included false information and was directed against the state'. Adam Peterson was sentenced to imprisonment for a year. Two years later, in 1866, the censorship reforms of 1855 that had given Koidula's father a window to start ''[[Postimees]]'' were reversed. Pre-publication censorship was re-imposed and literary freedom was curtailed. This was the political and literary climate when Koidula started to publish. Nevertheless, it was also the time of the national awakening when the Estonian people, freed from serfdom in 1816, were beginning to feel a sense of pride in nationhood and to aspire to self-determination. Koidula was the most articulate voice of these aspirations.

German influence in Koidula's work was unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.estonica.org/en/Culture/Literature/Baltic_German_literature_and_its_impact/|title=Estonica.org - Baltic German literature and its impact|website=www.estonica.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baltic Germans]] had retained hegemony in the region since the 13th century, throughout German, Polish, Swedish and Russian rule and thus German was the language of tuition and of the intelligentsia in 19th century Estonia. Like her father (and all other Estonian writers at the time) Koidula translated much sentimental German prose, poetry and drama and there is a particular influence of the [[Biedermeier]] movement. Biedermeier, a style which dominated 'bourgeois' art in continental Europe from 1815 to 1848, developed in the wake of the suppression of revolutionary ideas following the defeat of Napoleon. It was plain, unpretentious and characterised by pastoral romanticism; its themes were the home, the family, religion and scenes of rural life. The themes of Koidula's early ''Vainulilled'' (''Meadow Flowers''; 1866) were certainly proto-Biedermeier, but her delicate, melodic treatment of them was in no way rustic or unsophisticated, as demonstrated in the unrestrained patriotic outpourings of ''Emajõe Ööbik''. Koidula reacted to the historical subjugation of the Estonian people as to a personal affront; she spoke of slavery and the yoke of subordination as if from personal experience. By the time of the [[Estonian Age of Awakening|National Awakening in the 1860s]], Estonia had been ruled by foreign powers – Danish, German, Swedish, Polish and Russian – for over 600 years. In this context, she was conscious of her own role in the destiny of the nation.  She once wrote to a Finnish correspondent: "It is a sin, a great sin, to be little in great times when a person can actually make history".

The Estonian literary tradition started by Kreutzwald continued with Koidula but whereas ''The Bard of [[Virumaa|Viru]]'' tried to imitate the ''regivärss'' folk traditions of ancient Estonian, Koidula wrote (mostly) in modern, [[Western Europe]]an end-rhyming metres that had, by the mid 19th century, become the dominant form. This made Koidula's poetry much more accessible to the popular reader. But the major importance of Koidula lays not so much in her preferred form of verse but in her potent use of the Estonian language. Estonian was, still, in the 1860s, in a German dominated Baltic province of [[Imperial Russia]], the language of the oppressed indigenous peasantry. It was still the subject of orthographical bickering, still used in the main for predominantly patronising educationalist or religious texts, practical advice to farmers or cheap and cheerful popular story telling. Koidula successfully used the vernacular language to express emotions that ranged from an affectionate poem about the family cat, in ''Meie kass'' (''Our Cat'') and delicate love poetry, ''Head ööd'' (''Good Night'') to a powerful ''cri de coeur'' and rallying call to an oppressed nation, ''Mu isamaa nad olid matnud'' (''My Country, They Have Buried You''). With Lydia Koidula, the colonial view that the Estonian language was an underdeveloped instrument for communication was, for the first time, demonstrably contradicted.

Koidula is also considered the "founder of Estonian theatre" through her drama activities at the [[Vanemuine|Vanemuine Society]] (Estonian: ''Vanemuise Selts''), a society started by the Jannsens in [[Tartu]] in 1865 to promote Estonian culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kocur.uni.wroc.pl/ljubov-vassiljeva-the-origins-of-theatre-in-estonia/|title=Ljubov Vassiljeva, The Origins of Theatre in Estonia – Mirek Kocur|website=kocur.uni.wroc.pl|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lydia was the first to write original plays in Estonian and to address the practicalities of stage direction and production. Despite some Estonian interludes at the German theatre in [[Tallinn]], in the early 19th century, there had been no appreciation of theatre as a medium and few writers considered drama of any consequence, though Kreutzwald had translated two verse tragedies. In the late 1860s, both Estonians and Finns started to develop performances in their native tongues and Koidula, following suit, wrote and directed the comedy, ''Saaremaa Onupoeg'' (''The Cousin from [[Saaremaa]]'') in 1870 for the Vanemuine Society. It was based on [[Theodor Körner (author)|Theodor Körner]]'s (1791–1813) farce ''Der Vetter aus Bremen'', (''The Cousin from Bremen'') adapted to an Estonian situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/76786725|title=The new theatre of the Baltics : from Soviet to Western influence in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania|last=1954-|first=Johnson, Jeff,|date=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|year=|isbn=9780786429929|location=Jefferson, N.C.|pages=93|oclc=76786725}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vanemuine.ee/theatre-vanemuine/?lang=en|title=Theatre Vanemuine - Teater Vanemuine|work=Teater Vanemuine|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characterisation was rudimentary and the plot was simple but it was popular and Koidula went on to write and direct ''Maret ja Miina,'' (aka ''Kosjakased''; ''The Betrothal Birches'', 1870) and her own creation, the first ever completely Estonian play, ''Säärane mulk'' (''What a Bumpkin!''). Koidula's attitude to the theatre was influenced by the philosopher, dramatist, and critic [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (1729–1781), the author of ''Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts'' (''The Education of the Human Race''; 1780).  Her plays were didactic and a vehicle for popular education. Koidula's theatrical resources were few and raw – untrained, amateur actors and women played by men – but the qualities that impressed her contemporaries were a gallery of believable characters and cognizance of contemporary situations.

At the first [[Estonian Song Festival]], in 1869, an important rallying event of the Estonian clans, two poems were set to music with lyrics by Lydia Koidula: ''Sind Surmani'' (''Till Death'') and ''[[My Country is My Love|Mu isamaa on minu arm]]'' (''My Country is My Love''), which became the unofficial anthem during the [[Occupation of Baltic states|Soviet occupation]] when her father's ''[[Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm]]'' (''My Country is My Pride and Joy''), the anthem of the Estonian Republic between 1921 and 1940, was forbidden. Koidula's song always finished every festival, with or without permission. The tradition persists to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://enrs.eu/pl/articles/1576-revolution-by-song-choral-singing-and-political-change-in-estonia|title=Revolution by Song: Choral Singing and Political Change in Estonia|last=Jaworowska|first=Jagna|website=enrs.eu|language=pl-pl|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorial Museum of Lydia Koidula==
[[File:Lydia Koidula monument1.jpg|thumb|Monument to Lydia Koidula in [[Pärnu]] created by [[Amandus Adamson]].]]
A branch of the [[Pärnu]] Museum, the museum gives an overview of the life and work of poet Lydia Koidula and her father Johann Voldemar Jannsen (author of the lyrics of Estonian anthem), important figures in Estonian national awakening period in the 19th century.

The Koidula museum is located in the [[Pärnu Ülejõe Gümnaasium|Pärnu Ülejõe]] schoolhouse. The building was constructed in 1850 and has a unique interior. It was the home of Johann Voldemar Jannsen and the editorial office of the ''[[Postimees|Perno Postimees]]'' newspaper until 1863, now it is under protection as a historical monument. Jannsen's elder daughter, poet Lydia Koidula grew up in the house. It is the main task of the museum to keep alive the memory of Koidula and Jannsen and to introduce their life and work in the context of the period of national awakening in Estonia through the permanent exposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48486870|title=Estonia|last=1948-|first=Taylor, Neil,|date=2002|publisher=Bradt|year=|isbn=9781841620473|edition= 3rd|location=Chalfont St. Peter, England|pages=180|oclc=48486870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parnumuuseum.ee/koidula-museum|title=Koidula Museum|website=www.parnumuuseum.ee|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mont des Arts''' ([[French language|French]], {{IPA-fr|mɔ̃dɛzaʁ|pron}}) or '''Kunstberg''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]], {{IPA-nl|ˈkɵnzdbɛrx|pron|Nl-Kunstberg.ogg}}), meaning "hill/mount of the arts", is an urban complex and historic site in the centre of [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], including the [[Royal Library of Belgium]], the [[National Archives of Belgium]], the [[Square – Brussels Meeting Centre]], and a public garden.

This site is located between rue Montagne de la Cour/Hofbergstraat and the [[Coudenberg|Coundenberg]] in its 'upper' part, and Boulevard de l'Empereur/Keizerslaan and Place de l'Albertine/Albertinaplein in its 'lower' part. It is served by the [[Brussels Central Station]].

== History ==
The area of the Mont des Arts used to be a densely populated neighbourhood, the ''Quartier Saint Roches/Sint-Rochuswijk''. Between the 15th and the 18th century, the hill on which it was located was known as the ''Montagne de la Cour/Hofberg''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.montdesarts.com/en/History|title=Kunstberg - History|website=www.montdesarts.com|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] had the idea to convert the site into an arts' quarter and bought the whole neighbourhood. Various architects and urban planners were called upon to draw plans of the buildings which were to accommodate all kinds of cultural institutions. After the demolition of the old buildings, the site turned into an ugly urban void because the project lacked sufficient finance. To increase the area's appeal during the [[Brussels International 1910|Brussels International Exposition of 1910]], the king ordered the French landscape architect Pierre Vacherot to design a 'temporary' garden on the hill. It featured a park and a monumental staircase with cascading fountains descending the gentle slope from [[Place Royale (Brussels)|Place Royale]] down to Boulevard de l'Empereur/Keizerslaan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1910, a year after the death of Leopold II, the new park was inaugurated by [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert I]].
[[File:Albertine - 01.jpg|left|thumb|[[Royal Library of Belgium]]]]
[[File:Belgique - Bruxelles - Palais des Congrès - 01.jpg|thumb|[[Square – Brussels Meeting Centre|Congress Palace of Brussels]]]]
Although the garden was conceived as temporary, it became a well-appreciated green area in the heart of the capital, but when the plans for the Mont des Arts came back by the end of the 1930s, this park had to be demolished to create a new square as the centre of the urban renewal project. The project was entrusted jointly to architects Maurice Houyoux and Jules Ghobert. Between 1956 and 1958, the park and its surroundings gave way to massive, severe geometric structures such as the [[Royal Library of Belgium|Royal Royal Library of Belgium]] and the Congress Palace. The new geometric garden on the square was designed by landscape architect René Péchère.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The inauguration took place in 1969.

== Present day ==
The Mont des Arts offers one of Brussels' finest views. From the elevated vantage point, the famous tower of the [[Brussels Town Hall]] in the [[Grand Place]] is clearly visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://visit.brussels/en/place/Mont-des-Arts-Gardens|title=Mont des Arts Gardens|website=visit.brussels|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a sunny day, the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Belgium|Koekelberg Basilica]] and even the [[Atomium]] can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/belgium/articles/the-history-of-the-mont-des-arts-in-1-minute/|title=The History Of The Mont des Arts In 1 Minute|last=Poel|first=Nana Van De|work=Culture Trip|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4131">The '''Northumbrian Pipers' Society''' is a society, founded to promote both [[Types of bagpipes|types]] of [[Northumbrian]] bagpipes - the [[Northumbrian smallpipes]] and the half-long pipes, now generally known as the [[Border pipes]]. There had been several attempts to encourage the pipes and their music during the 19th century, but no society was formed with this specific aim until the [[Northumbrian Small Pipes Society]] in 1893. That society organised a series of competitions, in which [[Richard Mowat]] and [[Henry Clough]] were both prizewinners. However it was short-lived, dissolving around 1899. Today the society is divided into two branches, the main branch based in [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]], and the Cleveland branch based in [[Sedgefield]].

The Northumbrian Pipers' Society was founded in 1928 in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]], under the patronage of the Duke of Northumberland. The first President was G.V.B. Charlton, who had been active in encouraging the playing of the smallpipes, and particularly the revival of the half-long pipes. Its policy aim was to encourage and stimulate 'the younger generation of pipers and beginners in pipe playing'. [[Billy Pigg]], an influential piper, was a Vice-President from 1930, while [[Tom Clough]], known as the 'Prince of Pipers', accepted a Vice-Presidency in 1933. At first they met in each other's homes to exchange tunes and to organise the occasional dance. In 1937 they acquired a permanent home in the [[Morden Tower]] in Newcastle. The Society's regular meetings and annual competitions are currently held the Chantry Bagpipe Museum, in Morpeth. It also holds an annual concert in Morpeth. It publishes a quarterly newsletter and an annual magazine, as well as many important collections of pipe music, including, in 2000 'The Clough Family of Newsham',&lt;ref&gt;The Clough Family of Newsham, {{ISBN|0-902510-20-7}}, edited by Chris Ormston and Julia Say&lt;/ref&gt; a detailed study of the music of [[Tom Clough]] and his family, and, in 1997, 'The Border Minstrel',&lt;ref&gt;Billy Pigg, The Border Minstrel, Northumbrian Pipers' Society, 2nd edition, 2 vols., C. Ross and J. Say, {{ISBN|978-0-902510-30-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-902510-31-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which included all of [[Billy Pigg]]'s known compositions, and some other tunes from his repertoire. Other important recent tunebooks include a new edition of [[John Peacock (piper)|John Peacock]]'s early tunebook,&lt;ref&gt;Peacock's Tunes, 2nd ed., Northumbrian Pipers' Society (1999), {{ISBN|0-902510-19-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a book of [[James Hill (folk musician)|James Hill]]'s hornpipes and other tunes, adapted for the smallpipes,&lt;ref&gt;The Fiddle Music of James Hill, ({{ISBN|0-902510-27-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; and a tunebook and tutor for the [[Border pipes]]. They also published an important book on pipemaking, by [[William Alfred Cocks]] and [[Jim Bryan (piper)|Jim F. Bryan]], 'The Northumbrian Bagpipes', in 1967.

The relative popularity of the instrument today, compared to the small numbers of players in the early 20th century, the wider availability of well-made instruments, and the availability in print of much of the instrument's traditional repertoire, can all be ascribed, directly or indirectly, to the work of the Society.

The Society converted to charitable status on 1 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northumbrianpipers.org.uk/index.php?page=the-northumbrian-pipers-society&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paracas textiles''' were found at a [[necropolis]] in [[Peru]] in the 1920s. The necropolis held 420 bodies who had been [[mummified]] and wrapped in embroidered textiles in 200–300 BCE&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; The examples in the [[British Museum]] show flying [[shaman]]s who hold severed heads by their hair.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt;

==Description==
These textiles were made by South American people over a thousand years before the rise of the [[Inca]]. They are brightly coloured and show evidence of both a design and a style.  The subject of these images are supernatural creatures or shamans who use their hands to hold severed human heads whilst their wings transport them like birds.&lt;ref name="Proulx"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Proulx|first=Donald A.|title=A Sourcebook of Nasca Ceramic Iconography: Reading a culture through its art|publisher=University of Iowa Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-87745-979-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjBJSTyvRywC|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; These could be intended to represent being carried to the next world by spirits or that these figures represent the spirits themselves.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/p/paracas_textile.aspx Paracas textile], British Museum, accessed 27 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The people who created these textiles had a complex society. There is evidence of pottery, fishing, and farming. There were craftspeople who could make knives from obsidian, jewellery from gold&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; as well as understanding all the complexities of weaving.&lt;ref name="feltham"&gt;{{cite book|last=Feltham|first=Jane|title=Peruvian Textiles |pages= 46–7|year=1989|publisher=Shire Ethnography|isbn=0-7478-0014-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The textiles were made from wool and cotton. The wool is thought to have come from [[Alpaca fiber|Alpaca]] or [[Llama]].&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; They had been dyed with [[natural dye]]s which unusually had kept their colour after over 2,000 years. The preservation of the colours is attributed to the dry conditions combined with the lack of damage which would usually have been caused by sunlight.&lt;ref name="ahotw"/&gt;

The smaller fragments illustrated here have been taken from the large pieces of cloth&lt;ref name="ahotw"/&gt; that were used to wrap the bodies of the dead. These cloths were as long as 100 feet (34 metres) and would have required a significant organisation of a number of people to construct. The bodies were found in groups of 40 or 50 as if they were family vaults which had been used by several generations.

One of the unusual qualities of the skulls that were found is that many of them had been distorted in unusual ways. This distortion is achieved by attaching boards and weights to the skull as it grows. Other distortions are due to the process of [[trepanning]] which as where holes were drilled into the skulls of living people. Inspection shows that these holes had healed and shows that the patients did not die when this process was applied. Museums in Peru like the [[Ica, Peru|Museo Regional de Ica]] display both these skulls and the textiles that were found around them.&lt;ref name="Schlecht"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlecht|first=Neil E.|title=Frommer's Peru |year=2010|page=154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bbB_BBi751MC&amp;pg=PA154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The necropolis was discovered by [[Julio C. Tello]] in the 1920s. Tello first visited the site on July 26, 1925 following a trail that had begun in 1915 when he had purchased ancient textiles in [[Pisco, Peru]].&lt;ref name="burger"/&gt; On 25 October 1927, Tello and his team uncovered the first of hundreds of ceremonial mummified bundle burials. Tello discovered a necropolis that contained corpses that were sat in baskets. Around each of the bodies were large textiles that included large woven cotton that was decorated with woollen embroidery.

A {{ill|Museo Julio C. Tello|lt=purpose built museum|es}} was built near [[Paracas (municipality)|Paracas]] at the request of [[Óscar R. Benavides|President Benevides]] who in August 1938 authorised Tello to build a museum to house the 380 textiles that Tello and his staff had preserved. They were able to put on display over 180 textiles. The preservation of these had been funded by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref name="burger"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burger|first=Richard L.|title=The life and writings of Julio C. Tello: America's first indigenous archaeologist|pages=28, 38|year=2009|publisher=University of Iowa Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75xVOiyWo4gC&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The embroidery illustrated here are fragments from a larger piece of fabric that were removed before they were purchased by the British Museum.

The '''''Pesaro Madonna''''' ({{lang-it|Pala Pesaro}}) (better known as the Madonna di Ca' Pesaro) is a painting by the late Italian Renaissance master [[Titian]], commissioned by Jacopo Pesaro, whose family acquired in 1518 the chapel in the [[Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari|Frari]] Basilica in [[Venice]] for which the work was painted, and where it remains today.  Jacopo was Bishop of [[Paphos]], in [[Cyprus]], and had been named commander of the papal fleet by the [[Borgia]] pope, [[Alexander VI]].&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt; This painting recalls one of Titian's earliest paintings ''[[Jacopo Pesaro being presented by Pope Alexander VI to Saint Peter]]'', c. 1510-11&lt;ref name="smart1"&gt;{{cite web | title =Titian's Madonna of the Pesaro Family | work = | publisher =[[Smarthistory]] at [[Khan Academy]] | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/titian-madonna-of-the-pesaro-family.html | accessdate =March 11, 2013 }}, text.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==
Titian shows his patron in a devotional pose, kneeling before the Virgin and presented to her by [[Saint Peter]].  Prominently displayed on the step is Saint Peter's key; its diagonal plane, leading toward the Virgin, parallels that of Jacopo.  The Virgin's position at the top of the steps alludes to her celestial role as ''Madonna della Scala ''(Madonna of the Stairs) and as the Stairway to Heaven. Titian actually used his wife, who died in childbirth soon after, as the model for the Virgin Mary in this work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-destinations.com/italy/venice-santa-maria-gloriosa-dei-frari Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice], accessed March 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The large red banner at the far left prominently displays the papal arms in the center and those of Jacopo below. Also displayed is a laurel branch, a symbol of victory.  An unidentified knight has two prisoners in tow, a turbaned [[Turkish people|Turk]] and a [[Moors|Moor]], probably a reference to Jacopo's victory over the Turks in 1502.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;  At the right, [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] links the five kneeling Pesaro family members to Christ, suggesting that through his own route of identification with Christ salvation can be achieved.  Just behind Saint Francis is [[Saint Anthony of Padua]] - both, like [[Saint Bernardino]], are Franciscans, as is the church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari.

The members of the donor's family are motionless.  All the other figures gesture energetically and occupy diagonal planes.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;  The steps, surmounted by large columns cut off at the top, are thrust diagonally back into space.  Infant angels appear on the cloud above.  One seen in rear view holds the Cross.  The back of this angel is juxtaposed with the infant Christ, who turns playfully on Mary's lap and looks down at Saint Francis, who returns his gaze.  The fabrics are characteristically rich and textured, particularly the flag and costumes.  This attention to material textures is further enhanced by the variation of bright lights and dark accents in the sky.  The light of Venice, sparkling in its waterways, seems to illuminate this painting.

When Titian painted this [[altarpiece]], he broke with a centuries-long tradition of placing the devotional figures (the Virgin and Child) in the center of the painting and the painted space. By doing this, he allowed for a greater sense of movement through the painting, presaging the Baroque period's more complicated compositional techniques.
The painting is particularly innovative and shows an example of developed High-Renaissance style, as Titian has used diagonal and triangular principles to draw the viewer's eye up to the Madonna and Child, thus creating hierarchy within the work and shows that the Pesaro family are pious.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt; 

The architectural setting, involving the two large columns (which have been cropped to fit the altarpiece) draw emphasis vertically and to the height of the work; which draws the eye Heavenwards. These columns in the center of the painting are unprecedented in Renaissance painting, and are the subject of some controversy. X-rays reveal that Titian painted several other architectural elements in their place before settling on the columns.  Some critics have even speculated that Titian did not paint the columns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://venice.umwblogs.org/exhibit/titians-altarpieces-color-innovation-and-invention/assumption/ Titian: Madonna di Ca’ Pesaro], Venice an online exhibit, the University of Mary Washington. Accessed March 11, 2013 &lt;/ref&gt;  The outdoors setting suggests that the activity is taking place in a portico, in which the grandeur of the columns somehow belittles the human beings which leave the figures and the viewer almost in awe of the greater implied force.

[[File:The Great Cyrus &amp; Kasandan in the Castle of Apadana Persian Tableau Rug.JPG|thumb|A pictorial carpet of [[Cyrus the Great]] and [[Cassandane]] in [[Persepolis#Apadana_Palace|Apadana Palace]]]]
A '''pictorial carpet''', '''picture carpet''', '''tableau rug''', '''carpet tableau''' or '''rug tableau''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: تابلو فرش) is an ornamental [[Carpet|rug]] specially prepared for hanging on room and hall walls for decoration. The designs and samples on pictorial carpets are completely different from those on common floor rugs. Pictorial carpets are generally made of [[silk]] but they have also been made from [[wool]]. Pictorial carpets are usually framed to sell and use.

== Description ==
{{Original research section|date=January 2016}}
{{confusing section|small=no|reason=some of this section isn't written well and it is unclear in some places what is being asserted|date=March 2016}}
The very concept and expectations of [[Persian rugs]] slowly started to change over the past 25 years. The original tableau rug, also known as pictorial carpet is not known when it was weaved together but some of the old rugs back in 19th &amp; 20th century show that the similar type design were used such as hunting scene in Isfahan or Qum carpet as well as floral design in Isfahan and Tabriz carpet.

Also picturesque scenes from ancient Persia showing the king and his wife is another example. After the 1979 revolution in Iran, the whole industry started to change and many of the original patterns which were famous in Iran were exported to many countries which they have started producing similar products with much lower quality such as China, Turkish, Afghanistan, India etc. and unfortunately selling them in the global market known as Persian design carpets. This have hurt the industry significantly which the export of the Persian rugs has been reducing year by year after the revolution. At the same time a new trend slowly started to take shape as part of the Persian rug culture and Iranian came to a conclusion since they are best known carpet weaver and the oldest known carpet maker in the world &amp; modern society, why not to re-produce some of the most famous, well known and rare art works from across the globe in the new product known as “tableau rug”. What is known is that now this is a new trend in the ancient world of Persian rug.

Pictorial carpets are being woven exactly the same way as the Persian rug has been made over the past 2500 years so there is no different in quality. The main different is that in pictorial carpet, there is not the ancient design and it always has a picture or scenery that are much more colorful with many different scenes. They can be framed the same way as an art work or painting and they are designed to be hung on the wall.

==Overview==
On 21 February 2012, five members of the group staged a performance on the [[soleas]] of [[Moscow]]'s [[Cathedral of Christ the Savior]].&lt;ref name=origvideo&gt;{{cite video | date = 2 July 2012 | title = Pussy Riot gig at Christ the Savior Cathedral (original video) | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grEBLskpDWQ | accessdate=2 July 2013 | archivedate=2 November 2012 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BsOwD5mn |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their actions were stopped by church security officials.

On 3 March, two of the group members, [[Nadezhda Tolokonnikova]] and [[Maria Alyokhina]], were arrested and charged with [[Hooliganism#Modern use|hooliganism]]. A third member, [[Yekaterina Samutsevich]], was arrested on 16 March. Denied bail, they were held in custody until their trial began in late July. On 17 August, the three members were convicted of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred, and each was sentenced to two years imprisonment.&lt;ref name="rt-1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rt.com/news/pussy-riot-trial-896/ |title=Pussy Riot sentenced to two years in jail |work=[[RT (TV Network)|RT]] |date=17 August 2012|accessdate=27 October 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BiyjPxR0|archivedate=27 October 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19297373 |title=Pussy Riot found guilty of hooliganism by Moscow court|date=17 August 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 July 2013|archivedate=27 October 2012 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Biym2Ba4 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-sentenced-prison-putin?newsfeed=true |title=Pussy Riot sentenced to two years in prison colony over anti-Putin protest |author=Miriam Elder |work=The Guardian |date=17 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BiyqdDT4|archivedate=27 October 2012|deadurl=no |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other members of the group, who escaped arrest after February's protest, reportedly left Russia fearing prosecution.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} On 10 October, following an appeal, Samutsevich was freed on probation, her sentence suspended.

The trial and sentence attracted considerable criticism,&lt;ref&gt;According to BBC Monitoring, in the worldwide press there was 'almost universal condemnation' of the two-year sentence imposed on the three members of the group. {{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19307077 |title=Press aghast at Pussy Riot verdict |date=18 August 2012 |publisher=BBC News |archivedate=2 July 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BizIbsJs |accessdate=2 July 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the West. The case was adopted by human rights groups including [[Amnesty International]], which designated the women [[prisoners of conscience]], and by a wide range of musicians including [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], and [[Yoko Ono]]. Public opinion in Russia was generally less sympathetic towards the women.&lt;ref name=Levada1&gt;{{cite web|title=Россияне о деле Pussy Riot ("Russians on the Pussy Riot case")|url=http://www.levada.ru/31-07-2012/rossiyane-o-dele-pussy-riot|publisher=Levada|language=Russian|date=31 July 2012|archivedate=2 July 2013|accessdate=2 July 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BizWdRy3|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Levada2&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.levada.ru/17-08-2012/tret-rossiyan-verit-v-chestnyi-sud-nad-pussy-riot |title=Треть россиян верит в честный суд над Pussy Riot ("One-third of Russians believe in fairness of Pussy Riot trial") |date=17 August 2012 |publisher=Levada|language=Russian|accessdate=2 July 2013|archivedate=17 August 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bizews66|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putin stated that the band had "undermined the moral foundations" of the nation and "got what they asked for".&lt;ref name=InterfaxReligion&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=9971 |title=Putin deems fair Pussy Riot sentence |work=Interfax Religion |date=8 October 2012|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Raising the Flag on the Three-Country Cairn'''''{{refn|Colonel Oinonen originally titled the picture as "[a] scene at the three-country boundary stone on 27 April 1945" ({{lang-fi|Kohtaus kolmen valtakunnan rajakivellä 27.4.1945}}; original photograph scan received from the Military Museum of Finland), but it is usually labelled as "Finnish soldiers raising the flag on the three-country cairn" ({{lang-fi|Suomalaissotilaat nostavat lipun kolmen valtakunnan rajapyykille}}) or a similar variation.&lt;ref name="Yle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESS"/&gt;|group="Note"}} is a historic photograph taken on 27 April 1945, which was the last day of the [[Military history of Finland during World War II|Second World War in Finland]]. It depicts a [[Finnish Army]] patrol of Battle Group Loimu, Infantry Regiment 1 ({{Lang-fi|taisteluosasto Loimu, jalkaväkirykmentti 1}}), raising the [[Flag of Finland|Finnish flag]] on the [[Three-Country Cairn|three-country cairn]] between [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], and [[Finland]] to celebrate the last German troops withdrawing from Finland. The photograph was taken by the commander of Infantry Regiment 1, Colonel [[Väinö Oinonen]] (alternatively V.J. Oinonen). It became a widely circulated symbol of World War II in Finland.

== Background ==
[[File:Flag_at_Kilpisjärvi_1945.jpg|left|thumb|
The small Finnish flag raised first on the cairn on 26 April 1945
]]
Amidst World War II, Finland fought both the [[Winter War]] of 1939–1940 and [[Continuation War]] of 1941–1944 against the Soviet Union. During the latter, Finland cooperated with [[Nazi Germany]], which had the 200,000-strong [[20th Mountain Army (Wehrmacht)|20th Mountain Army]] led by {{Lang|de|Generaloberst}} [[Lothar Rendulic]] stationed in [[Finnish Lapland]]. On September 1944, Finland agreed to a separate peace with the Soviet Union; a peace which required that Finland disarm or expel any German soldiers from Finland. The demand led to the [[Lapland War]]; the 20th Mountain Army started withdrawing north towards [[German occupation of Norway|occupied Norway]] with the [[Finnish Army]]'s [[Finnish III Corps (Continuation War)|III Corps]], led by General [[Hjalmar Siilasvuo]], in pursuit. By November, the war came to an effective end when most German units had withdrawn to Norway and the [[Lyngen]] Line—although some entrenched German forces still remained in Finland at [[Kilpisjärvi]] in the corridor leading to the border tripoint between Norway, Sweden, and Finland.{{refn|The corridor is nationally called Arm's Lapland ({{lang-fi|Käsivarren Lappi}}) or the Finnish Arm ({{lang-sv|Finska armen}}).|group="Note"}}{{sfn|Jowett|Snodgrass|2012}}{{sfn|Nenye|Munter|Wirtanen|Birks|2016|loc=Chpt. 3}}

On 25 April 1945, after it was determined that the final German formations in Finnish territory were withdrawing, a 60-strong battle patrol led by Captain Valkonen was assigned to recon if Finnish Lapland was free from ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' forces. The detachment was assembled from 1st Company, Battle Group Loimu, Infantry Regiment 1, and departed on its mission at 13.00 pm the same day from southern Kilpisjärvi. The ski patrol advanced north-west towards Norway for around {{Convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} until it was split in two near the [[Saana]] fell. The smaller group would approach the Norwegian border along the road while the bulk of the patrol would continue with Captain Valkonen towards the three-country cairn farther off. They reached the cairn by 1:15 am on 26 April after skiing approximately {{Convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} more. [[Pioneer (military)|Pioneer]] Antti Poikola attached a small [[flag of Finland]] to the cairn and the patrol reported back by radio that no Germans had been sighted on Finnish soil. Valkonen and his team shot three gun salutes at the cairn before leaving; the shots rang out across the [[fell]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and startled a Swedish border guard unit nearby.{{sfn|Kulju|2017|loc=Chpt. 4}}{{sfn|Oilinki|1998|loc=Chpt. Kun Poikolan Antti lopetti Lapin sodan}}

Around the noon of 26 April, commander of the battalion, Major Martti Santavuori and a mixed Finnish–Swedish patrol arrived at the tripoint. A German {{Lang|de|Gebirgsjäger}} unit approached them from Norway, and, with knowledge that they would not engage the Swedes, Major Santavuori signaled the German leader to meet up at the border. An Austrian {{Lang|de|Feldwebel}} soon skied closer and they discussed the war, both past and future. Major Santavuori and the {{Lang|de|Feldwebel}} saluted, shook hands and bid each other "as good a future as fate has to offer" before parting ways.{{sfn|Kulju|2017|loc=Chpt. 4}}

== Flag-raising ==
{{Location map|Scandinavia|width=|float=right|caption=Location of the tripoint depicted in the photograph in Northern Europe|label=|marksize=10|lat_deg=69.059972|lon_deg=20.548639}}On 27 April, commander of Infantry Regiment 1, Colonel [[Väinö Oinonen]] (alternatively V.J. Oinonen), arrived at the cairn to inspect the situation with a detachment of soldiers including photography specialists, a larger flag, and a better flagpole. The war flag of Finland was ceremoniously raised on the cairn and Colonel Oinonen took the titular photo—with the {{convert|894|m|ft|abbr=on}}-high Golddabakti fell of Norway in the background.{{sfn|Kulju|2017|loc=Chpt. 4}}{{sfn|Oilinki|1998|loc=Chpt. Kun Poikolan Antti lopetti Lapin sodan}} Amidst the festivities, a shout of "{{Lang|de|Wer da}}?!" surprised the Finnish soldiers. Even though the area had been inspected, a German unit lay waiting in position on the Norwegian side of the border. The flag-raising soldiers took cover behind the cairn. Battle was avoided after a Swedish officer approached to act as an intermediary. Soon after, Colonel Oinonen resolved the situation with two {{Lang|de|Oberleutnante}}, who shared German Juno cigarettes with him. The officers saluted each other and went their ways; the time was 13:30 pm. On 28 April, General Siilasvuo sent a telegram to Finnish Commander-in-Chief [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|C.G.E. Mannerheim]], reporting that the {{Lang|de|Wehrmacht}} had been expelled from Northern Finland.{{sfn|Kulju|2017|loc=Chpt. 4}}

== Aftermath ==

The picture became widely circulated in Finland and was an example of an iconic [[War photography|war photograph]] in Finnish World War II history. It was compared to similar pictures, such as the American ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]'' and the Soviet ''[[Raising a Flag over the Reichstag]]'', although it was not considered to have become as symbolic as they were. In fact, the Finnish popular memory of the conflict relied equally on fictional pictures, such as the cover of ''[[The Unknown Soldier (novel)|The Unknown Soldier]]'', a 1954 war novel about the [[Continuation War]].&lt;ref name="Yle"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9927243|title=Sotilaiden omat kamerat taltioivat Suomen sodista todellisuuden, joka ei kelvannut virallisiin kuviin – tutkija: "Hyvin rajua huumoria"|last=Mäntymäki|first=Varpu|date=2017-11-19|website=Yle Uutiset|language=fi|trans-title=Soldiers' own cameras captured the reality of Finland's wars, which wasn't approved for official photographs – researcher: "Very rough humour"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119092018/https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9927243|archivedate=19 November 2017|deadurl=no|access-date=2018-02-28|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IS"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.is.fi/kotimaa/art-2000000916473.html|title=Tämä ikoninen sotakuva on kuin suomalainen versio Iwo Jiman lipun pystytyksestä|last=Juuti|first=Mikko|date=2015-04-27|work=Ilta-Sanomat|access-date=2018-02-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302150051/https://www.is.fi/kotimaa/art-2000000916473.html|archive-date=2 March 2018|dead-url=no|language=fi-FI|trans-title=This iconic war photograph is like the Finnish version of raising the flag on Iwo Jima|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SK"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindstendt|first=Risto|last2=Kleemola|first2=Olli|date=2011-12-02|title=Tuntematon ikoni|trans-title=Unknown icon|url=|deadurl=no|journal=[[Suomen Kuvalehti]]|language=fi|volume=|issue=48|pages=48–57|archiveurl=|archivedate=2 March 2018|access-date=|via=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESS"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ess.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/art2364591|title=Lasten ristiretki päätti Suomen sotatien Lapissa 27. huhtikuuta 1945|last=Vainonen|first=Joel M.|date=2017-04-27|work=Etelä-Suomen Sanomat|access-date=2018-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504222749/http://www.ess.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/art2364591|archive-date=4 May 2017|dead-url=no|language=fi-FI|trans-title=The children's crusade concluded the Finnish war effort in Lapland on 27 April 1945|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Oilinki|1998|loc=Chpt.

'''Robert Penn Warren''' (April 24, 1905 – September 15, 1989) was an American poet, [[novelist]], and literary critic and was one of the founders of [[New Criticism]]. He was also a charter member of the [[Fellowship of Southern Writers]]. He founded the literary journal ''[[The Southern Review]]'' with [[Cleanth Brooks]] in 1935. He received the 1947 [[Pulitzer Prize for the Novel]] for his novel ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1946) and the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in 1958 and 1979. He is the only person to have won Pulitzer Prizes for both fiction and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Randy F. ''The Almanac of American Letters''. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 27. {{ISBN|0-86576-008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Warren was born in [[Guthrie, Kentucky]], very near the [[Tennessee]]-[[Kentucky]] border, to Robert Warren and Anna Penn.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 291. {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warren's mother's family had roots in Virginia, having given their name to the community of Penn's Store in [[Patrick County, Virginia]], and was a descendant of Revolutionary War soldier Colonel [[Abram Penn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freestateofpatrick.com/pcpeople.htm Patrick County People, Free State of Patrick] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711040008/http://www.freestateofpatrick.com/pcpeople.htm |date=2011-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Penn Warren graduated from Clarksville High School in [[Clarksville, Tennessee]], [[Vanderbilt University]] ([[Latin honors|''summa cum laude'']], [[Phi Beta Kappa]]) in 1925 and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (M.A.) in 1926. Warren pursued further graduate study at [[Yale University]] from 1927 to 1928 and obtained his [[B.Litt.]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] from [[New College, Oxford]], in England in 1930. He also received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] to study in Italy during the rule of [[Benito Mussolini]]. That same year he began his teaching career at Southwestern College (now [[Rhodes College]]) in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

==Career==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:RobertPennWarren.png|thumb|Robert Penn Warren commemorative stamp|{{FFDC|1=RobertPennWarren.png|log=2009 June 10|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;
While still an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University, Warren became associated with the group of poets there known as the [[Fugitives (poets)|Fugitives]], and somewhat later, during the early 1930s, Warren and some of the same writers formed a group known as the [[Southern Agrarians]]. He contributed "The Briar Patch" to the [[Agrarianism|Agrarian]] manifesto ''[[I'll Take My Stand]]'' along with 11 other Southern writers and poets (including fellow Vanderbilt poet/critics [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Allen Tate]], and [[Donald Davidson (poet)|Donald Davidson]]). In "The Briar Patch" the young Warren defends racial segregation, in line with  the political leanings of the Agrarian group, although Davidson deemed Warren's stances in the essay so progressive that he argued for excluding it from the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Edwin Thomas. "On Native Soil: A Visit with Robert Penn Warren," ''Mississippi Quarterly'' 38 (Winter 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Warren recanted these views in an article on the [[civil rights movement]], "Divided South Searches Its Soul", which appeared in the July 9, 1956 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. A month later, Warren published an expanded version of the article as a small book titled ''Segregation: The Inner Conflict in the South''.&lt;ref&gt;Metress, Christopher. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3549/is_n1_v32/ai_n28666757/ "Fighting battles one by one: Robert Penn Warren's ''Segregation''"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Southern Review'', Winter 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  He subsequently adopted a high profile as a supporter of [[racial integration]]. In 1965, he published ''[[Who Speaks for the Negro?]]'', a collection of interviews with black civil rights leaders including [[Malcolm X]] and [[Martin Luther King]], thus further distinguishing his political leanings from the more conservative philosophies associated with fellow Agrarians such as Tate, [[Cleanth Brooks]], and particularly Davidson. Warren's interviews with civil rights leaders are at the [[Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History]] at the University of Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uky.edu/libraries/nunncenter Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Warren's best-known work is ''[[All the King's Men]]'', a novel that won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1947. Main character [[Willie Stark (character)|Willie Stark]] resembles [[Huey Pierce Long]] (1893–1935), the radical [[Populism|populist]] governor of [[Louisiana]] whom Warren was able to observe closely while teaching at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]] from 1933 to 1942. ''All the King's Men'' became a highly successful film, starring [[Broderick Crawford]] and winning the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] in 1949. A 2006 film adaptation by writer/director [[Steven Zaillian]] featured [[Sean Penn]] as Willie Stark and [[Jude Law]] as Jack Burden. The opera ''[[Willie Stark]]'' by [[Carlisle Floyd]] to his own libretto based on the novel was first performed in 1981.

Warren served as the [[Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]], 1944–1945 (later termed [[Poet Laureate]]), and won two Pulitzer Prizes in poetry, in 1958 for ''Promises: Poems 1954–1956'' and in 1979 for ''Now and Then''. ''Promises'' also won the annual [[National Book Award for Poetry]].&lt;ref name=nba1958&gt;

In 1974, the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] selected him for the [[Jefferson Lecture]], the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the [[humanities]]. Warren's lecture was entitled "Poetry and Democracy" (subsequently published under the title ''Democracy and Poetry'').&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lectures].

Harvard University Press. Retrieved September 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1977, Warren was awarded the [[St. Louis Literary Award]] from the [[Saint Louis University]] Library Associates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slu.edu/libraries/associates/award.html Website of St. Louis Literary Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |title=Recipients of the St. Louis Literary Award |work= |author=Saint Louis University Library Associates |date= |accessdate=July 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731082313/http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |archive-date=July 31, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Warren was presented with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Jimmy Carter]]. In 1981, Warren was selected as a [[MacArthur Fellow]] and later was named as the first U.S. [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry]] on February 26, 1986. In 1987, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#87 Lifetime Honors - National Medal of Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721054307/http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warren was co-author, with [[Cleanth Brooks]], of ''[[Understanding Poetry]]'', an influential literature textbook. It was followed by other similarly co-authored textbooks, including  ''Understanding Fiction'', which was praised by [[Southern Gothic]] and Roman Catholic writer [[Flannery O'Connor]], and ''Modern Rhetoric'', which adopted what can be called a [[New Critical]] perspective.

==Personal life==
His first marriage was to Emma Brescia. His second marriage was in 1952 to [[Eleanor Clark]], with whom he had two children, [[Rosanna Warren|Rosanna Phelps Warren]] (born 1953) and Gabriel Penn Warren (born 1955). During his tenure at Louisiana State University he resided at Twin Oaks (otherwise known as the [[Robert Penn Warren House]]) in Prairieville, Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crt.state.la.us/hp/nationalregister/nhl/parish03/scans/03018001.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019140957/http://www.crt.state.la.us/hp/nationalregister/nhl/parish03/scans/03018001.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived the latter part of his life in [[Fairfield, Connecticut]], and [[Stratton, Vermont]] where he died of complications from prostate cancer. He is buried at Stratton, Vermont, and, at his request, a memorial marker is situated in the Warren family gravesite in Guthrie, Kentucky.

==Legacy==
In April 2005, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued a commemorative stamp to mark the 100th anniversary of Warren's birth. Introduced at the post office in his native Guthrie, it depicts the author as he appeared in a 1948 photograph, with a background scene of a political rally designed to evoke the setting of ''All the King's Men''. His son and daughter, Gabriel and [[Rosanna Warren]], were in attendance.

Vanderbilt University houses the [[Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities]], which is sponsored by the College of Arts and Science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/rpw_center/ Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; It began its programs in January 1988, and in 1989 received a $480,000 Challenge Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The center promotes "interdisciplinary research and study in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences."

The high school that Robert Penn Warren attended, Clarksville High School (Tennessee), was renovated into an apartment complex in 1982. The original name of the apartments was changed to The Penn Warren in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Penn Warren - History|url=http://thepennwarren.com/history/|website=ThePennWarren.com|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruth Lydia Saw''' (1 August 1901 –  23 March 1986) was a British [[philosopher]] and [[aestheticist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osborne|first=Harold|title=PROFESSOR RUTH L. SAW|journal=British Journal of Aesthetics|year=1986|volume=26|issue=4|pages=307–308|url=http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/4/307.extract|accessdate=19 February 2012|doi=10.1093/bjaesthetics/26.4.307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Ruth Saw attended the County School for Girls in Wallington, Surrey, followed in 1926 by [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]], [[University of London]], where she studied under [[Susan Stebbing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=S|title=Dictionary of Twentieth Century Philosophers|date=2005|publisher=Thoemmes|isbn=184371096X|page=925}}&lt;/ref&gt; She accepted a position as lecturer in Philosophy at [[Smith College]] and remained there for several years. She then returned to England and was appointed to a Lecturership in Philosophy at Bedford College in 1939 and remained there for the rest of her career. She became Reader in Philosophy in 1946 and then Professor of Aesthetics from 1961–64. She was also Head of Department there from 1953 until her retirement in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waithe|first1=Mary Ellen|title=A History of Women Philosophers|date=1995|publisher=Kluwer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=0792328086|pages=357–362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saw's philosophical interests began with logic and philosophy of language, particularly on causal induction in [[William of Ockham|Ockham]]'s work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saw|first1=Ruth L.|title=William of Ockham on Terms, Propositions, Meaning|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society|date=1941|volume=42|pages=45–64|jstor=4544363}}&lt;/ref&gt; This moved towards metaphysics, particularly Leibniz and Spinoza on whom she wrote full-length works. By the 1950s her interests lay with aesthetics. She was appointed Professor of Aesthetics in the 1961 and published three articles on the subject in the early 1960s.

Saw was a founding member of the [[British Society of Aesthetics]].

[[File:Rangoli.jpg|thumb|''[[Rangoli]]'', a popular form of [[Indian art|Indian Sand Paintings]], in [[Singapore]].]]
'''Sandpainting''' is the art of pouring coloured sands, and powdered pigments from minerals or crystals, or pigments from other natural or synthetic sources onto a surface to make a fixed, or unfixed sand painting. Unfixed sand paintings have a long established cultural history in numerous social groupings around the globe, and are often temporary, ritual paintings prepared for religious or healing ceremonies.  It is also referred to as drypainting.

Drypainting is practised by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the Southwestern United States, by [[Tibet]]an and Buddhist monks, as well as [[Australian Aborigines]], and also by Latin Americans on certain Christian holy days.

==History==

=== Native American sandpainting ===
[[File:Navajo sandpainting.jpg|thumb|Navajo sandpainting, photogravure by [[Edward S. Curtis]], 1907, Library of Congress]]

In the sandpainting of southwestern Native Americans (the most famous of which are the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] (known as the Diné)), the [[Medicine Man]] (or ''Hatałii'') paints loosely upon the ground of a [[hogan]], where the ceremony takes place, or on a [[buckskin (leather)|buckskin]] or cloth tarpaulin, by letting the coloured [[sand]]s flow through his fingers with control and skill. There are 600 to 1,000 different traditional designs for sandpaintings known to the Navajo. They do not view the paintings as static objects, but as spiritual, living beings to be treated with great respect. More than 30 different sandpaintings may be associated with one ceremony.

The colours for the painting are usually accomplished with naturally coloured sand, crushed [[gypsum]] (white), yellow [[ochre]], red [[sandstone]], [[charcoal]] and a mixture of charcoal and gypsum (blue). Brown can be made by mixing red and black; red and white make pink. Other colouring agents include corn meal, flower [[pollen]], or powdered roots and bark.

The paintings are for [[healing]] purposes only. Many of them contain images of ''[[Yeii|Yeibicheii]]'' (the Holy People). While creating the painting, the medicine man will [[chant]], asking the ''yeibicheii'' to come into the painting and help heal the patient.

When the medicine man finishes painting, he checks its accuracy. The order and [[symmetry]] of the painting symbolise the harmony which a patient wishes to reestablish in his or her life. The accuracy of a sandpainting is believed to determine its efficacy as a sacred tool. The patient will be asked to sit on the sandpainting as the medicine man proceeds with the healing chant. It is claimed the sandpainting acts as a portal to attract the spirits and allow them to come and go. Practitioners believe sitting on the sandpainting helps the patient to absorb spiritual power, while in turn the Holy People will absorb the illness and take it away. Afterward, when the sandpainting has served its purpose, it is considered to be toxic, since it has absorbed the illness. For this reason, the painting is destroyed. Because of the sacred nature of the ceremonies, the sandpaintings are begun, finished, used and destroyed within 12 hours.

[[File:Navajo sand painting (00171124).jpg|thumb|left|Navajo sandpainting, photo by [[H.S. Poley]], published c. 1890-1908, Library of Congress]]

The ceremonies involving sandpaintings are usually done in sequences, termed "chants", lasting a certain number of days depending on the ceremony. At least one fresh, new sandpainting is made for each day.

Some Navajo laws and taboos relate to the sandpaintings, and protect their holiness:
* Women of child-bearing age are not supposed to sing the chants associated with the ''yeibicheii''. This is both because the ceremony has a possibility of injuring an unborn child, and because of a taboo preventing menstruating women from attending. (Some cultures considered menstruation and presence of blood to be powerful spiritual events that had to be restrained, as they represented life forces.) Post-menopausal women are more likely to be chanters or diagnosticians.
* Authentic sandpaintings are rarely photographed, so as to not disrupt the flow of the ceremony. For many reasons, medicine men will seldom allow outsiders inside a sacred ceremony. Because so many outsiders are curious about sandpainting, some medicine men may create pieces for exhibition purposes only, using reversed colours and variations. To create an authentic sandpainting solely for viewing would be a [[Sacrilege|profane]] act. The sandpaintings for sale in shops and on the Internet are commercially produced and contain deliberate errors, as the real sandpaintings are considered sacred.
* The earliest credited instance of traditional Navajo sandpaintings (being rendered in coloured sands as opposed to tapestry or other media) being created in a permanent form for sale, have been traced to between 1945 and 1955. The main credit is generally given to a Navajo Hatałii named [[Fred Stevens, Jr. (Grey Squirrel)]], who developed the primary method of "permatizing" for commercial sandpaintings that is still used.&lt;ref name=Parezo&gt;Parezo, Nancy J. ''Navajo Sandpainting: From Religious Act to Commercial Art'', University of Arizona Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous Australian sandpainting===
[[File:Alice Springs4263.jpg|thumb|left|Artwork in Alice Springs]]
[[Indigenous Australian art]] has a history which covers more than 30,000 years, and a wide range of native traditions and styles.  These have been studied in recent decades and their complexity has gained increased international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Caruna, W.(2003) ''Aboriginal Art'', Thames and Hudson, London, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;  Aboriginal Art covers a wide variety of media, including sandpainting, painting on leaves, wood carving, rock carving, sculpture, and ceremonial clothing, as well as artistic embellishments found on weaponry and also tools.  Art is one of the key rituals of Aboriginal culture.  It was and still is, used to mark territory, record history, and tell stories about "[[Dreaming (spirituality)|The Dreaming]]".



Aboriginal people have taken to transforming their tradition sand paintings into more permanent forms using modern techniques and materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboriginalartdirectory.com/news/feature/ngurrara-the-great-sandy-desert-canvas.php|title=Ngurrara: The Great Sandy Desert Canvas Australian Aboriginal Art Feature at the Aboriginal Art Directory. View information about Ngurrara: The Great Sandy Desert Canvas|first=Aboriginal Art|last=Directory|date=|website=www.aboriginalartdirectory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey Bardon]] was an Australian art teacher who was instrumental in creating the [[Aboriginal art of the Western Desert]] movement, and in bringing Australian indigenous art to the attention of the world."... [directed by Bardon, the elders] began to interact with certain issues in 1960s and 70s international painting, especially the extreme schematisation of New York minimalism." In the [[History of Painting]]"Lyrical Abstraction in the late 1960s is characterised by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the fluxus movement and postminimalism (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of Artforum in 1969)&lt;ref name="sxdvrz"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt;  sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression."

This connection is seen most obviously in the connection between the paintings from the late sixties of [[Peter Young (artist)]] and the paintings that follow in the early seventies produced in the [[Papunya Tula]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?ViewID=1&amp;MnuID=SRCH&amp;GalID=1&amp;SubViewID=1&amp;BioArtistIRN=22094&amp;IRN=36943]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://algusgreenspon.com/wp-content/files_mf/1362697627PY_ARtforum_1971.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232257/http://algusgreenspon.com/wp-content/files_mf/1362697627PY_ARtforum_1971.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Papunya Tula]], or Papunya Tula Artists Pty Ltd, is an artist cooperative formed in 1972 that is owned and operated by Aboriginal people from the Western Desert of Australia. [[Kaapa Tjampitjinpa]] is one of the early Papunya Tula artists and is known for ''[[Gulgardi]]''. It is notable for being the first work by an Indigenous Australian artist to win a contemporary art award, and the first public recognition of a Papunya painting.&lt;ref name=Parezo/&gt;

=== Tibetan sandpainting ===
{{Main|Sand mandala}}[[File:348Sandbild im Sera Kloster.jpg|thumb|right|Mandala made of sand in the Sera Monastery, Lhasa]]
[[File:MandalaSable2008-05.JPG|Mandala Sable 2008-05 showing the use of [[Chak-pur]]|thumb|left]]
[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] sand paintings usually composed ''[[mandala]]s''. In Tibetan, it is called ''dul-tson-kyil-khor'' (mandala of coloured powders).
The sand is carefully placed on a large, flat table.  The construction process takes several days, and the mandala is destroyed shortly after its completion.  This is done as a teaching tool and metaphor for the "impermanence" (Pali: ''[[anicca]]'') of all contingent and compounded phenomena (Sanskrit: ''[[Pratītya-samutpāda]]'').

The mandala sand-painting process begins with an opening ceremony, during which the ''[[lama]]s'', or Tibetan priests, consecrate the site and call forth the forces of goodness.  They chant, declare intention, ''[[mudra]]'', ''[[asana]]'', ''[[pranayama]]'', do visualisations, play music, recite ''[[mantra]]s'', etc.
[[File:Mandala zel-tary.jpg|thumb|right|Mandala zel-tary using [[Vajra]] to ceremoniously divide the painting]]
[[File:Tibetan monks, Twentse Welle.JPG|thumb|left|Tibetan monks in a ceremony after having broken their mandala, Twentse Welle]]
On the first day, the lamas begin by drawing an outline of the mandala to be painted on a wooden platform.  The following days see the laying of the coloured sands, which is effected by pouring the sand from traditional metal funnels called '''[[chak-pur]]'''. Each monk holds a ''chak-pur'' in one hand, while running a metal rod on its serrated surface; the vibration causes the sands to flow like liquid.
Formed of traditional prescribed [[iconography]] that includes [[List of geometric shapes|geometric shapes]] and a multitude of ancient spiritual symbols (e.g.: [[Ashtamangala]] and divine attributes of ''[[yidam]]''), [[seed syllables]], [[mantra]], the sand-painted mandala is used as a tool or instrument for innumerable purposes.  A primary purpose is to reconsecrate the earth and its inhabitants.
When the meditation is complete, the sand painting is ceremoniously destroyed using a [[Vajra]] and the sand is then gathered and taken to a body of water for offering.

===Japanese tray pictures===
From the 15th century in Japan, [[Buddhist]] artists in the times of the ''[[shōgun]]s'' practised the craft of ''[[bonseki]]'' by sprinkling dry coloured sand and pebbles onto the surface of plain black lacquered trays.  They used bird feathers as brushes to form the sandy surface into seascapes and landscapes.  These tray pictures were used in religious ceremonies.  Japanese esoteric Buddhism was transmitted from East Central Asia after the 8th century, and thus these Japanese Buddhist sandpaintings may share earlier historical roots with the more intricate brightly coloured Buddhist sand mandalas created by Tibetan Buddhist monks.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Table decking===
During the 17th and 18th centuries, the royal courts of Europe employed "table deckers", who decorated the side tables at royal banquets having adapted the craft of 'bonseki' from the Japanese. The table deckers sprinkled coloured sands, marble dust, sugars, etc. upon the surface of plain white tablecloths to create unfixed pictures of fruit, flowers, birds and rustic scenery. In between each design spaces were left for fruit bowls and sweetmeat dishes so that the diners could refresh themselves in between the main courses of the feast. These ornate pictures were discarded along with the debris of the feast.

As a fine example of the table deckers' craft, [[Woburn Abbey]] in [[Bedfordshire]], England possesses an ornate [[folding screen]] with three panels, decorated with sand pictures protected by glass.  The centre one has five spaces for [[sweetmeat]] pyramid dishes while the two side leaves of the screen have three spaces for fruit trays.  There are four sand pictures in each corner of the side panels of the screen, featuring 18th-century pastoral scenes, while the remaining areas of the screen are decorated with butterflies, doves, fruit, flowers, etc. The screen would be laid upon the surface of a side table.  It doubled as a serving base for elaborate porcelain dishes and glass trays containing fruits, bonbons and sweetmeats, from which the hosts and their guests could help themselves while socialising or stretching their legs between the multiple courses being served on the main table in the dining hall.  This screen may have been the work of the German artisan [[F. Schweikhardt]], who specialised in still-life studies in the style of the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Painting|painter]] [[Jan van Huysum]].

===Georgian sandpainting===
[[File:"The Hermit" - Sand Painting by Benjamin Zobel.jpg|thumb|''A Hermit by a Wayside Shrine'' by Benjamin Zobel (early 19th century)]]
Sandpainting as a craft was inspired by King George III, who was a skilled watchmaker and craftsman in his own right, and took an interest in the skills demonstrated by royal functionaries, known as Table Deckers, who decorated the white table-cloths at royal banquets with ornate centre-pieces decorated by using unfixed coloured sands and sugars as 'paint', and a bird's feather as a 'brush' a craft introduced by a European traveller who had observed the craftsmen at work in Japan.

It was while watching the table deckers at work the King suggested that if the sand pictures being temporarily laid out upon the surface of the tablecloths could be fixed permanently in place rather than being discarded with the remains of the feast, this would save much time and energy employing a multitude of skilled embroiderers toiling over such skilled work. So on one occasion the King bellowed to the craftsmen, "Why don't you fix it!" This set a number of craftsmen including Haas, Schweikhardt and [[Benjamin Zobel]] (Memmingen, Germany, 21 September 1762 - London, England, 24 October 1830), all of German origin, to, independently of each other, successfully develop suitable methods to achieve this goal, and these pictures were commissioned by the royal worthies of the day and became highly prized by the aristocracy. [[Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany|The King's brother]], the Duke of York, commissioned a number of works by Zobel and the others, although the sand artists jealously guarded their method from their competitors.
Zobel depicted "pigs in the manner of Morland"; "Nelson", the favourite dog of the Duke of York; "Tiger after George Stubbs", and an impressive "Vulture and snake."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
Although many of Zobel's works have survived, few of those by Haas have survived the passage of time, although observers considered his work superior to that of Zobel. This may reflect the differing techniques used by each artist. A diarist observed Zobel's coating the surface of the baseboard with a mixture of [[gum arabic]] and [[white lead]] and sprinkling sand upon the sticky surface using a folded paper [[funnel]] as a brush. He had to work quickly since the adhesive would dry in a few hours. Several of his surviving pictures have unfinished work on the reverse. Haas followed more closely the techniques developed in Japan, but mixing dry powdered gum arabic with the sand, sprinkling the mixture through a sieve and using feathers as brushes to create the pictures upon the baseboard, then fixing them by some method which he kept a secret. Due to the damp conditions in many of the stately homes of the day, his pictures failed to last more than a few years. On one occasion Haas was called away while working on an unfixed sand picture. When he returned he found one of Windsor Castle's cats curled up on the picture, thus damaging it!

Eventually Zobel returned to [[Memmingen]] in Bavaria where he continued to successfully pursue his craft. Some of his work is displayed in Memmingen Town Hall. Haas was forced to give up sand painting, probably due to the ongoing disasters with his pictures. He opened a bakery in Windsor instead, and the icing on his cakes may well have been decorated with pictures in coloured sugar instead of sand.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

With the passing of these Georgian craftsmen and the disposal of the Duke of York's collection the interest and skills evolved in sand picture work declined. The only Royal personage to take further interest in the craft was the late Queen Mary, consort to King George V, who bequeathed her Georgian sand paintings to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and her collection of [[Isle of Wight]] sand pictures to [[Carisbrooke Castle|Carisbrooke Castle Museum]] on the Isle of Wight.

In the first half of the 20th century Lt. Colonel Rybot was a keen collector of sand paintings, which were the source material of the articles written on the subject in the arts and crafts magazines of the day. Eventually 37 of his collection of sand paintings were the main feature at an auction held at [[Sotheby's]] New Bond Street gallery on 15 June 1956.

===Victorian sand picture souvenirs===

Thousands of sites exist where it is possible to collect natural coloured sands for craftwork, with an enormous range of colours being available around the globe varying with the contents of the mineral charged waters leaching through the sands. But for the tourist the vertical sand cliffs at [[Alum Bay]] on the Isle of Wight form the central portion of a visual geological phenomenon (best viewed after a shower of rain) which encapsulates the impressive chalk spires of [[The Needles]] and [[Tennyson Downs]]. Although tourists are no longer encouraged to obtain their own sand from the cliffs, numerous companies on the Island sell sand for the purpose of Sandpainting.

After her marriage to Prince Albert and having chosen [[Osborne House]] near [[Cowes]] to be her new family retreat, [[Queen Victoria]] was the prime mover in the gentrification of this former backwater, local artisans benefitted from the influx of wealthy visitors, and a number of craftsmen sold their fixed sand pictures and unfixed sand jars featuring views of the Island as unique keepsakes of the Isle of Wight.

Some of these sand pictures were small and crude and left unsigned, but Edwin and John Dore of Arreton produced some fine work in the 1840s. The pictures were of postcard size and the subject matter local views such as Carisbrooke Castle, and other touristy subjects. Edwin always signed his quaint pictures in a fine hand with a mapping pen and Indian ink, one of his most successful mass-produced subjects being 'Collecting birds eggs on Needles Cliffs'. John Dore used a card embellished with a printed border of lace design on which to execute his sand pictures although the quality of his work was inferior to that of his brother.

Few of the Island sand artists filled in the sky, giving that detail a light colourwash as a finishing touch, sometimes leaving doors and windows free of sand which would be blocked in with Indian ink. In the 1860s and 1870s J. Symons of Cowes kept up the good work, producing local views much larger than postcard size, mounted in glazed oak or maple frames and signed with the artist's signature on the reverse.
The father and son team the Neates of Newport sold their works from a stall outside Carisbrooke Castle gates where visitors were offered sand pictures and sand jars priced from 1/- to 2/6 each and the son grew his fingernails abnormally long in order to distribute the sand on his pictures.
During the 1930s and 1940s R.J.Snow of Lake came nearest to producing sand pictures in the manner of the Georgian craftsmen, but postcard size, although he did produce some fine commissioned work, particularly a view of Oddicombe in Devon, in which the sea and sky were also 'painted' in sand, but after the war years the quality of the postcard sand pictures deteriorated with the mass-produced article with little taste or skill being offered for sale for a few shillings.

In Senegal, designs are glued to board and are typically of figures in the landscape.

===Sand bottles===

[[File:Sand Bottle - Andrew Clemens, 1879.jpg|thumb|right|Sand bottle by Andrew Clemens, 1879]]

In the 1860s to 1890s, [[Andrew Clemens]] a [[deaf mute]] born in Dubuque, Iowa, USA became famous for his craft of creating unfixed pictures using multicoloured sands compressed inside glass bottles or ornate chemist jars. The sand was collected from the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River. The subjects of his sand bottles included ornately decorated sentimental verses, sailing ships, plants, animals and portraits. 

He exhibited his work at the St. Louis trade fair and having spent hours creating a picture in a bottle would demonstrate to an incredulous audience that the picture inside was unfixed by destroying the bottle with a hammer. Clemens' sand bottles have become museum pieces and highly prized antiques which have since sold at auction for thousands of US dollars.

===Sand carpets===
[[File:Zandtapijt in Drentse keuken.jpg|thumb|Sandpainting on the tiled floor (on the wall are handpainted decorated tiles)]]
[[File:Plaza-centro.jpg|thumb|"Carpet" of land in the Town Hall Square in La Orotava [[Tenerife]] in celebration of Corpus Christi.]]
In the province of [[Drenthe]] in the Netherlands in the late 19th, early 20th centuries it was custom to use a stiff broom to sweep patterns in white sand to form simple decorations on the tiled floors of the houses, mostly for special occasions or celebrations. The next day it was swept up.
This custom was also practised in Northern Belgium by the Dutch speaking communities while in
Hekelgem, 1973 was the centenary year of the craft of "Old Zandtapijt". The hotels and cafes would employ artisans to strew ornate sand pictures in unfixed coloured sands on the tiled floors of their premises to encourage passing tourists to halt and enjoy local hospitality on their way towards Brussels. Roger de Boeck, born in 1930, was a well-respected exponent of this craft, who used glue to fix his sand pictures to a suitable base selling them to visitors to his atelier. In addition to biblical scenes, his finest works included a portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] 1953, and [[John F. Kennedy|US president John Kennedy]], in the early 60s. This craft continues, and a booklet to celebrate the centenary was published on 1 February 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Hekelgemse zandschilderkunst]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern culture==
[[File:Asynchronous Syntropy.jpg|thumb|left|"Asynchronous [[Syntropy]]" painting using coloured sand as seen at The Museum of Arts and Design "Swept Away" exhibit May 2012]]
In modern days, sandpainting is most often practised during [[Day of the Dead|Dia de los Muertos]] (Day of the Dead) in Mexico and the United States. Streets are decorated with sand paintings that are later swept away, symbolising the fleeting nature of life. Of note are the sandpaintings done during the [[Seattle]] [[Festál#Mexico: Día de Muertos|Dia De Muertos Festival]], but the most exciting development has been the Performance Art of Sand Animation which has created a new wave of younger artists and also revived interest in all types of sand painting.

A number of [[contemporary art]]ists use sand in ways that depart from specific cultural traditions exploring techniques by raking sand, pouring it, carving it, creating unique designs. The works are [[ephemeral]] and are primarily shared through documentation or part of a live performance.

Many of these artists were included in an exhibit at the [[Museum of Arts and Design]] in [[New York City]] titled "Swept Away: Dust, Ashes, and Dirt in Contemporary Art and Design" which was featured in the galleries in 2012.&lt;ref name="madmuseum1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.madmuseum.org/code/emuseum.asp?emu_action=advsearch&amp;rawsearch=exhibitionid/,/is/,/551/,/true/,/false&amp;profile=exhibitions |title=Museum of Arts and Design Collection Database |publisher=Collections.madmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202092125/http://collections.madmuseum.org/code/emuseum.asp?emu_action=advsearch&amp;rawsearch=exhibitionid%2F%2C%2Fis%2F%2C%2F551%2F%2C%2Ftrue%2F%2C%2Ffalse&amp;profile=exhibitions |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.madmuseum.org/html/exhibitions/551.html |title=Museum of Arts and Design Collection Database |publisher=Collections.madmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128023000/http://collections.madmuseum.org/html/exhibitions/551.html |archivedate=2012-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Curator [[David Revere McFadden]] described his reasoning for curating the exhibit as wanting to spotlight the work of contemporary artists who specialise in what he described as “unorthodox, unusual, or unexpected materials.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/03/01/mite-makes-right/ |title=Mite Makes Right |publisher=ARTnews |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present-day sand painting techniques===
[[File:Sand Painting of Mrs. Thatcher the 'Iron Lady' incorporating magnetised iron filings in the composition.jpg|thumb|upright|Brian Pike's 1985 portrait of [[Margaret Thatcher]] incorporates magnetised iron filings in the composition]]

Most artists use naturally occurring oxidised and mineral-charged coloured sands, adding powdered charcoal to widen the palette and in some instances idiosyncratic materials such as iron filings or discarded stonemasons' dust from ecclesiastical sites. Other artists use industrial tinted [[quartz]] sands with a capacity to resist [[intemperie]] action and a new generation of strong adhesives.  The work is protected with a coat of spray varnish. No protective glass frame is needed with the sands and the adhesives since the paintings have proved to resist the effect of direct sunlight without any yellowing of the varnish

[[Image:MarquetryOriental.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Oriental marquetry motif]]
'''Straw marquetry''' is a craft very similar to that of wood [[marquetry]], except that straw replaces the [[wood veneer]]. It is thought to have first been practised in the East; examples were brought to England in the 17th century.

To mimic the varying shades of wood veneer, [[wheat]] or [[oat]] straw has to be split, then soaked in cold, warm, or hot water. The strips are then ironed, and there will be a variety of tones from pale gold to deepest dark brown. 

There are accounts of nuns in France and Switzerland making a variety of items using straw marquetry.

The most famous straw marquetry was practised by prisoners of war from the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Dartmoor and other prisons had been built for them; the prison most famous for straw marquetry was Norman Cross, [[Huntingdon]]. 

[[Easter eggs]] are decorated with [[straw]] [[applique]], especially in Eastern European countries. Geometric shapes, stars and flower motifs are the most common themes. There is a slight difference in the way the straw is prepared, however; for marquetry, the straws are soaked, split and ironed; for [[Egg (biology)|egg]] decoration the straw is not ironed.

'''''The Car''''' is a [[1955 in art|1955]] painting by Australian artist [[John Brack]]. The painting depicts a family in a car on a drive in a rural area. The painting shows the father looking at the road ahead while the mother and children look towards the viewer.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Bronwyn|title=Public Works: The Car, 1955|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/public-works-the-car-1955/story-e6frg8n6-1225780496695|accessdate=3 May 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the whole car cannot be seen, the car itself is identifiable as a [[Triumph Mayflower]].&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; The landscape, seen through the windows of the car, has been said to be inspired by the work of his contemporary [[Fred Williams]].&lt;ref name="Änderson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Gary|title=Controversy dogs John Brack retrospective|url=http://www.artshub.com.au/news-article/opinions/visual-arts/controversy-dogs-john-brack-retrospective-177835|website=ArtsHub|publisher=ArtsHub Australia|accessdate=5 June 2016|date=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was painted around the same time as two of Brack's best-known paintings, ''[[Collins Street., 5 pm]]'' (1955) and  ''[[The Bar (painting)|The Bar]]'' (1954).&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

Brack described how he came to paint the work:

{{quote|Walking in a suburban street one day the car passed me and, as it did so, the occupants looked out. This seemed to compose itself as picture instantly, which I have found to be rare ... The paraphernalia of the street, houses and telegraph poles, seemed to rob the faces of dramatic emphasis. I think that the country landscape solved this problem and serves also to illustrate a social phenomenon important in our time: the family making an afternoon trip from the city to the nearby country on Sunday. It was part of the pattern of life of millions.|John Brack|&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;}}

Kirsty Grant, Senior Curator of Australian Art at the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] claims that ''The Car'' is one of Brack's more popular works stating "I think it transports people who lived through that time, whether they are adults or children, back to that era ...The Car is familiar. It is about people and the way we behave and our foibles."&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

The painting is part of the National Gallery of Victoria's Australian art collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/col/work/3139 National Gallery of Victoria Acquisition 1956]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was part of the ''Australia'' exhibition at the [[Royal Academy]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Nick|title=London awaits Australia, the exhibition|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/london-awaits-australia-the-exhibition-20130503-2iwzp.html|accessdate=3 May 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Prince''''' ({{lang-it|Il Principe}} {{IPA-it|il ˈprintʃipe|}}) is a 16th-century political [[discourse|treatise]] by the Italian diplomat and [[Political philosophy|political theorist]] [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]. From correspondence a version appears to have been distributed in 1513, using a Latin title, ''De Principatibus'' (''Of Principalities'').&lt;ref&gt;He wrote about a short study he was making by this Latin name in his letter to [[Francesco Vettori]], written 10 Dec 1513. This is letter 224 in the translated correspondence edition of James B. Atkinson and David Sices: {{Harvcoltxt|Machiavelli|1996|page=264}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the printed version was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli's death. This was done with the permission of the [[Medici]] pope [[Clement VII]], but "long before then, in fact since the first appearance of ''The Prince'' in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990}} p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was written as if it were a traditional work in the ''[[mirrors for princes]]'' style, it is generally agreed that it was especially innovative. This is only partly because it was written in the vernacular Italian rather than Latin, a practice which had become increasingly popular since the publication of Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' and other works of Renaissance literature.&lt;ref name="ITALIAN VERNACULAR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/06.html |title=Italian Vernacular Literature |work=Vlib.iue.it |accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938}} emphasizes similarities between ''The Prince'' and its forerunners, but still sees the same innovations as other commentators.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Prince'' is sometimes claimed to be one of the first works of [[modern philosophy]], especially modern [[political philosophy]], in which the effective truth is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal. It was also in direct conflict with the dominant Catholic and [[scholasticism|scholastic]] doctrines of the time concerning politics and ethics.&lt;ref name=counter&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although Machiavelli makes many references to classical sources, these do not include the customary deference to [[Aristotle]] which was to some extent approved by the church in his time. {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|p=222}} says that "Machiavelli indicates his fundamental disagreement with Aristotle's doctrine of the whole by substituting "[[Chance (Ancient Greek concept)|chance]]" (''caso'') for "[[Nature (philosophy)|nature]]" in the only context in which he speaks of "the beginning of the world." Strauss gives evidence that Machiavelli was knowingly influenced by [[Democritus]], whose philosophy of nature was, like that of [[modern science]], [[materialism|materialist]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is relatively short, the treatise is the most remembered of Machiavelli's works and the one most responsible for bringing the word "[[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]]" into usage as a pejorative. It even contributed to the modern negative connotations of the words "politics" and "politician" in western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of subject matter it overlaps with the much longer ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'', which was written a few years later. In its use of near-contemporary Italians as examples of people who perpetrated criminal deeds for politics, another lesser-known work by Machiavelli which ''The Prince'' has been compared to is the ''[[Life of Castruccio Castracani]]''.

The descriptions within ''The Prince'' have the general theme of accepting that the aims of princes – such as glory and survival – can justify the use of immoral means to achieve those ends:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1987|p=297}}: "Machiavelli is the only political thinker whose name has come into common use for designating a kind of politics, which exists and will continue to exist independently of his influence, a politics guided exclusively by considerations of expediency, which uses all means, fair or foul, iron or poison, for achieving its ends – its end being the aggrandizement of one's country or fatherland – but also using the fatherland in the service of the self-aggrandizement of the politician or statesman or one's party."&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|He who neglects what is done for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Machiavelli|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Prince_(Hill_Thomson)/Chapter_XV|chapter=Chapter 15|title=The Prince|publisher=[[Wikisource]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Summary ==
Each part of ''The Prince'' has been commented on over centuries. The work has a recognizable structure, for the most part indicated by the author himself. It can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{Harvcoltxt|de Alvarez|1999}} p. viii; and {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The subject matter: New Princedoms (Chapters 1 &amp; 2)===
''The Prince'' starts by describing the subject matter it will handle. In the first sentence Machiavelli uses the word "[[state (polity)|state]]" (Italian ''stato'' which could also mean "[[wikt:status|status]]") in order to neutrally cover "all forms of organization of supreme political power, whether republican or princely". The way in which the word state came to acquire this modern type of meaning during the [[Renaissance]] has been the subject of many academic discussions, with this sentence and similar ones in the works of Machiavelli being considered particularly important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Guarini|1999|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machiavelli said that ''The Prince'' would be about princedoms, mentioning that he has written about republics elsewhere (possibly referring to the ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'' although this is debated), but in fact he mixes discussion of republics into this in many places, effectively treating republics as a type of princedom also, and one with many strengths. More importantly, and less traditionally, he distinguishes new princedoms from hereditary established princedoms.&lt;ref name=Ch1&gt;{{Citation|last=Machiavelli |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/chapter1.html/ |chapter=Chapter 1 |title=The Prince |publisher=Constitution.org |accessdate=2010-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908090132/https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/chapter1.html |archivedate=2015-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He deals with hereditary princedoms quickly in Chapter 2, saying that they are much easier to rule. For such a prince, "unless extraordinary vices cause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be naturally well disposed towards him".&lt;ref name=Ch2&gt;{{Citation|last=Machiavelli |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/chapter2.html/ |chapter=Chapter 2 |title=The Prince |publisher=Constitution.org |accessdate=2010-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908092012/https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/chapter2.html |archivedate=2015-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938|pp=19–23}}, comparing this to traditional presentations of advice for princes, wrote that the novelty in chapters 1 and 2 is the "deliberate purpose of dealing with a new ruler who will need to establish himself in defiance of custom". Normally, these types of works were addressed only to hereditary princes. He thinks Machiavelli may have been influenced by [[Tacitus]] as well as his own experience, but finds no clear predecessor for this.

This categorization of regime types is also "un-Aristotelian"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and apparently simpler than the traditional one found for example in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Aristotle (Politics)|Politics]]'', which divides [[regime]]s into those ruled by a single monarch, an [[oligarchy]], or by the people, in a [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|de Alvarez|1999}} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He also ignores the classical distinctions between the good and corrupt forms, for example between monarchy and tyranny.

[[Xenophon]], on the other hand, made exactly the same distinction between types of rulers in the beginning  of his ''[[Education of Cyrus]]'' where he says that, concerning the knowledge of how to rule human beings, [[Cyrus the Great]], his exemplary prince, was very different "from all other kings, both those who have inherited their thrones from their fathers and those who have gained their crowns by their own efforts".&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Cyropaedia'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0204%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D4 1.1.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Machiavelli divides the subject of new states into two types, "mixed" cases and purely new states.

==="Mixed" princedoms (Chapters 3–5)===
New princedoms are either totally new, or they are “mixed” meaning that they are new parts of an older state, already belonging to that prince.&lt;ref name=Ch3&gt;{{Citation|last=Machiavelli |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/chapter3.html/ |chapter=Chapter 3 |title=The Prince |publisher=Constitution.org |accessdate=2010-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911052022/https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/chapter3.html |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New conquests added to older states (Chapter 3)====
Machiavelli generalizes that there were several virtuous Roman ways to hold a newly acquired province, using a republic as an example of how new princes can act:
* to install one's princedom in the new acquisition, or to install colonies of one's people there, which is better.
* to indulge the lesser powers of the area without increasing their power.
* to put down the powerful people.
* not to allow a foreign power to gain reputation.

More generally, Machiavelli emphasizes that one should have regard not only for present problems but also for the future ones. One should not “enjoy the benefit of time” but rather the benefit of one's virtue and prudence, because time can bring evil as well as good.

====Conquered kingdoms (Chapter 4)====
[[File:The Family of Darius before Alexander by Paolo Veronese 1570 fragment.jpg|right|thumb|A 16th-century Italian impression of the family of [[Darius III]], emperor of [[Persia]], before their conqueror, [[Alexander the Great]]. Machiavelli explained that in his time the [[Near East]] was again ruled by an empire, the [[Ottoman Empire]], with similar characteristics to that of Darius – seen from the viewpoint of a potential conqueror.]]

In some cases the old king of the conquered kingdom depended on his lords. 16th century France, or in other words France as it was at the time of writing of ''The Prince'', is given by Machiavelli as an example of such a kingdom. These are easy to enter but difficult to hold.

When the kingdom revolves around the king, with everyone else his servant, then it is difficult to enter but easy to hold. The solution is to eliminate the old bloodline of the prince. Machiavelli used the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian empire]] of [[Darius III]], conquered by [[Alexander the Great]], to illustrate this point and then noted that the Medici, if they think about it, will find this historical example similar to the "kingdom of the Turk" ([[Ottoman Empire]]) in their time – making this a potentially easier conquest to hold than France would be.

====Conquered Free States, with their own laws and orders (Chapter 5)====
{{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938|p=34}} notes that this chapter is quite atypical of any previous books for princes. Gilbert supposed the need to discuss conquering free republics is linked to Machiavelli's project to unite Italy, which contained some free republics. As he also notes, the chapter in any case makes it clear that holding such a state is highly difficult for a prince. Machiavelli gives three options:
* Ruin them, as Rome destroyed [[Carthage]], and also as Machiavelli says the Romans eventually had to do in Greece, even though they had wanted to avoid it.
* Go to live there (or install colonies, if you are a prince of a republic).
* Let them keep their own orders but install a puppet regime.

===Totally New States (Chapters 6–9)===

====Conquests by virtue (Chapter 6)====
[[File:Moses dore.jpg|thumb|left| Machiavelli described [[Moses]] as a conquering prince, who founded new modes and orders by force of arms, which he used willingly to kill many of his own people. The Bible describes the reasons behind his success differently.]]
Princes who rise to power through their own skill and resources (their "virtue") rather than luck tend to have a hard time rising to the top, but once they reach the top they are very secure in their position.  This is because they effectively crush their opponents and earn great respect from everyone else.  Because they are strong and more self-sufficient, they have to make fewer compromises with their allies.

Machiavelli writes that reforming an existing order is one of the most dangerous and difficult things a prince can do. Part of the reason is that people are naturally resistant to change and reform. Those who benefited from the old order will resist change very fiercely. By contrast, those who can benefit from the new order will be less fierce in their support, because the new order is unfamiliar and they are not certain it will live up to its promises.  Moreover, it is impossible for the prince to satisfy everybody's expectations. Inevitably, he will disappoint some of his followers. Therefore, a prince must have the means to force his supporters to keep supporting him even when they start having second thoughts, otherwise he will lose his power. Only armed prophets, like Moses, succeed in bringing lasting change. Machiavelli claims that Moses killed uncountable numbers of his own people in order to enforce his will.

Machiavelli was not the first thinker to notice this pattern. Allan Gilbert wrote: "In wishing new laws and yet seeing danger in them Machiavelli was not himself an innovator,"&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert. ''Machiavelli's Prince and Its Forerunners''. pg 39&lt;/ref&gt; because this idea was traditional and could be found in [[Aristotle]]'s writings. But Machiavelli went much further than any other author in his emphasis on this aim, and Gilbert associates Machiavelli's emphasis upon such drastic aims with the level of corruption to be found in Italy.

====Conquest by fortune, meaning by someone else’s virtue (Chapter 7)====
According to Machiavelli, when a prince comes to power through luck or the blessings of powerful figures within the regime, he typically has an easy time gaining power but a hard time keeping it thereafter, because his power is dependent on his benefactors' goodwill. He does not command the loyalty of the armies and officials that maintain his authority, and these can be withdrawn from him at a whim. Having risen the easy way, it is not even certain such a prince has the skill and strength to stand on his own feet.

This is not necessarily true in every case.  Machiavelli cites [[Cesare Borgia]] as an example of a lucky prince who escaped this pattern.  Through cunning political manoeuvrers, he managed to secure his power base.  Cesare was made commander of the papal armies by his father, [[Pope Alexander VI]], but was also heavily dependent on mercenary armies loyal to the Orsini brothers and the support of the French king.  Borgia won over the allegiance of the Orsini brothers' followers with better pay and prestigious government posts.  When some of his mercenary captains started to plot against him, he had them imprisoned and executed. When it looked as though the king of France would abandon him, Borgia sought new alliances.

Finally, Machiavelli makes a point that bringing new benefits to a conquered people will not be enough to cancel the memory of old injuries, an idea Allan Gilbert said can be found in [[Tacitus]] and [[Seneca the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert. ''Machiavelli's Prince and Its Forerunners''. pg 48&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conquests by “criminal virtue” (Chapter 8)====
Conquests by "criminal virtue" are ones in which the new prince secures his power through cruel, immoral deeds, such as the execution of political rivals.  Machiavelli advises that a prince should carefully calculate all the wicked deeds he needs to do to secure his power, and then execute them all in one stroke, such that he need not commit any more wickedness for the rest of his reign.  In this way, his subjects will slowly forget his cruel deeds and his reputation can recover. Princes who fail to do this, who hesitate in their ruthlessness, find that their problems mushroom over time and they are forced to commit wicked deeds throughout their reign. Thus  they continuously mar their reputations and alienate their people.

Machiavelli's case study is [[Agathocles of Syracuse]].  After Agathocles became Praetor of Syracuse, he called a meeting of the city's elite.  At his signal, his soldiers killed all the senators and the wealthiest citizens, completely destroying the old oligarchy. He declared himself ruler with no opposition. So secure was his power that he could afford to absent himself to go off on military campaigns in Africa.

However, Machiavelli then strongly rebukes Agathocles, stating, "Yet one cannot call it virtue to kill one's citizens, betray one's friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion; these modes can enable one to acquire empire, but not glory. [...] Nonetheless, his savage cruelty and inhumanity, together with his infinite crimes, do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men.  Thus, one cannot attribute to fortune or virtue what he achieved without either."

{{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938|pp=51–55}} remarks that this chapter is even less traditional than those it follows, not only in its treatment of criminal behavior, but also in the advice to take power from people at a stroke, noting that precisely the opposite had been advised by Aristotle in his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (5.11.1315a13). On the other hand, Gilbert shows that another piece of advice in this chapter, to give benefits when it will not appear forced, was traditional.

====Becoming a prince by the selection of one's fellow citizens (Chapter 9)====
A "civil principality" is one in which a citizen comes to power "not through crime or other intolerable violence", but by the support of his fellow citizens. This, he says, does not require extreme virtue or fortune, only “fortunate astuteness”.

Machiavelli makes an important distinction between two groups that are present in every city, and have very different appetites driving them: the "great" and the "people". The "great" wish to oppress and rule the "people", while the "people" wish ''not'' to be ruled or oppressed. A principality is not the only outcome possible from these appetites, because it can also lead to either "liberty" or "license".

A principality is put into place either by the "great" or the "people" when they have the opportunity to take power, but find resistance from the other side. They assign a leader who can be popular to the people while the great benefit, or a strong authority defending the people against the great. 

Machiavelli goes on to say that a prince who obtains power through the support of the nobles has a harder time staying in power than someone who is chosen by the common people; since the former finds himself surrounded by people who consider themselves his equals. He has to resort to malevolent measures to satisfy the nobles. &lt;blockquote&gt;One cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others, satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress, while the former only desire not to be oppressed&lt;/blockquote&gt;Also a prince cannot afford to keep the common people hostile as they are larger in number while the nobles smaller. 

Therefore the great should be made and unmade every day. There are two types of great people that might be encountered:
# Those who are bound to the prince. Concerning these it is important to distinguish between two types of obligated great people, those who are rapacious and those who are not. It is the latter who can and should be honoured.
# Those who are not bound to the new prince. Once again these need to be divided into two types: those with a weak spirit (a prince can make use of them if they are of good counsel) and those who shun being bound because of their own ambition (these should be watched and feared as enemies).
	
How to win over people depends on circumstances. Machiavelli advises:
* Do not get frightened in adversity.
* One should avoid ruling via magistrates, if one wishes to be able to “ascend” to absolute rule quickly and safely.	
* One should make sure that the people need the prince, especially if a time of need should come.

===How to judge the strength of principalities (Chapter 10)===
The way to judge the strength of a princedom is to see whether it can defend itself, or whether it needs to depend on allies. This does not just mean that the cities should be prepared and the people trained; a prince who is hated is also exposed.

===Ecclesiastical principates (Chapter 11)===
[[Image:Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leo X]]: a pope, but also a member of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]]. Machiavelli suggested they should treat the church as a princedom, as the [[House of Borgia|Borgia family]] had, in order to conquer Italy, and found new modes and orders.]]
This type of "princedom" refers for example explicitly to the Catholic church, which is of course not traditionally thought of as a princedom. According to Machiavelli, these are relatively easy to maintain, once founded. They do not need to defend themselves militarily, nor to govern their subjects.

Machiavelli discusses the recent history of the Church as if it were a princedom that was in competition to conquer Italy against other princes. He points to factionalism as a historical weak point in the Church, and points to the recent example of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] family as a better strategy which almost worked. He then explicitly proposes that the [[House of Medici|Medici]] are now in a position to try the same thing.

===Defense and military (Chapter 12–14)===
Having discussed the various types of [[principalities]], Machiavelli turns to the ways a state can attack other territories or defend itself. The two most essential foundations for any state, whether old or new, are sound laws and strong military forces.&lt;ref name=Ch12&gt;{{Citation|last=Machiavelli|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/chapter12.html|chapter=Chapter 12|title=The Prince|publisher=Constitution.org |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A self-sufficient prince is one who can meet any enemy on the battlefield. He should be "armed" with his own arms. However, a prince that relies solely on fortifications or on the help of others and stands on the defensive is not self-sufficient. If he cannot raise a formidable army, but must rely on defense, he must fortify his city. A well-fortified city is unlikely to be attacked, and if it is, most armies cannot endure an extended siege. However, during a siege a virtuous prince will keep the morale of his subjects high while removing all [[dissenters]]. Thus, as long as the city is properly defended and has enough supplies, a wise prince can withstand any siege.

Machiavelli stands strongly against the use of [[mercenary|mercenaries]], and in this he was innovative, and he also had personal experience in Florence. He believes they are useless to a ruler because they are undisciplined, cowardly, and without any loyalty, being motivated only by money. Machiavelli attributes the Italian city states’ weakness to their reliance on mercenary armies.

Machiavelli also warns against using auxiliary forces, troops borrowed from an ally, because if they win, the employer is under their favor and if they lose, he is ruined. Auxiliary forces are more dangerous than mercenary forces because they are united and controlled by capable leaders who may turn against the employer.

The main concern for a prince should be war, or the preparation thereof, not books. Through war a hereditary prince maintains his power or a private citizen rises to power. Machiavelli advises that a prince must frequently hunt in order to keep his body fit and learn the landscape surrounding his kingdom. Through this, he can best learn how to protect his territory and advance upon others. For intellectual strength, he is advised to study great military men so he may imitate their successes and avoid their mistakes. A prince who is diligent in times of peace will be ready in times of adversity. Machiavelli writes, “thus, when fortune turns against him he will be prepared to resist it.”

===The Qualities of a Prince (Chapters 14–19)===
Each of the following chapters presents a discussion about a particular virtue or vice that a prince might have, and is therefore structured in a way which appears like traditional advice for a prince. However, the advice is far from traditional.

====A Prince's Duty Concerning Military Matters (Chapter 14)====
Machiavelli believes that a prince's main focus should be on perfecting the art of war. He believes that by taking this profession a ruler will be able to protect his kingdom. He claims that "being disarmed makes you despised." He believes that the only way to ensure loyalty from one's soldiers is to understand military matters.
The two activities Machiavelli recommends practicing to prepare for war are physical and mental. Physically, he believes rulers should learn the landscape of their territories. Mentally, he encouraged the study of past military events. He also warns against idleness.

====Reputation of a prince (Chapter 15)====
Because, says Machiavelli, he wants to write something useful to those who understand, he thought it more fitting "to go directly to the effectual truth ("''verità effettuale''") of the thing than to the imagination of it". This section is one where Machiavelli’s pragmatic ideal can be seen most clearly. The prince should, ideally, be virtuous, but he should be willing and able to abandon those virtues if it becomes necessary. Concerning the behavior of a prince toward his subjects, Machiavelli announces that he will depart from what other writers say, and writes: {{quotation|Men have imagined republics and principalities that never really existed at all. Yet the way men live is so far removed from the way they ought to live that anyone who abandons what is for what should be pursues his downfall rather than his preservation; for a man who strives after goodness in all his acts is sure to come to ruin, since there are so many men who are not good.}}
Since there are many possible qualities that a prince can be said to possess, he must not be overly concerned about having all the good ones. Also, a prince may be perceived to be merciful, faithful, humane, frank, and religious, but most important is only to ''seem'' to have these qualities. A ''prince'' cannot truly have these qualities because at times it is ''necessary'' to act against them. In fact, he must sometimes deliberately choose evil. Although a bad reputation should be avoided, it is sometimes necessary to have one.

====Generosity vs. parsimony (Chapter 16)====
If a prince is overly generous to his subjects, Machiavelli asserts he will not be appreciated, and will only cause greed for more. Additionally, being overly generous is not economical, because eventually all resources will be exhausted. This results in higher taxes, and will bring grief upon the prince. Then, if he decides to discontinue or limit his generosity, he will be labeled as a miser. Thus, Machiavelli summarizes that guarding against the people’s hatred is more important than building up a reputation for generosity. A wise prince should be willing to be more reputed a miser than be hated for trying to be too generous.

On the other hand: "of what is not yours or your subjects' one can be a bigger giver, as were [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], and [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], because spending what is someone else's does not take reputation from you but adds it to you; only spending your own hurts you".

====Cruelty vs. Mercy (Chapter 17)====
[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus174.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Hannibal]] meeting [[Scipio Africanus]]. Machiavelli describes Hannibal as having the "[[virtue]]" of "inhuman cruelty". But he lost to someone, [[Scipio Africanus]], who showed the weakness of "excessive mercy" and who could therefore only have held power in a republic.]]
In addressing the question of whether it is better to be loved or feared, Machiavelli writes, “The answer is that one would like to be both the one and the other; but because it is difficult to combine them, it is far safer to be feared than loved if you cannot be both.” As Machiavelli asserts, commitments made in peace are not always kept in adversity; however, commitments made in fear are kept out of fear. Yet, a prince must ensure that he is not feared to the point of hatred, which is very possible.

This chapter is possibly the most well-known of the work, and it is important because of the reasoning behind Machiavelli’s famous idea that it is better to be feared than loved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Nicole |title=Feared Versus Loved: An Analysis of "The Prince" by Machiavelli |url=http://www.articlemyriad.com/197.htm |publisher=Article Myriad |accessdate=2011-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316183718/http://www.articlemyriad.com/197.htm |archivedate=16 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; – his justification is purely pragmatic; as he notes, “Men worry less about doing an injury to one who makes himself loved than to one who makes himself feared.” Fear is simply a means to an end, and that end is security for the prince. The fear instilled should never be excessive, for that could be dangerous to the prince. Above all, Machiavelli argues, a prince should not interfere with the property of their subjects, their women, or the life of somebody without proper justification.

Regarding the troops of the prince, fear is absolutely necessary to keep a large garrison united and a prince should not mind the thought of cruelty in that regard. For a prince who leads his own army, it is imperative for him to observe cruelty because that is the only way he can command his soldiers' absolute respect. Machiavelli compares two great military leaders: [[Hannibal]] and [[Scipio Africanus]]. Although Hannibal's army consisted of men of various races, they were never rebellious because they feared their leader. Machiavelli says this required "inhuman cruelty" which he refers to as a virtue. Scipio's men, on the other hand, were known for their mutiny and dissension, due to Scipio's "excessive mercy" – which was however a source of glory because he lived in a republic.

====In what way princes should keep their word (Chapter 18)====
Machiavelli notes that a prince is praised for keeping his word. However, he also notes that a prince is also praised for the illusion of being reliable in keeping his word. A prince, therefore, should only keep his word when it suits his purposes, but do his utmost to maintain the illusion that he does keep his word and that he is reliable in that regard. Therefore, a prince should not break his word unnecessarily.

As Machiavelli notes, “He should appear to be compassionate, faithful to his word, guileless, and devout. And indeed he should be so. But his disposition should be such that, if he needs to be the opposite, he knows how.” As noted in chapter 15, the prince must appear to be virtuous, and should be virtuous, but he should be able to be otherwise when the time calls for it; that includes being able to lie, though however much he lies he should always keep the appearance of being truthful.

====Avoiding contempt and hatred (Chapter 19)====
Machiavelli observes that most men are content as long as they are not deprived of their property and women. A prince should command respect through his conduct, because a prince that is highly respected by his people is unlikely to face internal struggles. Additionally, a prince who does not raise the contempt of the nobles and keeps the people satisfied, Machiavelli assures, should have no fear of conspirators. Machiavelli advises monarchs to have both internal and external fears. Internal fears exist inside his kingdom and focus on his subjects, Machiavelli warns to be suspicious of everyone when hostile attitudes emerge. External fears are of foreign powers.

===The Prudence of the Prince (Chapters 20–25)===

====Whether ruling conquests with fortresses works (Chapter 20)====
Machiavelli mentions that placing fortresses in conquered territories, although it sometimes works, often fails. Using fortresses can be a good plan, but Machiavelli says he shall "blame anyone who, trusting in fortresses, thinks little of being hated by the people". He cited [[Caterina Sforza]], who used a fortress to defend herself but was eventually betrayed by her people.

====Gaining honours (Chapter 21)====
A prince truly earns honour by completing great feats. [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand of Spain]] is cited by Machiavelli as an example of a monarch who gained esteem by showing his ability through great feats and who, in the name of religion, conquered many territories and kept his subjects occupied so that they had no chance to rebel.
Regarding two warring states, Machiavelli asserts it is always wiser to choose a side, rather than to be neutral. Machiavelli then provides the following reasons why:
* If your allies win, you benefit whether or not you have more power than they have.
* If you are more powerful, then your allies are under your command; if your allies are stronger, they will always feel a certain obligation to you for your help.
* If your side loses, you still have an ally in the loser.
Machiavelli also notes that it is wise for a prince not to ally with a stronger force unless compelled to do so. In conclusion, the most important virtue is having the wisdom to discern what ventures will come with the most reward and then pursuing them courageously.

====Nobles and staff (Chapter 22)====
The selection of good servants is reflected directly upon the prince’s intelligence, so if they are loyal, the prince is considered wise; however, when they are otherwise, the prince is open to adverse criticism. Machiavelli asserts that there are three types of intelligence:
* The kind that understands things for itself – which is excellent to have.
* The kind that understands what others can understand – which is good to have.
* The kind that does not understand for itself, nor through others – which is useless to have.

If the prince does not have the first type of intelligence, he should at the very least have the second type. For, as Machiavelli states, “A prince needs to have the discernment to recognize the good or bad in what another says or does even though he has no acumen himself".

====Avoiding flatterers (Chapter 23)====
This chapter displays a low opinion of flatterers; Machiavelli notes that “Men are so happily absorbed in their own affairs and indulge in such self-deception that it is difficult for them not to fall victim to this plague; and some efforts to protect oneself from flatterers involve the risk of becoming despised.”  Flatterers were seen as a great danger to a prince, because their flattery could cause him to avoid wise counsel in favor of rash action, but avoiding all advice, flattery or otherwise, was equally bad; a middle road had to be taken. A prudent prince should have a select group of wise counselors to advise him truthfully on matters all the time. All their opinions should be taken into account. Ultimately, the decision should be made by the prince and carried out absolutely. If a prince is given to changing his mind, his reputation will suffer. A prince must have the wisdom to recognize good advice from bad. Machiavelli gives a negative example in [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian I]]; Maximilian, who was secretive, never consulted others, but once he ordered his plans and met dissent, he immediately changed them.

===Prudence and chance===

====Why the princes of Italy lost their states (Chapter 24)====
After first mentioning that a new prince can quickly become as respected as a hereditary one, Machiavelli says princes in Italy who had longstanding power and lost it cannot blame bad luck, but should blame their own indolence. One "should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up". They all showed a defect of arms (already discussed) and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves with the great.

====Fortune (Chapter 25)====
As pointed out by {{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938|page=206}} it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but "Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with "sweat", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances.

Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that "it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down."&lt;ref name=Ch25&gt;{{Citation|last=Machiavelli|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/chapter25.html|chapter=Chapter 25|title=The Prince|publisher=Constitution.org |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert (p.&amp;nbsp;217) points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat [[Francesco Guicciardini]] expressed similar ideas about fortune.

Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As {{Harvcoltxt|de Alvarez|1999|pp=125–30}} points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to "fortune and God". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled.&lt;ref&gt;As [[Francis Bacon]] wrote in his 13th essay, quoted at {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|p=176}}, that "one of the doctors of Italy, Nicholas Machiavel, had the confidence to put in writing, almost in plain terms, ''That the Christian faith had given up good men in prey to those who are tyrannical and unjust''".&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians (Chapter 26)====

Pope [[Leo X]] was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book. {{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938|pp=222–30}} showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes. But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics. Indeed, one example is the Borgia family's "recent" and controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics, often brutally executed. This continues a controversial theme throughout the book.

==Analysis==
[[File:Anon-Cesare-Borgia.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cesare Borgia]], Duke of Valentinois. According to Machiavelli, a risk taker and example of "criminal virtue." Failed in the end because of one mistake: he was naive to trust a new Pope.]]
As shown by his letter of dedication, Machiavelli's work eventually came to be dedicated to [[Lorenzo II de' Medici, Duke of Urbino|Lorenzo di Piero de' Medici]], grandson of "[[Lorenzo the Magnificent]]", and a member of the ruling Florentine Medici family, whose uncle Giovanni became Pope [[Leo X]] in 1513. It is known from his personal correspondence that it was written during 1513, the year after the Medici took control of Florence, and a few months after Machiavelli's arrest, torture, and banishment by the in-coming Medici regime. It was discussed for a long time with [[Francesco Vettori]] – a friend of Machiavelli – whom he wanted to pass it and commend it to the Medici. The book had originally been intended for [[Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici]], young Lorenzo's uncle, who however died in 1516.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Najemy|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not certain that the work was ever read by any of the Medici before it was printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Dent|1995}} p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Machiavelli describes the contents as being an un-embellished summary of his knowledge about the nature of princes and "the actions of great men", based not only on reading but also, unusually, on real experience.&lt;ref name=Let&gt;{{Citation|last=Machiavelli|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/|chapter=Dedication|title=The Prince|publisher=Constitution.org |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The types of political behavior which are discussed with apparent approval by Machiavelli in ''The Prince'' were regarded as shocking by contemporaries, and its immorality is still a subject of serious discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Fischer|2000|p=181}} says that some people "might hold Machiavelli to some extent responsible for the crimes of a [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Mao Zedong|Mao]], or [[Pol Pot]], who had learned from him to excuse the murder of innocents by its supposed benefits for humanity." {{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958|p=12}} writes that "We shall not hesitate to assert, as very many have asserted before us, and we shall later on try to prove, that Machiavelli's teaching is immoral and irreligious."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the work advises princes how to tyrannize, Machiavelli is generally thought to have preferred some form of free republic.&lt;ref&gt;For example {{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958|p=182}}: "Machiavelli's book on principalities and his book on republics are both republican."&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators justify his acceptance of immoral and criminal actions by leaders by arguing that he lived during a time of continuous political conflict and instability in Italy, and that his influence has increased the "pleasures, equality and freedom" of many people, loosening the grip of medieval Catholicism's "classical [[teleology]]", which "disregarded not only the needs of individuals and the wants of the common man, but stifled innovation, enterprise, and enquiry into cause and effect relationships that now allow us to control [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Fischer|2000|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|p=11}} notes that "even if we were forced to grant that Machiavelli was essentially a patriot or a scientist, we would not be forced to deny that he was a teacher of evil".&lt;ref&gt;Concerning being a scientist, {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|pp=54–55}} says that this description of Machiavelli as a scientist "is defensible and even helpful provided it is properly meant" because ''The Prince'' "conveys a general teaching" and only uses specific historical facts and experience as a basis for such generalizing. On the other hand {{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958|p=11}}: "Machiavelli's works abound with "value-judgments". Concerning patriotism {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|pp=10–11}} writes that "Machiavelli understood it as collective selfishness." It is Machiavelli's indifferent "comprehensive reflection" about right and wrong, which is "the core of Machiavelli's thought," not love of the fatherland as such.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Machiavelli "was too thoughtful not to know what he was doing and too generous not to admit it to his reasonable friends".&lt;ref&gt;Much of Machiavelli's personal correspondence with other Florentines is preserved, including some of the most famous letters in Italian. Of particular interest for example, are some of his letters to [[Francesco Vettori]] and [[Francesco Guicciardini]], two men who had managed to stay in public service under the Medici, unlike Machiavelli. To Guicciardini for example he wrote concerning the selection of a preacher for Florence, that he would like a hypocritical one, and "I believe that the following would be the true way to go to Paradise: learn the way to Hell in order to steer clear of it." (Letter 270 in {{Harvcoltxt|Machiavelli|1996}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Machiavelli emphasized the need for [[realism in international relations theory|realism]], as opposed to [[idealism]]. Along with this, he stresses the difference between human-beings and animals since "there are two ways of contending, one in accordance with the laws, the other by force; the first of which is proper to men, the second to beast".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umich.instructure.com/courses/98476/files/folder/Readings?preview=2248113|title=U-M Weblogin|website=umich.instructure.com|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''The Prince'' he does not explain what he thinks the best ethical or political goals are, except the control of one's own fortune, as opposed to waiting to see what chance brings. Machiavelli took it for granted that would-be leaders naturally aim at glory or [[honour]]. He associated these goals with a need for "[[virtue]]" and "[[prudence]]" in a leader, and saw such virtues as essential to good politics and indeed the common good. That great men should develop and use their virtue and prudence was a traditional theme of advice to Christian princes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; And that more virtue meant less reliance on chance was a classically influenced "[[humanism|humanist]] commonplace" in Machiavelli's time, as {{Harvcoltxt|Fischer|2000|p=75}} says, even if it was somewhat controversial. However, Machiavelli went far beyond other authors in his time, who in his opinion left things to fortune, and therefore to bad rulers, because of their Christian beliefs. He used the words "virtue" and "prudence" to refer to glory-seeking and spirited excellence of character, in strong contrast to the traditional Christian uses of those terms, but more keeping with the original pre-Christian Greek and Roman concepts from which they derived.&lt;ref&gt;While pride is a sin in the Bible, "[[Fortune favours the bold]]", used for example by {{Harvcoltxt|Dent|1995}} p. xxii to summarize Machiavelli's stance concerning fortune, was a classical saying. That the desire for glory of spirited young men can and should be allowed or even encouraged, because it is how the best rulers come to be, is a theory expressed most famously by Plato in his ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. (See {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|p=289}}.) But as Strauss points out, Plato asserts that there is a higher type of life, and Machiavelli does not seem to accept this.&lt;/ref&gt; He encouraged ambition and risk taking. So in another break with tradition, he treated not only stability, but also radical [[innovation]], as possible aims of a prince in a political community. Managing major reforms can show off a Prince's virtue and give him glory. He clearly felt Italy needed major reform in his time, and this opinion of his time is widely shared.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{Harvcoltxt|Guarini|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Machiavelli's descriptions encourage leaders to attempt to control their fortune gloriously, to the extreme extent that some situations may call for a fresh "founding" (or re-founding) of the "modes and orders" that define a community, despite the danger and necessary evil and lawlessness of such a project. Founding a wholly new state, or even a new religion, using injustice and immorality has even been called the chief theme of ''The Prince''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1987|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machiavelli justifies this position by explaining how if "a prince did not win love he may escape hate" by personifying injustice and immorality; therefore, he will never loosen his grip since "fear is held by the apprehension of punishment" and never diminishes as time goes by. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umich.instructure.com/courses/98476/files/folder/Readings?preview=2248113|title=U-M Weblogin|website=umich.instructure.com|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a political theorist to do this in public was one of Machiavelli's clearest breaks not just with medieval scholasticism, but with the classical tradition of [[political philosophy]], especially the favorite philosopher of Catholicism at the time, [[Aristotle]]. This is one of Machiavelli's most lasting influences upon [[modernity]].

Nevertheless, Machiavelli was heavily influenced by classical pre-Christian [[political philosophy]]. According to {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|p=291}} Machiavelli refers to [[Xenophon]] more than Plato, Aristotle, and [[Cicero]] put together. Xenophon wrote one of the classic mirrors of princes, the ''[[Education of Cyrus]]''. {{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938|p=236}} wrote: "The Cyrus of Xenophon was a hero to many a literary man of the sixteenth century, but for Machiavelli he lived". Xenophon also, as Strauss pointed out, wrote a dialogue, ''[[Hiero (Xenophon)|Hiero]]'' which showed a wise man dealing sympathetically with a tyrant, coming close to what Machiavelli would do in questioning the ideal of "the imagined prince". Xenophon however, like Plato and Aristotle, was a follower of [[Socrates]], and his works show approval of a "[[teleological argument]]", while Machiavelli rejected such arguments. On this matter, {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|pp=222–23}} gives evidence that Machiavelli may have seen himself as having learned something from [[Democritus]], [[Epicurus]] and [[atomism|classical materialism]], which was however not associated with political realism, or even any interest in politics.

On the topic of [[rhetoric]] Machiavelli, in his introduction, stated that “I have not embellished or crammed this book with rounded periods or big, impressive words, or with any blandishment or superfluous decoration of the kind which many are in the habit of using to describe or adorn what they have produced”. This has been interpreted as showing a distancing from traditional rhetoric styles, but there are echoes of classical rhetoric in several areas.  In Chapter 18, for example, he uses a metaphor of a lion and a fox, examples of cunning and force; according to {{Harvcoltxt|Zerba|2004|p=217}}, “the Roman author from whom Machiavelli in all likelihood drew the simile of the lion and the fox” was Cicero. The ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', a work which was believed during Machiavelli’s time to have been written by Cicero, was used widely to teach rhetoric, and it is likely that Machiavelli was familiar with it. Unlike Cicero's more widely accepted works however, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Cox|1997|p=1122}}, “Ad Herennium ... offers a model of an ethical system that not only condones the practice of force and deception but appears to regard them as habitual and indeed germane to political activity”. This makes it an ideal text for Machiavelli to have used.

{{quotation|...there were in circulation approximately fifteen editions of the ''Prince'' and nineteen of the ''Discourses'' and French translations of each before they were placed on [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|the Index]] of [[Paul IV]] in 1559, a measure which nearly stopped publication in Catholic areas except in France. Three principal writers took the field against Machiavelli between the publication of his works and their condemnation in 1559 and again by the Tridentine Index in 1564. These were the English cardinal [[Reginald Pole]] and the Portuguese bishop [[Jerónimo Osório]], both of whom lived for many years in Italy, and the Italian humanist and later bishop, [[Ambrogio Caterino Politi]].}}

Machiavelli's ideas on how to accrue honour and power as a leader had a profound impact on political leaders throughout the modern west, helped by the new technology of the printing press. Pole reported that it was spoken of highly by his enemy [[Thomas Cromwell]] in England, and had influenced [[Henry VIII]] in his turn towards [[Protestantism]], and in his tactics, for example during the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]].&lt;ref name=BireleyP15&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy was also possessed by the Catholic king and emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Haitsma Mulier|1999|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, after an initially mixed reaction, Machiavelli came to be associated with [[Catherine de Medici]] and the [[St Bartholomew's Day Massacre]]. As {{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=17}} reports, in the 16th century, Catholic writers "associated Machiavelli with the Protestants, whereas Protestant authors saw him as Italian and Catholic". In fact, he was apparently influencing both Catholic and Protestant kings.&lt;ref&gt;While Bireley focuses on writers in the Catholic countries, {{Harvcoltxt|Haitsma Mulier|1999}} makes the same observation, writing with more of a focus upon the Protestant [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important early works dedicated to criticism of Machiavelli, especially ''The Prince'', was that of the [[Huguenot]], [[Innocent Gentillet]], ''Discourse against Machiavelli'', commonly also referred to as ''Anti Machiavel'', published in [[Geneva]] in 1576. He accused Machiavelli of being an atheist and accused politicians of his time by saying that they treated his works as the "[[Koran]] of the courtiers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theme of Gentillet was more in the spirit of Machiavelli himself: he questioned the effectiveness of immoral strategies (just as Machiavelli had himself done, despite also explaining how they could sometimes work). This became the theme of much future political discourse in Europe during the 17th century. This includes the Catholic [[Counter Reformation]] writers summarised by Bireley: [[Giovanni Botero]], [[Justus Lipsius]], [[Carlo Scribani]], [[Adam Contzen]], [[Pedro de Ribadeneira]], and [[Diego Saavedra Fajardo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors criticized Machiavelli, but also followed him in many ways. They accepted the need for a prince to be concerned with reputation, and even a need for cunning and deceit, but compared to Machiavelli, and like later modernist writers, they emphasized [[economic growth|economic progress]] much more than the riskier ventures of war. These authors tended to cite [[Tacitus]] as their source for realist political advice, rather than Machiavelli, and this pretense came to be known as "[[Tacitean studies|Tacitism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|pp=223–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[materialism|materialist]] philosophy developed in the 16th, 17th and 18th century, starting in the generations after Machiavelli. The importance of Machiavelli's realism was noted by many important figures in this endeavor, for example [[Jean Bodin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=17}}: "Jean Bodin's first comments, found in his ''Method for the Easy Comprehension of History'', published in 1566, were positive."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Bacon]],&lt;ref&gt;Bacon wrote: "We are much beholden to Machiavelli and other writers of that class who openly and unfeignedly declare or describe what men do, and not what they ought to do." {{Citation|title=Of the Advancement of Learning|chapter=II.21.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Harrington (author)|Harrington]], [[John Milton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Worden|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spinoza's Political Philosophy|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-political/#IntBac|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=2011-03-19|publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[David Hume|Hume]],&lt;ref&gt;Danford "Getting Our Bearings: Machiavelli and Hume" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]], and [[Adam Smith]]. Although he was not always mentioned by name as an inspiration, due to his controversy, he is also thought to have been an influence for other major philosophers, such as [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaefer|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes|Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kennington|2004}}, chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]]&lt;ref&gt;Barnes Smith "The Philosophy of Liberty: Locke's Machiavellian Teaching" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Montesquieu]].&lt;ref&gt;Carrese "The Machiavellian Spirit of Montesquieu's Liberal Republic" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}. Shklar "Montesquieu and the new republicanism" in {{Harvtxt|Bock|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In literature:
* Machiavelli is featured as a character in the [[prologue]] of [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[The Jew of Malta]]''.
* In [[William Shakespeare's]] tragedy, ''[[Othello]]'', the antagonist [[Iago]] has been noted by some literary critics as being archetypal in adhering to Machiavelli's ideals by advancing himself through machination and duplicity with the consequence of causing the demise of both [[Othello (character)|Othello]] and [[Desdemona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stjohns-chs.org/english/Renaissance/mach.html | title=Machiavelli and Renaissance Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst later political leaders:
* The republicanism in seventeenth century England which led to the [[English civil war]], [[Glorious Revolution]] and subsequent development of the [[English Constitution]] was strongly influenced by Machiavelli's political thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Worden|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most of the [[founding fathers]] of the [[American Revolution]] are known or often proposed to have been strongly influenced by Machiavelli's political works, including [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[James Madison]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[John Adams]].&lt;ref name=thompson&gt;{{Harvtxt|Thompson|1995}}{{Dead link|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walling "Was Alexander Hamilton a Machiavellian Statesman?" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harper|2004}}{{Dead link|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Under the guidance of [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick the Great]] of [[Prussia]] criticised Machiavelli's conclusions in his "[[Anti-Machiavel]]", published in 1740.
* At different stages in his life, [[Napoleon I of France]] wrote extensive comments to ''The Prince''. After his defeat at [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], these comments were found in the emperor's coach and taken by the Prussian military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Machiavelli|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Italians|Italian]] dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] wrote a discourse on ''The Prince''.&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, "Preludio al ''Principe''", ''[[Gerarchia]]'' 3 (1924).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]] read ''The Prince'' and annotated his own copy.&lt;ref&gt;Stalin: A Biography By Robert Service&lt;/ref&gt;

20th century Italian-American [[mobster]]s were influenced by ''The Prince''. [[John Gotti]] and [[Roy DeMeo]] would regularly quote ''The Prince'' and consider it to be the
"[[American mafia|Mafia]] Bible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gotti/up_4.html |title=John Gotti – The Last Mafia Icon – Moving Up – Crime Library on |work=Trutv.com |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231090947/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gotti/up_4.html |archivedate=2011-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/roy_demeo/6.html |title=Roy DeMeo – Another Perspective – Crime Library on |work=Trutv.com |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121111332/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/roy_demeo/6.html |archivedate=2012-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation of ''The Prince'' as political satire or as deceit==
As discussed by {{Harvtxt|Johnston|1958}} many authors have historically argued that "the book is, first and foremost, a satire, so that many of the things we find in it which are morally absurd, specious, and contradictory, are there quite deliberately in order to ridicule ... the very notion of tyrannical rule". Hence, Johnston says, "the satire has a firm moral purpose – to expose tyranny and promote republican government."&lt;ref&gt;See also {{Harvtxt|Mattingly|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This position was the standard one in Europe during the 18th century, amongst the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ''[[philosophes]]''. [[Diderot]] thought it was a satire. And in his [[Social Contract (Rousseau)|''The Social Contract'']], the French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] said: {{quotation|Machiavelli was a proper man and a good citizen; but, being attached to the court of the Medici, he could not help veiling his love of liberty in the midst of his country's oppression. The choice of his detestable hero, [[Caesar Borgia]], clearly enough shows his hidden aim; and the contradiction between the teaching of the ''Prince'' and that of the ''Discourses on Livy'' and the ''History of Florence'' shows that this profound political thinker has so far been studied only by superficial or corrupt readers. The Court of Rome sternly prohibited his book. I can well believe it; for it is that Court it most clearly portrays.|[http://www.constitution.org/jjr/socon_03.htm#23 ''Social Contract'', Book 3, note to Chapter 6].}}

Whether or not the word "satire" is the best choice, there is more general agreement that despite seeming to be written for someone wanting to be a monarch, and not the leader of a republic, ''The Prince'' can be read as deliberately emphasizing the benefits of free republics as opposed to monarchies.

Differences of opinion amongst commentators revolve around whether this sub-text was intended to be understood, let alone understood as deliberately satirical or comic.

One such commentator, Mary Dietz, writes that Machiavelli's agenda was not to be satirical, as Rousseau had argued, but instead was "offering carefully crafted advice (such as arming the people) designed to undo the ruler if taken seriously and followed."&lt;ref&gt;Deitz, M., 1986, “Trapping the Prince: Machiavelli and the Politics of Deception,” American Political Science Review, 80: 777–99.&lt;/ref&gt; By this account, the aim was to reestablish the republic in Florence. She focuses on three categories in which Machiavelli gives paradoxical advice:
* He discourages liberality and favors deceit to guarantee support from the people. Yet Machiavelli is keenly aware of the fact that an earlier pro-republican coup had been thwarted by the people's inaction that itself stemmed from the prince's liberality.
* He supports arming the people despite the fact that he knows the Florentines are decidedly pro-democratic and would oppose the prince.
* He encourages the prince to live in the city he conquers. This opposes the Medici's habitual policy of living outside the city. It also makes it easier for rebels or a civilian militia to attack and overthrow the prince.

According to Dietz the trap never succeeded because Lorenzo – "a suspicious prince" – apparently never read the work of the "former republican."&lt;ref&gt;Deitz, M., 1986, "[http://digilib.bc.edu/reserves/po041/kell/po04107.pdf Trapping the Prince: Machiavelli and the Politics of Deception]," American Political Science Review, 80: 796.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian Marxist philosopher [[Antonio Gramsci]] argued that Machiavelli's audience for this work was not the classes who already rule (or have "hegemony") over the common people, but the common people themselves, trying to establish a new hegemony, and making Machiavelli the first "Italian [[Jacobin]]".&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{citation|title=Antonio Gramsci and the Origins of Italian Communism|author=John McKay Cammett|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTCsAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA210.|isbn=9780804701419|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans Baron is one of the few major commentators who argues that Machiavelli must have changed his mind dramatically in favour of free republics, after having written ''The Prince''.{{sfn|Baron|1961}}

'''''The Wandering Jew''''' is a 1933 British fantasy drama film produced by the [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]]-[[Twickenham Film Studios]]. It is the story of a Jew (played by [[Conrad Veidt]]) who is forced to wander the Earth for centuries because he rebuffed [[Jesus]] while he was carrying his cross.

Other cast members included a very young [[Peggy Ashcroft]], [[Francis L. Sullivan]], and [[Felix Aylmer]].

==Plot==
The plot follows the [[The Wandering Jew|eponymous character's]] epic journey. He is finally burnt at the stake by the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. As he burns, he is forgiven by God and finally allowed to die. The story bears a resemblance to the legend of the [[Flying Dutchman]].

==Portrayal of Jews==
Unlike the [[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|antisemitic propaganda film produced by the Nazis in 1940]], this film portrayed Jews in a favorable light as the victims of unjustified persecution throughout history, in the [[Spanish Inquisition]], for example. The Nazi propaganda film, by contrast, was  intended as violently anti-Semitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Saul|last= Friedlander|year=2008|title='The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews 1939-1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Etty Britomart 1833.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret]]'', [[William Etty]] (1833)]]

The portrayal of '''[[Warrior|women warriors]]''' in [[literature]] and [[popular culture]] is a subject of study in history, literary studies, film studies, folklore history, and mythology. The archetypal figure of the woman warrior is an example of a normal thing that happens in some cultures, while also being a [[counter stereotype]], opposing the normal construction of war, violence and aggression as masculine.&lt;ref name="Stringer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stringer|first1=Rebecca|editor1-last=Radner|editor1-first=Hilary|editor2-last=Stringer|editor2-first=Rebecca|title=Feminism at the Movies|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|chapter=From Victim to Vigilante: Gender, Violence, and Revenge in ''The Brave One'' (2007) and ''Hard Candy'' (2005)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|269}} This convention-defying position makes the female warrior a prominent site of investigation for discourses surrounding female power and [[gender roles]] in society.

==Folklore and mythology==
[[File:Medieval women as warriors.jpg|thumb|upright|Medieval women helping to defend the city from attack.]]
{{See also|List of women warriors in folklore}}
In Hindu mythology, [[Chitrāngadā]], wife of [[Arjuna]], was the commander of her father's armies.

The [[Amazons]] were an entire tribe of woman warriors in Greek legend. "Amazon" has become an [[eponym]] for woman warriors and athletes in both modern and ancient society.

In British mythology, [[Queen Cordelia]] fought off several contenders for her throne by personally leading the army in its battles as well as defending her home from her own warring family members, until she eventually commits suicide due to grief. Another example in ancient British history is Queen [[Boudica]], who lead a rebellion against the [[Roman Empire]].

In his ''On the Bravery of Women'' the Greco-Roman historian [[Plutarch]] describes how the women of Argos fought against King Cleomenes and the Spartans under the command of [[Telesilla]] in the fifth century BCE.&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Bravery_of_Women*/A.html|title=Plutarch • On the Bravery of Women — Sections I‑XV|publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women Writers of Ancient Greece and Rome: An Anthology|author=Plant, I.M.|date=2004|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806136219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYGay_yqBLUC|page=33|accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature, film, and television==
{{See also|List of female action heroes and villains}}
Literary women warriors include "[[Gordafarid]]" (Persian: گردآفريد) in the ancient Persian epic poem [[The Shāhnāmeh]], [[Delhemma]] in [[Arabic epic literature]], [[Mulan]], [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Belphoebe]] and [[Britomartis|Britomart]] in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', [[Bradamante]] and [[Marfisa]] in ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', [[Clorinda (Jerusalem Delivered)|Clorinda]] and (reluctantly) Erminia in ''[[La Gerusalemme liberata]]'', and [[Grendel's mother]].

The woman warrior is part of a long tradition in many different cultures including Chinese and Japanese martial arts films, but their reach and appeal to Western audiences is possibly much more recent, coinciding with the greatly increased number of female heroes in American media since 1990.&lt;ref name="Heinecken"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Warrior Women of Television: A Feminist Cultural Analysis of the Female Body in Popular Media|date=2003|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|last1=Dawn|first1=Heinecken}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|136}}&lt;ref name="Tasker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tasker|first1=Yvonne|title=Spectacular Bodies: Gender, Genre and the Action Cinema|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}

==In feminism==
Women warriors have been taken up as a symbol for feminist empowerment, emphasizing women's agency and capacity for power instead of the common pattern of female victim-hood.&lt;ref name="Stringer" /&gt;{{rp|269}}  Professor Sherrie Inness in ''Tough Girls: Women Warriors and Wonder Women in Popular Culture''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/945.html Tough Girls: Women Warriors and Wonder Women in Popular Culture]''&lt;/ref&gt; and Frances Early and Kathleen Kennedy in ''Athena's Daughters: Television's New Women Warriors'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.syracuseuniversitypress.syr.edu/spring-2003-catalog/athenas-daughters.html Athena’s Daughters: Television’s New Women Warriors]''&lt;/ref&gt; for example, focus on figures such as [[Xena]], from the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' or [[Buffy Summers]] from ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. In the introduction to their text, Early and Kennedy discuss what they describe as a link between the image of women warriors and [[Girl Power|girl power]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=238391094059727 Book review]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Violence===
Although there is a distinction between positive aggression and violence, fictional representations of female violence like ''[[Kill Bill]]'' still have the power to function positively, equipping women for real-life situations that require outward aggression.&lt;ref name=Lavin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lavin|first1=Maud|title=Push Comes to Shove: New Images of Aggressive Women|date=2010|publisher=MIT|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|108,237}} Beyond the individual level, fictional depictions of violence by women can be a political tool to draw attention to real-world issues of violence, such as the ongoing violence against Indigenous women.&lt;ref name=Verstraten&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verstraten|first1=Katelyn|title=For Indigenous Women, Radical Art as a Last Resort|url=https://thetyee.ca/ArtsAndCulture/2013/06/22/Radical-Art/|accessdate=1 November 2015|work=The Tyee|date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that a violent heroine undermines the feminist ethics against male violence, even when she is posited as a defender of women, for example in films such as ''[[Hard Candy (film)|Hard Candy]]''.&lt;ref name=Stringer /&gt;{{rp|269}}

'''Yvette Pierpaoli''' (18 March 1938 &amp;ndash; 18 April 1999) was a French [[humanitarian]] who lived in [[Cambodia]] and worked in many countries around the world. [[John le Carré]] dedicated his novel ''[[The Constant Gardener]]'' to her.

==Early life==
Pierpaoli was born in [[Le Ban-Saint-Martin]], the fifth child of an Italian father and a French mother. She first became interested in the Far East during a geography lesson about [[Indochina]]. Her turbulent character manifested itself in an aggressive attitude towards her family and classmates, earning her the nickname "the pest".
After leaving school at the age of fifteen, Pierpaoli found a job as an office clerk. During this time she became interested in amateur radio communication and became one of the first French amateur radio operators. In 1958, after a confrontation with her father, she left the family home and went to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Pierpaoli, Yvette. ''Woman of a Thousand Children'', p. 18.  Unpublished English translation of ''La Femme Aux Milles Enfants'' Paris: Robert Laffont, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indochinese refugees==

Pierpaoli came into contact with the Asian community in Paris. After a love affair with a Kampuchean medical student, she became pregnant and had a daughter. In 1967, aged 29, she traveled to [[Cambodia]] with her baby daughter. In [[Phnom Penh]] she proved to be an excellent businesswoman, selling small planes, tractors and chemicals and trading in rice.  By 1974, a large number of refugees were pouring into Phnom Penh, fleeing the advance of the [[Khmer Rouge]]. Moved by their plight, Pierpaoli devoted much of her time to helping refugee children, adopting one of them and supporting many others. She became head of [[Continental Air Services, Inc]] in Cambodia, which flew regularly between Phnom Penh and [[Bangkok]] on behalf of the U.S. Embassy and other organizations. She was described by a journalist as "an adventurer with a big heart, works for the [[CIA]]."  Pierpaoli denied working for the CIA, although the CIA was a source of funding for Continental.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Larry Clinton.  ''Refugee Workers in the Indochina Exodus, 1975-1982.''  Jefferson, NC: MacFarland, 2010, p. 34.

In 1974, Pierpaoli met author [[John le Carré]] in Phnom Penh.  He described her as a "small, sparky, tough, brown-eyed provincial Frenchwoman" with "an absolutely non-negotiable, visceral requirement...to get food and money to the starving, medicines to the sick, shelter for the homeless, paper for the stateless...This did not in any way prevent her from being a resourceful and frequently shameless businesswoman, particularly when she was pitched against people whose cash, in her unshakable opinion, would be better in the pockets of the needy."&lt;ref&gt;Le Carre, John "The Constant Muse" ''The Observer'' Saturday, 24 Feb 2001, https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/feb/25/fiction.features2, accessed 20 Aug 2012&lt;/ref&gt;    

As Phnom Penh came under siege by the Khmer Rouge, Pierpaoli moved to Bangkok. After the Khmer Rouge victory in April 1975, she began visiting refugee camps on the border of [[Thailand]] to help Cambodians who fled their country and sought refuge in Thailand. Plying the border with a small car, she brought them food and medicine and took into her house in Bangkok as many as she could help escape. In 1979, the Thai government forcibly repatriated thousands of Cambodian refugees.  Pierpaoli, along with American [[Lionel Rosenblatt]], rescued as many refugees as possible before they were forced across the border, especially at [[Preah Vihear Temple]], where 40,000 Cambodians were pushed off a cliff into a minefield. Thousands died as they attempted to cross the minefield.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 174-178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refugees International==

In 1985, Pierpaoli left her business and returned to France, settling near [[Uzès]].  She met a young monk from Guatemala, who described the plight of his country, just emerging from civil war. She founded a charity, collected money and went to [[Zaculeu]], a village in Guatemala. Joined by several volunteers, she undertook to rebuild the houses, to dig wells and to return the land to cultivation, demonstrating that "a single person can sometimes achieve what large organizations cannot....I realized what made me different from others in how I conceptualized humanitarian work.  They assumed that a project had to have ideas, personnel, and materials, and funds, all the elements of a project, first.  In my mind, things happened in the opposite way....The idea of having to decide in advance how things were going to happen in order to arrive at a fixed objective seemed unnatural to me."&lt;ref&gt;Pierpaoli, pp 207-208&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pierpaoli published her autobiography ''Woman of a Thousand Children'' in 1992 and became the European Representative of [[Refugees International]] (RI) the same year.  During the 1990s, along with colleagues RI President Rosenblatt and Advocacy Director Larry Clinton Thompson, she undertook missions to humanitarian disaster areas in [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Albania]], and Southeast Asia.  On April 18, 1999, while on a mission to assist refugees from [[Kosovo]], she was one of four people killed in an automobile accident while traveling from [[Tirana, Albania|Tirana]] to [[Kukës]], Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Refugees International |url=http://reliefweb.int/node/45871 |title=Refugees International Representatives Confirmed Dead |work=Refugees International |location=US |date=19 April 1999 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ziwiye hoard''' is a treasure hoard containing gold, silver, and ivory objects, also including a few [[Luristan bronze|Luristan]] pieces, that was uncovered on the south shore of [[Lake Urmia]] in [[Ziwiyeh]], [[Kurdistan Province]], Iran, in 1947.

==Provenance==
Objects from the hoard provide a link between the cultures of the [[Iranian plateau]] and the nomadic or [[Scythian art]] forms known as the "[[animal style]]". "The Scythian motives adopted by [[Urartu]] account for the decoration of the great Treasure of [[Sakiz]] brought to light on the south shore of Lake Urmia," was [[Leonard Woolley]]'s assessment (Woolley 1961 p 176).

==Style==
The hoard contains objects in four styles: Assyrian, Scythian, proto-[[Achaemenid]], and the provincial native pieces. Dated ''ca.'' 700 BC, this collection of objects illustrates the situation of the Iranian plateau as a crossroads of cultural highways&amp;mdash;not least of them the [[Silk Road]]&amp;mdash;which fused disparate cultures to inform early Iranian art. The objects have also been related to finds at [[Teppe Hasanlu]] and [[Marlyk]].&lt;ref&gt;Talbot Rice, 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current location==
Examples of the ''Ziwiye Treasure'' are scattered among public and private collections. A 'Ziwiye' provenance may have been applied to comparable objects that have passed through the trade since the 1960s. Items attributed to the hoard are currently in the collections of the [[Metropolitan Museum]] in New York, the [[Louvre]] in Paris and the [[British Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search?ft=Ziwiye Metropolitan Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=rs_display_res&amp;critere=Ziwiye&amp;operator=OR&amp;nbToDisplay=5&amp;langue=en&amp;x=22&amp;y=16 Louvre Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=33588&amp;plaA=33588-3-1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The archaeologist [[Oscar White Muscarella]] has questioned the whole account of the finding of the hoard (as he has done with the older [[Oxus Treasure]]), pointing out that none of the items were excavated under archaeological conditions, but passed through the hands of dealers. He concludes that "there are no objective sources of information that any of the attributed objects actually were found at Ziwiye, although it is probable that some were", and that the objects have no historical and archaeological value as a group",&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella (1977), 955&lt;/ref&gt; although many are genuine and "exquisite works of art".&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella (1977), 992&lt;/ref&gt;  In a later work Muscarella denounced several "Ziwiye" objects as modern forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella (2000), 76-81&lt;/ref&gt;
