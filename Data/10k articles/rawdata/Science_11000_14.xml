The '''acoustic contrast factor''' is a number used to describe the relationship between the [[density|densities]] and the [[Sound speed|sound velocities]] (or, equivalently because of the form of the expression, the densities and [[compressibility|compressibilities]]) of two media. It is most often used in the context of [[biomedical]] [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonic imaging]] techniques using [[acoustics|acoustic]] contrast agents and in the field of ultrasonic manipulation of particles much smaller than the [[wavelength]] using ultrasonic standing waves. In the latter context, the acoustic contrast factor is the number which, depending on its sign, tells whether a given type of particle in a given medium will be attracted to the [[pressure]] [[Node (physics)|nodes]] or [[anti-node]]s.

==Example - particle in a medium==
Given the compressibilities &lt;math&gt;\beta_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_p&lt;/math&gt; and densities &lt;math&gt;\rho_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_p&lt;/math&gt; of the medium and particle, respectively, the acoustic contrast factor &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi = {\frac{5\rho_p-2\rho_m}{2\rho_p+\rho_m}}-{\frac{\beta_p}{\beta_m}}
&lt;/math&gt;

For a positive value of &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt;, the particles will be attracted to the pressure nodes, and vice versa.

Acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment.&lt;ref name=Hutchinson2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Efficacy --&gt;
The conclusions of many trials and numerous [[systematic review]]s of acupuncture are largely inconsistent, which suggests that it is not effective.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ernst2009/&gt; An overview of [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane reviews]] found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions.&lt;ref name=Ernst2009/&gt; A systematic review found little evidence of acupuncture's effectiveness in treating pain.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt; The evidence suggests that short-term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long-term benefits.&lt;ref name=Wang-2008/&gt; Some research results suggest acupuncture can alleviate pain, though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture's effects are mainly due to the [[Placebo|placebo effect]].&lt;ref name=Ernst2006/&gt; A systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias.&lt;ref name=Madsen2009/&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was [[cost-effective]] as an adjunct to standard care,&lt;ref name="Taylor2013"/&gt; while a systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain.&lt;ref name="Standaert2011"/&gt;

Acupuncture is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner using clean needle technique and single-use needles.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nciacupuncture"/&gt; When properly delivered, it has a low rate of mostly minor [[adverse effects]].&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect of the practitioner.&lt;ref name="nciacupuncture"/&gt; A review stated that the reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the previous decade.&lt;ref name="Gnatta2013"/&gt; The most frequently reported adverse events were [[pneumothorax]] and infections.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt; Since serious adverse events continue to be reported, it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Mechanism, Epidemiology and History --&gt;
Scientific investigation has not found any [[histology|histological]] or [[physiology|physiological]] evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as ''[[qi]]'', [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]], and acupuncture points,{{refn |group= n |name="SinghErnst2008" |Singh &amp; Ernst (2008) stated, "Scientists are still unable to find a shred of evidence to support the existence of meridians or Ch'i",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh &amp; Ernst|2008|page= 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The traditional principles of acupuncture are deeply flawed, as there is no evidence at all to demonstrate the existence of Ch'i or meridians"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh &amp; Ernst|2008|page= 107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "As yin and yang, acupuncture points and meridians are not a reality, but merely the product of an ancient Chinese philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh &amp; Ernst|2008|page= 387}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Ahn2008"/&gt; and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy (''qi'') flowing through meridians, which was a major part of early belief systems.&lt;ref name="Peñas2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mann2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams2013/&gt; Acupuncture is believed to have originated around 100&amp;nbsp;BC in China, around the time ''The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine'' ([[Huangdi Neijing]]) was published,&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; though some experts suggest it could have been practiced earlier.&lt;ref name="Ernst2006"/&gt; Over time, conflicting claims and belief systems emerged about the effect of lunar, celestial and earthly cycles, [[yin and yang]] energies, and a body's "rhythm" on the effectiveness of treatment.&lt;ref name="Prioreschi2004"/&gt; Acupuncture grew and diminished in popularity in China repeatedly, depending on the country's political leadership and the favor of rationalism or Western medicine.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; Acupuncture spread first to Korea in the 6th century AD, then to Japan through medical missionaries,&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; and then to Europe, starting with France.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; In the 20th century, as it spread to the United States and Western countries, the spiritual elements of acupuncture that conflict with Western beliefs were sometimes abandoned in favor of simply tapping needles into acupuncture points.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;&lt;ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson 2011 p. 610"/&gt;

Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=Berman2010/&gt; It is used most commonly for pain relief,&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCCAM2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Acupuncture for Pain|url=http://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/acupuncture-for-pain.htm|work=NCCIH|access-date=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is also used to treat a wide range of conditions. The majority of people who seek out acupuncture do so for musculoskeletal problems, including [[low back pain]], shoulder stiffness, and knee pain.&lt;ref name=Ishizaki2010/&gt; Acupuncture is generally only used in combination with other forms of treatment.&lt;ref name=Hutchinson2012/&gt; For example, [[American Society of Anesthesiologists]] states it may be considered in the treatment for nonspecific, noninflammatory low back pain only in conjunction with conventional therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benzon HT, Connis RT, De Leon-Casasola OA, Glass DD, Korevaar WC, Cynwyd B, Mekhail NA, Merrill DG, Nickinovich DG, Rathmell JP, Sang CN, Simon DL | title = Practice guidelines for chronic pain management: an updated report by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Chronic Pain Management and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 112 | issue = 4 | pages = 810–33 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20124882 | doi = 10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181c43103 | url = http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/article.aspx?articleid=1932775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acupuncture is the insertion of thin needles into the skin.&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt; According to the [[Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research]] (Mayo Clinic), a typical session entails lying still while approximately five to twenty needles are inserted; for the majority of cases, the needles will be left in place for ten to twenty minutes.&lt;ref name=mayo2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/acupuncture/basics/what-you-can-expect/prc-20020778|work=Mayo Clinic Staff|publisher=[[Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research]]|title=What you can expect|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be associated with the application of heat, pressure, or [[laser light]].&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt; Classically, acupuncture is individualized and based on philosophy and intuition, and not on scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schwartz | first=L | url=http://medicalacupuncture.org/aama_marf/journal/vol12_1/evidence.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011121060240/http://medicalacupuncture.org/aama_marf/journal/vol12_1/evidence.html|archive-date=2001-11-21 |journal=Medical Acupuncture | pages=38–41 | year=2000 |volume=12 | issue=1 | title=Evidence-Based Medicine And Traditional Chinese Medicine: Not Mutually Exclusive}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a [[invasiveness of surgical procedures#Non-invasive procedure|non-invasive]] therapy developed in early 20th century Japan using an elaborate set of "needles" for the treatment of children (''shōnishin'' or ''shōnihari'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Stephen | last = Birch | name-list-format = vanc |chapter= |pages= |title=Japanese Pediatric Acupuncture|publisher=Thieme |year=2011 |isbn=978-3131500618}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Thomas | last = Wernicke | name-list-format = vanc |chapter= |pages= |title=The Art of Non-Invasive Paediatric Acupuncture|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers |year=2014 |isbn=978-1848191600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional acupuncture, the acupuncturist decides which points to treat by observing and questioning the patient to make a diagnosis according to the tradition used. In TCM, the four diagnostic methods are: inspection, auscultation and olfaction, inquiring, and palpation. Inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue, including analysis of the tongue size, shape, tension, color and coating, and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge.&lt;ref name=Cheng1987/&gt; Auscultation and olfaction involve listening for particular sounds such as wheezing, and observing body odor.&lt;ref name=Cheng1987/&gt; Inquiring involves focusing on the "seven inquiries": chills and fever; perspiration; appetite, thirst and taste; defecation and urination; pain; sleep; and [[menses]] and [[leukorrhea]].&lt;ref name=Cheng1987/&gt; Palpation is focusing on feeling the body for tender ''"A-shi"'' points and feeling the pulse.&lt;ref name=Cheng1987&gt;[[#Cheng1987|Cheng]], 1987, chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Needles ===
[[File:Acupuncture Needles.jpg|thumb|right|Acupuncture needles]]
[[File:Japanese kudabari.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional and modern Japanese guiding tube needles]]
The most common mechanism of stimulation of acupuncture points employs penetration of the skin by thin metal needles, which are manipulated manually or the needle may be further stimulated by electrical stimulation (electroacupuncture).&lt;ref name=Berman2010/&gt; Acupuncture needles are typically made of stainless steel, making them flexible and preventing them from rusting or breaking.&lt;ref name=Hicks2005/&gt; Needles are usually disposed of after each use to prevent contamination.&lt;ref name=Hicks2005/&gt; Reusable needles when used should be sterilized between applications.&lt;ref name=Hicks2005&gt;{{cite book | first = Angela | last = Hicks | name-list-format = vanc |edition=1 |page=41 |title=The Acupuncture Handbook: How Acupuncture Works and How It Can Help You |publisher=[[Piatkus Books]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0749924720}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Collinge | first = William J. | name-list-format = vanc |title=The American Holistic Health Association Complete guide to alternative medicine |publisher=Warner Books |location=New York |year=1996 |isbn=0-446-67258-0 |oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needles vary in length between {{convert|13|to|130|mm|in}}, with shorter needles used near the face and eyes, and longer needles in areas with thicker tissues; needle diameters vary from 0{{convert|.16|mm|3|abbr=on}} to 0{{convert|.46|mm|3|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=Aung116&gt;[[#Aung2007|Aung &amp; Chen]], 2007, p.

Apart from the usual filiform needle, other needle types include three-edged needles and the Nine Ancient Needles.&lt;ref name=Aung116/&gt; Japanese acupuncturists use extremely thin needles that are used superficially, sometimes without penetrating the skin, and surrounded by a guide tube (a 17th-century invention adopted in China and the West).

=== Needling technique ===

==== Insertion ====

The skin is sterilized and needles are inserted, frequently with a plastic guide tube. Needles may be manipulated in various ways, including spinning, flicking, or moving up and down relative to the skin. Since most pain is felt in the superficial layers of the skin, a quick insertion of the needle is recommended.&lt;ref name=Aung2007&gt;[[#Aung2007|Aung &amp; Chen]], 2007, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 113–114].&lt;/ref&gt; Often the needles are stimulated by hand in order to cause a dull, localized, aching sensation that is called ''de qi'', as well as "needle grasp," a tugging feeling felt by the acupuncturist and generated by a mechanical interaction between the needle and skin.&lt;ref name=Berman2010/&gt; Acupuncture can be painful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loyeung BY, Cobbin DM | title = Investigating the effects of three needling parameters (manipulation, retention time, and insertion site) on needling sensation and pain profiles: a study of eight deep needling interventions | journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 2013 | pages = 136763 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24159337 | pmc = 3789497 | doi = 10.1155/2013/136763 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The skill level of the acupuncturist may influence how painful the needle insertion is, and a sufficiently skilled practitioner may be able to insert the needles without causing any pain.&lt;ref name=Aung2007/&gt;

==== ''De-qi'' sensation ====

''De-qi'' ({{zh|s=得气|p=dé qì}}; "arrival of qi") refers to a sensation of [[paresthesia|numbness]], distension, or electrical tingling at the needling site which might radiate along the corresponding [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridian]]. If ''de-qi'' can not be generated, then inaccurate location of the [[acupoint]], improper depth of needle insertion, inadequate manual manipulation, or a very weak constitution of the patient can be considered, all of which are thought to decrease the likelihood of successful treatment. If the ''de-qi'' sensation does not immediately occur upon needle insertion, various manual manipulation techniques can be applied to promote it (such as "plucking", "shaking" or "trembling").&lt;ref name="AungChen2007"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Steven | last1 = Aung | first2 = William | last2 = Chen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Clinical Introduction to Medical Acupuncture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC|access-date=20 September 2012|date=10 January 2007|publisher=Thieme|isbn=9781588902214|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once ''de-qi'' is achieved, further techniques might be utilized which aim to "influence" the ''de-qi''; for example, by certain manipulation the ''de-qi'' sensation allegedly can be conducted from the needling site towards more distant sites of the body.&lt;!---is this threading?---&gt; Other techniques aim at "tonifying" ({{zh|s=补|p=bǔ}}) or "sedating" ({{zh|s=泄|p=xiè}}) ''qi''.&lt;ref name="AungChen2007"/&gt; The former techniques are used in [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Basic principles of pattern discrimination|deficiency]] patterns, the latter in excess patterns.&lt;ref name="AungChen2007"/&gt; ''De qi'' is more important in Chinese acupuncture, while Western and Japanese patients may not consider it a necessary part of the treatment.&lt;ref name=Dummies/&gt;

==== Pain ====

The conclusions of many trials and numerous [[systematic review]]s of acupuncture are largely inconsistent with each other.&lt;ref name=Ernst2009/&gt; A 2011 systematic review of systematic reviews found that for reducing pain, real acupuncture was no better than sham acupuncture, and concluded that numerous reviews have shown little convincing evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment for reducing pain.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"/&gt; The same review found that neck pain was one of only four types of pain for which a positive effect was suggested, but cautioned that the primary studies used carried a considerable risk of bias.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ernst E, Lee MS, Choi TY | title = Acupuncture: does it alleviate pain and are there serious risks?

=== Moxibustion and cupping ===
&lt;!-- Traditional acupuncture involves moxibustion and cupping. --&gt;
A 2010 overview of systematic reviews found that moxibustion was effective for several conditions but the primary studies were of poor quality, so there persists ample uncertainty, which limits the conclusiveness of their findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee MS, Kang JW, Ernst E | title = Does moxibustion work?

==== English-language ====

A 2013 systematic review of the English-language case reports found that serious adverse events associated with acupuncture are rare, but that acupuncture is not without risk.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; Between 2000 and 2011 the English-language literature from 25 countries and regions reported 294 adverse events.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; The majority of the reported adverse events were relatively minor, and the incidences were low.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; For example, a prospective survey of 34,000 acupuncture treatments found no serious adverse events and 43 minor ones, a rate of 1.3 per 1000 interventions.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; Another survey found there were 7.1% minor adverse events, of which 5 were serious, amid 97,733 acupuncture patients.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; The most common adverse effect observed was infection (e.g. mycobacterium), and the majority of infections were bacterial in nature, caused by skin contact at the needling site.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; Infection has also resulted from skin contact with unsterilized equipment or with dirty towels in an unhygienic clinical setting.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; Other adverse complications included five reported cases of [[spinal cord injuries]] (e.g. migrating broken needles or needling too deeply), four brain injuries, four peripheral nerve injuries, five [[heart]] injuries, seven other organ and tissue injuries, bilateral hand [[edema]], [[granuloma|epithelioid granuloma]], [[pseudolymphoma]], [[argyria]], pustules, [[pancytopenia]], and scarring due to hot-needle technique.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; Adverse reactions from acupuncture, which are unusual and uncommon in typical acupuncture practice, included syncope, galactorrhoea, bilateral nystagmus, pyoderma gangrenosum, hepatotoxicity, eruptive lichen planus, and spontaneous needle migration.&lt;ref name="Xu S"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu S, Wang L, Cooper E, Zhang M, Manheimer E, Berman B, Shen X, Lao L | title = Adverse events of acupuncture: a systematic review of case reports | journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 2013 | pages = 581203 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23573135 | pmc = 3616356 | doi = 10.1155/2013/581203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 systematic review found 31 cases of vascular injuries caused by acupuncture, three resulting in death.&lt;ref name=Bergqvist/&gt; Two died from pericardial tamponade and one was from an aortoduodenal fistula.&lt;ref name=Bergqvist&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bergqvist D | title = Vascular injuries caused by acupuncture.

A 2012 review found a number of adverse events were reported after acupuncture in the UK's [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS) but most (95%) were not severe,&lt;ref name=Wheway2012/&gt; though miscategorization and under-reporting may alter the total figures.&lt;ref name=Wheway2012/&gt; From January 2009 to December 2011, 468 safety incidents were recognized within the NHS organizations.&lt;ref name=Wheway2012/&gt; The adverse events recorded included retained needles (31%), dizziness (30%), loss of consciousness/unresponsive (19%), falls (4%), bruising or soreness at needle site (2%), pneumothorax (1%) and other adverse side effects (12%).&lt;ref name=Wheway2012/&gt; Acupuncture practitioners should know, and be prepared to be responsible for, any substantial harm from treatments.&lt;ref name=Wheway2012/&gt; Some acupuncture proponents argue that the long history of acupuncture suggests it is safe.&lt;ref name=Wheway2012/&gt; However, there is an increasing literature on adverse events (e.g. spinal-cord injury).&lt;ref name=Wheway2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wheway J, Agbabiaka TB, Ernst E | title = Patient safety incidents from acupuncture treatments: a review of reports to the National Patient Safety Agency | journal = The International Journal of Risk &amp; Safety in Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 163–9 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22936058 | doi = 10.3233/JRS-2012-0569 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acupuncture seems to be safe in people getting [[anticoagulant]]s, assuming needles are used at the correct location and depth.&lt;ref name=Mcculloch2014/&gt; Studies are required to verify these findings.&lt;ref name="Mcculloch2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mcculloch M, Nachat A, Schwartz J, Casella-Gordon V, Cook J | title = Acupuncture safety in patients receiving anticoagulants: a systematic review | journal = The Permanente Journal | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 68–73 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25432001 | pmc = 4315381 | doi = 10.7812/TPP/14-057 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence suggests that acupuncture might be a safe option for people with allergic rhinitis.&lt;ref name=Feng2015/&gt;

==== Chinese, South Korean, and Japanese-language ====

A 2010 systematic review of the Chinese-language literature found numerous acupuncture-related adverse events, including pneumothorax, fainting, [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]], and infection as the most frequent, and cardiovascular injuries, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pneumothorax, and recurrent cerebral hemorrhage as the most serious, most of which were due to improper technique.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; Between 1980 and 2009, the Chinese-language literature reported 479 adverse events.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; [[Prospective survey]]s show that mild, transient acupuncture-associated adverse events ranged from 6.71% to 15%.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; In a study with 190,924 patients, the prevalence of serious adverse events was roughly 0.024%.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; Another study showed a rate of adverse events requiring specific treatment of 2.2%, 4,963 [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidences]] among 229,230 patients.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; Infections, mainly [[hepatitis]], after acupuncture are reported often in English-language research, though are rarely reported in Chinese-language research, making it plausible that acupuncture-associated infections have been underreported in China.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; Infections were mostly caused by poor sterilization of acupuncture needles.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; Other adverse events included spinal epidural hematoma (in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine), chylothorax, injuries of abdominal organs and tissues, injuries in the neck region, injuries to the eyes, including orbital hemorrhage, traumatic cataract, injury of the oculomotor nerve and retinal puncture, hemorrhage to the cheeks and the hypoglottis, peripheral motor-nerve injuries and subsequent motor dysfunction, local allergic reactions to metal needles, stroke, and cerebral hemorrhage after acupuncture.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt;

A causal link between acupuncture and the adverse events cardiac arrest, pyknolepsy, shock, fever, cough, thirst, aphonia, leg numbness, and sexual dysfunction remains uncertain.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang J, Shang H, Gao X, Ernst E | title = Acupuncture-related adverse events: a systematic review of the Chinese literature | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 88 | issue = 12 | pages = 915–921C | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21124716 | pmc = 2995190 | doi = 10.2471/BLT.10.076737 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same review concluded that acupuncture can be considered inherently safe when practiced by properly trained practitioners, but the review also stated there is a need to find effective strategies to minimize the health risks.&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; Between 1999 and 2010, the Republic of Korean-literature contained reports of 1104 adverse events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shin HK, Jeong SJ, Lee MS, Ernst E | title = Adverse events attributed to traditional Korean medical practices: 1999-2010 | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 91 | issue = 8 | pages = 569–75 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23940404 | pmc = 3738306 | doi = 10.2471/BLT.12.111609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1980s and 2002, the Japanese-language literature contained reports of 150 adverse events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamashita H, Tsukayama H | title = Safety of acupuncture practice in Japan: patient reactions, therapist negligence and error reduction strategies | journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 391–8 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18955234 | pmc = 2586322 | doi = 10.1093/ecam/nem086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Children and pregnancy ====

Although acupuncture has been practiced for thousands of years in China, its use in [[pediatrics]] in the United States did not become common until the early 2000s. In 2007, the [[National Health Interview Survey]] (NHIS) conducted by the [[National Center for Health Statistics|National Center For Health Statistics]] (NCHS) estimated that approximately 150,000 children had received acupuncture treatment for a variety of conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://nccih.nih.gov/sites/nccam.nih.gov/files/news/nhsr12.pdf |title = Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Adults and Children: United States, 2007 |date = 2008-12-10 |access-date = 2016-02-05 |website = National Center for Complimentary and Integrative Health |publisher = NCHS |last = Barnes |first = Patricia M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 a study determined that the use of acupuncture-needle treatment on children was "questionable" due to the possibility of adverse side-effects and the pain manifestation differences in children versus adults. The study also includes warnings against practicing acupuncture on infants, as well as on children who are over-fatigued, very weak, or have over-eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jindal V, Ge A, Mansky PJ | title = Safety and efficacy of acupuncture in children: a review of the evidence | journal = Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 431–42 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18525459 | pmc = 2518962 | doi = 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318165b2cc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used on children, acupuncture is considered safe when administered by well-trained, licensed practitioners using sterile needles; however, a 2011 review found there was limited research to draw definite conclusions about the overall safety of pediatric acupuncture.&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt; The same review found 279 adverse events, 25 of them serious.&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt; The adverse events were mostly mild in nature (e.g. bruising or bleeding).&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt; The prevalence of mild adverse events ranged from 10.1% to 13.5%, an estimated 168 incidences among 1,422 patients.&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt; On rare occasions adverse events were serious (e.g. [[cardiac rupture]] or [[hemoptysis]]); many might have been a result of substandard practice.&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adams D, Cheng F, Jou H, Aung S, Yasui Y, Vohra S | title = The safety of pediatric acupuncture: a systematic review | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 128 | issue = 6 | pages = e1575-87 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22106073 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2011-1091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence of serious adverse events was 5 per one million, which included children and adults.&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt;

When used during pregnancy, the majority of adverse events caused by acupuncture were mild and transient, with few serious adverse events.&lt;ref name="Park-2014"/&gt; The most frequent mild adverse event was needling or unspecified pain, followed by bleeding.&lt;ref name="Park-2014"/&gt; Although two deaths (one stillbirth and one neonatal death) were reported, there was a lack of acupuncture-associated maternal mortality.&lt;ref name="Park-2014"/&gt; Limiting the evidence as certain, probable or possible in the causality evaluation, the estimated incidence of adverse events following acupuncture in pregnant women was 131 per 10,000.&lt;ref name="Park-2014"&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Park J, Sohn Y, White AR, Lee H | title = The safety of acupuncture during pregnancy: a systematic review | journal = Acupuncture in Medicine | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 257–66 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24554789 | pmc = 4112450 | doi = 10.1136/acupmed-2013-010480 | type = Systematic review }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Although acupuncture is not contraindicated in pregnant women, some specific acupuncture points are particularly sensitive to needle insertion; these spots, as well as the [[abdomen|abdominal region]], should be avoided during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Berman2010"/&gt;

==== Moxibustion and cupping ====
&lt;!-- Traditional acupuncture involves moxibustion and cupping. --&gt;
Four adverse events associated with moxibustion were bruising, burns and cellulitis, spinal epidural abscess, and large superficial basal cell carcinoma.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; Ten adverse events were associated with cupping.&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; The minor ones were [[keloid]] scarring, burns, and [[bulla (dermatology)|bullae]];&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt; the serious ones were acquired hemophilia A, stroke following cupping on the back and neck, factitious [[panniculitis]], reversible cardiac hypertrophy, and [[iron deficiency anemia]].&lt;ref name="Xu S"/&gt;

=== Cost-effectiveness ===

A 2013 meta-analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was [[cost-effective]] as a complement to standard care, but not as a substitute for standard care except in cases where comorbid depression presented.&lt;ref name=Taylor2013/&gt; The same meta-analysis found there was no difference between sham and non-sham acupuncture.&lt;ref name=Taylor2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor P, Pezzullo L, Grant SJ, Bensoussan A | title = Cost-effectiveness of Acupuncture for Chronic Nonspecific Low Back Pain | journal = Pain Practice | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 599–606 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24138020 | doi = 10.1111/papr.12116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain.&lt;ref name=Standaert2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Standaert CJ, Friedly J, Erwin MW, Lee MJ, Rechtine G, Henrikson NB, Norvell DC | title = Comparative effectiveness of exercise, acupuncture, and spinal manipulation for low back pain | journal = Spine | volume = 36 | issue = 21 Suppl | pages = S120-30 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21952184 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1097/BRS.0b013e31822ef878 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 systematic review found that the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture could not be concluded.&lt;ref name=Hopton2010/&gt; A 2012 review found that acupuncture seems to be cost-effective for some pain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ambrósio EM, Bloor K, MacPherson H | title = Costs and consequences of acupuncture as a treatment for chronic pain: a systematic review of economic evaluations conducted alongside randomised controlled trials | journal = Complementary Therapies in Medicine | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 364–74 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22863652 | doi = 10.1016/j.ctim.2012.05.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In TCM, disease is generally perceived as a disharmony or imbalance in energies such as [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Yin and yang|yin, yang]], [[Traditional Chinese medicine#TCM model of the body|''qi'', xuĕ, zàng-fǔ, meridians]], and of the interaction between the body and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiseman &amp; Ellis|1996|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapy is based on which "pattern of disharmony" can be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Ergil MC, Ergil KV | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=kdZ1rFKW–LEC&amp;pg=PA19 19], [https://books.google.com/books?id=kdZ1rFKW–LEC&amp;pg=PA148 148] | title = Pocket Atlas of Chinese Medicine | year = 2009 | publisher = Thieme | location = Stuttgart | isbn = 9783131416117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Flaws B, Finney D | year = 2007 | title = A handbook of TCM patterns &amp; their treatments | edition = 6th | publisher = Blue Poppy Press | isbn = 9780936185705 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=iJT3mz20yHoC&amp;pg=PA1 1] }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some diseases are believed to be caused by meridians being invaded with an excess of wind, cold, and damp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Flaws B, Finney D | title = A handbook of TCM patterns &amp; their treatments | publisher = Blue Poppy Press | year = 1996 | edition = 6 (2007) |isbn = 9780936185705 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=iJT3mz20yHoC&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 169–173] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to determine which [[Traditional chinese medicine#Patterns|pattern]] is at hand, practitioners examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing, or the sound of the voice.&lt;ref name=Tongue&gt;{{cite book | title = Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine | last = Maciocia | first = G | publisher = Eastland Press | year = 1995 | isbn = 093961619X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maciocia&gt;{{Cite book | first = G | last = Maciocia | title = The Foundations of Chinese Medicine | publisher = Churchill Livingstone | year = 2005 | isbn = 0443074895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TCM and its concept of disease does not strongly differentiate between the cause and effect of symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=t23zKB1FSVYC&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 26]| last=Ross |first=J|title=Zang Fu, the organ systems of traditional Chinese medicine| publisher=Elsevier |year=1984 | isbn=9780443034824 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article in ''Rheumatology'', the first documentation of an "organized system of diagnosis and treatment" for acupuncture was in ''The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine'' ([[Huangdi Neijing]]) from about 100&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; Gold and silver needles found in the tomb of [[Liu Sheng, Prince of Zhongshan|Liu Sheng]] from around 100&amp;nbsp;BC are believed to be the earliest archeological evidence of acupuncture, though it is unclear if that was their purpose.&lt;ref name=Ramey&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramey D, Buell D | year = 2004 | title = A true history of acupuncture | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1211/fact.2004.00244/full | doi = 10.1211/fact.2004.00244 | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | journal = Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies | pages = 269–273|trans-title=2017-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Plinio Prioreschi, the earliest known historical record of acupuncture is the [[Shih-Chi]] ("Record of History"), written by a historian around 100&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="Prioreschi2004"/&gt; It is believed that this text was documenting what was established practice at that time.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;

====Alternate theories====
The 5,000-year-old mummified body of [[Ötzi the Iceman]] was found with 15 groups of tattoos,&lt;ref name=Dorfer-1999/&gt; many of which were located at points on the body where acupuncture needles are used for abdominal or lower back problems. Evidence from the body suggests Otzi suffered from these conditions.&lt;ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/&gt; This has been cited as evidence that practices similar to acupuncture may have been practiced elsewhere in [[Eurasia]] during the early [[Bronze Age]];&lt;ref name=Dorfer-1999&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dorfer L, Moser M, Bahr F, Spindler K, Egarter-Vigl E, Giullén S, Dohr G, Kenner T | title = A medical report from the stone age? | journal = Lancet | volume = 354 | issue = 9183 | pages = 1023–5 | date = September 1999 | pmid = 10501382 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(98)12242-0 | url = http://www.utexas.edu/courses/classicalarch/readings/Iceman_Tattoos.pdf | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/5siE6P6TM?url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/classicalarch/readings/Iceman_Tattoos.pdf | archive-date = 2010-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, ''The Oxford Handbook of the History of Medicine'' calls this theory "speculative".&lt;ref name="Jackson 2011 p. 610"&gt;{{cite book | last=Jackson | first=M. | title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Medicine | publisher=OUP Oxford | series=Oxford Handbooks in History | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-19-954649-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpjgoazGIC4C&amp;pg=PT610 | access-date=14 July 2015 | page=610}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered unlikely that acupuncture was practiced before 2000&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Ramey/&gt; The Ötzi the Iceman's tattoo marks suggest to some experts that an acupuncture-like treatment was previously used in Europe 5 millennia ago.&lt;ref name="Ernst2006"/&gt;

Acupuncture may have been practiced during the [[Neolithic]] era, near the end of the [[stone age]], using sharpened stones called [[Bian Stones|Bian shi]].&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|70}} Many Chinese texts from later eras refer to sharp stones called "plen", which means "stone probe", that may have been used for acupuncture purposes.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|70}} The ancient Chinese medical text, Huangdi Neijing, indicates that sharp stones were believed at-the-time to cure illnesses at or near the body's surface, perhaps because of the short depth a stone could penetrate.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|71}} However, it is more likely that stones were used for other medical purposes, such as puncturing a growth to drain its [[pus]].&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;&lt;ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/&gt; The ''[[Mawangdui]]'' texts, which are believed to be from the 2nd century BC, mention the use of pointed stones to open [[abscess]]es, and moxibustion, but not for acupuncture.&lt;ref name="Prioreschi2004"/&gt; It is also speculated that these stones may have been used for bloodletting, due to the ancient Chinese belief that illnesses were caused by demons within the body that could be killed or released.&lt;ref name="Singh Ernst 2008 p. 42"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Singh S, Ernst E | title=Trick Or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine | publisher=W.

According to historians [[Lu Gwei-djen]] and [[Joseph Needham]], there is substantial evidence that acupuncture may have begun around 600&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; Some hieroglyphs and [[Pictogram|pictographs]] from that era suggests acupuncture and moxibustion were practiced.&lt;ref name="Robson"&gt;{{cite book | last = Robson | first = T | title = An Introduction to Complementary Medicine | isbn = 1741140544 | year = 2004 | publisher = [[Allen &amp; Unwin]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E6oa37ZyTxEC&amp;pg=PA90 | page = 90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians Gwei-djen and Needham said it was unlikely a needle could be made out of the materials available in China during this time period.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|71-72}} It is possible that [[Bronze|bronze]] was used for early acupuncture needles. Tin, copper, gold and silver are also possibilities, though they are considered less likely, or to have been used in fewer cases.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|69}} If acupuncture was practiced during the [[Shang dynasty]] (1766 to 1122&amp;nbsp;BC), organic materials like thorns, sharpened bones, or bamboo may have been used.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|70}} Once methods for producing steel were discovered, it would replace all other materials, since it could be used to create a very fine, but sturdy needles.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|74}} Gwei-djen and Needham noted that all the ancient materials that could have been used for acupuncture and which often produce archeological evidence, such as sharpened bones, bamboo or stones, were also used for other purposes.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; An article in ''Rheumatology'' said that the absence of any mention of acupuncture in documents found in the tomb of Ma-Wang-Dui from 198&amp;nbsp;BC suggest that acupuncture was not practiced by that time.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;

====Belief systems====
Several different and sometimes conflicting belief systems emerged regarding acupuncture. This may have been the result of competing schools of thought.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; Some ancient texts referred to using acupuncture to cause bleeding, while others mixed the ideas of blood-letting and spiritual ch'i energy. Over time, the focus shifted from blood to the concept of puncturing specific points on the body, and eventually to balancing Yin and Yang energies as well.&lt;ref name="Prioreschi2004"/&gt; According to David Ramey, no single "method or theory" was ever predominantly adopted as the standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramey DW | title = Inaccurate acupuncture history | journal = Rheumatology | volume = 43 | issue = 12 | pages = 1593; author reply 1593–4 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15564643 | doi = 10.1093/rheumatology/keh363 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, scientific knowledge of medicine was not yet developed, especially because in China dissection of the deceased was forbidden, preventing the development of basic anatomical knowledge.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;

It is not certain when specific acupuncture points were introduced, but the autobiography of Pien Chhio from around 400–500&amp;nbsp;BC references inserting needles at designated areas.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; [[Bian Que]] believed there was a single acupuncture point at the top of one's skull that he called the point "of the hundred meetings."&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|83}} Texts dated to be from 156–186&amp;nbsp;BC document early beliefs in channels of life force energy called meridians that would later be an element in early acupuncture beliefs.&lt;ref name=Ramey/&gt;

Ramey and Buell said the "practice and theoretical underpinnings" of modern acupuncture were introduced in ''The Yellow Emperor's Classic'' (Huangdi Neijing) around 100&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Prioreschi2004&gt;{{cite book | last = Prioreschi | first = P | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=MJUMhEYGOKsC&amp;pg=PA147 147–148] | year = 2004 | isbn = 1888456019 | publisher = Horatius Press | title = A history of Medicine, Volume 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ramey/&gt; It introduced the concept of using acupuncture to manipulate the flow of life energy (''qi'') in a network of meridian (channels) in the body.&lt;ref name=Ramey/&gt;&lt;ref name="Epler"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Epler DC | title = Bloodletting in early Chinese medicine and its relation to the origin of acupuncture | journal = Bulletin of the History of Medicine | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 337–67 | year = 1980 | pmid = 6998524 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The network concept was made up of acu-tracts, such as a line down the arms, where it said acupoints were located. Some of the sites acupuncturists use needles at today still have the same names as those given to them by the ''Yellow Emperor's Classic''.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|93}} Numerous additional documents were published over the centuries introducing new acupoints.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|101}} By the 4th century AD, most of the acupuncture sites in use today had been named and identified.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|101}}

===Early development in China===

====Establishment and growth====
In the first half of the 1st century AD, acupuncturists began promoting the belief that acupuncture's effectiveness was influenced by the time of day or night, the lunar cycle, and the season.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|140-141}} The Science of the Yin-Yang Cycles (''Yün Chhi Hsüeh'') was a set of beliefs that curing diseases relied on the alignment of both heavenly (thien) and earthly (ti) forces that were attuned to cycles like that of the sun and moon.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|140-141}} There were several different belief systems that relied on a number of celestial and earthly bodies or elements that rotated and only became aligned at certain times.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|140-141}} According to Needham and Gwei-djen, these "arbitrary predictions" were depicted by acupuncturists in complex charts and through a set of special terminology.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

Acupuncture needles during this period were much thicker than most modern ones and often resulted in infection. Infection is caused by a lack of sterilization, but at that time it was believed to be caused by use of the wrong needle, or needling in the wrong place, or at the wrong time.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|102-103}} Later, many needles were heated in boiling water, or in a flame. Sometimes needles were used while they were still hot, creating a [[cauterizing]] effect at the injection site.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|104}} Nine needles were recommended in the ''Chen Chiu Ta Chheng'' from 1601, which may have been because of an ancient Chinese belief that nine was a magic number.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|102-103}}

Other belief systems were based on the idea that the human body operated on a rhythm and acupuncture had to be applied at the right point in the rhythm to be effective.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|140-141}} In some cases a lack of balance between Yin and Yang were believed to be the cause of disease.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|140-141}}

In the 1st century AD, many of the first books about acupuncture were published and recognized acupuncturist experts began to emerge. The ''Zhen Jiu Jia Yi Jing'', which was published in the mid-3rd century, became the oldest acupuncture book that is still in existence in the modern era.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; Other books like the ''Yu Kuei Chen Ching'', written by the Director of Medical Services for China, were also influential during this period, but were not preserved.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; In the mid 7th century, [[Sun Simiao]] published acupuncture-related diagrams and charts that established standardized methods for finding acupuncture sites on people of different sizes and categorized acupuncture sites in a set of modules.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

Acupuncture became more established in China as improvements in paper led to the publication of more acupuncture books. The Imperial Medical Service and the Imperial Medical College, which both supported acupuncture, became more established and created medical colleges in every province.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{rp|129}} The public was also exposed to stories about royal figures being cured of their diseases by prominent acupuncturists.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{rp|129–135}} By time ''The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion'' was published during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644&amp;nbsp;AD), most of the acupuncture practices used in the modern era had been established.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;

====Decline====
By the end of the Song dynasty (1279&amp;nbsp;AD), acupuncture had lost much of its status in China.&lt;ref name=Barnes2005&gt;[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA25 25].&lt;/ref&gt; It became rarer in the following centuries, and was associated with less prestigious professions like [[alchemy]], [[shamanism]], [[midwifery]] and moxibustion.&lt;ref name="Barnes 2005 p. 25"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes LL | title=Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848 | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-674-01872-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA25 | access-date=21 July 2015 | page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, by the 18th century, scientific rationality was becoming more popular than traditional superstitious beliefs.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; By 1757 a book documenting the history of Chinese medicine called acupuncture a "lost art".&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|160}} Its decline was attributed in part to the popularity of prescriptions and medications, as well as its association with the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA188 188].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1822, the Chinese Emperor signed a decree excluding the practice of acupuncture from the Imperial Medical Institute.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; He said it was unfit for practice by gentlemen-scholars.&lt;ref name="Barnes 2005 p. 308"/&gt; In China acupuncture was increasingly associated with lower-class, illiterate practitioners.&lt;ref name="Barnes 2005 p. 58"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes LL | title=Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848 | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-674-01872-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA58 | access-date=14 July 2015 | page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was restored for a time, but banned again in 1929 in favor of science-based Western medicine. Although acupuncture declined in China during this time period, it was also growing in popularity in other countries.&lt;ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/&gt;

===International expansion===

Korea is believed to be the first country in Asia that acupuncture spread to outside of China.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; Within Korea there is a legend that acupuncture was developed by emperor [[Dangun]], though it is more likely to have been brought into Korea from a Chinese colonial prefecture in 514&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|262-263}} Acupuncture use was commonplace in Korea by the 6th century. It spread to Vietnam in the 8th and 9th centuries.&lt;ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/&gt; As Vietnam began trading with Japan and China around the 9th century, it was influenced by their acupuncture practices as well.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; China and Korea sent "medical missionaries" that spread traditional Chinese medicine to Japan, starting around 219&amp;nbsp;AD. In 553, several Korean and Chinese citizens were appointed to re-organize medical education in Japan and they incorporated acupuncture as part of that system.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|264}} Japan later sent students back to China and established acupuncture as one of five divisions of the Chinese State Medical Administration System.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|264-265}}

Acupuncture began to spread to Europe in the second half of the 17th century. Around this time the surgeon-general of the [[Dutch East India Company]] met Japanese and Chinese acupuncture practitioners and later encouraged Europeans to further investigate it.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;{{RP|264-265}} He published the first in-depth description of acupuncture for the European audience and created the term "acupuncture" in his 1683 work ''De Acupunctura''.&lt;ref name="Singh Ernst 2008 p. 42"/&gt; France was an early adopter among the West due to the influence of Jesuit missionaries, who brought the practice to French clinics in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; The French doctor Louis Berlioz (the father of the composer [[Hector Berlioz]]) is usually credited with being the first to experiment with the procedure in Europe in 1810, before publishing his findings in 1816.&lt;ref name="Barnes 2005 p. 308"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes LL | title=Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848 | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-674-01872-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA308 | access-date=21 July 2015 | page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, acupuncture had become commonplace in many areas of the world.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{RP|295}} Americans and Britons began showing interest in acupuncture in the early 19th century but interest waned by mid century.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; Western practitioners abandoned acupuncture's traditional beliefs in spiritual energy, [[pulse diagnosis]], and the cycles of the moon, sun or the body's rhythm. Diagrams of the flow of spiritual energy, for example, conflicted with the West's own anatomical diagrams. It adopted a new set of ideas for acupuncture based on tapping needles into nerves.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;&lt;ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson 2011 p. 610"/&gt; In Europe it was speculated that acupuncture may allow or prevent the flow of electricity in the body, as electrical pulses were found to make a frog's leg twitch after death.&lt;ref name="Singh Ernst 2008 p. 42"/&gt;

The West eventually created a belief system based on Travell trigger points that were believed to inhibit pain. They were in the same locations as China's spiritually identified acupuncture points, but under a different nomenclature.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; The first elaborate Western treatise on acupuncture was published in 1683 by [[Willem ten Rhijne]].&lt;ref name="Barnes 2005 p. 75"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes LL | title=Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848 | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-674-01872-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA75 | access-date=14 July 2015 | page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Modern era ====

In China, the popularity of acupuncture rebounded in 1949 when [[Mao Zedong]] took power and sought to unite China behind traditional cultural values. It was also during this time that many Eastern medical practices were consolidated under the name traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).&lt;ref name="Porter 2013 p. 403"/&gt;

New practices were adopted in the 20th century, such as using a cluster of needles,&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{RP|164}} electrified needles, or leaving needles inserted for up to a week.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{RP|164}} A lot of emphasis developed on using acupuncture on the ear.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{RP|164}} Acupuncture research organizations were founded in the 1950s and acupuncture services became available in modern hospitals.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; China, where acupuncture was believed to have originated, was increasingly influenced by Western medicine.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; Meanwhile, acupuncture grew in popularity in the US. The US Congress created the Office of Alternative Medicine in 1992 and the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) declared support for acupuncture for some conditions in November 1997. In 1999, the [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health|National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] was created within the NIH. Acupuncture became the most popular alternative medicine in the US.&lt;ref name=Wang2008/&gt;

Politicians from the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] said acupuncture was superstitious and conflicted with the party's commitment to science.&lt;ref name=Crozier1968/&gt; Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong later reversed this position,&lt;ref name=Crozier1968&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Crozier RC |title= Traditional medicine in modern China: science, nationalism, and the tensions of cultural change |edition=1 |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |location= Cambridge |year=1968 |isbn=978-0674901056 |oclc= }}{{Page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that the practice was based on scientific principles.&lt;ref name=Taylor2011&gt;{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=K | title=Chinese Medicine in Early Communist China, 1945–63: a Medicine of Revolution | year=2005 | isbn=041534512X | publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, a ''New York Times'' reporter published an article on his acupuncture experiences in China, which led to more investigation of and support for acupuncture.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; The US President [[1972 Nixon visit to China|Richard Nixon visited China in 1972]].&lt;ref name="CSICOP"/&gt; During one part of the visit, the delegation was shown a patient undergoing major surgery while fully awake, ostensibly receiving acupuncture rather than [[anesthesia]].&lt;ref name="CSICOP"/&gt; Later it was found that the patients selected for the surgery had both a high [[pain tolerance]] and received heavy indoctrination before the operation; these demonstration cases were also frequently receiving [[morphine]] surreptitiously through an [[intravenous therapy|intravenous drip]] that observers were told contained only fluids and nutrients.&lt;ref name="CSICOP"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/china_conference_1/ |title=Traditional Medicine and Pseudoscience in China: A Report of the Second CSICOP Delegation (Part 1) | vauthors = Beyerstein BL, Sampson W |volume=20 |issue=4 |year=1996 |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004020227/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/china_conference_1/ |archive-date=4 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One patient receiving [[open heart surgery]] while awake was ultimately found to have received a combination of three powerful sedatives as well as large injections of a [[local anesthetic]] into the wound.&lt;ref name=Colquhoun2013/&gt; After the [[National Institute of Health]] expressed support for acupuncture for a limited number of conditions, adoption in the US grew further.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; In 1972 the first legal acupuncture center in the US was established in Washington DC&lt;ref name="JCIM_Lee"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jcimjournal.com/en/index.aspx/ |title=The first acupuncture center in the United States: an interview with Yao Wu Lee, Washington Acupuncture Center |first=AY |last=Fan |volume=20 |issue=5 |year=2012 |journal=[[Journal of Integrative Medicine]] |publisher=Committee for Journal of Chinese Integrative Medicine |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727004846/http://www.jcimjournal.com/en/index.aspx |archive-date=27 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973 the American [[Internal Revenue Service]] allowed acupuncture to be deducted as a medical expense.&lt;ref name="'70s 133"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York City|isbn= 0465041957|page= 133|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
{{Main|Regulation of acupuncture}}
There are various government and trade association regulatory bodies for acupuncture in the United Kingdom, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Japan, Canada, and in European countries and elsewhere. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends that before being licensed or certified, an acupuncturist receive 200 hours of specialized training if they are a physician and 2,500 hours for non-physicians; many governments have adopted similar standards.&lt;ref name="PybusCairns2004"/&gt;

In China, the practice of acupuncture is regulated by the Chinese Medicine Council that was formed in 1999 by the Legislative Council. It includes a licensing exam and registration, as well as degree courses approved by the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong's traditional Chinese medicine laws 'putting public at risk'|date=23 July 2007|first=Mark|last=O'Neill|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/601500/hong-kongs-traditional-chinese-medicine-laws-putting-public-risk|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has acupuncture licensing programs in the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta and Quebec; standards set by the Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Association of Canada are used in provinces without government regulation.&lt;ref name="Ramsay2009"&gt;{{cite book| first = Cynthia | last = Ramsay | name-list-format = vanc |title=Unnatural Regulation: Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Y5oPvK4QVwC&amp;pg=PA43|year=2009|publisher=The Fraser Institute|page=43|id=GGKEY:0KK0XUSQASK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation in the US began in the 1970s&lt;ref name="Bauer2011"&gt;{{cite book| first = Matthew | last = Bauer | name-list-format = vanc |title=Making Acupuncture Pay: Real-World Advice for Successful Private Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=14gC5MErex4C&amp;pg=PA42|date=1 April 2011|publisher=Dog Ear Publishing|isbn=978-1-4575-0279-8|pages=42–}}&lt;/ref&gt; in California, which was eventually followed by every state but Wyoming and Idaho.&lt;ref name="PybusCairns2004"&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Beverly E. | last1 = Pybus | first2 = Carol S. | last2 = Cairns | name-list-format = vanc | title=A Guide to AHP Credentialing: Challenges and Opportunities to Credentialing Allied Health Professionals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e8ra8ix2pzUC&amp;pg=PA178|date=1 January 2004|publisher=HCPro|isbn=978-1-57839-478-4|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChanLee2001"/&gt; Licensing requirements vary greatly from state to state.

'''Adriaan Adriaanszoon''', called '''Metius''', (9 December 1571 – 6 September 1635), was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[geometry|geometer]] and [[astronomy|astronomer]] born in [[Alkmaar]]. The name "Metius" comes from the Dutch word ''meten'' ("measuring"), and therefore means something like "measurer" or "surveyor."

==Father and brother==
Adriaan Metius was born in [[Alkmaar]], [[North Holland]]. His father, Adriaan Anthonisz, was a [[mathematician]], [[Surveying|land-surveyor]], [[cartographer]], and [[military engineer]] who from 1582 served also as [[burgomaster]] of Alkmaar.

Metius' brother, [[Jacob Metius]], worked as an instrument-maker and a specialist in grinding [[Lens (optics)|lenses]]. Also born in Alkmaar, Jacob died between 1624 and 1631. Little is known of him besides the fact that, in October 1608, the [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|States General]] discussed his [[patent]] application for an [[optical telescope]] of his own invention described as a device for "seeing faraway things as though nearby", consisting of a convex and concave lens in a tube, and the combination magnified three or four times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/telescope.html galileo.rice.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Adriaan Metius attended a [[Latin]] school in Alkmaar and studied [[philosophy]] in 1589 at the recently founded [[University of Franeker]]. He continued his studies at [[Leiden]] in 1594, where he studied under [[Rudolph Snellius]]. He worked for a brief time under [[Tycho Brahe]] on the island of [[Hven]], where Brahe had built two observatories, and subsequently worked at [[Rostock]] and [[Jena]], where he gave lectures in 1595. Subsequently, he returned to Alkmaar and assisted his father for a time as a military engineer inspecting [[fortifications]], and also worked as a teacher of [[mathematics]] at [[Franeker]] in [[Frisia]], his teaching especially geared towards the training of surveyors.

At the [[University of Franeker]], he was appointed ''professor extraordinarius'' in 1598, and served from 1600 to 1635 as ''professor ordinarius'' of mathematics, [[navigation]], surveying, military engineering, and [[astronomy]]. He was permitted to teach in the vernacular instead of Latin. He served as rector of the university in 1603 and 1632.

With his father and brother he established an instrument making business which specialised in optical instruments. The family business seems to have manufactured the precision Jacob's staffs used by [[Tycho Brahe]] for his star sightings.

He died in Franeker.

Though he scoffed at [[astrology]], Metius is said to have spent a lot of time pursuing [[alchemy]], especially the [[philosophers' stone]].

Metius published treatises on the [[astrolabe]] and on [[surveying]]. His works include ''Arithmeticæ et geometriæ practica'' (1611), ''Institutiones Astronomicae Geographicae'', and ''Arithmeticæ libri duo: et geometriæ libri VI'' (1640). Metius also manufactured astronomical instruments and developed a special form of [[Jacob's staff]].

In 1585, his father had estimated the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, later called [[pi]], to be approximately {{sfrac|355|113}}. Metius later published his father's results, and the value {{sfrac|355|113}} is traditionally referred to as [[Milü|Metius' number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kr.cs.ait.ac.th/~radok/math/mat4/m41.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101013921/http://kr.cs.ait.ac.th/~radok/math/mat4/m41.htm |archivedate=2005-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[lunar crater]] [[Metius (crater)|Metius]] is named after him.

In [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer's]] painting ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'' (1668), the book lying on the table has been identified as a 1621 second edition of Metius's ''Institutiones Astronomicae Geographicae''. It is opened to Book III, where "inspiration from God" is recommended for astronomical research along with knowledge of [[geometry]] and the aid of mechanical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://essentialvermeer.20m.com/cat_about/astronomer.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1600">An '''Amorphism''', in [[chemistry]], [[crystallography]] and, by extension, to other areas of the natural sciences is a substance or feature that lacks an ordered form. In the specific case of crystallography, an amorphic material is one that lacks long range (significant) crystalline order at the [[molecular]] level. In the [[history of chemistry]], ''amorphism'' was recognised even before the discovery of the nature of the exact [[atom]]ic [[crystal structure|crystalline lattice structure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gmelin|1872}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of amorphism can also be found in the fields of art,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Weiss|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[biology]], [[archaeology]] and [[philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;Solovyof, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; as a characterisation of objects without form, or with [[Randomness|random]] or unstructured form.

'''Apertures''' are areas on the walls of a [[pollen]] grain, where the wall is thinner and/or softer. For germination it is necessary that the [[pollen tube]] can reach out from the inside of the pollen grain and transport the [[sperm]] to the egg deep down in the [[Carpel|pistil]]. The apertures are the places where the pollen tube is able to break through the (elsewhere very tough) pollen wall.

The number and configuration of apertures are often very exactly characteristic of different groups of plants. The biggest class of plant species, the [[Eudicots]], usually have three apertures in each pollen grain.

Mr. Nentwich was then managing editor of the [http://eiop.or.at/erpa/ European Research Papers Archive] (ERPA). ERPA was an Internet-based platform providing access to the papers of several research institutions focusing on European integration. ERPA featured only referred high quality series, featuring some form of refereeing, and the AEI was designed to complement ERPA by collecting research materials on European integration which did not necessarily meet ERPA's high quality standards. ERPA was archived on March 1, 2015.

In fall 2004, Barbara Sloan, then Head of Public Inquiries, [http://www.euintheus.org/ Delegation of the European Union to the United States], Washington, DC, (then the Delegation of the European Commission to the United States) began working with the AEI on digitizing and uploading EC/EU documents onto the AEI. The Delegation's EU library collection, founded in the mid-1950s, is by far the largest collection of EC/EU documentation in North America. A comprehensive guide to this collection can be found at European Union Archival Collection at the University of Pittsburgh, pp. 31-41. The Delegation donated this collection - spanning years early 1950s to 2004 - to the ULS in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Patricia Lomando|author2=Harvith, John|title=Pitt Library System to Receive Most Extensive Collection of Public European Community/EU Documents, Publications in North America|journal=Pitt Chronicle|date=29 May 2007|url=http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/?p=307|accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pitt to receive EU collection|journal=University Times|date=14 June 2007|volume=39|issue=20|url=http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=5927|accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EU gives library document collection|url=http://pittnews.com/newsstory/eu-gives-library-document-collection/|accessdate=31 July 2011|newspaper=The Pitt News|date=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection contains both a shelf section and a "research files" section. The latter consists of 650 linear shelf feet of mostly small working and staff documents arranged in folders by subject, and will provide thousands of hard to locate materials for digitization. There is a "finding aid" for the "research files" collection at [http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?type=simple;c=ascead;view=reslist;subview=standard;didno=US-PPiU-eudc Barbara Sloan European Union Document Collection]. 

The AEI immediately began using this collection as a source of documents to digitize and place onto the AEI. The goal was to complement the existing electronic collections on EU websites. The AEI Delegation collection contains two primary types of document formats: series and individual bound items in monographic form which most libraries would classify and place on shelves, and "internal working documents" which most libraries would not classify, making them more difficult to locate. At first the AEI, cognizant of the possibility that the EU itself might digitize large numbers of its older documents, took a conservative approach, digitizing mostly the internal working documents (COM docs) and staff working documents (SEC docs) and other select documents. Indeed, in 2009-2010 the EU did digitize and place on [https://bookshop.europa.eu/en/home/ EU Bookshop] over 2,000,000 pages of its bound documents.  

In 2011-2012 the AEI adopted a new, long-range policy regarding digitization, for several reasons. First, the AEI learned that it was unlikely that the EU would perform more large-scale digitization. Consequently, the AEI could develop a true "archive" where the goal would be to digitize as many documents as resources allowed. 

Second, the two EU websites containing the bulk of EC/EU documentation - EU Bookshop and [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html?locale=en Eur-Lex: Access to European Union Law] - contained only a portion of these documents. In EU Bookshop, many of the annuals and series there are not complete runs. Either they do not contain earlier documents from the 1950-60s, and/or volumes are missing throughout the run. Eur-Lex contains a considerable number of full text COM documents published 1990-2000 and nearly all 2001-present, but very few which were published before 1990. Despite their importance for research purposes, there is no comprehensive list of COM documents for the early years. Two indexes published 1976-1986 listed all COM docs, but there is no available written record which contains the titles of previous COM docs. The AEI Delegation collection contains nearly all of these documents which are missing from the EU Bookshop and Eur-Lex, which it will digitize.   

Third, navigating the EU Bookshop during large parts of the day is very slow, and much slower on older computers. In order to make documents easily available, the AEI decided to download annual and serial documents from the EU Bookshop and place them on the AEI, thereby furnishing full runs of all in one place. In most cases these runs will go from earliest volume up through 2000. It is likely all these runs will be completed sometime in 2017. Here are some examples ('''NOTE''': some annuals and serials have been only partially uploaded):

A '''Bachelor in Information Management (BIM)''' degree is an [[academic degree]] in Information technology requiring four years of study to acquire. This degree is a hybrid program with a mix of [[management]] and [[information technology]] courses with a focus on analytical, problem solving, decision-making and critical thinking skills.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uowdubai.ac.ae/computer-science-and-engineering-programs/bachelor-of-information-technology-in-management-information-systems-bit-mis-degree&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objective ==
* Prepare IT professionals proficient in the use of computers and computational techniques in order to develop effective information systems to solve real life problems in the organizational milieu.
* Develop students' skill in object-oriented software design methods and data management systems.
* Provide professional training to students by combining information technology with managerial skills.
* Prepare students to proceed on to post graduate level study in information management within and outside the country.
*Develop students' skill in object-oriented software design methods and data management systems.
Provide professional training to students by combining information technology with managerial skills.
*Prepare students to proceed on to post graduate level study in information management within and outside the country.

==Careers==
Graduating with a bachelors in Information Management highly beneficial as it opens up a plethora of career options and routes for students. This is manly due to the fact that employers now-a-days show a growing interest for applicants with both a business management education as well as an IT background. Paul Matthews from the Institute of IT Professionals stated that "Employers tell me the key thing holding them back is the ability to get skilled people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gifford|first1=Adam|title=Surge in demand for IT graduates|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10902070|website=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This degree would be beneficial as it is employable all over world. Every company has an IT department, which even in non-tech firms, play an essential role in the company's daily functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surfing a digital wave, or drowning?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21591201-information-technology-everywhere-companies-it-departments-mixed|website=The Economist|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fine combination of IT and management that this degree offers, has shown career prospects in fields such as:
* Software Designers and Engineers
* Advertising and Marketing Executives
* IT Consultants and Planners
* Sales and retail assistants
* Chartered Accountants
* Computer programmers and programmer developers
* As well as many others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top destinations for "Information Management" graduates |url=http://wlgd.thecareersgroup.co.uk/Destinations/Subject/Information+Management |website=University of London |accessdate=29 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029133917/http://wlgd.thecareersgroup.co.uk/Destinations/Subject/Information%2BManagement |archivedate=29 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates from these types of degrees have also found themselves working for some of the world's top organisations including Ernst and Young, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, and Bruder Mannesmann &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Management for Business BSc|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/undergraduate/degrees/ubsinfsbus05|website=UCL|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post Graduate Programs==
Keep in mind that although you can start a career straight after your bachelors, you may also be interested in furthering your study by enrolling in a masters program. Employers seem to be finding that business management undergraduates are too keen on starting work immediately, without actually having attained the essential skills need for a professional workplace. This may be in terms of general maturity and also the students ability to 'hit the ground running'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What makes a business graduate more employable?|url=http://theconversation.com/what-makes-a-business-graduate-more-employable-31800|website=The Conversation|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where masters students have the greater advantage.

There are many different masters programs available to graduates from an Information Management degree. However at this point, the studies tend to narrow down to more specific areas. As you have a solid background in both Business Management and IT, you have a large range to choose from.

If after studying you seem to be more keen in IT then perhaps you should consider doing a masters in either computer science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No. 2 Best Master's Degree For Jobs: Computer Science|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45ifij/no-2-best-masters-degree-for-jobs-computer-science/|website=Forbes|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or information systems.These two programs are some of the best for finding postgraduate jobs with high earning salaries.

==Student life==
Information Management students enrolled in a full-time degree generally have 8–13 hours a week in class, whether its lectures, tutorials, or seminars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BA in Information Management|url=http://www.cbs.dk/en/study/bachelor/ba-in-information-management/student-life|website=Copenhagen Business School|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However time must be spend outside of class working on coursework and assignments as well as doing prerequisite readings for certain modules.

One of the hardest parts about being a student is learning how to survive on a budget. To compensate for this, many students choose to get a part-time job while studying. In the United States, about 50% of students have a part-time job whilst enrolled in a full-time degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orszag|first1=Jonathan|title=LEARNING AND EARNING: WORKING IN COLLEGE|url=http://www.brockport.edu/career01/upromise|website=Brockport|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it becomes increasing difficult to balance a part-time job along with course work, classes, good grades, self study time, and social life. Often self study time suffers the most from part-time jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Richardson|first1=Mark|title=Academic plate spinning: The difficulties of balancing full time degree study with a part-time job |publisher=University of Worcester}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore it would be recommended to work no more than 10 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BA in Information Management|url=http://www.cbs.dk/en/study/bachelor/ba-in-information-management/student-life|website=Copenhagen Business School|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Back Scattering Alignment''' (BSA) is a coordinate system used in coherent electromagnetic scattering. The coordinate system is defined from the viewpoint of the wave source, before and after scattering. The BSA is most commonly used in [[radar]], specifically when working with a [[Sinclair Matrix]] because the [[monostatic radar]] detector and source are physically coaligned. BSA gives rise to  [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector, and eigenspace|conjugate eigenvalue equations]]. The alternative coordinate system in electromagnetic scattering is the [[Forward Scattering Alignment]] (FSA) which is primarily used in [[optics]]. Both coordinate systems contain essentially the same information and meaning, and thus a scattering matrix can be transformed from one to the other by use of the matrix,

&lt;math&gt; S_{FSA} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix} S_{BSA}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7044">In the [[social science|social sciences]], '''coding''' is an analytical process in which data, in both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] form (such as [[questionnaire]]s results) or [[qualitative research|qualitative]] form (such as [[interview]] [[:wikt:transcript|transcript]]s) are categorized to facilitate analysis.

One purpose of coding is to [[data transformation|transform the data]] into a form suitable for computer-aided analysis. This categorization of [[information]] is an important step, for example, in preparing [[data]] for [[computer]] processing with [[List of statistical packages|statistical software]].

Some studies will employ multiple coders working independently on the same data. This minimizes the chance of [[observational error|errors]] from coding and is believed to increase the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of data.

==Directive==
One code should apply to only one category and categories should be comprehensive. There should be clear guidelines for ''coders'' (individual who do the coding) so that code is consistent.

==Quantitative approach==
For quantitative analysis, data is coded usually into [[levels of measurement|measured and recorded as nominal or ordinal]] [[Variable (programming)|variables]].

Questionnaire data can be ''pre-coded'' (process of assigning codes to expected answers on designed questionnaire), ''field-coded'' (process of assigning codes as soon as data is available, usually during [[fieldwork]]), ''post-coded'' (coding of [[Open-ended question|open question]]s on completed questionnaires) or ''office-coded'' (done after fieldwork). Note that some of the above are not mutually exclusive.

In social sciences, [[spreadsheets]] such as [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] and more advanced software packages such as [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Matlab]], [[PSPP]]/[[SPSS]], [[DAP (software)|DAP]]/[[SAS System|SAS]], [[MiniTab]] and [[Stata]] are often used.

==Qualitative approach==
For disciplines in which a [[qualitative research|qualitative]] format is preferential, including [[ethnography]], [[humanistic geography]] or [[phenomenological psychology]] a varied approach to coding can be applied. Iain Hay (2005) outlines a two-step process beginning with basic coding in order to distinguish overall themes, followed by a more in depth, interpretive code in which more specific trends and patterns can be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Hay, I. (2005). ''Qualitative research methods in human geography'' (2nd ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of qualitative coding can be attributed to either grounded or ''a priori'' coding.&lt;ref&gt;Saldaña, Johnny. (2015). "The Coding Manual for Qualitative Researchers" (3rd ed.). SAGE Publications Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Grounded coding refers to allowing notable themes and patterns emerge from the document themselves, where as ''a priori'' coding requires the researcher to apply pre-existing theoretical frameworks to analyze the documents. As coding methods are applied across various texts, the researcher is able to apply axial coding, which is the process of selecting core thematic categories present in several documents to discover common patterns and relations.&lt;ref&gt;Grbich, Carol. (2013). "Qualitative Data Analysis" (2nd ed.). The Flinders University of South Australia: SAGE Publications Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to constructing categories, a researcher must apply a first cycle coding method. There are a multitude of methods available, and a researcher will want to pick one that is suited for the format and nature of their documents. Not all methods can be applied to every type of document. Some examples of first cycle coding methods include:

*''In Vivo Coding'': codes terms and phrases used by the participants themselves. The objective is to attempt to give the participants a voice in the research.
*''Process Coding'': this method uses gerunds ("-ing" words) only to describe and display actions throughout the document. It is useful for examining processes, emotional phases and rituals.
*''Versus Coding'': uses binary terms to describe groups and processes. The goal is to see which processes and organizations are in conflict with each other throughout the document. These can be both conceptual and grounded objects. 
*''Values Coding'': codes that attempt to exhibit the inferred values, attitudes and beliefs of participants. In doing so, the research may discern patterns in world views.

The process can be done manually, which can be as simple as highlighting different concepts with different colours, or fed into a software package. Some examples of [[computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software|qualitative software packages]] include [[Atlas.ti]], [[MAXQDA]], [[NVivo]], and [[QDA Miner]].

After assembling codes it is time to organize them into broader themes and categories. The process generally involves identifying themes from the existing codes, reducing the themes to a manageable number, creating hierarchies within the themes and then linking themes together through theoretical modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Gery and H. Bernard. (2003). "Techniques to Identify Themes." Field Methods. Vol.15(1). pp85-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memos==
Creating memos during the coding process is integral to both grounded and a priori coding approaches. Qualitative research is inherently reflexive; as the researcher delves deeper into their subject, it is important to chronicle their own thought processes through reflective or methodological memos, as doing so may highlight their own subjective interpretations of data &lt;ref&gt;Primeau, Loree A. (2003). "Reflections on Self in Qualitative Research: Stories of Family" The American Journal of Occupational Therapy. Vol. 57, 9-16&lt;/ref&gt; It is crucial to begin memoing at the onset of research. Regardless of the type of memo produced, what is important is that the process initiates critical thinking and productivity in the research. Doing so will facilitate easier and more coherent analyses as the project draws on &lt;ref&gt;Charmaz, Kathy. (2006). "Constructing Grounded Theory: A Practical Guide through Qualitative Analysis." SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;
Memos can be used to map research activities, uncover meaning from data, maintaining research momentum and engagement and opening communication.&lt;ref&gt;Birks et al. (2008). "Memoing in qualitative research" Journal of Research in Nursing. SAGE Publications. Vol. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constant Bar''' (14 October 1817, [[Nantes]] – June 1884, [[Paramaribo]]) was a French [[entomologist]].

Constant Bar lived in [[French Guiana]] at L'île Portal in the commune of [[Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni]] and with his three brothers made extensive entomological explorations of that region, collecting specimens for his own studies and for [[Charles Oberthür]] and others. He wrote Note critique sur les différent systèmes de classification des lépidoptères rhopalocères établis depuis l'époque de Latreille et essai d'une nouvelle classification jusqu'aux genres exclusivement. ''Annales de la Societé entomologique de France'', Paris, (5) 8 (1): 5–30. (1878). In 1854 he became a Member of the [[Société entomologique de France]].

He is honoured in the names ''[[Hypercompe bari]]'', ''[[Heliconia bari]]'' and ''[[Parides lysander|Parides lysander bari]]''.

The NOAA '''Cooperative Observer Program''' ('''COOP''') is a [[Citizen science|citizen]] [[weather observer]] network run by the U.S. [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) and [[National Centers for Environmental Information]] (NCEI). Over 8,700 volunteers from the fifty states and all [[Territories of the United States|territories]] report at least daily a variety of [[weather]] conditions such as daily maximum and minimum [[temperature]]s, 24-hour [[precipitation]] totals, including [[snow]]fall, and significant weather occurrences throughout a day that are recorded via remarks in observer logs. Some stations also report [[Stream gauge|stream stage]] or [[Tide gauge|tidal level]]s.

Daily observations are reported electronically or over the phone, and monthly logs are submitted electronically or via the mail. Many stations are located in rural areas but the network also includes long-term stations in most urban centers. Observation locations include farms, in urban and suburban areas, National Parks, seashores, and mountaintops. Volunteers are trained by [[List of National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices|local NWS offices]] who provide [[rain gauge]]s, snowsticks, [[thermometer]]s, or other instruments. Data is initially received and analyzed by local NWS offices then ultimately stored and analyzed by NCEI, which also does final [[data quality]] checks.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.weather.gov/coop/Overview |title = What is the Coop Program? |date = |website = Cooperative Observer Program  | publisher = National Weather Service |access-date = 2018-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program began with act of Congress in 1890&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://ccsinventory.wilsoncenter.org/#projectId/79 |title = National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Program |date = |website = Federal Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Catalog |publisher = CitizenScience.gov |access-date = 2018-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew out a network of observers developed by the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite book |author = National Weather Service Modernization Committee, Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems, National Research Council |title = Future of the National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Network |series = Toward a New National Weather Service |publisher = National Academies Press |date = 1998 |location = Washington, D.C. |url= https://www.nap.edu/read/6197/ |isbn = 978-0-309-06146-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a backbone of the U.S. climatological observation network and remains an important network in providing long-term observations of particular locations.

The Cooperative Weather Observer network consists of manual observations of only a few variables and consists of daily summaries rather than being continuous (i.e. real-time). Because of these limitations and other sensor limitations&lt;ref name="Leeper"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Leeper |first = Ronald D. |author2 = J. Rennie |author3 = M. A.

It also funds international projects on a bilateral basis in cooperation with several partner agencies as well as projects carried out within international research programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.czech.cz/en/66993-the-grant-agency-of-the-czech-republic-czech-science-foundation | title = The Grant Agency of the Czech Republic – Czech Science Foundation | publisher = Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs | date = 2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of two major government-supported research funding agencies in the Czech Republic, the other being the Technological Agency of the Czech Republic (TAČR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://czechstartups.org/news/410 | title = Czech Government approved the increase of funding budget for R&amp;D of 3.7 billion CZK | date = 2016-05-31 | publisher = CZ StartUP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GACR goals ==
* To provide financial support for projects in basic research with a high potential for achieving world class results.
* To promote and enhance international scientific cooperation in basic research.
* To help create attractive conditions for the [[professional development]] of young and early-stage researchers.
* To ensure that entrusted funds are used as effectively as possible to the benefit of the Czech and international scientific community.
* To create, within existing laws, the best possible conditions for the administration of project proposals and awarded projects.

== GACR structure ==
The GACR authorities are the President, Presidium, Scientific Advisory Board and Supervisory Board. The Presidium is assisted by Discipline Committees. Evaluation Panels are the expert bodies of Discipline Committee. Organizational and administrative work is in the competency of the GACR Office.

=== GACR Presidium ===
The Presidium of the Czech Science Foundation is appointed by the [[Government of the Czech Republic]]. The Presidium is authorized to organize the Calls for Proposals for scientific and research projects and to award grants. It consists of five members. The GACR Presidium is headed by the President. He/she represents GACR and acts in its name in all relevant matters. Members of the Presidium are elected for four years with a maximum of two consecutive terms. Each member is responsible for one of the scientific areas (Physical Sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities, Technical Sciences, Medical and Biological Sciences, Agricultural and Biological-Environmental Sciences).

=== GACR Scientific Advisory Board ===
The Scientific Advisory Board consists of 12 experts representing different scientific fields. Membership in the Scientific Advisory Board lasts for four years with a maximum of two consecutive terms. The Scientific Advisory Board provides expert scientific advice to the GACR Presidium with regards to promoted projects and the structure and operation of GACR Discipline Committees and Panels. It also evaluates overall scientific level of the Czech Science Foundation and creates the strategy for its future development and direction.

=== GACR Supervisory Board ===
The Supervisory Board has 10 members, who are appointed by the [[Parliament of the Czech Republic]]. Membership in the Supervisory Board lasts for four years a maximum of two consecutive terms. The Supervisory Board controls the transparency of the evaluation process, oversees the distribution of funds and overall functioning of the Czech Science Foundation.

=== GACR Discipline Committees and Panels ===
Discipline Committees are permanent advisory bodies, which assist the Presidium during the evaluation process. Panels are the expert bodies of Discipline Committees.  Each of the committees consists of Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen from individual Panels and has between 10 and 20 members who are nominated by the GACR Presidium. The total numer of Panels is 39. Members are appointed for a two-year term with a possibility of two consecutive terms maximum.

=== GACR Office ===
The GACR Office is the organisational and administrative body of the Czech Science Foundation. It is managed by the Director, who is appointed and recalled by the GACR President. The GACR Office carries out the organisation of evaluation process of submitted project proposals and the agenda for ongoing and completed projects.  International activities and administration of international projects are also handled by the Office. The office  transfers funds to the recipients of the grants, offers consultations to recipients and grant project researchers in financial matters, administers the budget of the GACR Office, provides for all related agenda as well as monitors compliance with procedures and rules prescribed by the generally valid economic and legal regulations or by the GACR Guidelines.

== Types of projects ==
GACR provides financial support for the following types of projects:
* Standard projects: projects by outstanding scholars and research teams;
* Junior projects: projects for excellent young researchers and early-stage researchers with international experience;
* International projects: projects by international research teams based on agreements between GACR and foreign science foundations (bilateral agreements, Lead Agency Principle agreements, etc.); GACR has successfully established bilateral cooperation with three partner organizations:
** [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] (DFG),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/dfg_im_profil/im_internationalen_kontext/partner/mou_ga_cr_dfg_05.pdf | title = Memorandum of Understanding of Scientific Cooperation between the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the Czech Science Foundation | publisher = DFG | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan)]] (MOST),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.most.gov.tw/czech/en/list?menu_id=e434ab10-f522-4d9d-85d2-0fe84e056ddf| title = About Sci-Tech Division | publisher =  Science and Technology Division Taipei. Economic and Cultural Office in Czech Republic | date = 2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[National Research Foundation of Korea]] (NRF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/south_korea/documents/event/sntday_20150325/presentations/2.1_overall_presentation.pdf | author = Gareth Davies | title = Science, Technology and Innovation in Europe | date = 2015-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* GACR proposes joint projects based on Lead Agency Principle with [[Austrian Science Fund|Fonds zur Förderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung]] (FWF), Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fwf.ac.at/de/ueber-den-fwf/internationale-aktivitaeten/bilaterale-aktivitaeten/ | title = Bilaterale Aktivitäten | publisher = FWF | accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Post-doctoral]] projects: projects by young and early-stage researchers (no new calls considered since 2014);
* Projects promoting excellence in basic research: multidisciplinary projects of several research institutions aimed at outstanding basic research that cannot be funded within GACR standard projects (no new calls).

The topic of all types of project is determined by the applicant (bottom-up principle). The duration of projects is 2–3 years and proposals are invited in all disciplines of basic research.

== International activities ==
Development and strengthening of international relations is one of the GACR’s long-term priorities. Worldwide international cooperation is implemented within the GACR’s membership in the [[Global Research Council]] (GRC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nsf.gov/news/newsmedia/globalsummit/biographical_snapshots.pdf | title = Global Summit on Merit Review. Biographical Data | publisher = Global Research Council | year = 2012 | place = Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the pan-European level especially within the GACR’s membership in the [[European Science Foundation]] (ESF) (until reorganization of the latter) and in [[Science Europe]] (SE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scienceeurope.org/about-us/member-organisations | title = Member Organisations | publisher = Science Europe | accessdate = 2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on bilateral agreements GACR closely cooperates with Germany, Austria, Taiwan and South Korea.

'''Language, Proof and Logic''' is an educational software package, devised and written by [[Jon Barwise]] and [[John Etchemendy]], geared to teaching [[formal logic]] through the use of a tight integration between a textbook (same name as the package) and four software programs, where three of them are logic related (Boole, Fitch and Tarski's World) and the other (Submit) is an internet-based grading service. The name is a [[pun]] derived from ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'', the philosophy book by [[A. J. Ayer]].
On September 2, 2014, there was launched a [[massive open online course]] (MOOC) with the same name, which utilizes this educational software package.

A short description of the programs:

* Boole (named after [[George Boole]]) - a program that facilitates the construction and checking of truth tables and related notions ([[tautology (logic)|tautology]], tautological consequence, etc.);
* Fitch (named after [[Frederic Brenton Fitch]]) - a natural deduction proof environment in [[Fitch-style calculus]] for giving and checking first-order proofs;
* [[Tarski's World]] (named after [[Alfred Tarski]]) - a program that teaches the basic first-order language and its semantics using a model theoretic-like approach, where the "world" consists of a little grid and some simple objects;
* Submit - a program that allows students to submit exercises done with the above programs to the Grade Grinder, the online grading service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grim | first1 = P. | title = Language, Proof and Logic | journal = The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 377–379 | doi = 10.2307/2687756 | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = | jstor = 2687756 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

LIHC is the [[umbrella organization]] for four integrated programs: the Leadership Development Initiative (LDI), the Presidents' Forum (TPF), the ''Harvard Undergraduate Leadership Magazine'' (''HULM''), and the LIHC-Citizen Schools Youth Outreach Initiative.

== History and Structure ==

Founded in 2005 by four Harvard undergraduates, LIHC was established in response to the lack of leadership development resources available to Harvard College students. More recently, in September 2008, LIHC announced its definition of leadership: "the skill of motivating, guiding and empowering a team towards a socially responsible vision." The Leadership Institute is guided by an Executive Board of eight undergraduates and a Board of Advisors drawn from [[Harvard Business School]], [[Harvard Law School]], [[Harvard Medical School]], the [[Kennedy School of Government]], and as well as government and corporate institutions.

Members of the 2011 Executive Board are:

'''The current Board of Advisors as of (May 2015):'''

Jared Katseff
 
Jared Katseff is currently a candidate for an MBA at Harvard Business School as well as a Master in Urban Planning at Harvard Graduate School of Design. He is pursuing both degrees because he is interested in realizing transit oriented development by making the financial case for walkable urbanism. Originally from Manalapan, New Jersey, he graduated Magna Cum Laude from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania with a major in Finance and Real Estate. After college, Jared worked for three years at McKinsey &amp; Company, where he focused his time charting economic development strategies for cities in North America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
 
 
Rita Chung
 
Originally from Hong Kong, but growing up between Vancouver, Hong Kong, Duino (Italy) and London, I am now pursuing her Master in Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School (HKS). My interest is in energy and water policy. Prior to HKS, I worked for Earthwatch Institute in their Hong Kong office, developing and managing employee engagement projects on climate change and freshwater scarcity research across the Asia Pacific region for large corporations. My work at Earthwatch led to my interest in energy and water resource distribution conflicts, and I am passionate about finding more equitable and sustainable ways of distributing energy and water resources around the world. In my other lives, I have worked in investment banking in London, campaigned for human rights issues in Canada and Israel, and launched a magazine in Shanghai.


Tuba Rashid Khan
 
Tuba is currently in the child advocacy track at Harvard. She is a strong advocate for increasing opportunities, access and early identification for special needs children. A doctor with also a public health degree from Harvard, she has worked on numerous projects on child development in Pakistan, UAE, Kenya, US and Nigeria in association with MIT and Boston Children’s Hospital. Having completed the leadership concentration from HSPH, her other leadership experiences include being a teaching fellow, instructor and leading special needs projects in Bangladesh. She also happens to be a scrabble fanatic and loves to jet ski.


Tessa Hamilton
 
I am a recent graduate of the University of Arizona, where I completed my degree in Psychology. As an undergraduate I was actively engaged in research projects as well as community projects related to youth empowerment, mental health, and educational equity. I am currently studying Prevention Science/School Social Work at the Ed school and I am especially interested in promoting leadership and participatory improvement efforts amongst low-income Latino populations. Outside of school, I am passionate about nutrition and fitness. I am an avid socializer. Currently, I serve as a Senator on the Student Council Association at the Ed school and as a member of the Association’s Diversity Committee.


Yasser Jeelani
 
I am a physician from London, England, training in Neurological Surgery and currently here at Harvard doing a postdoctoral research fellowship in Minimally Invasive Pediatric neurosurgery at HMS. Being orphaned at a young age of 8, and being left to tend to myself and to my siblings, challenges demanded not only solving challenges for myself, but also to lead my siblings to survival. Since then, I have been capitulating on those instincts by utilizing them in all walks of life, academics included. At my current position, I have been instrumental in establishing the first Neurosurgery cadaver laboratory for minimally invasive and skull base neurosurgery at Harvard, where we will be training neurosurgeons and fellows besides conducting some ground breaking research in attempting novel approaches to relatively inaccessible areas of the brain.


Benjamin Summers
 
I’m an active duty Army officer, current MBA candidate at Harvard Business School and will return to West Point in 2015 for a 2-year teaching fellowship in the Department of Social Sciences. I live with my wife, Chrissy, in Cambridge (and we’re expecting a new member to our family in September). After graduating from West Point in 2006, I attended the Army’s flight school and was qualified in the Blackhawk helicopter. After flight school, I deployed twice with the 101st Airborne Division. Whether leading a company of Soldiers during a deployment to Afghanistan or leading an aircrew during a Blackhawk helicopter combat mission, I’ve found that successful leadership often means trusting, empowering and developing the people around me. That realization is what brought me to HBS and what makes the idea of teaching and mentoring cadets at West Point so fulfilling. Serving on the Board of Advisors with the LIHC would match with these passions towards leadership development.I currently serve as a VP for Admission for the Armed Forces Alumni Association at HBS, as a planning officer for the Harvard Veterans Alumni Organization and as a member of the Social Enterprise Club.

Amal Elbakhar
 
I grew up in an immigrant culture in which educational achievement was difficult to obtain, and this has always served as a source of motivation for me. Thus, as an eager New Yorker, I spent my college years immersing myself in every aspect of my community, attending events as well as leading them. Experience after experience, I realized that – academically – women’s issues are the most important to me. I am intrigued by the concept of using the law and policy to affect social change in a way that serves a greater societal purpose. In fact, I am driven by any topic that is innovative, fun and challenging – and yet, moves an important societal discourse forward.
 
 
Desmond Lim
 
Desmond Lim previously worked for Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS in a wide variety of sectors including financial institutions, energy and power, and retail. He ran an education non-profit, Choson Exchange, teaching business skills to over 200 North Koreans in Pyongyang, Beijing, and Singapore. He also previously co-founded a Thai-cuisine restaurant, started up a clothes trading company, and was an infantry officer with the Singapore Armed Forces for 2.5 years.

A '''learning curve''' is a graphical representation of how an increase in [[learning]] (measured on the vertical axis) comes from greater [[experience]] (the horizontal axis); or how the more someone (or thing) does something, the better they get at it.&lt;ref name="businessdictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Curve|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/learning-curve.html|website=Business Dictionary|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alanf777 Lcd fig01.png|thumb|right|Fig 1: Learning curve for a single subject, showing how learning improves with experience]]
[[Image:Alanf777 Lcd fig02.png|thumb|right|Fig 2: A learning curve averaged over many trials is smooth, and can be expressed as a mathematical function]]
The term ''learning curve'' is used in two main ways: where the same task is repeated in a series of trials, or where a body of knowledge is learned over time. The first person to describe the learning curve  was [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] in 1885, in the field of the psychology of learning, although the name wasn't used until 1903.&lt;ref name="ebbing_book"&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=oRSMDF6y3l8C&amp;printsec=frontcover Page 42, Fig 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=ikEMAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22learning+curve%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22learning%20curve%22&amp;f=false The American Journal of Psychology, Volume 14 1903 By Granville Stanley Hall, Edward Bradford Titchene&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, [[Theodore Paul Wright]] described the effect of learning on [[production costs]] in the [[aircraft industry]].&lt;ref name="Wright, T.P. 1936"&gt;Wright, T.P., "Factors Affecting the Cost of Airplanes", ''Journal of Aeronautical Sciences'', 3(4) (1936): 122–128.&lt;/ref&gt; This form, in which ''unit cost'' is plotted against ''total production'', is sometimes called an [[experience curve]].

The familiar expression "''a steep learning curve''" is intended to mean that the activity is difficult to learn, although a learning curve with a steep start actually represents rapid progress.&lt;ref name="surg"&gt;"Laparoscopic Colon Resection Early in the Learning Curve", ''Ann. Surg.'' 2006 June; 243(6): 730–737, see the [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1570580 "Discussions"] section, Dr. Smith's remark about the usage of the term "steep learning curve": "First, semantics. A steep learning curve is one where you gain proficiency over a short number of trials. That means the curve is steep. I think semantically we are really talking about a prolonged or long learning curve. I know it is a subtle distinction, but I can't miss the opportunity to make that point."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zimmer" /&gt;

==In psychology==
The first person to describe the learning curve  was [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] in 1885. His tests involved memorizing series of [[nonsense syllable]]s, and recording the success over a number of trials. The translation does not use the term ''learning curve''—but he presents diagrams of learning against trial number. He also notes that the score can decrease, or even oscillate.&lt;ref name="zimmer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Ebbinghaus/wozniak.htm ''Classics in the history of psychology'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=oRSMDF6y3l8C&amp;printsec=frontcover page 42, Fig 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known use of the term ''learning curve'' is from 1903: "Bryan and Harter (6) found in their study of the acquisition of the telegraphic language a learning curve which had the rapid rise at the beginning followed by a period of retardation, and was thus convex to the vertical axis."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zimmer" /&gt;

Psychologist Arthur Bills gave a more detailed description of learning curves in 1934. He also discussed the properties of different types of learning curves, such as negative acceleration, positive acceleration, plateaus, and [[ogive]] curves. (Fig 1)&lt;ref&gt;Bills, A.G. (1934). General experimental psychology. Longmans Psychology Series. (pp. 192-215). New York, NY: Longmans, Green and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In economics==
In 1936, [[Theodore Paul Wright]] described the effect of learning on [[production costs]] in the [[aircraft industry]] and proposed a mathematical model of the [[Experience curve effects|learning curve]].&lt;ref name="Wright, T.P. 1936"/&gt;

In 1968 [[Bruce Henderson]] of the [[Boston Consulting Group]] (BCG) generalized the Unit Cost model pioneered by Wright, and specifically used a [[Power Law]], which is sometimes called ''Henderson's Law''. He named this particular version the '''experience curve'''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/Classics/strategy_the_experience_curve/ BCJ 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant2003"&gt;{{Citation |last=Grant |first=Robert M. |authorlink= |title=Contemporary strategy analysis  |year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell publishing |location=[[United States|U.S.]], [[UK]], [[Australia]], [[Germany]] |isbn=1-4051-1999-3 }} &lt;!-- note first published in 1991 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Research by BCG in the 1970s observed experience curve effects for various industries that ranged from 10 to 25 percent.&lt;ref name="HaxMajluf"&gt;{{Citation

The economic learning of productivity and efficiency generally follows the same kinds of [[Experience curve effects|experience curves]] and have interesting secondary effects. Efficiency and productivity improvement can be considered as whole organization or industry or economy learning processes, as well as for individuals. The general pattern is of first speeding up and then slowing down, as the practically achievable level of methodology improvement is reached. The effect of reducing local effort and resource use by learning improved methods paradoxically often has the opposite latent effect on the next larger scale system, by facilitating its expansion, or [[economic growth]], as discussed in the [[Jevons paradox]] in the 1880s and updated in the [[Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate]] in the 1980s.

== Examples  and mathematical modeling ==
A learning curve is a plot of proxy measures for implied [[learning]] ([[Uncertainty coefficient|proficiency]] or progression toward a limit) with [[experience]].

*The ''Horizontal Axis'' represents ''experience'' either directly as time (clock time, or the time spent on the activity), or can be related to time (a number of trials, or the total number of units produced).
*The ''Vertical Axis'' is a measure representing ''learning'' or ''proficiency'' or other proxy for "efficiency" or "productivity". It can either be increasing (for example, the score in a test), or decreasing (the time to complete a test). (Fig 5)

For the performance of one person in a series of trials the curve can be erratic, with proficiency increasing, decreasing or leveling out in a [[Plateau (mathematics)|plateau]]. (Fig 1)

When the results of a large number of individual trials are [[average]]d then a smooth curve results, which can often be described with a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]]. (Fig 2)

Amsterdam: Pergamon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bgu.ac.il/~akarniel/pub/LeibowitzetalJMP2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Sigmoid function|S-Curve or Sigmoid function]] is the idealized general form of all learning curves, with slowly accumulating small steps at first followed by larger steps and then successively smaller ones later, as the learning activity reaches its limit.  That idealizes the normal progression from discovery of something to learn about followed to the limit of what learning about it.  The other shapes of learning curves (4, 5 &amp; 6) show segments of S-curves without their full extents. 
:In this case the improvement of proficiency starts slowly, then increases rapidly, and finally levels off. (Fig 3)

* Exponential growth
:The proficiency can increase without limit, as in [[Exponential growth]] (Fig 4)

* Exponential rise or fall to a Limit
:Proficiency can exponentially approach a limit in a manner similar to that in which a capacitor charges or discharges ([[Exponential decay]]) through a resistor. (Fig 5)

:The increase in skill or retention of information may increase rapidly to its maximum rate during the initial attempts, and then gradually levels out, meaning that the subject's skill does not improve much with each later repetition, with less new knowledge gained over time.

* [[Power law]]

:This is similar in appearance to an [[Exponential decay]] function, and is almost always used for a decreasing performance metric, such as cost. (Fig 6) It also has the property that if you plot the [[logarithm]] of proficiency against the [[logarithm]] of experience the result is a straight line, and it is often presented that way.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Experience curve.gif|center|500px|thumb|Fig 8. Experience curve shown in linear-linear and log-log forms]] --&gt;

:The specific case of a plot of Unit Cost versus Total Production with a Power Law was named the '''Experience Curve''': the mathematical function is sometimes called ''Henderson's Law''.

:This form of learning curve is used extensively in industry for cost projections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classweb.gmu.edu/aloerch/LearningCurve%20Basics.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718044848/http://classweb.gmu.edu/aloerch/LearningCurve%20Basics.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-18 |df= }} Department of Defense Manual Number 5000.2-M, mandates the use of learning curves for costing of defense programs (variable costs of production)&lt;/ref&gt;

The page on "[[Experience curve effects]]" offers more discussion of the mathematical theory of representing them as deterministic processes, and provides a good group of empirical [[Experience curve effects#Reasons for the effect|examples]] of how that technique has been applied.

==In machine learning==
Plots relating performance to experience are widely used in [[machine learning]]. Performance is the error rate or accuracy of the [[learning]] system, while experience may be the number of training examples used for learning or the number of iterations used in [[optimizing]] the system model parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sammut|first1=Claude|title=Encyclopedia of Machine Learning|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-30768-8|page=578|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i8hQhp1a62UC&amp;pg=PT604&amp;dq=neural+network+learning+curve&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=83VQUcy9GKT90gHTzoHoBQ&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAw|edition=1st|last2=Webb |first2 = Geoffrey I.

==Broader interpretations==
Initially introduced in [[educational psychology|educational]] and [[behavioral psychology]], the term has acquired a broader interpretation over time, and expressions such as "experience curve", "improvement curve", "cost improvement curve", "progress curve", "progress function", "startup curve", and "efficiency curve" are often used interchangeably. In economics the subject is rates of "[[economic development|development]]", as development refers to a whole system learning process with varying rates of progression. Generally speaking all learning displays '''incremental change''' over time, but describes an '''[[Sigmoid function|"S" curve]]''' which has different appearances depending on the time scale of observation. It has now also become associated with the evolutionary theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] and other kinds of '''revolutionary change''' in complex systems generally, relating to [[innovation]], [[organizational behavior]] and the [[management]] of group learning, among other fields.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/258605 Connie JG Gersick  1991 "Revolutionary Change Theories: A Multilevel Exploration of the Punctuated Equilibrium Paradigm" The Academy of Management Review, Vol. 16, No. 1  pp. 10-36] 1&lt;/ref&gt; These processes of rapidly emerging new form appear to take place by complex learning within the systems themselves, which when observable, display curves of changing rates that accelerate and decelerate.

==General learning limits==
''Learning curves'', also called ''experience curves'', relate to the much broader subject of natural limits for resources and technologies in general. Such limits generally present themselves as increasing complications that slow the learning of how to do things more efficiently, like the well-known limits of perfecting any process or product or to perfecting measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |bibcode= 1988ptw..conf..291P |title=Towards the Limits of Precision and Accuracy in Measurement}}&lt;/ref&gt; These practical experiences match the predictions of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] for the limits of waste reduction generally. Approaching limits of perfecting things to eliminate waste meets geometrically increasing effort to make progress, and provides an environmental measure of all factors seen and unseen changing the learning experience. Perfecting things becomes ever more difficult despite increasing effort despite continuing positive, if ever diminishing, results. The same kind of slowing progress due to complications in learning also appears in the limits of useful technologies and of profitable markets applying to [[product life cycle management]] and [http://www.actapress.com/PaperInfo.aspx?PaperID=19159&amp;reason=500 software development cycles]). Remaining market segments or remaining potential efficiencies or efficiencies are found in successively less convenient forms.

Efficiency and development curves typically follow a two-phase process of first bigger steps corresponding to finding things easier, followed by smaller steps of finding things more difficult. It reflects bursts of learning following breakthroughs that make learning easier followed by meeting constraints that make learning ever harder, perhaps toward a point of cessation.

* '''Natural Limits''' One of the key studies in the area concerns diminishing returns on investments generally, either physical or financial, pointing to whole system limits for resource development or other efforts. The most studied of these may be [[Energy Return on Energy Invested]] or EROEI, discussed at length in an [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Energy_return_on_investment_(EROI) Encyclopedia of the Earth article] and in an [http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3412 OilDrum article] and [http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3786 series] also referred to as [http://www.dani2989.com/matiere1/hubbertpeakoilgb.htm Hubert curves]. The energy needed to produce energy is a measure of our difficulty in learning how to make remaining energy resources useful in relation to the effort expended. Energy returns on energy invested have been in continual decline for some time, caused by natural resource limits and increasing investment. Energy is both nature's and our own principal resource for making things happen. The point of diminishing returns is when increasing investment makes the resource more expensive. As natural limits are approached, easily used sources are exhausted and ones with more complications need to be used instead. As an environmental signal persistently diminishing EROI indicates an approach of whole system limits in our ability to make things happen.
* '''Useful Natural Limits''' EROEI measures the return on invested effort as a ratio of R/I or ''learning progress''. The inverse I/R measures ''learning difficulty''. The simple difference is that if R approaches zero R/I will too, but I/R will approach infinity. When complications emerge to limit learning progress the limit of ''useful returns'', uR, is approached and R-uR approaches zero. The ''difficulty of useful learning'' I/(R-uR) approaches infinity as increasingly difficult tasks make the effort unproductive. That point is approached as a vertical asymptote, at a particular point in time, that can be delayed only by unsustainable effort. It defines a point at which enough investment has been made and the ''task is done'', usually planned to be the same as when the ''task is complete''. For unplanned tasks it may be either foreseen or discovered by surprise. The usefulness measure, uR, is affected by the complexity of environmental responses that can only be measured when they occur unless they are foreseen.

== In culture ==

==="Steep learning curve"===
The expression '''''steep learning curve''''' is  used with opposite meanings. Most sources, including the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', and ''[[Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary]]'', define a learning curve as the rate at which skill is acquired, so a steep increase would mean a quick increment of skill.&lt;ref name="surg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="grammarphobia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Steep learning curves|url=http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2009/07/steep-learning-curves.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the term is often used in common English with the meaning of a difficult initial learning process.&lt;ref name="zimmer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="grammarphobia"/&gt;

Arguably, the common English use is due to metaphorical interpretation of the curve as a hill to climb. (A steeper hill is initially hard, while a gentle slope is less strainful, though sometimes rather tedious. Accordingly, the shape of the curve (hill) may not indicate the total amount of [[work (physics)|work]] required. Instead, it can be understood as a matter of preference related to ambition, personality and learning style.)

&lt;gallery class=center widths=270 heights=180 style="line-height:130%"&gt;
File:Alanf777 Lcd fig08.png|Fig 9 : Short and long learning curves
File:Alanf777 Lcd fig09.png|Fig 10 : Product A has lower functionality and a short learning curve. Product B has greater functionality but takes longer to learn
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The term ''learning curve'' with meanings of ''easy'' and ''difficult'' can be described with adjectives like ''short'' and ''long'' rather than ''steep'' and ''shallow''.&lt;ref name="surg" /&gt;  If two products have similar functionality then the one with a "steep" curve is probably better, because it can be learned in a shorter time. (Fig 9) On the other hand, if two products have different functionality, then one with a ''short'' curve (a short time to learn) and limited functionality may not be as good as one with a ''long'' curve (a long time to learn) and greater functionality. (Fig 10)

For example, the Windows program [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]] is extremely simple to learn, but offers little after this. At the other extreme is the UNIX terminal editor [[Vim (text editor)|vi or Vim]], which is difficult to learn, but offers a wide array of features after the user has learned how to use it.&lt;ref&gt;http://unix.rulez.org/~calver/pictures/curves.jpg  Apparently from http://blogs.msdn.com/b/steverowe/archive/2004/11/17/code-editor-learning-curves.aspx Code Editor Learning Curves SteveRowe 17 Nov 2004 7:59 PM&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "ON a steep learning curve" ===
[[Ben Zimmer]] discusses the use of the term "ON a steep learning curve" in an article "A Steep Learning Curve" for ''[[Downton Abbey]]'', concentrating mainly on whether it is an [[anachronism]]. "Matthew Crawley, the presumptive heir of Downton Abbey and now the co-owner of the estate, says, 'I've been on a steep learning curve since arriving at Downton.' By this he means that he's had a difficult time learning the ways of Downton. Unfortunately, people didn't start talking that way until the 1970s."&lt;ref name="zimmer"&gt;http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/a-steep-learning-curve-for-downton-abbey/ Ben Zimmer, February 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3767 "Downton Abbey" anachronisms: beyond nitpickery, Ben Zimmer, February 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3767 Comment by J Oliver : Season Three, episode 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimmer also comments that the popular use of ''steep'' as ''difficult'' is a reversal of the technical meaning. He identifies the first use of ''steep learning curve'' as 1973, and the ''arduous'' interpretation as 1978.

'''''Lincoln and Darwin: Shared Visions of Race, Science, and Religion''''' is a 2010 book by James Lander about the lives and views of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Charles Darwin]].

==Overview==
Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin were born on the same day, February 12, 1809. Both lost their mother at a young age and, despite their differences in upbringing, both men saw themselves as [[autodidact]]s.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; Lander argues that they also shared an interest in science and a [[skeptical]] approach to religion.&lt;ref name=allen/&gt; Darwin closely followed the events of the [[American Civil War]] and wanted Lincoln and the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] to prevail, but it is unlikely that Lincoln read Darwin's work.&lt;ref name=conn/&gt;

''Lincoln and Darwin'' is structured as a series of alternating narratives concerning each man's interactions with the events and discoveries of the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name=allen/&gt; Lander explores similarities in the intellectual development, concerns, and impacts of Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin, focusing in particular on the issue of [[slavery in the United States]], which both men influentially opposed.&lt;ref name=largent/&gt; Lander's broader argument is that Lincoln and Darwin shared the same outlook on the central issues of race, science, and religion. He also looks at the relationship between science and race in the 19th century United States and the emergence and influence of [[scientific racism]].&lt;ref name=conn/&gt; Lander situates Lincoln and Darwin against their respective opponents: [[Stephen A. Douglas]], Lincoln's rival in Illinois politics, and [[Louis Agassiz]], an advocate of [[polygenism]].&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Tom Allen, in ''The Journal of the Civil War Era'', wrote that ''Lincoln and Darwin'' "is not always completely convincing" with regard to the "shared vision" Lander identifies, but concluded that the book "is well worth reading. The prose is delightfully lucid, and the parallel account of two lives so apparently different provides a fresh perspective on the intellectual culture of the nineteenth century."&lt;ref name=allen&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_civil_war_era/v001/1.3.allen.html|title=[Review of ''Lincoln and Darwin: Shared Visions of Race, Science, and Religion'' by James Lander]|work=The Journal of the Civil War Era|first=Tom|last=Allen|volume=1|issue=3|year=2011|accessdate=July 3, 2015|pages=425–427|subscription=yes|doi=10.1353/cwe.2011.0054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean H. Baker, writing in ''Civil War History'', described ''Lincoln and Darwin'' as "a profound comparison of the two men's perspectives and ... a worthy addition to the numerous individual studies of either man", and praised Lander for providing a new means of understanding and appreciating each man.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/civil_war_history/v057/57.4.baker.html|title=[Review of ''Lincoln and Darwin: Shared Visions of Race, Science, and Religion'' by James Lander]|work=Civil War History|first=Jean H.|last=Baker|volume=57|issue=4|year=2011|accessdate=July 2, 2015|pages=405–408|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Conn, in the ''[[Reports of the National Center for Science Education]]'', noted that Lander's comparisons occasionally appear "a little strained", but that "more often than not these comparisons and juxtapositions persuade"; and praised in particular Lander's analysis of the interactions between race and science.&lt;ref name=conn&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://reports.ncse.com/index.php/rncse/article/view/26/17|title=[Review of ''Lincoln and Darwin: Shared Visions of Race, Science, and Religion'' by James Lander]|work=[[Reports of the National Center for Science Education]]|first=Steven|last=Conn|volume=31|issue=2|year=2011|accessdate=July 2, 2015|pages=5.1–5.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen L. Hansen, in the ''[[Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society]]'', criticized Lander's "optimistic and sentimental view" of Lincoln's attitudes on race, but praised the book's "readable style" and concluded "This is a book that should be read, discussed, and enjoyed."&lt;ref name=hansen&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-2808412841/lincoln-darwin-shared-visions-of-race-science|title=[Review of ''Lincoln and Darwin: Shared Visions of Race, Science, and Religion'' by James Lander]|work=[[Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society]]|first=Stephen L.|last=Hansen|volume=105|issue=2/3|year=2012|accessdate=July 4, 2015|pages=259+|subscription=yes|doi=10.5406/jillistathistsoc.105.2-3.0259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Largent, writing in ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'' described ''Lincoln and Darwin'' as "a strange project", but nonetheless "quite engaging because it allows Lander to bring into focus broad questions about the relationship between individuals and their contexts as well as some specific questions about mid-nineteenth-century Western thought."&lt;ref name=largent&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=10.1086/670110|title=[Review of ''Lincoln and Darwin: Shared Visions of Race, Science, and Religion'' by James Lander]|work=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|first=Mark|last=Largent|volume=103|issue=4|year=2012|pages=801–802|subscription=yes|doi=10.1086/670110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Turley, writing in ''American Nineteenth Century History'', observed that the book contains little original research and questioned the coherence of its themes "applied to Lincoln and Darwin ''together''", but praised "Lander's lucid, succinct, and up-to-date accounts of the topics that he deploys to illustrate his protagonists' involvement with his three main themes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14664658.2012.746388|title=[Review of ''Lincoln and Darwin: Shared Visions of Race, Science, and Religion'' by James Lander]|work=American Nineteenth Century History|first=David|last=Turley|volume=13|issue=3|year=2012|accessdate=July 3, 2015|pages=421–423|subscription=yes|doi=10.1080/14664658.2012.746388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of [[clone (computer science)|clone]]s of [[Sinclair Research]]'s [[ZX Spectrum]] [[home computer]]:

== Official clones ==
[[Image:Timex Sinclair 2068 Manipulated.jpg|thumb|right|The Timex Sinclair 2068]]

The only official clones of the Spectrum were made by [[Timex Sinclair|Timex]]. There were three models developed, only two of which were released:

=== Timex Sinclair 2068 ===
{{main|Timex Sinclair 2068}}
A significantly more sophisticated machine than the original Spectrum. The most significant changes were the addition of a cartridge port, an [[AY-3-8912]] sound chip and an improved [[Gate array|ULA]] giving access to better graphics modes. The TS2068 was marketed in the [[United States]], while very similar machines were marketed in [[Portugal]] and [[Poland]] as the Timex Computer 2068 (TC2068) and Unipolbrit [[Komputer 2086]] (UK2086) respectively. A small amount of TC2068 were also sold in Poland.

=== Timex Computer 2048 ===
{{main|Timex Computer 2048}}
A machine similar to the Spectrum 48K, but with the improved ULA from the TC2068 allowing access to the improved graphics modes. Marketed only in Portugal and Poland.

=== Timex Sinclair 2048 ===
{{main|Timex Sinclair 2048}}
A never released variant of the TS2068 with 16&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KB]] of RAM.

== Unofficial clones ==

=== ATM ===
{{Main|ATM (computer)}}
ATM (ATM Turbo) was developed in [[Moscow]], in 1991, by two firms, MicroArt and ATM. It has [[Z80]] at 7&amp;nbsp;MHz, 1024&amp;nbsp;KB [[RAM]], 128&amp;nbsp;KB [[Read-only memory|ROM]], [[AY-3-8910|AY-8910]] (two ones in upgraded models), [[8-bit]] [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]], 8-bit 8-channel [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]], [[RS-232]], [[Centronics]], [[Beta Disk Interface]], [[Advanced Technology Attachment|IDE]] interface, [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|AT]]/[[IBM PC XT|XT]] keyboard, text mode (80×25, 16 possible colours, 8×8 pattern), and three graphics modes.

=== AZX-Monstrum ===
An open project to build a ZX Spectrum compatible computer. The CPU is [[Zilog Z380]] (a [[32-bit]] version of the Z80, capable of running at 40&amp;nbsp;MHz), it has its own graphic adapter, AT-keyboard, own BIOS and extended BASIC-ROM, and [[RAM]] expandable up to 4GB linear. The computer is supposed to be almost 100% compatible. Standard devices of are HDD-controller, DMA vs IRQ controller, ROM-Task Switching and more. So far only the HDD-controller is produced but the rest exists as drawings. All the plans are freely available.

=== Baltica ===
A Russian clone of the 48K ZX Spectrum. ULA replacement made with K556PT4 and K155PE3. CPU running at a higher frequency (4&amp;nbsp;MHz) which made it less compatible.

=== Best III ===
A ZX Spectrum clone made in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1993. The size of the system unit is 16.8 × 10 × 2½&amp;nbsp;inches. It even uses a Russian Z80 clone as CPU.

=== Bi Am ZX-Spectrum 48/64 and 128 ===
A Russian clone of the ZX Spectrum. The name of the Bi Am ZX-Spectrum 48/64 suggests that it comes with 64&amp;nbsp;KB RAM. The size of the system unit is 10 × 8.4 × 2&amp;nbsp;inches. Made of metal. Has the sign Made in RF (Russian Federation) at the back. It was produced in 1992–1994.

The Bi Am ZX-Spectrum 128 was a 128&amp;nbsp;KB version of the same computer.

=== Cobra ===
A ZX Spectrum clone built in [[Braşov]], [[Romania]].[http://www.homecomputer.de/pages/easteurope_ro.html][http://www.homecomputer.de/images/infos/east-europe/Cobra_de.txt]&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/the-underground-story-of-cobra-the-1980s-illicit-handmade-computer/ Ars Technica: The underground story of Cobra, the 1980s’ illicit handmade computer]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CIP-03 ===
A Romanian ZX Spectrum clone made by Intreprinderea Electronica. It is called 'Calculator pentru Instruire Personală' which means 'computer for personal teaching'. The keyboard looks nice, but the key switches are very simple and therefore so is the 'feeling'. A nicely built PCB with 45 chips (most 74-family) inside. The ROM is original Sinclair, although instead of the Sinclair copyright message, it states 'BASIC S'. Only one set of 8× 1-bit 64&amp;nbsp;KB RAMs present. The power supply is the size and weight of a couple of bricks including a huge transformer unlike the now-standard switching power supply.

=== Composite ===
A Russian clone of the ZX Spectrum with 48&amp;nbsp;KB RAM.[http://www.homecomputer.de/pages/f_info.html?Composite.html]. It is a modified version of [[Leningrad (computer)|Leningrad 2]], produced by co-op Composite.

=== Czerweny CZ ===
The Czerweny CZ 2000, Czerweny CZ Spectrum and Czerweny CZ Spectrum Plus were Argentinian produced clones.

=== Delta ===
A [[Russia]]n clone of ZX Spectrum+ manufactured in 1991, at a former military plant, near the city of [[Zelenograd]]. Fully compatible with the Spectrum+, the Delta came equipped with 48&amp;nbsp;KB of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], video output, cassette in/out, two joysticks ports (both [[Kempston joystick|Kempston]] and Sinclair), RGB adjustment controls, and its own expansion port for Russian hardware.

The Delta originally sold for about 620DM, and sold very well: for a few months it was on the bestseller list in the region.

At least in Czechoslovakia the machines sold under the name Delta around 1986, were re-badged unsold ZX Spectrum+ from the UK. As they were actually ZX Spectrum+ they resemble no further similarities with the Russian clone. Various stickers cover up hints of made in the UK and official Sinclair badging. It was coming with an original English user guide along with very good translation and the original cassette of the game Chequered Flag. [http://zone.bomberoza.net/Autres%20ordinateurs/Spectrum/Delta/Delta.htm more]

Possibly related to Delta S-128.

=== Delta S-128 ===
A Russian clone of ZX Spectrum built in Voronezh, Kazan and other cities since 1990 that can run at up to 7&amp;nbsp;MHz. Comes with kempston and sinclair joystick ports and ports both for TV and RGB monitor. It has a printer interface and sound processor. As it is a modular design you can add disk controller.

=== Delta SA and Delta SB ===
These were derivatives from the "Delta" series. Changes included more relaxed hardware planning, bigger case and partially non compatible ROM. The machine had built-in Russification feature, which was toggling charset to Russian when pressing the dedicated key (Sending BASIC code #209), and back to English charset (Sending BASIC code#210). These changes dissallow any floppy drive usage with these clones, and also, a lot of hacked titles, using famous "Hacked by Bill Gilbert" loader, will not launch. Later, corrected rom was released, which while still not able to work with floppy, was more compatible with game titles, but still not was fully compatible, games like "Pole Position" or "Starfox" will crash after loading. Additional changes were introduced in "Delta SB", it has extended ROM, and came with 4 game titles pre-built in. These titles were selected by additional hardware switches, located at top left side of computer. Pressing any of them will cause immediate reset and load of the corresponding title. Included titles generally vary, but most popular were: "Commando", "Astro Marine Corps", "Dan Dare 3", "Star Invaders 2".

Some of these clones were manufactured in Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia, at currently abandoned Military Scientific Plant "Skhivi". No references to real manufacturer was given, and all data refer like this was an original product from Zelenograd. The difference may be noted by the correction table of user manual. In original manual, it was hand written and rotoscoped, the Georgian release included computer typed correction list.

=== Didaktik ===
{{Main|Didaktik}}
The Didaktik was a series of home computers produced in Skalica, former [[Czechoslovakia]], now [[Slovakia]]. Later models compatible with ZX Spectrum were based on the [[U880]] and [[Zilog Z80]] [[central processing unit|processors]].
There were three main models of Didaktik ZX clones:  First was Didaktik Gama (released in three variants 87, 88 and 89). Didaktik Gama has 80KB RAM comparing to original ZX spectrum. Gama-series was soon followed by the Didaktik M (first variant released at 1990 second variant release at 1991), M contain much better keyboard and Sinclair and Kempston Joystick ports.  Last ZX spectrum compatible model was Didaktik Kompakt (1991) which has integrated 3,5 Floppy disk mechanic and sound chipAY-3–8920 and still 48KB of RAM.

=== Dubna 48K ===
{{Main|Dubna 48K}}
A [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] clone of the ZX Spectrum home computer. It was based on an analogue of the Zilog Z80 [[microprocessor]]. Its name comes from [[Dubna]], a town near Moscow where it was produced, and "48K" stands for 48&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KB]]s of RAM.

=== Ella Ra ===
Also known as the Elara-Disk 128 was a Russian clone of the 128K ZX Spectrum with 58-key keyboard, disk drive, kempston and sinclair joystick. It is possible to expand it but it's slightly incompatible due to some ports are changed.[http://zx.interface1.net/clones/ellara.html][http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/clones/russian.htm]

=== Elwro 800 Junior ===
[[Image:Elwro 800 calosc.jpg|thumb|Elwro 800 Junior system]]
[[Image:Elwro 804 Junior 1.JPG|thumb|Elwro 804 Junior PC]]

Polish clones of the ZX Spectrum. It had a full size keyboard and even a paper holder. The reason it has a paper holder is that the case was originally designed for a small electric organ. A disk drive was available and there also was a version of CP/M called CP\J for this machine. The updated 804 Junior PC had an internal 3.5" diskdrive.

In [[Poland]] the computer that won a contest for being the school computer - "Elwro 800 Junior" used  [[DIN connector]]s for monitor output, cassette adapter, and Junet. Junet had two inputs - in and out(like MIDI). Student computers connected by  DIN cables to the teacher's computer, which had the costly floppy drive and printer. Other uses of Junet were for sending messages, or to allow the teacher to see what students are doing on their screens, at the teacher's computer.  The computer had also optional Spectrum net, but it was simple jack input/output. To send data the user had to do SAVE on cassette in Spectrum mode, and input had to be connected to Timex/Spectrum. Other ports used [[D-subminiature]] connectors, for RGB video, joystick, printer, and floppy drive. &lt;ref&gt;Arthur Tatnall, Bill Davey, ''Reflections on the History of Computers in Education: Early Use of Computers and Teaching about Computing in Schools'', Springer, 2014 {{ISBN|364255119X}} pp.277-281&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Felix HC series ===
A series of ZX Spectrum clones was manufactured in Romania from 1985 to 1994, by ICE Felix. The designation HC means Home Computer, and for the first three models in the series, the number is the year of first manufacture. Models in the series were: HC 85, HC 88, HC 90, HC 91, HC91+ (HC128), [[:ro:HC#HC 2000|HC 2000]], HC386.

The earliest version, HC 85, closely resembled the Spectrum, with a built-in [[BASIC]] interpreter, Z80A processor, 48&amp;nbsp;KB RAM, tape, and TV interfaces.&lt;Ref&gt;[http://www.csit-sun.pub.ro/research/history/HC%2085.pdf Microcalculatorul personal HC-85.], Authors: A. Petrescu, F. Iacob, T. Domocos, T. Mihu, E. Dobrovie&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in schools/universities and as a personal computer.

An optional Interface 1 extension was available for the HC 85, HC 90, and HC 91.  It was functionally similar to the [[ZX Interface 1]], but instead of Microdrives it supported single-density or double-density floppy disks.

The HC 90 had a redesigned circuit board supporting fewer, larger memory chips; it was functionally equivalent with the HC 85.

The HC 91 had a modified keyboard with 50 keys instead of 40.  It had 64&amp;nbsp;KB RAM and extra circuitry which provided [[CP/M]] support, if the Interface 1 extension was also present.

The HC 2000 (manufactured from 1992–94) had a built-in 3.5-inch 720&amp;nbsp;KB disk, and 64&amp;nbsp;KB RAM, it could be used both as a Spectrum clone with added disk functionality (only 48&amp;nbsp;KB RAM available) or in CP/M mode, giving access to the full 64&amp;nbsp;KB memory.  Essentially, it brought the HC 91, Interface 1, and floppy disk in a single case.

The last model to be made in the Z80 line was the HC91+. It was a ZX Spectrum 128K clone in a HC91 case and keyboard and had some compatibility problems. For the first time, the AY-8910 sound chip was offered as an add-on service and was soldered on the board by factory technicians. Demoscene demos had problems running multi-colour effects and displaying sound VU-meter like effects lacking some data from the AY chip probably.

=== GrandRomMax ===
A Russian clone of the ZX Spectrum made in 1993 in Moscow. It is very similar to the [[Pentagon (computer)|Pentagon]] but INT is re-made to be like the original. There exists four or five models of it but there are only minor differences between them, for instance one has wrong released turbo Beta Disk interface so when you read/write disks on your own GRM everything is normal, but when you want to save something to this disk on any another machine then all information on disk will be destroyed. They are not easy to expand because of some PLM (small ones) chips inside which does not allow you take some signals you may need to attach modem, etc.

The GRM2+ board was used to create the GrandBoard2+

=== Grandboard 2+ ===
A Russian clone of ZX Spectrum. The size is 350×280×35&amp;nbsp;mm (13.2 × 8.4 × 2&amp;nbsp;inches). Developed and manufactured from 1994, by Independent Science-Manufacturing Laboratory of Computer Techniques in city Frajzino. Based on board [[GrandRomMax|GRM2+]]

=== Harlequin ===
A UK clone of the 48K ZX Spectrum, designed and developed by Chris Smith to aid the reverse engineering of the ZX Spectrum custom ULA chip, and its [http://www.zxdesign.info/vidresearch.shtml research documentation]. Complete in 2008, it is the first 100% timing compatible clone. Until 2012/13 the Harlequin existed only as a [http://www.zxdesign.info/images/prototype/fullBoard.jpg breadboard prototype], but recently, José Leandro Martínez, Ingo Truppel and others produced a limited number of PCB versions ([http://trastero.speccy.org/cosas/JL/Harlequin/superfo1.html documented here]) as an exact board replacement for an actual ZX Spectrum.

=== HT 3080C ===
A Hungarian ZX Spectrum clone made by Híradástechnikai Szövetkezet, released in 1986. It was the third computer from the company. The two first computers HT 1080Z and HT 2080Z were clones of [[TRS-80]] and were unsuccessful because of the poor graphics features and high price. They were both school computers. In 1986, in Hungary the school computers have to fulfill new requirements: they have to produce high resolution graphics and support the special Hungarian characters. That's why the HT 3080C came out and it was both compatible with the previous HT machines as well as the ZX Spectrum. You could switch between TRS-80 and ZX Spectrum mode. It had a graphics resolution of 256x192 (standard Speccy) and an AY-chip for sound (to be compatible with the previous HT machines, not with the 128K Spectrum). ROM: 32&amp;nbsp;KB (Speccy+HT ROMs), RAM: 64&amp;nbsp;KB (possibly also a requirement for Hungarian school computers, because all school computers in Hungary had 64&amp;nbsp;KB). It had a Commodore serial port so you could also connect peripherals made for the C64 to it, for instance the 1541 disk drive.

=== Hobbit ===
{{main|Hobbit (computer)}}

A Soviet/Russian [[8-bit]] home computer, based on the Sinclair Research ZX Spectrum hardware architecture. It also featured a CP/M mode and [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] mode or [[Logo programming language|LOGO]] mode, with the Forth or LOGO operating environment residing in an on-board ROM chip.

=== Inves Spectrum 48k plus ===
A clone of the ZX Spectrum+ from Investronica in Spain. Released after [[Amstrad]] bought [[Sinclair Research Ltd]]. Looked much like a normal 48+. It has compatibility problems with some games ([[Bombjack]], [[Commando]], ''[[Top Gun (video game)|Top Gun]]'', etc.). On the rear there was a Kempston joystick connector.

=== JET ===
A Romanian clone. The casing was adapted from a telephone.

'''Kvorum 128+''' was as the Kvorum 128 but comes with built-in 3.5" drive.

=== Leningrad ===
A series of two Russian clones of the ZX Spectrum.

In 1989, came '''Leningrad 1''' a clone of the 48K which came to be the cheapest of the mass-made clones. They attempted to make the design as simple as possible and more compact. The only addition was a joystick port. It was designed by [[Sergey Zonov]] who later went on and created the [[Scorpion (computer)|Scorpion]].

'''Leningrad 2''' came in 1991. The joystick was changed to Kempston compatible and the keyboard was much improved. It sold in great numbers.

=== Master ===
A clone of the ZX Spectrum made in Russia in 1990. It runs at 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz with 48&amp;nbsp;KB RAM. It has ports for Sinclair and Kempston joysticks. The name suggests it's related to Master K11

=== Microdigital TK90X ===
{{main|TK90X}}
The '''TK90X''' was the first [[Brazil]]ian ZX Spectrum clone made in 1985, by [[Microdigital Eletronica]], a company located at [[São Paulo]], Brazil, that manufactured some [[Sinclair ZX81|ZX81]] clones before (TK82, [[TK82C]], TK83 and [[TK85]]) and a [[Sinclair ZX80|ZX80]] clone (TK80). The ROM were hacked to allow an UDG editor and accented characters (incompatibility issues are very rare or none). The keyboard membrane is more resistant than the original from ZX-Spectrum 48K (very similar to the actual PS2/USB keyboard we use now), and there is also a Sinclair-compatible joystick connector between expansion and mic/ear connectors.

=== Microdigital TK95 ===
{{main|TK95}}
The '''TK95''' [[microcomputer]] was the evolution of [[TK90X]] made in the 1980s, by Microdigital Eletronica, a company located at São Paulo, Brazil that manufactured some ZX81 clones before (TK82, TK82C, [[TK83]] and TK85) and a ZX80 clone (TK80). The first version was launched in November 1986. This "evolution" was mostly "cosmetic" at the keyboard and whole ABS plastic case. The board is exactly the same as the [[TK90X]] and its 16&amp;nbsp;KB ROM has only minor differences.

=== Mistrum ===
A Czech clone of the 48K ZX Spectrum. The ROM include Roman chars and Roman chars with Czech diacritic marks. As the Mistum was a is a hardware design they may look very different as each builder made his own case and keyboard. An article on how to build a Mistrum was published in the Czechoslovak amateur radio magazine ''Amatérské Radio'' nr 1/89.

=== Moskva ===
'''Moskva''' was the name of two ZX Spectrum clones.

'''Moskva 48K''' (Москва/Moscow) was the first mass-produced clone of the 48K Spectrum in Russia. It was first made in 1988.

'''Moskva 128K''' was a faithful clone of ZX Spectrum 128K with built-in printer interface, joystick, TV/RGB port but without sound processor and disk drive. It was first made in 1989.

=== Nafanja ===
A Russian ZX Spectrum clone from 1990, designed for transport in a case. It was made for diplomatic offices and children. It is compatible with [[Dubna 48K]] and has a [[joystick]] port. At the time of launch time the price was 650 [[rouble]]s.

=== Profi ===
A Soviet ZX Spectrum clone developed in 1991, in Moscow by Kondor and Kramis.

It has Z80 at 7&amp;nbsp;MHz, up to 1024&amp;nbsp;KB RAM, 64&amp;nbsp;KB ROM, Centronics, [[AY8910]] sound chip, [[Beta 128]] disc interface, [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] interface, and 512x240 multi-colour (i.e. two possible colours per 8×1 block) graphics mode for CP/M.

Users liked to plug in two 8-bit DACs to play 4-channel modules of [[Scream Tracker]].

It was possible to run CP/M and a graphics mode with 512x240 pixels was added to be able to run 80 characters per row. It has both parallel and serial ports, sound processor and the possibility to use an IBM keyboard. In later issues it also had a hard disk interface and turbo mode.

=== RR-Spectrum ===
A East-German private clone of the ZX Spectrum. [http://ralf-rathgeber.de/zx-spectrum-clone.html]

=== Santaka 002 ===
A clone of ZX Spectrum Plus produced in 1990 in [[Lithuania]]. It has Russian symbols instead of lower case English and is reported to be a good and reliable machine because it was produced by ex-military plants as a part of conversion program.

=== Scorpion ZS-256 ===
'''Scorpion''' ({{lang-ru|Скорпион}}), was a very widespread ZX Spectrum clone produced in [[St. Petersburg]], Russia by Sergey Zonov. It had a Z80 processor and from 256 to 1024&amp;nbsp;KB memory, the Shadow Service Monitor (debugger) in the basic ROM activated by pressing the Magic Button (NMI), a ProfROM with additional included ZX-Word editor, a clock, HDD utilities and more. Various extensions were produced, including [[SMUC]] — adapter of [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] and [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] slots, which allowed the use of [[IBM PC compatible]] [[hard drive]]s and extension cards.

=== Sever (Nord) 48/002 ===
A Russian clone of the ZX Spectrum. It was made in 1990 and comes with 64&amp;nbsp;KB RAM and 16&amp;nbsp;KB ROM. The size of the system unit is 12x8x2½&amp;nbsp;inches, the weight is 1.5&amp;nbsp;kg.

=== Sintez and -Sintez- ===
A Soviet clone of the ZX Spectrum developed in the "Signal" factory within the Moldovan SSR in 1989.

The original Sintez resembled the "Spectrum +" model, while the -Sintez- was an improved version with a more common mechanical keyboard, an added serial port, as well as the ability for an 8080 or related processor (for example 8255) to be added and used together with the UA 880. 

While it was software compatible with ZX Spectrum 48K and has two Interface 2 joystick ports, its hardware was quite different, utilizing different memory chip set-up, lacking slowdown when accessing certain areas of memory, as in original ZX Spectrum, so, certain applications and games may not behave correctly or crash.

=== Spectral ===
An East-German clone of the ZX Spectrum. It came with built in joystick interface and either 48 or 128&amp;nbsp;KB RAM. It was sold in kit form by [[Hübner Elektronik]].

'''Messestadt Riem''' (literally: Convention City Riem) is an urban district in the east of [[Munich]]. It is part of the [[Trudering-Riem|municipality 15 Trudering-Riem]], and located entirely on the grounds of the 1992 abandoned [[Munich-Riem airport]] and includes today, along with a residential area, the [[Neue Messe München]] trade fair center and the [[Riem Arcaden]] [[shopping mall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.toytowngermany.com/wiki/Messestadt | title=Messestadt | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Toytown Germany | language= | accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Messestadt Riem is, after [[Freiham]], the second youngest district of Munich. After the flight operation was moved in 1992 to the new [[Munich Airport]], the old airport building in Riem could be emptied and the construction of the new exhibition center started from the mid-1990s, with the corresponding [[rapid transit]] connections in the following years. In 1998, the fair could finally move out of their exhibition halls on the [[Theresienhöhe]] to the spacious new building in the fair city. Many other companies also moved and established themselves on the former airport site.
Immediately west of the west entrance, the ''Messesee'' (Fair lake) was created, 390 m long (north-south) and 46 to 94 m wide (east-west), with a water area of 2.6 [[hectare]].

In the southern part of the former airport a development area with rental apartments and condominiums was created. With the Riem Arcaden, shopping for daily items is easily accomplished, and because of the numerous pedestrian zones, many kindergartens and three primary schools the fair site is a suitable location for young families to live. The first projects for car-free living in Munich have been established here since 1998.
The first multi-family passive house and the first multifamily zero-energy house in Munich were created here.

== Riemer Park ==
South of the residential area is the Riemer Park. In 2005, the [[Bundesgartenschau]] was held here after Munich won the corresponding competition in 2000. For this purpose Riemer Park, a large landscaped park, was built in 2002. After the Bundesgartenschau Riemer Park, the third largest park in the city of Munich, was opened to the public as a recreation area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mrlodge.com/muenchen-info/suburb-information/messestadt-riem/ | title=Messestadt Riem | author= | date= | website=mrlodge.com | publisher= | language= | accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With enormous effort, a lake was created in its center, known under the name Buga Lake (officially Riemer lake). The lake is east to west 800 m long, 150 m wide, 10 ha in size, up to 18 m deep and contains 100,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water. It is an upscale ground water reserve, which can also be used for bathing. Because the water table is too low in the area and also varies greatly seasonally, a concrete trough was applied and the three pumps, each pumping a constant 40 liters of water per second into the lake, stopping the water from accumulating and causing flooding in the basements of surrounding residential buildings, among other things a drain pipe was laid under the sea. On the east bank there is a beach, while on the west bank, where a pedestrian bridge leads over the lake, a sedimentation zone was created with aquatic plants. Located near the west bank is two more, shallow sedimentation basins with water plants that are only 1100 and 800 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size.

== Churches ==
In 2005, in the West of Messestadt Riem, an ecumenical church center where the Protestant St. Sophia and the Catholic St. Florian churches were dedicated and opened. 

== Transportation ==
Messestadt Riem is connected to two rapid transport stations of [[Munich U-Bahn]], as well as, the bus lines 139, 186, 189, 190 and N74. The [[Bundesautobahn 94|Autobahn 94]] passes to the north of the fair city. Discussions are ongoing about a railway connection to Messestadt Riem as part of the [[Erding Ring Closure]] to the airport.

A metamodel or surrogate model is a model of a model, and metamodeling is the process of generating such metamodels. Thus '''metamodeling''' or '''meta-modeling''' is the analysis, construction and development of the frames, rules, constraints, models and theories applicable and useful for [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] a predefined class of problems. As its name implies, this concept applies the notions of [[meta-]] and modeling in [[software engineering]] and [[systems engineering]]. Metamodels are of many types and have diverse applications.&lt;ref&gt; [[Saraju Mohanty]], Chapter 12 Metamodel-Based Fast AMS-SoC Design Methodologies, "[http://www.mhprofessional.com/product.php?isbn=0071825711 Nanoelectronic Mixed-Signal System Design]", {{ISBN|978-0071825719}} and 0071825711, 1st Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A metamodel or surrogate model is a model of the model, i.e. a simplified model of an actual model of a circuit, system, or software like entity.&lt;ref&gt; Oleg Garitselov, [[Saraju Mohanty]], and Elias Kougianos, "[http://www.cse.unt.edu/~smohanty/Publications_Journals/2012/Mohanty_IEEE-TSM-2012Feb.pdf A Comparative Study of Metamodels for Fast and Accurate Simulation of Nano-CMOS Circuits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211500/http://www.cse.unt.edu/~smohanty/Publications_Journals/2012/Mohanty_IEEE-TSM-2012Feb.pdf |date=23 September 2015 }}", IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), Vol. 25, No. 1, February 2012, pp. 26–36. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Saraju Mohanty]] [http://www.cse.unt.edu/~smohanty/Presentations/2012/Mohanty_SRC-TxACE_Talk_2012-04-27.pdf Ultra-Fast Design Exploration of Nanoscale Circuits through Metamodeling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211443/http://www.cse.unt.edu/~smohanty/Presentations/2012/Mohanty_SRC-TxACE_Talk_2012-04-27.pdf |date=23 September 2015 }}, Invited Talk, Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC), Texas Analog Center for Excellence (TxACE), 27 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt; Metamodel can be a mathematical relation or algorithm representing input and output relations. A [[model (abstract)|model]] is an abstraction of phenomena in the [[Real life (reality)|real world]];  a metamodel is yet another abstraction, highlighting properties of the model itself.  A model conforms to its metamodel in the way that a computer program conforms to the grammar of the programming language in which it is written. Various types of metamodels include polynomial equations, neural network, [[Kriging]], etc. "Metamodeling" is the construction of a collection of "concepts" (things, terms, etc.) within a certain domain. Metamodeling typically involves studying the output and input relationships and then fitting right metamodels to represent that behavior.  

Common uses for metamodels are:
* As a [[logical schema|schema]] for [[semantic]] data that needs to be exchanged or stored
* As a language that supports a particular method or process
* As a language to express additional semantics of existing information
* As a mechanism to create tools that work with a broad class of models at run time
* As a schema for modeling and automatically exploring sentences of a language with applications to automated test synthesis
* As an approximation of a higher-fidelity model for use when reducing computational cost is necessary

Because of the "meta" character of metamodeling, both the [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] and theory of metamodels are of relevance to [[wikt:metascience|metascience]], [[metaphilosophy]], [[metatheory|metatheories]] and [[systemics]], and meta-consciousness.  The concept can be useful in [[mathematics]], and has practical applications in [[computer science]] and [[computer engineering]]/[[software engineering]]. The latter are the main focus of this article.

=== Definition ===
In [[software engineering]], the use of [[model (abstract)|model]]s is an alternative to more common code-based development techniques. A model always conforms to a unique metamodel. One of the currently most active branch of [[Model Driven Engineering]] is the approach named [[model-driven architecture]] proposed by [[Object Management Group|OMG]]. This approach is based on the utilization of a language to write metamodels called the [[Meta-Object Facility|Meta Object Facility or MOF]]. Typical metamodels proposed by [[Object Management Group|OMG]] are [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], [[SysML]], SPEM or CWM. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] has also published the standard metamodel [[ISO/IEC 24744]].&lt;ref&gt;International Organization for Standardization / International Electrotechnical Commission, 2007. [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38854 ISO/IEC 24744]. Software Engineering - Metamodel for Development Methodologies.&lt;/ref&gt; All the languages presented below could be defined as MOF metamodels.

=== Metadata modeling ===
[[Metadata modeling]] is a type of metamodeling used in [[software engineering]] and [[systems engineering]] for the analysis and construction of models applicable and useful to some predefined class of problems. (see also: [[data modeling]]).

=== Model transformations ===
One important move in [[Model Driven Engineering]] is the systematic use of [[Model Transformation Language]]s. The OMG has proposed a standard for this called [[QVT]] for Queries/Views/Transformations. [[QVT]] is based on the [[Meta-Object Facility]] or MOF. Among many other [[Model Transformation Language]]s (MTLs), some examples of implementations of this standard are AndroMDA, [[VIATRA]], [[Tefkat]], [[MT (Model Transformation Language)|MT]], [[ManyDesigns Portofino]].

=== Relationship to ontologies ===
Meta-models are closely related to [[Ontology (computer science)|ontologies]]. Both are often used to describe and analyze the relations between concepts&lt;ref&gt;E. Söderström, et al. (2001) "Towards a Framework for Comparing Process Modelling Languages", in: ''Lecture Notes In Computer Science''; Vol. 2348. Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering. Pages: 600 – 611, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ontologies: express something meaningful within a specified universe or [[domain of discourse]] by utilizing a grammar for using vocabulary. The grammar specifies what it means to be a well-formed statement, assertion, query, etc. (formal constraints) on how terms in the ontology’s controlled vocabulary can be used together.&lt;ref name=PidcockArticle&gt;

* Meta-modeling: can be considered as an ''explicit'' description (constructs and rules) of how a domain-specific model is built. In particular, this comprises a formalized specification of the domain-specific notations. Typically, metamodels are – and always should follow - a strict rule set.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Types of metamodels ===
For software engineering, several ''types'' of models (and their corresponding modeling activities) can be distinguished:
*[[Metadata modeling]] (MetaData Model)
*[[Meta-Process Modeling]] (MetaProcess Model)
*Executable Meta-Modeling (combining both of the above and much more, as in the general purpose tool [[Kermeta]])
*[[Model Transformation Language]] (see below)

*[[Neural network]] Metamodels
*[[Kriging]] Metamodels
*[[Piecewise Polynomial (Spline) Metamodels]]
*[[Gradient-Enhanced Kriging (GEK)]]

=== Zoos of metamodels ===
A library of similar metamodels has been called a Zoo of metamodels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metamodel.com/wisme-2004/present/22.pdf Jean-Marie Favre: Towards a Basic Theory to Model Driven Engineering.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015181841/http://www.metamodel.com/wisme-2004/present/22.pdf |date=15 October 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are several types of meta-model zoos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclipse.org/gmt/am3/zoos/ AtlanticZoo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060429205711/http://www.eclipse.org/gmt/am3/zoos/ |date=29 April 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are expressed in ECore. Others are written in [[Meta-Object Facility|MOF]] 1.4 - [[XML Metadata Interchange|XMI]] 1.2. The metamodels expressed in [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]-[[XML Metadata Interchange|XMI]]1.2 may be uploaded in [[Poseidon for UML]], a [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[computer-aided software engineering|CASE]] tool.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5933">In [[information theory]], the principle of '''minimum Fisher information (MFI)''' is a [[variational principle]] which, when applied with the proper constraints needed to reproduce empirically known expectation values, determines the best [[probability distribution]] that characterizes the system.  (See also [[Fisher information]].)

== Measures of information ==
[[Measurement#Information theory|Information measures]] (IM) are the most important tools of [[information theory]]. They measure either the amount of positive information or of "missing" information an observer possesses with regards to any system of interest. The most famous IM is the so-called [[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon-entropy]]  (1948), which determines how much additional information the observer still requires in order to have all the available knowledge regarding a given system S, when all he/she has is a [[probability density function]] (PD) defined on appropriate elements of such system. This is then a "missing" information measure. The IM is a function of the PD only. If the observer does not have such
a PD, but only a finite set of empirically determined mean values of the system, then a fundamental scientific principle called the [[Principle of maximum entropy|Maximum Entropy]] one (MaxEnt) asserts that the "best" PD is the one that, reproducing the known expectation values, maximizes otherwise Shannon's IM.

== Fisher's information measure ==
[[Fisher information|Fisher's information]] (FIM), named after [[Ronald Fisher]], (1925) is another kind of measure, in two respects, namely,

1) it reflects the amount of (positive) information of the observer,&lt;br /&gt;
2) it depends not only on the PD but also on its first derivatives, a property that makes it a local quantity (Shannon's is instead a global one).

The corresponding counterpart of MaxEnt is now the FIM-minimization, since Fisher's measure grows when Shannon's diminishes, and vice versa. The minimization here referred to (MFI) is an important theoretical tool in a manifold of disciplines, beginning with [[physics]]. In a sense it is clearly superior to MaxEnt because the later procedure yields always as the solution an exponential PD, while the MFI solution is a [[differential equation]] for the PD, which allows for greater flexibility and versatility.

== Applications of the MFI ==

=== Thermodynamics ===
Much effort has been devoted to Fisher's information measure, shedding much light upon the manifold physical applications.&lt;ref&gt;B. R. Frieden, ''Science from Fisher Information'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. R. Frieden, Am. J. Phys. 57 (1989) 1004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. R. Frieden, Phys. Lett. A 169 (1992) 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. R. Frieden, in Advances in Imaging and Electron Physics, edited by P. W. Hawkes, Academic, New York, 1994, Vol. 90, pp. 123204.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. R. Frieden, Physica A 198 (1993) 262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. R. Frieden and R. J. Hughes, Phys. Rev. E 49 (1994) 2644.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Nikolov and B. R. Frieden, Phys. Rev. E 49 (1994) 4815.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. R. Frieden, Phys. Rev. A 41 (1990) 4265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. R. Frieden and B. H. Soffer, Phys. Rev. E 52 (1995) 2274.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. R. Frieden, Found. Phys. 21 (1991) 757.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Silver, in E. T. Jaynes: Physics and Probability, edited by W. T. Grandy, Jr. and [[P. W. Milonni]], Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Plastino, A. R. Plastino, H. G. Miller, and F. C. Khana, Phys. Lett. A 221 (1996) 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. R. Plastino and A. Plastino, Phys. Rev. E 54 (1996) 4423.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. R. Plastino, A. Plastino, and H. G. Miller, Phys. Rev. E 56 (1997) 3927.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Plastino, A. R. Plastino, and H. G. Miller, Phys. Lett. A 235 (1997) 129.&lt;/ref&gt; As a small sample, it can be shown that the whole field of [[thermodynamics]] (both [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] and [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|non-equilibrium]]) can be derived from the MFI approach.&lt;ref&gt;B. R. Frieden, A. Plastino, A. R. Plastino, and B. H. Soffer, Phys. Rev. E 60 (1999) 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Here FIM is specialized to the particular but important case of translation families, i.e., distribution functions whose form does not change under translational transformations. In this case, Fisher measure becomes shift-invariant. Such minimizing of Fisher's measure leads to a [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger-like equation]] for the probability amplitude, where the ground state describes equilibrium physics and the excited states account for non-equilibrium situations.&lt;ref&gt;B. R. Frieden, A. Plastino, A. R. Plastino, and B. H. Soffer, Phys. Rev. E 66 (2002) 046128.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scale-invariant phenomena ===
More recently, [[Zipf's law]] has been shown to arise as the variational solution of the MFI when [[scale invariance]] is introduced in the measure, leading for the first time an explanation of this regularity from [[first principle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Zipf’s law from a Fisher variational-principle A. Hernando, D. Puigdomènech, D. Villuendas, C. Vesperinas, A. Plastino,  to be published in Physics Letters A (https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.0501)&lt;/ref&gt; It has been also shown that MFI can be used to formulate a thermodynamics based on scale invariance instead of [[translational invariance]], allowing the definition of the [[Scale-Free Ideal Gas]], the scale invariant equivalent of the [[Ideal Gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hernando | first1 = A. | last2 = Vesperinas | first2 = C. | last3 = Plastino | first3 = A. | doi = 10.1016/j.physa.2009.09.054 | title = Fisher information and the thermodynamics of scale-invariant systems | journal = Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications | volume = 389 | issue = 3 | pages = 490 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0908.0504 |bibcode = 2010PhyA..389..490H }} ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.0504 ArXiv link])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neural Darwinism''', a large scale theory of [[brain function]] by [[Gerald Edelman]], was initially published in 1978, in a book called ''The Mindful Brain'' (MIT Press). It was extended and published in the 1987 book ''Neural Darwinism – The Theory of Neuronal Group Selection''.

In 1972, Edelman was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in Medicine or Physiology (shared with Rodney Porter of Great Britain) for his work in immunology showing how the population of [[lymphocyte]]s capable of binding to a foreign [[antigen]] is increased by differential clonal multiplication following antigen discovery. Essentially, this proved that the human body is capable of creating [[complex systems|complex adaptive systems]] as a result of local events with feedback. Edelman's interest in selective systems expanded into the fields of [[neurobiology]] and [[neurophysiology]], and in ''Neural Darwinism'', Edelman puts forth a theory called "neuronal group selection". It contains three major parts:
# Anatomical connectivity in the brain occurs via selective mechanochemical events that take place [[epigenetic]]ally during development. This creates a diverse '''primary repertoire''' by differential reproduction.
# Once structural diversity is established anatomically, a second selective process occurs during [[postnatal]] behavioral experience through epigenetic modifications in the strength of [[synapse|synaptic]] connections between neuronal groups. This creates a diverse '''secondary repertoire''' by differential amplification.
# [[Reentry (neural circuitry)|Reentrant]] signaling between neuronal groups allows for spatiotemporal continuity in response to real-world interactions. In "The Remembered Present" (1989) and later, "Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On the Matter of the Mind" (1992) and "A Universe of Consciousness: How Matter Becomes Imagination" (2001; coauthored with Giulio Tononi), Edelman argues that thalamocortical and corticocortical reentrant signaling are critical to generating and maintaining conscious states in mammals.

==Degeneracy==
With neuronal heterogeneity (by Edelman called ''degeneracy''), it is possible to test the many circuits (on the order of 30 billion neurons with an estimated one quadrillion connections between them in the human brain) with a diverse set of inputs, to see which neuronal groups respond "appropriately" statistically. Functional "distributed" (widespread) [[neuronal circuit|brain circuits]] thus emerge as a result.

Edelman goes into some detail about how [[brain development]] depends on a variety of [[cell adhesion molecules]] (CAMs) and [[substrate adhesion molecules]] (SAMs) on cell surfaces which allow cells to dynamically control their intercellular binding properties. This surface modulation allows cell collectives to effectively "signal" as the group aggregates, which helps govern [[morphogenesis]]. So morphology depends on CAM and SAM function. And CAM and SAM function also depend on developing morphology.

Edelman theorized that [[cell proliferation]], [[cell migration]], [[cell death]], neuron arbor distribution, and [[neurite]] branching are also governed by similar selective processes.

==Synaptic modification==
Once the basic variegated anatomical structure of the brain is laid down during early development, it is more or less fixed. But given the numerous and diverse collection of available circuitry, there are bound to be functionally equivalent albeit anatomically non-[[isomorphic]] neuronal groups capable of responding to certain sensory input. This creates a competitive environment where circuit groups proficient in their responses to certain inputs are "chosen" through the enhancement of the synaptic [[efficacy|efficacies]] of the selected network. This leads to an increased probability that the same network will respond to similar or identical signals at a future time. This occurs through the strengthening of neuron-to-neuron synapses. And these adjustments allow for [[neural plasticity]] along a fairly quick timetable.

==Reentry==
{{Main|Reentry (neural circuitry)}}

The last part of the theory attempts to explain how we experience spatiotemporal consistency in our interaction with environmental stimuli. Edelman called it "[[Reentry (neural circuitry)|reentry]]" and proposes a model of reentrant signaling whereby a disjunctive, multimodal sampling of the same stimulus event correlated in time leads to self-organizing intelligence. Put another way, multiple neuronal groups can be used to sample a given stimulus set in parallel and communicate between these disjunctive groups with incurred latency.

==Support==
It has been suggested{{by whom|date=June 2013}} that [[Friedrich Hayek]] had earlier proposed a similar idea in his book ''The Sensory Order: An Inquiry into the Foundations of Theoretical Psychology'', published in 1952 (Herrmann-Pillath, 1992). Other leading proponents include [[Jean-Pierre Changeux]], [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Linda B. Smith]]. [[William H. Calvin|William Calvin]] proposes true replication in the brain, whereas Edelman opposes the idea that there are true replicators in the brain.

==Criticism==
Criticism of Neural "[[Darwinism]]" was made by [[Francis Crick]] on the basis that neuronal groups are instructed by the environment rather than undergoing blind variation. A recent review by Fernando, Szathmary and Husbands explains why Edelman's Neural Darwinism is not Darwinian because it does not contain units of evolution as defined by [[John Maynard Smith]]. It is selectionist in that it satisfies the [[Price equation]], but there is no mechanism in Edelman's theory that explains how information can be transferred between neuronal groups.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando, Szathmary &amp; Husbands, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent theory called Evolutionary Neurodynamics being developed by [[Eors Szathmary]] and Chrisantha Fernando has proposed several means by which true replication may take place in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando, Karishma &amp; Szathmary, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; These neuronal models have been extended by Fernando in a later paper .&lt;ref&gt;Fernando, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In the most recent model, three plasticity mechanisms i) multiplicative STDP, ii) LTD, and iii) Heterosynaptic competition, are responsible for copying of connectivity patterns from one part of the brain to another. Exactly the same plasticity rules can explain experimental data for how infants do causal learning in the experiments conducted by Alison Gopnik. It has also been shown that by adding Hebbian learning to neuronal replicators the power of neuronal evolutionary computation may actually be greater than natural selection in organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando, Goldstein &amp; Szathmary, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==A more-micro variation==
[[Jean Piaget]] (1896–1980) often used the concept of the ''schème'' (a supposed unit of action-coding), which he left as an abstraction. However, later theorizing led to the hypothesis that such ''schèmes'' were probably RNA-like molecules, at least in their simplest cases. Such molecular sites would need to intercommunicate mainly via [[infra-red]] signals: messages which would be able to travel through fatty tissue such as [[myelin]], but would be blocked by water barriers (of &gt;20 microns). This "new" ''[R]-system'' was proposed as a cooperative alternative arrangement, more concerned with [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signals]] and data required ''for advanced thinking''—(whereas the traditional ''[A]-system'' of action-potentials and synapses would perhaps cope more with activities such as logistics, muscle-control, and [[pattern-recognition]] which can probably manage using ''analogue'' devices—a division of labour).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/729/7/FulltextThesis.pdf|title=Traill, R.R.

Whether or not one accepts those actual details, such a ''molecule-based'' system offers (i) an obvious scope for clear-cut encoding, (ii) an obvious explanation for any inherited behaviour-traits, (iii) a vastly greater number of candidate-codes from which to select-or-waste in a Darwinian contest; etc. Hence, this might be seen as overcoming Crick's objections, at least partially.

The '''New Family Structures Study''' (abbreviated '''NFSS''') is an epidemiological study of [[LGBT parenting|LGB parenting]] conducted by sociologist [[Mark Regnerus]] of the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. The study surveyed over 15,000 adults between the ages of 18 and 39.&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt; The first research article based on data from the study was published in July 2012 in ''[[Social Science Research]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Regnerus|first1=Mark|title=How different are the adult children of parents who have same-sex relationships? Findings from the New Family Structures Study|journal=Social Science Research|volume=41|issue=4|pages=752–770|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2012.03.009|pmid=23017845|year=2012|url=https://www.ionainstitute.eu/pdfs/1-s2.0-S0049089X12000610-main.pdf|ref=harv|postscript=.|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103215102/https://www.ionainstitute.eu/pdfs/1-s2.0-S0049089X12000610-main.pdf|archivedate=2014-01-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded that children raised by parents in same-gender relationships were at a greater risk of several adverse outcomes, including "being on public assistance, being unemployed, and having poorer educational attainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perrin|first1=E. C.|last2=Siegel|first2=B. S.|title=Promoting the Well-Being of Children Whose Parents Are Gay or Lesbian|journal=Pediatrics|date=20 March 2013|volume=131|issue=4|pages=e1374–e1383|doi=10.1542/peds.2013-0377|pmid=23519940|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/131/4/e1374.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regnerus claimed his study was methodologically superior to previous research on the topic because it used a larger and more random sample.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/kids-of-gay-parents-fare-worse-study-finds-but-draws-fire-from-experts/ | title=Kids of gay parents fare worse, study finds, but research draws fire from experts | work=CBS News | date=12 June 2012 | accessdate=21 October 2014 | author=Jaslow, Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the study was met with considerable criticism from many academics&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt;&lt;ref name=letter/&gt; and scholarly organizations.&lt;ref name=brief/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-becker/supreme-court-american-sociological-association-gay-parents_b_2783523.html | title=In Supreme Court Brief, American Sociological Association Obliterates Claim That Same-Sex Couples Are Inferior Parents | work=Huffington Post | date=28 February 2013 | accessdate=21 October 2014 | author=Becker, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
The NFSS surveyed over 15,000 adults between the ages of 18 and 39&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt; and was conducted by [[Knowledge Networks]] on behalf of the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;ref name=knowledge&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prc.utexas.edu/nfss/documents/NFSS-study-design.pdf | title=New Family Structure Survey | publisher=University of Texas at Austin | work=Knowledge Networks | accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its stated purpose was to determine differences in outcomes among young adults raised by same-sex parents compared to young adults raised by "their married biological parents, those raised with a step-parent, and those raised in homes with two adoptive parents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prc.utexas.edu/nfss/ | title=New Family Structures Study | publisher=University of Texas at Austin | work=Population Research Center | accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey collected data from young adults who had grown up in one of five unconventional families, namely, those where their parents are of the same sex, biologically unrelated parents adopted the respondent, parents were unmarried but co-habiting, biological mother had a romantic relationship with another man, and biological mother did not have a romantic relationship with another man. The survey also collected data from young adults from conventional families as a control group.&lt;ref name=knowledge/&gt;

==Funding==
The study was funded by the [[Witherspoon Institute]], which spent about $700,000 on it, and by the [[Bradley Foundation]], which invested $90,000 in it.&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; The Witherspoon Institute's president expected results that would be unfavorable to those supporting gay marriage.&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2013/03/11/conservative_group_tries_to_sway_scotus_on_gay_marriage_with_flawed_study_partner/ | title=Conservative group tries to sway SCOTUS on gay marriage with flawed study | work=Salon | date=11 March 2013 | accessdate=21 October 2014 | author=Resnick, Sofia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the initial report, Regnerus stated that the Witherspoon Institute and the Bradley Foundation played no role in the design of the study, and dismissed accusations that these organizations had improperly influenced him. In 2013, however, in response to requests by the [[American Independent News Network]], emails sent between Regnerus and Witherspoon Institute employee Brad Wilcox were released which cast doubt on these statements. In one email, Wilcox approved several items relating to the study on behalf of the Witherspoon Institute. Critics have also noted that Wilcox was on the editorial board of ''Social Science Research'', the journal in which the study was later published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2013-03-29/new-documents-contradict-regnerus-claims-on-gay-parenting-study/ | title=New Documents Contradict Regnerus' Claims on Gay Parenting Study | work=Austin Chronicle | date=29 March 2013 | accessdate=5 November 2014 | author=Watson, Brandon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Cynthia Osborne, who is on the UT-Austin faculty along with Regnerus, argued the study was unable to show "whether same-sex parenting causes the observed differences."&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt; She also said that "Children of lesbian mothers might have lived in many different family structures, and it is impossible to isolate the effects of living with a lesbian mother from experiencing divorce, remarriage or living with a single parent."&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt; Similarly, Gary Gates of the [[Williams Institute]] argued that the study's comparison of children of lesbian mothers was a less fair comparison than, for instance, comparing "children of heterosexual or same-sex couples who were raised in similar homes".&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt;

Several writers criticized Regnerus' study for classifying children as being raised by gay parents merely if one of their parents ''ever'' had a same-sex relationship until the child turned 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/a-faulty-gay-parenting-study | title=A Faulty "Gay Parenting" Study | work=New Yorker | date=12 June 2012 | accessdate=21 October 2014 | author=Davidson, Amy|authorlink=Amy Davidson (author)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/06/study-gay-parenting-mark-regnerus | title=Why Conservatives' Favorite New Study on Gay Parenting Won't Matter | work=Mother Jones | date=14 June 2012 | accessdate=10 November 2014 | author=Serwer, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Regnerus himself acknowledged that other factors might explain the differences observed in his study, including "...a lack of social support for parents, stress exposure resulting from persistent stigma, and modest or absent legal security for their parental and romantic relationship statuses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-03/opinion/ct-oped-0803-zorn-20120803_1_gay-parents-gay-marriage-gay-families | title=Same-sex marriage validation from an unlikely source | work=Chicago Tribune | date=3 August 2012 | accessdate=21 October 2014 | author=Zorn, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the July 2015 issue of ''Social Science Research'', Cheng and Powell reanalyzed the data from Regnerus' study and found numerous potential measurement errors, and concluded that Regnerus' conclusions were due to these errors "and other methodological choices".&lt;ref name=reassess&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X1500085X | title=Measurement, methods, and divergent patterns: Reassessing the effects of same-sex parents | accessdate=28 August 2015 | doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2015.04.005 | volume=52 | journal=Social Science Research | pages=615–626}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/05/biggest-anti-gay-marriage-study-was-debunked.html | title=How Scientists Debunked the Biggest Anti-Gay-Marriage Study | work=New York Magazine | date=19 May 2015 | accessdate=21 August 2015 | author=Singal, Jesse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of scientific misconduct===
Soon after the paper was published, blogger Scott Rose accused Regnerus of scientific misconduct for two reasons: deviating from ethical standards and possible falsification of his research. An inquiry was later conducted by the University of Texas-Austin which found that no investigation into these charges was warranted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/09/03/u-texas-backs-professor-in-battle-with-gay-blogger/ | title=U. of Texas backs professor in battle with gay blogger | work=Fox News | date=3 September 2012 | accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Texas-Austin, Randy Diehl asked University of Texas sociologist and associate dean Marc Musick to review the controversy around the NFSS article as part of Regnerus' seventh-year post-tenure  evaluation. Musick sympathetically summarized many of the prior criticisms, going on to allege that the survey itself was designed to ensure the conflation of family structure and the parents' same-sex orientation, practically guaranteeing negative results. Musick claimed that non-disclosure of this design flaw in the original article possibly violated University research ethics standards.&lt;ref&gt;Marc A. Musick, "[https://www.scribd.com/doc/260747196/Musick-s-report#scribd&amp;#x20;review A Review of Methodological and Ethical Issues Surrounding the New Family Structures Study]" (2014): 16-17, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Regnerus claimed the opposite, that the observed instability was due to social realities, not study design.

===Peer review process===
In July 2012, over 150 scientists wrote a letter to the editor of ''Social Science Research'' criticizing the study and raising concerns about the journal's peer review process.&lt;ref name=letter&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.impactprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Letter-to-the-editors-and-advisory-editors-of-Social-Science-Research.pdf | title=Letter to the editors and advisory editors of Social Science Research | date=July 2012 | accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the November 2012 issue of the journal, an audit was published by [[Darren Sherkat]] of [[Southern Illinois University]] regarding the peer-review process with respect to the Regnerus study (as well as another study from the same issue). The audit concluded that the peer-review process failed in these instances because of “both ideology and inattention” by the reviewers; he added that of the six reviewers, three of them were on record as opposing same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sherkat|first1=Darren E.|title=The Editorial Process and Politicized Scholarship: Monday Morning Editorial Quarterbacking and a Call for Scientific Vigilance|journal=Social Science Research|volume=41|issue=6|pages=1346–1349|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2012.08.007|pmid=23017955|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherkat also dismissed the study as "bullshit" in an interview and argued that its definition of gay fathers and lesbian mothers should have “disqualified it immediately” from being considered for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/percolator/controversial-gay-parenting-study-is-severely-flawed-journals-audit-finds/30255 | title=Controversial Gay-Parenting Study Is Severely Flawed, Journal’s Audit Finds | work=Chronicle of Higher Education | date=26 July 2012 | accessdate=21 October 2014 | author=Bartlett, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, journalist John Becker sued the [[University of Central Florida]], where [[James D. Wright]], editor-in-chief of ''Social Science Research'', worked. The suit alleged that the school has violated state law by failing to provide documents pertaining to the study's publication. Becker and others expressed suspicion on the fact that Regnerus' study had taken only six weeks to be published after it was first submitted, while other papers in the same issue took an entire year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2013/04/20/journalist_files_suit_against_university_of_central_florida_seeks_access_to_records_on_flawed_anti_gay_study_partner/ | title=Controversial gay marriage study provokes lawsuit | work=Salon | date=20 April 2013 | accessdate=21 October 2014 | author=Resnick, Sofia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In August 2013, sociologist [[Philip N. Cohen]] wrote on his blog that Wright relied on paid consultants to review the paper and failed to disclose this when the study was first published. He also called for the paper to be retracted and for Wright to step down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2013/08/02/controversy-continues-over-gay-parenting-study | title=Controversy Continues Over Gay Parenting Study | work=Inside Higher Education | date=2 August 2013 | accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amicus brief filed by major medical organizations===
In the 2012 California case ''[[Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management]]'', several major medical organizations, including the [[American Psychological Association]], filed an [[amicus brief]] in which they harshly criticized Regnerus' research. The brief argued that "the Regnerus study sheds no light on the parenting of stable, committed same-sex couples – as Regnerus himself acknowledges..."&lt;ref name=brief&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2012/07/10/12-15388_Amicus_Brief_Psychological.pdf | title=Amicus Brief in Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management | accessdate=21 October 2014 | pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Details on the reassessment of the original research===
In the study Simon Cheng and Brian Powell published on the July 2015 issue of ''Social Science Research'' a large number of potential measurement errors and other methodological choices were identified, which led to erroneous results. According to the authors, which discuss in details how even small differences in coding can profoundly shape empirical patterns, after repeating the analysis with sound methods, the "[d]ifferences in being raised by gay/lesbian and heterosexual parents are minimal."&lt;ref name=reassess /&gt;

==Defense==
Regnerus' study was defended by 18 social scientists in a letter written on the website of the Institute for Studies of Religion at [[Baylor University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2012/july/social-scientists-defend-mark-regnerus-controversial-study.html?paging=off | title=Social Scientists Defend Mark Regnerus' Controversial Study on Same-Sex Parenting | work=Christianity Today | date=10 July 2012 | accessdate=21 October 2014 | author=Weber, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regnerus' former mentor [[Christian Smith (sociologist)|Christian Smith]]&lt;ref name="chronicle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/An-Academic-Auto-da-F-/133107/|title=An Academic Auto-da-Fé|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; has described the public and academic reaction to the ''New Family Structures Study'' as a "witch hunt"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/309945/gay-parenting-witch-hunt-robert-verbruggen|title=The Gay-Parenting Witch Hunt |author=Robert VerBruggen  |work=National Review Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said that the "push-back" to Regnerus' article "is coming simply because some people don’t like where the data led."&lt;ref name="chronicle.com"/&gt; This backlash, Smith argues in his book ''[[The Sacred Project of American Sociology]]'', is a result of the content of sociology's "sacred project" (of mitigating oppression, inequality, etc.); Smith holds that the critical reaction, e.g. on methodological issues, displays a set of double standards insofar as work by other scholars could be (but is generally not) subjected to similar criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Christian. The Sacred Project of American Sociology. Oxford University Press, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citations in court cases==
The New Family Structures Study was cited in amicus briefs the [[United States Supreme Court]] cases of ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' and ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]''.&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; It was also cited by a Hawaiian judge in ''[[Jackson v. Abercrombie]]''.&lt;ref name=salon/&gt;

'''''Ny Teknik''''' (meaning ''New Technology'' in English) is a weekly Swedish magazine with news, debates and ads in the field of technology and engineering. It is published in Stockholm, Sweden.

==History and profile==
''Ny Teknik'' was launched on 18 October 1967.&lt;ref name=nt/&gt; Its former publisher was Ekonomi och Teknik Förlag AB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SanomaWSOY negotiating to buy Sweden's Ekonomi och Teknik Förlag AB|url=http://sanoma.com/en/news/sanomawsoy-negotiating-buy-swedens-ekonomi-och-teknik-forlag-ab|accessdate=5 April 2015|work=SanomaWSOY Group|date=4 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine is headquartered in Stockholm&lt;ref name=svey&gt;{{cite web|title=Ny Teknik|url=http://sverigestidskrifter.se/tidskrifter/251-ny-teknik|work=Sveriges Tidskrifter|accessdate=2 May 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is published by Talentum Sweden.&lt;ref name=bar/&gt;&lt;ref name=fip/&gt;

'''Postgraduate research''' represents a formal area of study that is recognized by a university or institute of higher learning. By definition, the notion of “postgraduate” ([[United States]]) carries the implication that the candidate undertaking such research has already completed a formal [[Master's degree]] and at some instances the [[Doctor of Philosophy |PhD]], at an accredited university or tertiary institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniguru.co.in/studyabroad/postgraduate/us-usa/all-university-courses/harvard-university-courses/72040/1/programs.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting qualifications arising from postgraduate research leads to Post ([[Doctorate]]s).&lt;ref&gt;http://cambridge.net/us/harvard-academics-courses-research/&lt;/ref&gt;
  
==Structure==
The structure of postgraduate research programs can vary significantly from one country to another.  To enter into a PhD program in the United States, students generally must have some form of prerequisite study beyond their basic graduate qualification. This may be a Master’s coursework program, which acts as a qualifier for entry.  In other countries, entry to Doctoral or Master’s research programs is based on the academic track record of the candidates in their undergraduate degrees.

Many students confuse the notion of postgraduate research with “invention” and “discovery”.  Postgraduate research ultimately represents an apprenticeship in the field of research.  In his textbook,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doctortee.net/KeyFactors.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''Key Factors in Postgraduate Research – A Guide for Students''. Dario Toncich explains that the objective of postgraduate research is not necessarily to make a breakthrough invention or, indeed, a major scientific discovery.  

It is, rather, a mechanism by which graduate students learn how to undertake a systematic investigation, founded upon the work built by peers in the field, and then to extend the current state of knowledge.  In the context of assessing a postgraduate research program, it is generally the systematic process of research and investigation that is given more attention than the level to which knowledge is extended.  The title "doctor" emanates from the Latin word ''docera''&amp;mdash;to teach.  Hence there is an expectation that the recipient of a doctorate would go on to become some form of "teacher" in the broad sense of the word.&lt;ref&gt;http://icmr.nic.in/ifc_research.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 19th century, postgraduate research was a rarity, with countries such as the United States only having a small number of candidates across their university spectrum.  However, by the start of the 21st century, postgraduate research, and postgraduate qualifications, had become commonplace.  In any one year, at a global level, there are hundreds of thousands of candidates undertaking postgraduate research programs.  For this reason the nature of postgraduate research has also changed.  

At Doctoral level, there is some recognition that it is no longer reasonable to expect major research breakthroughs as part of a postgraduate research program.  To this end, Doctoral research more commonly now represents an extension of knowledge, rather than some form of breakthrough.  There is also some recognition that modern postgraduate research programs now have to be conducted in the light of massive amounts of previously published work, and hence the [[literature review]] process has become significantly more complex.

The nomenclature associated with titles arising from postgraduate research vary from one institution to another and one country to another. Postgraduate research programs generally result in a thesis/dissertation, which is assessed by independent experts in the field.  The specific nature of the thesis varies from one discipline to another and from one country to another.  In addition, some universities insist that students also undertake a ''viva-voce'' oral examination in which they can defend their research and processes before an expert panel.

In [[India]], generally, the higher the level of the research degree the less association it has with a specific discipline.  For example, at Bachelor's level, it would be common to receive a [[Bachelor of Science |BS]]c(Chemistry).  At Master's level, the corresponding degree would be an MSc (without the specific subdiscipline).  At Doctoral level, the degree would be simply PhD with no discipline stated.  This is intended to show that the recipient of the award has mastered techniques that are more generic than those encapsulated in a specific discipline or subdiscipline.  There are some exceptions to this.  In a professional Doctorate, where the objective is to demonstrate an in-depth research knowledge of a particular area, the discipline is usually included (e.g., Doctor of Business).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isb.edu/fpm/ProgrammeStructure.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In some universities, it is also possible for candidates to achieve what is referred to as a "higher doctorate".  This is generally an award bestowed upon people who have made a substantial contribution to their discipline through their research.  Higher doctorates would normally be awarded after a significant research career and therefore those who receive such awards generally already have a basic PhD to begin with.  Like professional doctorates, higher doctorates generally carry the title of the discipline to which the research contributions have been made&amp;mdash;for example, Doctor of Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.be.seas.upenn.edu/prospective-students/doctoral/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Qadan culture''' (13,000-9,000 BC) was an [[archaeological culture|ancient culture]] that, [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence suggests, originated in [[Upper Egypt]] (present day south [[Egypt]]) approximately 15,000 years ago &lt;ref name="Phillipson"&gt;Phillipson, DW: ''African Archaeology'' page 149. Cambridge University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;Shaw, I &amp; Jameson, R: ''A Dictionary of Archaeology'', page 136. Blackwell Publishers Ltd, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;. This way of life is estimated to have persisted for approximately 4,000 years, and was characterized by [[hunting]], as well as a unique approach to food gathering that incorporated the preparation and consumption of wild grasses and [[Cereal|grains]].&lt;ref name="Phillipson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw" /&gt; Systematic efforts were made by the Qadan people to water, care for, and harvest local plant life, but grains were not planted in ordered rows. &lt;ref name="Darvill" /&gt;

Sites from this period span from the [[Cataracts of the Nile|Second Cataract of the Nile]] to Tushka, situated approximately 250 kilometers upriver from Aswan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East|last = Facts On File, Incorporated|first = |publisher = Infobase Publishing|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = 777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In archaeological terms, the Qadan culture is generally viewed as a cluster of Mesolithic Stage communities living in [[Nubia]] in the upper [[Nile Valley]] prior to 9000 BC. At a time of relatively high water levels in the Nile, it is characterized by a diverse stone tool industry that is taken to represent increasing degrees of specialization and locally differentiated regional groupings.&lt;ref name="Darvill"&gt;Darvill, T: ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology'', Copyright © 2002, 2003 by Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Large numbers of [[grinding stone]]s and blades have been found with glossy films of [[silica]] on them, which could possibly be the result of cutting grass stems on their surfaces. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/ebph3.htm |title=Egypt: History - The Upper Paleolithic |date=June 20, 2011 |accessdate=June 12, 2014 |website=Tour Egypt |publisher=Tour Egypt |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112142044/http://www.touregypt.net/ebph3.htm |archivedate=January 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence of conflict between the groups, suggesting periods of invasion or intense inter-tribal war.&lt;ref name="Darvill" /&gt;  In fact, about 40 percent of individuals buried in the [[Jebel Sahaba]] cemetery near the border of [[Sudan]] on the Nile river show signs of fatal wounds caused by projectiles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East|last = Facts On File, Incorporated|first = |publisher = Infobase Publishing|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = 777}}&lt;/ref&gt; from weapons such as spears, darts, or arrows.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The remains found in the cemeteries suggest that ritual burials were practiced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The Qadan economy was based on fishing, hunting, and, as mentioned, the extensive use of wild grain.&lt;ref name="Darvill" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1494">In the [[biological sciences]], a '''replicate''' is an exact copy of a sample that is being analyzed, such as a cell, organism or molecule, on which exactly the same procedure is done. This is often done in order to check for [[experimental error|experimental]] or procedural error. In the absence of error replicates should yield the same result. However, replicates are not independent tests of the hypothesis because they are still the same sample, and so do not test for variation between samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Vaux, D.|author2=Fidler, F.|author3=Cumming, G.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Replicates and repeats—what is the difference and is it significant?|journal=EMBO Rep|volume=13|issue=4|pages=291–296|year=2012|pmc=3321166|doi=10.1038/embor.2012.36|pmid=22421999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Replicate|title=Replicate - Biology-Online Dictionary|work=biology-online.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replicates are often created to test the quality and repeatability of a procedure, or for a destructive procedure where preserving the original sample is desirable. They are also sometimes inappropriately used to inflate the apparent number of observations in a sample, creating an illusion of [[statistical significance]].

It runs a high resolution model in order to try to determine the extent to which [[extreme weather]] events are attributable to human-induced [[global warming]].

The project did cease giving out more work, however there has been a project extension to try a fourth sea surface temperature pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seasonal.cpdn.org/extension.php SAP Extension] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205053648/http://seasonal.cpdn.org/extension.php |date=2007-02-05 }} - Seasonal Attribution Project&lt;/ref&gt; Current work will still be accepted and used for collaborations and possibly revisions of papers during the review process.

'''Seeding''' a material is a concept used in [[fluid dynamics]] to describe the act of introducing specific [[particulate]]s or other foreign substances into a stream of [[fluid]] being evaluated. An altered fluid will be described as having a '''seeded''' flow.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;

==Details==
{{expand-section|date=September 2015}}
These particulates are generally small enough to be carried by the fluid but large enough to be picked up using a [[flow visualization]] technique, such as [[particle image velocimetry]] (PIV).  In reference to [[aerodynamic]] testing, such as [[wind tunnel]] testing, water tunnel testing, or any other test investigating the flow of a fluid which may be invisible to the naked eye, seeding a flow is often the only way to take visual measurements.  Simple examples of a seeded flow include the introduction of smoke into a low speed wind tunnel to see the general path of the air, or injecting colored dye into a water tunnel to see secondary flow structures such as hairpin vortices.{{fact|date=September 2015}}

As stated in ''The Handbook of Fluid Dynamics'', an ideal seeding particle should have uniform properties such that its density is the same as the fluid that it's added to.&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;{{citebook|title=The Handbook of Fluid Dynamics|first=Richard W.|last=Johnson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBTlucgGdegC&amp;pg=SA35-PA9&amp;dq=%22seeding+the+flow%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBWoVChMIn8vGn8PwxwIVzBSSCh0uEA_A#v=onepage&amp;q=%22seeding%20the%20flow%22&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|date=1998|ISBN=9783540646129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shanghai Project''' is a multidisciplinary ideas platform bringing together practitioners from a variety of disciplines, including art, architecture, design, film, performance, sound, as well as the humanities, social and natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.shanghai-project.org/about/|website=Shanghai Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural edition of the Shanghai Project, under the co-artistic directorship of [[Yongwoo Lee]], Executive Director of Shanghai Himalayas Museum, and [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]], Artistic Director of [[Serpentine Galleries]] London, is organized by the [[Shanghai Himalayas Museum]], and co-organized by the Shanghai International Culture Association, and supported by [[Envision Energy]] and Zendai Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A bridge to culture — before the deluge|url=https://www.ft.com/content/428e8b0e-f121-11e5-9f20-c3a047354386|publisher=''[[Financial Times]]''|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Shanghai Project was founded in 2015 by Yongwoo Lee in partnership with Dai Zhikang. The first phase of Shanghai Project took place in 2016 at the Himalaya Center and [[Shanghai Himalayas Museum]], its satellite venue at Zendai Zhujiajiao Art Museum, and various venues across Shanghai including Century Park (Shanghai)|Century Park in Pudong New District.

* 2016: Inaugural edition of Shanghai Project, Envision 2116, Co-Artistic Directors: [[Yongwoo Lee]] and [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]].

==First edition of Shanghai Project (2016)==
The inaugural edition of the Shanghai Project will launch on September 4, 2016 and take place over the duration of eleven months, ending in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shanghai Project: City’s Newest Art Festival Envisions the Future in 2116|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1473245/shanghai-project-citys-newest-art-festival-envisions-the|website=BLOUART INFO|publisher=[[Louise Blouin Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking “Envision 2116” as its theme, the festival gathering—from China and abroad—"artists, filmmakers, performers, musicians, designers, architects, writers (including journalists, bloggers, science fiction novelists, and poets), philosophers, historians, scientists, economists, geographers, sociologists, anthropologists, doctors, lawyers, engineers, hackers, and activists, all of whom will be dubbed 'researchers'",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/hans-ulrich-obrist-yongwoo-lee-helm-first-edition-mysterious-shanghai-project-460199|title=Hans Ulrich Obrist to Helm First Edition of Mysterious Shanghai Project|last=|first=|date=March 28, 2016|website=[[Artnet]]|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the people of Shanghai to think, discuss, relate, and act on the sustainability of the humankind's futures in the 22nd century".

Phase one of the first edition includes exhibitions, gatherings, screenings, talks, workshops, an open call, a commissioned architectural pavilion, and public art installations across sites in Shanghai, as well as the annual International Biennial Association Conference in collaboration with the [[Power Station of Art]] from September 3–4, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Project uses art, hands-on activities to ponder big questions|publisher=Shanghai Daily|date=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers of this phase included: [[Xu Bing]],&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/on-spectacle-and-sustainability-at-the-shanghai-project-738206&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jenova Chen]], [[Otobong Nkanga]], [[Douglas Coupland]], [[Liam Gillick]], Liu Yi, [[Sou Fujimoto]], and [[Cildo Meireles]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Researchers|url=http://www.shanghai-project.org/researchers/|website=Shanghai Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shanghai Project Pavilion===
The Shanghai Project invited Japanese architect [[Sou Fujimoto]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shanghai Project to explore future of sustainable development|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/shanghai/lujiazui/2016-07/28/content_26258559.htm|agency=China Daily|date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to design and construct a pavilion, titled "Envision Pavilion" and situated besides the [[Arata Isozaki]]-designed Shanghai Himalayas Center, to house various cultural activities and amenities.

===Exhibitions program===
The Shanghai Project's exhibitions program creates multiple narratives in response to the theme of "Envision 2116", through an open and flexible configuration of multi-media installations, taking place at different venues across Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Project uses art, hands-on activities to ponder big questions|publisher=Shanghai Daily|date=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shanghai Project Public Program===
The Shanghai Project’s public program includes a wide range of public activities, including performances, film and video screenings, discursive programs and participatory events. Notable ones include “Community Participation Program,” a series of neighborhood events intended to open a dialogue between the city of Shanghai and its residents that launched on July 15, 2016, joint programs with Jifeng Bookstore and Shanghai Flaneur, as well as a children’s program located in Century Park.

===Qidian, Shanghai Project Open Call===
“Qidian,” which loosely translates into “starting point”, is an nationwide open call designed to tap into the talent and interests of China’s new generation, which is based on the long-term international project “89plus” (co-curated by Simon Castets and Hans Ulrich Obrist in collaboration with Katherine Dionysius).

'''Society for Science &amp; the Public''' ('''SSP'''), formerly known as '''Science Service''', is a [[501(c)3]] [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to the promotion of science, through its [[science education]] programs and [[science communication|publications]], including the bi-weekly ''[[Science News]]'' magazine and the free-accessible online ''Science News for Students''.

The organization has headquarters  in [[Washington, D.C.]] It promotes the understanding and appreciation of science and the role it plays in human advancement.&lt;ref name="SSP-History"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.societyforscience.org/mission-and-history |title=Mission&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; History |publisher=Society for Science&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; the Public. societyforscience.org |date= |accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In pursuit of this goal, it  publishes ''[[Science News]]'' and ''[[Science News for Students]]'', and sponsors events including the [[Intel International Science and Engineering Fair]], the [[Regeneron Science Talent Search]], and the [[Broadcom MASTERS]] (Math, Applied Science, Technology and Engineering for Rising Stars) competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.societyforscience.org/masters The Broadcom MASTERS], Society for Science and the Public.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
SSP was founded in 1921 by journalist [[Edward W. Scripps]] and zoologist [[William Emerson Ritter]], under the name "Science Service",  with the goal of informing the public of the latest scientific discoveries and achievements.&lt;ref name="Tobey"&gt;Tobey, Ronald C. (1971). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QTpaQgQVj9AC&amp;pg=PA66 The American Ideology of National Science, 1919-1930]''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press. {{ISBN|9780822975946}}. pp.&amp;nbsp;66-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSP-History"/&gt;  The Science Service emerged from a reorganization of a group that Scripps and Ritter had originally founded in 1919 as the American Society for the Dissemination of Science.&lt;ref name="Tobey"/&gt;

Scripps and Ritter accomplished their goal by distributing the latest science research to the public through a news service for reporters. In 1922, due to interest from non-journalists, Science Service started distributing ''[[Science News-Letter]]'', which became a magazine in 1926. It quickly grew into a prime source of science news for libraries, schools, and individuals. In 1942, Science Service launched the first of its prestigious education competitions, the [[Westinghouse Science Talent Search]].

In 2008, Science Service became Society for Science &amp; the Public (SSP) in order to better reflect the mission of the organization to advocate for science in the public interest.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Between the World Wars, Science Service sponsored [[Science Clubs of America]], founded by [[Watson Davis]], a national organization to popularize science among amateur scientists. High school science clubs were encouraged to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=News and Views: Science Clubs of America|journal=Nature|date=15 November 1941|volume=148|issue=3759|page=590|doi=10.1038/148590a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1940 through 1989, Science Service sponsored the [[Things of Science]] Club. Subscribers received a monthly box containing some kind or material or artifact along with an pamphlet describing experiments that could be done with it. Sometimes the kits contained parts which could be assembled into a scientific instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1hwiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QKQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4985,4298460&amp;dq=things-of-science&amp;hl=en|title=Thing-of-the-Month Club will provide remarkable objects|last=Othman|first=Frederick C.|date=October 7, 1947|work=San Jose Evening News|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2003, it published ''Science News for Kids'',  an online magazine aimed at students, and also at  teachers and parents

==Reception==
Writer [[Alex Bellos]] described ''The Mathematics of Life'' as "a testament to the versatility of maths and how it is shaping our understanding of the world."&lt;ref name=Bellos&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bellos|first1=Alex|author-link=Alex Bellos|title=Mathematics of Life by Ian Stewart - Review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/16/mathematics-of-life-ian-stewart-review|accessdate=4 May 2015|work=The Guardian|date=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called the book "an ingenious overview of biology with emphasis on mathematical ideas—stimulating but requiring careful reading despite the lack of equations."&lt;ref name="kirkus"/&gt; A review in ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'' noted that the book "does an admirable job of unfolding the mathematics undergirding so much of the research being carried out today in the many fields that comprise the subject of biology."&lt;ref name=adam&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adam|first1=John|title=Putting the "X" in Biology: A Review of The Mathematics of Life|journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society|date=December 2011|volume=58|issue=11|pages=1572–1578|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201111/rtx111101572p.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematician and science writer [[Keith Devlin]] criticized the book, writing that "readers of the author's many general-audience books on mathematics may be surprised to find themselves at times frustrated by his latest outing, which is marred by overlapping and often repetitious passages."&lt;ref name=devlin&gt;{{cite news|last1=Devlin|first1=Keith|authorlink1=Keith Devlin|title=New Angles on Biology: Life sciences, meet mathematics: How viruses resemble Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome, and other discoveries|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304066504576345382084988252|accessdate=4 May 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critical response to the book was positive. [[Jane Brody|Jane E. Brody]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', called it "a fast-moving, informative and thoroughly enjoyable chronicle, with amusing anecdotes, legends and interesting sidelights that reflect the personalities, lives and times of the men who shaped our nation scientifically." She noted that "the authors have kept their writing free of chauvinism," and that "[m]ost of the scientific concepts are well enough explained so that even the newcomer to science should be able to grasp at least the essence of them."&lt;ref&gt;"Science For Teen-Agers," ''New York Times'', November 5, 1967, p. BR216.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same issue the book was included among seventy-five recommended titles selected by the Children's Editor of the newspaper's Book Review, described as an "[i]nformative, thoroughly enjoyable chronicle of the development of science in our country."&lt;ref&gt;"Seventy-Five Recommended Titles," ''New York Times'', November 5, 1967, p. BR233.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Publishers Weekly|Publishers' Weekly]]'' stated that "[t]o read the index ... is to read the names of the men and of their discoveries in science in America, from the earliest days ... to the space age. To read the book is to become familiar with the men and their contributions to science."&lt;ref&gt;"Other Science Topics," ''Publishers' Weekly'', November 13, 1967, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

George Basalia, writing for ''[[Library Journal]]'', called the book "a first-rate history of American science and technology for high-school students ... cover[ing] major American technical discoveries as well as our contributions to the purely theoretical aspects of science." He found "much to be praised ... the book is intelligently conceived, carefully organized, clearly written, and handsomely designed. Unfortunately, the illustrations do not do justice to [the] excellent text."&lt;ref&gt;"De CAMP, L. Sprague &amp; Catherine C. De Camp. ''The Story of Science in America''," ''Library Journal'', December 15, 1967, p. 4620.&lt;/ref&gt;

H. D. Allen in the ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'' wrote that the book's story "makes fascinating reading," and that "[w]hile the treatment of any one discipline may at first seem superficial and chatty, the total impact is most impressive, for the reader is left with an acquaintance with the leading figures of the age of science and some appreciation of how the contribution of each influenced a way of life." He concluded "The breadth of scientific knowledge which this book represents is remarkable, as is the skill with which it has been set down and the effortlessness with which it reads."&lt;ref&gt;"Books: Roster Of Science," ''Montreal Gazette'', January 27, 1968, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Booklist|The Booklist]]'' called it "[a] wide-ranging survey [that] reflects the authors' humanistic interests as well as their familiarity with several branches of science and their extensive background reading."&lt;ref&gt;"Books for young adults," ''The Booklist'', February 15, 1968, p. 680.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hal Clement|Harry C. Stubbs]] in ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'' included it among "half a dozen books dealing ... with the history of science [that] I can recommend [both] to nonscientists as guides toward the Light [and] to scientists and science teachers as reminders that what we know was long, slow, and hard in coming." He noted that it "give[s] us a series of fascinating biographical and anecdotal items strung loosely on the thread of developing scientific knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;"Views on Science Books," ''The Horn Book Magazine'', February 1968, pp. 81-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Morrison|Philip]] and Phylis Morrison in ''[[Scientific American]]'' felt it "manages to convey a sense of coherence, even though it deals at staccato length with so many men, trends and ideas ... The reason is partly in the expert writing--smooth, unusually candid, cheerful and sometimes a bit condescending (as in the two or three pages about Veblen)." They add that "[n]ot all the dicta of the authors seem reasonable, but to find any personal judgment at work is so rare in this kind of pedagogy that one is pleased by the De Camps even when one disagrees with them."&lt;ref&gt;"A Christmas selection of books on science for younger readers," ''Scientific American'', December 1968, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theory of the Earth''''' was a publication by [[James Hutton]] which laid the foundations for [[geology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/theory-of-the-earth/#|title=Theory of The Earth|author=Scientific American|accessdate=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mather, Kirtley &amp; Mason, Shirley L. (eds) [1939] 1967. ''A source book in Geology, 1400–1900''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 92{{ndash}}100. {{ISBN|0-674-82277-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he showed that the Earth is the product of natural forces. What could be seen happening today, over long periods of time, could produce what we see in the rocks. This idea, [[uniformitarianism]], was used by [[Charles Lyell]] in his work, and Lyell's textbook was an important influence on [[Charles Darwin]]. The work was first published in 1788&lt;ref name="Hutton1788"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hutton |first1=James |author-link1=James Hutton |year=1788 |title=Theory of the Earth; or an Investigation of the Laws observable in the Composition, Dissolution, and Restoration of Land upon the Globe |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh |publisher=[[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] |volume=1 |issue=Part 2 |pages=209–304 |url=https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro01roya }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], and later in 1795 as two book volumes.&lt;ref name="Hutton1795v1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hutton |first1=James |year=1795 |title=Theory of the Earth |volume=1 |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutton1795v2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hutton |first1=James |year=1795 |title=Theory of the Earth |volume=2 |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton recognized that rocks record the evidence of the past action of processes which still operate today. He also [[wikt:anticipate|anticipated]] [[natural selection]], as follows:
:"Those which depart most from the best adapted constitution, will be the most liable to perish, while, on the other hand, those organised bodies, which most approach to the best constitution for the present circumstances, will be best adapted to continue, in preserving themselves and multiplying the individuals of their race".&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite journal |title=In retrospect |author=Pearson, Paul N |year=2003 |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/425665a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton's [[prose]] hindered his theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Geikie, Archibald 1897 | title = The founders of geology | page = 166 | publisher = Macmillan| location = London | url = https://books.google.com/?id=xPYLAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=james+hutton+geology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Playfair]] in 1802 restated of Huttton's geological ideas in clearer English. However, he left out Hutton's thoughts on [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Playfair, John 1802. ''Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth''. Edinburgh. Playfair added an important observation of his own: that [[glacier]]s can transport great quantities of rock.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Lyell]] in the 1830s popularised the idea of an infinitely repeating cycle (of the [[erosion]] of rocks and the building up of [[sediment]]). Lyell believed in gradual change, and thought even Hutton gave too much credit to [[catastrophism|catastrophic changes]]. 

Hutton's work was published in different forms and stages:
#1788. Theory of the Earth; or an investigation of the laws observable in the composition, dissolution, and restoration of land upon the Globe. ''Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'', vol. '''1''', Part 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;209–304.
#1795. ''Theory of the Earth; with proofs and illustrations''. 2 vols, Edinburgh: Creech. 
#1899. ''Theory of the Earth; with proofs and illustrations, vol III''. Edited by Sir Archibald Geikie. Geological Society, Burlington House, London.

[[File:Vacuum World.tif|thumb|Vacuum World, a [[shortest path problem]] in which the goal is to vacuum up all the pieces of dirt]]
In scientific disciplines, a '''toy problem'''&lt;ref name="aima2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="korf2012" /&gt; or a '''puzzlelike problem'''&lt;ref name="pearl1984" /&gt; is a problem that is not of immediate scientific interest, yet is used as an expository device to illustrate a trait that may be shared by other, more complicated, instances of the problem, or as a way to explain a particular, more general, problem solving technique.

For instance, while engineering a large system, the large problem is often broken down into many smaller toy problems which have been well understood in detail. Often these problems distill a few important aspects of complicated problems so that they can be studied in isolation. Toy problems are thus often very useful in providing intuition about specific phenomena in more complicated problems.

As an example, in the field of [[artificial intelligence]], classical puzzles, games and problems are often used as toy problems. These include [[sliding-block puzzle]]s, [[N-Queens problem]], [[missionaries and cannibals problem]], [[tick-tack-toe]], [[chess]],&lt;ref name="aima2010"&gt;{{cite book

'''USA-212'''&lt;ref name="heavens-info" /&gt; was the first flight of the [[Boeing]] [[Boeing X-37|X-37B]] '''Orbital Test Vehicle 1''' ('''X-37B OTV-1'''), an American unmanned robotic [[VTHL|vertical-takeoff, horizontal-landing]] (VTHL) [[spaceplane]].
It was launched aboard an [[Atlas V]] rocket from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] on 22 April 2010, and operated in [[low Earth orbit]]. Its designation is part of the [[List of USA satellites|USA series]].

The spaceplane is operated by the [[United States Air Force]], which has not revealed the specific identity of the spaceship's [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] for the mission.  The Air Force has stated only that the spacecraft would "demonstrate various experiments and allow satellite sensors, subsystems, components, and associated technology to be transported into space and back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2010/0420/Air-Force-to-launch-X-37-space-plane-Precursor-to-war-in-orbit |title=Air Force To Launch X-37 Space Plane: Precursor To War In Orbit? |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |last=Lubold |first=Gordon |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
USA-212 was launched on an Atlas&amp;nbsp;V 501 rocket, tail number AV-012, from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41|Space Launch Complex 41]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/091022-x37b-testlaunch.html |title=Air Force's Secretive Space Plane Nears Maiden Voyage |work=Space.com |last=Leonard |first=David |date=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sfnfeb"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/atlas/av012/100225x37arrival/ |title=Air Force X-37B spaceplane arrives in Florida for launch |work=Spaceflight Now |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=25 February 2010 |accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch, which was conducted by [[United Launch Alliance]], occurred at 23:52 [[UTC]] on 22 April 2010, placing the spacecraft into [[low Earth orbit]] for testing.&lt;ref name="SFN-launch"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/atlas/av012/100422launch/ |title=Atlas rocket delivers Air Force spaceplane to orbit |work=Spaceflight Now |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=22 April 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The X-37B spacecraft was originally intended to be deployed from the payload bay of a NASA [[Space Shuttle]], but following the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' accident]], it was transferred to a [[Delta II|Delta&amp;nbsp;II 7920]]. It was subsequently transferred to the Atlas&amp;nbsp;V following concerns over the X-37B's aerodynamic properties during launch.&lt;ref name="GSP" /&gt;

On 9 April, a 24-hour delay was announced.

On 21 April, the Atlas was rolled back out to the launch pad for launch.&lt;ref name="MSC"/&gt; The launch window on 22 April opened at 23:52 UTC, and closed at 00:01 on 23 April.

==Mission==

Most of the mission parameters for the USA-212 flight have not been disclosed.&lt;ref name="sfnfeb"/&gt;  The vehicle is capable of being on-orbit for up to 270 days.  The Air Force stated the mission time would depend on progress of the craft's experiments during orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/awx_04_22_2010_p0-222025.xml |title=U.S. Air Force X-37B Launched |work=[[Aviation Week]] |first=Irene |last=Klotz |date=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mission control was handled by the [[3d Space Experimentation Squadron]], [[21st Space Wing]], of the [[Air Force Space Command]] in Colorado Springs.&lt;ref name="AFRoundtable20100423"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dodlive.mil/index.php/2010/04/air-force-bloggers-roundtable-air-force-set-to-launch-first-x-37b-orbital-test-vehicle/ |title=Air Force Bloggers Roundtable: Air Force set to launch first X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle |work=DODlive.mil |publisher=U.S. Department of Defense |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observations by amateur skywatchers===
In May 2010, an amateur astronomer claimed to spot the spacecraft from his home in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref name=AU-May24&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/amateur-astronomers-unravel-x37-b-orbit-say-likely-use-for-deploying-spy-satellites/story-e6frfro0-1225870574214 |title=Amateur astronomers unravel X37-B orbit, say likely use for deploying spy satellites |work=News.com.au |date=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the initial observation, several more detailed observations were made by amateur skywatchers from around the world, who reported the spacecraft to have an almost circular {{convert|401|to|422|km|mi|abbr=on}} low Earth orbit with an inclination of 40°.&lt;ref name=Space-May22&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/news/secret-x-37-b-space-plane-spotted-by-amateur-astronomers-100522.html |title=Secret X-37B spaceplane spotted by amateur skywatchers |work=Space.com |first=Leonard |last=David |date=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group believed in their calculations and observations with a high degree of confidence.&lt;ref name=Space-May22/&gt; The spacecraft's [[ground track]] was observed to repeat every four days, which was considered indicative for a possible imaging reconnaissance mission profile.&lt;ref name=Space-May22/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20100522"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/science/space/23secret.html?pagewanted=all |title=Surveillance Is Suspected as Spacecraft's Main Role |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=William J. |last=Broad |authorlink=William Broad |date=21 May 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For two weeks, starting on 29 July, the amateur skywatchers were unable to find the spacecraft in the locations they had predicted, leading them to believe it had suddenly changed its course.&lt;ref name=AU-Aug24&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/us-militarys-top-secret-x-37b-shuttle-disappears-for-two-weeks-changes-orbit/story-e6frfro0-1225909738276 |title=US military's top secret X-37B shuttle 'disappears' for two weeks, changes orbit |work=News.com.au |first=Peter |last=Farquhar |date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the mission, the vehicle was observed to change its orbit multiple times, with a total [[delta-v]] of the first four orbit changes amounting to {{convert|102| m/s|abbr=on}}. A common characteristic of all the orbits was that the [[ground track]] nearly repeated every few days.&lt;ref name="AU-Aug24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seesat_Nov-2010_0287.html"/&gt; By 12 November 2010, the orbit had been lowered to {{convert|281|by|292|km|mi|abbr=on}} with the ground track now repeating every three days (47 orbits).&lt;ref name="seesat_Nov-2010_0287.html"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.satobs.org/seesat/Nov-2010/0287.html|title=Updated X-37B OTV 1-1 elements|work=SatObs.org |first=Ted|last=Molczan|accessdate=25 November 2010|date=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landing==
[[File:OTV1 landing IR 20101203.png|thumb|right|Infrared view of OTV1 after landing]]
After completing its mission, the X-37B was deorbited, [[atmospheric reentry|entered the atmosphere]], and landed at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] on 3 December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1012/03x37landing/ |title=Home again: U.S. military space plane returns to Earth |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Stephen |last=Clark |date=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The X-37B is the second reusable spacecraft to perform an automated landing after returning from orbit, the first being the Soviet [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] spacecraft in 1988.&lt;ref name="rockets_and_people"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20050010181 |title=Rockets and People |volume=1 |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |series=NASA History Series |first=Boris E. |last=Chertok |editor-first=Asif A. |editor-last=Siddiqi |format=PDF |year=2005 |page=179 |id=SP-2005-4110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothetical mission components==
As the mission of USA-212 and the X-37B program are classified, public commentary on the program is speculation. [[James Oberg]] speculated that the concurrent launch of Air Force's Hypersonic Technology Vehicle [[DARPA Falcon Project|HTV-2]] was related to the mission. Part of an X-37B's mission profile might involve a simulated enemy attack, which the X-37B should be able to detect and autonomously counteract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/space-flight/us-air-force-launches-secret-flying-twinkie |title=U.S. Air Force Launches Secret Flying Twinkie: Military's new space plane tests unnamed powers |work=IEEE Spectrum |first=James |last=Oberg |authorlink=James Oberg |date=31 March 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; HTV-2 was launched at 23:00 [[UTC]] on 22 April 2010, i.e., 52 minutes ahead of X-37B, from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1004/23minotaur/index.html |title=New Minotaur rocket launches on suborbital flight |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Stephen |last=Clark |date=23 April 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a suborbital trajectory supposed to last less than 25 min.&lt;ref name="Mach 20"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/hypersonics.html?story=fullstory |title=Mach 20 or Bust |journal=[[Air &amp; Space]] |first=Geoffrey |last=Little |date=1 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission failed and was aborted nine minutes after launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147484133 |title=Falcon HTV-2 Launch Tests Hypersonic Vehicle Flight Capabilities |publisher=[[DARPA]] |format=PDF |first=Johanna |last=Jones |date=23 April 2010 |accessdate=5 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804194505/http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147484133 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147484134 |title=DARPA Concludes Review of Falcon HTV-2 Flight Anomaly |work=[[DARPA]] |format=PDF |date=16 November 2010 |accessdate=5 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804193948/http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147484134 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Scott, coauthor of the techno-novel ''Counterspace: The Next Hours of World War&amp;nbsp;III'' and former Rocky Mountain Bureau Chief for ''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'' magazine believes that with X-37B, the Air Force might test weapon delivery from a space plane in low Earth orbit. He mentions [[Kinetic bombardment|Rods from God]] as a possible scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/8195-air-force-mystery-37b-space-plane-fuels-speculation.html |title=Air Force's Mystery X-37B Space Plane Fuels Speculation |work=Space.com |first=Leonard |last=David |date=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis aligns with speculation that the launch of USA-212 marks the beginning of [[Militarisation of space|military operations in space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/tech/2010/04/23/starr.mystery.plane.cnn |title=Mystery military space plane |work=CNN.com |first=Barbara |last=Starr |type=Video |date=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12631">'''Variance-based sensitivity analysis''' (often referred to as the '''Sobol method''' or '''Sobol indices''', after [[Ilya M. Sobol]]) is a form of global [[sensitivity analysis]].&lt;ref name="Sobol2001"&gt;Sobol,I.M. (2001), Global sensitivity indices for nonlinear mathematical models and their Monte Carlo estimates. ''MATH COMPUT SIMULAT'',55(1–3),271-280, DOI:10.1016/S0378-4754(00)00270-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Primer"&gt;Saltelli, A., Ratto, M., Andres, T., Campolongo, F., Cariboni, J., Gatelli, D. Saisana, M., and Tarantola, S., 2008, ''Global Sensitivity Analysis. The Primer'', John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Working within a [[probability|probabilistic]] framework, it decomposes the [[variance]] of the output of the model or system into fractions which can be attributed to inputs or sets of inputs. For example, given a model with two inputs and one output, one might find that 70% of the output variance is caused by the variance in the first input, 20% by the variance in the second, and 10% due to [[Interaction (statistics)|interactions]] between the two. These percentages are directly interpreted as measures of sensitivity. Variance-based measures of sensitivity are attractive because they measure sensitivity across the whole input space (i.e. it is a global method), they can deal with [[nonlinear]] responses, and they can measure the effect of interactions in non-[[Additive map|additive]] systems.&lt;ref name="OAT"&gt;Saltelli, A., Annoni, P., 2010, How to avoid a perfunctory sensitivity analysis, ''Environmental Modeling and Software'' '''25''', 1508–1517.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decomposition of variance==
From a [[black box]] perspective, any [[mathematical model|model]] may be viewed as a function ''Y''=''f''('''X'''), where '''X''' is a vector of ''d'' uncertain model inputs {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;}, and ''Y'' is a chosen univariate model output (note that this approach examines scalar model outputs, but multiple outputs can be analysed by multiple independent sensitivity analyses). Furthermore, it will be assumed that the inputs are [[Independence (probability theory)|independently]] and [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly]] distributed within the unit hypercube, i.e. &lt;math&gt; X_i \in [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; i=1,2,...,d &lt;/math&gt;. This incurs no loss of generality because any input space can be transformed onto this unit hypercube. ''f''('''X''') may be decomposed in the following way,&lt;ref name="Sob1"&gt;Sobol’, I. (1990). Sensitivity estimates for nonlinear mathematical models. ''Matematicheskoe Modelirovanie'' '''2''', 112–118. in Russian, translated in English in Sobol’ , I. (1993). Sensitivity analysis for non-linear mathematical models. ''Mathematical Modeling &amp; Computational Experiment (Engl. Transl.)'', 1993, '''1''', 407–414.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; Y = f_0 + \sum_{i=1}^d f_i(X_i) + \sum_{i&lt;j}^{d} f_{ij}(X_i,X_j) + \cdots + f_{1,2,\dots,d}(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a constant and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a function of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; a function of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. A condition of this decomposition is that,

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^1 f_{i_1 i_2 \dots i_s}(X_{i_1},X_{i_2},\dots,X_{i_s}) dX_{k}=0, \text{ for } k = i_1,...,i_s &lt;/math&gt;

i.e. all the terms in the functional decomposition are [[orthogonality|orthogonal]]. This leads to definitions of the terms of the functional decomposition in terms of conditional expected values,

:&lt;math&gt; f_0 = E(Y) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; f_i(X_i) = E(Y|X_i) - f_0 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; f_{ij}(X_i,X_j) = E(Y|X_i,X_j) - f_0 - f_i - f_j &lt;/math&gt;

From which it can be seen that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the effect of varying ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; alone (known as the [[main effect]] of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;), and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is the effect of varying ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; simultaneously, ''additional to the effect of their individual variations''. This is known as a second-order [[Interaction (statistics)|interaction]]. Higher-order terms have analogous definitions.

Now, further assuming that the ''f''('''X''') is [[Square-integrable function|square-integrable]], the functional decomposition may be squared and integrated to give,

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^1 f^2(\mathbf{X}) d\mathbf{X} - f_0^2 = \sum_{s=1}^d \sum_{i_1&lt;\dots&lt;i_s}^d \int f_{i_1 \dots i_s}^2 dX_{i_1} \dots dX_{i_s} &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the left hand side is equal to the variance of ''Y'', and the terms of the right hand side are variance terms, now decomposed with respect to sets of the ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. This finally leads to the decomposition of variance expression,

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var}(Y) = \sum_{i=1}^d V_i + \sum_{i&lt;j}^{d} V_{ij} + \cdots + V_{12 \dots d}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; V_{i} = \operatorname{Var}_{X_i} \left( E_{\textbf{X}_{\sim i}} (Y \mid X_{i}) \right) &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; V_{ij} = \operatorname{Var}_{X_{ij}} \left( E_{\textbf{X}_{\sim ij}} \left( Y \mid X_i, X_j\right)\right) - \operatorname{V}_{i} - \operatorname{V}_{j} &lt;/math&gt;

and so on. The ''X''&lt;sub&gt;~''i''&lt;/sub&gt; notation indicates the set of all variables ''except'' ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  The above variance decomposition shows how the variance of the model output can be decomposed into terms attributable to each input, as well as the interaction effects between them. Together, all terms sum to the total variance of the model output.

==First-order indices==

A direct variance-based measure of sensitivity ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, called the "first-order sensitivity index", or "main effect index" is stated as follows,&lt;ref name="Sob1" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; S_i = \frac{V_i}{\operatorname{Var}(Y)} &lt;/math&gt;

This is the contribution to the output variance of the main effect of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, therefore it measures the effect of varying ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''alone'', but averaged over variations in other input parameters. It is standardised by the total variance to provide a fractional contribution. Higher-order interaction indices ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt; and so on can be formed by dividing other terms in the variance decomposition by Var(''Y''). Note that this has the implication that,

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^d S_i + \sum_{i&lt;j}^{d} S_{ij} + \cdots + S_{12 \dots d} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

==Total-effect index==
Using the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; and higher-order indices given above, one can build a picture of the importance of each variable in determining the output variance. However, when the number of variables is large, this requires the evaluation of 2&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;-1 indices, which can be too computationally demanding. For this reason, a measure known as the "Total-effect index" or "Total-order index", ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Ti''&lt;/sub&gt;, is used.&lt;ref&gt;Homma, T. and A. Saltelli (1996). Importance measures in global sensitivity analysis of nonlinear models. ''Reliability Engineering and System Safety'', '''52''', 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; This measures the contribution to the output variance of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''including'' all variance caused by its interactions, of any order, with any other input variables. It is given as,

:&lt;math&gt; S_{Ti} = \frac{E_{\textbf{X}_{\sim i}} \left(\operatorname{Var}_{X_i} (Y \mid \mathbf{X}_{\sim i}) \right)}{\operatorname{Var}(Y)} = 1 - \frac{\operatorname{Var}_{\textbf{X}_{\sim i}} \left(E_{X_i} (Y \mid \mathbf{X}_{\sim i}) \right)}{\operatorname{Var}(Y)} &lt;/math&gt;

Note that unlike the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^d S_{Ti} \geq 1 &lt;/math&gt;

due to the fact that the interaction effect between e.g. ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is counted in both ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Ti''&lt;/sub&gt; ''and'' ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Tj''&lt;/sub&gt; In fact, the sum of the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Ti''&lt;/sub&gt; will only be equal to 1 when the model is purely [[Additive map|additive]].

==Calculation of indices==
For analytically tractable functions, the indices above may be calculated analytically by evaluating the integrals in the decomposition. However, in the vast majority of cases they are estimated – this is usually done by the [[Monte Carlo method]].

===Sampling sequences===
[[File:Construction of ABi matrices in monte carlo estimation of sensitivity indices.png|thumb | right | 500px | An example of construction of '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; matrices with ''d''=3 and ''N''=4.]]
The Monte Carlo approach involves generating a sequence of randomly distributed points inside the unit hypercube (strictly speaking these will be [[Pseudorandom number generator|pseudorandom]]). In practice, it is common to substitute random sequences with [[low-discrepancy sequence]]s to improve the efficiency of the estimators. This is then known as the [[quasi-Monte Carlo method]]. Some low-discrepancy sequences commonly used in sensitivity analysis include the [[Sobol sequence]] and the [[Latin hypercube sampling|Latin hypercube]] design.

===Procedure===
To calculate the indices using the (quasi) Monte Carlo method, the following steps are used:&lt;ref name="Sobol2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Primer" /&gt;

# Generate an ''N''×2''d'' sample matrix, i.e. each row is a sample point in the hyperspace of 2''d'' dimensions. This should be done with respect to the probability distributions of the input variables.
# Use the first ''d'' columns of the matrix as matrix '''A''', and the remaining ''d'' columns as matrix '''B'''. This effectively gives two independent samples of ''N'' points in the ''d''-dimensional unit hypercube.
# Build ''d'' further ''N''×''d'' matrices '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;, for ''i'' = 1,2,...,d, such that the ''i''th column of '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; is equal to the ''i''th column of '''B''', and the remaining columns are from '''A'''.
# The '''A''', '''B''', and the ''d'' '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; matrices in total specify ''N''(''d''+2) points in the input space (one for each row). Run the model at each design point in the '''A''', '''B''', and '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; matrices, giving a total of ''N''(''d''+2) model evaluations –  the corresponding f('''A'''), f('''B''') and f('''A'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;) values.
# Calculate the sensitivity indices using the estimators below.

The accuracy of the estimators is of course dependent on ''N''. The value of ''N'' can be chosen by sequentially adding points and calculating the indices until the estimated values reach some acceptable convergence. For this reason, when using low-discrepancy sequences, it can be advantageous to use those that allow sequential addition of points (such as the Sobol sequence), as compared to those that do not (such as Latin hypercube sequences).

===Estimators===
There are a number of possible Monte Carlo estimators available for both indices. Two that are currently in general use are,&lt;ref name="Sobol2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Saltelli, Paola Annoni, Ivano Azzini, Francesca Campolongo, Marco Ratto, and Stefano Tarantola. Variance based sensitivity analysis of model output. Design and estimator for the total sensitivity index. ''Computer Physics Communications'', 181(2):259{270, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var}_{X_i}(E_{\mathbf{X}_{\sim i}}(Y|X_i)) \approx
  { \frac {1}{N}  \sum_{j=1}^{N}  f \left (  \mathbf{B} \right )_{j}  \left ( f   \left ( \mathbf{A}^i_B \right )_{j} -   f \left ( \mathbf{A} \right )_{j}  \right ) } &lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt; E_{\mathbf{X}_{\sim i}}\left(\operatorname{Var}_{X_i}\left(Y \mid \mathbf{X}_{\sim i} \right) \right) \approx {\frac {1}{2N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}
\left( f   \left ( \mathbf{A} \right )_{j} - f  \left (\mathbf{A}^i_B \right )_{j}\right )^2
} &lt;/math&gt;

for the estimation of the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Ti''&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.

===Computational expense===
For the estimation of the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Ti''&lt;/sub&gt; for all input variables, ''N''(''d''+2) model runs are required. Since ''N'' is often of the order of hundreds or thousands of runs, computational expense can quickly become a problem when the model takes a significant amount of time for a single run. In such cases, there are a number of techniques available to reduce the computational cost of estimating sensitivity indices, such as [[Sensitivity analysis#Emulators|emulators]], [[Sensitivity analysis#High-Dimensional Model Representations (HDMR)|HDMR]] and [[Sensitivity analysis#Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST)|FAST]].
