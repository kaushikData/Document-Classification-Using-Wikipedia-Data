'''Abdul Sattar Abu Risha''' ({{lang-ar|'''عبد الستار أبو ريشة'''}}) – '''Sheikh Abdul Sattar Eftikhan al-Rishawi''' الشيخ عبد الستار افتيخان الريشاوي – (born 1972 – September 13, 2007) was a high-profile [[Iraq]]i tribal [[sheikh]] of the [[Abu-Risha]] tribe. He was the leader of [[Sons of Iraq|an alliance]] of [[Iraq]]i [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Arab people|Arab]] tribes that opposed [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]].

Abu Risha was assassinated shortly after becoming an ally of the Iraqi government through forming an organisation of fellow tribal chiefs called the ''Sahawat al-Anbar'' (Anbar Awakening), based in [[Al Anbar Governorate|Anbar]]'s provincial capital of [[Ramadi]], some {{convert|70|mi|km}} west of [[Baghdad]].

==Life==
Abu Risha was the grandson of a tribal leader in the [[Iraqi revolt against the British]] occupying forces in 1920 and the son of a commander in the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] in 1941. Little is known about Abu Risha's life prior to the [[Iraq War]], albeit he reportedly ran a construction and import-export business with offices in [[Amman]] in [[Jordan]] and [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "he was called a [[warlord]] and a highway bandit, an oil smuggler and an opportunist".&lt;ref name=Bomb/&gt; Many of the Awakening leaders are believed to have at least tacitly supported the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]], though Sattar claimed he never did.

During the early part of the insurgency following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], as al-Qaeda's fighters tightened their grip on Ramadi, it is reported that they became increasingly repressive and challenged the tribal leaders' power. Soon they were kidnapping and beheading tribal Sunnis as part of a campaign of extortion and intimidation. Abdul Sattar's own father and two brothers were killed by al-Qaeda. During the late summer of 2006, he began enlisting his fellow sheikhs in ''Sahawat al-Anbar'' and encouraging members of his tribe to join the local police force. The [[United States|U.S.]] forces under Lt. Col. Tony Deane encouraged Sattar and provided security for the initial meetings of the Al Anbar tribal meetings at Sattar's compound in western Ramadi; these early meetings were the beginning of what grew into the [[Anbar Salvation Council]] by the fall of 2006; in March 2007 the Council counted 41 clans from Anbar province.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/25/AR2007032500600.html Sunni Sheiks Join Fight Vs. Insurgency], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', March 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The development led to a sharp reduction of violence in the province and forced many al-Qaeda fighters to flee to other regions of Iraq.

==Death==
Abu Risha was assassinated on September 13, 2007, along with three of his guards by an [[improvised explosive device]] planted on the road near the gate of his house in Ramadi.&lt;ref name=Bomb&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/13/AR2007091300490.html Bomb Kills a Key Sunni Ally of U.S.], ''[[The Washington Post]], September 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda took responsibility for the attack and several dozen people were arrested in connection with the killing, including the head of his own security detail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/I/IRAQ_ARRESTS?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2007-09-21-17-45-24 25 Arrests in Slaying of Prominent Sunni], [[Associated Press]], September 21, 2007 {{dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sheikh's funeral attracted about 1,500 mourners, including Iraq's national security adviser [[Mowaffak al-Rubaie]], Interior Minister Jawad [[Jawad Bulani]], Defense Minister General [[Qadir Obeidi]] and Lieutenant-General [[Raymond Odierno]], second in command of U.S. forces in Iraq, and sparked vows of revenge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1477322720070914 Iraqis vow to fight al Qaeda after sheikh death], [[Reuters]], Sep 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; After Abu Risha's death, his brother, Sheik [[Ahmed Abu Risha]], was selected to take over leadership of the Anbar Salvation Council by the tribal leaders of the province.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/world/middleeast/14iraq.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=middleeast Sunni Sheik Who Backed U.S. in Iraq Is Killed], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allan Walfrid Staffans''' (13 February 1880 – 19 October 1946) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[technician]], [[vuorineuvos]] and [[Shipbuilding|shipbuilder]].

Staffans began his career at [[Kone- ja Siltarakennus|Maskin- och Brobyggnad]] (Maskin o. Bro) shipyard in [[Helsinki]] in 1898. Later he worked in [[shipbuilding]] industry in [[Siberia]] until [[World War I]], when he returned to Finland. In 1918 he led an operation for eliminating of [[cannon]]s in [[Suomenlinna|Viapori fortress]] in Helsinki; the significance of the event has been later disputed by historians.

In 1920 Staffans was selected the manager of [[Vulcan (Turku shipyard)|Vulcan]] [[shipyard]] in [[Turku]]. He organised a merger with its competitor [[Crichton (Turku shipyard)|Crichton]] creating [[Crichton-Vulcan]] shipyard, which grew under his leadership the most significant shipbuilding company of Finland. The yard built the most important vessels of the [[Finnish Navy]], including [[submarine]]s and two large [[coastal defence ship]]s.

After [[World War II]] Staffans participated in negotiations of [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations to Soviet Union]].

Staffans had two daughters with his wife Selma Elisabeth née Kjellin.

== Studies and early career ==
Staffans was born in [[Vaasa|Nikolaistad]], [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], for [[sailor]] Matts Staffans and Amanda Maria Sofia [[née]] Törner. He first learned at folkschool and then graduated [[technician]] in [[mechanical engineering]] in [[Vaasa University of Applied Sciences|Nikolaistad Industry School]] in 1898.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Allan Staffans"/&gt; By end of the 19th century the Nikolaistad shipbuilding industry, which once was a flourishing branch in the area, was almost disappeared. Staffans moved to [[Helsinki]] where he got a position at [[Kone- ja Siltarakennus|Maskin o. Bro]] shipyard.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Allan Staffans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NvK: s.98"/&gt; Staffans soon reached [[Master craftsman|master's]] level in shipbuilding.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.98"/&gt;

== Siberia years ==
In 1902 he was sent to work in [[Siberia]] to lead [[Steamboat|steam ship]] and [[dredging]] vessel building from materials transported from Finland.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.98"/&gt; The parts were taken by rail to river [[Amur River|Amur]] delta and then built in place. The primary customer was the [[Imperial Russian Navy]], which joined the vessels to its [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific fleet]] to mainly protect the traffic of the large rivers. Staffans travelled to far east total six times, some of the journeys he did with his family. The last journey Staffans did through [[Suez Canal]] and [[Indian Ocean]], and he also stopped by in [[British Raj|India]], [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Staffans planned to leave for few years to study in [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1914 but outbreak of [[World War I]] changed his plans.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Allan Staffans"/&gt;

== Viapori sabotage ==
[[File:Suomenlinna 102.jpg|270px|thumb|One of the Viapori cannons: 11&amp;nbsp;inch Pattern 1867 coastal gun.]]
After [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Finland declared independence]] the [[Finnish Civil War]] broke out in January 1918 and Helsinki was soon taken over by the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Finnish Red Guards]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Allan Staffans"/&gt; The [[Suomenlinna|Viapori]] fortress in front of Helsinki was still housed by the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian soldiers]] and its [[cannon]]s were seen as a threat against [[White Guard (Finland)|the Finnish White Guards]].&lt;ref name="Suomenlinna: sinivalkoinen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/historia/suomalaisen_varuskunnan_aika/sinivalkoinen_suomenlinna|title=Sinivalkoinen Suomenlinna|publisher=Suomenlinnan hoitokunta|location=Helsinki|page=|pages=|at=|language=Finnish|accessdate=2013-04-02|quote=|ref=|separator=|postscript=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617170603/http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/historia/suomalaisen_varuskunnan_aika/sinivalkoinen_suomenlinna|archive-date=2013-06-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allan Staffans went to the fortress with some twenty men to dismount the locks of the cannons. The work started from the outer [[bastion]]s and the main fortress followed after. The locks weighed hundreds of kilos were dismounted by use of [[Hoist (device)|winch hoists]], packed into wooden caskets and stored in the warehouses of the [[Artillery battery|batteries]]. The men moved on ice by feet and pulling the equipment on a [[sledge]]. The work was dangerous due to patrolling red guards, who reached over the cannons for their own use. The Russian soldiers were not always willing to accept the disarmament, but the good relationship Staffans had built with the Russian military during his work in Maskin o. Bro helped, although time to time the discussions were heated. The work was done by 15 March.&lt;ref name="HS: Viapori"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salonen |first1=Juha |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title=Riisuttiinko Viapori aseista huijauksella vai merilinnakkeen johdon tietoisella tuella? |journal=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] |volume= |issue=2008-03-22 |pages= |publisher=Sanoma WSOY |language=Finnish |trans-title=Was Viapori disarmed with a ploy or with knowledge and support of the sea fortress command? |doi= |url= http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/arkisto/Riisuttiinko+Viapori+aseista+huijauksella+vai+merilinnakkeen+johdon+tietoisella+tuella/aaHS20080322SI2KA0286n?src=haku&amp;ref=arkisto%2F |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The White Guards got help from [[German Army (German Empire)|the German army]] which invaded in southern Finland in beginning of April. The Russian military handed Viapori over to the Finns on 14 April.&lt;ref name="Suomenlinna: sinivalkoinen"/&gt;

After the war the newspaper [[Hufvudstadsbladet]] published an article, according which Staffans had duped the Russian military personnel by typing himself an attorney letter fooling the fortress organisation up to the highest command. The operation was described as a "historic deed".&lt;ref name="HS: Viapori"/&gt; As a memory of the event, there is a bust of Staffans in the fortress.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Allan Staffans"/&gt;

However, the Russian commander of [[artillery]] in Viapori [[colonel]] Balzam wrote a reply to a Russian speaking newspaper in Helsinki, that the operation was done under order of the commandant of the fortress and the directive of the Russian navy headquarters to ensure that none of the fighting parties would use the artillery against the city, and Staffans and his men were paid for their work by the Russian military.&lt;ref name="HS: Viapori"/&gt;

Russia and Germany had agreed in the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk peace treaty]] that the [[Baltic Fleet|Russian Baltic fleet]] and coast fortresses would not get involved in military operations in Finland. It also came out afterwards that the Russian soldiers were not very interested in the mutual skirmishes of Finns.&lt;ref name="Suomenlinna: sinivalkoinen"/&gt; More information about the disputed event has been recently found from a 26 March 1918 dated report written by Oskar Gros who was a member in Staffans's team. The report tells that the work was done under supervision of Staffans and also consent with the Russian officers, who wanted to avoid that operative cannons had ended up to the hands of the Red Guards or German troops.&lt;ref name="HS: Viapori"/&gt;

It is speculated, that a possible motive for exaggeration of the action was the Finnish White Guards' crave to get a part of the glory Helsinki conquest, which was mainly done by Germans.&lt;ref name="HS: Viapori"/&gt;

After the war ended Staffans stayed serving the Finnish army in the fortress during years 1918–1920&lt;ref name="NvK: s.98"/&gt; under commandant office as the technical manager of the dry dock.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Allan Staffans"/&gt;

Staffans was appointed general manager of [[Vulcan (Turku shipyard)|Vulcan shipyard]] in [[Turku]] at the beginning of 1921.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.98"/&gt; The company had got into financial trouble as the orders from the Russian navy had ceased, some of the deliveries had not been paid and the company had lost its property in [[Saint Petersburg]]. The company made heavy losses. Staffans was selected manager because of his experience, high expertise and leadership skills.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.85-89"&gt;Knorring: ''Korsmanin verstaasta Vulcaniin.'' p. 85–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922 Staffans negotiated with the state about repairing of an old Russian [[submarine]]. As the company had no experience about submarines, Staffans searched for contacts which had the technology. Although the project turned out to be hopeless, Staffans managed to get to know the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company [[NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw|IvS]], which was eager to start a submarine project with Vulcan.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.85-89"/&gt; IvS was a [[Weimar Republic|German]] [[Dummy corporation|dummy company]] set up to maintain and develop the German submarine engineering expertise, when it was not allowed for Germany to build its own submarines.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.97-104"&gt;Knorring: ''Suomen laivaston uudisrakennukset.'' p. 97–104.&lt;/ref&gt; During 1922–1923 Staffans attended in committees which were planning an updated naval defence strategy for Finland. Vulcan and IvS signed a secret contract about co-operation for submarine engineering in November 1923.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.85-89"/&gt; According to the contract, IvS promised to give all the needed engineering support in case Vulcan wants to build submarines.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.97-104"/&gt; In the following month Staffans negotiated about a merger with a competitor, [[Crichton (Turku shipyard)|Crichton]] yard, which was located next to Vulcan, at the other side of the [[Aura River (Finland)|river Aura]].&lt;ref name="NvK: s.85-89"/&gt;

== Crichton-Vulcan ==
The merger of Crichton and Vulcan took place on 18 August 1924 and Staffans was chosen unanimously to lead the new, united [[Crichton-Vulcan]] yard. The yard got only few orders and Staffans put his hope on getting orders from the [[Finnish Navy]]. The naval defence strategy was ready in 1925 and included four submarines, two [[coastal defence ship]]s and four [[torpedo boat]]s. The ministry of defence sent inquiries for 22 companies for 400-ton and 100-ton submarines. Finally, Staffans's efforts were rewarded, when the state ordered first in 1926 one and then in 1927 two more 400-ton submarines from Crichton-Vulcan. Another order for a 100-ton submarine went to [[Hietalahti shipyard]] in Helsinki. The project schedules were delayed by months due to [[Strike action|strikes]] in 1927. The submarines [[Finnish submarine Vetehinen|Vetehinen]], [[Finnish submarine Vesihiisi|Vesihiisi]] and [[Finnish submarine Iku-Turso|Iku-Turso]] were [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] between June 1930 and May 1931. IvS and Crichton-Vulcan made a secret agreement about one more submarine, [[Finnish submarine Vesikko|CV-707]], which Germans used for testing. The vessel stayed finally in the Finnish navy and was named Vesikko.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.97-104"/&gt;

Simultaneously with the submarine projects, the yard worked  already on two 3&amp;nbsp;800&amp;nbsp;ton coastal defence ship projects. Crichton-Vulcan signed contracts for the ships in November 1928. Building of such large and demanding ships required investments in facilities and cranes; also the number of employees was increased. The first one of the ships, [[Finnish coastal defence ship Väinämöinen|Väinämöinen]], was launched in December 1930 and [[Finnish coastal defence ship Ilmarinen|Ilmarinen]] followed in July 1931.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.97-104"/&gt;

The investments required capital and finally Crichton-Vulcan was sold to Maskin o. Bro, which had taken over previously the Hietalahti yard in Helsinki. The acquisition improved the company's financial basis and during the 1930s Crichton-Vulcan had grown the strongest and most modern shipyard of Finland under Staffans's leadership.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.97-104"/&gt; The most important investments were a [[Crane (machine)|crane]] with a capacity of 100&amp;nbsp;tonnes and a dry dock.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.107-113"&gt;Knorring: ''Suuri nousu.'' p. 107–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s Crichton-Vulcan managed to sell ships to [[Soviet Union]]. Staffans's excellent [[Russian language]] skills proved helpful in the negotiations. Contracts for total 29 ships to Soviet Union were signed; the orders were vital in the middle of [[Great Depression|the depression]].&lt;ref name="NvK: s.106-107"&gt;Knorring: ''Neuvostokauppa 1930-luvulla.'' p. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wärtsilä ==
[[File:Crichton-Vulcan, launch of SS Bore II.jpg|330px|thumb|Launch of SS Bore II at Crichton-Vulcan in 1938.]]
The company got again a new owner when [[Wärtsilä]] took over Maskin o. Bro, including Crichton-Vulcan. The General Manager [[Wilhelm Wahlforss]] trusted and respected Staffans; in fact, Staffans was one of those few people who could disagree and argue openly with Wahlforss without being afraid of consequences. Wahlforss did not question his authority in Crichton-Vulcan and Staffans could continue his investment program.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.107-113"/&gt;

Crichton-Vulcan got more demanding orders at the end of the 1930s; a big step was 2&amp;nbsp;000-dwt steam ship ''Rigel'' made for [[Finland Steamship Company|FÅA]].&lt;ref name="NvK: s.107-113"/&gt; This was followed by more modern and challenging projects; total 17 ships were ordered between January 1936 and September 1939.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.158-162"&gt;Knorring: ''1924–1944.'' p. 158–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Staffans's right hand was the company's chief engineer Gösta Rusko, who was also his son-in-law.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.107-113"/&gt;

The biggest investments of the late 1930s were the new office building "White House", foundry and large machine workshops. The latter ones were built especially for [[diesel engine]] production. By using his old contacts from ivS, Staffans made a licence production agreement with [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Krupp Germaniawerft AG]] in summer 1938. The engine production could be started only in summer 1941, when all the needed machines were in place, and finally just two Krupp engines were built. These were the first diesel engines of Wärtsilä.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.107-113"/&gt;

== Second World War ==
When [[Winter War]] broke out in 1939, Turku was heavily bombed by the Soviet air forces, but Crichton-Vulcan avoided of large damages. When the peace came in 1940, Finland signed a new trading agreement with Soviet Union and soon Staffans and the Soviet [[Machinoimport]] signed a contract of four tug boats; this was followed by another order of 12 more slightly larger vessels of the same kind. No single vessel could be delivered before [[Continuation War|Finland was again in war with Soviet Union]] in summer 1941. However, Staffans found a new customer: he agreed delivering of the ships to German [[Kriegsmarine]] instead, and the yard got even few more orders for similar ships from Germany. In addition, Staffans signed contracts for [[cargo ships]] for [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Total 38 vessels were handed over to Germany before [[Lapland War|Finland got at war with Germany in September 1944]]. The yard suffered some damages in the Continual War.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.115-118"&gt;Knorring: ''Sotavuodet.'' p. 115–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

== War reparations ==
After the war ended, Finland had to pay heavy [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations to Soviet Union]], which wanted the payment mainly in machinery. The largest and most demanding ships were assigned to Wärtsilä yards. Staffans was called together with Wahlforss and the Hietalahti yard manager [[August Jansson]] to negotiate about the ship types. Once again, Staffans's excellent knowledge about Russian language and Russian mentality proved helpful. The agreement about material list was signed in December 1944 by [[Andrei Zhdanov]] from the [[Allied Commission]] and the [[Prime Minister of Finland|prime minister of Finland]], [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi|J.K. Paasikivi]].&lt;ref name="NvK: s.119-125"&gt;Knorring: ''Sodan jälkeen.'' p. 119–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Staffans was not involved into the war reparation industry as he fell ill and died in 1946. During his period the number of personnel at Crichton-Vulcan yard had grown from 300 up to 3&amp;nbsp;000.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Allan Staffans"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1904 Staffans married Selma Elisabeth née Kjellin, who was from Helsinki. They got two daughters: Margit and Gunvor. Margit married later Gösta Rusko, the main engineer of Crichton-Vulcan. The younger daughter Gunvor was married to professor [[John Rosas]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Allan Staffans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NvK: s.98"/&gt;

Staffans was a [[vice consul]] for [[Netherlands]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Allan Staffans"/&gt;

In 1942 Staffans wrote a book called ''Skeppsbyggare och resenär i Östasien'' about his experiences in Siberia in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Allan Staffans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NvK: s.98"/&gt;

Staffans faced two major personal losses in 1943 when first his closest colleague and son-in-law Gösta Rusko became seriously ill and perished in April. The widow and Staffans's daughter Margit Rusko died only two months later. Staffans and his wife took care of their two children after.&lt;ref name="NvK: s.115-118"/&gt;

The family moved permanently in Turku in the early 1920s, but they also had a summer villa in [[Kirkkonummi]]. The villa had to be given to Soviet Union after the Continual War as a part of [[Porkkala (naval base)|Porkkala lease area]]. When Soviet Union returned the area back to Finland in 1956, the widow Selma Staffans moved in, and despite of her high age, she participated eagerly into rebuilding of the area.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Allan Staffans"/&gt;

== Career ==

=== Journalist ===
Sorkin first joined ''[[The New York Times]]'' as a student intern during his senior year in high school. He also worked for the paper while he was in college, publishing 71 articles before he graduated. He began by writing media and technology articles while assisting the advertising columnist, Stuart Elliott. Sorkin spent the summer of 1996 working for ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|Businessweek]]'', before returning to ''The New York Times''.  He moved to [[London]] for part of 1998. While there, he wrote about European business and technology for ''The New York Times'' and then returned to Cornell to complete his studies. At Cornell, he was vice president of the [[Sigma Pi]] fraternity.

==== Mergers and acquisitions reporter ====
Sorkin joined ''The New York Times'' full-time in 1999 as the newspaper's European mergers and acquisitions reporter, and was based in London. In 2000, Sorkin became the paper's chief mergers and acquisitions reporter, based in New York, a position he still holds. In 2001, Sorkin founded "DealBook," an online daily financial report published by the ''Times''. As Editor-at-Large of "DealBook," Sorkin writes a weekly column of the same name. Sorkin is also an assistant editor of business and finance news for the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/by/andrew-ross-sorkin|title=Andrew Ross Sorkin|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorkin has broken news of major [[mergers and acquisitions]], including Chase's acquisition of [[JPMorgan Chase]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s acquisition of [[Compaq]]. He also led ''The New York Times''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' coverage of the largest takeover in history, [[Vodafone]]'s $183 billion hostile bid for Mannesmann. Additionally, he broke the news of [[IBM]]'s sale of its PC business to [[Lenovo]], [[Boston Scientific]]'s $25 billion acquisition of [[Guidant]] and [[Symantec]]'s $13 billion deal for [[Veritas Software]], and reported on News Corp.'s acquisition of [[Dow Jones]] and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.

Sorkin has reported on the [[Wall Street]] [[financial crisis]], including the collapse of [[Bear Stearns]] and [[Lehman Brothers]], and the government bailout of other major [[investment banks]] and [[AIG]]. He has also written about the troubled American [[auto industry]].

In 2007, Sorkin was one of the first journalists to identify and criticize a tax loophole for private equity firms and hedge funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/business/18sorkin.html |title=Bobbing as the Tax Man Weaves |date=17 May 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first wrote about the topic in a column in March 2007, calling the tax treatment a "charade",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/business/yourmoney/11deal.html|title=Of Private Equity, Politics and Income Taxes|date=11 March 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later wrote about it on the front page of ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/21/business/21tax.html|title=Congress Weighs End to Private Equity Tax Break|date=21 June 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written at least a half dozen articles critiquing the tax practice by private equity firms and advocated for the government to end the loophole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/business/10sorkin.html|title=Putting a Bull’s-Eye on a Tax Loophole|date=10 March 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Sorkin wrote a series of columns criticizing American corporations for trying to lower their US tax bill by merging with smaller foreign companies in a transaction known as an "inversion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/a-deal-to-dodge-the-tax-man-in-america/|title=A Deal to Dodge the Tax Man in America|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticized the Wall Street banks that advised US companies to pursue such deals, describing the banks as "corporate co-conspirators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/banks-cash-in-on-mergers-intended-to-elude-taxes/|title=Banks Cash in on Mergers Intended to Elude Taxes|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorkin called on the government to end the practice. On September 22, 2014, the Obama Administration changed the tax laws to make it more difficult for US companies to merge to avoid taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/22/presidents-statement-todays-treasury-department-action-inversions|title=The President's Statement on Today's Treasury Department Action on Inversions|work=White House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] surveillance program and [[Edward Snowden]] situation, Sorkin said, "I would arrest him and now I'd almost arrest [[Glenn Greenwald]], the journalist who seems to be out there, he wants to help him get to Ecuador."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/06/24/greenwald-beltway-media-types-are-courtiers-to-power/ Greenwald: Beltway media types are ‘courtiers to power’], ''Washington Post'', By Erik Wemple, Published: June 24, 2013, retrieved from washingtonpost.com on 6/24/2013&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Sorkin apologized for the comment; Greenwald accepted, tweeting "Thank you: accepted &amp; appreciated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/349536779558338560|title=Glenn Greenwald on Twitter|work=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing his record after his anti-Greenwald outburst, [[Matt Taibbi]] described Sorkin as "a shameless, ball-gargling prostitute for Wall Street".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Matt Taibbi|authorlink=Matt Taibbi|date=27 June 2013|title=Hey, MSM: All Journalism is Advocacy Journalism |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/hey-msm-all-journalism-is-advocacy-journalism-78133/ |publisher=[[Rolling Stone|rollingstone.com]] |accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DealBook===
In October 2001, while a journalist at ''The New York Times'', Sorkin started DealBook, a newsletter about deal-making and Wall Street.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Andrew Ross Sorkin: The man behind Dealbook|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/8113789/Andrew-Ross-Sorkin-The-man-behind-Dealbook.html |website=The Telegraph |access-date = 2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; DealBook was one of the first financial news aggregation services on the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In March 2006, Sorkin introduced a companion website published on ''The New York Times'', with updated news and original analysis throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/03/01/more-about-dealbook/ |title=More About DealBook - DealBook Blog - NYTimes.com |publisher=Dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2006-03-01 |accessdate=2010-05-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100509040820/http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/03/01/more-about-dealbook/| archivedate= 9 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, DealBook won a [[Webby Award]] for Best Business Blog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?season=11 |title=Webby Nominees &amp; Winners |publisher=Webbyawards.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520212927/http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?season=11 |archivedate=20 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it won a SABEW award for overall excellence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabew.com/contest/2007-2008/winners/onlinewin.htm Sabew.Com]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the site won an EPpy Award for Best Business Blog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://royal.reliaserve.com/eppy/winners2008.html Royal.Reliaserve.Com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130044424/http://royal.reliaserve.com/eppy/winners2008.html |date=January 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
In July 2011, Sorkin became a co-anchor on CNBC's ''[[Squawk Box]]'' in addition to his duties at ''The New York Times''. Sorkin has appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show, ''[[Charlie Rose (talk show)|Charlie Rose]]'' and ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'' on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], MSNBC's ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]'' and ''[[Morning Joe]]'', ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[The Chris Matthews Show]]'', HBO's ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', the [[BBC World Service]], Comedy Central's ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', and was a frequent guest host of [[CNBC]]'s ''Squawk Box'' before joining the ensemble. Sorkin also hosted a weekly seven-part, half-hour PBS talk-show series called ''It's the Economy, NY'', which focused on how the evolving economic crisis was affecting New Yorkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thirteen.org/itstheeconomyny/ |title=It's The Economy, NY |publisher=Thirteen |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709222120/http://www.thirteen.org/itstheeconomyny/ |archive-date=2010-07-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorkin is the co-creator for the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[Billions (TV series)|Billions]]'', an American television drama series created with [[Brian Koppelman]] and [[David Levien]],  starring [[Paul Giamatti]] and [[Damian Lewis]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Billions Co-Creator Andrew Ross Sorkin Reveals How He Brought Wall Street Drama to TV|url = http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/billions-showtime-andrew-ross-sorkin-brings-wall-street-drama-to-tv|magazine = Vanity Fair |access-date = 2016-02-22|first = Jon|last = Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is loosely based on crusading federal prosecutor of financial crimes [[Preet Bharara]], the former [[U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York]].&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s Office Gets Hollywood Treatment in Showtime Series|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/manhattan-u-s-attorney-preet-bhararas-office-gets-hollywood-treatment-in-showtime-series-1451947972|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2016-02-22|issn = 0099-9660|first = Erica|last = Orden}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show premiered in January 2016.

'''Benjamin Crowninshield Bradlee''' ({{nowrap|August 26}}, 1921 – {{nowrap|October 21}}, 2014) was an American newspaperman. He was the executive editor of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' from 1968 to 1991.&lt;ref name="investPower"/&gt; He became a national figure during the [[:Category:Presidency of Richard Nixon|presidency of Richard Nixon]], when he challenged the federal government over the right to publish the [[Pentagon Papers]] and oversaw the publication of [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]]'s stories documenting the [[Watergate scandal]]. At his death he held the title of vice president at-large of the ''Post''.

He was also an advocate for education and the study of history,&lt;ref name="investPower"/&gt; including working for years as an active trustee on the boards of several major educational, historical, and archeological research institutions.&lt;ref name="investPower"/&gt;

==Early life==
A member of the [[Boston Brahmin]] [[Crowninshield family]], Bradlee was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on {{nowrap|August 26}}, 1921. His father was [[Frederick Bradlee|Frederick Josiah Bradlee, Jr.]] (1892–1970), a direct descendant of Nathan Bradley—the first American Bradley, born in the colony of Massachusetts in 1631. His mother, Josephine de Gersdorff (1896–1975), was awarded the French [[Legion of Honour]] for starting an orphanage that sheltered children from Nazi Germany during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Honors&gt;{{cite web |title=Honors |date=December 2, 2007 |accessdate=October 22, 2014 |website=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/01/AR2007120101576.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradlee's maternal grandfather, Carl August de Gersdorff (1865–1944), the son of a German immigrant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Patrick |title=The Ultimate Paper Trail |date=July 7, 2006 |accessdate=October 21, 2014 |website=FishbowlDC |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowldc/the-ultimate-paper-trail_b2816 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023010941/http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowldc/the-ultimate-paper-trail_b2816 |archivedate=October 23, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a wealthy New York lawyer. Bradlee's maternal grandmother was Helen Suzette Crowninshield (1868–1941), daughter of artist [[Frederic Crowninshield]] (1845–1918), another member of the Crowninshield family.&lt;ref name="welch"&gt;{{cite book |title= Welch Genealogy |first=Charles Alfred |last=Welch |pages=35–36|url=https://archive.org/details/welchgenealogy00welc }}&lt;/ref&gt; His great-great-uncle was U.S. lawyer [[Joseph Hodges Choate]], 34th U.S. ambassador to Britain, and his great uncle was [[Frank Crowninshield|Francis Welch "Frank" Crowninshield]], the creator and editor of ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913-1936)|Vanity Fair]]'', and a roommate of [[Condé Montrose Nast|Condé Nast]]. He had a brother named Frederick Bradlee (1919–2003), a writer and Broadway stage actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Frederic Bradlee -- Actor and Writer, 84 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/16/nyregion/frederic-bradlee-actor-and-writer-84.html |accessdate=June 15, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 16, 2003 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150527233110/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/16/nyregion/frederic-bradlee-actor-and-writer-84.html |archivedate=May 27, 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/person.php?id=32787 Frederick Bradlee; Internet Broadway Database] accessed September 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Chevalier Josephine de Gersdorff, Bradlee's mother, was a direct descendant of [[Heinrich XXIX, Count of Reuss-Ebersdorf]], who was a [[lineal descendant]] of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], King [[John of Denmark]], King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV of Poland]], and [[John V, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst]]. Through his father Frederick, Bradlee was also a lineal descendant of King [[Henry VII of England]] by an unknown British woman through their son Sir [[Roland de Velville]]. His maternal great-grandfather was Dr. Ernst Bruno von Gersdorff, who was a third cousin of [[Queen Victoria]] of the United Kingdom through Heinrich XXIX.&lt;ref name="Third Cousins To Queen Victoria"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Gary Boyd|title=Surprising Connections #6 and 7: Boston Cousins of Queen Victoria and Yankee Anecestors of Mrs. Thomas Philip "Tip" O'Neill Jr.|url=http://www.americanancestors.org/boston-cousins-of-queen-victoria-and-yankee-ancestors/|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society - Founded 1845|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Desendancy of John II of France and Bonne of Bohemia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Gary Boyd|title=The Royal Descendants of 600 Immigrants to the American Colonies or the United States|year=2008|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Company|location=Baltimore, Maryland|isbn=978-0-8063-1786-1|page=910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradlee, the second of three children, grew up in a wealthy family with domestic staff.&lt;ref name="washpost2014"/&gt; With his brother, Freddy, and sister, Constance, he learned [[French language|French]], took piano lessons, and went to the symphony and the opera.&lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt; The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] decimated the family's wealth however. During the [[Clutch Plague]], Bradlee's father worked odd jobs to support his family, including keeping the books for various clubs and institutions and supervising the janitors at the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt;

Bradlee attended [[Dexter School]] before finishing at [[St. Mark's School (Massachusetts)|St. Mark's School]], where he played varsity baseball.&lt;ref name="washpost2014"/&gt; While attending St. Mark's, he contracted [[polio]].&lt;ref name="washpost2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt; He exercised regularly at home and developed strong arms and chest. He was able to fight off the effects of polio and could walk without limping.&lt;ref name="washpost2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt; Thereafter he attended [[Harvard College]], where he was a member of the [[A.D.

== Career ==
===World War II===
Bradlee received his [[Officer's commission|naval commission]] two hours after graduating in 1942, joined the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]], and worked as a communications officer in the Pacific during World War II. His duties included handling classified and coded cables, serving primarily on the destroyer [[USS Philip (DD-498)|USS ''Philip'']] fighting off the shore of Guam and arriving at [[Guadalcanal]] with the Second Transport Group, part of Task Group 62.4, commanded by Rear Admiral [[Norman Scott (admiral)|Norman Scott]]. Bradlee's main battles were [[Vella Lavella]], Saipan, Tinian, and Bougainville. He also fought in the biggest naval battle ever fought, the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] in the [[Philippines Campaign (1944–45)|Philippines Campaign]], in the [[Borneo Campaign]], and made every landing in the [[Solomon Islands campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Benjamin C. |last=Bradlee |title=Answering the Call: Benjamin C.

===Post-World War II===
After the war, in 1946, Bradlee became a reporter at the ''[[New Hampshire Sunday News]]'', a venture he helped launch. After he sold the paper, in 1948 he started working for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as a reporter.&lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt; He got to know associate publisher Philip Graham, who was the son-in-law of the publisher, [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer]]. On {{nowrap|November 1}}, 1950, Bradlee was alighting from a streetcar in front of the White House just as [[Truman assassination attempt|two Puerto Rican nationalists attempted to shoot their way]] into [[Blair House]] in an attempt to kill President [[Harry S. Truman]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hunter and John Bainbridge, Jr., ''American Gunfight: The Plot To Kill Harry Truman - And The Shoot-Out That Stopped It'', Simon &amp; Schuster (2005), {{ISBN|0-7432-6068-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 Graham helped Bradlee become assistant [[attaché|press attaché]] in the American embassy in Paris &lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt;

===Government work===
In 1952, Bradlee joined the staff of the Office of U.S. Information and Educational Exchange (USIE), the embassy's propaganda unit. USIE produced films, magazines, research, speeches, and news items for use by the [[CIA]] throughout Europe. USIE (later known as [[USIA]]) also controlled the [[Voice of America]], a means of disseminating pro-American "cultural information" worldwide. While at the USIE, according to a Justice Department memo from an assistant U.S. attorney in the [[Rosenberg Trial]], Bradlee was helping the [[CIA]] manage European propaganda regarding the spying conviction and execution of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] on {{nowrap|June 19}}, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mr. Maran &lt;!-- as given --&gt; |title=Office Memorandum |date=December 13, 1952 |accessdate=October 25, 2014 |url=http://www.namebase.org/foia/bradlee.html |publisher=United States Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memo, addressed to U.S. Attorney Myles Lane and dated December 13, 1952, states that "[Mr. Bradlee] further advised that he was sent here by Robert Thayer, who is the head of the CIA in Paris ... he stated that he was supposed to have been met by a representative of the CIA at the airport but missed connections" and that "he has been trying to get in touch with [CIA Director] Allen Dulles." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davis |first=Deborah |date=1991 |title=Katharine the Great: Katharine Graham and Her Washington Post Empire.  |location= New York|publisher= Sheridan Press|page= 286 |isbn= 9780941781138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This memorandum was cited as evidence of Bradlee's CIA connections by author Deborah Davis in her 1979 biography of Washington Post publisher [[Katharine Graham]], ''[[Katharine the Great|Katharine the Great: Katharine Graham and her Washington Post Empire]]''. Graham and Bradlee, in a controversial action that drew widespread accusations of censorship, demanded and obtained the recall of the book by Davis's publisher, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which first disavowed the book, and then recalled and shredded 20,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Felsenthal |first=Carol |date=1993 |title=Power, Privilege and the Post: The Katharine Graham Story |location=New York |publisher=Seven Stories Press |pages=369–70 |isbn=9781888363869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis subsequently won a judgment against her publisher, however,&lt;ref&gt;Felsenthal, ''Power, Privilege and the Post: The Katharine Graham Story,'' p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; and the Justice Department memorandum that formed the primary basis for her claims regarding Bradlee's CIA affiliation was never disavowed, even by Bradlee himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradlee|first=Ben|title=A Good Life – Newspapering and Other Adventures|date=1995 |location= New York|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |pages=267–8 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared in two subsequent editions of Davis's book without challenge and was cited by author Carol Felsenthal, in her 1999 book ''Power, Privilege, and The Post: The Katharine Graham Story''. Reporter Christopher Reed, in his obituary on Bradlee in ''[[The Guardian]]'', states that Bradlee "spent many years undercover as a counter-espionage informant, a government propagandist and an unofficial asset of the Central Intelligence Agency," initially by promulgating "CIA-directed European propaganda urging the controversial execution of the convicted American spies Ethel and Julius Rosenberg."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reed |first=Christopher |date=2014-10-21 |title=Ben Bradlee Obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/22/ben-bradlee-dies-washington-post-editor-watergate |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradlee was officially employed by USIE until 1953, and he began working for ''Newsweek'' in 1954.&lt;ref name=nyt2014 /&gt; While based in France, Bradlee divorced his first wife and married Antoinette Pinchot in 1957.&lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt; At the time of the marriage, Antoinette's sister, [[Mary Pinchot Meyer]], was married to [[Cord Meyer]],&lt;ref name="Daily Beast"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bizarre Tale of Ben Bradlee, JFK, and the Master Spy|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/22/the-bizarre-tale-of-ben-bradlee-jfk-and-the-master-spy.html|publisher=Daily Beast|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a key figure in [[Operation Mockingbird]],&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt; a CIA program to influence the media. Antoinette Bradlee was also a close friend of Cicely d'Autremont, who was married to CIA counterintelligence chief [[James Jesus Angleton]]. Bradlee became friends with Angleton&lt;ref name="Daily Beast" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt; but the two allegedly parted ways after the October 12, 1964, murder of Bradlee's sister-in-law Mary Pinchot Meyer, whose CIA connections and romantic ties to the late President John F. Kennedy made her death the object of intense scrutiny. Bradlee and Angleton gave conflicting accounts of the events surrounding the search for and disposition of the diary in which Pinchot Meyer recorded her affair with Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Ron and Nobile, Phillip. "The Curious Aftermath of JFK's Best and Brightest Affair." ''New Times''. July 9, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, while working as a reporter for ''[[Newsweek]]'', Bradlee created controversy when he interviewed members of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]]. They were [[Algeria]]n guerrillas who were in rebellion against the French government at the time.
According to Deborah Davis, author of the [[Katharine Graham]] biography ''Katharine the Great'', this had all the "earmarks of an intelligence operation". As a result of these interviews, Bradlee was forced to leave France.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|first=Christopher |last=Reed |title=Ben Bradlee obituary |date=October 21, 2014 |accessdate=October 23, 2014 |website=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/22/ben-bradlee-dies-washington-post-editor-watergate |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022024449/http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/22/ben-bradlee-dies-washington-post-editor-watergate |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Washington Post''===
[[File:Weekend at Newport- Golfing. Ben Bradlee, President Kennedy. Newport, RI (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Bradlee became friends with John F. Kennedy, golfing together in 1963]]
As a reporter in the 1950s, Bradlee became close friends with then-senator [[John F. Kennedy]], who had graduated from Harvard&lt;ref name="Kennedy Harvard"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|title=John F. Kennedy graduates from Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, June 1940.|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/WQWPwtgb-k65YMF85D6uIA.aspx|website=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; two years before Bradlee, and lived nearby. In 1960 Bradlee toured with both Kennedy and [[Richard Nixon]] in their presidential campaigns. He later wrote a book, ''Conversations With Kennedy'' (W.W. Norton, 1975), recounting their relationship during those years. Bradlee was, at this point, Washington Bureau chief for ''Newsweek'', a position from which he helped negotiate the sale of the magazine to ''The Washington Post'' holding company. Bradlee maintained that position until being promoted to managing editor at the ''Post'' in 1965. He became executive editor in 1968.

After Bradlee and Pinchot divorced, Bradlee married fellow journalist [[Sally Quinn]] on {{nowrap|October 20}}, 1978.&lt;ref name="nyt2014"/&gt; Quinn and Bradlee had one child, [[Quinn Bradlee]], who was born in 1982 when Quinn was 40 and Bradlee was 60. In 2009 they appeared with Quinn Bradlee on the ''[[Charlie Rose Show]]'' on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and spoke of their son's having been born with Velo-cardio-facial syndrome, also known as [[DiGeorge syndrome]].

Bradlee retired as the executive editor of ''The Washington Post'' in September 1991 but continued to serve as vice president at large until his death.&lt;ref name=nyt2014 /&gt; He was succeeded as executive editor at the ''Post'' by [[Leonard Downie Jr.]], whom Bradlee had appointed as managing editor seven years earlier.
{{Watergate}}
Under Bradlee's leadership, ''The Washington Post'' took on major challenges during the [[Nixon administration]]. In 1971 ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''Post'' successfully challenged the government over the right to publish the [[Pentagon Papers]].&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt; One year later, Bradlee backed reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] as they probed the break-in at the [[Democratic National Committee]] Headquarters in the [[Watergate Hotel]].&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt; According to Bradlee:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You had a lot of Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/woo1int-1 |title=Biography and Video Interview of Ben Bradlee at Academy of Achievement |publisher=Achievement.org |date= |accessdate=May 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512205057/http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/woo1int-1 |archivedate=May 12, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of [[Richard Nixon]] in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]], the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's [[FBI]] associate director [[Mark Felt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=John |last1=Helton |first2=Todd |last2=Leopold |title=Washington Post's Ben Bradlee dies |date=October 22, 2014 |accessdate=October 23, 2014 |website=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/21/us/ben-bradlee-dies/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025052433/http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/21/us/ben-bradlee-dies/ |archivedate=October 25, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 ''Post'' reporter [[Janet Cooke]] won a Pulitzer Prize for "Jimmy's World", a profile of an 8-year-old [[heroin]] addict.

Cooke, meanwhile, was forced to resign and relinquish the Pulitzer.

In recognition of his work as editor of ''The Washington Post'', Bradlee won the [[Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arizona State University|title=Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication|url=https://cronkite.asu.edu/about/walter-cronkite-and-asu/walter-cronkite-award|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Bradlee delivered the [[Theodore H. White]] lecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theodore H. White lecture|url=http://shorensteincenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/th_white_1991_bradlee.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]]. His message:  Lying in Washington, whether in the White House or the Congress, is wrong, immoral, tearing at the fiber of our national instincts and institutions — and must stop. He said, "Lying has reached such epidemic proportions in our culture and among our institutions in recent years,  that we've all become immunized to it."  He went on to suggest that the deceit was degrading the respect for the truth.

In the fall of 2005, [[Jim Lehrer]] conducted six hours of interviews with Bradlee on a variety of topics, from the responsibilities of the press to Watergate to the [[Plame affair|Valerie Plame affair]]. The interviews were edited for an hour-long documentary, ''Free Speech: Jim Lehrer and Ben Bradlee'', which premiered on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] on {{nowrap|June 19}}, 2006.

==Later life and death==
At ''The Washington Post'', Bradlee carried the title vice president at large. He and Quinn lived at the [[Laird-Dunlop House|Todd Lincoln House]] in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown, Washington, D.C]]. The middle part of the house was built in 1792. They also restored [[Porto Bello (Drayden, Maryland)|Porto Bello]], their home in [[Drayden, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ben |last=Brown |title=Porto Bello Restored |date=n.d. |accessdate=March 28, 2011 |website=Southern Accents |url=http://www.southernaccents.com/architecture/preservation/porto-bello-restored-00400000025395/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304212828/http://www.southernaccents.com/architecture/preservation/porto-bello-restored-00400000025395/ |archivedate=March 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradlee received the [[French Legion of Honor]], the highest award given by the French government, at a ceremony in 2007 in Paris.&lt;ref name=Honors/&gt;

Bradlee was named as a recipient of the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Barack Obama]] on {{nowrap|August 8}}, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/08/president-obama-names-presidential-medal-freedom-recipients|title=President Obama Names Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipients|publisher=Office of the Press Secretary, The White House|date=August 8, 2013|accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was presented the medal at a White House ceremony on {{nowrap|November 20}}, 2013.

Bradlee spent his final years suffering with dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quinn|first1=Sally|title=He was behaving differently. He had lost something.

He was buried at the [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Oak Hill Cemetery]] in Washington, D.C. ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' paid tribute to Bradlee by posting his quote, "Today Our Best, Tomorrow Better" on the wall of their office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.instagram.com/p/BbVTyo0gRXt/?hl=en | title =Today Our Best, Tomorrow Better. | date =November 10, 2017 | website =instagram | publisher =John Avlon | access-date =November 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Bradlee has drawn criticism from several quarters{{Clarify|reason="several quarters" is not specific enough, clarity is needed as to who leveled criticism|date=January 2018}} for his perjury at the 1965 trial of the man accused of murdering Bradlee's sister-in-law [[Mary Pinchot Meyer]], who was shot to death on October 12, 1964, while walking on the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal|Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal]] towpath in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]]. Attorneys for both the prosecution and the defense (Alfred Hantman&lt;ref&gt;Janney, ''Mary's Mosaic'', p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dovey Johnson Roundtree|Dovey J. Roundtree]]&lt;ref name="McCabe, Katie 2009, pp. 205-206"&gt;McCabe, Katie, and Roundtree, Dovey Johnson. ''Justice Older Than the Law: The Life of Dovey Johnson Roundtree.'' Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2009, pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt;), in addition to D.C. Police Detective Bernie Crooke,&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum &amp; Nobile, "The Curious Aftermath of JFK's Best and Brightest Affair," p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; along with authors [[Peter Janney]]&lt;ref&gt;Janney, Peter. ''Mary's Mosaic: The CIA Conspiracy to Murder John F. Kennedy, Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Their Vision for World Peace.'' New York: Skyhorse Publishing, 2013, pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nina Burleigh]],&lt;ref&gt;Burleigh, Nina. ''A Very Private Woman - the Life and Unsolved Murder of Presidential Mistress Mary Meyer.'' New York: Bantam Books, 1998, pp. 297–298.&lt;/ref&gt; have all noted the significant difference between the limited information Bradlee divulged under oath at the 1965 trial, and what he revealed 30 years later in his 1995 memoir ''A Good Life''.&lt;ref name="McCabe, Katie 2009, pp. 205-206"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum &amp; Nobile, ''The Curious Aftermath of JFK's Best and Brightest Affair,'' p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinchot Meyer biographers Janney&lt;ref&gt;Janney, ''Mary's Mosaic'', p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt; and Burleigh have both criticized Bradlee's omission of substantial information under oath. "Bradlee had excoriated Cord Meyer [Pinchot Meyer's ex-husband] for his 'derisive scorn' for the people's right to know in the 1960s, but the rules changed when the subject of a story was his sister-in-law," author Burleigh wrote. "The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] champion of the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] investigation admitted in his memoir that he gave Mary Meyer's diary to the CIA because it was 'a family document.'"&lt;ref&gt;Burleigh, ''A Very Private Woman,'' pp. 297–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1995 memoir ''A Good Life'',  Bradlee revealed that his sister-in-law's diary contained information about her affair with the late President Kennedy and the fact that Bradlee had conspired with CIA counterintelligence chief [[James Angleton]] and others to destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;Bradlee, Ben., ''A Good Life – Newspapering and Other Adventures.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster,  1995. pp. 267–268.&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1965 trial, however, he failed to mention the diary when asked under oath what he had found when searching her studio on the night of the murder.&lt;ref&gt;United States District Court for the District of Columbia: ''United States of America vs. Ray Crump, Jr.'' Criminal Case No. 930-64. Washington, D.C., July 20, 1965, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1991 interview with the late author Leo Damore, prosecuting attorney Hantman said that having knowledge of the diary at the trial "could have changed everything."&lt;ref&gt;Janney, Mary's Mosaic, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2009 autobiography, ''Justice Older than the Law'', defense counsel Dovey Johnson Roundtree expresses shock at learning of the diary's significance from Bradlee's book, and states,

&lt;blockquote&gt;James Angleton's awareness of the diary's existence and his interest in finding it, reading it, and destroying it – all of that unsettled me deeply when I read Mr. Bradlee's 1995 account, as did his insistence that the diary was a private document ... Had I been aware of it, I would have felt compelled to pursue it.&lt;ref name="McCabe, Katie 2009, pp. 205-206"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Volunteer service==
For many years Bradlee served on the board of trustees of [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]].&lt;ref name="investPower"/&gt; He was very active on the board and also played major roles in the establishment of the [[Center for the Study of Democracy (St. Mary's College of Maryland)|Center for the Study of Democracy]] at the college, where he also served on the advisory board.

He is also known for his work on the board of trustees of the [[St. Mary's City, Maryland|Historic St. Mary's City]] Commission, as well as narrating a documentary produced by the organization on the history of the early [[Province of Maryland|Maryland colony]].

{{Portal|Gemology and Jewelry}}

==History==
[[Image:Frédéric Boucheron00.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Frédéric Boucheron&lt;/center&gt;]]

===At the origins===
The House of Boucheron is a French family dynasty founded by Frederic Boucheron in 1858, with the opening of his first store in the Galerie de Valois, at [[Palais-Royal]], during the heyday of the [[Second French Empire]]. He created his atelier in 1866 and a year later won the Gold Medal during the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)]].

In 1893, Frédéric Boucheron became the first [[jeweller]] to move to [[Place Vendôme]]. Legend has it that he chose 26 [[Place Vendôme]], where Boucheron remains to this day, because it was the sunniest corner of the square.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} He believed that the [[diamonds]] in the windows would sparkle all the more brilliantly.

In 1893, Boucheron opened a store in Moscow, later transferred to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1911. In 1903 a store in London and an office in New York. More store openings followed in [[Japan]] in 1973, [[Shanghai]], [[Dubai]] in 2005, and finally [[Hong Kong]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]] in 2006.

Boucheron was a family business; after the death of its founder Frédéric Boucheron in 1902, his descendants took over the business.
In 1994, the family business shifted to a more global approach with its selling out to Schweizerhall.

The House of Boucheron was then acquired by former [[Gucci]] Group in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professionaljeweler.com/archives/news/2000/052400story.html |title=Gucci Buys Boucheron |publisher=Professionaljeweler.com |date=2000-05-24 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was bought by [[PPR (company)|PPR]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Finance |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2881950/Confident-Gucci-holds-attraction-for-PPR.html |title=Confident Gucci holds attraction for PPR |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Bouissou was appointed CEO in April 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bishop |first=Kathryn |url=http://www.professionaljeweller.com/article-9456-new-president-and-ceo-appointed-at-boucheron/ |title=New president and CEO appointed at Boucheron |publisher=ProfessionalJeweller.com |date=2011-05-26 |accessdate=2012-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822220103/http://www.professionaljeweller.com/article-9456-new-president-and-ceo-appointed-at-boucheron/ |archivedate=2012-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by Helene Poulit-Duquesne in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonydemarco/2015/07/09/cartier-executive-named-ceo-of-boucheron/ |title=Cartier Executive Named CEO Of Boucheron |publisher=forbes.com |date=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The royal years===
In 1878, the Russian Prince Felix Youssoupoff purchased a corsage decorated with 6 detachable diamond bows during one of his visits to [[Paris]].

In 1921, Boucheron was commissioned to make a tiara for Lady Greville which was later given to [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orderofsplendor.blogspot.com/2011/09/tiara-thursday-boucheron-honeycomb.html |title=The Royal Order of Sartorial Splendor: Tiara Thursday: The Boucheron Honeycomb Tiara |publisher=Orderofsplendor.blogspot.com |date=2011-09-08 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandson [[Prince Charles]] passed the tiara on to his wife [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madhattery.royalroundup.com/2009/10/state-banquet-hrh-the-duchess-of-cornwall/ |title=Mad Hattery! » Blog Archive » State Banquet: HRH The Duchess of Cornwall |publisher=Madhattery.royalroundup.com |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Queen Elizabeth II]] also has a collection of Boucheron jewels.

In 1928, the [[Maharaja of Patiala]] asked Boucheron to set the stones of his treasure, which were brought to the [[Place Vendôme]] boutique by the prince.

In addition to [[Czar Alexander III]], royal patrons of Boucheron have included [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Maharajah Sir Bhupinder Singh of Patiala]], [[Riza Shah Pahlevi]], [[Farida of Egypt|Queen Farida of Egypt]] and [[Queen Rania of Jordan]].

===Collections===
One of the first lines created was the symbolic snake line in the 1970s.

[[Solange Azagury-Partridge]] was appointed Creative Director in 2001, she held the position for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Harriet|title=Queen of the stone age: Solange Azagury-Partridge has never been too precious to go her own way|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/queen-of-the-stone-age-solange-azagurypartridge-has-never-been-too-precious-to-go-her-own-way-7678854.html?origin=internalSearch|accessdate=23 September 2012|newspaper=Independent, The|date=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  2002 saw the launch of the "Beauté Dangereuse" and "Cinna Pampilles" collections, "Not Bourgeois" launched the following year.

In 2004, the "Jaipur" High Jewellery line and the "Déchaînée" collection are launched.

2005 is a very creative year for the House of Boucheron : the "Trouble", "Quatre", "Diablotine", "Vingt-Six" and "Trouble Désir" jewellery lines are launched.

In 2006 "Exquises Confidences" is launched, and a year later "Fleurs Fatales" high jewellery collection makes its debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paris-joaillerie.com/paris-joaillerie/collection/un-florilege-de-sortileges-selon-boucheron.html |title=Collections - Un florilège de sortilèges selon Boucheron |publisher=Paris-joaillerie.com |date=2007-12-02 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Boucheron unveiled a colorful jewellery range to enhance its "Cinna Pampilles" collection.

In 2011, the "Cabinet of Curiosities" line was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lucire.com/2011/0207fe0.shtml |title=Lucire Fashion: A cabinet of curiosities – The global fashion magazine |publisher=Lucire.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborations===
In 1996 Boucheron collaborated with Waterman Paris to produce the limited edition, ''Edson signe Boucheron''. The nib was made of 18K solid gold with the body of the pen being of a blue translucent Resin. The retail price was €2000 / $2700 / £1700 and limited to only 3471 pieces (this number is the sum of the years of foundation of Waterman, 1883, and Boucheron, 1858). The pen remains one of the most sought after pieces within the fine writing category.

In 2006, Boucheron and [[Alexander McQueen]] collaborated to create a limited-edition Novak bag that incorporates the snake motif of Boucheron's Trouble line.

The beginning of a collaboration between Boucheron and Swiss watchmaker [[Girard-Perregaux]] started a year later in 2007, amongst which feature the LadyHawk Tourbillon and the limited Boucheron tribute watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luxury-insider.com/luxury-news/2010/10/girard-perregaux-limited-edition-boucheron-tribute |title=Girard-Perregaux Limited Edition Boucheron Tribute - Luxury News from |publisher=Luxury Insider |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==

Boucheron makes watches, and jewellery, and licenses its marque for perfumes. The watch and jewelry making segments have existed for over 150 years. The first fragrance, "Boucheron," was launched in 1988. Over 22 men's and women's fragrances have been released. Since 2011 Boucheron fragrances have been created, produced and distributed under license by [[:fr:Interparfums|Interparfums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boucheron and Interparfums sign 15-year exclusive license agreement for fragrances|url=http://uk.fashionmag.com/news/Boucheron-and-Inter-Parfums-sign-15-year-exclusive-license-agreement-for-fragrances,141780.html|publisher=FashionMag.com|accessdate=23 September 2012|date=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boucheron International Rating of Diamonds==
Boucheron has compiled a classification system by which to determine the value of a diamond, developed on the basis of the diamond's international currency. The Boucheron method of appreciation has been registered under the name B.I.R.D. (Boucheron International Rating of [[Diamonds]]). This original classification system is based on an evaluation of diamond quality and relies on a combined analysis of two criteria: first, the degree of clarity and second, the colour of the stone. The point at which these two variables, "clarity" and "colour" intersect gives rise to a mark of appreciation of between 90/100 and 99/100 for the quality of the diamond. A mark of 100/100 would indicate that a stone possesses the ultimate degree of perfection, according to Boucheron's criteria.

==Vertu mobile phone==
In a joint venture with the mobile phone brand Vertu, Boucheron created the world's first High Jewellery limited edition cell phones out of gold and precious stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woollard |first=Deidre |url=http://www.luxist.com/2006/10/07/boucheron-for-vertu-phones/ |title=Boucheron for Vertu Phones |publisher=Luxist.com |date=2006-10-07 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collaboration continued with the 150th anniversary celebration with a new line of 7 Vertu mobile phones inspired by Boucheron's High Jewellery "Enchanting Boucheron" anniversary collection. There are only eight pieces of the Cobra model in rose gold set all round with rubies and a pear-cut diamond and emerald eyes. Entwined around a rose gold case, the Python model, a serpent set with multi-coloured sapphires, diamonds and two sapphires, will be brought out in 26 pieces, as a reference to the famous jeweller's address, 26 place Vendôme.

==Retail==
The distribution network of Boucheron is made of 34 shops located all over the world (Paris, [[Cannes]], [[Saint-Tropez]], [[Monaco]], Beirut, London, San Francisco, Tokyo, [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama]], [[Yokohama]], [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]], [[Kyoto]], [[Osaka]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Okayama]], [[Nagoya]], [[Taipei]], [[Seoul]], [[Shanghai]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Dubai]], [[Baku]], Moscow, [[Toronto]], [[Almaty]], and [[Kuwait]]) and over 100 certified retailers.

'''Central Saint Petersburg''' is the central and the leading part of [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. It looks nothing like the [[downtown]] district of a typical major city, and has no [[skyscrapers]]. The [[Central Business District]]'s main borders are [[Neva River]] to the north and west, and the [[Fontanka River]] to the south and east, but the downtown includes areas outside.

==History==
The Central Saint Petersburg is the oldest part of the city after the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]]. When people were starting to populate Saint Petersburg they built their houses around the almost only building outside the fortress; the [[Admiralty building, Saint Petersburg|Admiralty building]]. The largest industry was ship building. The first residence of [[Peter the Great]] was a little [[Cabin of Peter the Great|hut]] (the hut hasn't been destroyed and is a museum), but he soon started to build the [[Summer Palace (Saint Petersburg)|Summer Palace]], which was located just opposite the hut, on the other side of the Neva River, and later he built a [[Winter Palace]] for himself. The central part of the city was supposed to be between the Peter and Paul Fortress and his first house.

==Overview==
The CBS is an area with many old buildings and has beautiful parks like the [[Summer Garden]], [[Field of Mars (Saint Petersburg)|Field of Mars]] and [[Mikhailovsky Garden]]. It is also the wealthiest area in Saint Petersburg, home to luxury hotels like [[Hotel Astoria (Saint Petersburg)|Hotel Astoria]] and [[Grand Hotel Europe]]. It has always been a wealthy district since the rich noble Russians built their mansions here.

Administratively, the Saint Petersburg central business district falls under the authority of [[Tsentralny District, Saint Petersburg|Tsentralny]] and the [[Admiralteysky District]]s.

The CBS is also a main traffic hub, with [[tram]]ways, [[trolleybus]]es, [[bus]]es, [[marshrutka]]s, and the [[Moskovsky Rail Terminal (Saint Petersburg)|Moscow Rail Terminal]].

==Streets and squares==
Significant streets are [[Nevsky Prospekt]], the heart of the city, and is one of the largest shopping streets in [[Europe]], with department stores like [[Great Gostiny Dvor|Gostiny Dvor]] and [[Passage (department store)|The Passage]]. It's also home to the [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]] and [[Anichkov Palace]].

[[Sadovaya Street]] is a main street in downtown with high traffic, home to [[Moika Palace|Yusupov Palace]], [[Apraksin Dvor]] department store, and crossing the [[Sennaya Square]]; a main square, with entertainment, commercial and many shops.

[[St Isaac's Square]] is home to the [[St Isaac's Cathedral]] and [[Mariinsky Palace]], and has a monument dedicated to tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]].
On the other side of the cathedral is the [[Decembrists Square]], next to the Admiralty building, and the location of the ''[[Bronze Horseman]]''.

[[Palace Square]] is home to the [[Winter Palace]] and the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]].

[[Arts Square]] is home to the [[Russian Museum]], the [[Mikhaylovsky Theatre]], the Large Concert Hall (Bolshoi Zal) of the [[Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra|St. Petersburg Philarmonic]], the [[Pushkin]] monument and is not far from the [[Church of the Savior on Blood]].

The Theatre Square is home to the world famous [[Mariinsky Theatre]].

'''Centro''' is the central [[Districts of Madrid|district]] of the city of [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. It is approximately 5.23 km² (2.02 sq mi) in size. It has a population of 149,718 people and a population density of 28,587/km² (74,040/sq mi).

==History==
{{see also|History of Madrid}}
The Centro district of Madrid is the oldest section of the city. Evidence of a stable settlement dates back to Spain's Muslim period. In the second half of the 9th century, the emir of [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]], [[Muhammad I of Córdoba|Muhammad I]] (852–886), built a fortress on a promontory beside the river, the modern-day location of the [[Royal Palace of Madrid|Royal Palace]]. Its purpose was to watch the passes of the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] and to initiate raids against the northern Christian countries. The remaining ruins of the fortress's wall are still preserved. A small suburb called Magerit developed to the east of the fortress. With the exception of the wall, few structures from this period remain.

The city passed into Christian hands in 1085, prospering into a villa by 1123. [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] chose to place his court in Madrid in 1561, ensuring the swift evolution of the city. Many of the older buildings and monuments of the region known as [[El Madrid de los Austrias]] are from this period.

The city quickly surpassed the borders of the current Centro district; however, the majority of new monuments continue to be built in the area, including the Royal Palace and the [[Plaza de Cibeles]]. The [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] kings, especially Carlos III, fixated on converting Madrid into a city at the height of the new European villas, using Paris as a model. This resulted in huge investments in the infrastructure of the city, especially sewage and public buildings.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, with the arrival of democracy, the city continued to grow. The reign of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] saw the construction of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]] building, in [[Puerta del Sol]].

Centro currently houses the central government of the [[Community of Madrid]], in Puerta del Sol. Until 2007, the City Council of Madrid was also located here, in Plaza de la Villa. At present it is located in [[Cybele Palace]], in the district of Retiro.

==Neighborhoods==
The district is divided into several historic neighborhoods (''barrios''), including: 

*[[El Madrid de los Austrias|Los Austrias]]
*Barrio de las letras
*[[Chueca]]
*Conde Duque
*[[Barrio de La Latina (Madrid)|La Latina]]
*[[Lavapiés]]
*[[Malasaña]]
*Salesas

==Administrative wards==
[[image:Barrios del Distrito Centro (Madrid).svg|thumb|Division of administrative wards in the Centro district]]
Administratively, the district is divided into 6 wards (also called barrios):
*[[Cortes (Madrid)|Cortes]]
*[[Embajadores]]
*[[Justicia (Madrid)|Justicia]]
*[[Universidad (Madrid)|Universidad]]
*[[Palacio (Madrid)|Palacio]]
*[[Sol (Madrid)|Sol]]

'''Chester Irving Barnard''' (November 7, 1886 – June 7, 1961) was an [[United States|American]] business [[Senior management|executive]], public administrator, and the author of pioneering work in [[management]] theory and [[organizational studies]]. His landmark 1938 book, ''[[The Functions of the Executive]]'', sets out a [[organization theory|theory of organization]] and of the functions of executives in organizations. The book has been widely assigned in university courses in [[management]] theory and [[industrial sociology|organizational sociology]].&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;[http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9199394 Chester (Irving) Barnard Biography (1886 - 1961)]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} on biography.com. Retrieved 16 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard viewed organizations as systems of cooperation of human activity, and noted that they are typically short-lived. According to Barnard, organizations are generally not long-lived because they do not meet the two criteria necessary for survival: [[effectiveness]] and [[efficiency]].

== Biography ==
In his youth, Barnard worked on a farm, then studied economics at [[Harvard University]], earning money selling pianos and operating a dance band. He did not obtain his Harvard BA because he did his four-year work in three years and could not complete a science course, but a number of universities later granted him honorary doctorates.&lt;ref name = "RCST"&gt;R.C.S. Trahair (1994) "Barnard's executive functions" in ''From Aristotelian to Reaganomics''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnard joined the [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (now AT&amp;T) in 1909. In 1927, he became president of the [[New Jersey Bell Telephone Company]]. During the [[Great Depression]], he directed the New Jersey state relief system.&lt;ref name = "Bio"/&gt;

He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1939.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was president of the [[United Service Organizations]] (USO), 1942-45. Upon retiring from business, he served as president of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], 1948–52, and as chairman of the [[National Science Foundation]], 1952-54.&lt;ref name = "Bio"/&gt; End 1950s he was among the first members of the [[Society for General Systems Research]].

== Work ==
Barnard viewed organizations as systems of cooperation of human activity, and noted that they are typically short-lived. It is rare for a firm to last more than a century. Similarly most nations last for less than a century. The only organization that can claim a substantial age is the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. According to Barnard, organizations are not long-lived because they do not meet the two criteria necessary for survival: [[effectiveness]] and [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]]. Effectiveness, is defined the usual way: as being able to accomplish stated goals. In contrast, Barnard's meaning of organizational efficiency differed substantially from the conventional use of the word. He defined efficiency of an organization as the degree to which that organization is able to satisfy the [[Motivation|motives]] of the individuals. If an organization satisfies the motives of its members while attaining its explicit goals, cooperation among its members will last.

Barnard was a great admirer of [[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979) and he and Parsons corresponded persistently. The two scholars would send manuscripts for commentary to each other and they would write long letters where they engage in a common theoretical discussion. The first correspondence between Barnard and Parsons began in the end of the 1930s and it persisted essentially to Barnard’s death in 1961.

=== The Functions of the Executive ===
{{Main|The Functions of the Executive}}
Barnard's classic 1938 book, ''The Functions of the Executive'' discusses, as the title suggests, the functions of the executive, but not from a merely intuitive point of view, but instead deriving them from his conception of cooperative systems.

Barnard summarized the functions of the executive as follows: 
* Establishing and maintaining a system of communication;
* Securing essential services from other members;
* Formulating organizational purposes and objectives.
* To manage people and make sure they do their jobs

=== Authority and incentives ===
Barnard formulated two interesting theories: one of [[authority]] and the other of [[incentives]]. Both are seen in the context of a [[communication system]] grounded in seven essential rules: 
* The channels of communication should be definite;
* Everyone should know of the channels of communication;
* Everyone should have access to the formal channels of communication;
* Lines of communication should be as short and as direct as possible;
* Competence of persons serving as communication centers should be adequate;
* The line of communication should not be interrupted when the organization is functioning;
* Every communication should be authenticated.

Thus, what makes a communication [[authoritative]], rests with the subordinate, rather than with his superior. Barnard's perspective had affinities to that of [[Mary Parker Follett]] and was very unusual for his time, and that has remained the case down to the present day. He seemed to argue that managers should obtain authority by treating subordinates with respect and competence.

As for incentives, he proposed two ways of convincing subordinates to cooperate: tangible incentives and [[persuasion]]. Barnard gives great importance to persuasion, much more than to economic incentives. He described four general, and four specific incentives. 
The specific incentives were:
# Money and other material inducements;
# Personal non-material opportunities for distinction;
# Desirable physical conditions of work;
# Ideal benefactions, such as [[pride of workmanship]] etc.

The general incentives were:
# Associated attractiveness (based upon compatibility with associates)
# Adaptation of working conditions to habitual methods and attitudes
# The opportunity for the feeling of enlarged participation in the course of events
# The condition of communing with others (personal comfort with social relations, opportunity for comradeship etc., )

In general, the term '''credit''' in the artistic or intellectual sense refers to an acknowledgement of those who contributed to a work, whether through ideas or in a more direct sense.

==Credit in the arts==
In the creative [[arts]], credits are an acknowledgement of those who participated in the production. They are often shown at the end of movies and on CD jackets. In [[film]], [[video]], [[television]], [[theater]], etc., ''credits'' means the list of [[actor]]s and behind-the-scenes staff who contributed to the production.
{{seealso|Motion picture credits}}
===Non-fiction===
In [[non-fiction]] writing, especially academic works, it is generally considered important to give credit to sources of information and ideas. Failure to do so often gives rise to charges of [[plagiarism]], and "piracy" of [[intellectual rights]] such as the right to receive a [[copyright|royalty]] for having written.  In this sense the financial and [[individual capital|individual]] meanings are linked.

Academic papers generally contain a lengthy section of footnotes or [[scientific citation|citations]].  Such detailed crediting of sources provides readers with an opportunity to discover more about the cited material. It also provides a check against misquotation, as it's easy for an attributed quote to be checked when the reference is available.  All of this is thought to improve [[integrity]] of the [[instructional capital]] conveyed, which may be quite fragile, and easy to misinterpret or to misapply.

===In fiction===
In [[fiction]] writing, authors are generally expected to give credit to those who contributed significantly to a work. Sometimes authors who do not want credit for their work directly may choose to use a [[pen name]]. A [[ghostwriter]] gives all or some of the credit for his or her writing to someone else.

==In computing==
In [[computer software]] [[software license|licenses]], attribution of credit is sometimes a condition of licensing. For example, original versions of the [[BSD license]] controversially required credit to be provided in the advertisement for software that used licensed code, but only if features or use of the licensed software was mentioned in the advertisement.

[[Software documentation]] is sometimes licensed under similar terms. For example, the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL) used by [[Wikipedia]] requires that acknowledgments to authors be preserved.

A '''customer benefit package (CBP)''' forms part of the [[operations management]] (OM) toolkit. It involves a clearly defined set of tangible (goods) and intangible (services) features that the customer recognizes, purchase or use. This can be the real or perceived value that a customer experiences or believes they are receiving through dealing with a company.

==Overview==
A combination of a primary product with additional goods and services defines the total product to the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Managing for Quality and Performance Excellence|last=Lindsay|first=James R.|last2=Evans|first2=William M.|publisher=South-Western Cengage Learning|year=|isbn=0324783221|edition=Eighth|location=Mason, OH|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a CBP is a combination of services and goods that adds value to the primary product acquired by the customer. The primary product is the “core” offering that attracts customers and satisfy their basic needs. These goods and services adding value to the primary product are called peripheral goods and services, which are not essential to the primary product, but enhance it. Examples of peripheral goods and services in the fast food industry include toys (peripheral goods) that are offered as part of a kiddie’s meal and a kids' play area (peripheral service) inside the fast food restaurant.

The CBP may also contain some variants as part of the product offering. A variant is an attribute that departs from the CBP overall theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=OM3|last=Evans|first=David A.|last2=Collier|first2=James R.|publisher=South-Western Cengage Learning|year=2009|isbn=0538479132|edition=Student|location=Mason, OH|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding unique goods or services like free Internet access inside the fast food restaurant gives the customer the ability to surf the Internet while enjoying a meal. Often a variant will become part of the CBP on a continuous basis, thus it becomes a permanent peripheral good or service.
[[File:Customer Benefit Package.png|upright|frame|right|alt=A graph describing a customer benefit package in fast food; examples include kids parties, a peripheral service, kids toys, a peripheral good, and free Internet access, a variant which may eventually become a permanent peripheral service.|Customer benefit package]]

== Benefits of a CBP ==
* Defines the services or products offering to the customer.
* Serves as guidelines for employees when selling the product.
* Provides a marketing and communication channel to reach the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Consumer-Driven Demand and Operations Management Models: A Systematic Study of Information-Technology-Enabled Sales Mechanisms|last=|first=|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=0387980180|editor-last=Netessine|editor-first=Serguei|location=New York, NY|pages=|editor-last2=Tang|editor-first2=Christopher S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CBP integration as part of OM ==
The CBP cannot stand on its own as a system or tool. OM requires effective management of the whole value chain starting with identifying the customer’s needs and ending with supplying a final product that meets or exceeds the customer’s expectations. Developing the CBP through all these stages of the value chain is essential to create and deliver a process for each peripheral good or service adding to the overall development of the final product to the customer.

== More example CBPs ==
===Automobile industry ===
The requirements of the customer (client) are clearly defined within a contract agreement between the contractor and the customer. However, there are a number of peripheral good and services that can be developed in this highly controlled environment. Disciples like quality management and risk management in conjunction with information technology (IT) systems and operations management (OM) processes can be used to develop systems with the ability to capture real-time data and report directly to the customer. This is just one example of many more possibilities that can differentiate a contractor from the competition.

=== Medical ===
Medicine is evolving daily; there are new cures to diseases, new vaccines and new diagnostic technology that once thought impossible. "There is however an extreme lack in incorporating information technology (IT) and OM processes within medical practices. I have therefore decided to re-evaluate the value chain within my new general practitioner (GP) practice", a South African doctor comments. Living in the information age, patients want to know everything, so much a new term "googlelitis" is used in describing many patients. Embracing this new culture (need) amongst patients can be satisfied with the use of short message service (SMS) technology to report medical results and confirm future appointments.

The '''Djibouti Ports &amp; Free Zones Authority''' (DPFZA) is the governmental body of [[Djibouti]] that administers and manages the [[Port of Djibouti]] and several other facilities in the country. 
The DPFZA also oversees the management of [[Djibouti International Free Trade Zone]], serving as a liaison between the companies based there and other governmental agencies. 
The DPFZA reports directly to the Presidential Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti Ports &amp; Free Zones Authority|url=http://dpfza.gov.dj|publisher=DPFZA|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Djibouti Ports &amp; Free Zones Authority is the governing authority that sets the rules, directives and overarching principles for ports and free zones in Djibouti.  
The mandate of the DPFZA is: 
* Promote Djibouti’s ports and free zones
* Establishment of a business friendly environment with a business oriented legal framework 
* Regulate Djibouti’s ports through the Board of Directors.
* Develop new ports and free zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=103/AN/05/5eme L ON FREE ZONE COMPANIES L'Assem|url=http://www.djibouti-portsfz.dj/sites/default/files/FZ.Law_.103.English.pdf|publisher=DPFZA|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Construction begins on Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ)|url=http://www.zawya.com/story/Construction_begins_on_Djibouti_International_Free_Trade_Zone_DIFTZ-ZAWYA20170118131616/|publisher=Thomson Reuters Zawya|accessdate=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Development==
[[Djibouti]]’s location, linking the [[Suez Canal]], the [[Gulf of Aden]] and the inland countries of the [[Horn of Africa]] led to increased port and shipping activity in the region. The [[World Bank]] estimates that [[Djibouti]] will maintain a 7% rate of growth in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti’s Economic Outlook- April 2017|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/djibouti/publication/economic-outlook-april-2017|publisher=The World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; This economic outlook is strengthened by large-scale investment in construction and infrastructure in [[Djibouti]] and the wider [[East Africa]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti – unlocking Africa’s economic potential|url=http://www.cnbcafrica.com/news/western-africa/2016/06/08/djibouti-economic-growth-africa/|publisher=CNBC Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Map Of Djibouti City and Balbala.png|thumb|left|Map districts of Djibouti City and Balbala.]]
The Djibouti Ports &amp; Free Zones Authority contributes to and leads several of these projects. The DPFZA’s highly trained staff coordinate with government agencies and international partners to focus [[Djibouti]]’s strategic development, support the flow of capital investment, and manage the construction railways, airports and power plants. Fast-paced growth has led to an increase in competition and a diversification of consumer markets, which is transforming the economy in the long-term. In turn, financial institutions, such as the Central Bank of Djibouti (Banque Centrale de Djibouti, BCD) is working with its partners to develop new regulation, frameworks and technological solutions to support growth, manage risk and promote increased corporate and financial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China-built rail network in African heartland inaugurated|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/china-built-rail-network-african-heartland-inaugurated-1600444|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti, a safe harbour in the troubled Horn of Africa|url=http://www.thenational.ae/world/africa/djibouti-a-safe-harbour-in-the-troubled-horn-of-africa|publisher=TheNational World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Report: Djibouti 2016|url=https://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/djibouti-2016/banking-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chairman of the DPFZA==
Aboubaker Omar Hadi has served as the Chairman of the Djibouti Ports &amp; Free Zones Authority (DPFZA) since July 2, 2011. His career has spanned over 30 years, beginning in the Port of Djibouti where he worked in the Marine Department and Port Control and was responsible for port documentation in 1978. Throughout his career, he has also served as Deputy Manager in the statistics department, General Cargo Manager, Container Terminal Manager and Commercial Director of the port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti Appoints New Chair to Port, Freezone Authorities|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201107141309.html|publisher=allAfrica|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aboubaker Omar Hadi has been instrumental in improving trade relations between Djibouti and Ethiopia, to the extent where the neighbouring country now uses Djibouti’s ports for over 90% of its foreign trade. 
More recently he has led the expansion of Djibouti’s ports and free zones as the nation strives to become the commercial trade hub of East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aboubaker Hadi|url=http://www.businessforafricaforum.com/speaker/aboubaker-hadi/|publisher=Business For Africa Forum|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aboubaker Omar Hadi completed his First Degree in Ports and Multimodal Transport from Le Conservatoire Nationale des Arts et Metiers, in France, and also holds a master's degree in Ports and Shipping Administration from the World Maritime University of Sweden.

==Projects==
The Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority (DPFZA) engages in projects with renowned global partners to strengthen [[Djibouti]]’s role as a logistics and infrastructure hub. 
Its strategic position grants vessels and cargo direct access to strategic passages, such as the [[Suez Canal]]. Its proximity to developing landlocked economies such as [[Ethiopia]] provides opportunities for bilateral and multi-lateral cooperation. In fact, Djibouti-Ethiopia relations has been praised as a model of regional integration. 
[[Djibouti]] launched a $15 billion expansion program, which includes the development of airports, highways, and other key national infrastructure projects. In support of this growth, commercial institutions like the [[Djibouti International Free Trade Zone]] and the [[Silk Road International Bank]] have been set up to modernize existing services, and facilitate the development of these projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Air Djibouti takes delivery of first aircraft for new commercial operations|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/968076/economy|publisher=Arab News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silk Road International Bank opens first Africa office in Djibouti|url=http://capitalethiopia.com/2017/01/09/silk-road-international-bank-opens-first-africa-office-djibouti/#.WJx-dm-LS70|publisher=Capital Ethipia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese-funded Silkroad Int'l Bank opens in Djibouti|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-01/18/c_135994459.htm|publisher=New China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway===
[[File:Map of Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway.png|thumb|right|The map of Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway]]
The [[Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway]] is a standard gauge international railway that links Addis Ababa with the port of Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden, providing landlocked Ethiopia with railroad access to the sea. More than 95% of Ethiopia's trade passes through [[Djibouti]]. 
[[China Railway Group]] and the [[China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation]] started construction on the railway in 2011, and were financed by the [[Exim Bank of China]], the [[China Development Bank]], and the [[Industrial and Commercial Bank of China]]. The project was completed in 2016, with a total investment of $4 billion, making the electrified train a key element of the [[Belt and Road Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti-Ethiopia railway carries hope for pan-African trade|url=https://www.ft.com/content/42d7af2e-d95a-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Free Trade Zone==
The Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ) will transform trade in the region and provide a strategic base for global businesses to access the rapidly growing African market. Construction of DIFTZ began a week after the completion of the [[Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway]], a new 752&amp;nbsp;km track linking [[Ethiopia]]’s capital with the [[Port of Djibouti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti breaks ground on massive Chinese-backed free trade zone|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/china-djibouti-idUSL4N1F649H|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Djibouti Ports &amp; Free Zones Authority partnered with [[China Merchants Group]], [[Dalian Port Authority]] and IZP to form the DIFTZ Project Preparatory Group. Together, they began the construction on the $3.5 billion dollar [[free trade zone]], which extends over 4,800 hectares. 
The initiative is expected to create 200,000 new jobs, and cement [[Djibouti]]’s role as the strategic link between global maritime trade routes in the [[Belt and Road Initiative]].

==Ports and Facilities==
In coordination with Djibouti’s government agencies, the DPFZA oversees the construction, management and administration of several ports and facilities.

===Port of Djibouti===
The [[Port of Djibouti]] – also known as the Red Sea Port – facilitates the transit of around 30,000 vessels every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti faces new kid on the block|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36537044|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Djibouti Ports &amp; Free Zones Authority supports the port’s activities by linking it to the [[Port of Doraleh|Doraleh Multipurpose Port]], [[Liquefied natural gas|Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)]] and oil terminal, and two additional ports dedicated to Salt and Potash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Port de Djibouti|url=http://www.portdedjibouti.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti-based Red Sea Bunkering (RSB) acquires new vessel to provide offshore services|url=http://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/djibouti-based-red-sea-bunkering-rsb-acquires-new-vessel-to-provide-offshore-services/|publisher=Hellenic Shipping News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horizon Terminal (HDTL)===
The Horizon Djibouti Terminal is equipped to meet the demands of petroleum trade and shipping, with a storage capacity of 371,000 cubic meters, loading bays and equipment capable of fulfilling local, regional and contango (Trading) needs. 
The Horizon Djibouti Terminal was constructed in response to rapid economic developments in East Africa - such as the spread of independent oil companies and increased logistical activities. 
The HDTL’s facilities are expected to evolve with the changing landscape of maritime shipping of petroleum, and adapt to offer services that meet the traditional and unpredictable demands of Africa’s natural resource sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Horizon Terminals|url=http://www.horizon-terminals.com/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Double linking''' is an organizing principle developed by [[Gerard Endenburg]], a Dutch engineer, as part of the so-called [[sociocracy|sociocratic circular method]]. It operates as an extension of [[Rensis Likert]]'s (single) [[Linking pin model|linking pin]]. In the sociocratic approach, decision-making is structured in circles. Each circle is connected to the next higher circle by way of the functional leader (appointed in the next higher circle) and a representative chosen in the circle. Both the functional leader and the representative participate in policy decisions taken in the lower as well as higher circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles and Practices of Sociocracy|url=http://www.sociocracy.info/about-sociocracy/principles-and-practices-of-sociocracy/|publisher=Sociocracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Romme, A.G.L. (1996). "Making organizational learning work: consent and double linking between circles." European Management Journal, 14(1), 69-75.  doi:10.1016/0263-2373(95)00048-8&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5359">An '''earnings call''' is a [[teleconference]], or [[webcast]], in which a [[public company]] discusses the financial results of a reporting period. The name comes from [[earnings per share]] (EPS), the bottom line number in the [[income statement]] divided by the number of shares outstanding.  The US-based [[National Investor Relations Institute]] (NIRI) says that 92% of companies represented by their members conduct earnings calls and that virtually all of these are webcast.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}  Transcripts of calls may be made available either by the company or a third party.

The calls are usually preceded or accompanied by a [[press release]] containing a summary of the financial results, and possibly by a more detailed filing under securities law.  Earnings calls usually happen, or at least begin, while the [[stock market]] on which the company's shares are traded is closed to trading, so that all investors will have had a chance to hear management's presentation before trading in the stock resumes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
  
==Description==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
Generally, the call will begin with a company official, typically the [[Investor relations|Investor Relations Officer]] (IRO), reading a [[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] statement to limit the company's liability should actual results prove different from expected indicators reported in the discussion.  Then one or more company officials, often including the [[Chief executive officer]] and [[Chief financial officer]], will discuss the operational results and financial statements for the period just ended and their outlook for the future.  The teleconference will then be opened for questions by investors, [[financial analysts]], and other call participants.  Management will answer many of these questions, although if the data is unavailable to them they may decline or defer response.  Depending on the size and complexity of the company, the difference between actual and expected results, and other factors, the length of the call will vary.

There is no general requirement for how far in advance notice of a call must be given.  However, keeping the investor and analyst communities happy is part of management's job, so the call will generally be announced a few days or weeks in advance.  If the company has a website, then there will probably be a section titled ''Investor Relations'' or ''Investors'', where call schedules and archived past calls will typically be posted.

Many companies are tracked by financial analysts that publish estimates of earnings per share (EPS).  The company may also provide [[Guidance (finance)|financial guidance]] as to what EPS are likely to be.  If management knows that its results are going to be significantly different from its guidance or from analyst expectations, it may choose to make a [[preannouncement]] of differing results.

In 2013, the National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI) published ''Standards of Practice: Earnings Release Content'', available to NIRI members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=National Investor Relations Institute Standards of Practice: Earnings Release Content (2013).|url=https://www.niri.org/resources/publications/standards-of-practice-for-investor-relations/standards-of-practice-earnings-release-content-2|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
If the call occurs within 48 hours of a press release filed with the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) on [[Form 8-K]] and meets certain other criteria, there is no obligation to separately report the call to the SEC.  Otherwise, it must be reported on Form 8-K.  If the call contains non-[[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP) information, then there are additional requirements under SEC regulations, including [[Regulation FD]].

Companies headquartered in the United States with securities traded on a US-based stock market or other exchange are required to file audited annual reports with the SEC on [[Form 10-K]] following the end of a [[fiscal year]] and unaudited reports on [[Form 10-Q]] following the end of a fiscal quarter.  These companies announce earnings and generally hold an earnings call quarterly.

Some companies with shares traded on foreign [[stock exchanges]] also have [[American Depositary Receipt]]s (ADRs) that are traded on US stock exchanges and are required to file Forms [[Form 20-F|20-F]] and [[Form 6K|6K]] with the SEC. They are likely to have their earnings announcements and calls coordinated with the schedule required in the country where their shares are traded.

'''''European Closing Bell''''' (prior to June 2003 known as '''''European Market Wrap''''' ) was a [[television programme]] aired on [[business]] [[news]] [[television station|channel]] [[CNBC Europe]] from 5pm to 6pm [[Central European Time|CET]] (4pm to 5pm [[Western European Time|WET]]), and from 11am to 12pm on [[CNBC World]] in the United States. The programme was presented from [[London]] by [[Louisa Bojesen]]. The show covered the last half-hour of [[Trader (finance)|trades]] in the European [[stock market|equity markets]], and reported on the day's final numbers and top stories as the markets close at 5:30pm CET. As the major European markets are electronic, no actual "closing bell" was rung - nonetheless there was a countdown on the CNBC Europe [[Digital on-screen graphic|strap]] and video wall until the close of trade. Other regular segments included a daily "Guest Investor" and a [[technical analysis]] slot.

Prior to 26 March 2007, the programme ran for two hours until 7pm CET. The second hour of the programme was of a slower pace, offering a more in-depth look at financial and political events. During major European [[trade fair]]s and political events such as [[European Union|EU]] summits and [[election]]s, ''European Closing Bell'' was often anchored live from these events. Many of these features were incorporated into the extended ''[[Europe Tonight]]'' after its relaunch on the same date.

The theme music for the programme is the same as that used by the US version of ''[[Closing Bell]]''.

On 9 March 2015, ''European Closing Bell'' launched new titles based on the US version used since 13 October 2014.

On 18 December 2015, ''European Closing Bell'' ended its 12-year run as it was replaced with the US-produced ''[[Squawk Alley]]'', which began airing on CNBC Europe on 21 December 2015.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Balsemao-younger-Expresso.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Francisco Pinto Balsemão]] --&gt;
'''Francisco José Pereira Pinto Balsemão''' ({{IPA-pt|fɾɐ̃ˈsiʃku ˈpĩtu baɫsɨˈmɐ̃w̃}}; born 1 September 1937 in [[Lisbon]]), is a Portuguese [[businessman]], former [[journalist]] and retired politician, who served as [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister of Portugal]], from 1981 to 1983.

==Background==
He is the son of Henrique Patrício de Balsemão ([[Guarda, Portugal|Guarda]], [[Guarda Municipality, Portugal|Guarda]], 9 September 1897 – ?) and wife (married Lisbon, 21 May 1922) Maria Adelaide van Zeller de Castro Pereira ([[Sintra]], 11 August 1897 – ?).

==Career==
Being a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] in Law from the [[University of Lisbon]], Pinto Balsemão's pre-political career was in newspaper publishing. After working as a journalist and then as an administrator of ''[[Diário Popular]]'' (the ''People's Daily'' in English) from 1963 to 1971, he founded the ''[[Expresso (Portuguese newspaper)|Expresso]]'' magazine in 1973 and continued to direct it until 1980. He is one of top managers and owners of [[Impresa]] media group.

Pinto Balsemão was Member of parliament before the revolution (1969-1973), when, together with [[Francisco de Sá Carneiro]], [[Joaquim Magalhães Mota]], [[Carlos Mota Pinto]], [[João Bosco Mota Amaral]], [[Alberto João Jardim]], [[António Barbosa de Melo]] and [[António Marques Mendes]], he helped to found the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), of which he is currently member number 1. In 1975 he was elected to the [[Constituent Assembly]], which was charged with drafting a new [[Constitution of Portugal|constitution]] and served as an interim legislature. Pinto Balsemão was chosen as a Vice-President of this body.

Following the victory of the [[Democratic Alliance (Portugal)|Democratic Alliance]] (a coalition led by the PSD) in two [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|parliamentary]] elections (in 1979 and 1980), Pinto Balsemão held senior positions in two [[Cabinet (politics)|cabinets]] led by Prime Minister Sá Carneiro.

When Sá Carneiro was killed in an air accident on 4 December 1980, the Social Democratic Party chose Pinto Balsemão to succeed him.  Despite his reputation for competence, he was widely perceived as lacking Sá Carneiro's charisma. He had difficulty maintaining the level of support enjoyed by his party, which had been based to a large extent on Sá Carneiro's personal popularity.  He also had to cope with friction within the Democratic Alliance, and found the [[People's Party (Portugal)|Democratic and Social Centre]] leader, [[Diogo Freitas do Amaral]], a difficult ally. These factors contributed to his defeat in the [[Portuguese legislative election, 1983|parliamentary election]] of 1983.  He finally retired from Parliament in 1987 though not from politics.

Pinto Balsemão currently serves as Chairman of the [[European Publishers Council]] [http://www.epceurope.org/index.shtml] and as Chief Executive Officer of ''[[Impresa|Grupo Impresa]]'' in Portugal. He was the founder on 6 October 1992 of [[Sociedade Independente de Comunicação]] (SIC), the first Portuguese private television network.

He is also a member of ''Steering Committee'' of the [[Bilderberg Group]], and as such has attracted some controversy. He participated in more than 30 Bilderberg-Conferences since 1981.

He is also a Member of the [[Portuguese Council of State]], elected by the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] and chosen by the current [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]] his fellow party colleague and former president of the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) [[Aníbal Cavaco Silva]].

'''Godspeed You! Black Emperor''' is a Canadian [[experimental music]] collective which originated in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] in 1994. The group releases recordings through [[Constellation Records (Canada)|Constellation]], an [[independent record label]] also located in Montreal. After the release of their [[F♯A♯∞|debut album]] in 1997, the group toured regularly from 1998 to 2002. In 2003, the band announced an indefinite hiatus in order for members to pursue other musical interests. In the intervening period, the group was occasionally rumored to have broken up,&lt;ref name="nmemis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/godspeed-you-black-emperor-12-1329786|title=Godspeed You!

Since reforming, they have released three more albums, the most recent being ''[[Luciferian Towers]]'' in September 2017.

The band has gained a dedicated [[cult following]] and remains very influential in the [[post-rock]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thekey.xpn.org/2013/09/16/just-announced-post-rock-cult-faves-godspeed-you-black-emperor-headlining-union-transfer/ |title=Just Announced: Post-rock cult faves Godspeed You!

==History==
Godspeed You! Black Emperor was formed in 1994 in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], by [[Efrim Menuck]] ([[Electric guitar|guitar]]), [[Mike Moya]] (guitar), and [[Mauro Pezzente]] ([[Bass guitar|bass]]).&lt;ref name="Wire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainwashed.com/godspeed/wire.html|title=Interview in The Wire|year=1998|author=David Keenan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band took its name from ''[[God Speed You! Black Emperor]]'', a 1976 Japanese [[black-and-white]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] by director [[Mitsuo Yanagimachi]], which follows the exploits of a [[Bōsōzoku|Japanese biker gang]], the Black Emperors.&lt;ref name="Wire"/&gt; The band initially assembled after being offered a supporting act for another local band named Steak 72.&lt;ref name="wire2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brainwashed.com/godspeed/wire2.html|title=Godspeed You Black Emperor! interview with ''The Wire''|accessdate=February 24, 2009|year=2000|author=Keenan, David|work=brainwashed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the trio performed live on a few separate occasions, before ultimately deciding to produce an album. The cassette, ''[[All Lights Fucked on the Hairy Amp Drooling]]'', was self-released in December 1994 and limited to thirty-three copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cstrecords.com/html/allfucked.html|title=Godspeed&amp;nbsp;– ''All Lights Fucked'' Cassette|accessdate=December 17, 2006|publisher=Constellation Records|year=2000|author=Constellation Records|work=Godspeed Releases |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000304001438/http://www.cstrecords.com/html/allfucked.html |archivedate=March 4, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the limited release of the cassette, the band quickly expanded and continued to perform live periodically. According to Menuck, joining the group was quite simple: "It was like if anyone knew anybody who played an instrument and seemed like an okay person, they would sort of join up."&lt;ref name="brainwashed1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brainwashed.com/godspeed/deadmetheney/interviews/amazeine.htm|title=Godspeed You! Black Emperor interview with ''aMAZEzine!''|accessdate=February 14, 2009|year=1998|author=St-Jacques, Marie-Douche|work=aMAZEzine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short order, the group's numbers ebbed and flowed. Local musicians would often join the band for a handful of performances, then depart. The revolving door nature of the group's membership frequently caused it strain before the release of ''[[F♯ A♯ ∞]]''.&lt;ref name="brainwashed1"/&gt;  After that release, the group stabilized around a nine-person lineup with Menuck, Moya and [[David Bryant (musician)|David Bryant]] on guitars, Pezzente and Thierry Amar on bass guitars, Aidan Girt and Bruce Cawdron on drums, and Sophie Trudeau and Norsola Johnson on violin and cello respectively.  Moya would depart in 1998 to focus on [[HṚṢṬA]], being replaced by Roger Tellier-Craig of [[Fly Pan Am]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Godspeed You !

Although various members of the band are often pinned down as [[anarchism|anarchists]], for a rather long time no one in the band explicitly subscribed to this label;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.expressnightout.com/2008/05/allusions_of_grandeur_thee_silver_mt_zio/ |title=Allusions of Grandeur: Thee Silver Mt. Zion |publisher=Expressnightout.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, as of 2014, Menuck was calling himself an anarchist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rubsam|first=Rob|url=http://therumpus.net/2014/04/the-rumpus-interview-with-efrim-menuck/|title=The Rumpus Interview with Efrim Menuck|publisher=The Rumpus|accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, there is a strong political component to the band's music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richardson|first=Mark|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17283-allelujah-dont-bend-ascend/|title="Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!"

Members of the group have formed a number of [[side project]]s, including [[Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra &amp; Tra-La-La Band]], [[Fly Pan Am]], [[HṚṢṬA]], [[Esmerine]], and [[Set Fire to Flames]].

The band released the CD versions of its first two albums and EP on the [[Kranky (record label)|Kranky]] record label, and released the [[Gramophone record|LP]]s through Constellation Records. All editions of their subsequent studio material have been released through Constellation.

In 2004, long-time guitarist Roger Tellier-Craig left the band on amicable terms to devote more time to [[Fly Pan Am]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Godspeed You!

The group was once misconstrued as being a band of terrorists.&lt;ref name="cstimages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cstrecords.com/cst_images/gybeimages_web.jpg |title=Godspeed You!

She quickly passed a note to another customer asking them to call the police. When the local police appeared, the group was held until it could be questioned by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. Although the police were suspicious of the band's anti-government documents and some photos it had (such as those of oil rigs), they found no incriminating evidence.  After [[background check]]s were run, the ensemble was released from custody and continued on its way to its next show in Saint Louis,  [[Columbia, MO|MO]]. [[Efrim Menuck]] later spoke to the crowd during their appearance in Missouri about what happened to them and speculated that their origin was a motive for being released quickly ("It's a good thing we're nice white kids from Canada").&lt;ref name="2003-03-16"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/gybe2003-03-16.shn|title=Godspeed You Black Emperor! at Mississippi Nights (2003-03-16)|accessdate=December 24, 2006|publisher=Internet Archive|year=2003|author=Godspeed You Black Emperor!|work=Live Music Archive|format=shn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was mentioned in [[Michael Moore]]'s book ''[[Dude, Where's My Country?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Noteworthy Facts You May Not Know About Godspeed You!

In 2010, the band reported it was reuniting for an [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] music event in the UK as well as further US dates. Mike Moya re-joined the band for the reunion, while original cellist Norsola Johnson declined to participate. The band played a full North American and European tour in 2011, and more dates in the UK including an appearance at the ATP '[[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|I'll Be Your Mirror]]' music festival in London.

In 2011, in an interview with Voir, band member Bruce Cawdron announced that the band was working on new material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laveaux|first=Oliver|title=Godspeed prépare un nouveau disque|url=http://www.voir.ca/blogs/nouvelles_musique/archive/2011/05/27/godspeed-pr-233-pare-un-nouveau-disque.aspx|work=Voir Magazine|publisher=Voir|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2012, it was announced that the band would be performing at the 2012 Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago.  On March 15, 2012, it was announced that the band would be performing at the 2012 All Tomorrow's Parties I'll Be Your Mirror festival in New York.&lt;ref name="atpibym2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/ibymusa2012.php |title=I'll Be Your Mirror USA 2012 curated by Greg Dulli &amp; ATP - All Tomorrow's Parties |publisher=Atpfestival.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drummer Timothy Herzog began touring with the band upon the departure of Bruce Cawdron.

In 2013, the band won the [[Polaris Music Prize]], but it criticized the cost of the ceremony during the time of austerity, stating, "Maybe the next celebration should happen in a cruddier hall, without the corporate banners and culture overlords."&lt;ref name="Polaris"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24231672 |title=Godspeed You! Black Emperor criticise Polaris prize |accessdate=September 25, 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 2015, Godspeed You! Black Emperor released its fifth album, ''[[Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress]]''.&lt;ref name=cst111&gt;{{cite web|title=GY!BE - 'Asunder, Sweet And Other Distress' - Constellation Records|url=http://cstrecords.com/cst111/|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, 2017, the group released its sixth album, ''[[Luciferian Towers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Luciferian Towers"|url=http://cstrecords.com/cst126/|website=Constellation Records|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live concerts==
Film loop projections are an important aspect of the group's live show, explained by [[Efrim Menuck]] as "[putting] the whole into context".&lt;ref name="oorinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brainwashed.com/godspeed/oor.html|title=Interview with Godspeed You Black Emperor!|accessdate=December 24, 2006|publisher=OOR|year=2001|author=Visser, Menno|work=OOR Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the band is taper-friendly—that is, it allows audience members to record its live performances—fans often release new material before the band makes an official recording.&lt;ref name="archive1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/gybe2003-05-14.shnf|title=Godspeed You Black Emperor! at L'Olympic (2003-05-14)|accessdate=December 17, 2006|publisher=Internet Archive|year=2003|author=Godspeed You Black Emperor!|work=Live Music Archive|format=shnf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band toured Australia/New Zealand for the first time in February 2013, including a performance at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] 'I'll Be Your Mirror' festival in Melbourne on February 16.

The band toured China for the first time in April 2013, giving performances in Shanghai and Beijing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Godspeed You! Black Emperor China Tour|url=http://www.spli-t.com/gybe/en/|website=Spli-t|date=April 1, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and revisited China in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Godspeed You!

The band supported [[Nine Inch Nails]] on its [[Twenty Thirteen Tour|Tension tour]] in October 2013, starting at the [[TD Garden]] in [[Boston]] on October 11.&lt;ref name="nintour"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/51053-nine-inch-nails-announce-massive-tour-with-godspeed-you-black-emperor/|title=Nine Inch Nails Announce Massive Tour With Godspeed You! Black Emperor|accessdate=June 6, 2013|publisher=Pitchfork|year=2013|author=Minsker, Evan|work=Pitchfork}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a break for much of 2014 the band embarked on a busy schedule of concert and festival dates across North America, Europe and around the world during 2015 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlists/godspeed-you-black-emperor-63d69a73.html|title=Godspeed You! Black Emperor Concert Setlists|website=setlist.fm|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two new songs were previewed in many of the shows picking up the fan titles "Buildings" and "Railroads" from the projections that accompanied them. The band also lent live performances of some of their older and current tracks to a revival of the 2005 work "monumental", by Canadian dance troupe, [[Holy Body Tattoo]] during 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bam.org/dance/2016/monumental|title=monumental|website=BAM.org|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gwen Fuqua''' (born '''Gwendolyn Gordy'''; November 26, 1927 &amp;ndash; November 8, 1999&lt;ref name="findagrave"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/55084710|title=Gwen Gordy Fuqua (1927-1999) - Find a Grave Memorial|accessdate=September 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[United States of America|American]] [[businesswoman]], [[songwriter]] and [[music composer|composer]], most notably writing hit songs such as "[[Lonely Teardrops]]", "[[All I Could Do Was Cry]]" and "[[Distant Lover]]". She earned her full name after marrying [[Harvey Fuqua]] and kept the name after their divorce.

==Biography==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}

===Early life and career===
Gwen Gordy was born to Berry Gordy Sr. and Bertha Ida ([[married and maiden names|née]] Fuller) Gordy in Detroit. She was the youngest of the four Gordy sisters ([[Esther Gordy Edwards|Esther]], [[Anna Gordy Gaye|Anna]] and Loucye) and the third youngest of the [[Gordy family|entire family]] (brothers [[Berry Gordy|Berry]] and [[Robert Gordy|Robert]] were born after her).

Following graduation from high school, Gwen owned the photo concession at Detroit's popular Flame Show Bar, which helped to make her a celebrity in Detroit's nightlife. By the late 1950s, Gordy had also become a cheerleader for brother Berry's musical efforts. She provided Berry with his first important music business contact when she introduced him to the manager of the club, a white man named Al Green. Green managed music stars like Johnnie Ray and LaVern Baker and he had just signed a new singer from Detroit named Jackie Wilson.

Green also owned a music publishing company and was looking for new material.  She had a songwriting partnership with her brother Berry Gordy and Roquel "Billy" Davis, a childhood friend who had connections with Chess Records in Chicago. The partners started out with a bang by writing "Jim Dandy Got Married" for LaVern Baker on the Atlantic label and "All I Could Do Was Cry" for Etta James on Argo, a Chess subsidiary label. By far, however, their greatest early success was writing the first big hits for Jackie Wilson.
 
Starting with "Reet Petite", Gwen, Berry and Davis penned five consecutive Jackie Wilson hits. "Lonely Teardrops", "[[That's Why (I Love You So)]]", "To Be Loved", and "I'll Be Satisfied" all established Wilson as one of Rock and Roll's hottest new stars.
Gordy earned small pay during this period of her work with Wilson's label [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]].

Although Berry, Gwen, and Roquel had provided five consecutive hits for Jackie Wilson, they had to split the songwriting royalties three ways. To bring in more income, Berry demanded that some of their songs be used for the B sides on Wilson's recordings. After he was turned down by manager Nat Tarnopol, the trio decided to end their association with Jackie.

Gwen Gordy was the first to put the idea of starting a record company into action. She formed a label with Roquel Davis and named the company 'Anna', after her sister.  Davis then used his contacts to make a deal with Chess Records to distribute their new Anna label nationally. Gwen and Roquel both wanted Berry to become a partner with them.  However, Berry decided to go out on his own.  The label helped to distribute the local Tamla Records single, [[Barrett Strong]]'s "[[Money (That's What I Want)]]", which became a top 40 hit in 1960.

That year, Gordy co-wrote the ballad "[[All I Could Do Was Cry]]", which was originally offered to [[Erma Franklin]] ([[Aretha Franklin|Aretha]]'s sister), who almost signed with Anna Records but was rebuffed by her father, [[C. L. Franklin]]. The song eventually was sold by [[Chess Records]] who recorded the song with [[Etta James]]. Shortly after meeting [[Harvey Fuqua]], they founded the labels Harvey Records and Tri-Phi Records, the latter label including [[The Spinners (American R&amp;B group)|The Spinners]], who recorded their first hit with the Gordy/Fuqua composition, "[[That's What Girls Are Made For]]".

In 1961, Motown absorbed Anna Records, signing [[Marvin Gaye]] in the process. The Harvey and Tri-Phi labels were absorbed by Motown two years later after that and Gordy and Fuqua accepted staff jobs with Motown, with Gordy handling business affairs, while Fuqua became a staff writer and producer. Alongside sister Anna, she co-headed Motown's Artist Development course and by the mid-1960s was managing acts such as the Spinners, [[Shorty Long]], [[Junior Walker|Junior Walker &amp; the All Stars]] and [[Tammi Terrell]], who signed to Motown in 1965. Gordy convinced Motown to allow Terrell to perform duets with Gaye.

In 1973, Gordy had hand in adding lyrics to Marvin Gaye's composition, "[[Distant Lover]]", which became a [[hit single]] a year later after Motown released a [[live music|live recording]] of the song. In 1977, Gordy founded '''Gwen Glenn Productions''' and produced for Motown acts such as [[High Inergy]] before retiring from the music business in the early 1980s.

==Personal life==
Gordy dated fellow composer Billy Davis for a number of years. However, the relationship imploded after Gordy got involved with Harvey Fuqua. Gordy and Fuqua married in 1961 and Gordy was known afterwards as Gwen Gordy Fuqua for the duration of her life, though in 1968, Gordy and Fuqua divorced. After most of the Spinners left Motown for [[Atlantic Records]] in 1972, she struck up a romance with ex-Spinners bandmate [[G.C. Cameron]], managed his career and later marrying him.&lt;ref name=soulwalking&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/G.C.Cameron.html|title=G.C. Cameron Page|accessdate=September 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple broke up in the late 1970s after Cameron left Motown. Gordy's production company "Gwen Glenn" was named after Gwen's son Glenn Gordy. Gordy moved to California in the early 1970s, where she'd remained until her death and lived comfortably off royalties after her career ended in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;&lt;ref name=soulwalking/&gt;

===Death===
Gwen succumbed to cancer at her home in [[San Diego, California]] on November 8, 1999 at the age of 71.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-11-14/news/9911170375_1_gordy-motown-fuqua|title=Gwendolyn Gordy Fuqua, 71, helped her music mogul brother...|accessdate=September 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="findagrave"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8730">A '''hierarchical organization''' is an [[organizational structure]] where every entity in the [[organization]], except one, is [[subordinate]] to a single other entity. This arrangement is a form of a [[hierarchy]]. In an organization, the hierarchy usually consists of a singular/group of [[Power (social and political)|power]] at the top with subsequent levels of power beneath them. This is the dominant mode of organization among large organizations; most [[corporation]]s, [[Forms of government|governments]], and [[organized religion]]s are hierarchical organizations with different levels of [[management]], power or [[authority]]. For example, the broad, top-level overview of the general organization of the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|Catholic Church]] consists of the [[Pope]], then the [[Cardinal (Catholic)|Cardinals]], then the [[Archbishop]]s, and so on. 

Members of hierarchical organizational structures chiefly communicate with their immediate superior and with their immediate subordinates. Structuring organizations in this way is useful partly because it can reduce the communication overhead by limiting information flow; this is also its major limitation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Visualization==
A hierarchy is typically visualized as a [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], where the height of the ranking or person depicts their power status and the width of that level represents how many people or business divisions are at that level relative to the whole—the highest-ranking people are at the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]], and there are very few of them; the [[Base (geometry)|base]] may include thousands of people who have no subordinates. These hierarchies are typically depicted with a [[tree structure|tree]] or [[triangle]] [[diagram]], creating an [[organizational chart]] or organigram. Those nearest the top have more power than those nearest the bottom, and there being fewer people at the top than at the bottom. As a result, superiors in a hierarchy generally have higher status and command greater rewards than their subordinates.

==Common models==
All governments and most companies have similar structures. Traditionally, the [[monarch]] was the pinnacle of the [[State (polity)|state]]. In many countries, [[feudalism]] and [[manorialism]] provided a formal [[social structure]] that established hierarchical links at every level of society, with the monarch at the top. 

In modern post-feudal states the nominal top of the hierarchy still remains the [[head of state]], which may be a [[president]] or a [[constitutional monarch]], although in many modern states the powers of the head of state are delegated among different bodies. Below the head, there is commonly a [[senate]], [[parliament]] or [[congress]], which in turn often delegate the day-to-day running of the country to a [[prime minister]]. In many [[democracies]], the people are considered to be the notional top of the hierarchy, over the head of state; in reality, the people's power is restricted to voting in elections.

In business, the business owner traditionally occupied the pinnacle of the [[organization]]. In most modern large companies, there is now no longer a single dominant shareholder, and the collective power of the business owners is for most purposes delegated to a [[board of directors]], which in turn delegates the day-to-day running of the company to a [[managing director]] or [[CEO]]. Again, although the shareholders of the company are the nominal top of the hierarchy, in reality many companies are run at least in part as personal fiefdoms by their management; [[corporate governance]] rules are an attempt to mitigate this tendency.

== Studies ==
The [[organizational development]] theorist [[Elliott Jacques]] identified a special role for hierarchy in his concept of [[requisite organization]]. 
 
The [[iron law of oligarchy]], introduced by [[Robert Michels]], describes the inevitable tendency of hierarchical organizations to become [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] in their decision making.

The [[Peter principle|Peter Principle]] is a term coined by [[Laurence J. Peter]] in which the selection of a candidate for a position in an  hierarchical organization is based on the candidate's performance in their current role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role. Thus, employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively, and managers in an hierarchical organization "rise to the level of their incompetence." 

[[Hierarchiology]] is another term coined by Laurence J. Peter, described in his humorous book of the same name, to refer to the study of hierarchical organizations and the behavior of their members.

{{quote|Having formulated the Principle, I discovered that I had inadvertently founded a new science, hierarchiology, the study of hierarchies. The term hierarchy was originally used to describe the system of church government by priests graded into ranks. The contemporary meaning includes any organization whose members or employees are arranged in order of rank, grade or class. Hierarchiology, although a relatively recent discipline, appears to have great applicability to the fields of public and private administration.|Dr. [[Laurence J. Peter]] and [[Raymond Hull]]|''[[The Peter Principle]]: Why Things Always Go Wrong''}}

[[The IRG Solution – hierarchical incompetence and how to overcome it]] argued that hierarchies were inherently incompetent, and were only able to function due to large amounts of informal [[lateral communication]] fostered by private informal networks.

==Criticism and alternatives==
In the work of diverse theorists such as [[William James]] (1842–1910), [[Michel Foucault]] (1926–1984) and [[Hayden White]], important critiques of hierarchical epistemology are advanced. James famously asserts in his work "Radical Empiricism" that clear distinctions of type and category are a constant but unwritten goal of scientific reasoning, so that when they are discovered, success is declared. But if aspects of the world are organized differently, involving inherent and intractable ambiguities, then scientific questions are often considered unresolved. A hesitation to declare success upon the discovery of ambiguities leaves heterarchy at an artificial and subjective disadvantage in the scope of human knowledge. This bias is an artifact of an aesthetic or pedagogical preference for hierarchy, and not necessarily an expression of objective observation.

Hierarchies and hierarchical thinking has been criticized by many people, including [[Susan McClary]] and one political philosophy which is vehemently opposed to hierarchical organization: [[anarchism]]. [[Heterarchy]] is the most commonly proposed alternative to hierarchy and this has been combined with [[responsible autonomy]] by [[Gerard Fairtlough]] in his work on [[Triarchy]] theory. The most beneficial aspect of a hierarchical organization is the clear command that is established. However, hierarchy may become dismantled by abuse of power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Amidst constant innovation in information and communication technologies, hierarchical authority structures are giving way to greater decision-making latitude for individuals and more flexible definitions of job activities and this new style of work presents a challenge to existing organizational forms, with some research studies contrasting traditional organizational forms against groups that operate as online communities that are characterized by personal motivation and the satisfaction of making one's own decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, Rosson, Rosson (2007). The Future of Work: What Does Online Community Have to Do with It? 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'07)&lt;/ref&gt;  With all levels of an organization having access to information and communication via digital means, power structures align more as a [[wirearchy]], enabling the flow of power and authority to be based not on hierarchical levels, but on information, trust, credibility, and a focus on results.

Forms of imperfect competition include:

* [[Monopolistic competition]]: A situation in which many firms with slightly different products compete. Production costs are above what may be achieved by perfectly competitive firms, but society benefits from the product differentiation.
* [[Monopoly]]: A firm with no competitors in its industry. A monopoly firm produces less output, has higher costs, and sells its output for a higher price than it would if constrained by competition. These negative outcomes usually generate government regulation.
* [[Oligopoly]]: An industry with only a few firms. If they collude, they form a [[cartel]] to reduce output and drive up profits the way a monopoly does.
**[[Duopoly]]: A special form of Oligopoly, with only two firms in an industry.
* [[Monopsony]]: A market with a single buyer and many sellers.
* [[Oligopsony]]: A market with a few buyers and many sellers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1743">The '''International Recording Media Association''' ('''IRMA'''), previously known as the '''International Tape Association''' ('''ITA'''), was an international [[trade]] association dealing with every facet of recording, [[recording media|media]] and related industries. Their membership includes raw material providers, manufacturers, replicators, duplicators, packagers, [[copyright]] holders, and others.

Founded in 1970 by [[broadcast media|media]] pioneer [[Larry Finley]], IRMA today counts such recording media giants as Sony, Panasonic, JVC, BMG, Universal, Fuji, Eastman Kodak, Warner, and EMI among its member companies.

According to their official website:

:''IRMA has been around more than 30 years. Beginning with the introduction of the [[Compact audio cassette|audiocassette]], through the home video revolution, and right up to the current digital and electronic delivery era, IRMA has always been the organization companies have turned to for news, networking, market research, information services, and leadership."''

With the advent of digital delivery IRMA evolved into the CDSA, the Content Delivery &amp; Security Association.  Their aim IP protection.  The CDSA merged with the MESA (Media &amp; Entertainment Services Alliance) by bringing additional aspects of digital delivery, fulfilment and distribution in a single organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5745">'''Jay R. Galbraith''' (Feb. 26, 1939 - April 8, 2014) was an American organizational theorist, consultant and Professor at the [[International Institute for Management Development]], known for his work on strategy and organization design.&lt;ref&gt;[[Schein, Edgar H.]] ''Organizational culture and leadership.'' Vol. 2. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pfeffer, Jeffrey]], and [[Gerald R. Salancik]]. ''The external control of organizations: A resource dependence perspective.'' Stanford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], Galbraith obtained his BSc in Chemical Engineering in 1962 at the [[University of Cincinnati]], and at the [[Indiana University]] his MBA in 1964, and his PhD in Business Administration with the thesis, entitled "Motivational Determinants of Job Performance: An Empirical Study."&lt;ref name="JRG CV"&gt;[http://classic.marshall.usc.edu/assets/044/9472.pdf JAY R. GALBRAITH], Curriculum Vitae at ''classic.marshall.usc.edu.'' Accessed 23.01.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galbraith had started his academic career as Instructor at the [[Indiana University]] in 1964. In 1966 he moved to [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], where he was appointed Assistant professor and became associate Professor in 1970. From 1962 to 1966 he was Professor at the European Institute of Advanced Studies in Management, Brussels. From 1974 to 1978 he was Professor at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]], and from 1986 to 1995 Professor of Clinical Management at the [[USC Marshall School of Business]] and Senior Research Scientist at its Center for Effective Organizations. In Lausanne, Switzerland he was Professor at the [[International Institute for Management Development]] from 1995 to 2000, where he became Professor Emeritus in 2000. Back in the United States, he rejoined the USC Center for Effective Organizations as Senior Research Scientist.&lt;ref name="JRG CV"/&gt;

In 1978 Galbraith had started his own consultancy firm Jay R. Galbraith Management Consultants Ltd. He had been awarded the McKinsey Foundation Doctoral Thesis Award - First Prize in 1967, and the Crystal Apple Award by the Association for the Management
of Organization Design in 1994. His book ''Organization Design'' was elected "Outstanding Book on Organization in 1976 - 1977" by the Organization Development Council in 1977, and his ''Organizing for the Future,'' was second in the Industry Week's top ten books of the year 1993.&lt;ref name="JRG CV"/&gt;

=== Organizational architecture ===
[[File:Galbright star model.png|300px|right|thumb|Galbraith's Star Model of organizational design]]
Organization design can be defined narrowly, as the process of reshaping organization [[structure]] and roles, or it can more effectively be defined as the alignment of structure, process, rewards, metrics and talent with the strategy of the business. Jay Galbraith and Amy Kates have made the case persuasively (building on years of work by Galbraith) that attention to all of these organizational elements is necessary to create new capabilities to compete in a given market.  This systemic view, often referred to as the "star model" approach, is more likely to lead to better performance.

Organization design may involve strategic decisions, but is properly viewed as a path to effective strategy execution.  The design process nearly always entails making trade-offs of one set of structural benefits against another.  Many companies fall into the trap of making repeated changes in organization structure, with little benefit to the business.  This often occurs because changes in structure are relatively easy to execute while creating the impression that something substantial is happening.  This often leads to cynicism and confusion within the organization.  More powerful change happens when there are clear design objectives driven by a new business strategy or forces in the market that require a different approach to organizing resources.

In 1977, Cramer graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Harvard College]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[government]].&lt;ref name="HARVARDLAWTODAY12232005"&gt;December 23, 2005.{{cite web|url=http://today.law.harvard.edu/school-to-host-broadcast-of-mad-money-featuring-graduate-jim-cramer/| title= ''School to host broadcast of 'Mad Money' featuring graduate Jim Cramer'' ''Harvard Law Today'' |accessdate= Dec 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=isb/&gt; Cramer began his involvement with journalism in college, where he was the President and Editor-in-Chief of ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]''.&lt;ref name="HARVARDLAWTODAY12232005"/&gt; In 1984, Cramer received his [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Harvard Law School]].&lt;ref name="HARVARDLAWTODAY12232005"/&gt;&lt;ref name=isb/&gt;

== Career ==
=== Early career as reporter ===
After graduating from Harvard, Cramer worked in several entry-level reporting jobs. Dating back to March 1, 1978, Cramer worked for the ''[[Tallahassee Democrat]]'' in [[Tallahassee]], [[Florida]], where he covered the [[Ted Bundy]] murders. Then-executive editor, [[Richard Oppel]], has said "[Cramer] was like a driving ram. He was great at getting the story." &lt;ref name="bw20051031"/&gt; He subsequently wrote for the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]]''. During this time, his apartment was robbed on multiple occasions, eventually losing all of his possessions and forcing him to live out of his car for several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|title=Crazy, Like a Fox|author=Kevin Cahillane|date=November 6, 2005|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/06njPERSON.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked for [[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Jerry Brown]].&lt;ref name=pabook/&gt;

Cramer was one of the first reporters at ''[[American Lawyer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE3D71E3AF937A15750C0A96F948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print|title=At the Bar | first=David | last=Margolick | accessdate=May 6, 2010 | date=March 24, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his years at Harvard Law School, Cramer worked as a research assistant for [[Alan Dershowitz]]. He assisted Dershowitz's [[Sunny von Bülow#Appeal|campaign to acquit]] alleged murderer [[Claus von Bülow]] despite the fact that Cramer believed von Bülow was "supremely guilty." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jim|last=Cramer|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=978-0-7432-2489-5|year=2005|page=27|title=Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cramer was admitted to the New York Bar in 1985 but his license to practice law was suspended on April 2, 2009 for failure to pay the registration fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2009/2009_02525.htm    |title=Matter of Attorneys in Violation of Judiciary Law \s 468-a|publisher=Iapps.courts.state.ny.us |accessdate=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investing ===
Cramer started investing in the stock market during his time at law school.&lt;ref name=pabook/&gt; Cramer began promoting his holdings by leaving stock picks on his answering machine. This impressed ''[[The New Republic]]'' owner [[Martin Peretz]], who gave him $500,000 to invest. In two years, Cramer made $150,000 for Peretz.&lt;ref name="bw20051031"/&gt;

Cramer's track record helped him obtain employment in 1984 as a [[stockbroker]] with [[Goldman Sachs]]' [[Private Wealth Management]] &lt;ref name="locbio"&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/bookfest/2006/authors/cramer.html Jim Cramer biography], Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; division. Cramer's success in this position led him to found his own hedge fund, Cramer &amp; Co. (later Cramer, Berkowitz &amp; Co.), in 1987. The fund operated out of the offices of hedge fund pioneer [[Michael Steinhardt]]'s Steinhardt, Fine, Berkowitz &amp; Co. and early investors included [[Eliot Spitzer]] (a Harvard classmate, one of his oldest friends and former Governor of New York who resigned),&lt;ref&gt;Celizic, Mike. Todayshow.com, 12 March 2008, "[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/23591111/ Jim Cramer on pal Spitzer: ‘Eliot screwed up’]." Retrieved 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Brill, and Peretz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/articles/070218/26eecramer_2.htm |title=Money &amp; Business: Meet CNBC's Mad Money Man – US News and World Report |publisher=Usnews.com |date=August 30, 2007 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Cramer's tenure with the fund from 1988 to 2000, he had one year of negative returns in 1998. The following year, the fund returned 47% and in 2000 28%, beating the [[S&amp;P 500]] by 38 percentage points.&lt;ref name="bw20051031"/&gt; Cramer retired from his hedge fund in 2001, finishing with a 24% average annual return over 14 years and having "routinely [taken] home $10 million a year and more." &lt;ref name="bw20051031"/&gt; The fund was taken over by his former partner Jeff Berkowitz after Cramer's retirement. During that time, he was also an "editor at large" for ''[[SmartMoney]]'' magazine and was accused of unethically combining his investing and reporting activities when he bought stocks that he recommended just before his recommendation article came out, contributing to a $2 million personal gain.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Zuckerman, [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/business/smart-money-rethinks-conflict-rule.html "Smart Money Rethinks Conflict Rule"]. ''New York Times'', February 20, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Cramer is barred by CNBC from trading stocks with his personal funds although he makes picks and sells his recommendations.

In 1996 Cramer co-founded TheStreet, Inc. [formerly TheStreet.com, Inc.] with ''The New Republic'' editor Martin Peretz, one of his hedge fund's original clients. Cramer is currently a market commentator and adviser to the TheStreet, Inc. and is its second-largest shareholder.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt; Cramer also manages a [[charitable trust]] stock portfolio which is tied to TheStreet, Inc. through a paid subscription service called Action Alerts ''PLUS'' Portfolio.&lt;ref name="bw20051031"&gt;"[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_44/b3957001.htm The Mad Man Of Wall Street] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213230149/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_44/b3957001.htm |date=2008-02-13 }}" ''BusinessWeek'', October 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Cramer owns a 10 per cent stake in TheStreet, the market value of which peaked at $1.7 billion but by 2014, the Nasdaq-listed company was worth less than $80 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Financial Times |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/99f24d20-7b40-11e4-87d4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3Kwn5XyoE |title=Activist urges Cramer to sell TheStreet |publisher=Financial Times |subscription=yes |date=2014-12-04 |accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cramer claimed to be worth $50 to $100 million in October 2005.&lt;ref name="bw20051031"/&gt;

In 2009, Cramer received earnings of $461,276 from TheStreet, Inc.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"&gt;Apr 15, 2010. {{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1080056/000114420410020662/v181279_def14a.htm | title= ''Online Copy of US SEC Schedule 14A Proxy Statement for TheStreet.com, Inc.'' sec.gov |accessdate= Dec 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, Cramer was the chairman of the board of TheStreet.com, Inc.&lt;ref name="sec.gov"/&gt;

=== Career with CNBC ===
{{Main|Mad Money}}
The cable television program ''Mad Money with Jim Cramer'' first aired on [[CNBC]] in 2005. According to  CNBC's Web site in an article titled, "Mad Money Manifesto" by Jim Cramer, the show's mission statement and Cramer's job:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... is not to tell you what to think but to teach you how to think about the market like a pro. This show is not about picking stocks. It's not about giving you tips that will make you money overnight – tips are for waiters. Our mission is educational, to teach you how to analyze stocks and the market through the prism of events.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To provide [[Do-it-yourself investing|DIY investors]] and other viewers with "the knowledge and the tools that will empower you to be a better investor," ''Mad Money'' features many segments, including: The ''Lightning Round'', ''Game Plan'', ''Execution Decision'', ''Off the Charts'', ''Sell Block'', ''Market Marshmallows'', ''Outrage of the Day'', ''Mad Bull Disease'', ''Am I Diversified'', and ''Mad Mail''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=About Mad Money
|author=Jim Cramer
|publisher=CNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being a frequent guest commentator on CNBC in the late 1990s, Cramer co-hosted CNBC shows ''[[America Now]]'' and ''[[Kudlow &amp; Cramer]]'' with [[Lawrence Kudlow]] in the early 2000s.

Cramer hosted a one-hour radio show, ''Jim Cramer's Real Money'', until December 2006. "Take the Money and Run" by the [[Steve Miller Band]] was the intro to each of his radio shows. The show was similar to his ''Mad Money'' TV show. He also guest-hosted in the slot caused by the cancellation of ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'' ([[MSNBC]] and [[WFAN]]/[[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]]) in May 2007.

On November 13, 2005, [[Dan Rather]] did a sit-down interview with Cramer on ''[[60 Minutes]]''. Among the topics of discussion were Cramer's past at his hedge fund; for example, his violent temper and what finally led him to come to his senses and "calm down."{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Footage of Cramer at his family home with his daughters and wife was also included.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} On November 15, 2005, Cramer mentioned on his program that he received hundreds of e-mails after his ''60 Minutes'' interview. This report was taped before Cramer's radio show, ''Smart Money with Jim Cramer'' moved to WOR and became syndicated under the CBS Radio banner.

In 2005, Cramer appeared as himself in two episodes of the television series ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''. He appeared to first announce that he had upgraded [[Bluth Company]] stock to a "Don't Buy" from a "Triple Sell," and then to say that the stock was not a "Don't Buy" anymore, but a "Risky."

Cramer has also made appearances on NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'', ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly]]'', [[ESPN Classic]]'s ''[[Cheap Seats (TV series)|Cheap Seats]]'', [[NBC]]'s ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' and [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. Season 7)|The Apprentice]]'' called "The Celebrity Apprentice."

Cramer also appeared in the 2008 motion picture ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' spoofing Stark Industries on his show ''Mad Money'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Carlo Dellaverson  |title=Cramer In 'Iron Man'  |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/24427046/  |publisher=CNBC |date= May 2, 2008|accessdate=May 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appears in the movie ''[[Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/08/movies/08stone.html?bl&amp;ex=1252555200&amp;en=ba7f1af0b1943951&amp;ei=5087&lt;/ref&gt; He also claims to have consulted for the original ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' movie by telling the filmmakers how he would get through to [[Gordon Gekko]].&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, Jim (2002).Confessions of a Street Addict. Simon &amp; Schuster. p. 33. {{ISBN|978-0-7432-2488-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2009, [[Jon Stewart]] interviewed Cramer on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and challenged Cramer's recommendations of [[Bear Stearns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-march-12-2009/jim-cramer-extended-interview-pt--3|title=March 12, 2009 - Jim Cramer|work=The Daily Show}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2009, Cramer appeared on ''[[Martha (TV series)|The Martha Stewart Show]]'' to promote his new book ''Getting Back to Even''. Cramer stated that it was a great time to invest in real estate {{citation needed|reason=Citation for his appearance on the show|date=March 2015}} and that he had recently purchased the DeBary Inn in [[Summit, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.nj.com/news/local/index.ssf/2010/02/summit_investors_revive_histor.html|title= Summit investors revive historic inn|publisher=[[NJ.com]] |date =February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action Alerts charitable trust==
In the timeframe of 2002 until May 2009 the performance of Cramer's charitable trust ''"Action Alerts PLUS"'' outpaced the [[S&amp;P 500]] and the [[Russell 2000]]; while the charitable trust accumulated a return of 31.75%, the S&amp;P 500 had a return of 18.75% and the Russell 2000 had a return of 22.51%. On an annual basis, the trust outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 7.35% and the Russell 2000 Index by 3.33%. Paul Bolster explains that Cramer beats the market in part because of the excess risk in his picks. "If we adjust for his market risk, we come up with an excess return that is essentially zero", Bolster said, adding that "zero", in this case, means his returns are roughly in line with the risk he's taking on.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips |first=Matt |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2009/05/20/do-jim-cramer-stock-picks-beat-the-market-finance-profs-investigate/ |title=Do Jim Cramer Stock Picks Beat the Market? Finance Profs Investigate – MarketBeat – WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another criticism of Actions Alerts Plus is that it does not compare itself to indexes that include dividend reinvestment (as the SEC requires for stock-oriented mutual funds).  According to a Kiplinger's article "One recent [Action Alerts PLUS] and included a chart, under the headline "Action Alert PLUS is CRUSHING the S&amp;P 500," showing that the picks returned about 39% from the portfolio's inception through last March 31, compared with 15.5% for the S&amp;P 500 over the same nine-year, three-month period. But the S&amp;P figure did not include reinvested dividends. With them, the S&amp;P 500 returned 38.3%."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kiplinger.com/article/investing/T052-C018-S001-cramer-s-murky-math.html |title=Cramer's Murky Math |publisher=kiplinger.com |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done by Wharton researchers Jonathan Hartley and Matthew Olson found that in the timeframe of August 2001 to March 2016, Cramer's charitable trust underperformed the [[S&amp;P 500]] primarily as a result of underexposure to market returns in years after the 2008 financial crisis. As of March 31, 2016, Cramer's trust since inception had a cumulative return of 64.5% where the S&amp;P 500 fewer dividends returned 70% during the same time frame. Wharton finance professor Robert Stambaugh said he didn't think the findings showed significant underperformance or outperformance when adjusting for a variety of factors, but did state "It's a commendable attempt to dig more deeply into the style that underlies Cramer's stock picks." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/jim-cramer-doesnt-beat-the-market-2016-05-13 |title=Jim Cramer doesn't beat the market |publisher=MarketWatch.com |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNBC does not permit Cramer to buy or sell any security he has spoken about on CNBC for the trust for five days following the broadcast. Whenever Cramer is acting within his portfolio or important news about his stocks occur, he sends out e-mails to his paying subscribers on TheStreet, Inc. Whenever mentioning a stock that he holds in his portfolio, he is required to disclose that he owns shares of such company on his CNBC show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brokersense.com/articles/jim-cramer-kramer-realmoney-com-vs-action-alerts-plus-rev-shark-feuerstein/ |title=RealMoney.com vs. Action Alerts Plus – Which One is Better? |publisher=Brokersense.com |accessdate=April 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120721231518/http://www.brokersense.com/articles/jim-cramer-kramer-realmoney-com-vs-action-alerts-plus-rev-shark-feuerstein/ |archivedate=July 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected controversies==

===Fox News Channel lawsuit===
In 2000 Cramer settled a lawsuit with [[Fox News Channel]] in which Fox had claimed Cramer reneged on a deal to produce a show for them. Their conflict began when Fox complained that Cramer promoted TheStreet, Inc's stock on the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Market manipulation===
In March 2007, a December 2006 interview from TheStreet, Inc's "Wall Street Confidential" webcast stirred controversy after it appeared on [[YouTube.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfC0mE9eVb4|title=Jim Cramer manipulation, insider trading, hedge fund scum|author=TheStreet.com TV; YouTube|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video, Cramer described activities used by hedge fund managers to manipulate stock prices—some of debatable legality and others illegal. He described how he could push stocks higher or lower with as little as $5 million in capital when he was running his hedge fund. Cramer said, "A lot of times when I was [[short (finance)|short]] at my hedge fund ... When I was positioned short—meaning I needed it down—I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the [[futures contract|futures]]." He also encouraged hedge funds to engage in this type of activity because it is "a very quick way to make money."&lt;ref name=kost/&gt;

Cramer stated that everything he did was legal, but that illegal activity is common in the hedge fund industry as well. He also stated that some hedge fund managers spread false rumors to drive a stock down: "What's important when you are in that hedge-fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new truth, to develop a fiction."&lt;ref name=kost&gt;{{cite news

Cramer said that one strategy to keep a stock price down is to spread false rumors to reporters he described as "the Pisanis of the world." The comment was a reference to CNBC correspondent [[Bob Pisani]], who reports from the trading floor of the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. "You have to use these guys," said Cramer.

===SEC subpoena===
In February 2006, an investigation by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) into allegations of collusion between short-sellers and a stock research firm led to the serving of subpoenas to TheStreet, Inc., and Cramer, as well as journalists for Dow Jones and Marketwatch.com. The SEC then began to back away from the subpoenas, indicating it had no intention of enforcing them after lawyers for Dow Jones said they would not comply. SEC Chairman [[Christopher Cox]] rebuked the SEC's staff attorneys for filing subpoenas on two Dow Jones reporters without first consulting him or the other top commissioners. Cox issued a statement saying neither he nor any of the SEC's four other commissioners were aware of the subpoenas, which he called "highly unusual."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The allegations had been raised publicly and in a lawsuit against Gradient by [[Overstock.com]] chief executive [[Patrick M. Byrne]]. In May 2007, it was revealed that the SEC had subpoenaed Byrne in May 2006, in connection with an investigation of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/05112007/business/company_byrne_d_on_probe_report_business_roddy_boyd.htm |title=Company Byrne-d on Probe Report |author=New York Post |date=May 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514042411/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05112007/business/company_byrne_d_on_probe_report_business_roddy_boyd.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market performance===
Cramer is the founder, former owner, and former Senior Partner of Cramer Berkowitz, a hedge fund where Cramer reported a compounded annual "rate of return of 24% after all fees for 15 years" at Cramer Berkowitz. He retired from his hedge fund in 2001, where he finished with a self-reported 36% return in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/id/15838187/&lt;/ref&gt; (These returns, however, cannot be independently verified, since hedge funds have no ticker symbols and are not regulated by the SEC. The only source should have been an independent client, who would have invested from day one.)

On August 3, 2007, Cramer made a plea for Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to cut interest rates supposedly because of comments he was getting from  investment banks and their concern about adjustable-rate mortgage borrowers' increasing loan rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cramer's Rant, the Anniversary |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=808465173&amp;play=1 |publisher=CNBC |author=Jim Cramer |date= July 29, 2008|accessdate=July 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2008, in an article in TheStreet.com entitled, "Look At The Facts," Cramer said, "The losses are increasing, the auction-rate preferreds are now biting, the mortgage implode-a-meter now measures how many home-builders are going under."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Look at the Facts |url=http://www.thestreet.com/p/_search/rmoney/jimcramerblog/10432518.html |publisher=TheStreet |author=Jim Cramer |date=30 July 2008|accessdate=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On "Hardball with Chris Matthews" for September 19, 2008, Cramer stated "It's not too late to be on the pom-pom ... the sideline" in regards to home teaser loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Hardball with Chris Matthews' for September 19, 2008 |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/26841599/ |publisher=MSNBC TV |author=Jim Cramer |date=September 19, 2008 |accessdate=September 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908100718/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/26841599/ |archivedate=September 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cramer spoke again on the Today Show on October 6, 2008, suggesting to investors, "Whatever money you need for the next five years, please take it out of the stock market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jim Cramer: Time to get out of the stock market |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27045699/ |publisher=Today MSNBC |author=Michael Inbar |date= October 6, 2008|accessdate=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 2008, ''Wall Street Journal'' bestselling author Eric Tyson, criticized Cramer's stock picks and his performance in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.erictyson.com/articles/20080922 |title=The Worth of Jim Cramer's Advice |accessdate=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An August 20, 2007 article in Barrons stated that within the select time frame of the previous two years, "his picks haven't beaten the market. Over the past two years, viewers holding Cramer's stocks would be up 12% while the Dow rose 22% and the S&amp;P 500 16%."&lt;ref name="barrons1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Alpert |first=Bill |url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB118681265755995100.html |title=Shorting Cramer - Barrons.com |publisher=Online.barrons.com |date=August 20, 2007 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNBC disputed the magazine's findings.&lt;ref name="barrons1"/&gt;  In a February 9, 2009, story, Barrons further reported that betting against Cramer's Buy recommendations using options in the short term could yield 25% in the initial month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill Alpert|date=February 9, 2009|url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB123397107399659271.html|title=Cramer's Star Outshines his Stock Picks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cramer's responses to criticism===

====The White House====
On March 2, 2009, Cramer drew the attention of some critics after his evaluation of [[Barack Obama|President Obama]]'s spending plans and the administration's handling of the banking crisis. Cramer's name came up on March 3, 2009, during a [[White House]] press briefing after Cramer said that Obama was responsible for "the greatest wealth destruction I have seen by a president".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cramer to White House: Wealth Destruction Is Real |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/29490969/ |publisher=CNBC |date= March 3, 2009|accessdate=March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An offended White House administration shot back,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=White House Knocks Jim Cramer For Calling Obama Budget "Greatest Wealth Destruction By a President" |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnbc/white_house_knocks_jim_cramer_for_calling_obama_budget_greatest_wealth_destruction_by_a_president_110203.asp |publisher=CNBC |date=March 3, 2009 |accessdate=March 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305165325/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnbc/white_house_knocks_jim_cramer_for_calling_obama_budget_greatest_wealth_destruction_by_a_president_110203.asp |archivedate=March 5, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Press Secretary [[Robert Gibbs]] stating, "If you turn on a certain program, it's geared to a very small audience. I'm not entirely sure what he's pointing to make some of the statements." When pressed further by NBC's Tom Costello, Gibbs said, "You can go back and look at any number of statements he's made in the past about the economy and wonder where some of the back-ups for those are, too."

On March 5, 2009, Cramer responded to the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cramer: My Response To The White House |url=http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/cramer-my-response-white-house?page=2 |publisher=MainStreet |date=May 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309232629/http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/cramer-my-response-white-house?page=2 |archivedate=March 9, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "Huh? Backup? Look at the incredible decline in the stock market, in all indices, since the inauguration of the president, with the drop accelerating when the budget plan came to light because of the massive fear and indecision the document sowed: Raising taxes on the eve of what could be a second [[Great Depression]], destroying the profits in healthcare companies, tinkering with the mortgage deduction at a time when U.S. house price depreciation is behind much of the world's morass and certainly the devastation affecting our banks, and pushing an aggressive cap and trade program that could raise the price of energy for millions of people."

Cramer questioned criticism he received which he explained makes him "uncomfortable being in the crosshairs of columnists and comedians I enjoy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cramer Takes on the White House, Frank Rich and Jon Stewart |url=http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/cramer-takes-white-house-frank-rich-and-jon-stewart |publisher=MainStreet |date=September 3, 2009 |accessdate=September 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819231729/http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/cramer-takes-white-house-frank-rich-and-jon-stewart |archivedate=August 19, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cramer asked, "So, why after toiling in the cable wilderness for four years with ''Mad Money'' am I the target of the wrath of the Obama clan, and the darling, albeit surely momentary, of the Obama-critics? After all, my criticism of Obama's handling of the economic crisis is a lot less pointed than my withering August 2007 'They Know Nothing' meltdown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jim Cramer's famous rant about the "know nothing" Fed. |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=808465173&amp;play=1 |publisher=NBC |date= July 29, 2007|accessdate=July 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; against [[Ben Bernanke]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cramer: Bernanke, Wake Up |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=452808336 |publisher=NBC |date= March 8, 2007|accessdate=March 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the previous administration's handling of the economic crisis."

====Frank Rich====
Referring to March 8, 2009, charges leveled against Cramer by ''[[New York Times]]'' [[columnist]] [[Frank Rich]], Cramer said that he does not understand how Obama and his staff plan to raise taxes, institute cap-and-trade limitations and rework the health-care system all during a recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No Respect: Cramer Criticizes His Critics |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/29601234 |publisher=CNBC |date= October 3, 2009|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article says: "It isn't that Cramer disagrees with Obama's vision for the country – he even agrees with taxing the rich – but now is not the time to put those plans into action. The president needs to solve our housing, employment and financial problems, and only then turn his attention to health care and changing the mortgage deduction."

====Bear Stearns recommendation====

On the March 11, 2008, episode of Cramer's show ''Mad Money'', a viewer named Peter submitted the question "Should I be worried about [[Bear Stearns]] in terms of [[liquidity]] and get my money out of there?"  Cramer responded "No! No! No! Bear Stearns is not in trouble. If anything, they're more likely to be ''taken over''. Don't move your money from Bear."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/23575614 Mad Mail: Is Bear Stearns in Trouble?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Setting the Record Straight on Bear Stearns |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/29509036 |publisher=CNBC |date= March 4, 2009|accessdate=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 14, 2008, Bear Stearns stock fell 92% on news of a Fed bailout and $2/share takeover by JPMorgan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=4516500&amp;page=1|title=JPMorgan boosts offer for Bear Stearns to $10 a share|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 17, 2008, Cramer claimed his statements were made in regards to the liquidity of Bear Stearns brokerage accounts as opposed to Bear Stearns common stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Tom Brennan  |title=Cramer Was Right About Bear Stearns  |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/23678693/  |publisher=CNBC |date= March 17, 2008|accessdate=March 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cramer stated he was not recommending the common stock but allaying concerns about the account holder's liquidity held in a Bear Stearns brokerage account.  Cramer later wrote about the incident: "I did tell an emailer that his deposit in his account at Bear Stearns was safe, but through a clever sound bite, (Jon) Stewart, and subsequently (Frank) Rich—neither of whom have bothered to listen to the context of the pulled quote—pass off the notion of account safety as an out-and-out buy recommendation. The absurdity astounds me. If you called Mad Money and asked me about Citigroup, I would tell you that the common stock might be worthless, but I would never tell you to pull your money out of the bank because I was worried about its solvency. Your money is safe in Citi as I said it was in Bear. The fact that I was right rankles me even more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cramer |first=Jim |url=http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/cramer-takes-white-house-frank-rich-and-jon-stewart |title=Cramer Takes on the White House, Frank Rich and Jon Stewart &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Money/Investing |publisher=Mainstreet |date=March 10, 2009 |accessdate=April 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819231729/http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/cramer-takes-white-house-frank-rich-and-jon-stewart |archivedate=August 19, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Lewis, a journalist for the UK-based ''Evening Standard'', states that TheStreet.com listed Bear Stearns as a "Buy" at $62 per share on March 11, 2008, which was the same day as the caller's question and a day before the collapse of Bear Stearns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Michael Lewis  |title=Bear Stearns proves bank CEOs don't have a clue  |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-business/article-23466011-details/Bear+Stearns+proves+bank+CEOs+don't+have+a+clue+about+credit+crunch+crisis/article.do  |publisher=Evening Standard |date= March 27, 2008|accessdate=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, TheStreet.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stock Quote: BSC |title=TheStreet.com stock quote rating history |url=http://www.thestreet.com/quote/BSC.html |publisher=TheStreet.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427163000/http://www.thestreet.com/quote/BSC.html |archivedate=2009-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;—the web site quote that shows the ratings history for actual changes that Cramer makes—indicates that Cramer changed Bear Stearns rating to a "Sell" on February 5, 2008. On [[Jon Stewart's 2009 controversy with CNBC|his March 12, 2009 appearance]] on ''[[The Daily Show]]'', Cramer admitted he made mistakes on his Bear Stearns calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.indecisionforever.com/2009/03/13/jon-stewart-and-jim-cramer-the-extended-daily-show-interview/|title=Comedy Central Official Site - TV Show Full Episodes &amp; Funny Video Clips|work=Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jon Stewart====
{{Main|Jon Stewart's 2009 controversy with CNBC}}
On March 12, 2009, Cramer appeared on ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-march-12-2009/jim-cramer-pt--1 |title=Daily Show interview of Jim Cramer |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |date=March 12, 2009 |work=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart |publisher=comedycentral.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart reiterated earlier claims regarding the CNBC host's "silly and/or embarrassing and/or stupid financial observations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CNBC's Jim Cramer Responds to Jon Stewart's Response to CNBC's Jim Cramer |url=http://blog.indecisionforever.com/2009/03/10/cnbcs-jim-cramer-responds-to-jon-stewarts-response-to-cnbcs-jim-cramer/ |publisher=Comedy Central |date=March 10, 2009|accessdate=March 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he claimed CNBC shirked its journalistic duty by believing corporate lies, rather than being an investigative "powerful tool of illumination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apnews.myway.com/article/20090313/D96T3SJ83.html |title=Stewart hammers Cramer on 'The Daily Show' |accessdate=March 13, 2009 |date=March 13, 2009 |publisher=My Way News}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Cramer disagreed with Stewart on a few points, but acknowledged that he could have done a better job foreseeing the economic collapse: "We all should have seen it more." &lt;ref name="jim-cramer-unedited-interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=221517&amp;title=jim-cramer-unedited-interview|title=March 12, 2009: Jim Cramer Unedited Interview Pt. 2 |accessdate=March 12, 2009 |date=March 12, 2009 |publisher=Comedy Partners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart also discussed how short-selling was detrimental to the markets and investors. Cramer admitted to Stewart that short-selling was detrimental, stated his opposition to it, and claimed that he had never engaged in it, which contradicts earlier statements in which he described going short while managing a hedge fund. In a December 2006 interview from [[TheStreet.com]]'s "Wall Street Confidential" webcast Cramer said, "A lot of times when I was [[short (finance)|short]] at my hedge fund. ... When I was positioned short—meaning I needed it down—I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the [[futures contract|futures]]."&lt;ref name=kost/&gt; He said, "I will say this: I am trying to expose this stuff, exactly what you guys do, and I've been trying to get the regulators to look at it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/27850397 |title=Out with Cox, in with Uptick Rule |accessdate=Nov 21, 2008 |date=Nov 21, 2008 |publisher=CNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stewart played several video clips from 2006 where Cramer discussed the spreading of false rumors to drive down stock prices and encouraged short-selling by hedge funds as a means to generate returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/investing/insights/blog/archives/2009/03/brawl_street_jo.html |title=Brawl Street: Jon Stewart vs. Jim Cramer |accessdate=March 13, 2009 |date=March 13, 2009 |work=Business Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point in a clip from December 22, 2006, he said, "I would encourage anyone in a hedge fund to do it." He called it a very quick way to make money and very satisfying.  He continued, "By the way, no one else in the world would ever admit that, but I don't care, and again, I'm not gonna say it on TV."&lt;ref name="jim-cramer-unedited-interview" /&gt; Stewart responded, "I want the Jim Cramer on CNBC to protect me from that Jim Cramer."&lt;ref name="jim-cramer-unedited-interview" /&gt; Cramer again admitted that he can do better, and that he should try to change. The interview ended when Stewart pointedly suggested: "Maybe we can remove the 'financial expert' and the 'In Cramer We Trust' and start getting back to fundamentals on the reporting, as well, and I can go back to making fart noises and funny faces." Cramer responded: "I think we make that deal right here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=221518&amp;title=jim-cramer-unedited-interview|title=March 12, 2009: Jim Cramer Unedited Interview Pt. 3 |accessdate=March 12, 2009 |date=March 12, 2009 |publisher=Comedy Partners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response to pundits====
"The pundits," Cramer explained on March 9, 2009, in a MainStreet article, "who haven't paid attention to anything I have been saying or writing for the past 18 months are all over me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pundits Attack Cramer, But Don't Pay Attention To Facts |url=http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/cramer-takes-white-house-frank-rich-and-jon-stewart?page=4 |publisher=MainStreet |author=Jim Cramer |date=September 3, 2009 |accessdate=September 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601222826/http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/cramer-takes-white-house-frank-rich-and-jon-stewart?page=4 |archivedate=June 1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cramer said the pundits "won't engage in the merits of, say, favoring Tier&amp;nbsp;1 capital for the banks vs. common equity, or forbearing on the banks to work the situation out over time because the banks can be profitable if we have some patience. They just attack me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Do Pundits Attack Cramer? |url=http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/cramer-takes-white-house-frank-rich-and-jon-stewart?page=3 |publisher=MainStreet |author=Jim Cramer |date=September 3, 2009 |accessdate=September 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618013601/http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/cramer-takes-white-house-frank-rich-and-jon-stewart?page=3 |archivedate=June 18, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cramer suggested, "It's time to get serious. It's time to take the issue from the pundits and from the left and right, and put it where it belongs: serious non-ideological debate to put out the real firestorm, the collapse of the economy from Wall Street to Main Street and the ensuing Great Wealth Destruction for all."

====Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee====
Cramer appeared on CNBC on August 3, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cramer: Bernanke, Wake Up|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVXh4xM-Ww|website=YouTube|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said of the Fed Committee, "They're nuts.

'''Joseph Medill Patterson Albright''' (born 1937) is an American businessman and news publisher. He is the former husband of [[Madeleine Albright]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Life and career==
He was born to Jay Frederick Reeve (1893–1956), a lawyer, and his wife, née Josephine Medill Patterson (1913–1996), a reporter and airplane pilot.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |title= Josephine Patterson Albright, Colorful Journalist, Dies at 82 |date= January 18, 1996 |author= [[Lawrence Van Gelder]] |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/18/us/josephine-patterson-albright-colorful-journalist-dies-at-82.html|quote=Josephine Patterson Albright, who flew the mail, shot tigers in India, covered Chicago crime in journalism's colorful "Front Page" era, ran an Illinois dairy and pig farm, bred horses in Wyoming, wrote a column about her family and helped establish a foundation for journalists, died on Monday at her home in Woodstock, Vt. She was 82. A daughter, [[Alice Arlen]] of Manhattan, said the death was caused by complications after a stroke. |accessdate= December 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced in 1944, and his mother married painter [[Ivan Albright|Ivan Le Lorraine Albright]] in 1946. Joseph and his sister [[Alice Arlen|Alice]] were adopted by their mother's second husband, and their surname became "Albright". Two additional children were born to this second marriage, Adam and Blandina (known as "Dina").&lt;ref name=MM&gt;{{Citation | last1  = McKinney | first1 = Megan | title     = The Magnificent Medills | publisher = HarperCollins | place     = New York, New York | isbn  = 978-0-06-178223-7 | year    = 2011 | pages = 301–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albright is the scion of a media empire, the grandson and namesake of [[Joseph Medill Patterson]], founder of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' who had rivaled [[William Randolph Hearst]] in the 1930s. His great-great grandfather, [[Joseph Medill]], owned the [[Chicago Tribune]] and had been elected [[mayor]] of [[Chicago]]. His aunt, [[Alicia Patterson]], founded ''[[Newsday]]''.

Albright attended [[Williams College]]. He met [[Madeleine Albright|Madeleine Jana Korbel]] when she spent a summer working at the [[Denver Post]]. They married in 1959 after Madeleine's graduation from [[Wellesley College]]. They had three children: twin girls, Anne and Alice (born 1961), and youngest daughter Katie. After he left Madeleine for another woman, the couple divorced in 1982. Albright remarried Marcia Kunstel; they own [[Flat Creek Ranch]] in [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

'''Maurice Wertheim''' (February 16, 1886 – May 27, 1950) was an American [[investment banker]], [[chess]] player, chess patron, [[environmentalist]], and [[philanthropist]].  Wertheim founded [[Wertheim &amp; Co.]] in 1927.

==Biography==
Born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=  |first=  |authorlink=   |title= Maurice Wertheim: Investment Banker and Art Curator  |publisher=[[Harvard University]]|date= |url=http://dighist.fas.harvard.edu/courses/2016/HUM11c/exhibits/show/cultural-space/maurice-wertheim--investment-b  |accessdate=November 27, 2018|quote=The Jewish businessman’s personal interests ranged from philanthropy to nature conservancy, and Wertheim was an extremely passionate chess player }}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Jacob Wertheim of [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and his wife, Hannah Frank of [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], Wertheim was educated at the [[Dwight School|Sachs School]] in [[New York City|New York]].  He then graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1906 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1907.  In his freshman year, he lived in [[List of Harvard dormitories#Matthews Hall|Matthews Hall]] in [[Harvard Yard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~dorms/index.cgi?name=wertheim&amp;grad=&amp;year=&amp;dorm=-+Any+-&amp;room= |title=Dorm History Search |publisher=Harvard Computer Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began work at his father's firm, the United Cigar Manufacturers Company.  He would later inherit nearly half a million dollars from his father, due to his success with the company.  In 1915, he entered into a career as an [[investment banker]] in New York, and four years later would become a firm partner of [[Hallgarten &amp; Company]].  He founded his own firm [[Wertheim &amp; Co.|Wertheim &amp; Company]] in 1927, developing a very successful business in [[mergers and acquisitions]], and becoming wealthy in the process. During [[World War II]], he served as a [[one-dollar salary|dollar-a-year man]] on the War Production Board in the administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arnold |last=Denker |authorlink=Arnold Denker |year=2003 |title=The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories |isbn=978-1843820802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wertheim served on various boards and as a trustee for various organizations. He was trustee of the [[UJA-Federation of New York|Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York]], [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]], and [[The Nation]].  He also served as president of the [[American Jewish Committee]].

Wertheim was an amateur chess player and patron of the game.  He served as the president of the [[Manhattan Chess Club]], which he assisted financially and took an avid interest in playing [[correspondence chess]].  He financed the 1941 [[U.S. Chess Championship]] match between [[Samuel Reshevsky]] and [[I.A. Horowitz]], which was won by Reshevsky.

Wertheim conceived of the idea for the 1946 chess match between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Moscow]] and persuaded the [[U.S. State Department]] that it would make a difference in thawing the [[Cold War]].  He paid for all the costs, and personally led the team at the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brookhavensouthhaven.org/history/Wertheim/WertheimDegasToMatisse.htm  |title=Maurice Wertheim - Degas to Matisse |publisher=Brookhaven/South Haven Hamlets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also actively interested in art, fishing, nature conservancy, and theater.  He was an active supporter of the [[Theatre Guild|New York Theatre Guild]], where he later served as director overseeing the Guild's operations.  He acquired {{convert|1800|acre|km2}} of land along the [[Carmans River]] on eastern [[Long Island]] for personal use to conserve [[waterfowl]] and for [[hunting]].  In 1947, Wertheim and his then wife, Cecile, donated the entire stretch of land to the United States government for "the American people"; the land would eventually become known as the [[Wertheim National Wildlife Refuge]].

Wertheim amassed a notable collection of [[Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionist]] works that contained many famous masterpieces, including paintings and sculptures by [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1950/6/9/fogg-gets-fabulous-art-collection-18/&lt;/ref&gt; In his will, he arranged for the donation of his collection of [[France|French]] [[Impressionist]] paintings to the [[Fogg Art Museum]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/study-and-research/publications/detail.dot?id=22777 |title=Harvard Art Museums/ Publications |publisher=Harvard Art Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death from a heart attack in 1950, a memorial Maurice Wertheim chess tournament was organized in 1951 in New York in his memory; it was won by [[Samuel Reshevsky]].  In 1963, Wertheim's daughter, Barbara, established the Wertheim Study Room in the [[New York Public Library]] in honor of her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypl.org/locations/stephen-schwarzman-building/wertheim-study |title=Wertheim Study |publisher=New York Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1909, he married Alma Morgenthau,&lt;ref name=BrookHaven&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brookhavensouthhaven.org/hamletpeople/tng/getperson.php?personID=I7210&amp;tree=hamlet |title=Maurice Wertheim, 1886-1950 |publisher=Brookhaven/South Haven Hamlets}}&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=  |first=  |authorlink=   |title= Mrs. Wertheim to Marry Paul L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15661">The '''National Microbiology Laboratory''' ('''NML''') is part of the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Branch of the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] (PHAC), the agency of the Government of Canada that is responsible for public health, health emergency preparedness and response, and infectious and chronic disease control and prevention.

NML is located in several sites across the country including the [[Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health]] (CSCHAH) in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], also home to the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]’s [[National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease]]. This modern state-of-the-art infectious disease laboratory facility houses the only [[Containment Level 4]] (also known as [[Biosafety Level 4]]) operational laboratories in Canada. With maximum containment, scientists are able to work safely with pathogens ranging from the most common to the most serious including [[Ebolavirus|Ebola]], [[Marburg virus|Marburg]] and [[Lassa fever]].

NML has a second site in Winnipeg, the JC Wilt Infectious Disease Research Centre on Logan Avenue which serves as a hub for HIV research and diagnostics in Canada. The three other primary sites include locations in Guelph, St. Hyacinthe and Lethbridge.

== History ==

The National Microbiology Laboratory was preceded by the Bureau of Microbiology which was originally part of the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control of Health Canada in Ottawa. In the 1980s, Health Canada identified both the need to replace existing laboratory space that was reaching the end of its lifespan and the need for Containment Level 4 space in the country. Around the same time, Agriculture Canada (prior to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency being formed) also identified the need for new laboratory space including high-containment. Numerous benefits were identified for housing both laboratories in one building and Winnipeg was chosen as the site; an announcement to that effect was made in October 1987.

After some debate, the spot chosen for the site was a city works yard near to the Health Sciences Centre (a major teaching hospital), the University of Manitoba’s medical school, and other life science organizations. Construction of the facility that came to be named the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health (often referred to locally as “the Virology Lab”) began with an official ground-breaking in December 1992. The joint venture design team of Toronto-based Dunlop Architects and Winnipeg-based Smith Carter Architects and Engineers Inc. visited 30 laboratories to seek best practices in containment and design. Construction was largely complete by the end of 1997 with the first programs beginning in the spring of 1998 and all laboratories coming on line after that. The official opening took place in June 1999.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;[https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071213074113/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/1999/1999_81_e.html News Release].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) was formed in 2004 &lt;ref name="two"&gt;[https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071213075940/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/2004/2004_47_e.html News Release]&lt;/ref&gt; to provide a stronger focus on public health and emergency preparedness in the country. It is a member of the federal Health Portfolio (along with Health Canada, the Canadian Institute of Health Research, and other organizations).

== Containment ==

Human pathogens are classified into risk groups.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;[https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/canadian-biosafety-standards-guidelines/handbook-second-edition.html Canadian Biosafety Handbook, Second Edition 2016 ].&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria to determine the group includes the level of risk to the health of a person or to public health, as well as the likelihood that the human pathogen will actually cause disease in a human, and whether treatment and preventative measures are available. It can depend on the type of work being done as to which level of containment is needed for pathogens from specific risk groups; as an example, culturing (or growing) a virus or bacterium requires higher containment than some diagnostic tests.

NML operates Containment Level 2, 3 and 4 laboratories. In human health infectious disease laboratories, the design and construction of the facility, the engineering controls, and the training and techniques of staff are all focused on protecting lab workers, containing the pathogens, and preventing contamination of materials to ensure accurate diagnosis and research. All of these factors vary depending on the level of containment.

The vast majority (87.7%) of NML’s lab space is Containment Level 2 (CL2). This is the same type of laboratory found in doctors' offices, hospitals and universities. In a Level 2 lab, work with infectious materials is done inside a biosafety cabinet (BSC) and appropriate personal protective gear is worn relative to activities (gloves, eye protection, lab coats, gowns, etc.). Risk Group 2 pathogens worked with in Level 2 can cause disease but are not a serious hazard and they are often circulating in the community. Environmental contamination must be minimized by the use of hand washing sinks and decontamination facilities such as autoclaves. Examples include E-coli; whooping cough; and seasonal influenza.

NML also has Containment Level 3 (CL3) laboratories (8.6% of lab space). Risk Group 3 pathogens may be transmitted by the airborne route, often need only a low infectious dose to produce effects, and can cause serious or life-threatening disease. CL3 emphasizes additional primary and secondary barriers to minimize the release of infectious organisms into the immediate laboratory and the environment. Additional features to prevent transmission of CL3 organisms are appropriate respiratory protection, HEPA filtration of exhausted laboratory air, and strictly controlled laboratory access. Examples include tuberculosis; West Nile virus; and pandemic H1N1 influenza.

A small percentage of laboratory space (3.6%) is devoted to Containment Level 4 (CL4) at NML. These agents have the potential for aerosol transmission, often have a low infectious dose and produce very serious and often fatal disease; there is no licensed treatment or vaccine available. This level of containment represents an isolated unit independent of other areas. CL4 emphasizes maximum containment of the infectious agent by completely sealing the facility perimeter with confirmation by negative pressure testing; isolation of the researcher from the pathogen by an enclosed positive pressure suit; and decontamination of air and all other materials. Examples include Ebola; Nipah; Marburg; and 1918 pandemic influenza.

== Structure ==

NML programs are housed in several facilities across the country. Two of these facilities are in proximity to each other in Winnipeg: The Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health on Arlington Street and the J.C. Wilt Infectious Diseases Research Centre on Logan Avenue. The other facilities are located in Guelph, ON; St. Hyacinthe, QC and Lethbridge, AB.

NML is divided into five main laboratory divisions which are supported by scientific and administrative services. The primary NML divisions are:

'''Bacterial Pathogens''' - focussing on bacterial diseases such as tuberculosis and antibiotic resistant organisms.

'''Enteric Diseases''' - focussing on food and water-borne pathogens including E.coli and Salmonella.

'''Viral Diseases''' - addressing a range of viral diseases, including hepatitis and other blood-borne pathogens, respiratory viruses and viral exanthemata, such as measles.

'''Zoonotic Diseases and Special Pathogens''' - dealing with viral, bacterial and rickettsial zoonoses (diseases transmitted to humans from other species), such as West Nile Virus and Lyme disease, along with risk group 4 agents such as Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever viruses.

'''HIV and Retrovirology''' - providing laboratory services and scientific expertise relating to HIV and emerging retroviruses.

'''The Science Technology Core and Services''' Division works with these divisions to provide technological approaches, including genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics.

There is also the '''Public Health Risk Sciences Division''', which is a specialized resource that provides scientific knowledge and [[solution]]s to better assess public health risks and enable decisions, with specific attention to infectious disease threats transmitted from food, the animals, or the physical environment.

These science-based divisions are complemented and supported by numerous other units that ensure their ongoing operations such as the Office of Science Planning, Program Support and Services, Scientific Informatic Services, Science Support and Client Services, Surveillance and References Services, the Facility and Property Management Division, and the Biorisk and Occupational Safety Services Division. NML also funds the National Reference Centre for Parasitology in Montreal and has a Laboratory Liaison Technical Officer in most provincial labs.

== Workforce ==

NML employs scientists (MD, PhD, and DVM), biologists, and laboratory technicians, but it also includes informatics specialists, biosafety experts, specialized operations and maintenance staff, and administrative staff, among others. In total, there are approximately 600 staff members as of 2016.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

== Accomplishments ==

NML is renowned{{cn|date=July 2018}} for its work on a broad spectrum of infectious diseases from seasonal influenza to Ebola and its accomplishments are too many to detail.

Some recent examples of the work done by NML include their involvement in the response to the West African Ebola outbreak. For a period of about 18 months, teams from NML travelled to West Africa to aid in the diagnostics during the outbreak. They worked closely with the World Health Organization and Médecins sans frontières to ensure people were properly diagnosed so that they could be properly cared for and isolated from others to stop the spread. Also during this outbreak, a promising vaccine and treatment for Ebola that were developed at NML, in conjunction with collaborators, were fast tracked into clinical trials so that they could get to the people that needed it as soon as possible.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Another accomplishment was the response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. In April 2009, the Mexican national lab approached NML for assistance with identifying a respiratory virus that was causing outbreaks in Mexico. NML was able to quickly identify the new virus and recognize that it matched the virus that was beginning to circulate in the U.S. As the lead laboratory in Canada, NML rapidly developed diagnostic tests and equipped provincial labs to be able to test for the new virus.  NML also assisted Mexico by providing additional testing and sent staff to their national laboratory to enable to help them set up their own testing protocols.

In the international laboratory sector, NML has developed different types of mobile labs: a lab-truck, a lab-trailer, and a “lab in a suitcase.” The lab-truck is generally used for in-country deployments at high-profile events such as the 2010 Olympics, the lab-trailer is used for international large-scale events where there may be a threat of bio-terrorism or other deliberate acts involving infectious agents, and the lab in a suitcase is frequently used in remote areas of the world with little available infrastructure. An example would be the multiple deployments over the years to combat outbreaks of Ebola in Africa. This model was adopted by many other countries during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

NML houses the secretariats for both the Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network (CPHLN) and the Global Health Security Action Group – Laboratory Network (GHSAG-LN). The role of CPHLN is to provide a forum for public health laboratory leaders to share knowledge. The GHSAG-LN network’s goals are to coordinate the diagnostic capabilities of all participants and contribute to disease surveillance around the world.

The Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence (CNPHI) is an innovation developed by NML staff. It is a secure web-based system that compiles information from various surveillance systems and issues alerts to users. More than 4,000 public health officials across Canada now subscribe to it. CNPHI tools assist in determining the existence or extent of an outbreak through the recognition of related cases across jurisdictions.

== Directors ==

From 2000 to 2014, Dr. [[Frank Plummer]] was the Scientific Director General of the National Microbiology Laboratory. Under Dr. Plummer's guidance, the NML developed into one of the world's premier institutions in the research, detection, and response to global infectious disease and bio-security threats.

Dr. Plummer received his medical degree from the University of Manitoba in 1976. Between 1984 and 2001, Dr. Plummer lived in Nairobi, Kenya where he spearheaded the development of the world renowned "Kenya AIDS Control Program," established by the Universities of Manitoba and Nairobi. This HIV epidemiological work was central to global understanding of the risk factors for HIV transmission and how to prevent its spread. Dr. Plummer was the first to reveal that heterosexual women could also be infected with HIV/AIDS and that a cohort of Nairobi sex workers had a natural immunity to HIV/AIDS. This latter discovery suggested the possibility that a vaccine could eventually be developed.

Dr. Plummer stepped down as the NML’s Scientific Director General to take the position as senior adviser to the Agency's Chief Public Health Officer in 2014. He continues to be a distinguished professor at the University of Manitoba and a Canada Research Chair.

In 2015, Dr. Matthew Gilmour became the Scientific Director General of the National Microbiology Laboratory and the Laboratory for Foodborne Zoonoses. Dr. Gilmour spearheaded the partnership that brought these two laboratories together under the National Microbiology Laboratory umbrella. He was previously the Chief, Enteric Diseases and subsequently the Program Director, Bacteriology and Enteric Diseases at the NML.

Dr. Gilmour has won a number of scientific awards including Canadian Society of Microbiologists’ Canadian Graduate Student Microbiologist of the Year Award; the Public Health Agency of Canada’s Most Promising Researcher Merit Award and Dr. Andrés Petrasovits Public Health Merit Award; and Health Canada’s Excellence Award in Collaborative Leadership and Award for Excellence in Science. Dr. Gilmour continues to be an Assistant Professor at the University of Manitoba’s Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases as well as the Secretary Treasurer of the Canadian Association for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (CACMID).

'''Oded David "O.D." Kobo''' ([[Hebrew]]: קובו עודד) is an Internet [[entrepreneur]] and businessman. He is the founder and [[chairman]] of PIR Equities, a [[private equity firm]].&lt;ref name="PIR"&gt;{{cite web|title=PIR Equities Team|url=https://www.pirequities.com/team|website=PIR Equities|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kobo grew up in Hong Kong, born to [[Bebo Kobo|Eliezer "Bebo"]] and Ruth Kobo.&lt;ref name="PIR"/&gt; He is the eldest son of Bebo's six children.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sadeh|first1=Shuki|title=Who Is Oded Kobo?

==Career==
&lt;!-- {{In use|section|several days to address issues identified in an [[meta:OTRS|OTRS]] request|time=11:09, 28 March 2017 (UTC)}} --&gt; 
Kobo's business interests have ranged from technology to property to private equity with nearly US$1 billion in exits.&lt;ref name="genius"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000407189|title=איש העסקים עודד קובו גייס כמיליארד דולר להשקעות בתחום המדיה (Businessman Oded Kobo raised about US$1 billion for media investments)|last=גאוני|first=יעל|date=14 December 2008|work=Globes|publisher=Bloomberg|language=Hebrew|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kobo started his career at the age of twenty-one by licensing patented technology to the online lottery industry with e-Lottery (once the domain holder of Lottery.com). He later established several China based investment firms namely KGIM and SinoSheen of which both were partnered with the Prime Minister of Qatar [[Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani]]. KGIM was acquired in 2010 for US$120 million by East River Capital (a subsidiary of the [[Qatar Investment Authority]]) and SinoSheen had invested in companies such as [[Tencent]], [[Netease]] and [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]] pre-IPO before it was too acquired in 2011 for US$52 million.&lt;ref name="inc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/ilya-pozin/7-months-from-launch-music-messenger-closes-30-million-series-b-round-led-by-rom.html|title=7 Months From Launch, Music Messenger Closes $30 Million Funding Round|date=22 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Kobo founded PIR Equities, an employee owned [[private equity firm]]. The firm raised US$980 million that year to pursue [[value investing|value based investments]] within the [[financial services]], technology and real estate industries.&lt;ref name="genius" /&gt;

In 2014, Camden Market Holdings the proprietor of landmark properties such as the Camden Market, Stables Market and Camden Lock Developments in Camden, London was acquired for $680 million by billionaire businessman [[Teddy Sagi]] of [[Playtech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rochvarger|first1=Michael|title=Israeli Tycoon buys Camden|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-israeli-buys-london-s-camden-market-1.5334599|publisher=Haaretz|date=March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kobo invested in Camden Market Holdings via PIR Equites and was a member of the board of directors alongside [[Bebo Kobo]], [[Richard Caring]] and Chelsfield Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teddy Sagi buys London's Camden Stables Market at $664 Million|url=http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2014/03/16/teddy-sagi-buys-londons-camden-stables-market-in-deal-valued-at-us664-million/|publisher=Jewish Business News|date=March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2014, Kobo sold Pheed - a mobile pay-per-view technology to [[Carlos Slim]] and [[American Movil]] for US$40 million.&lt;ref name="Pozin"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ilyapozin/2014/09/18/launch-to-exit-in-18-months-pheed-acquired-for-40m/|title=Launch To Exit In 18 Months: Pheed Acquired For $40M|last=Pozin|first=Ilya|date=28 September 2014|work=Forbes|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction was brokered by Moshe Hogeg and [[Mobli]] Media.

In 2015, Kobo established S Group, a technology venture builder, with partners [[Roman Abramovich]] and Gee Roberson, the former Chairman of Geffen Records who invested US$30 million in the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-roman-abramovich-1001029660|title=Abramovich leads $30m round in OD Kobo's music start-up - Globes English|website=Globes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inc.com"/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6538989/music-messenger-app-nicki-minaj-david-guetta-gee-roberson-roman-abramovich|title=Music Messenger, the App That Nicki Minaj and David Guetta Invested In, Is Exploding -- Here's Why|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, it was reported first in the [[Huffington Post]] that two properties from their portfolio had been sold to a consortium of Chinese investors led by [[Ding Lei]] for US$32 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2016/09/27/roman-abramovich-oded-kobos-shellanoo-sell-anonymous-app-blindspot-and-mrc-app-to-chinese-for-32-million/|title=Roman Abramovich, Oded Kobo’s Shellanoo sell anonymous app BLINDSPOT and MrC app to Chinese for $32 Million|date=27 September 2016|website=Jewish Business News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kobo is one of the founders of [[Music Messenger]] an online music and audio distribution platform launched in 2014 partnered with [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Will.I.Am]], [[Avicii]], [[Sebastian Ingross]], [[Tiesto]], Dave Holmes (manager of [[Coldplay]]), [[Benny Andersson]], and [[David Guetta]].

Kobo had led several failed attempts to purchase MTV Networks from National Amusements in 2008, as well as an attempt to purchase Golan Telecom in Israel in 2016, which was highly criticized by the press and caused a public backlash resulting to Kobo withdrawing his IPO  on the [[TASE]] for Shellanoo Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?fbdid=1001127856|title=רומן אברמוביץ' ועודד קובו מתעניינים בגולן טלקום - גלובס|website=Globes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?fbdid=1000407189|title=איש העסקים עודד קובו גייס כמיליארד דולר להשקעות בתחום המדיה - גלובס|website=Globes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-roman-abramovich-eyes-golan-telecom-acquisition-report-1001127974|title=Roman Abramovich offers to buy Golan Telecom - report - Globes English|website=Globes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://exithub.com/od-kobos-high-profile-shellanoo-incubator-abruptly-cancels-tel-aviv-ipo/

'''Retail''' is the process of selling [[consumer goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] to customers through multiple [[distribution channel|channels of distribution]] to earn a profit. '''Retailers''' satisfy demand identified through a [[supply chain]]. The term "retailer" is typically applied where a service provider fills the small orders of a large number of individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a small number of [[wholesale]], [[corporate]] or government clientele. [[Shopping]] generally refers to the act of [[Trade|buying]] products. Sometimes this is done to obtain [[final goods]], including necessities such as food and clothing; sometimes it takes place as a [[recreation]]al activity. Recreational shopping often involves [[window shopping]] and browsing: it does not always result in a purchase.

Retail markets and shops have a very ancient history, dating back to antiquity. Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant [[peddler]]s. Over the centuries, retail shops were transformed from little more than "rude booths" to the sophisticated shopping malls of the modern era.

Most modern retailers typically make a variety of [[corporate strategy|strategic level]] decisions including the type of [[retail shop|store]], the [[market (economics)|market]] to be served, the optimal [[product (business)|product]] assortment, [[customer service]], supporting services and the store's overall market positioning. Once the strategic retail plan is in place, retailers devise the retail mix which includes product, price, place, promotion, personnel and presentation. In the [[digital age]], an increasing number of retailers are seeking to reach broader markets by selling through multiple channels, including both [[bricks and mortar store|bricks and mortar]] and [[Online shopping|online retailing]]. Digital technologies are also changing the way that [[consumer]]s pay for goods and services. Retailing support services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, stylist services and a range of other supporting services.

Retail shops occur in a diverse range of types and in many different contexts&amp;nbsp;– from [[strip mall|strip shopping centres]] in [[residential area|residential streets]] through to large, indoor [[shopping mall]]s. [[Shopping streets]] may restrict traffic to pedestrians only. Sometimes a shopping street has a partial or full [[roof]] to create a more comfortable shopping environment – protecting customers from various types of weather conditions such as extreme temperatures, winds or [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Forms of non-shop retailing include online retailing (a type of '''electronic-commerce''' used for '''business-to-consumer''' ('''B2C''') transactions) and [[mail order]].

==Etymology==
Retail comes from the Old French word ''tailler'', which means "to cut off, clip, pare, divide" in terms of tailoring (1365). It was first recorded as a noun with the meaning of a "sale in small quantities" in 1433 (from the Middle French ''retail'', "piece cut off, shred, scrap, paring").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|retail|accessdate=2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the French, the word, ''retail'', in both Dutch and German, also refers to the sale of small quantities of items.

==Definition and explanation==

Retail refers to the activity of reselling. A retailer is any person or organisation is a reseller who sells goods or services directly to consumers or end-users.&lt;ref&gt;The Free Dictionary, &lt;Online: https://www.thefreedictionary.com/retail&lt;/ref&gt; Some retailers may sell to business customers, and such sales are termed ''non-retail activity.'' In some jurisdictions or regions, legal definitions of retail specify that at least 80 percent of sales activity must be to end-users.&lt;ref&gt;Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C. Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S. Niininen, O. and Casidy, R., ''Marketing Principles'', 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018,  pp 449-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Retailing often occurs in retail stores or service establishments, but may also occur through direct selling such as through vending machines, door-to-door sales or electronic channels.&lt;ref&gt;Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C. Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S. Niininen, O. and Casidy, R., ''Marketing Principles'', 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018,  p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the idea of retail is often associated with the purchase of goods, the term may be applied to service-providers that sell to consumers. Retail service providers include retail banking, tourism, insurance, private healthcare, private education, private security firms, legal firms, publishers, public transport and others. For example, a tourism provider might have a retail division that books travel and accommodation for consumers plus a wholesale division that purchases blocks of accommodation, hospitality, transport and sightseeing which are subsequently packaged into a holiday tour for sale to retail travel agents.

Some retailers badge their stores as "wholesale outlets" offering "wholesale prices." While this practice may encourage consumers to imagine that they have access to lower prices, while being prepared to trade-off reduced prices for cramped in-store environments, in a strict legal sense, a store that sells the majority of its merchandise direct to consumers, is defined as a retailer rather than a wholesaler. Different jurisdictions set parameters for the ratio of consumer to business sales that define a retail business.

===Retailing in antiquity===
[[File:Traiano mercati.jpg|thumb|Marketplace at Trajan's Forum, the earliest known example of permanent retail shopfronts]] 
Retail markets have existed since ancient times. Archaeological evidence for trade, probably involving barter systems, dates back more than 10,000 years. As civilizations grew, barter was replaced with retail trade involving coinage. Selling and buying is thought to have emerged in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) in around the 7th millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian D. G.; Shaw, Eric H. (2006). "A History of Marketing Thought", ''Handbook of Marketing.'' Weitz, Barton A.; Wensley, Robin (eds), Sage, p. 41, {{ISBN|1-4129-2120-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gharipour points to evidence of primitive shops and trade centres in Sialk Hills in Kashan (6000 BCE), Catalk Huyuk in modern-day Turkey (7,500–5,700 BCE), Jericho (2600 BCE) and Susa (4000 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Gharipour, M., "The Culture and Politics of Commerce", in ''The Bazaar in the Islamic City: Design, Culture, and History'', Mohammad Gharipour (ed.), New York, The American University in Cairo Press, 2012 p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Open air, public markets were known in ancient Babylonia, Assyria, Phoenicia and Egypt. These markets typically occupied a place in the [[town centre|town's centre]]. Surrounding the market, skilled artisans, such as metal-workers and leather workers, occupied permanent premises in alleys that led to the open market-place. These artisans may have sold wares directly from their premises, but also prepared goods for sale on market days.&lt;ref&gt;Bintliff, J., "Going to Market in Antiquity", In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums'', Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, pp. 209–50&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Greece]] markets operated within the [[agora]], an open space where, on market days, goods were displayed on mats or temporary stalls.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, D.B., ''An Ancient Shopping Center: The Athenian Agora'', ASCSA, 1993   pp 19-21&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Roman Empire|ancient Rome]], trade took place in the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]].&lt;ref&gt;McGeough, K.M., ''The Romans: New Perspectives'', ABC-CLIO, 2004, pp 105-106&lt;/ref&gt; Rome had two forums; the [[Roman forum|Forum Romanum]] and [[Trajan's Forum]]. The latter was a vast expanse, comprising multiple buildings with shops on four levels.&lt;ref&gt;Holleran, C., ''Shopping in Ancient Rome: The Retail Trade in the Late Republic and the Late Republic and the Principate'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shop-front.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, P., ''Shopping Environments'', Elsevier, Oxford, 2006, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In antiquity, exchange involved [[direct selling]] via [[merchant]]s or [[peddler]]s and [[barter]]ing systems were commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;

These forerunners of travelling salesmen roamed from village to village bartering stone axes in exchange for salt or other goods (Dixon, 1975).

The [[Phoenicia]]ns, noted for their seafaring skills, plied their ships across the Mediterranean, becoming a major trading power by the 9th century BCE. The Phoenicians imported and exported wood, textiles, glass and produce such as wine, oil, dried fruit and nuts. Their trading skills necessitated a network of colonies along the Mediterranean coast, stretching from modern day Crete through to Tangiers and onto Sardinia&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, M., "Trade in the Phoenician World", ''Ancient History Encyclopedia'', 1 April 2016, &lt;Online: http://www.ancient.eu/article/881&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Phoenicians not only traded in tangible goods, but were also instrumental in transporting culture. The Phoenician's extensive trade networks necessitated considerable book-keeping and correspondence. In around 1500 BCE, the Phoenicians developed a consonantal alphabet which was much easier to learn that the complex scripts used in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Phoenician traders and merchants were largely responsible for spreading their alphabet around the region.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1996) pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenician inscriptions have been found in [[archaeological]] sites at a number of former Phoenician cities and [[colonies]] around the Mediterranean, such as [[Byblos]] (in present-day [[Lebanon]]) and [[Carthage]] in [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/111499sci-alphabet-origin.html|title=Discovery of Egyptian Inscriptions Indicates an Earlier Date for Origin of the Alphabet|website=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2013-01-02 Grand Bazaar, Istanbul 04.jpg|thumb|left|Grand Bazaar, Istanbul (interior). Established in 1455, it is thought to be the oldest continuously operating covered market]]

In the Graeco-Roman world, the market primarily served the local peasantry. Local producers, who were generally poor, would sell small surpluses from their individual farming activities, purchase minor farm equipment and also buy a few luxuries for their homes. Major producers such as the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm-gates, obviating the producers' need to attend local markets. The very wealthy landowners managed their own distribution, which may have involved exporting and importing. The nature of export markets in antiquity is well documented in ancient sources and archaeological case studies.&lt;ref&gt;Bintliff, J., "Going to Market in Antiquity", In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums'', Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans preferred to purchase goods from specific places: oysters from Londinium, cinnamon from a specific mountain in Arabia, and these place-based preferences stimulated trade throughout Europe and the middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Paquet-Byrne, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping'', ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, 2003, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; Markets were also important centres of social life.&lt;ref&gt;ar, F., "The World of the Golden Ass", ''Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 71, 1981, pp. 63–67&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of retailing and marketing in England and Europe has been extensively studied, but less is known about developments elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Southerton, D. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture'', Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2011 p. 888&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, recent research suggests that China exhibited a rich history of early retail systems.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, K. and Reid., S., "The Birth of the Brand: 4000 years of Branding", ''Business History'', Vol. 50, 2008. pp. 419–32.&lt;/ref&gt; From as early as 200 BCE, Chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family, place names and product quality, and the use of government imposed product branding was used between 600 and 900 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, G.M. and Bengtsson. A. "A Brief History of Branding in China", ''Journal of Macromarketing'', Vol, 30, no. 3, 2010, pp. 210–21&lt;/ref&gt; Eckhart and Bengtsson have argued that during the Song Dynasty (960–1127), Chinese society developed a consumerist culture, where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, G.M. and Bengtsson. A. "A Brief History of Branding in China", ''Journal of Macromarketing'', Vol, 30, no. 3, 2010, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of a [[consumer culture]] led to the commercial investment in carefully managed [[company image]], [[signage#RETAIL SIGNAGE|retail signage]], symbolic brands, [[trademark#Registration|trademark protection]] and sophisticated brand concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, G.M. and Bengtsson. A. "A Brief History of Branding in China", ''Journal of Macromarketing'', Vol, 30, no. 3, 2010, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retailing in Medieval Europe===

[[File:The Cross and Rows, Chester, Cheshire, England, ca. 1895.jpg|thumb|right|The Row, Chester, Cheshire, England, c. 1895; a unique medieval shopping arcade]]

In Medieval England and Europe, relatively few permanent shops were to be found; instead customers walked into the tradesman's workshops where they discussed purchasing options directly with tradesmen. In 13th century London, mercers and haberdashers were known to exist and grocers sold "miscellaneous small wares as well as spices and medicines" but fish and other perishables were sold through markets, costermongers, hucksters, peddlers or other type of itinerant vendor.&lt;ref&gt;Thrupp, S.L., ''The Merchant Class of Medieval London, 1300–1500'', pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

In the more populous cities, a small number of shops were beginning to emerge by the 13th century. In [[Chester]], a medieval covered shopping arcade represented a major innovation that attracted shoppers from many miles around. Known as "[[Chester Rows|The Rows"]] this medieval shopping arcade is believed to be the first of its kind in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, N. and Hubbard, E., ''The Buildings of England: Cheshire'' Penguin, 1978, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments of Chester's Medieval Row, which is believed to date to the mid-13th century, can still be found in Cheshire.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, P., ''Building Chester'', Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th or 14th century, another arcade with several shops was recorded at ''Drapery Row'' in Winchester.&lt;ref&gt;Keene, D. and Rumble, A. R., ''Survey of Medieval Winchester'', (Part 1), Oxford University Press, 1985, p. 578&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of street names such as ''Drapery Row'', ''Mercer's Lane'' and ''[[Ironmonger Lane]]'' in the medieval period suggests that permanent shops were becoming more commonplace.

Medieval shops had little in common with their modern equivalent. As late as the 16th century, London's shops were described as little more than "rude booths" and their owners "bawled as loudly as the itinerants."&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C., ''London'', Vol. 5, 1841, Knight &amp; Co, London, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Shopfronts typically had a front door with two wider openings on either side, each covered with shutters. The shutters were designed to open so that the top portion formed a canopy while the bottom was fitted with legs so that it could serve as a shopboard.&lt;ref name="Conlin, J. 2013"&gt;Conlin, J., ''Tales of Two Cities: Paris, London and the Birth of the Modern City'', Atlantic Books, 2013, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Cox and Dannehl suggest that the Medieval shopper's experience was very different. Glazed windows, which were rare during the medieval period, and did not become commonplace until the eighteenth century, meant that shop interiors were dark places. Outside the markets, goods were rarely out on display and the service counter was unknown. Shoppers had relatively few opportunities to inspect the merchandise prior to consumption. Many stores had openings onto the street from which they served customers.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England'', Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the major cities, most consumable purchases were made through markets or fairs. Markets were held daily in the more populous towns and cities or weekly in the more sparsely populated rural districts. Markets sold fresh produce; fruit, vegetables, baked goods, meat, poultry, fish and some ready to eat foodstuffs; while fairs operated on a periodic cycle and were almost always associated with a religious festival.&lt;ref&gt;''Gazetteer of Markets and Fairs in England and Wales to 1516'', The List and Index Society, no. 32, 2003, &lt;Online: http://www.history.ac.uk/cmh/gaz/gazweb2.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Fairs sold non-perishables such as farm tools, homewares, furniture, rugs and ceramics. Market towns dotted the medieval European landscape while itinerant vendors supplied less populated areas or hard-to-reach districts. Peddlers and other itinerant vendors operated alongside other types of retail for centuries. The political philosopher, [[John Stuart Mill]] compared the convenience of markets/fairs to that of the itinerant peddlers:

:"The contrivance of fairs and markets was early had recourse to, where consumers and producers might periodically meet, without any intermediate agency; and this plan answers tolerably well for many articles, especially agricultural produce … but were inconvenient to buyers who have other occupations, and do not live in the immediate vicinity … and the wants of the consumers must either be provided for so long beforehand, or must remain so long unsupplied, that even before the resources of society admitted of the establishment of shops, the supply of these wants fell universally into the hands of itinerant dealers: the pedlar, who might appear once a month, being preferred to the fair, which only returned once or twice a year."&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J.S., ''Principles of a Political Economy'', London, Longman, 1909, Bk. I, Ch. II&lt;/ref&gt;

Blintiff has investigated the early Medieval networks of market towns across Europe, and suggests that by the 12th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional, different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns.&lt;ref&gt;Bintliff, J., "Going to Market in Antiquity", In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums'', Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Market-places appear to have emerged independently outside Europe. The [[Grand Bazaar, Istanbul|Grand Bazaar]] in [[Istanbul]] is often cited as the world's oldest continuously-operating market; its construction began in 1455. The Spanish conquistadors wrote glowingly of markets in the Americas. In the 15th century the [[Mexica]] ([[Aztec]]) market of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]] was the largest in all the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rebecca M. Seaman|title=Conflict in the Early Americas: An Encyclopedia of the Spanish Empire's ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXKjAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA375|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English market towns were regulated from a relatively early period. The English monarchs awarded a ''charter'' to local Lords to create markets and fairs for a town or village. This charter would grant the lords the right to take tolls and also afford some protection from rival markets. For example, once a chartered market was granted for specific market days, a nearby rival market could not open on the same days.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, C., ''Everyday Life in Medieval England'', London, Hambledon and London, 1994, pp. 283–303&lt;/ref&gt; Across the boroughs of England, a network of chartered markets sprang up between the 12th and 16th centuries, giving consumers reasonable choice in the markets they preferred to patronise.&lt;ref&gt;Borsay, P. and Proudfoot, L., ''Provincial Towns in Early Modern England and Ireland: Change, Convergence and Divergence, '' [The British Academy], Oxford University Press, 2002, pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; A study on the purchasing habits of the monks and other individuals in medieval England, suggests that consumers of the period were relatively discerning. Purchase decisions were based on purchase criteria such as consumers' perceptions of the range, quality, and price of goods. This informed decisions about where to make their purchases and which markets were superior.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, M. and Lee, J., "The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective", ''Business History Review'', Vol, 85, Spring 2011, {{doi|10.1017/S0007680511000018}}, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Today, traders and showmen jealously guard the reputation of these historic market charters.

Braudel and Reynold have made a systematic study of these European market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century. Their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were common in larger cities. Gradually over time, permanent shops with regular trading days began to supplant the periodic markets, while peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution. The physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and the economy was characterised by local trading. Braudel reports that, in 1600, goods travelled relatively short distances&amp;nbsp;– grain 5–10 miles; cattle 40–70 miles; wool and woollen cloth 20–40 miles. Following the European age of discovery, goods were imported from afar&amp;nbsp;– calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., ''The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century'', Berkely, CA, University of California Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

English essayist, [[Joseph Addison]], writing in 1711, described the exotic origin of produce available to English society in the following terms:

:"Our Ships are laden with the Harvest of every Climate: Our Tables are stored with Spices, and Oils, and Wines: Our Rooms are filled with Pyramids of China, and adorned with the Workmanship of Japan: Our Morning's Draught comes to us from the remotest Corners of the Earth: We repair our Bodies by the Drugs of America, and repose ourselves under Indian Canopies. My Friend Sir ANDREW calls the Vineyards of France our Gardens; the Spice-Islands our Hot-beds; the Persians our Silk-Weavers, and the Chinese our Potters. Nature indeed furnishes us with the bare Necessaries of Life, but Traffick gives us greater Variety of what is Useful, and at the same time supplies us with every thing that is Convenient and Ornamental."&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectator'', 19 May 1711, The Spectator Project, &lt;Online:http://www2.scc.rutgers.edu/spectator/text/may1711/no69.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Luca Clerici has made a detailed study of [[Vicenza]]’s food market during the sixteenth century. He found that there were many different types of reseller operating out of the markets. For example, in the dairy trade, cheese and butter was sold by the members of two craft guilds (i.e., cheesemongers who were shopkeepers) and that of the so-called ‘resellers’ (hucksters selling a wide range of foodstuffs), and by other sellers who were not enrolled in any guild. Cheesemongers’ shops were situated at the town hall and were very lucrative. Resellers and direct sellers increased the number of sellers, thus increasing competition, to the benefit of consumers. Direct sellers, who brought produce from the surrounding countryside, sold their wares through the central market place and priced their goods at considerably lower rates than cheesemongers.&lt;ref&gt;Clerici, L., "Le prix du bien commun. Taxation des prix et approvisionnement urbain (Vicence, XVIe-XVIIe siècle)" [The price of the common good. Official prices and urban provisioning in sixteenth and seventeenth century Vicenza] in I prezzi delle cose nell’età preindustriale /''The Prices of Things in Pre-Industrial Times'', [forthcoming], Firenze University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retailing in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries===
[[File:Ana Marie Wirth Apotheke.jpg|thumb|left|The retail service counter was an innovation of the eighteenth century]]

By the 17th century, permanent shops with more regular trading hours were beginning to supplant markets and fairs as the main retail outlet. Provincial shopkeepers were active in almost every English market town. These shopkeepers sold general merchandise, much like a contemporary convenience store or a general store. For example, William Allen, a mercer in Tamworth who died in 1604, sold spices alongside furs and fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England'', Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p,. 129&lt;/ref&gt; William Stout of Lancaster retailed sugar, tobacco, nails and prunes at both his shop and at the central markets. His autobiography reveals that he spent most of his time preparing products for sale at the central market, which brought an influx of customers into town.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England'', Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

As the number of shops grew, they underwent a transformation. The trappings of a modern shop, which had been entirely absent from the sixteenth and early seventeenth century store, gradually made way for store interiors and shopfronts that are more familiar to modern shoppers. Prior to the eighteenth century, the typical retail store had no counter, display cases, chairs, mirrors, changing-rooms, etc. However, the opportunity for the customer to browse merchandise, touch and feel products began to be available, with retail innovations from the late 17th and early 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England'', Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, pp. 153–54&lt;/ref&gt; Glazing was widely used from the early 18th-century. English commentators pointed to the speed at which glazing was installed, Daniel Defoe, writing in 1726, noted that "Never was there such painting and guildings, such sashings and looking-glasses as the shopkeepers as there is now."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Conlin, J., ''Tales of Two Cities: Paris, London and the Birth of the Modern City'', Atlantic Books, 2013, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wedgewood Ceramics at Birmingham Museum Collection (1).jpg|thumb|Josiah Wedgewood was one of the English entrepreneurs who held expansive displays in his private home or in rented premises]]

Outside the major metropolitan cities, few stores could afford to serve one type of clientele exclusively. However, gradually retail shops introduced innovations that would allow them to separate wealthier customers from the "riff raff." One technique was to have a window opening out onto the street from which customers could be served. This allowed the sale of goods to the common people, without encouraging them to come inside. Another solution, that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century was to invite favoured customers into a back-room of the store, where goods were permanently on display. Yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeeper's private home for the benefit of wealthier clients. Samuel Pepys, for example, writing in 1660, describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., ''Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England'', Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, pp. 155–59&lt;/ref&gt; The eighteenth century English entrepreneurs, [[Josiah Wedgewood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]], both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls.&lt;ref&gt;McKendrick, N., Brewer, J. and Plumb . J.H., ''The Birth of a Consumer Society: The Commercialization of Eighteenth Century England'', London, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Savitt has argued that by the eighteenth century, American merchants, who had been operating as importers and exporters, began to specialise in either wholesale or retail roles. They tended not to specialise in particular types of merchandise, often trading as general merchants, selling a diverse range of product types. These merchants were concentrated in the larger cities. They often provided high levels of credit financing for retail transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Savitt, R., "Looking Back to See Ahead: Writing the History of American Retailing", in ''Retailing: The Evolution and Development of Retailing'', A. M. Findlay, Leigh Sparks (eds), pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galeries de bois (ancien camp des Tartares), au Palais-Royal, 1825.jpg|thumb|left|Galeries de bois at au Palais-Royal, one of the earliest shopping arcades in Europe]]

By the late eighteenth century, grand shopping arcades began to emerge across Europe and in the Antipodes. A shopping arcade refers to a multiple-vendor space, operating under a covered roof. Typically, the roof was constructed of glass to allow for natural light and to reduce the need for candles or electric lighting. Some of the earliest examples of shopping arcade appeared in Paris, due its lack of pavement for pedestrians. Retailers, eager to attract window shoppers by providing a shopping environment away from the filthy streets, began to construct rudimentary arcades. Opening in 1771, the ''Coliseé'', situated on the Champs Elysee, consisted of three arcades, each with ten shops, all running off a central ballroom. For Parisians, the location was seen as too remote and the arcade closed within two years of opening.&lt;ref name="Conlin, J. 2013"/&gt; Inspired by the souks of Arabia, the Galerie de Bois, a series of wooden shops linked the ends of the Palais Royal, opened in 1786 and became a central part of Parisian social life.&lt;ref&gt;Conlin, J., ''Tales of Two Cities: Paris, London and the Birth of the Modern City'', Atlantic Books, 2013, Chapter 2; Willsher, K., "Paris's Galeries de Bois, Prototype of the Modern Shopping Centre", [A history of cities in 50 buildings, day 6], 30 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect, Bertrand Lemoine, described the period, 1786 to 1935, as ''l’Ère des passages couverts'' (the Arcade Era).&lt;ref&gt;Lemoine, B., ''Les Passages Couverts'', Paris: Délégation à l'action artistique de la ville de Paris [AAVP], 1990. {{ISBN|9782905118219}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the European capitals, shopping arcades spread across the continent, reaching their heyday in the early 19th century: the [[Palais Royal]] in Paris (opened in 1784); Passage de Feydeau in Paris (opened in 1791) and Passage du Claire in 1799.&lt;ref name="Conlin, J. 2013"/&gt; London's [[Piccadilly Arcade]] (opened in 1810); Paris's Passage Colbert (1826) and Milan's [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II|Galleria Vittorio Emanuele]] (1878).&lt;ref&gt;Sassatelli, R., ''Consumer Culture: History, Theory and Politics'', Sage, 2007, p. 27; Although the author specifically names Piccadilly Arcade, it is possible that she intended [[Burlington Arcade]] in Piccadilly.&lt;/ref&gt; Designed to attract the genteel middle class, arcade retailers sold luxury goods at relatively high prices. However, prices were never a deterrent, as these new arcades came to be the place to shop and to be seen. Arcades offered shoppers the promise of an enclosed space away from the chaos that characterised the noisy, dirty streets; a warm, dry space away from the elements, and a safe-haven where people could socialise and spend their leisure time. As thousands of glass covered arcades spread across Europe, they became grander and more ornately decorated. By the mid nineteenth century, they had become prominent centres of fashion and social life. Promenading in these arcades became a popular nineteenth century pass-time for the emerging middle classes. The ''Illustrated Guide to Paris'' of 1852 summarized the appeal of arcades in the following description:
[[File:Burlington Arcade by Thomas Hosmer Shepherd 1827-28.JPG|thumb|right|The Piccadilly entrance to the Burlington Arcade in 1827–28, shortly after its opening]]
: "In speaking of the inner boulevards, we have made mention again and again of the arcades which open onto them. These arcades, a recent invention of industrial luxury, are glass-roofed, marble-paneled corridors extending through whole blocks of buildings, whose owners have joined together for such enterprises. Lining both sides of these corridors, which get their light from above, are the most elegant shops, so that the arcade is a city, a world in miniature, in which customers will find everything they need."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Woodward, R. B., "Making a Pilgrimage to Cathedrals of Commerce", ''The New York Times'', 11 March 2007, &lt;Online: https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/travel/11culture.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palais-Royal, which opened to Parisians in 1784 and became one of the most important marketplaces in Paris, is generally regarded as the earliest example in the grand shopping arcades.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, I., ''Tradition and Innovation in English Retailing, 1700 to 1850'', Routledge, Oxon, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The Palais-Royal was a complex of gardens, shops and entertainment venues situated on the external perimeter of the grounds, under the original colonnades. The area boasted some 145 boutiques, cafés, salons, hair salons, bookshops, museums, and numerous refreshment kiosks as well as two theatres. The retail outlets specialised in luxury goods such as fine jewellery, furs, paintings and furniture designed to appeal to the wealthy elite. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex were among the first in Europe to abandon the system of bartering, and adopt fixed-prices thereby sparing their clientele the hassle of bartering. Stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, frequented by both the aristocracy and the middle classes. It developed a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation, revolving around the salons, cafés, and bookshops, but also became a place frequented by off-duty soldiers and was a favourite haunt of prostitutes, many of whom rented apartments in the building.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping'', ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 90–93&lt;/ref&gt; London's [[Burlington Arcade]], which opened in 1819, positioned itself as an elegant and exclusive venue from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping'', ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 92–95&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable nineteenth century grand arcades include the [[Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert]] in Brussels which was inaugurated in 1847, Istanbul's [[Çiçek Pasajı]] opened in 1870 and Milan's [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]] first opened in 1877. Shopping arcades were the precursor to the modern shopping mall.

[[File:ToadLane2009.jpg|thumb|left|The original Toad Lane Store, Rochdale, Manchester; one of Britain's earliest co-operative stores]]
While the arcades were the province of the bourgeoisie, a new type of retail venture emerged to serve the needs of the working poor. [[John Stuart Mill]] wrote about the rise of the [[consumers' co-operative|co-operative]] retail store, which he witnessed first-hand in the mid-nineteenth century. Stuart Mill locates these co-operative stores within a broader [[History of the cooperative movement|co-operative movement]] which was prominent in the industrial city of Manchester and in the counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire. He documents one of the early co-operative retail stores in [[Rochdale]] in Manchester, England, "In 1853, the Store purchased for £745, a warehouse (freehold) on the opposite side of the street, where they keep and retail their stores of flour, butcher's meat, potatoes, and kindred articles." Stuart Mill also quoted a contemporary commentator who wrote of the benefits of the co-operative store:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Buyer and seller meet as friends; there is no overreaching on one side, and no suspicion on the other... These crowds of humble working men, who never knew before when they put good food in their mouths, whose every dinner was adulterated, whose shoes let in the water a month too soon, whose waistcoats shone with devil's dust, and whose wives wore calico that would not wash, now buy in the markets like millionaires, and as far as pureness of food goes, live like lords.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J. S., ''Principles of a Political Economy with some of their Applications to Social Philosophy'', 7th ed., London, Longman, 1909, Section IV.7.53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Retailing in the modern era===
[[File:AA446b copy.jpeg|thumb|Department stores, such as [[Le Bon Marché]] of France, appeared from the mid nineteenth century]]

The modern era of retailing is defined as the period from the industrial revolution to the 21st-century.&lt;ref&gt;''Reshaping Retail: Why Technology is Transforming the Industry and How to Win in the New Consumer Dr''&lt;/ref&gt; In major cities, the [[department store]] emerged in the mid to late 19th-century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and redefined concepts of service and luxury. The term, "department store" originated in America. In 19th century England, these stores were known as emporia or warehouse shops.&lt;ref&gt;Koot, G.M.",Shops and Shopping in Britain: from market stalls to chain stores", University of Dartmouth, 2011, &lt;Online: https://www1.umassd.edu/ir/resources/consumption/shopping.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In London, the first department stores appeared in Oxford Street and Regent Street, where they formed part of a distinctly modern shopping precinct.&lt;ref&gt;Iarocci, L., ''Visual Merchandising: The Image of Selling'', Ashgate Publishing, 2013, pp 120-121&lt;/ref&gt; When London draper, [[William Whiteley]] attempted to transform his Bayswater drapery store into a department store by adding a meat and vegetable department and an Oriental Department in around 1875, he met with extreme resistance from other shop-keepers, who resented that he was encroaching on their territory and poaching their customers.&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport. E.D., "The Halls of Temptation: Gender, Politics, and the Construction of the Department Store in Late Victorian London", ''Journal of British Studies'', Vol. 35, No. 1, 1996, pp. 58-83 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/175745?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;  Before long, however, major department stores began to open across the US, Britain and Europe from the mid-nineteenth century including; Harrod's of London in 1834; Kendall's in Manchester in 1836; [[Selfridges]] of London in 1909; Macy's of New York in 1858; [[Bloomingdale's]] in 1861; [[Sak's Fifth Avenue|Sak's]] in 1867; [[J.C.

(eds), ''The Social History of the American Family: An Encyclopedia'', Volume 1, Sage, 2014, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the early department stores were more than just a retail emporium; rather they were venues where shoppers could spend their leisure time and be entertained. Some department stores offered reading rooms, art galleries and concerts. Most department stores had tea-rooms or dining rooms and offered treatment areas where ladies could indulge in a manicure. The fashion show, which originated in the US in around 1907, became a staple feature event for many department stores and celebrity appearances were also used to great effect. Themed events featured wares from foreign shores, exposing shoppers to the exotic cultures of the Orient and Middle-East.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Moss, M., ''Shopping as an Entertainment Experience'', Plymouth, Lexington Books, pp. 35–39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vaires Carrefour market.jpg|thumb|left|In 1963, [[Carrefour]] opened the first [[hypermarket]] in St Genevieve-de-Bois, near Paris,]]
During this period, retailers worked to develop modern retail marketing practices. Pioneering merchants who contributed to modern retail marketing and management methods include: [[A. T. Stewart]], [[Potter Palmer]], [[John Wanamaker]], [[Aaron Montgomery Ward|Montgomery Ward]], [[Marshall Field]], [[Richard Warren Sears]], [[Rowland Macy]], [[James Cash Penney|J.C. Penney]], [[Fred Lazarus, Jr.|Fred Lazarus]], brothers [[Edward Filene|Edward]] and William Filene and [[Sam Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, D., Kazeroony, H.H. and Ellis, G., ''The Routledge Companion to International Management Education'', London, Routledge, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Retail, using mail order, came of age during the mid-19th century. Although catalogue sales had been used since the 15th century, this method of retailing was confined to a few industries such as the sale of books and seeds. However, improvements in transport and postal services, led several entrepreneurs on either side of the Atlantic to experiment with catalogue sales. In 1861, Welsh draper [[Pryce Pryce-Jones]] sent catalogues to clients who could place orders for flannel clothing which was then despatched by post. This enabled Pryce-Jones to extend his client base across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein. J., ''101 Amazing Facts about Wales'', Andrews, UK, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, the US retailer, Montgomery Ward also devised a catalogue sales and mail-order system. His first catalogue which was issued in August 1872 consisted of an 8&amp;nbsp;in × 12&amp;nbsp;in (20&amp;nbsp;cm × 30&amp;nbsp;cm) single-sheet price list, listing 163 items for sale with ordering instructions for which Ward had written the copy. He also devised the catch-phrase "satisfaction guaranteed or your money back" which was implemented in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Hevrde, J., "Montgomery Ward's First Catalog", ''Chicago Tribune'', 31 January 2017, &lt;Online: Hevrdejshttp://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-firstcatalog-story-story.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1890s, [[Sears|Sears and Roebuck]] were also using mail order with great success.

Edward Filene, a proponent of the scientific approach to retail management, developed the concept of the ''automatic bargain Basement''. Although Filene's basement was not the first ‘bargain basement’ in the U.S., the principles of ‘automatic mark-downs’ generated excitement and proved very profitable. Under Filene's plan, merchandise had to be sold within 30 days or it was marked down; after a further 12 days, the merchandise was further reduced by 25% and if still unsold after another 18 days, a further markdown of 25% was applied. If the merchandise remained unsold after two months, it was given to charity.&lt;ref&gt;"Pioneers in Marketing: Edward A. Filene, Lincoln Filene and Daniel Bloomfield", ''Journal of Marketing'', Vol. 23, No. 3, 1959, pp. 296–300&lt;/ref&gt; Filene was a pioneer in employee relations. He instituted a profit sharing program, a minimum wage for women, a 40-hour work week, health clinics and paid vacations. He also played an important role in encouraging the Filene Cooperative Association, "perhaps the earliest American company union". Through this channel he engaged constructively with his employees in collective bargaining and arbitration processes.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, Y., "Edward Filene: Pioneer of Social Responsibility", ''Jewish Currents'', September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Warsaw ochota Blue City01.JPG|thumb|Shopping mall in Warsaw, Poland]]

In the post-war period, an American architect, [[Victor Gruen]] developed a concept for a shopping mall; a planned, self-contained shopping complex complete with an indoor plaza, statues, planting schemes, piped music, and car-parking. Gruen's vision was to create a shopping atmosphere where people felt so comfortable, they would spend more time in the environment, thereby enhancing opportunities for purchasing. The first of these malls opened at [[Northland Center (Michigan)|Northland Mall]] near Detroit in 1954. He went on to design some 50 such malls. Due to the success of the mall concept, Gruen was described as "the most influential architect of the twentieth century by a journalist in the New Yorker."&lt;ref name=NYer04&gt;Malcolm Gladwell, [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/03/15/040315fa_fact1 The Terrazzo Jungle], ''The New Yorker'', March 15, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the twentieth century, a trend towards larger store footprints became discernible. The average size of a U.S. supermarket grew from {{Convert|31000|sqft|m2}} square feet in 1991 to {{Convert|44000|sqft|m2}} square feet in 2000. In 1963, Carrefour opened the first [[hypermarket]] in St Genevieve-de-Bois, near Paris, France.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping'', ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the twentieth century, stores were using labels such as "mega-stores" and "warehouse" stores to reflect their growing size. In Australia, for example, the popular hardware chain, Bunnings has shifted from smaller "home centres" (retail floor space under {{Convert|5000|m2|sqft}}) to "warehouse" stores (retail floor space between {{Convert|5000|m2|sqft}} and {{Convert|21000|m2|sqft}}) in order to accommodate a wider range of goods and in response to population growth and changing consumer preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, S., “Bunnings Shifts Focus as it Upsizes Store Network", ''The Age'', 3 June 2015 &lt;Online:  http://www.theage.com.au/business/bunnings-shifts-focus-as-it-upsizes-store-network-2&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The upward trend of increasing retail space was not consistent across nations, and led in the early 21st century to a 2-fold difference in square footage per capita between the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Death of Retail is Greatly Exaggerated|last=Wahba|first=Phil|date=15 June 2017|work=Fortune|access-date=|page=34|type=Print magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 21st century takes shape, some indications suggest that large retail stores have come under increasing pressure from online sales models and that reductions in store size are evident.&lt;ref&gt;Wetherell, S., "The Shopping Mall’s Socialist Pre-History", Jacobin Magazine, 4 August 2014 &lt;Online: https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/04/the-last-shopping-mall&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Under such competition and other issues such as business debt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Townsend|first1=Matt|last2=Surane|first2=Jenny|last3=Orr|first3=Emma|last4=Cannon|first4=Christopher|title=America’s ‘Retail Apocalypse’ Is Really Just Beginning|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-retail-debt/|accessdate=15 January 2018|publisher=Bloomberg|date=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been a noted business disruption called the [[retail apocalypse]] in recent years which several retail businesses, especially in North America, are sharply reducing their number of stores, or going out of business entirely.

==Retail strategy==
{{See also|Strategic planning}}

[[File:Supermarket check out.JPG|thumb|left|Retailers make many strategic decisions&amp;nbsp;– store type, market served, product assortment and customer services]]

The distinction between "strategic" and "managerial" decision-making is commonly used to distinguish "two phases having different goals and based on different conceptual tools. Strategic planning concerns the choice of policies aiming at improving the competitive position of the firm, taking account of challenges and opportunities proposed by the competitive environment. On the other hand, managerial decision-making is focused on the implementation of specific targets."&lt;ref&gt;Volpato, G. and Stocchetti, A., "Old and new approaches to marketing: The quest of their epistemological roots", MPRA Paper No. 30841, 2009, &lt;Online: https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/30841&gt;, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

In retailing, the strategic plan is designed to set out the [[Vision statement|vision]] and provide guidance for retail decision-makers and provide an outline of how the product and service mix will optimize customer satisfaction. As part of the strategic planning process, it is customary for strategic planners to carry out a detailed environmental scan which seeks to identify trends and opportunities in the competitive environment, market environment, economic environment and statutory-political environment. The retail strategy is normally devised or reviewed every 3– 5 years by the chief executive officer.

The strategic retail analysis typically includes following elements:&lt;ref&gt;Lambda, A.J., ''The Art Of Retailing'', McGraw-Hill, (2003), 2008, pp. 315–26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lanvin Monte Carlo 2004.jpg|thumb|The retailer also considers the overall strategic position and retail image]]
; * Market analysis
::Market size, stage of market, market competitiveness, market attractiveness, market trends
; * Customer analysis
::[[Market segmentation]], demographic, geographic and psychographic profile, values and attitudes, shopping habits, brand preferences, analysis of needs and wants, media habits
; * Internal analysis
:: Other capabilities e.g. human resource capability, technological capability, financial capability, ability to generate [[economies of scale|scale economies]] or [[economies of scope]], trade relations, reputation, positioning, past performance

; * Evaluation of the economics of the strategy

At the conclusion of the retail analysis, the retail marketers should have a clear idea of which groups of customers are to be the target of marketing activities. Retail research studies suggest that there is a strong relationship between a store's positioning and the socio-economic status of customers.&lt;ref&gt;Fill,  C., ''Marketing Communications: Framework, Theories and Application'', London, Prentice Hall, 1995, p. 70; {{Cite news|url=https://www.jsbmarketresearch.com/retail|title=Retail Market Research Reports {{!}} Retail Market Reports|last=Ltd.|first=JSB Market Research Pvt|work=JSB Market Research|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the retail strategy, including service quality, has a significant and positive association with customer loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Yu-Jia, H. (2012). The Moderating Effect of Brand Equity and the Mediating Effect of Marketing Mix Strategy On the Relationship Between Service Quality and Customer Loyalty. International Journal of Organizational Innovation, 155-162.&lt;/ref&gt; A marketing strategy effectively outlines all key aspects of firms' targeted audience, demographics, preferences. In a highly competitive market, the retail strategy sets up long-term sustainability. It focuses on customer relationships, stressing the importance of added value, customer satisfaction and highlights how the store's market positioning appeals to targeted groups of customers.&lt;ref&gt;Morschett, D., Swoboda, B. and Schramm, H., "Competitive Strategies in Retailing: An Investigation of the Applicability of Porter’s Framework for Food Retailers ''Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services'', Vol. 13, 2006, pp 275–287&lt;/ref&gt;

==The retail marketing mix==
[[File:Retail mix.jpg|thumb|The retail marketing mix or the 6 Ps of retailing]]

See also [[product management]]; [[promotion mix]]; [[marketing mix]]; [[price]]; [[servicescape]]s and [[retail design]]

Once the strategic plan is in place, retail managers turn to the more managerial aspects of planning. A retail mix is devised for the purpose of coordinating day-to-day tactical decisions. The retail marketing mix typically consists of six broad decision layers including product decisions, place decisions, promotion, price, personnel and presentation (also known as physical evidence).&lt;ref&gt;Monash University, Dictionary, https://business.monash.edu/marketing/marketing-dictionary/r/retail-mix&lt;/ref&gt; The retail mix is loosely based on the [[marketing mix]], but has been expanded and modified in line with the unique needs of the retail context. A number of scholars have argued for an expanded marketing, mix with the inclusion of two new Ps, namely, ''Personnel'' and ''Presentation'' since these contribute to the customer's unique retail experience and are the principal basis for retail differentiation. Yet other scholars argue that the ''Retail Format'' (i.e. retail formula) should be included.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinides, E., "The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing", ''Journal of Marketing Management'', Vo. 22, 2006, pp 422-423&lt;/ref&gt; The modified retail marketing mix that is most commonly cited in text-books is often called the ''6 Ps of retailing'' (see diagram at right).&lt;ref&gt;Berens, J.S., "The Marketing Mix, the Retailing Mix and the Use of Retail Strategy Continua", ''Proceedings of the 1983 Academy of Marketing Science (AMS)'', [Part of the series Developments in Marketing Science], pp. 323–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, C.W., Hair, J.F. and McDaniel, C., ''MKTG 2010'', Mason, OH, Cengage, pp. 193–94&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product===
See [[Product management]]

The primary product-related decisions facing the retailer are the product assortment (what product lines, how many lines and which brands to carry); the type of customer service (high contact through to self-service) and the availability of support services (e.g. credit terms, delivery services, after sales care). These decisions depend on careful analysis of the market, demand, competition as well as the retailer's skills and expertise.

====Product assortment====
[[File:Supermarket full of goods.jpg|thumb|left|A typical supermarket carries an assortment of between 30,000 and 60,000 different products]]

The term product assortment refers to the combination of both product breadth and depth. The main characteristics of a company's product assortment are:&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/product-assortment.html&lt;/ref&gt;

;(1) the length or number of products lines
: the number of different products carried by a store
;(2) the breadth
: refers to the variety of product lines that a store offers. It is also known as product assortment width, merchandise breadth, and product line width.:
;(3) depth or number of product varieties within a product line
: the number of each item or particular styles carried by a store
;(4) consistency
: how products relate to each other in a retail environment.
For a retailer, finding the right balance between breadth and depth can be a key to success. An average supermarket might carry 30,000–60,000 different product lines (product length or assortment), but might carry up to 100 different types of toothpaste (product depth).&lt;ref&gt;Broniarczyk, S.M., "Product Assortment", in ''Handbook of Consumer Psychology'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Speciality retailers typically carry fewer product lines, perhaps as few as 20 lines, but will normally stock greater depth. Costco, for example, carries 5,000 different lines while [[Aldi]] carries just 1,400 lines per store.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Berman, "5 Ways Retailers Can Make More Profit By Reducing Product Assortment &amp; Managing Websales Like Costco Does", 20 November 2012, http://upstreamcommerce.com/blog/2012/11/20/5-ways-retailers-profit-reducing-product-assortment-managing-websales-costco&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aldi Zurmaiener Straße.jpg|thumb|Discount grocery retailer, [[Aldi]], has successfully trimmed the number of product lines it carries to about 1,400]]

Large assortments offer consumers many benefits, notably increased choice and the possibility that the consumer will be able to locate the ideal product. However, for the retailer, larger assortments incur costs in terms of record-keeping, managing inventory, pricing and risks associated with wastage due to spoiled, shopworn or unsold stock. Carrying more stock also exposes the retailer to higher risks in terms of slow-moving stock and lower sales per square foot of store space. On the other hand, reducing the number of product lines can generate cost savings through increased stock turnover by eliminating slow-moving lines, fewer stockouts, increased bargaining power with suppliers, reduced costs associated with wastage and carrying inventory, and higher sales per square foot which means more efficient space utilisation.

When determining the number of product lines to carry, the retailer must consider the store type, store's physical storage capacity, the perishability of items, expected turnover rates for each line and the customer's needs and expectations.

====Customer service and supporting services====
[[File:20111012-FNCS-LSC-0488 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|left|Self-service is a more cost efficient way to deliver goods]]

[[Customer service]] is the "sum of acts and elements that allow consumers to receive what they need or desire from [the] retail establishment." Retailers must decide whether to provide a full service outlet or minimal service outlet, such as no-service in the case of vending machines; self-service with only basic sales assistance or a full service operation as in many boutiques and speciality stores. In addition, the retailer needs to make decisions about sales support such as customer delivery and after sales customer care.

Retailing services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, exchange/ return services, product demonstration, special orders, customer loyalty programs, limited-scale trial, advisory services and a range of other supporting services. Retail stores often seek to differentiate along customer service lines. For example, some department stores offer the services of a ''stylist''; a fashion advisor, to assist customers selecting a fashionable wardrobe for the forthcoming season, while smaller boutiques may allow regular customers to take goods home ''on approval'', enabling the customer to try out goods before making the final purchase. The variety of supporting services offered is known as the ''service type.'' At one end of the spectrum, self-service operators offer few basic support services. At the other end of the spectrum, full-service operators offer a broad range of highly personalised customer services to augment the retail experience.&lt;ref&gt;Lambda, A.J., ''The Art Of Retailing'', McGraw-Hill, New Dehli, 2008, pp. 351–411&lt;/ref&gt;

When making decisions about customer service, the retailer must balance the customer's desire for full-service against the customer's willingness to pay for the cost of delivering supporting services. Self-service is a very cost efficient way of delivering services since the retailer harnesses the customers labour power to carry out many of the retail tasks. However, many customers appreciate full service and are willing to pay a premium for the benefits of full-service.&lt;ref&gt;Lambda, A.J., ''The Art Of Retailing'', McGraw-Hill, (2003), 2008, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

A sales assistant's role typically includes greeting customers, providing product and service-related information, providing advice about products available from current stock, answering customer questions, finalising customer transactions and if necessary, providing follow-up service necessary to ensure customer satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Philip H. Mitchell 2008, ''Discovery-Based Retail'', Bascom Hill Publishing Group {{ISBN|978-0-9798467-9-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For retail store owners, it is extremely important to train personnel with the requisite skills necessary to deliver excellent customer service. Such skills may include product knowledge, inventory management, handling cash and credit transactions, handling product exchange and returns, dealing with difficult customers and of course, a detailed knowledge of store policies. The provision of excellent customer service creates more opportunities to build enduring customer relationships with the potential to turn customers into sources of referral or retail advocates. In the long term, excellent customer service provides businesses with an ongoing [[reputation]] and may lead to a competitive advantage. Customer service is essential for several reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Customer Service: Why it is important {{!}} business.gov.au|url = http://www.business.gov.au/business-topics/selling-products-and-services/customers/Pages/customer-service.aspx|website = www.business.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, customer service contributes to the customer's overall retail experience. Secondly, evidence suggests that a retail organization which trains its employees in appropriate customer service benefits more than those who do not. [[Customer service training]] entails instructing personnel in the methods of servicing the customer that will benefit corporations and businesses. It is important to establish a bond amongst customers-employees known as [[Customer relationship management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.gov.au/business-topics/selling-products-and-services/customers/Pages/customer-service.aspx|title=What is good customer service?|first=c=AU;o=Australian Government;ou=Department of Industry, Innovation and|last=Science|date=15 November 2017|website=www.business.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saluhallen i Helsingfors (2).jpg|thumb|Counter service is associated with full service retail outlets and allows the salesperson to provide expert advice]]

=====Types of customer service=====
There are several ways the retailer can deliver services to consumers:
* [[Counter service]], where goods are out of reach of buyers and must be obtained from the seller. This type of retail is common for small expensive items (e.g. jewellery) and controlled items like medicine and liquor.
* Click and Commute, where products are ordered online and are picked up via a drive through.
* Ship to Store, where products are ordered online and can be picked up at the retailer's main store
* [[Delivery (commerce)|Delivery]], where goods are shipped directly to consumer's homes or workplaces.
* [[Mail order]] from a printed catalogue was invented in 1744 and was common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Ordering by [[telephone]] was common in the 20th century, either from a catalog, newspaper, [[television advertisement]] or a local restaurant [[menu]], for immediate service (especially for [[pizza delivery]]), remaining in common use for food orders. Internet shopping&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;– a form of delivery&amp;nbsp;– has eclipsed phone-ordering, and, in several sectors&amp;nbsp;– such as books and music&amp;nbsp;– all other forms of buying. There is increasing competitor pressure to deliver consumer goods&amp;nbsp;– especially those offered online&amp;nbsp;– in a more timely fashion. Large online retailers such as [[Amazon.com]] are continually innovating and as of 2015 offer one-hour delivery in certain areas. They are also working with drone technology to provide consumers with more efficient delivery options. [[Direct marketing]], including [[telemarketing]] and television [[shopping channel]]s, are also used to generate telephone orders. started gaining significant market share in developed countries in the 2000s.
* [[Door-to-door]] sales, where the salesperson sometimes travels with the goods for sale.
* [[Self service|Self-service]], where goods may be handled and examined prior to purchase.
* [[Digital distribution|Digital delivery]] or [[Download]], where intangible goods, such as music, film, and electronic books and subscriptions to magazines, are delivered directly to the consumer in the form of information transmitted either over wires or air-waves, and is reconstituted by a device which the consumer controls (such as an [[MP3 player]]; see ''[[digital rights management]]''). The digital sale of models for [[3D printing]] also fits here, as do the media leasing types of services, such as [[streaming media|streaming]].

=== Place ===
Place decisions are primarily concerned with consumer access and may involve location, space utilisation and operating hours.

[[File:Souvenir.london.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|Sellers of souvenirs are typically located in high traffic areas such as this London souvenir stand situated near a railway station on a busy street corner]]

====Location====
Also see [[Site selection]]

Retail stores are typically located where market opportunities are optimal&amp;nbsp;– high traffic areas, central business districts. Selecting the right site can be a major success factor. When evaluating potential sites, retailers often carry out a ''trade area analysis''; a detailed analysis designed to approximate the potential patronage area. Techniques used in trade area analysis include: [[Radial set|Radial (ring) studies]]; [[Gravity model of trade|Gravity models]] and Drive time analyses.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, D., "Retail Trade Area Analysis: Concepts and New Approaches", ''Directions Magazine'', n.d. &lt;Online: http://www.directionsmag.com/entry/retail-trade-area-analysis-concepts-and-new-approaches/129766&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, retailers may consider a range of both qualitative and quantitative factors to evaluate to potential sites under consideration:

===== Macro factors =====
:: Macro factors include market characteristics (demographic, economic and socio-cultural), demand, competition and infrastructure (e.g. the availability of power, roads, public transport systems)

===== Micro factors =====
:: Micro factors include the size of the site (e.g. availability of parking), access for delivery vehicles

====Channels====

A major retail trend has been the shift to multi-channel retailing. To counter the disruption caused by online retail, many bricks and mortar retailers have entered the online retail space, by setting up online catalogue sales and e-commerce websites. However, many retailers have noticed that consumers behave differently when shopping online. For instance, in terms of choice of online platform, shoppers tend to choose the online site of their preferred retailer initially, but as they gain more experience in online shopping, they become less loyal and more likely to switch to other retail sites.&lt;ref&gt;Verhoef, P., Kannan, P.K. and Inman, J., "From Multi-channel Retailing to Omni-channel Retailing: Introduction to the Special Issue on Multi-channel Retailing", ''Journal of Retailing'', vol. 91,  mpp 174-181. DOI: 10.1016/j.jretai.2015.02.005&lt;/ref&gt; Online stores are usually available 24 hours a day, and many consumers in Western countries have Internet access both at work and at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-02-06|title=Online shopping|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Online_shopping&amp;oldid=824282185|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pricing strategy and tactics===
See also [[Pricing Strategies]]

[[File:Sale Tags.jpg|thumb|A price tag is a highly visual and objective guide to value]]

The broad pricing strategy is normally established in the company's overall strategic plan. In the case of chain stores, the pricing strategy would be set by head office. Broadly, there are six approaches to pricing strategy mentioned in the marketing literature:

: '''Operations-oriented pricing''': where the objective is to optimise productive capacity, to achieve operational efficiencies or to match supply and demand through varying prices. In some cases, prices might be set to [[demarketing|demarket]].&lt;ref name="Dibb, S. 2013"&gt;Dibb, S., Simkin, L., Pride, W.C. and Ferrell, O.C., ''Marketing: Concepts and Strategies'', Cengage, 2013, Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''Revenue-oriented pricing:''' (also known as ''profit-oriented pricing'' or ''cost-based pricing'')&amp;nbsp;– where the marketer seeks to maximise the profits (i.e., the surplus income over costs) or simply to cover costs and [[Break-even (economics)|break even]].&lt;ref name="Dibb, S. 2013"/&gt;

: '''Customer-oriented pricing''': where the objective is to maximise the number of customers; encourage cross-selling opportunities or to recognise different levels in the customer's ability to pay.&lt;ref name="Dibb, S. 2013"/&gt;

: '''[[Value-based pricing]]''': (also known as ''image-based pricing'') occurs where the company uses prices to signal market value or associates price with the desired value position in the mind of the buyer. The aim of value-based pricing is to reinforce the overall positioning strategy e.g. premium pricing posture to pursue or maintain a luxury image.&lt;ref&gt;Nagle, T., Hogan, J. and Zale, J., ''The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Growing More Profitably'', Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 1 and 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, R., Canning, L. and McDowell, R., ''Business-to-Business Marketing'', 2nd ed., London, Sage, 2011, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

: [[Relationship-based pricing|'''Relationship-oriented pricing''']]: where the marketer sets prices in order to build or maintain relationships with existing or potential customers.&lt;ref&gt;Neumeier, M.,
''The Brand Flip: Why customers now run companies and how to profit from it (Voices That Matter)'', 2008, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

:  '''Socially-oriented pricing''': Where the objective is to encourage or discourage specific social attitudes and behaviours. e.g. high tariffs on tobacco to discourage smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin, G., ''Modern Cost-Benefit Methods'', Macmillan, 1978, pp. 137–60&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pricing tactics====
{{see also|Pricing}}
[[File:Bonownik kelnerski czytnik kodów kreskowych drukarka fiskalna HORECA13.jpg|thumb|left|Retailers must also plan for mode of payment]]

When decision-makers have determined the broad approach to pricing (i.e., the pricing strategy), they turn their attention to pricing tactics. Tactical pricing decisions are shorter term prices, designed to accomplish specific short-term goals. The tactical approach to pricing may vary from time to time, depending on a range of internal considerations (e.g. the need to clear surplus inventory) or external factors (e.g. a response to competitive pricing tactics). Accordingly, a number of different pricing tactics may be employed in the course of a single planning period or across a single year. Typically store managers have the necessary latitude to vary prices on individual lines provided that they operate within the parameters of the overall strategic approach.

Retailers must also plan for customer preferred payment modes&amp;nbsp;– e.g. cash, credit, lay-by, Electronic Funds Transfer at Point-of-Sale (EFTPOS). All payment options require some type of handling and attract costs. If credit is to be offered, then credit terms will need to be determined. If lay-by is offered, then the retailer will need to take into account the storage and handling requirements. If cash is the dominant mode of payment, the retailer will need to consider small change requirements, the number of cash floats required, wages costs associated with handling large volumes of cash and the provision of secure storage for change floats. Large retailers, handling significant volumes of cash, may need to hire security service firms to carry the day's takings and deliver supplies of small change. A small, but increasing number of retailers are beginning to accept newer modes of payment including PayPal and Bitcoin.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, A., "PayPal Deepens Retail Drive in Discover Payments Deal", ''Technology News.'' 22 August 2012, &lt;Online: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Retail&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16#&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Subway (US) recently announced that it would accept Bitcoin payments.&lt;ref&gt;CNBC, "Somebody tell Jared: This Subway Takes Bitcoins", 18 November 2013, https://www.cnbc.com/2013/11/18/somebody-tell-jared-this-subway-takes-bitcoins.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sales promotion 2015 0003.JPG|thumb|A discount is any form of reduction in price]]
Pricing tactics that are commonly used in retail include:

;Discount pricing
Discount pricing is where the marketer or retailer offers a reduced price. Discounts in a variety of forms&amp;nbsp;– e.g. quantity discounts, loyalty rebates, seasonal discounts, periodic or random discounts etc.&lt;ref name="Rao, V.R 2009, p.15"&gt;Rao, V.R. and Kartono, B., "Pricing Strategies and Objectives: A Cross-cultural Survey", in ''Handbook of Pricing Research in Marketing'', Rao, V.R. (ed), Northampton, MA, Edward Elgar, 2009, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EDLP 2.JPG|thumb|left|Everyday Low Prices" are widely used in supermarkets]]
;Everyday low prices (EDLP)
[[Everyday low price]]s refers to the practice of maintaining a regular low price-low price&amp;nbsp;– in which consumers are not forced to wait for discounting or specials. This method is extensively used by supermarkets.&lt;ref&gt;Hoch, S.J., Dreze, X. and Purk, M., "EDLP, Hi-Lo, and Margin Arithmetic", ''The Journal of Marketing'', Volume 58, Number 4, 1994, pp. 16–27&lt;/ref&gt;

;High-low pricing
High-low pricing refers to the practice of offering goods at a high price for a period of time, followed by offering the same goods at a low price for a predetermined time. This practice is widely used by chain stores selling homewares. The main disadvantage of the high-low tactic is that consumers tend to become aware of the price cycles and time their purchases to coincide with a low-price cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Hoch, S.J., Dreze, X. and Purk, M. E., "EDLP, Hi-Lo, and Margin Arithmetic", ''The Journal of Marketing'', Volume 58, Number 4, 1994, pp. 16–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, P., "Deception in retailer high-low pricing: A 'rule of reason' approach", ''Journal of Retailing, '' Volume 70, Issue 2, 1994, pp. 115–1383.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Loss leader
A [[loss leader]] is a product that has a price set below the [[operating margin]]. Loss leadering is widely used in supermarkets and budget-priced retail outlets where it is intended to generate store traffic. The low price is widely promoted and the store is prepared to take a small loss on an individual item, with an expectation that it will recoup that loss when customers purchase other higher priced-higher margin items. In service industries, loss leadering may refer to the practice of charging a reduced price on the first order as an inducement and with anticipation of charging higher prices on subsequent orders.

;Price bundling
[[File:Xbox 360 FF XIII Special Ed. bundle price tag at Target, Tanforan.JPG|thumb|Xbox price bundle price]]
Price bundling (also known as [[product bundling]]) occurs where two or more products or services are priced as a package with a single price. There are several types of bundles: ''pure bundles'' where the goods can only be purchased as package or ''mixed bundles'' where the goods can be purchased individually or as a package. The prices of the bundle is typically less than when the two items are purchased separately.&lt;ref&gt;Guiltnan, J.P., "The Price Bundling of Services", ''Journal of Marketing'', April 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Price bundling is extensively used in the personal care sector to prices cosmetics and skincare.

;Price lining
''Price lining'' is the use of a limited number of prices for all product offered by a business. Price lining is a tradition started in the old [[five and dime]] stores in which everything cost either 5 or 10 cents. In price lining, the price remains constant but quality or extent of product or service adjusted to reflect changes in cost. The underlying rationale of this tactic is that these amounts are seen as suitable [[price points]] for a whole range of products by prospective customers. It has the advantage of ease of administering, but the disadvantage of inflexibility, particularly in times of [[inflation]] or unstable prices. Price lining continues to be widely used in department stores where customers often note racks of garments or accessories priced at predetermined price points e.g. separate racks of men's ties, where each rack is priced at $10, $20 and $40.

;Promotional pricing
Promotional pricing is a temporary measure that involves setting prices at levels lower than normally charged for a good or service. Promotional pricing is sometimes a reaction to unforeseen circumstances, as when a downturn in demand leaves a company with excess stocks; or when competitive activity is making inroads into market share or profits.&lt;ref&gt;Livesay, F., ''Promotional Pricing'', Macmillan, 1976, pp. 77–82&lt;/ref&gt;

;Psychological pricing
[[File:Fan-Tankstelle von Dynamo Dresden.JPG|thumb|left|Extensive use of the terminal digit 'nine' suggests that psychological pricing is at play]]

[[Psychological pricing]] is a range of tactics designed to have a positive psychological impact. Price tags using the terminal digit "9", ($9.99, $19.99 or $199.99) can be used to signal [[price point]]s and bring an item in at just under the consumer's [[reservation price]]. Psychological pricing is widely used in a variety of retail settings.&lt;ref&gt;Poundstone, W., ''Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value (and How to Take Advantage of It)'', New York: Hill and Wang, 2011, pp. 184–200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personnel and staffing===
Because patronage at a retail outlet varies, flexibility in [[Schedule (workplace)|scheduling]] is desirable. [[Employee scheduling software]] is sold, which, using known patterns of customer patronage, more or less reliably predicts the need for staffing for various functions at times of the year, day of the month or week, and time of day. Usually needs vary widely. Conforming staff utilization to staffing needs requires a flexible workforce which is available when needed but does not have to be paid when they are not, [[part-time]] [[Workforce|workers]]; as of 2012 70% of retail workers in the United States were part-time. This may result in financial problems for the workers, who while they are required to be available at all times if their work hours are to be maximized, may not have sufficient income to meet their family and other obligations.&lt;ref name=NYT102812&gt;{{cite news|title=A Part-Time Life, as Hours Shrink and Shift|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/business/a-part-time-life-as-hours-shrink-and-shift-for-american-workers.html|accessdate=28 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 October 2012|author=Steven Greenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Selling and sales techniques====
Also see [[Personal selling]]

[[File:(1)Burwood McDonalds.jpg|thumb|One of the most well-known cross-selling sales scripts comes from McDonald's. "Would you like fries with that?"]]
Retailers can employ different techniques to enhance sales volume and to improve the customer experience:

; Add-on, Upsell or Cross-sell.
: Upselling and cross selling are sometimes known as ''suggestive selling.'' When the consumer has selected their main purchase, sales assistants can try to sell the customer on a premium brand or higher quality item (up-selling) or can suggest complementary purchases (cross-selling). For instance, if a customer purchases a non-stick frypan, the sales assistant might suggest plastic slicers that do not damage the non-stick surface.
; Selling on value
: Skilled sales assistants find ways to focus on value rather than price. Selling on value often involves identifying a product’s unique features. Adding value to goods or services such as a free gift or buy 1 get 1 free adds value to customers where as the store is gaining sales&lt;ref&gt;Hee, J. K., "Stand-alone Sale of a Free Gift: Is it effective to accentuate promotion value?" ''Social Behavior &amp; Personality: An International Journal'', Vol. 43, no. 10, 2015, pp 1593-1606&lt;/ref&gt;
; Know when to close the sale
: Sales staff must learn to recognise when the customer is ready to make a purchase. If the sales person feels that the customer is ready, then they may seek to gain commitment and close the sale. Experienced sales staff soon learn to recognise specific verbal and non-verbal cues that signal the client's readiness to buy. For instance, if a customer begins to handle the merchandise, this may indicate a state of buyer interest. Clients also tend to employ different types of questions throughout the sales process. General questions such as, "Does it come in any other colours (or styles)?" indicate only a moderate level of interest. However, when clients begin to ask specific questions, such as "Do you have this model in black?" then this often indicates that the prospect is approaching readiness to buy.&lt;ref&gt;Cant, M.C. and van Heerden, C.H., ''Personal Selling'', Juta Academic, 2008, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; When the sales person believes that the prospective buyer is ready to make the purchase, a ''trial close'' might be used to test the waters. A trial close is simply any attempt to confirm the buyer's interest in finalising the sale. An example of a trial close, is "Would you be requiring our team to install the unit for you?" or "Would you be available to take delivery next Thursday?" If the sales person is unsure about the prospect's readiness to buy, they might consider using a 'trial close.' The salesperson can use several different techniques to close the sale; including the ‘alternative close’, the ‘assumptive close’, the ‘summary close’, or the ‘special-offer close’, among others.

===Promotion===
One of the unique aspects of retail promotions is that two brands are often involved; the store brand and the brands that make up the retailer's product range. Retail promotions that focus on the store tend to be ‘image’ oriented, raising awareness of the store and creating a positive attitude towards the store and its services. Retail promotions that focus on the product range, are designed to cultivate a positive attitude to the brands stocked by the store, in order to indirectly encourage favourable attitudes towards the store itself.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L., ''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications'', Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Some retail advertising and promotion is partially or wholly funded by brands and this is known as co-operative (or co-op) advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L., ''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications'', Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Retailers make extensive use of advertising via newspapers, television and radio to encourage store preference. In order to up-sell or cross-sell, retailers also use a variety of in-store sales promotional techniques such as product demonstrations, samples, point-of-purchase displays, free trial, events, promotional packaging and promotional pricing. In grocery retail, shelf wobblers, trolley advertisements, taste tests and recipe cards are also used. Many retailers also use loyalty programs to encourage repeat patronage.

===Presentation===
See [[Merchandising]]; [[Servicescape]]s; [[Retail design]]
[[File:Truefitt &amp; Hill products.jpg|thumb|The way that products are displayed is part of the store's presentation]]

Presentation refers to the physical evidence that signals the retail image. Physical evidence may include a diverse range of elements&amp;nbsp;– the store itself including premises, offices, exterior facade and interior layout, websites, delivery vans, warehouses, staff uniforms.

==== Designing retail spaces ====
[[File:Servicescapes.pdf|thumb|left|Simplified servicescapes model]]

The environment in which the retail service encounter occurs is sometimes known as the ''retail servicescape.''&lt;ref&gt;"The Impact of Retail Servicescape on Buying Behaviour", ''BVIMSR's Journal of Management Research'',  Vol 6, No. 2, 2014, pp. 10–17&lt;/ref&gt; The store environment consists of many elements such as smells, the physical environment (furnishings, layout and functionality), ambient conditions (lighting, temperature, noise) as well as signs, symbols and artifacts (e.g. sales promotions, shelf space, sample stations, visual communications). Collectively, these elements contribute to the ''perceived retail servicescape'' or the overall ''atmosphere'' and can influence both the customer's cognitions, emotions and their behaviour within the retail space.

Retail designers pay close attention to the front of the store, which is known as the ''decompression zone''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, B., &amp; Francis, D. (2002). Store design that sells. Hardware Merchandising, 42–46.&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually an open space in the entrance of the store to allow customers to adjust to their new environment. An open-plan floor design is effective in retail as it allows customers to see everything. In terms of the store's exterior, the side of the road cars normally travel, determines the way stores direct customers. New Zealand retail stores, for instance, would direct customers to the left.

In order to maximise the number of selling opportunities, retailers generally want customers to spend more time in a retail store. However, this must be balanced against customer expectations surrounding convenience, access and realistic waiting times. The overall aim of designing a retail environment is to have customers enter the store, and explore the totality of the physical environment engaging in a variety of retail experiences&amp;nbsp;– from browsing through to sampling and ultimately to purchasing. The retail service environment plays an important role in affecting the customer's perceptions of the retail experience.&lt;ref&gt;Wakefield, L. K. and Blodgett, G. J., "The Effect of the Servicescape on Customers’ Behavioral Intentions in Leisure Service Settings", ''The Journal of Services Marketing'', Vol. 10, No. 6, pp. 45–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harrods Food Department Halls (8473364801).jpg|thumb|The retail servicescape includes the appearance, equipment, display space, retail counters, signage, layout and functionality of a retail outlet. Pictured:[[Harrods]] food court]]

The retail environment not only affects quality perceptions, but can also impact on the way that customers navigate their way through the retail space during the retail service encounter. Layout, directional signage, the placement of furniture, shelves and display space along with the store's ambient conditions all affect patron's passage through the retail service system. Layout refers to how equipment, shelves and other furnishings are placed and the relationship between them. In a retail setting, accessibility is an important aspect of layout. For example, the grid layout used by supermarkets with long aisles and gondolas at the end displaying premium merchandise or promotional items, minimises the time customers spend in the environment and makes productive use of available space.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, C.M. and Mitchell, R., ''Wine Marketing: A Practical Guide'', p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; The gondola, so favoured by supermarkets, is an example of a retail design feature known as a ''merchandise outpost'' and which refers to special displays, typically at or near the end of an aisle, whose purpose is to stimulate [[impulse purchase|impulse purchasing]] or to complement other products in the vicinity. For example, the meat cabinet at the supermarket might use a merchandise outpost to suggest a range of marinades or spice rubs to complement particular cuts of meat. As a generalisation, merchandise outposts are updated regularly so that they maintain a sense of novelty.&lt;ref&gt;"Interior Design Tips: 6 Steps to Design Your Retail Shop", ''Retail Shop Design'', &lt;Online: https://retailshopdesign.com.sg/interior-design-tips-retail-design-layout&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ziethaml et al., layout affects how easy or difficult it is to navigate through a system. Signs and symbols provide cues for directional navigation and also inform about appropriate behaviour within a store. Functionality refers to extent to which the equipment and layout meet the goals of the customer.&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V. A., Bitner, M. J. and Gremler, D. D., ''Services Marketing: Integrating Customer Focus Across the Firm'', 5th ed., Boston, MA, McGraw Hill, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the case of supermarkets, the customer's goal may be to minimise the amount of time spent finding items and waiting at the check-out, while a customer in a retail mall may wish to spend more time exploring the range of stores and merchandise. With respect to functionality of layout, retail designers consider three key issues; circulation&amp;nbsp;– design for traffic-flow and that encourages customers to traverse the entire store; coordination&amp;nbsp;– design that combines goods and spaces in order to suggest customer needs and convenience&amp;nbsp;– design that arranges items to create a degree of comfort and access for both customers and employees.&lt;ref&gt;Aghazadeh,  S., "Layout Strategies for Retail Operations:  A Case Study", ''Management Research News'', Vol. 28, no. 10, 2005, pp. 31–46&lt;/ref&gt;

The way that brands are displayed is also part of the overall retail design. Where a product is placed on the shelves has implications for purchase likelihood as a result of visibility and access. Products placed too high or too low on the shelves may not turn over as quickly as those placed at eye level.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, C.M. and Mitchell, R., ''Wine Marketing: A Practical Guide'', pp. 182–83&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to access, store designers are increasingly giving consideration to access for disabled and elderly customers.

[[File:Çayyolu Metro 5.JPG|thumb|left|Navigational floor signs are commonly used in complex environments such as shopping malls and department stores]]

Through sensory stimulation retailers can engage maximum emotional impact between a brand and its consumers by relating to both profiles; the goal and experience. Purchasing behaviour can be influenced through the physical evidence detected by the senses of touch, smell, sight, taste and sound.&lt;ref name="Bailey, P. 2015"/&gt; Supermarkets offer taste testers to heighten the sensory experience of brands. Coffee shops allow the aroma of coffee to waft into streets so that passers-by can appreciate the smell and perhaps be lured inside. Clothing garments are placed at arms' reach, allowing customers to feel the different textures of clothing.&lt;ref name="Bailey, P. 2015"&gt;Bailey, P. (2015, April). Marketing to the senses: A multisensory strategy to align the brand touchpoints. Admap, 2-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Retailers understand that when customers interact with products or handle the merchandise, they are more likely to make a purchase.

Within the retail environment, different spaces may be designed for different purposes. Hard floors, such as wooden floors, used in public areas, contrast with carpeted fitting rooms, which are designed to create a sense of homeliness when trying on garments. [[Peter Alexander (fashion designer)|Peter Alexander]], retailer of sleep ware, is renowned for using scented candles in retail stores.

Ambient conditions, such as lighting, temperature and music, are also part of the overall retail environment.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, P. (2015, April). Marketing to the senses: A multi sensory strategy to align the brand touchpoints., 2-7.&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for a retail store to play music that relates to their target market. Studies have found that "positively valenced music will stimulate more thoughts and feeling than negatively valenced music", hence, positively valenced music will make the waiting time feel longer to the customer than negatively valenced music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hul|first=Michael K.|last2=Dube|first2=Laurette|last3=Chebat|first3=Jean-Charles|date=1997-03-01|title=The impact of music on consumers' reactions to waiting for services|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022435997900166|journal=Journal of Retailing|volume=73|issue=1|pages=87–104|doi=10.1016/S0022-4359(97)90016-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a retail store, for example, changing the background music to a quicker tempo may influence the consumer to move through the space at a quicker pace, thereby improving traffic flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bitner|first=M.J.|year=1992|title=Servicescapes: The impact of physical surroundings on customers and employees|jstor=1252042|journal=The Journal of Marketing|pages=57–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence also suggests that playing music reduces the negative effects of waiting since it serves as a distraction.&lt;ref&gt;Hul, M.K., Dube, L. and Chebat, J-C.,  " The impact of music on consumers' reactions to waiting for services",  ''Journal of Retailing'', Vol. 73, no. 1, 1997, pp. 87–104&lt;/ref&gt; Jewellery stores like [[Michael Hill Jeweller|Michael Hill]] have dim lighting with a view to fostering a sense of intimacy.

The design of a retail store is critical when appealing to the intended market, as this is where first impressions are made. The overall servicescape can influence a consumer's perception of the quality of the store, communicating value in visual and symbolic ways. Certain techniques are used to create a consumer brand experience, which in the long run drives store loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;(Kazançcoglu &amp; Dirsehan, 2014 )&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shopper profiles==
Two different strands of research have investigated shopper behaviour. One strand is primarily concerned with shopper motivations. Another stream of research seeks to segment shoppers according to common, shared characteristics. To some extent, these streams of research are inter-related, but each stream offers different types of insights into shopper behaviour.

[[File:Embroidery and lace- their manufacture and history from the remotest antiquity to the present day. A handbook for amateurs, collectors and general readers (1888) (14593807460).jpg|thumb|People who shop for pleasure are known as recreational shoppers. The recreational shopper has its origins in the grand European shopping arcades. Pictured: The gentry in a Dutch lace shop in the 17th century]]

Babin et al. carried out some of the earliest investigations into shopper motivations and identified two broad motives: ''utilitarian'' and ''hedonic.'' Utilitarian motivations are task-related and rational. For the shopper with utilitarian motives, purchasing is a work-related task that is to be accomplished in the most efficient and expedient manner. On the other hand, hedonic motives refer to pleasure. The shopper with hedonic motivations views shopping as a form of escapism where they are free to indulge fantasy and freedom. Hedonic shoppers are more involved in the shopping experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24098851 |doi=10.1086/209376|title=Work and/or Fun: Measuring Hedonic and Utilitarian Shopping Value|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=20|issue=4|pages=644|year=1994|last1=Babin|first1=Barry J.|last2=Darden|first2=William R.|last3=Griffin|first3=Mitch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many different shopper profiles can be identified. Retailers develop customised segmentation analyses for each unique outlet. However, it is possible to identify a number of broad shopper profiles. One of the most well-known and widely cited shopper typologies is that developed by Sproles and Kendal in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Durvasula, S., Lysonski, S. and Andrews, J.C. (1993), “Cross-cultural generalizability of a scale for profiling consumers’ decision-making styles”, ''The Journal of Consumer Affairs'', Vol. 27 No. 1, pp. 55–65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sproles, G.B. (1985), “From perfectionism to fadism: measuring consumers’ decision-making styles”, in Schnittgrund, K.P. (Ed.), ''American Council on Consumer Interests (ACCI), Conference Proceedings'', Columbia, MO, pp. 79–85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sproles, G. B. (1983). Conceptualisation and measurement of optimal consumer decision making. ''Journal of Consumer Affairs'', Vol. 17 No. 2, pp. 421–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Sproles and Kendall's consumer typology has been shown to be relatively consistent across time and across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1080/09593969.2014.911199|title=Consumer innovativeness and consumer decision styles: A confirmatory and segmentation analysis|journal=The International Review of Retail, Distribution and Consumer Research|volume=25|pages=35–54|year=2015|last1=Mishra|first1=Anubhav A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jain, R. and Sharma, A., "A Review on Sproles &amp; Kendall's Consumer Style Inventory (CSI) for Analyzing Decision Making Styles of Consumers", ''Indian Journal of Marketing'', Vol. 43, no. 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Their typology is based on the consumer's approach to making purchase decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Sproles, G. B., &amp; Kendall, E. L., "A methodology for profiling consumers' decision-marking styles", ''Journal of Consumer Affairs'', Vol., 20 No. 2, 1986, pp. 267–79&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Quality conscious/Perfectionist''': Quality-consciousness is characterised by a consumer's search for the very best quality in products; quality conscious consumers tend to shop systematically making more comparisons and shopping around.
* '''Brand-conscious''': Brand-consciousness is characterised by a tendency to buy expensive, well-known brands or designer labels. Those who score high on brand-consciousness tend to believe that the higher prices are an indicator of quality and exhibit a preference for department stores or top-tier retail outlets.
* '''Recreation-conscious/ Hedonistic''': Recreational shopping is characterised by the consumer's engagement in the purchase process. Those who score high on recreation-consciousness regard shopping itself as a form of enjoyment.
* '''Price-conscious''': A consumer who exhibits price-and-value consciousness. Price-conscious shoppers carefully shop around seeking lower prices, sales or discounts and are motivated by obtaining the best value for money
* '''Novelty/fashion-conscious''': characterised by a consumer's tendency to seek out new products or new experiences for the sake of excitement; who gain excitement from seeking new things; they like to keep up-to-date with fashions and trends, variety-seeking is associated with this dimension.
* '''Impulsive''': Impulsive consumers are somewhat careless in making purchase decisions, buy on the spur of the moment and are not overly concerned with expenditure levels or obtaining value. Those who score high on impulsive dimensions tend not to be engaged with the object at either a cognitive or emotional level.
* '''Confused (by over-choice)''': characterised by a consumer's confusion caused by too many product choices, too many stores or an overload of product information; tend to experience information overload.
* '''Habitual / brand loyal''': characterised by a consumer's tendency to follow a routine purchase pattern on each purchase occasion; consumers have favourite brands or stores and have formed habits in choosing; the purchase decision does not involve much evaluation or shopping around.

Some researchers have adapted Sproles and Kendall's methodology for use in specific countries or cultural groups.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, H. H., Sauer, N. E., and Becker, C., "Investigating the relationship between product involvement and consumer decision-making styles", ''Journal of Consumer Behaviour''. Vol. 5, 2006 342–354.&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer decision styles are important for retailers and marketers because they describe behaviours that are relatively stable over time and for this reason, they are useful for market segmentation.

==Retail format: types of retail outlet==

The ''retail format'' (also known as the ''retail formula'') influences the consumer's store choice and addresses the consumer's expectations. At its most basic level, a retail format is a simple [[marketplace]], that is; a location where goods and services are exchanged. In some parts of the world, the retail sector is still dominated by small family-run stores, but large [[retail chains]] are increasingly dominating the sector, because they can exert considerable buying power and pass on the savings in the form of lower prices. Many of these large retail chains also produce their own private labels which compete alongside manufacturer brands. Considerable consolidation of retail stores has changed the retail landscape, transferring power away from wholesalers and into the hands of the large retail chains.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinides, E., "The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing", ''Journal of Marketing Management'', Vol. 22, 2006, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain and Europe, the retail sale of goods is designated as a ''[[services marketing|service activity]].'' The European Service Directive applies to all retail trade including periodic markets, street traders and peddlers.

===Retail type by product===

Retail stores may be classified by the type of product carried:

; Food retailers
Retailers carrying highly perishable foodstuffs such as meat, dairy and fresh produce typically require cold storage facilities. Consumers purchase food products on a very regular purchase cycle&amp;nbsp;– e.g. daily, weekly or monthly.
; Softline retailers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.valueline.com/Tools/Educational_Articles/Stocks/The_World_of_Retail__Hardlines_vs__Softlines.aspx | title=The World of Retail: Hardlines vs. Softlines | publisher=Value Line | accessdate=22 May 2014 | author=Ferrara, J. Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/soft-merchandising-26175.html | title=What is Soft Merchandising? | publisher=Houston Chronicle | accessdate=22 May 2014 | author=Time, Forest}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Softline retailers sell goods that are consumed after a single use, or have a limited life (typically under three years) in they are normally consumed. Soft goods include [[clothing]], other [[fabrics]], [[footwear]], [[toiletries]], [[cosmetics]], [[medicines]] and [[stationery]].
; Grocery and convenience retail
Grocery stores, including supermarkets and hypermarkets, along with convenience stores carry a mix of food products and consumable household items such as detergents, cleansers, personal hygiene products. Consumer consumables are collectively known as fast-moving-consumer goods (FMCG) and represent the lines most often carried by supermarkets, grocers and convenience stores. For consumers, these are regular purchases and for the retailer, these products represent high turnover product lines. Grocery stores and convenience stores carry similar lines, but a convenience store is often open at times that suit its clientele and may be located for ease of access.
; Hardline retailers
Retailers selling consumer durables are sometimes known as ''hardline retailers''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.investorwords.com/2282/hard_goods.html | title=hard goods | publisher=Investor Words | accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – [[automobiles]], [[Home appliance|appliances]], [[electronics]], [[furniture]], [[sporting goods]], [[lumber]], etc., and parts for them. Goods that do not quickly wear out and provide utility over time. For the consumer, these items often represent major purchase decisions. Consumers purchase durables over longer purchase decision cycles. For instance, the typical consumer might replace their family car every 5 years, and their home computer every 4 years.
; Specialist retailers
Specialist retailers operate in many industries such as the arts e.g. green grocers, [[contemporary art galleries]], [[bookstores]], [[handicrafts]], [[musical instruments]], [[gift shops]].

===Retail types by marketing strategy===
Types of retail outlet by marketing strategy include:
;Arcade
A shopping arcade refers to a group of retail outlets operating under a covered walkway. Arcades are similar to shopping malls, although they typically comprise a smaller number of outlets. Shopping arcades were the evolutionary precursor to the shopping mall, and were very fashionable in the late 19th-century. Stylish men and women would promenade around the arcade, stopping to window shop, making purchases and also taking light refreshments in one of the arcade's tea-rooms. Arcades offered fashionable men and women opportunities to 'be seen' and to socialise in a relatively safe environment. Arcades continue to exist as a distinct type of retail outlet. Historic 19th-century arcades have become popular tourist attractions in cities around the world. [[Amusement arcade]]s, also known as penny arcades in the US, are more modern incarnation of the eighteenth and nineteenth century shopping arcade.
; [[Anchor store]]
An anchor store (also known as draw tenant or anchor tenant) is a larger store with a good reputation used by shopping mall management to attract a certain volume of shoppers to a precinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsc.org/srch/lib/SCDefinitions99.pdf "ICSC Shopping Center Definitions: Basic Configurations and Types for the United States"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621081346/http://www.icsc.org/srch/lib/SCDefinitions99.pdf |date=2007-06-21 }}, [[International Council of Shopping Centers]]. Accessed July 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Bazaar
The term, '[[bazaar]]' can have multiple meanings. It may refer to a Middle-Eastern market place while a 'penny bazaar' refers to a retail outlet that specialises in inexpensive or discounted merchandise. In the United States a bazaar can mean a "rummage sale" which describes a charity fundraising event held by a church or other community organization and in which either donated used goods are made available for sale. 
;Boutique
A [[Boutique]] is a small store offering a select range of fashionable goods or accessories. The term, 'boutique', in retail and services, appears to be taking on a broader meaning with popular references to retail goods and retail services such as boutique hotels, boutique beers (i.e. craft beers), boutique investments etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/boutique|title=Definition of BOUTIQUE|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pfficeworks inside.jpg|thumb|Australia's [[Officeworks]] is a category killer, retailing everything for the home office or small commercial office; stationery, furniture, electronics, communications devices, copying, printing and photography services, coffee, tea and light snacks]]
;Category killer
By supplying a wide assortment in a single category for lower prices a [[category killer]] retailer can "kill" that category for other retailers.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/category%20killer&lt;/ref&gt; A category killer is a specialist store that dominates a given category. Toys "R" Us, established in 1957, is thought to be the first category killer, dominating the children's toys and games market.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfeld, K.T., ''Time'', 19 October 1998&lt;/ref&gt; For a few categories, such as electronics, home hardware, office supplies and children's toys, the products are displayed at the centre of the store and a sales person will be available to address customer queries and give suggestions when required. Rival retail stores are forced to reduce their prices if a category killer enters the market in a given geographic area. Examples of category killers include [[Toys "R" Us]] and Australia's [[Bunnings Warehouse|Bunnings]] (hardware, DIY and outdoor supplies) and [[Officeworks]] (stationery and supplies for the home office and small office). Some category killers redefine the category. For example, Australia's Bunnings began as a hardware outlet, but now supplies a broad range of goods for the home handyman or small tradesman, including kitchen cabinetry, craft supplies, gardening needs and outdoor furniture. Similarly Officeworks straddles the boundary between stationery supplies, office furniture and digital communications devices in its quest to provide for all the needs of the retail consumer and the small, home office.

; Concept store
Concept stores are similar to speciality stores in that they are very small in size, and only stock a limited range of brands or a single brand. They are typically operated by the brand that controls them. Example: [[L'Occitane en Provence|L'OCCITANE en Provence]]. The limited size and offering of L'OCCITANE's stores is too small to be considered a speciality store. However, a concept store goes beyond merely selling products, and instead offers an immersive customer experience built around the way that a brand fits with the customer's lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;"Rethinking why Brands are Embracing the Concept Store", ''The Guardian'', 9 July 2014 [https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/jul/09/retail-brands-concept-store-shopping Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include Apple's concept stores, [[Kit Kat]]'s concept store in Japan.

Pricing is usually not the priority when consumers are deciding upon a speciality store; factors such as branding image, selection choice, and purchasing assistance are seen as important.&lt;ref name=essential/&gt; They differ from [[department store]]s and [[supermarket]]s which carry a wide range of merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=William M Pride |author2=Robert James Hughes |author3=Jack R.

* [[Big-box store]]s&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;– encompass larger department, discount, general merchandise, and warehouse stores.
* Second-hand retail
{{main|Second-hand shop}}
{{see also|Charity shop}}
: Some shops sell second-hand goods. In the case of a [[non-profit organization|nonprofit]] shop, the public donates goods to the shop to be sold. In [[give-away shop]]s goods can be taken free.
: [[Pawnbroker]]s Another form is the [[pawnbroker|pawnshop]], in which goods are sold that were used as collateral for loans. There are also "[[consignment]]" shops, which are where a person can place an item in a store and if it sells, the person gives the shop owner a percentage of the sale price. The advantage of selling an item this way is that the established shop gives the item exposure to more potential buyers. [[Online shopping|E-tailers]] like OLX and Quikr also offer second-hand goods.

Retailers can opt for a format as each provides different retail mix to its customers based on their customer demographics, lifestyle and purchase behaviour. An effective format will dtermine how products are display products, as well as how target customers are attracted.

==Challenges==
To achieve and maintain a foothold in an existing market, a prospective retail establishment must [[Barriers to entry|overcome the following hurdles]]:
* [[Regulations|Regulatory]] barriers including
** Restrictions on real estate purchases, especially as imposed by [[Municipality|local governments]] and against "big-box" [[Big box|chain retailers]];
** Restrictions on foreign investment in retailers, in terms of both absolute amount of financing provided and percentage share of voting stock (e.g. [[common stock]]) purchased;
* Unfavourable [[Tax code|taxation structures]], especially those designed to penalize or keep out "big box" retailers (see "Regulatory" above);
* Absence of developed supply chain and integrated IT management;
* High [[Competition (economics)|competitiveness]] among existing market participants and resulting low [[profit margin]]s, caused in part by
** Constant advances in product design resulting in constant threat of product obsolescence and price declines for existing [[inventory]]; and
* Lack of properly educated and/or trained work force, often including management, caused in part by loss in Business.
** Lack of [[Education in the United States|educational infrastructure]] enabling prospective market entrants to respond to the above challenges.

[[File:US Retail Sales.png|thumb|U.S. Monthly Retail Sales, 1992–2010]]
Since 1951, the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] has published the Retail Sales report every month. It is a measure of [[consumer spending]], an important indicator of the US [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. Retail firms provide data on the dollar value of their retail sales and inventories. A [[Sampling (statistics)|sample]] of 12,000 firms is included in the final [[Statistical survey|survey]] and 5,000 in the advanced one. The advanced estimated data is based on a subsample from the US CB complete retail &amp; [[food service]]s sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/retail/index.html|title=US Census Bureau Monthly &amp; Annual Retail Trade|website=www.census.gov|date=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Europe===
In 2011, the grocery market in six countries of [[Central Europe]] was worth nearly €107bn, 2.8% more than the previous year when expressed in local currencies. The increase was generated foremost by the discount stores and supermarket segments, and was driven by the skyrocketing prices of foodstuffs. This information is based on the latest PMR report entitled Grocery retail in Central Europe 2012&lt;ref name="http://www.pmrpublications.com/product/Grocery-retail-Central-Europe-2012"&gt; Grocery retail in Central Europe 2012 [http://www.pmrpublications.com/product/Grocery-retail-Central-Europe-2012 Retail in Central Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World===
[[File:Zuerich Migroshochhaus 5.jpg|thumb|The two largest supermarkets chains in [[Switzerland]], [[Migros]] and [[Coop (Switzerland)|Coop]], are cooperatives.]]

National accounts show a combined total of retail and wholesale trade, with hotels and restaurants. in 2012 the sector provides over a fifth of GDP in tourist-oriented island economies, as well as in other major countries such as Brazil, Pakistan, Russia, and Spain. In all four of the latter countries, this fraction is an increase over 1970, but there are other countries where the sector has declined since 1970, sometimes in absolute terms, where other sectors have replaced its role in the economy. In the United States the sector has declined from 19% of GDP to 14%, though it has risen in absolute terms from $4,500 to $7,400 per capita per year. In China the sector has grown from 7.3% to 11.5%, and in India even more, from 8.4% to 18.7%. Emarketer predicts China will have the largest retail market in the world in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.techinasia.com/asia-ecommerce-spending-1-trillion-dollars-2016|title= Asia’s ecommerce spending to hit record $1 trillion this year – but most of that is China|first= Steven|last= Millward|date= 18 August 2016|accessdate= 18 August 2016|work= Tech in Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5147">The '''Reward Work Act''' of 2018 ([https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2605/text S.2605] and [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr6096 HR 6096]) is a proposed United States [[Act of Congress]] to ban unjustified stock buy-backs, and to require every listed company enable employees to elect one-third of the [[board of directors]]. The Bill was sponsored initially by Senators [[Tammy Baldwin]], [[Elizabeth Warren]] and [[Brian Schatz]] in March 2018, and joined in April 2018 by [[Kirsten Gillibrand]]. It was sponsored in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in June 2018 by [[Keith Ellison]] and [[Ro Khanna]].

==Contents==
Section 2 prohibits stock buybacks on the open market.

Section 3 requires one-third board representation for employees of listed companies. Specifically, this amends §12b of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] (15 USC 78l(b)(1)) to add "No issuer may register securities on a national exchange unless at least 1⁄3 of the issuer’s directors are chosen by the issuing company’s employees in a one-employee-one-vote election process." It then requires the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], consulting with the [[National Labor Relations Board]] to make regulations ensuring democratic election processes, and 1/3 of an issuer's board to "be composed of employee representatives within 2 years of the date of enactment of this Act."

==Reception==
The problem of stock buybacks as a source of US income inequality had become highly visible as a result of the award-winning 2014 publication of the ''Harvard Business Review'' article, "Profits Without Prosperity: Stock Buybacks Manipulate the Market and Leave Most Americans Worse Off," by [[William Lazonick]].&lt;ref&gt;William Lazonick, "Profits Without Prosperity" ''Harvard Business Review'', September 2014: 46-55 [https://hbr.org/search?term=william+lazonick]&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was welcomed by the [[Roosevelt Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;'STATEMENT: Financial Economy Experts at Roosevelt Institute React to Bill Introduced by Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) to Ban Stock Buybacks' (22 March 2018) [http://rooseveltinstitute.org/statement-financial-economy-experts-roosevelt-institute-react-bill-introduced-by-senator-tammy-baldwin-d-wi-ban-stock-buybacks/ Roosevelt Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; and media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. D Matthews, 'Workers don’t have much say in corporations.

(6 April 2018) [https://www.vox.com/2018/4/6/17086720/poll-corporate-board-democracy-worker-council-codetermination-union-labor Vox] and G Tyler, 'Codetermination Enters The American Political Debate' (20 April 2018) [https://www.socialeurope.eu/codetermination-enters-the-american-political-debate Social Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also gathered endorsements from the following groups:

*[[AFL-CIO]]
*[[Communication Workers of America]]
*[[Public Citizen]]
*[[Take on Wall Street]]
*[[Americans for Financial Reform]]

A Civis poll found people in "the “lean Democrat” category voted 75% in favor of the question, and just 9% opposed. Around 43% of the “lean Republican” category supported the concept, while 31% opposed, and the pure Republican category saw 4% more opposed than in favor. But overall, a clear majority of people favor the concept."&lt;ref&gt;E Anzelotti, 'Want Fairer Workplaces?

A '''small cap company''' is a company whose [[market capitalization]] ([[share (finance)|share]]s x value of each share) is small, under $1 billion.

==Overview==

A small cap company typically has under $1 billion under control and are hence considered small companies. Small companies generally are not able to secure the best ([[prime rate|prime]]) borrowing rates and wield reduced power, including a smaller [[market share]]. Being small, they are also less financially stable than larger companies, and are more likely to become [[bankrupt]]. However, they do generally have more [[growth potential]] and over time have greater but more volatile expected returns.

&lt;!--- Don't mess with this line! ---&gt;&lt;!--- Write your article below this line ---&gt;
'''Stu Strumwasser''' (born March 25, 1966) is an [[List of American novelists|American novelist]], entrepreneur and [[Investment banking|investment banker.]]  He is a graduate of [[Cornell University]] where he studied Marketing/Advertising and Creative Writing.  His novel, THE ORGAN BROKER, is a depiction of the global black market for organs—a consequence of the organ shortage crisis in American and around the world—and establishes Strumwasser as a thought leader on the bioethical issues that he has written about for publications like [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]].

== The Novels ==
Strumwasser writes thrillers with underlying [[Political sociology|socio-political themes]].  His first novel, A METAL SKY, was a coming of age story combined with an exposé of fundraisers for police unions.  THE ORGAN BROKER, a novel about a black market organ broker, will be released by the Arcade Imprint of [[Skyhorse Publishing]] in May 2015.  While the book is a novel, the author has developed a secondary agenda of advocating for those in need of organ donations.  In the [http://www.salon.com/2014/03/23/the_tragedy_of_american_organ_donations_so_many_more_people_could_be_saved/ Salon.com article], published in march of 2013, he said, “The tragic aspect of this particular shortage is that there are plenty of organs and there are things we can do."&lt;ref&gt;Salon.com, "The Tragedy of American Organ Donations: So Many More People Could Be Saved," Sunday March 23, 2014, Stu Strumwasser.&lt;/ref&gt; Strumwasser calls on Congress to enact more modern legislation related to the issue of organ transplantation.  In his next book, THE AMERICAN PARTY, Strumwasser takes on broken government and the unfolding oligarchy being created by the two major political parties.

== Career ==

=== Wall Street ===
Strumwasser worked on Wall St. from 1990 until 2005 in the area of wealth management, serving as a VP and Director at major firms including [[Paine Webber]] (now [[UBS]]) and [[Oppenheimer Holdings|Oppenheimer &amp; Co]].&lt;ref&gt;LinkedIn page of Stu Strumwasser, http://www.linkedin.com/in/stustrumwasser&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Channeling Owen ===
For most of the time that Strumwasser worked on Wall Street he concurrently pursued a career as an aspiring novelist and also as the primary songwriter and drummer in the indie rock band Channeling Owen.  In a feature article in Forbes ASAP (a 90s technology supplement to Forbes) freelance journalist David Freedman noted that, "Stu Strumwasser, Channeling Owen's drummer, principal songwriter, and administrator..." was, "obsessed with making it in rock and roll since he was 6."&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Sonic Press, February 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Freedman's article contrasted the release of a new record by Strumwasser's indie rock band and MCA recording artist Blink-182 in a changing landscape for the music business.  
In 1999 the band was referred to by Electronic Sonic Press as, "… next in the great lineage of soul-searching groups such as Live, Collective Soul, and Creed, not to mention Jars of Clay."&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Sonic Press, February 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  Heard magazine called the band's first full-length release, Small-minded Voodoo Theories, "well executed, displaying both great production techniques and a flair for solid songwriting,"&lt;ref&gt;heARd Magazine, January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  and Modernrock.com referenced Strumwasser's songwriting as, "full of historical references, poetic metaphors, and literary allusions."&lt;ref&gt;Modernrock.com, Glennie Rabin, November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  On 1/12/00, the band's song,"Scared Of me," was featured in the Dawson's Creek episode "Barefoot at Capefest" on the [[The WB|WB network]].&lt;ref&gt;Dawson's Creek, WB Network, January 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, the band did not succeed in becoming a profitable venture and eventually broke up in 2003.

=== Snow Beverages ===
In late 2005 Struumwasser left Wall Street to found Snow Beverages, makers of natural soda.&lt;ref name=Mcauliffe&gt;{{cite news|last1=McAuliffe|first1=Bill|title=Snow drifts into Cities from the East in a bottle (interview)|url=http://search.proquest.com/news/docview/427776534/897B27F171004AC9PQ/2?accountid=10226|accessdate=11 May 2015|publisher=Star Tribune (Minneapolis)|date=18 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Erikson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Erikson|first1=Chris|title=On the Bubble - Wizards of Fizz Aim New Sodas at Mature Tastes|url=http://search.proquest.com/news/docview/334294498/897B27F171004AC9PQ/1?accountid=10226|accessdate=11 May 2015|publisher=New York Post|date=27 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "To get Snow Beverages in gear, Stu Strumwasser tapped his savings..."&lt;ref&gt;Crain's NY, Tina Traster, Small Business Report, January 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Strumwasser has been a vegetarian since the age of 14 (in 1980) and was determined to manufacture and distribute a natural alternative to commercial and unhealthy soda.  In December 2005, with the brand merely a few months old, the Wall Street Journal referenced it as one of the new natural sodas with "catchy names such as [[Fizzy Lizzy]], GUS, Steaze, IZZE, or Snow..."&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, Christina Cheddar Berk, Dow Jones Newswire, December 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Launched initially as a single-flavor natural mint soda, Snow evolved in 2007 to add a, "few new additions to the fizzy family"&lt;ref&gt;Beverage World Magazine, March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 Snow, "dropped mint and launched three familiar flavors."&lt;ref&gt;New York Daily News, Phyllis Furman, cover of the "Your Money" section, Monday, June 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite meaningful distribution, the product line struggled to find an audience with consumers.  In 2011 Strumwasser left the company which soon after ceased operations.

=== Tengrade ===
In 2011 Strumwasser founded a new company, Tengrade, the social rating tool, designed to enable users to get, or give, Real Opinions, on anything, from friends and people like them, directly on Facebook or Twitter.  [[Fox Business Network|Fox Business Channel]] called Tengrade, "A new, one-stop rating tool for everything from cars and restaurants to hotels and pizza."&lt;ref&gt;The Closing Bell With Liz Claman, Fox News Channel, August 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Green Circle Capital:
Concurrent to creating Tengrade Strumwasser also returned to Wall Street, but in a different capacity.  Armed with the experience of having been an entrepreneur he aimed to assist other early-stage companies with raising capital, which he now does as Senior Managing Director of Green Circle.

'''Søren Kristian Toubro''' (27 February 1906 – 4 March 1982) was a Danish engineer who co-founded [[Larsen &amp; Toubro]], an [[India]]-based [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]].&lt;ref name="the_hindu_giant"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early days in India ==
Toubro began his career as a Civil Engineer. As an employee of [[FLSmidth|F. L. Smidth &amp; Co.]] of [[Copenhagen]], he came to India in 1934 to erect and commission the equipment supplied to the [[Madukkarai]] Cement Works (near [[Coimbatore]]) and the [[Rohri]] Cement Factory (near the [[Sukkur Barrage]] in [[Sindh]]).&lt;ref name="the_hindu_formula"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime after landing in India, he read a report in the Bombay Chronicle that quoted [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] as saying: "(I am) not leading a movement to rid India of its white colonial masters in order to substitute them with brown ones." Toubro felt that such an India would "offer great opportunities to anyone with modern technological and management skills".&lt;ref name="the_hindu_formula"/&gt;

== Larsen &amp; Toubro ==
In 1938, Toubro partnered with his former schoolmate [[Henning Holck-Larsen]], a chemical engineer and a fellow Smidth's employee, to establish [[Larsen &amp; Toubro]]. The idea of L&amp;T was conceived during a holiday in [[Matheran]], a hill station near [[Bombay]] (now Mumbai).&lt;ref name="the_hindu_formula"/&gt; Holck-Larsen was a risk-taker while Toubro was more conservative.&lt;ref name="the_hindu_giant"/&gt; Larsen &amp; Toubro saw opportunities in India at a time, when few Europeans had realised the country's potential for industrial growth.

The first office of L&amp;T, located in Bombay, was so small that only one of them could use it a time.&lt;ref name="larsentoubro_evolution"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, L&amp;T represented Danish dairy equipment manufacturers. However, the Danish imports were restricted during the [[World War II]], forcing L&amp;T to start a small workshop that provided servicing and undertook small jobs. The imports stopped after the [[Operation Weserübung|German invasion of Denmark]], forcing L&amp;T to start manufacturing dairy equipment indigenously, a move that was successful.&lt;ref name="larsentoubro_evolution"/&gt;

Seeing opportunity in ship repair during wartime, Larsen and Toubro formed a new company called Hilda Ltd. Around this time, L&amp;T also started two repair and fabrication shops. The internment of German engineers who were supposed to build a soda ash plant for the [[Tata Group|Tatas]] provided L&amp;T another new opportunity.&lt;ref name="larsentoubro_evolution"/&gt;

In 1944, Larsen and Toubro established Engineering Construction &amp; Contracts (ECC). L&amp;T started collaborating with international companies around this time. In 1945, L&amp;T signed an agreement with the [[Caterpillar Tractor Company]] of USA for marketing earthmoving equipment. L&amp;T also started representing British manufacturers of equipment used to manufacture a variety of products including biscuits, glass, hydrogenated oils and soaps.&lt;ref name="larsentoubro_evolution"/&gt;

At the end of World War II, the war-surplus Caterpillar equipment were available in bulk at low prices. However, L&amp;T lacked the money to purchase them. Therefore, Larsen and Toubro decided to raise additional equity capital, and as a result, Larsen &amp; Toubro Private Limited was established on 7 February 1946.&lt;ref name="larsentoubro_evolution"/&gt; After India gained independence in 1947, L&amp;T set up offices in [[Calcutta]], [[Madras]] and New Delhi. In 1948, L&amp;T acquired {{convert|55|acre|ha}} of undeveloped land in the [[Powai]] suburb of Mumbai.
 
Larsen and Toubro gradually transformed L&amp;T into a large business house with diverse interests. A 2006 article in [[The Hindu]] described Toubro as follows:&lt;ref name="the_hindu_formula"/&gt;
{{Quote|A workaholic, he expected the same of others. A hard taskmaster with a schoolmasterly attitude to training he may have been, but the young he mentored still remember the lessons he taught: that no effort was too great to ensure customer satisfaction, that there must be attention to detail in the quest for perfection, and that there must be pride in whatever was being done.}}

Soren K Toubro served as the director of L&amp;T from 1946 to 1981, and retired from active management in 1962–63.&lt;ref name="larsentoubro_evolution"/&gt; He continued to serve on the L&amp;T and ECC board of directors till 1981.

== Last years ==
After spending nearly five decades in India, Toubro retired to Denmark in 1981, and died there next year.&lt;ref name="the_hindu_formula"/&gt; Toubro had a large house and estate in [[Kodaikanal]], where his wife spent her last days before his death.

The Toubro Training Centre, located in the [[Manapakkam]] campus of L&amp;T's ECC division, is named after him. The Toubro Construction Technology Centre, is also named after him, and was inaugurated by his son Ole K. Toubro in 2006.&lt;ref name="the_hindu_formula"/&gt;

'''''The New Market Wizards''''' is a book by [[Jack D. Schwager]] published on January 26, 1992 by [[HarperCollins]]. The format is very similar to his 1988 ''[[Market Wizards]]'', with a new selection of interviews with super-traders.

As in the previous volume, Schwager starts with a frank discussion of his own trading experience, followed by a surprising diversion comparing [[Saddam Hussein]]'s invasion of Kuwait with a trade that went wrong.

The rest of the book is broken into five parts including interviews with different types of traders and brief discussions of the lessons to be learnt from them, plus a part on trading psychology and a final part summarising the wisdom gained from all of the interviewees in 42 golden rules.
