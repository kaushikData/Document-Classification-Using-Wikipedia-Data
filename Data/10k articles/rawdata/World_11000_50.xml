'''''Amazone zu Pferde''''' ("Amazon on horseback") is an outdoor 1895 bronze equestrian statue by Prussian sculptor [[Louis Tuaillon]], installed in [[Tiergarten (park)|Tiergarten]] in [[Berlin]], Germany. The name of the artwork refers to the [[Amazons|Amazon]] warriors, a nation of "all women" warriors of [[Iranian Peoples|Iranian]] origin (related to [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]]), who inhabited the regions around the [[Black Sea]] and [[Eurasian steppes]] from the 2nd millennium BC until the start of the [[Early Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women across the Ancient World", p. 41, Adrienne Mayor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Black Sea: The Birthplace of Civilisation and Barbarism", p. 106, Neal Ascherson&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bent Familia'''''  is a 1997  drama set in [[Tunisia]] about Amina (Leila Nassim) a married [[Muslim]] woman living in [[Tunis]] with her two daughters. Even though she is allowed certain freedoms as a Muslim woman this is curtailed when she meets her old friend from school called Aida acted by (Amel Hédhili).

A mother of two, Aida took a firm stand not to tolerate her husband's infidelities. She divorced and considers herself a liberated woman. Then there is their mutual friend Fatiha (Nadia Kaci), an intellectual who is adamant that she is going to leave Tunis and settle in the West. This strong triangle of friendship threatens Amina's husband, Majid (Raoul Ben Amor), another adulterer who tries to bring the might of the chauvinist side of Muslim society down on her. Directed by Nouri Bouzid, this well-shot film presents us with the very real problems of women in contemporary North Africa, but offers no easy solutions.

[[File:Capra, Francesco Londonio (1723–1786).jpg|thumb|300px|Painting from c. 1760 by [[Francesco Londonio]] (1723–1786), showing a goat of Bionda dell'Adamello type, with typical coat and facial markings ([[Accademia Carrara]], [[Bergamo]])]]
The '''Bionda dell'Adamello''' is an indigenous [[breed]] of [[goat|domestic goat]] from the [[Val Camonica]] in the [[province of Brescia]], in [[Lombardy]] in northern Italy. It takes its name from the [[massif]] of the [[Adamello]], part of the [[Adamello-Presanella alps|Adamello-Presanella]] subsection of the [[Rhaetian Alps]]. It is raised mainly in the Val Camonica, the [[Val Saviore]] and the mountains of Brescia; some are found in neighbouring areas of the [[provinces of Italy|provinces]] of [[province of Catania|Bergamo]] to the west and [[Trentino|Trento]] to the east.&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt; It was in the past known simply as the '''Capra Bionda''' or as the '''Mustàscia'''.&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt; 

==History==

The breed appears to be of ancient origin. While it shares some characteristics with the Swiss [[Toggenburger]], notably the "[[Swiss markings]]" (white facial stripes, white lower limbs and peri-anal area), it was already established well before the importation of Toggenburg billies to the area, documented from the years before and after the [[Second World War]]. A painting from about 1760 by the [[Milan]]ese painter [[Francesco Londonio]] (1723–1786) shows a goat of Bionda dell'Adamello type, with typical coat and facial markings.&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt;  

The Bionda dell'Adamello is one of the forty-three autochthonous Italian goat breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the [[Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia]], the Italian national association of sheep- and goat-breeders.&lt;ref name=dm/&gt;&lt;ref name=aspa/&gt; The herd-book was activated in 1997.&lt;ref name=pulina/&gt; At the end of 2013 the registered population was variously reported as 3148&lt;ref name=aspa2/&gt; and as 2772.&lt;ref name=dad/&gt; 

==Use==

The [[goat's milk|milk]] yield per [[lactation]] of the Bionda dell'Adamello is {{nowrap|303 ± 108 litres}} for [[secondiparous]], and {{nowrap|361 ± 122 l}} for [[pluriparous]], nannies.&lt;ref name=aspa/&gt; The milk averages 3.16% fat and 2.97% [[protein]]. It is used mostly to make [[Mascarpì]], a kind of [[ricotta]], and the smoked [[caprino cheese]] [[Fatulì]], which has [[Prodotto alimentare tradizionale|PAT]] status and is listed in the [[Slow Food]] [[Ark of Taste]].&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt;

[[File:Caverio Map circa 1506.jpg|thumb|300px|The Caverio Map]]

The '''Caverio Map''' (also known as Caveri Map or Canerio Map) is a map drawn by [[Nicolay de Caveri]], circa 1506.
It is kept at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]] in Paris. 

It is drawn on parchment by hand and coloured. It is composed of ten sections or panels, the whole forming a rectangle measuring 2.25 by 1.15 metres.  This undated map was one of the primary sources used to make the [[Waldseemüller map]] in  1507. On the basis of this it is mostly dated to c. 1506. 
The map is signed with "Nicolay de Caveri Januensis". It was probably either made in [[Lisbon]] by the Genoese Canveri, or copied by him in Genoa from a Portuguese map very similar to the [[Cantino planisphere|Cantino map]], if not the Cantino map itself. The Cantino map was in Genoa toward the end of 1502 and presumably the following few years, when Caveri could have used it as the basis of his map.

Sanz (1961){{page needed|date=February 2016}} argued that the east coast of North America is drawn with surprising accuracy, especially "when we consider the general belief that the Europeans neither saw nor set foot on the beaches in the southern states of the present-day U.S.A. before [[Juan Ponce de León|Ponce de León]] arrived there in 1512 or 1513, [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in 1523, [[Lucas Vásquez de Ayllón]] in 1520-1524 or [[Esteban Gómez]] in 1525."

'''"Chcę znać swój grzech..."''' (I want to know my sin...) was the [[Poland|Polish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996]], performed in [[Polish language|Polish]] by [[Kasia Kowalska]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diggiloo.net/?1996pl Chcę znać swój grzech], Diggiloo.net. Retrieved 12 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The song is a dramatic ballad, with Kowalska asking a lover to tell her the reason for his coldness towards her. She refers to this reason as "my sin", and asks him to tell it to her "Only once/Before I lose you", claiming that if she knows this she will redouble her efforts to love him.

The song was performed twentieth on the night, following [[Iceland]]'s [[Anna Mjöll Ólafsdóttir|Anna Mjöll]] with "[[Sjúbídú]]" and preceding [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'s [[Amila Glamočak]] with "[[Za našu ljubav]]". At the close of voting, it had received 31 points, placing 15th in a field of 23.

The promotional video featured Kasia singing in a church, surrounded by candles

'''Christian Social Responsibility''' (CSR, '''Kristet Samhällsansvar''') was a [[lobbying|lobby]] organization that was founded in the mid-1950s in Sweden. The goal of the organisation was to get [[Christian]] politicians placed high up on the voting papers of the Swedish political parties. The CSR had a grassroots network of active members over the entire nation and produced their own material. 

The chairman of the organisation was [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre Party]] voter Sven Danell. [[Lewi Pethrus]], one of the founders of the [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democratic Party]] was the vice chairman. [[Birger Ekstedt]], later to become the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, was the secretary of the organisation.

On 22 June 2010, Diaconescu was arrested by the National Anti-corruption Agency (DNA) for extortion. Diaconescu was accused of having asked a mayor of a commune in Transylvania to take money in exchange for not publishing compromising data. A day later, he was arrested for 29 days, following the District 1 Court's decision. On 25 June, Diaconescu was released after Bucharest Court judges have upheld the decision of detention.

[[Antarctica]] has few permanent residents, and contains research stations and field camps that are staffed seasonally or year-round, and former [[whaling]] settlements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/science/can_you_live_in_antarctica.php Cool Antarctica: Who lives in Antarctica?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112000000/http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/science/can_you_live_in_antarctica.php |date=January 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest station, [[McMurdo Station]], has a summer population of about 1,000 people and a winter population of about 200.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nsf.gov/geo/plr/support/mcmurdo.jsp NSF: McMurdo Station]&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 29 nations, all signatory to the [[Antarctic Treaty]], send personnel to perform seasonal (summer) or year-round research on the continent and in its surrounding oceans. 

The population of persons doing and supporting scientific research on the continent and its nearby islands south of [[60th parallel south|60 degrees south]] latitude (the region covered by the Antarctic Treaty)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.aq/e/ats.htm|title=ATS - The Antarctic Treaty|author=|date=|website=www.ats.aq}}&lt;/ref&gt; varies from approximately 4,000 in summer to 1,000 in winter; in addition, approximately 1,000 personnel including ship's crew and scientists doing onboard research are present in the waters of the treaty region.

At least ten children have been born in West Antarctica. The first was [[Emilio Palma|Emilio Marcos Palma]], born on 7 January 1978 to [[Argentina|Argentine]] parents at [[Esperanza Base|Esperanza]], Hope Bay, near the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webecoist.com/2011/02/15/born-freezing-meet-antarcticas-first-citizen/|title=Born Freezing: Meet Antarctica's First Citizen - WebEcoist|author=|date=15 February 2011|website=webecoist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, [[Juan Pablo Camacho]] was born at the [[Villa Las Estrellas|Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva Base]], becoming the first [[Chile]]an born in Antarctica. Soon after, a girl, Gisella, was born at the same station. In 2001, ''National Geographic'' reported that eight children had been born at Esperanza alone.

The '''Embassy of Colombia''' to the [[Holy See]] is the [[diplomatic mission]] of the [[Republic of Colombia]] to the [[Holy See]]; it is headed by the [[Ambassador of Colombia to the Holy See]]. It is located in the [[Prati]] neighbourhood of the Municipio XVII of Rome, just outside [[Vatican City]], precisely at Via Cola di Rienzo, 285&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Misiones de Colombia en el Exterior: Santa Sede |url=https://tramites.cancilleria.gov.co/ciudadano/directorio/Misiones/enExterior.aspx |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Colombia)|Colombia, Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |accessdate=23 December 2012 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114084628/https://tramites.cancilleria.gov.co/ciudadano/directorio/Misiones/enExterior.aspx |archivedate=14 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the intersection of Via Silla, and it is serviced by the [[Ottaviano – San Pietro – Musei Vaticani (Rome Metro)|Ottaviano–San Pietro–Musei Vaticani]] [[Rome Metro|metro]] station and the Risorgimento [[Rome Tram|tram]] stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Via Cola di Rienzo, 285|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Ambasciata+Presso+la+S.+Sede+Colombia&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=41.906749,12.459869&amp;spn=0.008144,0.016801&amp;sll=38.804821,-77.236966&amp;sspn=2.183112,4.301147&amp;hq=Ambasciata+Presso+la+S.+Sede+Colombia&amp;radius=15000&amp;t=m&amp;z=16|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike all other embassies, the Embassy of Colombia near the Holy See is not located within the accredited entity, this is because of the size limitations of [[Vatican City]], all embassies accredited to the Holy See are located in Rome and are accredited to the Holy See and not to the Vatican City State proper.

The Ministry of Health and Environmental Protection of [[Austria]], established in 1972, is responsible for the coordination at the national level of all environmental protection efforts, addressing its efforts toward problems including [[waste disposal]], [[pollution]], [[noise]], [[sulfur dioxide]], and [[carbon monoxide]] levels, as well as emissions by the iron, steel, and ceramics industries. A toxic waste law enacted in 1984  established strict regulations for the collection, transport, and disposal of dangerous substances. 

The Austrian [[Government of Austria|government]] has imposed strict regulations on gas emissions, which helped to reduce sulfur dioxide by two-thirds over an eight-year period beginning in 1980. In 1992 Austria was among the 50 countries with the highest level of industrial carbon dioxide emissions, producing 56.6 million metric tons of emissions, or 7.29 m tons per capita. In 1996, the level rose to 59.3 million metric tons. In 2000, the total was 60.8 million metric tons.

== Environmental issues ==
===Pollution===
Austrians continue to fight the problem of [[acid rain]] which has damaged 25% of the country’s forests. In general, environmental legislation is based on the “polluter pays” principle. The water resources fund of the Ministry for Buildings and Technology distributed more than $20 billion for canalization and waste-water purification plants between 1959 and the early 1980s; the [[Danube river|Danube]] and the [[Mur River|Mur]] have been the special focus of efforts to improve water quality.

===Endangered species===
As of 2002, there were at least 83 species of mammals, 230 breeding and wintering bird species, and over 3,000 species of plants. According to a 2006 report issued by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN), threatened species included 5 types of mammals, 8 species of birds, 7 species of fish, 22 types of mollusks, 22 other invertebrates, and 3 species of plants. Endangered species include Freya’s [[damselfly]], the dusky large blue butterfly, [[slender-billed curlew]], [[bald ibis]], [[Huchen|Danube salmon]], and the [[European mink]]. About 33% of the total land area is protected, including 19 [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar wetland sites]].

The Senate has 70 members, of which 55 were elected and 15 were to be appointed by [[List of heads of state of Equatorial Guinea|President]] [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]].&lt;ref name=IFES&gt;[http://electionguide.org/election.php?ID=1995 Election Profile] IFES&lt;/ref&gt;

The 100 members of the [[Chamber of People's Representatives]] were elected by [[closed list]] [[proportional representation]] in multi-member constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2101_B.htm Electoral System] IPU&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hakaona''' (Hakawona, Havakona) is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] of Angola and Namibia. Until perhaps Anita Pfouts (2003), it was considered a dialect of [[Herero language|Herero]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/history/ehret/kinship/BantuClassification%204-09.pdf Bantu Classification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624221430/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/history/ehret/kinship/BantuClassification%204-09.pdf |date=2012-06-24 }}, Ehret, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maho (2009) sets up a Northwest Herero language, which includes [[Zemba language|Zimba]]; from the map, it would appear to include Himba and Hakaona as well.&lt;ref name="Guthrie"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1370">In the [[Dove Book]] and [[Russian folklore]], the '''Indrik-Beast''' (Russian: Индрик-зверь, transliteration: ''Indrik zver' '') is a fabulous beast, the king of all animals, who lives on a mountain known as "The Holy Mountain" where no other foot may tread. When it stirs, the Earth trembles. The word "Indrik" is a distorted version of the Russian word ''edinorog'' ([[unicorn]])."&lt;ref&gt;[http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=config&amp;morpho=0&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Cie%5Cvasmer&amp;first=1&amp;text_word=%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA&amp;method_word=substring&amp;text_general=&amp;method_general=substring&amp;text_origin=&amp;method_origin=substring&amp;text_trubachev=&amp;method_trubachev=substring&amp;text_editorial=&amp;method_editorial=substring&amp;text_pages=&amp;method_pages=substring&amp;text_any=&amp;method_any=substring&amp;sort=word]&lt;/ref&gt; The Indrik is described as a gigantic [[bull]] with legs of a [[deer]], the head of a [[horse]] and an enormous horn in its snout, making it vaguely similar to a [[rhinoceros]]. The Russian folklore creature gives its name to a synonym of ''[[Paraceratherium]]'', ''[[Indricotherium]]'', the biggest land mammal ever to live.

==History==

===Military use===
During late July 1941, a [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) team headed by Captain [[Elliott Roosevelt]] investigated the [[Frobisher Bay]] region for a potential airport for use in trans-Atlantic air traffic. Roosevelt's report designated a marginal site at Cape Rammelsberg for later construction. In mid-October, trawlers ''Lark'', ''Polarbjoern'', and ''Selis'' reached the vicinity, but owing to inaccurate charts (dating from the 1865 expedition of [[Charles Francis Hall]]) could not find the Roosevelt site. Instead, an eight-man crew commanded by USAAF Captain John T. Crowell was offloaded on a smaller island "about eight miles southeast of the headland Captain Roosevelt had recommended."&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, 59–65&lt;/ref&gt; They operated a weather/radio station over the winter. The expedition reported that "this island is reported to be some 400 feet high and very level on top providing a natural runway of more than a mile in length." The ships left on 5 November.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard Report&lt;/ref&gt;

When the station relief and base construction expedition arrived next July, both the Crowell and Roosevelt sites were rejected in favour of a level meadow discovered along the Sylvia Grinnell River on mainland [[Baffin Island]]. On 30 July, ships ''Polaris'' and ''[[Effie M. Morrissey]]'' anchored in what was then called Koojesse Inlet and began surveying the area: "The terrain was excellent, with level ground extending nearly the entire 6,000 feet needed for an ample runway...The harbor, readily accessible from the bay, offered a good anchorage for ships of any size that would come in."&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, 71&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition consisted further of the [[USS Bear (1874)|USCGC ''Bear'']], equipped with a seaplane, the transports ''Fairfax'' and ''Eleanor'' and some smaller vessels. Having offloaded the airport construction crews and materials, the expedition left at the end of September.

===World War II===
By summer of 1943, the airbase at Koojesse Inlet had "grown to look like a populous village" and was in use by many aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, 116&lt;/ref&gt; It was designated Crystal II and referred to as ''Chaplet'' in coded communications. It was one of three "Crystal" weather sites in the Canadian Arctic Region, [[Kuujjuaq|Fort Chimo]] (now Kuujjuaq), [[Quebec]] being "Crystal I", and a station on [[Padloping Island]] being "Crystal III". A detachment of the 8th Weather Squadron, [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] (ATC) took up residence at the station on October 1, 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/387.xml|title=USAFHRA Document 00076387|author=|date=|website=airforcehistoryindex.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230904/http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/387.xml|archivedate=24 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial mission of the Crystal sites was to provide long-range weather information to the combat forces then building up in the [[United Kingdom]].

As part of the [[Crimson Route|Crimson East]] air route network, the airfield at Crystal II was referred to by USAAF Air Transport Command as ATC Station #10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/180/777.xml|title=USAFHRA Document 00180777|author=|date=|website=airforcehistoryindex.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230910/http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/180/777.xml|archivedate=24 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to be a transport hub between the Eastern Route, which originated at [[Presque Isle Air Force Base|Presque Isle Army Airfield]], Maine and the Central Route, which originated at [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|Romulus Army Airfield]] (Detroit Airport), Michigan. The original plan, briefed by Captain Roosevelt to USAAF Chief [[Henry H. Arnold|Henry "Hap" Arnold]] and others at the [[Argentia]] summit in August 1941, called for Frobisher Bay to be a node in a northern alternate air route, running from [[Churchill, Manitoba]] via [[Southampton Island]] over Frobisher to [[Sondrestrom Air Base|Bluie West Eight]] and [[Bluie East Two]] in Greenland, rejoining the main route in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 199–200, 211–215&lt;/ref&gt; The later success of the main air route via [[Narsarsuaq Air Base|Bluie West One]] and the spring 1943 victory in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] led to cancelation of the Crimson project in late 1943, and the associated airfields were reduced to weather, communications, and logistics duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/350.xml|title=AFHRA Document 00076350|author=|date=|website=airforcehistoryindex.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811063933/http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/350.xml|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of Frobisher Bay declined with the end of World War II, with jurisdiction of the facility being transferred to [[Military Air Transport Service]] (MATS) in 1948, under its [[Air Weather Service]]. During the 1950s it continued to be used as a transit point by the  
[[United States]] and Canada. The base was closed in 1963 and converted into a civilian airport.

===Civilian use===
Since the 1950s, Frobisher Bay had earned a reputation{{by whom|date=July 2018}} as a [[wiktionary:technical stop|technical stop]] for airlines flying the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]]. Crews departing westward from [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport|Prestwick]] or [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]] in those years preferred to route via [[Iceland]] (or the [[Azores]]) to [[Gander International Airport|Gander]], thence to [[New York City]] or elsewhere. Weather, however, could dictate a northerly course, which is when Frobisher Bay came into its own. At one time,{{when|date=July 2018}} [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American]] even had a base there and on at least two occasions had to change engines on [[Douglas DC-7]]Cs at Frobisher Bay.

With the introduction of the intercontinental [[Boeing 707]] and [[Douglas DC-8]], fewer airlines stopped at Iqaluit. Even so, there always seemed to be some activity.{{according to|date=July 2018}} The place remained prominent as a regional airport, continued in its strategic role of sustaining the [[Distant Early Warning Line]] (DEW), supported the occasional military exercise or scientific expedition, and was still{{when|date=July 2018}} a key stopover on the North Atlantic ferry route.

Through the 1960s, [[Nordair]] was the main airline serving Frobisher Bay from Montreal, {{Convert|1100|NM}} to the south. [[Douglas DC-4]]s operated into the 1970s and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[Lockheed Constellation|Super Constellation]]s between 1964 and 1969. In 1968 Nordair introduced the [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200]] on the Frobisher Bay run. At the same time, Bradley Air Services had been expanding. By the 1970s, the company's fleet of [[de Havilland Canada]] [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|DHC-6 Twin Otter]]s and [[Douglas DC-3]]s was serving many small [[Arctic]] communities from YFB, carrying passengers, mail, groceries, and other essentials. Bradley became known as First Air in 1973 and soon added [[Hawker Siddeley HS 748|BAe 748]]s.

In the 1980s, Canada's airline industry was in transition, with [[Air Canada]] and [[Canadian Airlines]] rapidly buying up regional operators. Air Canada acquired Nordair in 1977, and then sold it in 1984 to Canadian Airlines. Jet service to Iqaluit Airport continued, but under the [[Canadian North]] banner, which was, after the buyout of Canadian Airlines by Air Canada, to continue operations as an independent airline, jointly owned by the [[Inuit]] of the [[Northwest Territories]] and Nunavut. Between 1985 and 1988 First Air added four [[Boeing 727]]s to link Montreal and Ottawa with Iqaluit. Meanwhile, Canadian Airlines failed, and was taken over by Air Canada in 2000. In 1995 First Air purchased the small [[Yellowknife]]-based carrier Ptarmigan Airways; then, in 1997, [[Northwest Territorial Airways]] (NWT Air), Air Canada's Yellowknife subsidiary. In the NWT Air move First Air acquired two 737-200 [[Combi aircraft|Combi]]s and a Lockheed [[Lockheed L-100 Hercules|382 Hercules]].&lt;ref&gt;''Airways'' (June 2006) ''Pages 24-28'' ''YFB and First Air''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future development==
As a result of increased traffic, the Nunavut government planned an overhaul of the airport that was expected to cost $250–300 million. The project was a [[public–private partnership]] with the GN borrowing their half of the cost. Nunavut Airport Services will operate the airport for 30 years. Upgrades included:

* new {{convert|100,000|ft2|abbr=on}} terminal building constructed by [[Bouygues]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bouygues.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bouygues_2015_registration_document1.pdf 2015 Registration Document] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604033152/http://www.bouygues.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bouygues_2015_registration_document1.pdf |date=2016-06-04 }} page 36&lt;/ref&gt;
* retrofitting the current terminal which will become solely an administration building and control tower
* expanding parking lots
* new combined services building to house all airport and safety vehicles
* a second taxiway 
* apron and repaving the runway.

The construction began in 2014 and was completed on August 8, 2017, with flight service beginning the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/story/2012/07/06/north-iqaluit-airport-rennovations.html |title=Iqaluit airport to be overhauled by 2017 |publisher=CBC |date=2012-07-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707161441/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/story/2012/07/06/north-iqaluit-airport-rennovations.html |archivedate=2012-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674new_public-private_iqaluit_airport_to_cost_up_to_300_million/ |title=New public-private Iqaluit airport to cost up to $300 million |publisher=Nunatsiaq News |date=2012-07-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216004226/http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674new_public-private_iqaluit_airport_to_cost_up_to_300_million/ |archivedate=2014-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationtalk.ca/story/new-iqaluit-international-airport-terminal-opening/ |title=New Iqaluit International Airport terminal opening |publisher=NationTalk |date=2017-08-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029065843/http://nationtalk.ca/story/new-iqaluit-international-airport-terminal-opening |archivedate=2017-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, 2015, during construction, a large fire caused major damage to the roof of the new terminal, costing an estimated $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/iqaluit-airport-fire-damage-1.3222831 |title=Iqaluit airport terminal fire damage estimated at $1M |publisher=CBC |date=2015-09-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811101405/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/iqaluit-airport-fire-damage-1.3222831 |archivedate=2016-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landing was executed safely - the first [[Boeing 747]] ever to attempt to land at Iqaluit - but one of the 747's engines hit a fuel pump on the tarmac as it was taxiing, causing serious damage to the aircraft and a potentially dangerous fuel spill. The 397 stranded passengers, including singer [[Gary Barlow]], were flown out after Virgin Atlantic chartered two jets. The passengers, after spending 16 hours in a local [[curling]] rink, were taken to New York to catch connecting flights to Los Angeles. [[Prince Michael of Kent]], who had also been on the flight, was given a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] escort and departed on an earlier scheduled flight. The original aircraft had its engines repaired and left four days after the accident.

[[File:Airbus A380 in Iqaluit 02.jpg|thumb|Airbus A380 at Iqaluit]]
The [[Airbus A380]], the world's largest passenger jet, conducted cold weather testing from Iqaluit Airport during February 2006 - its first North American visit. They were hoping to experience {{convert|-25|C|0}} weather to determine the effects on cabin temperatures and engine performance. Nunavut authorities hope that the importance of these tests will put Iqaluit on the map as a centre for cold-weather testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/02/10/airbus060310.html |title=Jumbo Airbus getting cold, and more, during Iqaluit tests |publisher=CBC |date=2006-02-10 |accessdate =2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, [[Airbus Military]] used the airport to test the [[Airbus A400M Atlas]] military transport aircraft that is currently being developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airbusmilitary.com/LatestNews/tabid/176/ArticleID/250/ArtMID/681/Airbus-Military-A400M-undergoes-latest-cold-weather-tests.aspx Airbus Military A400M undergoes latest cold weather tests] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321215847/http://www.airbusmilitary.com/LatestNews/tabid/176/ArticleID/250/ArtMID/681/Airbus-Military-A400M-undergoes-latest-cold-weather-tests.aspx |date=2013-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city government sent a delegation to [[Paris Airshow]] in June 2013 to promote Iqaluit as an ideal location for these tests. [[Airbus A350]] followed suit and conducted its cold weather testing in January 2014. Airport staff cited low landing fee, sufficient runway length, and minimal air traffic movement all helped in the decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/airbus-s-new-a350-in-iqaluit-for-cold-weather-testing-1.2512504 |title=Airbus's new A350 in Iqaluit for cold weather testing |date=2014-01-27 |publisher=CBC News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131194653/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/airbus-s-new-a350-in-iqaluit-for-cold-weather-testing-1.2512504 |archivedate=2014-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following from these previous successful visits by prototype Airbus aircraft, the company sent the first [[A320neo]] with [[CFM International LEAP]] engines to be tested in January 2016.

In January 2012 [[Air Greenland]] announced that a 1-hour, 45-minute flight from [[Nuuk]] to Iqaluit, down from three days when going via Copenhagen or Reykjavik and then on to Ottawa, would begin 18 June 2012, later changed to 15 June. The service was a partnership with [[First Air]] who provided ticketing and other services in Iqaluit. This was the first international flight into Iqaluit since 2001 when First Air discontinued its Iqaluit to [[Kangerlussuaq]] flights.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 12 February 1973, [[Douglas C-47|Douglas C-47A]] C-FOOV of [[Kenting Atlas Aviation]] crashed on approach. The aircraft was on a ferry flight to [[Resolute Bay Airport]] when power was lost shortly after take-off from Iqaluit and the decision was made to return. All three people on board survived.&lt;ref name=ASN120273&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19730212-0 |title=CF-OOV Accident description |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=26 August 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20100826181146/http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19730212-0 |archivedate=26 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 14 August 1996, a [[Canadian Forces]] [[CF-18 Hornet]] left the runway during [[takeoff]], slid down an embankment and ruptured a fuel pipeline. The aircraft caught fire, as did fuel spilling from the pipeline, however the pilot had ejected just as the plane left the runway and suffered a broken ankle. The pipeline was shut down and the fire brought under control in less than an hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nunatsiaq.com/archives/back-issues/week/60816.html#1 Pilot ejects in nick of time as CF-18 crashes while attempting to take off.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107084849/http://www.nunatsiaq.com/archives/back-issues/week/60816.html |date=2007-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2035">The '''National Health Accounts''' is a process through which countries monitor the flow of money in their health sector. Looking at different perspective of health financing.
The [[World Health Organization]] has been coordinating efforts at the global level to produce those estimates for each and every country.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Statistics 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=August 2017}}
On the 1948 the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) constitution was the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) firmly based. For the monitoring of the UHC it is essential to measure how health systems are financed. The measurement of the health systems are based on data generated by the National Health Accounts. National Health Accounts have been developed using the System of Health Accounts (SHA) defined by [[OECD]]. The SHA has been developed since 2000. National Health Accounts have been produced in most developing countries between 2002 and 2009.
A new version of SHA has been released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;A system of health accounts, 10 Oct 2011, 522 pages http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/a-system-of-health-accounts_9789264116016-en&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic Structure==
Every expenditure in the health system is classified according to characteristics.
The three major categories are : Health Care Functions, Health Care Providers, Health Care Financing Schemes.
Within each category, you find a number of subcategories.

'''Example of subcategories in Health Care Financing Schemes'''

=== Public expenses ===
*[[Tax]] 
*Mandatory [[Health Insurance]] - Social  
*Security- [[Hypothecated tax|Earmarked taxes]]
*Public Donor funding

=== Private expenses ===
*Direct Household Expenses (OOP)
*[[Non Governmental Organisation]]
*[[Private insurance]] - [[Community Insurance]]
*Health expenses by companies

'''[[Andorra]]''', officially the ''Principality of Andorra'', is a small country located in the [[Pyrenees]] mountains and bordered by Spain and France. The official language is [[Catalan language|Catalan]], although Spanish, French, and Portuguese are also commonly spoken.

Postal services in Andorra are unique in that they are not operated by the country itself, but by its two larger neighbouring countries, [[Spain]] and [[France]].&lt;ref name="upu"&gt;[http://www.upu.int/fileadmin/documentsFiles/activities/addressingUnit/andEn.pdf Andorra], [[Universal Postal Union]], September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Correos]]'' of Spain and ''[[La Poste (France)|La Poste]]'' of France operate side by side. 

Both postal administrations issue their own postage stamps for use in Andorra featuring unique designs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/07/18/14/andorra-honors-pinoys-stamp Andorra honors Pinoys with a stamp], Daniel Infante Tuaño, [[ABS-CBN]], July 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; as those of Spain and France are not valid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WttmSt7kPmMC&amp;pg=PA412&amp;lpg=PA412&amp;dq=postal+services+in+andorra+stamps&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YCYZs8vrA2&amp;sig=RP8qMW_RjpZX002om9FLfNZQ6Uo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBWoVChMI25Lk7_7MxgIVJ89yCh1yogqo#v=onepage&amp;q=postal%20services%20in%20andorra%20stamps&amp;f=true ''Spain''], Damien Simonis, Lonely Planet, 2007, page 412&lt;/ref&gt;

== French stamps ==
The 1931 issues were those of France overprinted "ANDORRE".

Its first set of stamps was produced in 1932 inscribed "Vallees d'Andorre", which depicted churches such as Our Lady's Chapel, [[Meritxell]] and St. Michael's Church, [[Engolasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stamps of the World|publisher=[[Stanley Gibbons]]|year=2004|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spanish stamps ==

In 1928 Spanish stamps were overprinted "CORREOS ANDORRA" for use in Andorra. 

The first set of definitives was issued in 1929.

'''Rastislalić''' (Растислалић) was a Serbian noble family that held lands in the [[Braničevo (region)|Braničevo region]] of [[Serbia]] in the 14th century, initially under the Serbian crown and later under the Hungarian. They held Braničevo and Kučevo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=twYuAAAAYAAJ p. 169]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the rule of [[Stefan Uroš IV Dušan|Stefan Uroš IV Dušan 'the Mighty']] (r. 1331-1355), [[Branko Rastislalić|Branko]] (d. 1352) gained control of the Braničevo region, he was accidentally killed during a hunt by ''voivode'' [[Vuk Kosača]], his relatives later [[Krvna Osveta|avenged his death]] in 1359, when they murdered Vuk.&lt;ref&gt;Arheološko društvo Jugoslavije, 1968, ''Arheološki pregled'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ym8rAAAAIAAJ Volumes 10-11], page 96&lt;/ref&gt; The feud continued between the two families, [[Stephen Uroš V of Serbia|Stefan Uroš V 'the Weak']] was at war with Tsar Symeon, the Rastislalići turned to the other side of the Danube, where Hungarian-ruled territory in [[Mačva]] was held by Ban [[Nicholas I Garay]]. A Hungarian band was sent to take care of the enemies in Braničevo, and they became vassals of the Kingdom of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;''The Serbs'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=sJJWEnXTHdIC&amp;pg=PA80 p. 80]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1359, perhaps at their invitation, [[Louis I of Hungary]] marched into Serbia and defeated Uroš V.&lt;ref&gt;''The realm of St. Stephen: a history of medieval Hungary, 895-1526'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vEJNBqanT_8C&amp;pg=PA164 p. 164]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radič Branković]] was the last feudal lord; he was evicted in 1379 by [[Knez (title)|Knez]] [[Lazar of Serbia|Lazar]] who issued a military action against him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srpska-mreza.com/bookstore/kosovo/kosovo10.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__

The '''Diocese of Luni''' was a [[Roman Catholic]] bishopric with its seat in [[Luni, Italy|Luni]], [[Liguria]], northwestern Italy. The bishop and cathedral chapter moved to [[Sarzana]] in the 12th century; the move was formalised in 1201.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, p. 100-106 no. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Though the bishops of Luni had been resident at Sarzana long before the official transfer of the cathedral, the diocese and bishop continued to use the name of Luni in their titles down to 1465, when the name of Sarzana was added to both.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The name of the former diocese was revived in 1976 to designate a [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;David M. Cheney, ''Catholic-Hierarchy.org'', [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d2l84.html "Luni: (Titular See)"]; retrieved: 2018-01-07.{{self-published source|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--commented out pending rewrite
== History ==
{{expand section|small=no|date=July 2018}}
On 30 June 1183, the Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] granted Bishop Pietro the county of Luni, the shoreline, and the port of Amelia ([[Ameglia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, pp. 350-351 no. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop Walterius (1193–1212) and the magistrates of Sarzana engaged in extensive consultations to make explicit all of their mutual rights and obligations as the Bishop moved his official seat to Sarzana, where in fact the bishops had been living for some time. The pact was signed on 24 June 1201.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, p. 100-106 no. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop Walterius and the Canons of the Cathedral also negotiated a pact, which was approved by [[Pope Innocent III]] on 7 March 1202 in the bull ''In eminenti sedis''.&lt;ref&gt;Ughelli, I, p. 850. {{cite book|author=Giovanni Battista Pittoni|title=Constitutiones pontificiae et Romanarum congregationum decisiones ad canonicos utriusque ecclesiae cathedralis scilicet &amp; collegiatae spectantes.

Though the bishops of Luni had been resident at Sarzana long before the official transfer of the Cathedral, the diocese continued to be called the Diocese of Luni and the bishop continued to be called the Bishop of Luni down to 1465, when the name of Sarzana was added both to the diocesan name and the episcopal title.{{cite}}

The '''Roman Catholic Diocese of Sandomierz''' ({{lang-la|Sandomirien(sis)}}) is an [[diocese]] located in the city of [[Sandomierz]] in the [[Ecclesiastical province]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lublin|Lublin]] in [[Poland]].

==History==
The Diocese of Sandomierz was created on 30 June 1818 by [[Pope Pius VII]] in accordance with the Bull ''Ex imposita nobis''.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web | title=History of the Diocese | url=http://sdmsandomierz.pl/en/history-of-the-diocese/ | publisher=Diocese of Sandomierz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, its name was changed to the Diocese of Sandomierz-Radom&lt;ref name=history/&gt; but on 25 March 1992 the [[diocese of Radom]] was split off as part of a reorganization of the church in Poland by [[Pope John Paul II]] which added to Sandomierz 7 deaneries from Przemysl, two from Lublin and one from Tarnow.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1963">The term '''Scoto-Norman''' (also '''Scoto-Normans''', '''Scotto-Norman''', '''Franco-Scottish''' or '''Franco-Gaelic''') is used to describe people, families, institutions and archaeological artifacts that are partly [[Scottish people|Scottish]] (in some sense) and partly [[Normans|Norman]] or [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] (in some sense). It is used to refer to people or things of Norman,  Anglo-Norman, [[France|French]] or even [[Flemings|Flemish]] or [[Breton people|Breton]] origin, but who are associated with [[Scotland in the Middle Ages]]. It is also used for any of these things where they exhibit [[syncretism]] between [[French culture|French]] or Anglo-French culture on the one hand,  and [[Gaelic culture]] on the other. 

For instance, the [[Kings of Scots|Kings of Scotland]] between the reign of the [[David I of Scotland|David I]] and the [[House of Stewart|Stewart]] period are often described as Scoto-Norman. A classic case of Gaelic and French cultural syncretism would be [[Lochlann, Lord of Galloway|Lochlann]], [[Lords of Galloway|Lord of Galloway]], who used both a Gaelic (''Lochlann'') and French name (''Roland''), and kept followers of both languages. Another example of a Scoto-Norman, would be [[Robert the Bruce]], who had a dual Norman-Gaelic heritage.

The term is used by historians as an alternative to Anglo-Norman when that term pertains to Scotland. It was first used in 1829, in P. F. Tytler's ''History of Scotland''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pZNQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA359&amp;lpg=PA359&amp;dq=scoto-normans&amp;source=bl P. F. Tytler History of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50216409 Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition (1989)-]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scott's Hut''' is a building located on the north shore of [[Cape Evans]] on [[Ross Island]] in [[Antarctica]]. It was erected in 1911 by the [[Terra Nova Expedition|British Antarctic Expedition of 1910–1913]] (also known as the [[Terra Nova (ship)|Terra Nova]] Expedition) led by [[Robert Falcon Scott]]. In selecting a base of operations for the 1910–1913 Expedition, Scott rejected the notion of reoccupying the [[Discovery Hut|hut]] he had built by [[McMurdo Sound]] during the [[Discovery Expedition]] of 1901–1904. 

This first hut was located at [[Hut Point Peninsula|Hut Point]], 20&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Cape Evans]]. Two factors influenced this decision. One was that the hut was extremely cold for living quarters and the other was that Scott's ship, the ''[[RRS Discovery|Discovery]]'', had been trapped by sea ice at Hut Point, a problem he hoped to avoid by establishing his new base farther north.

Some confusion arises because [[Discovery Hut]] can technically be referred to as ''Scott's'' hut, in that his expedition built it, and it was his base ashore during the 1901–1904 expedition, but the title ''Scott's Hut'' popularly belongs to the building erected in 1911 at Cape Evans.

== Description ==
[[File:Cape Evans - Inside Scott's Hut.jpg|thumb|300px|Interior showing beds]]
Scott's Hut was prefabricated in England before being brought south by ship. It is rectangular, {{convert|50|ft}}  long and {{convert|25|ft}} wide. Insulation was provided by seaweed sewn into a quilt, placed between double-planked inner and outer walls. The roof was a sandwich of three layers of plank and two layers of rubber ply enclosing more quilted seaweed. Lighting was provided by acetylene gas, and heating came from the kitchen and a supplementary stove using coal as fuel. 

[[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] wrote that the hut was divided into separate areas for sleeping and working by a bulkhead made of boxes of stores. A stable building (for nineteen Siberian ponies), approximately {{convert|50|by|16|ft}}, was subsequently attached to the north wall of the main building. A utility room, approximately {{convert|40|by|12|ft}}, was also added later, built around the original small porch at the South West end of the main building. 

Considerable effort was made to insulate the building, and to extract the maximum amount of heat from the flues from the stove and the heater, based on lessons learned from the [[Discovery Hut]]. Terra Nova expeditioners described the hut as being warm to the point of being uncomfortable.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

A cross is erected on a hill behind Scott's Hut at Cape Evans, but this is not connected to Captain Scott, having been erected in memory of the three members of Shackleton's [[Ross Sea Party]], who died nearby. The cross erected in memory of Captain Scott and his polar companions is to be found atop [[Observation Hill (McMurdo Station)|Observation Hill]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Use of Scott's Hut ==
During the winter of 1911, 25 men of the Terra Nova shore party lived in the hut. From here Scott and his men set out on the ultimately fatal trek to the [[South Pole]]. Following the failure of Scott's southern party to return several men remained behind for a further winter (1912) in order to search for the bodies the next spring. In 1913, the Terra Nova expedition over, it was left well supplied with stores in the way of food and oil, and a certain amount of coal.

The hut was reused from 1915-1917 by several of Shackleton's [[Ross Sea party]] after the [[SY Aurora|''Aurora'']], which was to have been the permanent winter quarters, broke adrift in May 1915, and went north with the ice, unable to return. The hut became the permanent living quarters for the ten marooned men, and thanks to the stores they were able to sustain life in comparative comfort, supplementing these stores from Shackleton's Hut at [[Cape Royds]]. In January 1917, after Shackleton had rescued the survivors, he had the hut put in order and locked up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/5199/5199-h/5199-h.htm#24 |title=South: The Story of Shackleton's Last Expedition 1914-1917 |author=Ernest Shackelton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although abandoned from 1917, the hut and its contents are remarkably well preserved today due to the consistently sub-freezing conditions.

== Preservation and decay at Scott's Hut ==
[[File:HSM-16 Terra Nova Hut.JPG|thumbnail|300px|Scientific instruments located inside the hut, as they appeared in 2013.]]
After 1917, the hut remained untouched until 1956, when [[Operation Deep Freeze|US expeditioners]] dug it out of the snow and ice. It was found to be in a remarkable state of preservation, and included many artifacts from both the earlier expeditions. While some artifacts were taken as souvenirs at the time (and since), this hut has remained largely as it was in 1917.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

New Zealand and the UK have undertaken responsibility at various times since the 1970s to restore (largely by removing snow and ice) both Scott's hut and Discovery Hut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/earth/antarctica/about/index.html |title=About the Antarctic Heritage Trust &amp;#124; Natural History Museum |publisher=Nhm.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage-antarctica.org/index.cfm/default/ |title=Antarctic Explorers &amp; Heritage Preservation &amp;#124; Antarctic Heritage Trust |publisher=Heritage-antarctica.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the preservation of food in the freezing temperatures and dry climate has been noted, bacterial decay still occurs. Visitors describe the [[seal meat]] preserved at the Discovery Hut as smelling 'quite rancid', and some{{who|date=December 2013}} have expressed concerns that the fabric of these huts are being affected by fungal decay.&lt;ref name="blanchette"&gt;Blanchette, Robert (2004). Research at the Historic Expedition Huts of Antarctica. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://forestpathology.coafes.umn.edu/addantarctica.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624121800/http://forestpathology.coafes.umn.edu/addantarctica.htm |archivedate=24 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historic site ==
Both Scott's Hut and [[Cape_Royds#Shackleton.27s_Hut|Shackleton's Hut]] have been included on the [[World Monuments Watch]]. Shackleton's was included in 2004 and 2006, and Scott's in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wmf.org/project/scotts-hut-and-explorers-heritage-antarctica |title=Scott's Hut and the Explorers' Heritage of Antarctica &amp;#124; World Monuments Fund |publisher=World Monuments Fund |date= |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hut has been designated an [[Historic Sites and Monuments in Antarctica|Antarctic Historic Site or Monument]] (HSM 16), following a proposal by New Zealand and the United Kingdom to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting]].&lt;ref name=ats&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ats.aq/documents/ATCM35/WW/atcm35_ww003_e.pdf |title=List of Historic Sites and Monuments approved by the ATCM (2012) |accessdate=2013-10-27 |work= |first= |last= |publisher=Antarctic Treaty Secretariat |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gadajacy Pies.JPG|250px|right|thumb|14th edition of "Gadający Pies". Aleksander Janicki on the stage, on the left masters of the ceremony, Prus and Bikont.]]
The '''''Talking Dog''''' ({{lang-pl|Gadający Pies}}) was a cultural event held monthly at the Piękny Pies (''Beautiful Dog'') club in [[Kraków]] from the second half of 2010 until March 2015, described as "an anthropological talking magazine". It was led by [[Piotr Bikont]] and [[Maciej Piotr Prus]]. Editorial staff of the magazine included both masters of the ceremony (Prus and Bikont), and also [[Aleksander Janicki (actor)|Aleksander Janicki]] (&lt;small&gt;[[:pl:Aleksander Janicki (artysta)|pl]]&lt;/small&gt;), [[Edward Pasewicz]], Andrzej Pilichowski Ragno, [[Jorgos Skolias]] and [[Marcin Świetlicki]]. Since the premiere, ''Gadający Pies'' had 31 editions.

== History ==
The first edition of ''Gadający Pies'' took place in the second half of 2010. In November 2011 a special episode titled ''Gadająca Suka'' (''The Talking Bitch'') was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.miastokobiet.pl/gadajacy-pies-gadajaca-suka/| title = Gadająca Suka| accessdate= 2013-01-23| author = | publisher= miastokobiet.pl| work= | date = | language = Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine suspended its activity from April until December 2012. It was reactivated in January 2013.

Each edition of ''Gadający Pies'' contained performances by musicians, poets, writers and scientists. Each performer had only five minutes to do the show. Prus, who was the master of the ceremony, kept five red lamps and has been consistently turning each lamp off after one minute of the performance.

Among people who regularly appeared on the stage within ''Gadający Pies'' were [[Marcin Baran]], [[Miłosz Biedrzycki]], [[Wojciech Bonowicz]], [[Paweł Głowacki]], [[Maciej Miezian]] and [[Jerzy Vetulani]].&lt;ref name=wyb&gt;{{cite web| url = http://krakow.gazeta.pl/krakow/1,44425,11025265,Kulturalne_Odloty__Pies_pieknie_e%20klektyczny.html| title = Kulturalne Odloty: Pies pięknie eklektyczny| accessdate= 2012-02-25| author = Małgorzata I.

In November 2013, the first edition of an international version of ''The Talking Dog'' magazine was held. Created by David McGirr, led by McGirr and Kevin Patrick Cullen, it was an event separated from the original ''Gadający Pies''. As it was led in English, its purpose was to integrate different Kraków communities and people living in Kraków that didn't speak Polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.krakowpost.com/article/7312| title = Talking Dog International – A New Breed of Entertainment| accessdate= 2013-11-22| author = | publisher= krakowpost.com| work= | date = 2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/14/krakow-unesco-city-of-literatre?CMP=twt_gu| title = Krakow's story: a Unesco City of Literature built out of books| accessdate= 2013-11-18| author = Antonia Lloyd-Jones| publisher = theguardian.com| work = | date = 2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, Hungarian news portals reported that ''The Budapest Beacon'' planned to launch a Hungarian-language news website that September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Új online újságot alapítanak az egykori origósok|url=http://index.hu/kultur/media/2014/07/15/uj_online_ujsagot_kaptak_az_egykori_origosok/|website=Index.hu|publisher=Index.hu|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Új lap indul ősszel – volt origósokkal|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20140715_Uj_lap_indul_osszel__volt_Origosokkal|website=HVG|publisher=HVG.hu|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Új lapot indítanak az "Origo-árvák"|url=http://nol.hu/belfold/uj-lapot-inditanak-az-origo-arvak-1474303|website=nol.hu|publisher=Népszabadság|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Volt origósokkal indul új netes lap|url=http://nepszava.hu/cikk/1027199-kirugott-origosokkal-indul-uj-netes-lap|website=nepszava.hu|publisher=Népszava Online|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Új portált indítanak a távozó origósok|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20140715-uj-portalt-indit-az-origo-tavozo-felelos-szerkesztoje.html|website=Origo.hu|publisher=Origo Zrt.|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Az LMP egykori mecénása egy rakás Origo-árvával csinál online lapot|url=http://cink.hu/az-lmp-egykori-mecenasa-egy-rakas-origo-arvaval-csinal-1605171465|website=Cink.hu|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nasser Chrustschow Arif Sallal 1964 Nil.jpg|thumb|From left to right: [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]], [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]], [[Abdul Salam Arif|Arif]] and [[Abdullah al-Sallal|as-Sallal]] in Egypt (May 1964)]]
A '''Unified Political Command'''  (Arabic  قيادة سياسية موحدة, ''qiyāda siyāsiyya muwaḥḥada''), also translated as ''Joint Political Command'' or ''Unified Political Leadership'', was agreed in 1964 between the presidents of Egypt and Iraq ([[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and [[Abdul Salam Arif]]) as well as between the presidents of Egypt and North Yemen (Nasser and [[Abdullah al-Sallal|Abdullah as-Sallal]]). Both projects were parallel but not linked with each other. The ''Unified Political Command'' was meant as a kind of [[Provisional government|transitional government]] which should prepare the gradual merger of Iraq with Egypt and North Yemen with Egypt in a new [[United Arab Republic (disambiguation)|United Arab Republic]].

==Egypt and Iraq==
[[File:Nasser and Iraqi Prime Minister al-Bazzaz.jpg|thumb|[[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] with the Iraqi Prime Minister [[Abd al-Rahman al-Bazzaz|al-Bazzaz]] (left): Still in February 1966 the Egyptian-Iraqi ''Unified Political Command'' declared its satisfaction about the merger progress in both republics]]
Therefore, on 26 May 1964 Nasser and Arif agreed to form a joint Presidential Council and a Unified Political Command on 16 October 1964. This Unified Command was established on 20 December 1964 and did include the prime ministers of Egypt and Iraq as well as the ministers of economical and financial affairs and social planning of both sides and should act as a joint supreme instrument and highest executive authority to establish the economical, political and military unification of Egypt and Iraq within two years. The Iraqi Abd ar-Razzaq Muhyi ad-Din (Abdel Razzaq Mohieddin) became General Secretary of the Unified Command. In July 1964 an [[Arab Socialist Union (Iraq)|Iraqi Arab Socialist Union]] was founded as political instrument to collect the support of the population and was formally united with the [[Arab Socialist Union (Egypt)|Egyptian Arab Socialist Union]] in September 1964. Also in September 1964 Egypt and Iraq agreed to unite their diplomatical corps and representations all over the world. In 1965 Iraq adopted the [[Coat of arms of Egypt|Egyptian coat of arms eagle]] and the Egyptian national anthem, declared Iraq as a ''democratic and socialist republic'' and announced a programme of nationalization. However, despite a few real meetings and sessions of this ''Unified Political Command'' the project stopped when the Nasserist prime minister of Iraq, [[Arif Abd ar-Razzaq]], tried to overthrow president Arif in September 1965 and when Arif died in April 1966.

==Egypt and Yemen==
[[File:A meeting between Yemen represented by President Abdullah AL Sallal and Egypt headed by Abdel Nasser 14 July 1964.jpg|thumb|In July 1964 Nasser and Sallal agreed about the gradual merger of Egypt and Yemen towards a full union]]
Parallelly, but not linked with the Egyptian-Iraqi merger project also between Nasser and as-Sallal a ''Unified Political Command'' was established on 13 July 1964. A joint government council of the Egyptian and Yemeni ministers should coordinate and integrate the Foreign, Defense, Economical, Social, Cultural and Information policy towards full unity. A (short-living) Yemeni ''Arab Socialist Union'' (later renamed) was established already in 1964 and, in fact, Egyptian generals and officers took over the command of the republican forces in Yemen during the [[North Yemen Civil War]]. This civil war, however, prevented any progress and when Egypt withdraw its troops from Yemen after the [[Six-Day War]] as-Sallal was overthrown in November 1967 and also this project definitively ended.

==Others==
Similar ''Unified Political Commands'' and ''Joint Supreme Committees'' were planned and formed 
*between the Syrian president [[Hafez al-Assad]] and king [[Hussein of Jordan]] in Juli 1975 in order to coordinate and push the military, political and economical integration of Syria and Jordan. The project failed when Syria re-approached Egypt within the [[Federation of Arab Republics]] in December 1976
*within the Egyptian-Libyan-Syrian [[Federation of Arab Republics]] between Egypt, Libya and Sudan in April 1970. Later Syria joined instead of Sudan, but Egypt and Libya agreed to let a ''Unified Political Command'' prepare a more substantial union within the federation. The Egyptian-Libyan merger failed 1973 but on 21 December 1976 and in February 1977 the Syrian president Assad and the Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] agreed to form a new bilateral ''Unified Political Command'' and a ''Political Supreme Council''. In March 1977 Sudans president [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] joined that ''Unified Political Command'' and all three presidents announced to form a new ''Federation of Arab Republics'' which never was realized and finally collapsed in November 1977 with the begin of Egyptian-Israeli peace talks.
*between Syria and Iraq in October 1978 when both sides agreed to improve their military and economical cooperation and even planned to form a Syrian-Iraqi Union. A ''Supreme Political Authority'' (Committee) and later also a ''Joint Political Command'' was formed with Iraqi president [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]], Syrian president Assad and Iraqi vice president [[Saddam Hussein]]. The project failed when Saddam Hussein replaced al-Bakr in July 1979.

It existed from October 20, 1975 when the Lesotho campus of the [[University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland]] (UBLS) withdrew to form the [[National University of Lesotho]] (NUL), until June 1982 when the two universities in Botswana and Swaziland were established. The campuses of this university were in [[Kwaluseni]] and [[Luyengo]] in Swaziland and [[Gaborone]] in Botswana.

'''Wardija Battery''' ({{lang-mt|Batterija tal-Wardija}}) was an [[artillery battery]] in [[Wardija]], a [[Wardija Ridge|hilltop]] in the limits of [[St. Paul's Bay]], on the northern coast of [[Malta]]. It was built by the [[British Empire|British]] in 1915, and saw use during [[World War I]]. It became obsolete following the construction of [[Fort Campbell (Malta)|Fort Campbell]] in 1938.

==History==
In October 1914, the British authorities made St. Paul's Bay an examination anchorage, and decided to build a battery to identify shipping on the way to the [[Grand Harbour]], and fire [[warning shot]]s to ships who were not obeying the regulations. In May 1915, two submarines were sighted off Malta outside the range of coastal artillery, hastening the need to build a battery in the north of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Debono|first1=Charles|title=Major land, sea, air offensives during the first half of 1915|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150426/life-features/major-land-sea-air-offensives-during-the-first-half-of-1915.565835 |work=[[Times of Malta]] |date=26 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612140838/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150426/life-features/major-land-sea-air-offensives-during-the-first-half-of-1915.565835 |archivedate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wardija Battery 11.jpg|thumb|left|One of the gun emplacements]]
Between 30 November and 10 December 1915, the [[Royal Malta Artillery]] removed two [[QF 6 inch /40 naval gun|6-inch QF guns]] from the obsolete [[Wolseley Battery]] in the south of Malta, and mounted them in a position on the eastern end of the [[Wardija Ridge]]. The site was naturally protected so no permanent [[fortification]]s were built, and the battery only consisted of two gun emplacements.&lt;ref name=geocaching&gt;{{cite web|title=Wardija Battery|url=https://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC56FWH&amp;title=wardija-battery&amp;guid=f81e8811-0b78-4289-bc58-f38802e28cd3|website=Geocaching|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114203926/https://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC56FWH&amp;title=wardija-battery&amp;guid=f81e8811-0b78-4289-bc58-f38802e28cd3|archivedate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two guns were designated ''Wardija Battery'' on 31 December 1915, and fell under the command of the Western Section [[Royal Garrison Artillery]].
