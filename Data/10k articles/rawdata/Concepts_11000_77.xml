      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8901">'''[https://www.accountablenow.org Accountable Now]''' is a global platform, founded in 2008 by a group of independent non-profit organisations, which is intended to foster [[accountability]] and [[Transparency (behaviour)#Non-governmental organizations|transparency]] of [[Non-governmental organization|civil society organisations]] (CSOs), as well as stakeholder  communication and performance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://s3.amazonaws.com/webprofile-ngos/Files/22/INGO-Accountability-Charter_en.pdf INGO Accountability Charter] &lt;/ref&gt; It supports CSOs to be transparent, responsive to stakeholders and focused on delivering impact. 

Accountable Now was founded under the name International NGO Charter of Accountability by eleven leading CSOs, including development, humanitarian, environmental, rights-based and advocacy organisations. As Membership and global collaboration increase, CSOs collective voices are strengthened. Today, 29 Member Organisations are active in more than 150 countries and impact stakeholders all over the world.

== Background ==
CSOs are more important than ever before in framing and influencing social, political and economic environments. On the national level they provide disaster relief and social service, promote self-help and self- governance in developing countries where they are operating. In addition they enhance a strong international [[Civil society|Civil Society]] by creating informal but important normative regimes which are influencing international institutions in their decision-making. This greater involvement of CSOs also raises the question of how they justify their activities.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L. David and Mark H. Moore (2001): “Accountability, Strategy, and International Nongovernmental Organizations”, in: “Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly” 30: p.569, online: [http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/30/3/569]&lt;/ref&gt;

CSOs have a particular interest in meeting standards on accountability and transparency in view of the responsibilities towards not only the cause which they are meant to serve, but also stakeholders of various types, including donors and sponsors (possibly comprising corporations and governments), intended program beneficiaries, staff and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Maria Francesch-Huidobro: ''Governance, politics and the environment: a Singapore study'', Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS), {{ISBN|978-981-230-831-3}}, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QrCqBmdZY5UC&amp;pg=PA60 p. 60]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: Kumi Naidoo: ''Global civic society: Rallying for real change''.

Accountable Now is considered a contributing element to underscoring the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of CSOs.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Matthews: ''Intellectual Property, Human Rights and Development: The Role of NGOs and Social Movements'', MPG Books Group, UK, {{ISBN|978-1-84720-785-2}}, 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CxgHNQz5Oq8C&amp;pg=PA229 p. 229]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

===Development===
At the International Advocacy Non-Government Organisations (IANGO) Workshop hosted by Transparency International in June 2003, the importance of promoting accountability and legitimacy was discussed by its participants. As they recognised their growing involvement in international issues the need of promoting accountability was highlighted. The Hauser Center for Non-Profit Organisations at the Harvard University was asked for a research paper on the topic to provide a foundation for following discussions.
At the following annual meetings in 2004 and 2005 the participants analysed their own concepts of accountability, set up an initial draft and with the help of independent consultant specialists revised the draft until a final version was ready to launch.&lt;ref&gt;Explore Charter background on: {{cite web|url=http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-the-charter/background-of-the-charter/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513170305/http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-the-charter/background-of-the-charter/ |archivedate=2013-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adoption ===
[https://s3.amazonaws.com/webprofile-ngos/Files/22/INGO-Accountability-Charter_en.pdf The INGO Accountability Charter], signed in June 2006 by eleven leading [[international NGO]]s active in the area of [[human rights]], environment and social development, set the course for the establishment of Accountable Now (then known as the INGO Accountability Charter) and it has been referred to as “the first ever set of international and cross-sector guidelines for the NGO sector”&lt;ref name="brainard-p175"&gt;Lael Brainard, Derek Chollet (editors): ''Global development 2.0: can philanthropists, the public, and the poor make poverty history?'', The Brookings Institution, {{ISBN|978-0-8157-1393-7}}, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tgDGgLaDw8IC&amp;pg=PA175 p. 175]&lt;/ref&gt; and the “first global accountability charter for the non-profit sector”.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Stuart Thompson: ''Laying the groundwork: Considerations for a charter for a proposed global civic society forum''.

=== Founding Signatories ===
The founding signatories were [[ActionAid|ActionAid International]], [[Amnesty International]], [[CIVICUS]] World Alliance for Citizen Participation, [[Consumers International]], [[Greenpeace International]], [[Oxfam International]], [[International Save the Children Alliance]], [[Survival International]], [[Terre des hommes|International Federation Terre des Hommes]], [[Transparency International]] and [[World YWCA]].

== Articles ==
The charter is ''based on ten core principles and aimed at enhancing respect for human rights, good governance, accountability and transparency, encouraging stakeholder communication, promoting inclusion and environmental responsibility, and improving organisational performance and effectiveness''.&lt;ref name="brainard-p175"/&gt; It documents the commitment of [[international NGO]]s to these aims. 

== Organisation ==
In 2008, the signatory-NGOs decided to found an independent organisation of the same name ''International NGO Accountability Charter Ltd'' in order to organise the reporting and vetting process of the member organisations against the charter commitments and develop them further. Today, the organisation operates under the name [https://www.accountablenow.org Accountable Now] and has 29 member organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-accountable-now/|title=Who we are|newspaper=Accountable Now|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Related codes of conduct ==
In 1997, the [[One World Trust]] had created an ''NGO Charter'', a [[code of conduct]] comprising commitment to accountability and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oneworldtrust.org/csoproject/cso/initiatives/358/charte_des_ong_ngo_charter Charte des ONG (NGO Charter)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928052118/http://www.oneworldtrust.org/csoproject/cso/initiatives/358/charte_des_ong_ngo_charter |date=2011-09-28 }}, One World Trust, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ajātivāda''''' is the fundamental philosophical doctrine of the [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosopher [[Gaudapada]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} According to Gaudapada, the [[Brahman|Absolute]] is not subject to [[Saṃsāra|birth, change and death]]. The Absolute is ''aja'', the unborn eternal.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} The [[Empiricism|empirical world]] of [[phenomenon|appearances]] is considered [[Maya (illusion)|unreal]], and not [[Philosophical realism|absolutely existent]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}}

Gaudapada's perspective is based on the ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]'',{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} applying the philosophical concept of "ajāta" to the inquiry of Brahman,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} showing that Brahman wholly transcends the conventional understanding of being and becoming. The concept is also found in Madhyamaka Buddhism, as the theory of nonorigination.{{sfn|King|1995|p=138}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H. Potter |title=Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Volume 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCWU_ua5kxgC |year=1981|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn= 978-81-208-0310-7|pages=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Ajātivāda:
* "A" means "not", or "non" as in Ahimsa, non-harm
* "Jāti" means "creation" or "origination{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}}
* "Vāda" means "doctrine"{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}}

Taken together "ajātivāda" means "the Doctrine of no-origination"{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} or non-creation.

The concept of "ajāta" was borrowed by Gaudapada from Madhyamika Buddhism,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} which uses the term [[Anutpada|"anutpāda"]]:{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}}
* "An" also means "not", or "non"
* "Utpāda" means "genesis", "coming forth", "birth"&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=utpAda&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Utpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together "anutpāda" means "having no origin", "not coming into existence", "not taking effect", "non-production".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=anutpAda+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Anutpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
===Gaudapada===
{{See also|Prajnaparamita}}

"Ajātivāda" is the fundamental philosophical doctrine of [[Gaudapada]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} According to Gaudapada, the Absolute is not subject to [[Saṃsāra|birth, change and death]]. The Absolute is ''aja'', the unborn eternal.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} The [[Empiricism|empirical world]] of [[phenomenon|appearances]] is considered [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] (unreal as it is transitory), and not [[Philosophical realism|absolutely existent]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}}

Gaudapada borrowed the concept of "ajāta" from Nagajurna's  Madhyamaka philosophy.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} The Buddhist tradition usually uses the term "anutpāda" for the absence of an origin{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}} or śūnyatā.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=160}}{{refn|group=note|The term is also used in the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]''.{{sfn|Suzuki|1999}} According to D.T Suzuki, "anutpada" is not the opposite of "utpada", but transcends opposites. It is [[kenshō]], seeing into the true nature of existence,{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=123-124}} the seeing that "all objects are [[Śūnyatā|without self-substance]]".{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=168}} Another well-known use is in [[Bankei Yōtaku|Bankei's]] "Unborn".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=316}}}}

But Gaudapada's perspective is quite different from Nagarjuna.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} Gaudapada's perspective is based on the ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]''.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} In the ''Mandukya Karika'', Gaudapada's commentary on the ''Mandukya Upanishad'', Gaudapada sets forth his perspective. According to Gaudapada, Brahman cannot undergo alteration, so the phenomenal world cannot arise independently from Brahman. If the world cannot arise, yet is an empirical fact, than the world has to be an unreal (transitory) appearance of Brahman. And if the phenomenal world is a transitory appearance, then there is no real origination or destruction, only apparent origination or destruction. From the level of ultimate truth (''paramārthatā'') the phenomenal world is ''[[Maya (illusion)|māyā]]'', "illusion",{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} apparently existing but ultimately not real.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|2000|p=25, 160-161}}

In ''Gaudapada-Karika'', chapter III, verses 46-48, he states that [[Brahman]] never arises, is never born, is never unborn, it rests in itself:
{{quote|
When the mind does not lie low, and is not again tossed about, then that being without movement, and not presenting any appearance, culminates into [[Brahman]]. Resting in itself, calm, with Nirvana, indescribable, highest happiness, unborn and one with the unborn knowable, omniscient they say. No creature whatever is born, no origination of it exists or takes place. This is that highest truth where nothing whatever is born.
|Gaudapada Karika|3.46-48, Translated by RD Karmarkar&lt;ref&gt;RD Karmarkar, [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n83/mode/2up Gaudapada's Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Ajativada of Gaudapada, states Karmarkar, has nothing in common with the Sunyavada concept in Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;RD Karmarkar, [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n45/mode/2up/search/ajativada Gaudapada's Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages xxxix-xl&lt;/ref&gt; While the language of Gaudapada is undeniably similar to those found in Mahayana Buddhism, Coman states that their perspective is different because unlike Buddhism, Gaudapada is relying on the premise of "Brahman, [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or Turiya" exist and are the nature of absolute reality.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}}

===Ramana Maharshi===
{{Main|Ramana Maharshi}}

Ramana Maharshi gave a translation in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] of Gaudapada’s ''Mandukya Upanishad Karika'', chapter two, verse thirty-two:
{{quote|There is no creation, no destruction, no bondage, no longing to be freed from bondage, no striving to be free [from bondage], nor anyone who has attained [freedom from bondage]. Know that this is the ultimate truth.&lt;ref group=web name="Ajata"&gt;[http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.nl/2008/08/ajata.html David Godman, ''Ajata'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|David Godman: "This rendering appears as ‘Stray verse nine’ in Collected Works and as ‘Bhagavan 28’ in Guru Vachaka Kovai. Variations of this verse can also be found in the [[Amritabindu Upanishad]] (verse 10), Atma Upanishad (verse 30) and Vivekachudamani (verse 574)."&lt;ref group=web name="Ajata" /&gt;}}}}

According to David Godman, the ajata doctrine implies that since the world was never created, there are also no [[jiva]]s within it who are striving for or attaining liberation. Ramana Maharshi regarded this as "the ultimate truth."&lt;ref group=web name="Ajata" /&gt;

==Levels of truth==
{{See also|Two truths doctrine|Trikaya|Essence-Function}}

Advaita took over from the Madhyamika the idea of levels of reality.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=130}} Usually two levels are being mentioned,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} namely ''saṃvṛti-satya'', "the empirical truth",&lt;ref group=web name="EB-samvriti"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/520880/samvrti-satya Encyclopædia Britannica, ''saṃvṛti-satya'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''paramārtha-satya'', "ultimate truth".&lt;ref group=web name="EB-samvriti" /&gt; According to Plott, 
{{quote|"Ajativada is nothing but [an] extreme and exhaustive application of an extreme version of the distinction between the paramartha satya and the samvrtti satya."{{sfn|Plott|1980|p=283}}}}

The distinction between the two truths (''satyadvayavibhāga'') was fully expressed by the [[Madhyamaka|Madhyamaka-school]]. In [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna's]] ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' it is used to defend the identification of dependent origination (''pratītyasamutpāda'') with emptiness (''śūnyatā''):
{{quote|The Buddha's teaching of the Dharma is based on two truths: a truth of worldly convention and an ultimate truth. Those who do not understand the distinction drawn between these two truths do not understand the Buddha's profound truth. Without a foundation in the conventional truth the significance of the ultimate cannot be taught. Without understanding the significance of the ultimate, liberation is not achieved.{{sfn|Garfield|1995|p=296, 298, verse 24:8-10}}}}

Shankara uses [[Advaita Vedanta#Criterion of Sublation|sublation]] as the criterion to postulate an ontological hierarchy of three levels:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination&gt;[http://www.advaita-vision.org/discrimination/ advaita-vision.org, ''Discrimination'']&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{IAST|Pāramārthika}} (paramartha, absolute), the absolute level, "which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; This experience can't be sublated by any other experience.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}
# {{IAST|Vyāvahārika}} (vyavahara), or samvriti-saya{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} (empirical or pragmatical), "our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which both ''[[jiva]]'' (living creatures or individual souls) and ''[[Iswara]]'' are true; here, the material world is also true.
# {{IAST|Prāthibhāsika}} (pratibhasika, apparent reality, unreality), "reality based on imagination alone".&lt;ref group=web name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which appearances are actually false, like the illusion of a snake over a rope, or a dream.

It is at the level of the highest truth (''paramārtha'') that there is no origination.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}} Gaudapada states that, from the absolute standpoint, not even "non-dual" exists.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}}

==Advaita Vedanta and Madhyamaka Buddhism==
Many scholars, states Richard King, designate Madhyamaka Buddhism as ''Ajativada''.{{sfn|King|1995|p=138}} The concept ''Ajati'', he adds, exists in both Vedanta and Buddhism, but they are different in the following way:
{{quote|1. [[Anutpada|"There is no birth."]] (Madhyamaka), and
2. "There is an [[Brahman|Unborn]]." (Advaita Vedānta.){{sfn|King|1995|p=138}}}}

Ajativada in Madhyamaka refers to its doctrine that things neither originate nor is there cessation.{{Sfn|Murti|2008|p=343}} This is also called the theory of non-origination of Madhyamaka.{{Sfn|Murti|2008|p=343}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H. Potter |title=Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Volume 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCWU_ua5kxgC |year=1981|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn= 978-81-208-0310-7|pages=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45545">The '''ancient Egyptian units of measurement''' are those used by the [[Egyptian dynasties|dynasties]] of [[ancient Egypt]] prior to its incorporation in the [[Roman Empire]] and general adoption of [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman]], [[Ancient Greek units of measurement|Greek]], and [[Byzantine units of measurement]]. The units of length seem to have originally been [[anthropic units|anthropic]], based on various parts of the [[human body]], although these were standardized using cubit rods, strands of rope, and official measures maintained at some temples.

Following [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia|conquest]] of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] and subsequent death, his [[somatophylakes|bodyguard]] and [[diadochi|successor]] [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] assumed control in [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]], partially reforming its measurements, introducing some new units and hellenized names for others. 

==Length==
[[File:Egyptian circle.png|thumb|Egyptian Circle]]
Egyptian units of length are attested from the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic Period]]. Although it dates to the 5th dynasty, the [[Palermo stone]] recorded the level of the [[Nile River]] during the reign of the Early Dynastic [[pharaoh]] [[Djer]], when the height of the Nile was recorded as 6 cubits and 1 palm (about {{convert|3.217|m|ftin|abbr=on|sp=us|disp=or}}).&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; A [[Third dynasty of Egypt|3rd-dynasty]] diagram shows how to construct an elliptical vault using simple measures along an arc. The [[Saqqara ostracon|ostracon depicting this diagram]] was found near the [[Step Pyramid]] of [[Saqqara]]. A curve is divided into five sections and the height of the curve is given in cubits, palms, and digits in each of the sections.&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="EG"&gt;{{cite book|last=Englebach|first=Clarke|title=Ancient Egyptian Construction and Architecture|year=1990|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=0486264858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point, lengths were standardized by [[cubit]] rods. Examples have been found in the tombs of officials, noting lengths up to remen. Royal cubits were used for land measures such as roads and fields. Fourteen rods, including one double-cubit rod, were described and compared by [[Richard Lepsius|Lepsius]].{{sfnp|Lepsius|1865|pp=57 ff}} Two examples are known from the [[Saqqara]] tomb of [[Maya (Egyptian)|Maya]], the treasurer of [[Tutankhamun]]. Another was found in the tomb of Kha ([[TT8]]) in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. These cubits are about {{convert|52.5|cm|sp=us|abbr=on}} long and are divided into palms and hands: each palm is divided into four fingers from left to right and the fingers are further subdivided into ro from right to left. The rules are also divided into hands&lt;ref name="AE"/&gt; so that for example one foot is given as three hands and fifteen fingers and also as four palms and sixteen fingers.&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{harvp|Clagett|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardiner|first=Allen|title=Egyptian Grammar 3rd Edition|year=1994|publisher=Griffith Institute|location=Oxford|isbn=0900416351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ME"&gt;{{cite book|last=Faulkner|first=Raymond|title=A Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian|publisher=Griffith Institute Asmolean Museum, Oxford|year=1991|isbn=0900416327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MTP"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillings|first=Richard|title=Mathematics in the Time of the Pharaohs|year=1972|publisher=MIT|isbn=0262070456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AE"&gt;{{cite book|last=Loprieno|first=Antonio|title=Ancient Egyptian|publisher=CUP|location=New York|year=1996|isbn=0521448492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coudée-turin.jpg|thumb|550px|center|Cubit rod from the Turin Museum.]]

Surveying and itinerant measurement were undertaken using rods, poles, and knotted cords of rope. A scene in the tomb of [[Menna]] in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] shows surveyors measuring a plot of land using rope with knots tied at regular intervals. Similar scenes can be found in the tombs of Amenhotep-Sesi, Khaemhat and Djeserkareseneb. The balls of rope are also shown in [[New Kingdom]] statues of officials such as [[Senenmut]], Amenemhet-Surer, and Penanhor.&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;Corinna Rossi, Architecture and Mathematics in Ancient Egypt, Cambridge University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Area==
Records of land area also date to the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic Period]]. The [[Palermo stone]] records grants of land expressed in terms of ''kha'' and ''setat''. Mathematical papyri also include units of land area in their problems. For example, several problems in the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] give the area of rectangular plots of land in terms of ''setat'' and the ratio of the sides and then require the scribe to solve for their exact lengths.&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;

The ''setat'' was the basic unit of land measure and may originally have varied in size across Egypt's [[Egyptian nome|nome]]s.&lt;ref name=cnm/&gt; Later, it was equal to one square ''khet'', where a ''khet'' measured 100 ''cubits''. The ''setat'' could be divided into strips one ''khet'' long and ten ''cubit'' wide (a ''kha'').&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/weights/area.html Digital Egypt: Measuring area in Ancient Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt;

Weights were measured in terms of [[Deben (unit)|deben]]. This unit would have been equivalent to 13.6&amp;nbsp;grams in the [[Old Kingdom]] and [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].

The [[Egyptian civil calendar]] in place by [[Dynasty V]]{{sfnp|Clagett|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xKKPUpDOTKAC&amp;pg=PA28 28]}} followed [[regnal era]]s resetting with the ascension of each new [[pharaoh]].&lt;ref name=poormountaineer&gt;{{harvp|Clagett|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xKKPUpDOTKAC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the [[solar year]] and apparently initiated during a [[heliacal rising]] of [[Sirius]] following a recognition of its rough correlation with the onset of the Nile flood.{{sfnp|Parker|1950|p=23}} It followed none of these consistently, however. Its year was divided into 3 seasons, [[Egyptian calendar#months|12 months]], 36 [[decans]], or 360 [[day]]s with another 5 [[Egyptian intercalary month|epagomenal days]]{{sfnp|Parker|1950|p=7}}—celebrated as the birthdays of five major gods{{sfnp|Spalinger|1995|p=33}} but feared for their ill luck{{sfnp|Spalinger|1995|p=35}}—added "upon the year". The [[Egyptian months]] were originally simply numbered within each season{{sfnp|Parker|1950|pp=43–5}} but, in later sources, they acquired names from the year's major festivals{{sfnp|Clagett|1995|p=14–15}} and the three decans of each one were distinguished as "first", "middle", and "last".{{sfnp|Clagett|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xKKPUpDOTKAC&amp;pg=PA4 4]}} It has been suggested that during the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]] and the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] the last two days of each decan were usually treated as a kind of weekend for the royal craftsmen, with royal artisans free from work.{{sfnp|Jauhiainen|2009|p=39}} This scheme lacked any provision for [[leap year]] [[intercalation (calendar)|intercalation]] until the introduction of the [[Alexandrian calendar]] by [[Augustus]] in the 20s{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, causing it to slowly move through the [[Sothic cycle]] against the [[solar year|solar]], [[Sothic year|Sothic]], and [[Julian calendar|Julian years]].&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Clagett, Ancient Egyptian Science: Calendars, clocks, and astronomy, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Dates were typically given in a [[YMD format]].&lt;ref name=poormountaineer/&gt;

The civil calendar was apparently preceded by an observational [[lunar calendar]] which was eventually made [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]]{{efn|[[Richard Anthony Parker|Parker]] extensively developed the thesis that the predynastic lunar calendar was already [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], using [[intercalary month]]s every 2 or 3 years to maintain [[Sirius (star)|Sirius]]'s [[heliacal rising|return to the night sky]] in its twelfth month,{{sfnp|Parker|1950|pp=30–2}} but no evidence of such intercalation exists predating the schematic lunisolar calendar developed in {{nowrap|4th century {{sc|bc}}.{{sfnp|Tetley|2014|p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_10_resolving_the_eponymous_month_conflict.pdf 153]}}}}}} and fixed to the civil calendar, probably in 357{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.{{sfnp|Clagett|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xKKPUpDOTKAC&amp;pg=PA26 26]}} The months of these calendars were known as "temple months"{{sfnp|Parker|1950|p=17}} and used for liturgical purposes until the [[Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I#Persecution|closing of Egypt's pagan temples]] under [[Theodosius I]]&lt;ref&gt;Theodosian Code 16.10.12&lt;/ref&gt; in the {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}390s and the [[anti-paganism policies of the early Byzantine Empire|subsequent suppression of individual worship]] by [[list of Byzantine emperors|his successors]].{{sfn|Høyrup|p=13}}

Smaller units of time were vague approximations for most of Egyptian history. Hours—known by a variant of the word for "stars"{{sfnp|Vygus|2015|p=409}}—were initially only demarcated at night and varied in length. They were measured using [[Decans|decan]] stars and by [[water clock]]s. Equal 24-part divisions of the day were only introduced in 127{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. Division of these hours into 60 equal [[minute]]s is attested in [[Ptolemy]]'s 2nd-century works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59726">The '''British undergraduate degree classification''' system is a [[Grade (education)|grading]] structure for [[undergraduate degree]]s or [[bachelor's degree]]s and [[Master's degree#Integrated Masters Degree|integrated master's degrees]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The system has been applied (sometimes with significant variations) in other countries and regions.

== History ==
In the 16th century, the [[Regius Professor of Divinity]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] implemented [[Norm-referenced test|norm referencing]] to distinguish the top 25% of candidates, the next 50%, and the bottom 25%.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The classification system as currently used in the United Kingdom was developed in 1918. Honours were then a means to recognise individuals who demonstrated depth of knowledge or originality, as opposed to relative achievement in examination conditions.

Recently{{when|date=September 2018}}, there has been concern over possible [[grade inflation]] due to increasing numbers of higher-class honours degrees awarded per annum. The number of first-class honours degrees has reportedly tripled since the 1990s. As with claimed grade inflation of [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]], prospective employers or educational institutions have observed increased difficulty in selecting candidates. It is, however, unknown whether the rise in the number of first-class degrees is due to grade inflation or whether students are achieving higher levels than in the past. University leaders have also pointed at the higher A-levels attained by students as evidence that higher degree grades should be expected. On the other hand, the practice of degree classification has been criticised for unduly stigmatising students and being unreflective of a graduate's success or potential for success, particularly in the workplace.

== Degree classification ==
A bachelor's degree can be an ''[[honours degree]]'' (bachelor's with honours) or an ''ordinary degree'' (bachelor's without honours). Honours degrees are classified, usually based on a [[weighted average]] (with higher weight given to marks in the later years of the course, and often zero weight to those in the first year) of the marks gained in exams and other assessments. Grade boundaries can vary by institution, but typical values are given below.

* First-class honours (1st, 1 or I) – typically 70% or higher
* Second-class honours;
** Upper division (2:1, 2i or II-1) – typically 60–69%
** Lower division (2:2, 2ii or II-2) – typically 50–59%
* Third-class honours (3rd, 3 or III) – typically 40–49%

Students who do not achieve honours may be awarded an ordinary degree, sometimes known as a "pass". Ordinary degrees, and other exit awards such as the [[Diploma of Higher Education]] (DipHE; for completing the first two years of a degree course) and [[Certificate of Higher Education]] (CertHE; for completing the first year of a degree course), may be unclassified (pass/fail) or, particularly in Scotland where the ordinary degree is offered as a qualification in its own right, classified into pass, merit and distinction. [[Foundation degree]]s are normally classified into pass, merit and distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hull.ac.uk/fass/school-of-languages,-linguisti/undergraduate-study/student-handbook/general-university-regulations/your-degree-classification.aspx|title=Your degree classification|work=Student Handbook: General University Regulations|publisher=[[University of Hull]]|accessdate=16 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217142841/http://www2.hull.ac.uk/fass/school-of-languages,-linguisti/undergraduate-study/student-handbook/general-university-regulations/your-degree-classification.aspx|archivedate=17 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/academicservices/qualitymanual/assessmentandawards/degree-classification.aspx|title=Degree classification|publisher=[[University of Nottingham]]|accessdate=16 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218063419/https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/academicservices/qualitymanual/assessmentandawards/degree-classification.aspx|archivedate=18 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated master's degrees are usually classified with honours in the same way as a bachelor's honours degree, although some integrated master's degrees are classified like postgraduate taught master's degrees into pass (usually 50%), merit (60%) and distinction (70%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/masters_degree_grades/|title=Masters Degree Grades|website=Postgrad.com|accessdate=16 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217143015/https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/masters_degree_grades/|archivedate=17 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/students/academicadvice/degreeclassification.aspx|title=Degree classification|publisher=[[University of the West of England]]|accessdate=16 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217142754/http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/students/academicadvice/degreeclassification.aspx|archivedate=17 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At most institutions, the system allows a small amount of discretion.&lt;ref name="Seaton"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/apr/18/higher-education-degree-classification|title=Degree classification is unfair to many students|last=Seaton|first=Nigel|date=19 April 2011|work=The Guardian|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202005614/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/apr/18/higher-education-degree-classification|archivedate=2 December 2016|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A candidate may be elevated to the next degree class if his or her average marks are close to (or the [[median]] of their weighted marks achieves) the higher class, and if they have submitted several pieces of work worthy of the higher class.  However, even students with a high average mark may be unable to take honours if they have failed part of the course and so have insufficient credits.

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a bachelor's degree with honours normally takes three years of full-time study and usually requires 360 [[credit accumulation and transfer scheme|credits]], of which at least 90 are at level 6 (final year of a bachelor's degree) level, while an ordinary bachelor's degree normally requires 300 credits, of which 60 are at level 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2730#.WKWxz6gXZoM|title=Higher education credit framework for England: guidance on academic credit arrangements in higher education in England|isbn=9781844828708|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|date=August 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817191542/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2730#.WKWxz6gXZoM|archivedate=17 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, the honours bachelor's degree takes four years and requires 480 credits with a minimum of 90 at level 10 of the Scottish framework (last year of the honours degree) and 90 at level 9 (penultimate year), while the ordinary degree takes three years and requires 360 credits with a minimum of 60 at level 9 (last year of the ordinary degree).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scqf.org.uk/framework-diagram/Framework.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616065231/http://scqf.org.uk/framework-diagram/Framework.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 June 2014|title=Interactive framework|accessdate=16 February 2017|publisher=SCQF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, it is possible to start university a year younger than in the rest of the United Kingdom, as the Scottish [[Higher (Scottish)|Higher exams]] are often taken at age 16 or 17 (as opposed to 18), so Scottish students often end a four-year course at the same age as a student from elsewhere in the UK taking a three-year course, assuming no [[gap year]]s or students skipping the first year (direct entry to 2nd year).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/direct-entry/|title=Direct entry to second year {{!}} University of St Andrews|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a candidate is awarded a degree with honours, "(Hons)" may be suffixed to their designatory letters — for example, BA (Hons), BSc (Hons), BMus (Hons), MA (Hons).&lt;ref name=Eurydice&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/index.php/United-Kingdom-England:Bachelor#Certification|title=Bachelor|at=Certification|website=Eurydice|publisher=[[European Commission]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220094322/https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/index.php/United-Kingdom-England:Bachelor#Certification|archivedate=20 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An MA (Hons) would generally indicate a degree award from certain Scottish universities (c.f. [[Scottish MA]]) and is at the same level as a bachelor's degree. 
 
===Distribution of classes===

The [[Higher Education Statistics Agency]] (HESA) has published the number of degrees awarded with different classifications since 1994/5. The relative proportions of different classes have changed over this period, with increasing numbers of students being awarded higher honours. The table below shows the percentage of classified degrees (i.e. not including fails or unclassified degrees such as [[MBBS]]) in each class at five year intervals; note that HESA stopped giving statistics separately for third class honours and pass degree after 2003 and that a small number of undivided second class honours degrees (shown under "other" along with "unknown", which makes up the bulk of this category) were awarded up to 1996.

===First-class honours===
First-class honours, referred to as a "first", is the highest honours classification and indicates high academic achievement.

In 2010 and 2011, the [[Higher Education Statistics Agency]] (HESA) reported that approximately 15% of all degree candidates graduated with first-class honours.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2012/jan/12/first-class-degrees-concern|title=Is the number of first-class degrees cause for concern?|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404024912/http://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2012/jan/12/first-class-degrees-concern|archivedate=4 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HESA"&gt;[[Higher Education Statistics Agency]].

===Upper second-class honours {{anchor|Second-class honours}}===
{{Redirects here|2:1|an aspect ratio|Univisium}}
The upper division is commonly abbreviated to "2:1" or "II.i" (pronounced ''two-one'').  The 2:1 is a minimum requirement for entry to many postgraduate courses in the UK.  It is also required for the award of a [[research council]] postgraduate studentship in the UK, although possession of a master's degree can render a candidate eligible for an award if their initial degree was below the 2:1 standard.
The percentage of candidates who achieve upper second-class honours can vary widely by degree subject, as well as by university.&lt;ref name="HESA"/&gt;

===Lower second-class honours===
This is the lower division of second-class degrees and is abbreviated as "2:2" or "II.ii" (pronounced ''two-two''). It is also informally known as a "Desmond", named after [[Desmond Tutu]].

===Third-class honours===
Third-class honours, referred to as a "third", is the lowest honours classification in most modern universities. Historically, the University of Oxford awarded fourth-class honours degrees and, until the late 1970s, did not distinguish between upper and lower second-class honours degrees.&lt;ref name="Alderman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/oct/14/administration.highereducation|title=Tear up the class system|first=Geoffrey|last=Alderman|work=The Guardian|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000647/http://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/oct/14/administration.highereducation|archivedate=31 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Informally, the third-class honours degree is referred to as a "gentleman's degree" (''cf.'' the "gentleman's C" in the U.S.).&lt;ref name="Henley"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/shortcuts/2012/jul/04/dont-judge-job-applicant-by-degree|title=Don't judge a job applicant by their degree|first=Jon|last=Henley|work=The Guardian|date=5 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228211719/https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/shortcuts/2012/jul/04/dont-judge-job-applicant-by-degree|archivedate=28 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 7.2% of students graduating in 2006 with an honours degree received a third-class honours.&lt;ref name="HESA"/&gt;

===Ordinary degree===
While most university bachelor's degree courses lead to honours degrees, some universities offer courses leading to ordinary degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucas.com/ucas/undergraduate/getting-started/international-and-eu-students/ucas-terms-explained|title=UCAS terms explained|publisher=[[UCAS]]|accessdate=16 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217142621/https://www.ucas.com/ucas/undergraduate/getting-started/international-and-eu-students/ucas-terms-explained|archivedate=17 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some honours courses permit students who do not gain sufficient credits in a year by a small margin to transfer to a parallel ordinary degree course. Ordinary degrees may also sometimes be awarded to honours degree students who do not pass sufficient credits in their final year to gain an honours degree, but pass enough to earn an ordinary degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/faculty.handbook/faqs/?faqno=552|title=Faculty Handbook Online 2013/14: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Durham University|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107040202/https://www.dur.ac.uk/faculty.handbook/faqs/?faqno=552|archivedate=7 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Scottish universities offer three-year ordinary degrees as a qualification in their own right, as well as an honours degree over four years. This is in contrast to English universities that have honours degrees with three years of study. An ordinary degree in Scotland is not a failed honours degree, as in certain English universities. Students can decide, usually at the end of their second or third year, whether or not they wish to complete a fourth honours year. Scottish universities may also award their ordinary degrees with distinction if a student achieves a particularly good grade average, usually 70% or above. A common example of a Scottish ordinary degree is the [[Bachelor of Laws]] course taken by graduates of other subjects, as this is sufficient (without honours) for entry into the legal profession. In other countries, Malawi for example, Mzuzu University offers four year ordinary degrees. The degree follows the same classification as those in the United Kingdom. Grades attained in the last two years ( year three and four) including internship and dissertation, contribute to the final degree classification.

===Variations in classification===

At the [[University of Cambridge]], undergraduate [[Tripos]] examinations are split into three parts (e.g. Part IA, IB, and II), or two parts (Part I and II). Part II is taken at the end of final year. Each student receives a formal classification for each part (i.e. Class I, II.I, II.II, or III).&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/camdata/tripos.html|title=The structure of undergraduate courses at the University of Cambridge|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509185935/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/camdata/tripos.html|archivedate=9 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the Part II grade that corresponds with final examinations is quoted, but officially a grade simply exists for every Part of the degree, not for the overall degree.

At the [[University of Oxford]], a formal degree Class is given, and this is typically based on the final examinations. In Oxford, examinations for [[Prelims]] or [[Honour Moderations]] are also undertaken in first/second year, but these results do not typically affect the final degree classification. Until the 1970s, the four honours divisions in Oxford's moderations and final examinations were named first, second, third and fourth class, but eventually Oxford gave in and adopted the numbering used by other English universities.&lt;ref name="Alderman"/&gt;

====Variations of first-class honours====

At the [[University of Cambridge]], Triposes were previously split into two parts: Part I and Part II. Attaining First Class Honours in both parts would culminate in graduating with a "Double First".&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt; Most Triposes were later split into three parts: "Part IA," "Part IB" and "Part II", or "Part I", "Part IIA" and "Part IIB". Attaining a First Class in all three parts culminates in graduating with a "Triple First".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/archaeology-and-anthropology-careers-and-talks/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819042048/http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/archaeology-and-anthropology-careers-and-talks/ |archivedate=19 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/cv.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415040644/http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/cv.pdf |archivedate=15 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/once_a_caian._issue_8.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818193029/https://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/once_a_caian._issue_8.pdf |archivedate=18 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.society.caths.cam.ac.uk/Public_Magazines/1950r.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006040604/http://www.society.caths.cam.ac.uk/Public_Magazines/1950r.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrJp7LU5NL0C&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;ots=tNDjILyHrR&amp;sig=Uyi7UKpQrt6xVhqGS5o07Auy59I&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUs-KwkqPOAhVkIcAKHWtPDWM4HhDoAQg4MAU&amp;q=%22triple+first%22+cambridge|title=Musik im Exil: die Schweiz und das Ausland 1918-1945|first1=Chris|last1=Walton|first2=Antonio|last2=Baldassarre|date=29 December 2017|publisher=Peter Lang|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeeyetrust.org.uk/keithmartin.html|title=Cambridge Eye Trust - Professor Keith Martin|first=Peter|last=Watson|website=www.cambridgeeyetrust.org.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819052951/http://www.cambridgeeyetrust.org.uk/keithmartin.html|archivedate=19 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frequency of this honour varies with subject, but typically fewer than 3% of students will achieve this distinction.

At [[University College London]], candidates who perform well beyond the requirements of a standard First Class Honours may be nominated to the [[Dean's List]].

===South Africa===
The South African Qualifications Authority&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saqa.org.za/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816121445/http://www.saqa.org.za/ |archivedate=16 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (SAQA) compares international degrees with local degrees before any international student continues their studies in that country.  While the British degree accreditation and classification system allows students to go straight from a three-year bachelor's degree onto a master's degree (normally requiring a 1st or a 2:1 – those with a 2:2 or a 3rd usually require appropriate professional experience),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prospects.ac.uk/postgraduate-study/masters-degrees/should-i-do-a-masters|title=Should I do a Masters?|publisher=Prospects|at=Can I do a Masters with a 2:2 or a third?|accessdate=15 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216132355/https://www.prospects.ac.uk/postgraduate-study/masters-degrees/should-i-do-a-masters|archivedate=16 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa does not do so unless the student has proven research capabilities.  South African Honours degrees prepare the students to undertake a research-specific degree (in terms of master's), by spending an in-depth year (up to 5 modules) creating research proposals and undertaking a research project of limited scope.  This prepares students for the research degrees later in their academic career.

NUFFIC also noted that the grading culture is different in the Netherlands, so that it is very rare for even the best students in the Netherlands to be awarded a 9 or a 10, which represent near perfection and absolute perfection.&lt;ref name="Nuffic"/&gt;

===United States and Canada===

British honours degrees are sometimes considered equivalent (by British sources) to a US master's degree, with the US bachelor's degree being equivalent to a British pass degree, due to the much higher degree of specialisation in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quality and standards|chapter=Appendix 5: Higher education in other countries|url=https://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/ncihe/a5_083.htm|quote=7.21 The team gained the impression, based on an inspection of syllabuses and examination papers, that the American high school diploma compares in standard with GCSE and the associate degree with GCE A-level and Advanced GNVQ, the bachelor’s degree with a UK pass degree or higher national diploma and the Master’s degree with a bachelor’s honours degree from a British university. Further evidence for this conclusion: Howard University in Washington, a university in which over 99 per cent of undergraduates are black, admits overseas applicants from the West Indies with five GCE O-level grades at A-C to the freshman year of their bachelor’s degree programme; Johns Hopkins, one of the most prestigious of the private universities, states in its prospectus that advanced placement is available for students entering with either International Baccalauréat or GCE A-level. The rider must be added, however, that an American education is very much more general than a UK education right up to bachelor’s level; it would hardly be reasonable, therefore, to expect the same standard to be reached in the major subject. It was also noted that, in the highest quality institutions, some individual modules taken by senior students compared well in level with UK final honours standard. A given student would take rather fewer of these more demanding modules than a UK student, however.|work=[[Dearing Report|The National Committee of Enquiry into Higher Education (Dearing Report)]]|author=[[Ronald Dearing, Baron Dearing|Ron Dearing]]|date=23 July 1997|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024033713/http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/ncihe/a5_083.htm|archivedate=24 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org:80/eis/quusa.htm|title=Comparing your US qualifications with those in the UK|publisher=[[British Council]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001135341/http://www.britishcouncil.org/eis/quusa.htm|archive-date=1 October 2002|quote=Master's degree - in terms of specialisation, the American Master's degree from prestigious colleges and universities is considered comparable to the British Bachelor (Honours) degree. Candidates who have followed academically rigorous programmes have reached a standard comparable to that of a British taught Master's degree.|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many British institutions accept US bachelor's degrees for admission to postgraduate study (see below) and US comparison services treat British and American degrees as equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wenr.wes.org/2016/02/education-in-the-u-k|title=Education in the U.K.|publisher=[[World Education Services]]|date=2 February 2016|accessdate=26 May 2017|quote=The programs result in degrees such as the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Engineering, Bachelor of Laws, and Bachelor of Education, all of which are equivalent to a bachelor’s degree in the U.S. system.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030191855/http://wenr.wes.org/2016/02/education-in-the-u-k|archivedate=30 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When US bachelor's degrees are compared to British honours degrees, equivalencies can be expressed in terms of either [[Academic grading in the United States#Grade point average|US Grade Point Averages]] (GPAs) or letter grades.

British institutions normally state equivalence in terms of GPAs. Approximate mappings between British classifications and GPAs can be inferred from the graduate admissions criteria used by British universities, which often give international equivalents. For example, [[University College London]] (UCL)  equates the minimum classification for entrance to GPAs using 1st = 3.6, 2:1 = 3.3 and 2:2 = 3.0.&lt;ref name="UCL GPA"&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate-study/application-admission/general-entrance-requirement General entrance requirements], ''[[University College London]]'' {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/68jMWWbvT?url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate-study/application-admission/general-entrance-requirement |date=27 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, different universities convert grades differently: the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] (LSE) considers a GPA (U.S.) of 3.5 or better as equivalent to gaining a 2:1,&lt;ref name="LSE entrance requirement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/graduateProspectus2010/entryRequirements/Home.aspx#generated-subheading1|title=Entry requirements|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315090824/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/graduateProspectus2010/entryRequirements/Home.aspx#generated-subheading1|archive-date=15 March 2010|publisher=LSE|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the department of English Language and Literature at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] considers a GPA of "about 3.8" equivalent to a first class degree.&lt;ref name="Oxford English Language and Literature entrance requirement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate_courses/course_guide/english_language_.html|title=English Language &amp; Literature|publisher=University of Oxford|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113014632/http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate_courses/course_guide/english_language_.html|archive-date=13 November 2010|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the UK NARIC gives equivalent GPAs for determining eligibility for teacher training bursaries.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"/&gt; In contrast,  [[Durham University]]'s ''North American Undergraduate Guide 2017'' gives a conversion table as a guide to understanding British classifications (rather than for admission to postgraduate study) of 1st = 3.8–4.0, 2:1 = 3.3–3.7, 2:2 = 2.8–3.2 and  3rd = 2.3–2.7.&lt;ref name="Durham GPA"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://issuu.com/communicationsoffice/docs/4230-duio_ug_north_america_brochure|title=North American Undergraduate Guide|publisher=Durham University|date=20 August 2017|website=ISSUU|accessdate=3 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506164715/https://issuu.com/communicationsoffice/docs/4230-duio_ug_north_america_brochure|archivedate=6 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Academic grading in Canada|Canadian academic grades]] may be given as letters, percentages, 12-point GPAs or 4-point GPAs. The 4-point GPAs are sometimes seen to differ from the US but other sources treat them as equivalent. The Durham conversion specifies GPAs for the US and letter grades/percentages for Canada&lt;ref name="Durham GPA"/&gt; while the UK NARIC has separate GPA conversions for the four-year bachelor's honours, baccalauréat and professional bachelor's degrees (which differ from their US GPA equivalents by at most 0.1) and the three-year bachelor's degree (which is seen as a lower standard).&lt;ref name="gov.uk"/&gt;  The ''British Graduate Admissions Fact Sheet'' from [[McGill University]] uses the conversion 1st = 4.0; 2:1 = 3.0; 2:2 = 2.7; 3rd = 2.0; Pass = 1.0; Fail = 0.0.&lt;ref name="McGill equiv"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secureweb.mcgill.ca/gradapplicants/sites/mcgill.ca.gradapplicants/files/UNITED_KINGDOM.pdf|title=Future graduate students: European Fact Sheets – UK|publisher=McGill University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403132112/https://secureweb.mcgill.ca/gradapplicants/sites/mcgill.ca.gradapplicants/files/UNITED_KINGDOM.pdf|archive-date=3 April 2015|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Degrees in the UK are mapped to levels of the [[Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies]] (FHEQ), which includes the Framework for Qualifications of Higher Education Institutes in Scotland (FQHEIS), which has an alternative numbering of levels corresponding to those of the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF). Bachelor's degrees (including the [[Scottish MA]], but not including [[MB BS|medical degrees]], dentistry degrees or degrees in veterinary science) attained in the UK are at FHEQ level 6/FQHEIS level 9 (ordinary) or 10 (honours); master's degrees (including integrated master's degrees and first degrees in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science) are at FHEQ level 7/FQHEIS level 11, and doctoral degrees are at FHEQ level 8/FQHEIS level 12. Bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees map to first, second and third cycle qualifications in the [[Bologna Process#Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area|Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scqf.org.uk/framework-diagram/Framework.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616065231/http://scqf.org.uk/framework-diagram/Framework.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-06-16|title=The Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/qualifications-frameworks.pdf|title=The Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education]]|date=November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305083730/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/qualifications-frameworks.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progression to postgraduate study==
Regulations governing the progression of undergraduate degree graduates to postgraduate programmes vary among universities, and are often flexible.  A candidate for a postgraduate master's degree is usually required to have at least a 2:2 bachelor honours degree, although candidates with 2:1s are in a considerably stronger position to gain a place in a postgraduate course and to obtain funding, especially in medical and natural sciences.  Some institutions specify a 2:1 minimum for certain types of master's program, such as for a [[Master of Research]] course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/gsprospectus/applying/entry.html Entrance requirements: Graduate Prospectus 2010–11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913073724/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/gsprospectus/applying/entry.html |date=13 September 2008 }}, ''[[University of Cambridge]]'', September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://lfylive.lse.ac.uk/lfy/tc/enquiries/enquiry.html?a=4&amp;q=565 What are the entry requirements for graduate programmes at LSE?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009014628/https://lfylive.lse.ac.uk/lfy/tc/enquiries/enquiry.html?a=4&amp;q=565 |date=9 October 2011 }}, ''[[London School of Economics]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates with a Third or an Ordinary degree are sometimes accepted, provided they have acquired satisfactory professional experience subsequent to graduation.  A candidate for a doctoral programme who does not hold a master's degree is nearly always required to have a First or 2:1 at bachelor's level.

==Variations==

===International degrees===

====Australia====
Some universities, such as those in Australia, offer ordinary or pass degrees, (for instance, as a three-year B.A. or a three-year BSc) by default.  High-achieving students may be recognised with an honours classification without further coursework or research, as is often the case in engineering, which often contains a research and thesis component,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2012/B-ENG|title=BEng (Bachelor of Engineering)|work=University of Melbourne Handbook|publisher=University of Melbourne|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722101206/https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2012/B-ENG|archivedate=22 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.unsw.edu.au/info-about/our-faculty/faculty-policies/honours-policy|title=Honours Policy|publisher=Faculty of Engineering, University of New South Wales|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702165314/http://www.eng.unsw.edu.au/info-about/our-faculty/faculty-policies/honours-policy|archivedate=2 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/current-students/my-academic-life/honours|title=Honours|publisher=UNSW Faculty of Law|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516014028/http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/current-students/my-academic-life/honours|archivedate=16 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other courses (such as humanities, arts, social sciences, and sciences) and other universities may recognise high-achieving students with an honours classification with further coursework or research, undertaken either concurrently with, and as part of or in addition to, a bachelor's course,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/law/cstudent/undergrad/honours_program.shtml|title="New" Honours Program|publisher=Sydney Law School|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716063911/http://sydney.edu.au/law/cstudent/undergrad/honours_program.shtml|archivedate=16 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or after completion of a bachelor's course requirements and attaining adequately competitive grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/currentstudents/honours-mathematics-and-statistics|title=The Honours Year|publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of New South Wales|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813034354/http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/currentstudents/honours-mathematics-and-statistics|archivedate=13 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asb.unsw.edu.au/schools/economics/programsandcourses/honours/Pages/default.aspx|title=Honours – Programs &amp; courses – Economics|publisher=Australian School of Business, University of New South Wales|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003205335/http://www.asb.unsw.edu.au/schools/economics/programsandcourses/honours/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=3 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To comply with this standard, some institutions have commenced, or will commence, offering high-achieving graduates with "distinction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/sites/law.unsw.edu.au/files/images/jd_honours_policy_from_2015.pdf|title=Law JD Honours as of 2015|publisher=UNSW Faculty of Law|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403133957/http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/sites/law.unsw.edu.au/files/images/jd_honours_policy_from_2015.pdf|archivedate=3 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, this is consistent with British graduate degree classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/academicregulations/taughtmastersdegreesfourunits.htm|title=Taught Masters Degree|publisher=London School of Economics|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719070843/http://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/academicregulations/taughtmastersdegreesfourunits.htm|archivedate=19 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British medical and dental degrees===
In the United Kingdom, medicine is usually taught as an undergraduate course, with graduates being awarded a master's level qualification: normally the conjoined degrees of [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS, BM BCh, MB ChB, etc.) although at [[Queen's University Belfast]] (and universities in Ireland) Bachelor in the Art of Obstetrics (BAO) is added, and at some universities only the [[Bachelor of Medicine]] is awarded - all of these have equal standing. Unlike most undergraduate degrees, the MBBS is not normally considered an honours degree, and thus is not classified into first class honours, etc. Students may be awarded "Merits" and "Distinctions" for parts of the course or the whole course (depending on the institution) and "Honours" may be awarded at some institutions for exceptional performance throughout the course (as a grade above Distinction).&lt;ref name="QAA medicine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/Subject-benchmark-statement-Medicine.pdf|title=Subject benchmark statement - Medicine|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122221116/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/Subject-benchmark-statement-Medicine.pdf|archivedate=22 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/regulations/programme/2016-2017/documents/A101A1001500UProgrammeRegulations.pdf|title=MBBS Programme Regulations 2016/17|publisher=[[Newcastle University]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223125936/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/regulations/programme/2016-2017/documents/A101A1001500UProgrammeRegulations.pdf|archivedate=23 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical schools split their year groups into one of 10 [[decile]]s.  These deciles are the major factor in the calculation of Educational Performance Measure (EPM) points used as part of medical students' [[Foundation Programme]] applications, with the top decile receiving 43 points, decreasing by a point for each decile (so the lowest gets 34 points); 7 points can be awarded for other educational achievements (other degrees and publications), and the EPM points are combined with up to 50 points from the Situational Judgement Test to give a total out of 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/pages/fp-afp/faqs/EPM|title=EPM FAQs|publisher=[[National Health Service]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223130240/http://www.foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/pages/fp-afp/faqs/EPM|archivedate=23 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/download.asp?file=FP_AFP_Applicants_Handbook_2017.pdf|title=FP/AFP 2017 Applicant's Handbook|publisher=[[National Health Service]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223212536/http://www.foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/download.asp?file=FP_AFP_Applicants_Handbook_2017.pdf|archivedate=23 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Grade Point Average==
Following the recommendation of the Burgess report into the honours degree classification system in 2007, the [[Higher Education Academy]] ran a pilot in 2013–2014 in collaboration with 21 institutions delivering higher education (ranging from [[Russell Group]] universities to [[Further Education]] colleges) to investigate how a Grade Point Average (GPA) system would work best in Britain. Two main weighting systems were tested: an American-style average of all marks, weighted only by credit value, and weighting by "exit velocity" in the manner of the honours classification, where modules in the first year are given a low or zero weight and modules in the final year have a higher weight (a third model was only rarely used). Over two thirds of providers preferred exit-velocity weighting to the straight average.&lt;ref name="GPA report"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resource/grade-point-average-report-gpa-pilot-project-2013-14|title=Grade point average: Report of the GPA pilot project 2013-14|date=28 May 2015|publisher=Higher Education Academy|accessdate=23 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224134517/https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resource/grade-point-average-report-gpa-pilot-project-2013-14|archivedate=24 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A GPA scale, tied to percentage marks and letter grades, was recommended for use nationally following the study, to run in parallel with the honours degree classification system.&lt;ref name="GPA report"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2482">The '''Buchholz system''' (also spelled Buchholtz) is a ranking or scoring system in [[chess]] developed by Bruno Buchholz (died ca. 1958) in 1932, for [[Swiss system]] tournaments {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992}}.  It was originally developed as an auxiliary scoring method, but more recently it has been used as a tie-breaking system.  It was probably first used in the 1932 Bitterfeld tournament.  It was designed to replace the [[Neustadtl score]] {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992}}.

The method is to give each player a raw score of one point for each win and a half point for each [[draw (chess)|draw]]. When used as an alternate scoring system, each player's Buchholz score is calculated by adding the raw scores of each of the opponents he played and multiplying this total by the player's raw score {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992}}.  When used for tie-breaking among players with the same raw score, no multiplying is necessary and the sum of the raw scores of the opponents played is used to break ties {{harvcol|Golombek|1977}}.  When used as a tie-break system, it is equivalent to the [[Tie-breaking in Swiss-system tournaments#Solkoff|Solkoff system]].

The major criticism of this system is that tie-break scores can be distorted by the set of opponents that each player plays (especially in early rounds). To avoid this problem a version of Buchholz, the '''Median-Buchholz System''' is sometimes used. In the Median-Buchholz System the best and worst scores of a player's opponents are discarded, and the remaining scores summed.

'''Consensus reality'''&lt;ref&gt;"Reality by Consensus": An Analysis of the Metapragmatic and Therapeutic Dimensions of Vampiric Live Action Role-playing. Reviews Indiana University, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quantum Consciousness. By Lily Splane. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gnjxnq7ZRTAC&amp;pg=PA51 Pg 51]&lt;/ref&gt; is that which is generally agreed to be [[reality]], based on a [[consensus]] view.

The appeal to consensus arises from the fact that humans do not fully understand or agree upon the nature of [[knowledge]] or [[ontology]], often making it uncertain what is real, given the vast inconsistencies between individual [[subjectivity|subjectivities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the Mind |last=Lakoff |first=George |authorlink=George Lakoff |year=1987 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-46804-6 |pages=259 |quote=In summary, Putnam has shown that existing formal versions of objectivist ''epistemology'' are inconsistent; there can be no objectively correct ''description'' of reality from a God's eye point of view. This does not, of course, mean that there is no objective reality—only that we have no ''privileged access'' to it from an external viewpoint.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reason, Truth, and History |last=Putnam |first=Hilary |authorlink=Hilary Putnam |year=1981 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; We can, however, seek to obtain some form of consensus, with others, of what is real. We can use this consensus as a pragmatic guide, either on the assumption that it seems to approximate some kind of valid reality, or simply because it is more "practical" than perceived alternatives. Consensus reality therefore refers to the agreed-upon concepts of reality which people in the world, or a culture or group, believe are real (or treat as real), usually based upon their common experiences as they believe them to be; anyone who does not agree with these is sometimes stated to be "in effect... living in a different world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David G., editor |last=Stork |title=Hal's Legacy: 2001's Computer as Dream and Reality |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-69211-2 |page=201 |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history this has also raised a social question as to the effects of a society in which all individuals do not agree upon the same reality.

Children have sometimes been described or viewed as "inexperience[d] with consensus reality,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lois |last=Rostow Kuznets |title=When Toys Come Alive: Narratives of Animation, Metamorphosis, and Development |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1994 |isbn=0-300-05645-1 |pages=228, note 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; though are described as such with the expectation that their perspective will progressively form closer to the consensus reality of their society as they age.

==General discussion==
In considering the nature of reality, two broad approaches exist: the [[philosophical realism|realist]] approach, in which there is a single, [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], overall reality believed to exist irrespective of the [[philosophy of perception|perceptions]] of any given individual, and the [[idealism|idealistic]] approach, in which it is considered that an individual can verify nothing except their own ''[[experience]]'' of the world, and can never directly know the truth of the world independent of that.

Consensus reality may be understood by studying [[socially constructed reality]], a subject within the [[sociology of knowledge]]. (Read page three of ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]'' by [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]].)

Consider this example: consensus reality for people who follow a particular theocentric religion is different from consensus reality for those who follow another theocentric religion, or from those that eschew theocentric religions in favor of [[science]] alone, for explaining life and the [[universe]].

In societies where theocentric religions are dominant, the religious understanding of existence would be the consensus reality, while the religious worldview would remain the non-consensus (or alternative) reality in a predominantly [[secular]] society, where the consensus reality is grounded in science alone.

In this way, different individuals and communities have fundamentally different [[world view]]s,&lt;ref name="ken_wilber_1"&gt;According to philosopher [[Ken Wilber]]. See Ken Wilber's book ''A Brief History of Everything''.&lt;/ref&gt; with fundamentally different comprehensions of the world around them, and of the constructs within which they live. Thus, a society that is, for example, completely secular and one which believes every eventuality to be subject to metaphysical influence will have very different consensus realities, and many of their beliefs on broad issues such as [[science]], [[slavery]], and [[human sacrifice]] may differ in direct consequence because of the differences in the perceived nature of the world they live in.

==In science and philosophy==
{{See also|Scientific consensus}}

===Idealists===
Some [[idealists]] ([[subjective idealism|subjective idealists]]) hold the view that there isn't one particular way things are, but rather that each person's [[private language argument | personal reality]] is unique. Such idealists have the [[world view]] which says that we each create our own reality, and while most people may be in general agreement (consensus) about what reality is like, they might live in a different (or nonconsensus) reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkuVBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=subjective+idealism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7ivm4kIrZAhVHWqwKHb5BBfsQ6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Kantian Reason and Hegelian Spirit: The Idealistic Logic of Modern Theology|last=Dorrien|first=Gary|date=2015-03-16|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781119016540|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materialists===
[[Materialists]] may not accept the idea of there being different possible realities for different people, rather than different beliefs about one [[reality]]. So for them only the first usage of the term reality would make sense. To them, someone believing otherwise, where the facts have been properly established, might be considered [[delusion]]al.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Social consequences==

===Views on the term===
The [[connotation]] of the term "consensus reality" is usually disparaging: it is usually employed by [[idealist]], [[surrealist]] and other [[anti-realist]] [[theorist]]s opposing or hostile to this "reality," with the implication that this consensus reality is, to a greater or lesser extent, created by those who experience it. (The phrase "consensus reality" may be used more loosely to refer to any generally accepted set of beliefs.) However, there are those who use the term approvingly for the practical benefits of all agreeing on a common set of assumptions or experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zane Crawford |title=ideotrope: consensus reality |url=https://ideotrope.org/index.pl?node_id=659 |accessdate=2007-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928103508/https://ideotrope.org/index.pl?node_id=659 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="954">A '''conservation headland''' is a strip along the edge of an [[agricultural]] field, where [[pesticide]]s is sprayed only in a selective manner. This increases the number and type of [[weed]] and insect species present, and benefits the bird species that depend on them. The [[grey partridge]] is one such bird.
Conservation headlands were introduced in the 1980s by scientists working for [[Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust]] in [[Great Britain]]. Trials have taken place in southern [[Sweden]].

[[File:Charles Darwin by Julia Margaret Cameron 2.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Darwin]] in 1868]]

'''Darwinism''' is a [[scientific theory|theory]] of [[Biology|biological]] [[evolution]] developed by the English naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882) and others, stating that all [[species]] of organisms arise and develop through the [[natural selection]] of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and [[reproduction|reproduce]]. Also called '''Darwinian theory''', it originally included the broad concepts of [[transmutation of species]] or of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance after Darwin published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, including concepts which predated Darwin's theories. It subsequently referred to the specific concepts of natural selection, the [[Weismann barrier]], or the [[central dogma of molecular biology]].&lt;ref name="antidarwinian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/anti-darwin.html |title=So You Want to be an Anti-Darwinian: Varieties of Opposition to Darwinism |last=Wilkins |first=John |date=21 December 1998 |website=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the term usually refers strictly to biological evolution, [[creationism|creationists]] have appropriated it to refer to the [[abiogenesis|origin of life]], and it has even been applied to concepts of [[Physical cosmology|cosmic evolution]], both of which have no connection to Darwin's work. It is therefore considered the belief and acceptance of Darwin's and of his predecessors' work—in place of other theories, including [[Teleological argument|divine design]] and [[Panspermia|extraterrestrial origins]].&lt;ref name="EOflunks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://expelledexposed.drupalgardens.com/contest/on-what-evolution-explains |title=…on what evolution explains |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Expelled Exposed |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |location=Oakland, CA |accessdate=2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GalacticDarwinism"&gt;{{cite press release |last1=Le Fèvre |first1=Olivier |last2=Marinoni |first2=Christian |date=6 December 2006 |title=Do Galaxies Follow Darwinian Evolution? |url=https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0645/ |location=Marseille, France |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory]] |id=eso0645 |accessdate=2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] coined the term ''Darwinism'' in April 1860.&lt;ref name="westminster"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huxley |first=T.H. |authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley |date=April 1860 |title=ART. VIII.—Darwin on the Origin of Species |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=A32&amp;pageseq=29 |journal=[[Westminster Review]] |type=Book review |location=London |publisher=Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy |volume=17 |pages=541–570 |accessdate=2008-06-19 |quote=What if the orbit of Darwinism should be a little too circular?}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used to describe evolutionary concepts in general, including earlier concepts published by English philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]]. Many of the proponents of Darwinism at that time, including Huxley, had reservations about the significance of natural selection, and Darwin himself gave credence to what was later called [[Lamarckism]]. The strict [[neo-Darwinism]] of German evolutionary biologist [[August Weismann]] gained few supporters in the late 19th century. During the approximate period of the 1880s to about 1920, sometimes called "[[the eclipse of Darwinism]]", scientists proposed various [[Alternatives to Darwinism|alternative evolutionary mechanisms]] which eventually proved untenable.  The development of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the early 20th century, incorporating natural selection with [[population genetics]] and [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]], revived Darwinism in an updated form.&lt;ref name="b222"&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=179, 222–225, 338–339, 347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term ''Darwinism'' has remained in use amongst the public when referring to modern evolutionary theory, it has increasingly been argued by science writers such as [[Olivia Judson]] and [[Eugenie Scott]] that it is an inappropriate term for modern evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name="Scott Branch 09"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Eugenie C. |authorlink1=Eugenie Scott |last2=Branch |first2=Glenn |authorlink2=Glenn Branch |date=16 January 2009 |title=Don't Call it 'Darwinism' |journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |location=New York |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=90–94 |doi=10.1007/s12052-008-0111-2 |issn=1936-6426}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Judson |first=Olivia |authorlink=Olivia Judson |date=15 July 2008 |title=Let's Get Rid of Darwinism |url=http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/lets-get-rid-of-darwinism/ |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Darwin was unfamiliar with the work of the [[Moravia]]n scientist and [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[friar]] [[Gregor Mendel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sclater|first=Andrew|date=June 2006|title=The extent of Charles Darwin's knowledge of Mendel|journal=[[Journal of Biosciences]]|location=Bangalore, India|publisher=[[Indian Academy of Sciences]] / Springer India|volume=31|issue=2|pages=191–193|doi=10.1007/BF02703910|issn=0250-5991|pmid=16809850}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2009-01-03--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result had only a vague and inaccurate understanding of [[heredity]]. He naturally had no inkling of later theoretical  developments and, like Mendel himself, knew nothing of [[genetic drift]], for example.&lt;ref name="GeneticDrift"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/genetic-drift.html |title=Random Genetic Drift |last=Moran |first=Laurence |date=22 January 1993 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/darwinism.html |title=What is Darwinism? |last=Hanes |first=Joel |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, creationists often use the term "Darwinism" as a [[pejorative]] term in reference to beliefs such as [[Metaphysical naturalism|scientific materialism]], but in the United Kingdom the term has no negative connotations, being freely used as a shorthand for the body of theory dealing with evolution, and in particular, with evolution by natural selection.&lt;ref name="Scott Branch 09" /&gt;

==Conceptions of Darwinism==
[[File:Editorial cartoon depicting Charles Darwin as an ape (1871).jpg|thumb|As [[evolution]] became widely accepted in the 1870s, [[Caricatures of Charles Darwin and his evolutionary theory in 19th-century England|caricatures of Charles Darwin]] with the body of an ape or monkey symbolised evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=376–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

While the term ''Darwinism'' had been used previously to refer to the work of [[Erasmus Darwin]] in the late 18th century, the term as understood today was introduced when Charles Darwin's 1859 book ''On the Origin of Species'' was reviewed by Thomas Henry Huxley in the April 1860 issue of the ''[[Westminster Review]]''.&lt;ref name="urlThe Huxley File § 4 Darwins Bulldog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/guide4.html |title=Darwin's Bulldog |last1=Blinderman |first1=Charles |last2=Joyce |first2=David |website=The Huxley File |publisher=[[Clark University]] |location=Worcester, MA |accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having hailed the book as "a veritable [[Joseph Whitworth#Whitworth rifle|Whitworth gun]] in the armoury of liberalism" promoting [[naturalism (philosophy)|scientific naturalism]] over [[theology]], and praising the usefulness of Darwin's ideas while expressing professional reservations about Darwin's [[gradualism]] and doubting if it could be proved that natural selection could form new species,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley compared Darwin's achievement to that of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in explaining planetary motion:
{{quotation|What if the orbit of Darwinism should be a little too circular? What if species should offer residual phenomena, here and there, not explicable by natural selection? Twenty years hence naturalists may be in a position to say whether this is, or is not, the case; but in either event they will owe the author of "The Origin of Species" an immense debt of gratitude.... And viewed as a whole, we do not believe that, since the publication of Von Baer's "Researches on Development," thirty years ago, any work has appeared calculated to exert so large an influence, not only on the future of Biology, but in extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated.&lt;ref name="westminster" /&gt;}}

These are the basic tenets of evolution by natural selection as defined by Darwin:

# More individuals are produced each generation that can survive.
# Phenotypic variation exists among individuals and the variation is heritable.
# Those individuals with heritable traits better suited to the environment will survive.
# When reproductive isolation occurs new species will form.

Another important evolutionary theorist of the same period was the Russian geographer and prominent anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] who, in his book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' (1902), advocated a conception of Darwinism counter to that of Huxley. His conception was centred around what he saw as the widespread use of co-operation as a survival mechanism in human societies and animals. He used biological and [[Sociology|sociological]] arguments in an attempt to show that the main factor in facilitating evolution is cooperation between individuals in free-associated societies and groups. This was in order to counteract the conception of fierce [[Competition (biology)|competition]] as the core of evolution, which provided a [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] for the dominant political, economic and social theories of the time; and the prevalent interpretations of Darwinism, such as those by Huxley, who is targeted as an opponent by Kropotkin. Kropotkin's conception of Darwinism could be summed up by the following quote:

{{quotation|In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense—not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kropotkin|1902|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Peter Kropotkin|Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1902), Conclusion}}

==19th-century usage==
"Darwinism" soon came to stand for an entire range of evolutionary (and often revolutionary) philosophies about both biology and society. One of the more prominent approaches, summed in the 1864 phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]" by Herbert Spencer, later became emblematic of Darwinism even though Spencer's own understanding of evolution (as expressed in 1857) was more similar to that of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] than to that of Darwin, and predated the [[publication of Darwin's theory]] in 1859. What is now called "[[Social Darwinism]]" was, in its day, synonymous with "Darwinism"—the application of Darwinian principles of "struggle" to society, usually in support of anti-[[philanthropy|philanthropic]] political agenda. Another interpretation, one notably favoured by Darwin's half-cousin [[Francis Galton]], was that "Darwinism" implied that because natural selection was apparently no longer working on "civilized" people, it was possible for "inferior" strains of people (who would normally be filtered out of the [[gene pool]]) to overwhelm the "superior" strains, and voluntary corrective measures would be desirable—the foundation of [[eugenics]].

{{anchor|Darwinismus}}
In Darwin's day there was no rigid definition of the term "Darwinism", and it was used by opponents and proponents of Darwin's biological theory alike to mean whatever they wanted it to in a larger context. The ideas had international influence, and [[Ernst Haeckel]] developed what was known as ''Darwinismus'' in Germany, although, like Spencer's "evolution", Haeckel's "Darwinism" had only a rough resemblance to the theory of Charles Darwin, and was not centered on natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt S. (2009). ''Haeckel: A German Darwinian?'' Comptes Rendus Biologies: 332: 110-118.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] went on a lecture tour across the United States, starting in New York and going via Boston, Washington, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska to California, lecturing on what he called "Darwinism" without any problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Evolution and Wonder: Understanding Charles Darwin |url=http://www.onbeing.org/program/evolution-and-wonder-understanding-charles-darwin/transcript/899#main_content |accessdate=2015-11-16 |series=[[On Being|Speaking of Faith with Krista Tippett]] |first1=Krista (host) |last1=Tippett |authorlink1=Krista Tippett |first2=James |last2=Moore |authorlink2=James Moore (biographer) |network=[[NPR]] |type=Transcript |airdate=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'' (1889), Wallace had used the term ''pure-Darwinism'' which proposed a "greater efficacy" for [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Alfred Russel. (1889). [https://archive.org/stream/darwinismexposit00walluoft#page/n11/mode/2up ''Darwinism: An Exposition of the Theory of Natural Selection, with Some of Its Applications'']. Macmillan and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heilbron, John L. (2003). ''The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science''. OUP USA. p. 203. {{ISBN|978-0195112290}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Romanes]] dubbed this view as "Wallaceism", noting that in contrast to Darwin, this position was advocating a "pure theory of natural selection to the exclusion of any supplementary theory."&lt;ref&gt;Romanes, John George. (1906). [https://archive.org/stream/darwinafterdarwi02romabost#page/12/mode/2up "Darwin and After Darwin: An Exposition of the Darwinian Theory and a Discussion of Post-Darwinian Questions"].

Harvard University Press. p. 274. {{ISBN|978-0674729698}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking influence from Darwin, Romanes was a proponent of both natural selection and the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]]. The latter was denied by Wallace who was a strict selectionist.&lt;ref&gt;Bolles, R. C; Beecher, M. D. (1987). ''Evolution and Learning''. Psychology Press. p. 45. {{ISBN|978-0898595420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanes' definition of Darwinism conformed directly with Darwin's views and was contrasted with Wallace's definition of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Elsdon-Baker, F. (2008). ''Spirited dispute: the secret split between Wallace and Romanes''. Endeavour 32(2): 75-78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term ''Darwinism'' is often used in the United States by promoters of [[creationism]], notably by leading members of the [[intelligent design movement]], as an epithet to attack evolution as though it were an ideology (an "ism") of [[philosophical naturalism]], or [[atheism]].&lt;ref name="genie"&gt;[[#Petto &amp; Godfrey 2007|Scott 2007]], "Creation Science Lite: 'Intelligent Design' as the New Anti-Evolutionism," p. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100603214827/http://biology.ucf.edu/~clp/Courses/seminar/papers/07-Scott-scientists_confront-cs_lite.pdf 72]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] law professor and author [[Phillip E. Johnson]] makes this accusation of atheism with reference to [[Charles Hodge#Darwinism|Charles Hodge]]'s book ''What Is Darwinism?'' (1874).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/wid.htm |title=What is Darwinism? |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |authorlink=Phillip E. Johnson |date=31 August 1996 |website=[[Access Research Network]] |location=Colorado Springs, CO |accessdate=2007-01-04}} "This paper was originally delivered as a lecture at a symposium at Hillsdale College, in November 1992. Papers from the Symposium were published in the collection ''Man and Creation: Perspectives on Science and Theology'' (Bauman ed. 1993), by Hillsdale College Press, Hillsdale MI 49242."&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike Johnson, Hodge confined the term to exclude those like American botanist [[Asa Gray]] who combined Christian faith with support for Darwin's natural selection theory, before answering the question posed in the book's title by concluding: "It is Atheism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theropps.com/papers/Winter1997/CharlesHodge.htm |title=Charles Hodge and His Objection to Darwinism: The Exclusion of Intelligent Design |last=Ropp |first=Matthew |website=theRopps.com |location=Chesterbrook, PA |accessdate=2007-01-04}} Paper for CH506: American Church History, Dr. Nathan Feldmeth, Winter Quarter 1997, "written while a student in the School of World Mission at [[Fuller Theological Seminary]], Pasadena, California."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodge|1874}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists use the term ''Darwinism'', often pejoratively, to imply that the theory has been held as true only by Darwin and a core group of his followers, whom they cast as [[dogma]]tic and inflexible in their belief.&lt;ref name=morrissullivan&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sullivan |first=Morris |date=Spring 2005 |title=From the Beagle to the School Board: God Goes Back to School |url=http://www.impactpress.com/articles/spring05/sullivanspring05.html |journal=[[Impact Press]] |location=Orlando, FL |publisher=Loudmouth Productions |issue=56 |accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2008 documentary film ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'', which promotes [[intelligent design]] (ID), American writer and actor [[Ben Stein]] refers to scientists as Darwinists. Reviewing the film for ''[[Scientific American]]'', [[John Rennie (editor)|John Rennie]] says "The term is a curious throwback, because in modern biology almost no one relies solely on Darwin's original ideas... Yet the choice of terminology isn't random: Ben Stein wants you to stop thinking of evolution as an actual science supported by verifiable facts and logical arguments and to start thinking of it as a dogmatic, atheistic ideology akin to [[Marxism]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rennie |first=John  |authorlink=John Rennie (editor) |date=9 April 2008 |title=Ben Stein's ''Expelled'': No Integrity Displayed |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ben-steins-expelled-review-john-rennie/ |journal=[[Scientific American]] |location=Stuttgart |publisher=[[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]] |issn=0036-8733 |accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ''Darwinism'' is also used neutrally within the scientific community to distinguish the modern evolutionary synthesis, sometimes called "neo-Darwinism", from those first proposed by Darwin. ''Darwinism'' also is used neutrally by historians to differentiate his theory from other evolutionary theories current around the same period. For example, ''Darwinism'' may be used to refer to Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection, in comparison to more recent mechanisms such as genetic drift and [[gene flow]]. It may also refer specifically to the role of Charles Darwin as opposed to others in the [[history of evolutionary thought]]—particularly contrasting Darwin's results with those of earlier theories such as Lamarckism or later ones such as the modern evolutionary synthesis.

In political discussions in the United States, the term is mostly used by its enemies. "It's a rhetorical device to make evolution seem like a kind of faith, like '[[Maoism]],'" says [[Harvard University]] biologist [[E. O. Wilson]]. He adds, "Scientists don't call it 'Darwinism'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Adler |first=Jerry |date=28 November 2005 |title=Charles Darwin: Evolution of a Scientist |url=http://www.newsweek.com/evolution-scientist-113733 |work=[[Newsweek]] |location=New York |publisher=Newsweek LLC |volume=146 |issue=22 |pages=50–58 |issn=0028-9604 |accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom the term often retains its positive sense as a reference to natural selection, and for example British [[Ethology|ethologist]] and evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote in his collection of essays ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'', published in 2003,  that as a scientist he is a Darwinist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/News/Science-Religion/2003/12/Religion-For-Dummies.aspx |title=Religion: For Dummies |last=Sheahen |first=Laura |website=[[Beliefnet]] |publisher=BN Media, LLC |location=Norfolk, VA |accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1995 book ''[[Darwinian Fairytales]]'', Australian philosopher [[David Stove]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stove|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the term "Darwinism" in a different sense than the above examples. Describing himself as non-religious and as accepting the concept of natural selection as a well-established fact, Stove nonetheless attacked what he described as flawed concepts proposed by some "Ultra-Darwinists." Stove alleged that by using weak or false ''[[ad hoc]]'' reasoning, these Ultra-Darwinists used evolutionary concepts to offer explanations that were not valid (e.g., Stove suggested that [[sociobiology|sociobiological]] explanation of [[altruism]] as an evolutionary feature was presented in such a way that the argument was effectively immune to any criticism). Philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] wrote a rejoinder to Stove,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blackburn |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Blackburn |date=October 1996 |title=I Rather Think I Am a Darwinian |journal=[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]] |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] on behalf of [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]] |volume=71 |number=278 |pages=605–616 |issn=0031-8191 |jstor=3751128 |doi=10.1017/s0031819100053523}}&lt;/ref&gt; though a subsequent essay by Stove's protegee [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franklin |first=James |authorlink=James Franklin (philosopher) |date=January 1997 |title=Stove's Anti-Darwinism |url=http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/stovesantidarwinism.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Philosophy |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press on behalf of Royal Institute of Philosophy |volume=72 |number=279 |pages=133–136 |issn=0031-8191 |jstor=3751309 |doi=10.1017/s0031819100056692}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that Blackburn's response actually "confirms Stove's central thesis that Darwinism can 'explain' anything."

The '''dream argument''' is the postulation that the act of dreaming provides preliminary evidence that the [[sense]]s we trust to distinguish [[reality]] from [[illusion]] should not be fully trusted, and therefore, any state that is dependent on our senses should at the very least be carefully examined and rigorously tested to determine whether it is in fact reality.

== Synopsis ==
{{Descartes}}
While one [[dream]]s, one does not normally [[lucid dreaming|realize]] one is dreaming. This has led [[philosophy|philosophers]] to wonder whether it is possible for one ever to be [[certainty|certain]], at any given point in time, that one is not in fact dreaming, or whether indeed it could be possible for one to remain in a perpetual dream state and never experience the reality of [[wakefulness]] at all.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In the [[Western philosophy|West]], this philosophical puzzle was referred to by [[Plato]] ([[Theaetetus (dialogue)|''Theaetetus'']] 158b-d) and [[Aristotle]] ([[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics'']] 1011a6). Having received serious attention in [[René Descartes]]' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', the dream [[Logical argument|argument]] has become one of the most prominent [[skeptical hypothesis|skeptical hypotheses]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

This type of argument is sometimes referred to as the "[[Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly|Zhuangzi paradox]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;He who dreams of drinking wine may weep when morning comes; he who dreams of weeping may in the morning go off to hunt. While he is dreaming he does not know it is a dream, and in his dream he may even try to interpret a dream. Only after he wakes does he know it was a dream. And someday there will be a great awakening when we know that this is all a great dream. Yet the stupid believe they are awake, busily and brightly assuming they understand things, calling this man ruler, that one herdsman—how dense! Confucius and you are both dreaming! And when I say you are dreaming, I am dreaming, too. Words like these will be labeled the Supreme Swindle. Yet, after ten thousand generations, a great sage may appear who will know their meaning, and it will still be as though he appeared with astonishing speed.&lt;ref&gt;莊子, 齊物論, 12. ''Zhuàngzi'', "Discussion on making all things equal," 12. ''from'' Zhuàngzi, Burton Watson trans., ''Chuang Tzu'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1996), 43. {{ISBN|978-0-231-10595-8}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=f1BvUUUVRLEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the first philosophers to posit the dream argument formally was the [[Yogachara]] philosopher [[Vasubandhu]] (4th to 5th century C.E.) in his "[[Twenty verses on appearance only]]." 

The dream argument came to feature prominently in [[Mahayana]] and [[Tibetan Buddhist]] philosophy. Some [[reality in Buddhism|schools of thought ]] (''e.g.'', [[Dzogchen]]) consider ''perceived [[reality]]'' to be literally unreal. As [[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] puts it: "In a real sense, all the visions that we see in our lifetime are like a big dream . . . ."&lt;ref name="ChNN_dream_yoga_book"&gt;[[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] ''Dream Yoga And The Practice Of Natural Light'' Edited and introduced by Michael Katz, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY, {{ISBN|1-55939-007-7}}, pp. 42, 46, 48, 96, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the term 'visions' denotes not only [[visual perception]]s, but also appearances perceived through all [[sense]]s, including [[hearing|sounds]], [[Odour|smell]]s, [[taste]]s, and [[touch|tactile sensations]], and [[mental operations|operations]] on perceived mental objects.

== Hutton's paradox ==

A paradox concerning dreams and the nature of reality was described by the British writer Eric Bond Hutton in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;"Adversaria V," ''Write Justified'', Spring 1989. For Hutton's definitive statement on the subject see "Hutton's Paradox," ''Fortean Times'', April 2015, archived online [https://archive.org/stream/Fortean_Times_April_2015_UK#page/n71/mode/2up here].&lt;/ref&gt; As a child Hutton often had [[lucid dream|lucid dreams]], in which everything seemed as real as in waking life. This led him to wonder whether life itself was a dream, even whether he existed only in somebody else's dream. Sometimes he had [[pre-lucid dream|pre-lucid dreams]], in which more often than not he concluded he was awake. Such dreams disturbed him greatly, but one day he came up with a magic formula for use in them: "If I find myself asking 'Am I dreaming?' it proves I am, for the question would never occur to me in waking life." Yet, such is the nature of dreams, he could never recall it when he needed to. Many years later, when he wrote a piece about solipsism and his childhood interest in dreams, he was struck by a contradiction in his earlier reasoning. True, asking oneself "Am I dreaming?" ''in a dream'' would seem to prove one is. Yet that is precisely what he had often asked himself in waking life. Therein lay a paradox. What was he to conclude? That it does not prove one is dreaming? Or that life really is a dream?

== Simulated reality ==
{{See also|Simulated reality|Simulation hypothesis}}

Dreaming provides a springboard for those who question whether our own reality may be an illusion. The ability of the mind to be tricked into believing a mentally generated world is the "real world" means at least one variety of simulated reality is a common, even nightly event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=bttg3B5CZOIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=dreaming+simulated+reality&amp;ots=iPQG-evOVr&amp;sig=_7NT_42ES4XXK8iXz02Necg5W9c#PPA103,M1 ''Joseph Barbera, Henry Moller'', Dreaming, Virtual Reality, and Presence].&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who argue that the world is not simulated must concede that the mind—at least the sleeping mind—is not itself an entirely reliable mechanism for attempting to differentiate reality from illusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WD0-45MGTWX-N&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=23fdaaef820b1ccd4be0982568286789 ''Giuliana A. L. Mazzoni and Elizabeth F. Loftus'', When Dreams Become Reality].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote| Whatever I have accepted until now as most true has come to me through my senses. But occasionally I have found that they have deceived me, and it is unwise to trust completely those who have deceived us even once.|||René Descartes&lt;ref&gt;René Descartes, [http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdfbits/dm1.pdf Meditations on First Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Critical discussion ==
In the past, philosophers [[John Locke]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] have separately attempted to refute Descartes's account of the dream argument. Locke claimed that you cannot experience pain in dreams. Various scientific studies conducted within the last few decades provided evidence against Locke's claim by concluding that pain in dreams can occur but the pain isn't as severe{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Philosopher Ben Springett has said that Locke might respond to this by stating that the agonising pain of stepping in to a fire is non-comparable to stepping in to a fire in a dream. Hobbes claimed that dreams are susceptible to absurdity while the waking life is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/dreaming/#SH1b|title=Dreaming, Philosophy of – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|work=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contemporary philosophers have attempted to refute dream skepticism in detail (see, e.g., Stone (1984)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stone, Jim|year=1984|title=Dreaming and Certainty|journal=Philosophical Studies|volume=45|issue=3|pages=353–368|doi=10.1007/BF00355443|url=http://philpapers.org/archive/STODAC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernest Sosa]] (2007) devoted a chapter of a monograph to the topic, in which he presented a new theory of dreaming and argued that his theory raises a new argument for skepticism, which he attempted to refute. In ''A Virtue Epistemology: Apt Belief and Reflective Knowledge'', he states: "in dreaming we do not really believe; we only make-believe."&lt;ref&gt;Sosa, Ernest (2007). A Virtue Epistemology: Apt Belief and Reflective Knowledge. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-929702-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jonathan Ichikawa (2008) and Nathan Ballantyne &amp; Ian Evans (2010) have offered critiques of Sosa's proposed solution. Ichikawa argued that as we cannot tell whether our beliefs in waking life are truly beliefs and not imaginings, like in a dream, we are still not able to tell whether we are awake or dreaming.

[[Norman Malcolm]] in his monograph "Dreaming" (published in 1959) elaborated on Wittgenstein's question as to whether it really mattered if people who tell dreams "really had these images while they slept, or whether it merely seems so to them on waking".  He argues that the sentence "I am asleep" is a senseless form of words; that dreams cannot exist independently of the waking impression; and that scepticism based on dreaming "comes from confusing the historical and dream telling senses...[of]...the past tense". (page 120).  In the chapter: "Do I Know I Am Awake ?" he argues that we do not have to say: "I know that I am awake" simply because it would be absurd to deny that one is awake.

The dream hypothesis is also used to develop other philosophical concepts, such as Valberg's [[personal horizon]]: what this world would be internal to if ''this'' were all a dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valberg|first=J.J.|title=Dream, Death, and the Self|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691128597|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8416.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3791">'''EdgeRank''' is the name commonly given to the [[algorithm]] that [[Facebook]] uses to determine what articles should be displayed in a user's [[News Feed (Facebook)|News Feed]]. As of 2011, Facebook has stopped using the EdgeRank system and uses a [[machine learning]] algorithm that, as of 2013, takes more than 100,000 factors into account.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last=McGee|first=Matt|title=EdgeRank Is Dead: Facebook’s News Feed Algorithm Now Has Close To 100K Weight Factors|url=http://marketingland.com/edgerank-is-dead-facebooks-news-feed-algorithm-now-has-close-to-100k-weight-factors-55908|accessdate=28 May 2014|date=Aug 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EdgeRank was developed and implemented by [[Serkan Piantino]].

== Formula and factors ==
In 2010, a simplified version of the EdgeRank algorithm was presented as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\mathrm{edges\,}e} u_e w_e d_e&lt;/math&gt;
where:
: &lt;math&gt;u_e&lt;/math&gt; is user affinity.
: &lt;math&gt;w_e&lt;/math&gt; is how the content is weighted.
: &lt;math&gt;d_e&lt;/math&gt; is a time-based decay parameter.

* User Affinity: The User Affinity part of the algorithm in Facebook's [http://www.paulramondo.com/facebook-edgerank EdgeRank] looks at the relationship and proximity of the user and the content (post/status update).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Content Weight: What action was taken by the user on the content.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Time-Based Decay Parameter: New or old. Newer posts tend to hold a higher place than older posts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some of the methods that Facebook uses to adjust the parameters are proprietary and not available to the public.&lt;ref name="techcrunch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/22/facebook-edgerank/ |title=EdgeRank: The Secret Sauce That Makes Facebook's News Feed Tick |publisher=techcrunch.com |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==

EdgeRank and its successors have a broad impact on what users actually see out of what they ostensibly follow: for instance, the selection can produce a [[filter bubble]] (if users are exposed to updates which confirm their opinions etc.) or alter people's mood (if users are shown a disproportionate amount of positive or negative updates).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Dominic|last1=Rushe|title=Facebook sorry – almost – for secret psychological experiment on users|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/02/facebook-sorry-secret-psychological-experiment-users|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2014-10-02|issn=0261-3077|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, for Facebook pages, the typical [[engagement rate]] is less than 1 % (or less than 0.1 % for the bigger ones)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2016-12-17|title=What is a good Facebook engagement rate? See numbers here|url=http://www.michaelleander.me/blog/facebook-engagement-rate-benchmark/|website=www.michaelleander.me}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[organic reach]] 10 % or less for most non-profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2016-12-17|title=The 2016 Social Media Director’s Guide to Benchmarks &amp;#124; M+R|url=http://www.mrss.com/lab/the-2016-social-media-directors-guide-to-benchmarks/|website=www.mrss.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, for pages it may be nearly impossible to reach any significant audience without paying to promote their content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2016-12-17|title=Facebook Organic Reach Is DEAD (Here's What You Can Do About It)|url=http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2016/09/facebook-organic-reach-is-dead-heres-what-you-can-do-about-it.html|website=hypebot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electronic tagging''' is a form of [[surveillance]] which uses an electronic device, fitted to the person. For example, an [[ankle monitor]] is used for people who have been sentenced to electronic monitoring by a court, or are required to wear a tag upon release from prison. It is also used in healthcare settings with people with dementia and in immigration contexts in some jurisdictions. If the device is based on [[Global Positioning System|GPS technology]], it is usually attached to a person by a probation officer, [[law enforcement]] or a private monitoring services company field officer, and is capable of tracking the wearer's location wherever there is the satellite signal to do so. Electronic monitoring tags can be also used in combination with curfews to confine defendants or offenders to their home as a condition of bail, as a stand-alone order or as a form of early release from prison. The combination of electronic monitoring with a curfew usually relies on [[radio frequency]] (RF) technology, which differs from GPS technology.

==Background==

===Conceptual history===
The use of home detention as a means of confinement and control within the home can be traced back to biblical times when the Romans placed [[Paul the Apostle]], under house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibbs |first1=Anita |last2=King |first2=Denise |year=2003 |title=The electronic ball and chain? The operation and impact of home detention with electronic monitoring in New Zealand |journal=[[Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Criminology]] |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=1–17 |doi=10.1375/acri.36.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Presidio-modelo2.JPG|thumb|Panopticon: Presidio Modelo prison, inside one of the buildings, 2005]]
In the 18th century, the English philosopher and social theorist [[Jeremy Bentham]] designed the [[Panopticon]], a hypothetical prison.&lt;ref name="Wood 2010"&gt;Wood (2010){{citation needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the Panopticon (the name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "all-seeing"), the prisoners are arranged in a ring of cells surrounding their guard, who is concealed in a tower in the center. The idea is that the guard controls the prisoners through his presumed observation: they constantly imagine his eyes on them, even when he's looking elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Wood 2010"/&gt;

{{Quotation|"[T]he persons to be inspected should always feel themselves as if under inspection ... for the greatest proportion of time possible, each man should actually be under inspection."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bentham, The Panopticon Writings 41 (Miran Bozovic ed., 1995) (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Bentham promoted the concept of the Panopticon for much the same reasons that spur [[criminal]]-[[justice]] innovation today{{when|date=June 2017}}—a ballooning prison population and the need for a cheap solution with light manpower demands. when the modern prison emerged,{{when|date=June 2017}} it, too, was promoted as a reform, a positive replacement for corporal or [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name="Wood 2010"/&gt;

Early prison reformers—many of them [[Quakers]] bent on repentance and redemption— had suggested that cutting people off from the rest of the world would bring them closer to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schenwar|first1=Maya|title=The Quiet Horrors of House Arrest, Electronic Monitoring, and Other Alternative Forms of Incarceration|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/01/house-arrest-surveillance-state-prisons|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The word "penitentiary" comes, of course, from "penitence.") Whereas the guard in Bentham's day had only two eyes, today's watcher can be virtually all-seeing, thanks to [[GPS]] monitoring technology.&lt;ref name="Wood 2010"/&gt;

=== Development ===
In 1964, Ralph Kirkland Schwitzgebel (family name later shortened to "Gable") headed a research team at the Science Committee on Psychological Experimentation at [[Harvard]] University. The technologies of electronic monitoring have their roots in his (1968) experiments with prototype electronic monitoring devices. Schwitzgebel and William S. Hurd were granted patent #3,478,344 and published an article informing how such monitoring devices could be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gable|first1=Ralph K.|last2=Gable|first2=Robert S.|title=Electronic Monitoring: Positive Intervention Strategies|journal=Federal Probation|date=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He developed a one-kilogram Radio Telemetry Device that could be worn by a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Black|Smith|2003|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device transmitted signals to a modified missile-tracking unit up to 400 metres away, which determined the wearer's location on a screen.&lt;ref name="Black_Smith"&gt;{{harvp|Black|Smith|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harvard researchers invented and assessed a prototype monitoring system to use upon juvenile offenders.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Gable, Left to Their Own Devices: Should Manufacturers of Offender Monitoring Equipment be Liable for Design Deject?, 2009 U. ILL. J.L. TECH. &amp; POLY 333, 335&lt;/ref&gt; The public responded unfavorably on the whole, fearing that the devices were overly intrusive.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Even in 1966 it was noted that, in theory, the system could be modified to gather and transmit physiological data such as pulse rates, blood alcohol levels, brain waves, or information on other bodily functions of the wearer and, conversely, that information or stimulation could be sent back to the person wearing the transmitting device. It could also be easily adapted to serve as a listening device or two-way radio. The system was tested on volunteers who included students, parolees and mental patients, and experiments along these lines exploring its possibilities were conducted. in 1969 Schwitzgebel was granted a patent in relation to the system.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 1978, in diversion from its criminal justice application, a company called BI Incorporated began selling systems that allowed dairy farmers to dispense feed to their cows automatically. The company fitted a [[radio-frequency]] tag on each cow's ear so that when the cow approached the feed dispenser, a sensor in the latter caused it to drop a ration of fodder. If the same cow returned, the sensor recognized the unique signal of the tag and prevented the cow from getting a second helping until after enough time had passed for her to digest the first.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 1981, writer [[Tom Stacey]] took to the British [[Home Office]] a proposal for the electronic tagging of offenders to track their movements, or fix a home curfew, using cellular radio telephone technology. Stacey had been briefly imprisoned abroad in his former role as a foreign correspondent and had for several years served as a "Prison Visitor" in England. In a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' on 6 October 1982 he outlined the proposal and immediate founded the ''Offender's Tag Association'', composed of electronic scientists, [[penologist]]s and prominent citizens. The term 'tagging' thus entered the British English vocabulary in the penal context.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} 
In March 1983, the ''Offender's Tag Association'' held a national press conference.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Later in 1983, a district court judge in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], Jack Love, persuaded Michael Goss, a computer salesperson, to develop a system to monitor five offenders. He sentenced offenders in what is considered the first court-sanctioned use of electronic monitoring at home.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Judge Love was supposedly inspired to act based upon a storyline in a ''[[Spider-Man]]'' comic, specifically the [[The Amazing Spider-Man|newspaper comic strip version]] where the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] puts an electronic bracelet on the superhero primarily to follow his movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/qitranscripts/408.htm QI Transcript, Season 4 Episode 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012153155/http://freewebs.com/qitranscripts/408.htm |date=12 October 2007 }} [[QI]], Transcript on qitranscripts.com; Broadcast 2006; Accessed 25 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the widespread adoption of [[cellular network|cellular]] and [[broadband]] Internet networks in the US in the mid-1990s, electronic monitoring devices were typically home-based, dependent on a dedicated land line, and able to report only whether or not the criminal being tracked, was remaining at home. This was useful for criminals on work-release, [[parole]], or [[probation]], for example [[DWI]] offenders who were allowed to leave home to go to work during daytime hours but had to return home and remain there after a certain time of the evening.

Since the mid-1990s, more recent technology such as GPS and cellular networks have permitted courts to order more specific restrictions, such as permitting a registered child sex offender to leave his home at any time of day, but alerting authorities if they come within 100 metres of a school, park, or playground.

== How it works ==

=== Big picture ===
[[Trilateration]] is the process of determining absolute or relative locations of points by measurement of distances, using the geometry of [[circle]]s, [[sphere]]s or [[triangle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/605329/trilateration Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2-Dimension trilateration ====
If someone in the [[United States]] completely lost track of where he last was, asked directions in a nearby town and a local tells that he was 625 miles from [[Boise]], [[Idaho]], he could be anywhere on a circle around Boise that has a radius of 625 miles. If he then asked another person and was told that he was 690 miles from [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], he could combine this with the Boise information in two circles that intersect. He would know that he was at one of the two intersection points. If a third person told him that he was 615 miles from [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]], he could then eliminate the other options, because the third circle would only intersect with one of these points. The same concept works in three-dimensional space, as well, where there is only spheres instead of circles.
&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brian|first1=Marshall|last2=Harris|first2=Tom|title=How GPS Receivers Work|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/travel/gps.htm|publisher=How Stuff Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 3-Dimension trilateration ====
[[File:Navstar-2F.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Artist's impression of a Navstar-2F satellite in orbit.]]

If someone knows he is 10 miles from satellite A in the sky, he could be anywhere on the surface of a huge, imaginary sphere with a 10-mile radius. If he also knows he is 15 miles from satellite B, he could overlap the first sphere with another, larger sphere. If he then also knows the distance to a third satellite, he could get a third sphere, which intersects with this circle at two points.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

The Earth itself can act as a fourth sphere—only one of the two possible points will actually be on the surface of the planet, so one can eliminate the sphere in space. The GPS receiver figures both of these things out by analyzing high-frequency, low-power radio signals from the GPS satellites.

Radio waves are [[electromagnetic]] energy, which means they travel at the speed of light (about 186,000 miles per second, 300,000&amp;nbsp;km per second in a vacuum). The receiver can figure out how far the signal has traveled by timing how long it took the signal to arrive.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

The correct time value will cause all of the signals that the receiver is receiving to align at a single point in space. So the receiver sets its clock to that time value, and it then has the same time value that all the atomic clocks in all of the satellites have. When you measure the distance to four located satellites, you can draw four spheres that all intersect at one point. Three spheres will intersect even if your numbers are way off, but four spheres will not intersect at one point if you've measured incorrectly. The receiver does this constantly whenever it's on, which means it is nearly as accurate as the expensive atomic clocks in the satellites.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

In order for the distance information to be of any use, the receiver also has to know where the satellites actually are. Things like the pull of the moon and the sun do change the satellites' orbits very slightly, but the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] constantly monitors their exact positions and transmits any adjustments to all GPS receivers as part of the satellites' signals.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

For one thing, this method assumes the radio signals will make their way through the atmosphere at a consistent speed, the speed of light. Problems can also occur when radio signals bounce off large objects, such as skyscrapers, giving a receiver the impression that a satellite is farther away than it actually is. The station then broadcasts a radio signal to all DGPS-equipped receivers in the area, providing signal correction information for that area.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

The most essential function of a GPS receiver is to pick up the transmissions of at least four satellites and combine the information in those transmissions with information in an electronic almanac, all in order to figure out the receiver's position on Earth.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

Once the receiver makes this calculation, it can compute the latitude, longitude and altitude (or some similar measurement) of its current position.
One can use maps stored in the receiver's memory, connect the receiver to a computer, which can hold more detailed maps in its memory, or one can on a detailed map of an area find one´s way using the receiver's latitude and longitude readouts. A standard GPS receiver will not only place one´s position on a map at any particular location, but also trace one´s path across a map as one moves. If the receiver is switched on, it can stay in constant communication with GPS satellites to see how one´s location is changing.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

===Small picture===
The portable device is operatively coupled to a monitoring system through a wireless telephone network. The portable device transmits periodically encrypted location information as well as status information across the wireless network to the monitoring system. The monitoring system tracks the location of the individual and alerts the appropriate authorities when the individual violates a rule, such as a condition for parole. The portable device increases the time between transmissions when the individual is within a specified home location and reduces the time between transmissions when outside the specified location.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

As a fail-safe against any technological glitch, whether accidental or malicious, a leading Electronic Monitoring operator is immensely proud of its backup systems, which boast an ultra-secure data room and extreme redundancy: For example, if a toxic-gas cloud were to wipe out the town of Anderson, the last act of the staff there would be to flip the switches diverting all call traffic to BI's corporate office in Boulder, Colorado, where a team capable of taking over instantly in case of disaster is always on duty.&lt;ref name="Wood 2010"/&gt;

== Other designs ==

=== Medical and health use ===
The use of electronic monitoring in medical practice, especially as it relates to the tagging of the elderly and people with [[dementia]], is capable of generating controversy, and media attention.&lt;ref name="BBC_Alzheimers"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title=Electronic tagging for Alzheimer's |date=27 September 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2284537.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elderly people in care homes can be tagged with the same electronic monitors used to keep track of young offenders. For persons suffering from dementia, electronic monitoring might be beneficially used to prevent them from wandering away.&lt;ref name="BBC_Alzheimers"/&gt; The controversy in its medical use relates to two arguments, one as to the safety of the patients, and the other, as to their privacy and human rights.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Louw 2002"&gt;Julian C Hughes and Stephen J Louw, ‘Electronic Tagging of People with Dementia who Wander: Ethical Considerations are Possibly more Important than Practical Benefits' (2002) 325(7369) British Medical Journal 847﹘848 &lt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1124366/ PubMed]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At over 40%, there is a high prevalence of wandering amongst patients with dementia. Of the several methods deployed to keep them from wandering, it is reported that 44% of wanderers with dementia have been kept behind closed doors at some point.&lt;ref&gt;McShane R et al, ‘Getting Lost in Dementia: A Longitudinal Study of a Behavioral Symptom' (1998) 5 International Psychogeriatrics 239﹘245&lt;/ref&gt; Other solutions have included constant surveillance, use of makeshift alarms and, the use of various drugs that carry the risk of adverse effects.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Louw 2002"/&gt;

Opinions as to the propriety of electronic tagging of the elderly and persons with dementia vary. Carers welcome the idea of electronic tracking devices so long as it allows wanderers to be found more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;McShane R et al, ‘The Feasibility of Electronic Tracking Devices in Dementia: A Telephone Survey and Case Series' (1998) 13 International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry 556﹘563.&lt;/ref&gt; Some persons argue that a little liberty can be sacrificed in order to achieve safety and any concern about privacy only has force when we imagine that the person involved is trying to hide.&lt;ref&gt;McShane R, Hope T and Wilkinson J, ‘Tracking Patients Who Wander: Ethics and Technology' (1994) 343 Lancet 1274.&lt;/ref&gt; The thinking behind this argument is that, for wandering persons with severe dementia, being electronically tagged and monitored carries less stigma than being found half dressed, in the middle of the night, on a highway.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Louw 2002"/&gt; On the other side of the argument, it is contended that even in mild dementia, the need to protect a patient's right to privacy must be maintained. Even though electronic tagging and monitoring increases liberty, in a sense, it may potentially decrease the autonomy of the patient. Tracking may only settle the anxiety of Carers and family without necessarily attending to the needs of the person with dementia. What is important is to determine if persons with dementia have the capacity to make decisions, and if they do, their decisions should be respected. Where the person lacks the capacity, decisions need to be made in their best interest. Best interest in this sense does not simply mean the person's best medical interest. Deciding on their best interest will require careful inquiry, negotiation, and judgment.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Louw 2002"/&gt;

=== Commercial use ===
On an iPhone, "Location Services" allows location-based apps and websites (including Maps, Camera, Safari, and other Apple and third-party apps) to use information from Global Positioning System (GPS) networks to determine your approximate location.&lt;ref&gt;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202588&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==

The use of ankle bracelets, or other electronic monitoring devices, have proven to be effective in research studies and even deterred crime. As such, they benefit society. When applied early, they may save otherwise habitual offenders from a life of crime.&lt;ref name="Stuart S Yeh, 2010"&gt;Stuart S Yeh,[http://www.antoniocasella.eu/nume/YEH_2010.pdf ‘Cost-benefit analysis of reducing crime through electronic monitoring of parolees and probationers'] (2010) 38 Journal of Criminal Justice 1090﹘1096.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors have been identified as necessary to render electronic monitoring effective: appropriately selecting offenders, robust and appropriate technology, fitting tags promptly, responding to breaches promptly, and communication between the criminal justice system and contractors.The Quaker Council for European Affairs thinks that for electronic monitoring to be effective, it should serve to halt a developing criminal career.&lt;ref name="Quaker Council for European Affairs 2010"&gt;Quaker Council for European Affairs,[http://www.qcea.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/rprt-alternatives-en-jan-2010.pdf ‘Investigating Alternatives to Imprisonment'] (2010) .&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Audit Office in England and Wales commissioned a survey to examine the experiences of electronically monitored offenders and the members of their family. The survey revealed that there was common agreement amongst survey respondents that electronic monitoring was a more effective punitive measure than fines, and that it was generally more effective than community service. An interviewed offender is credited with saying: ‘You learn more about other crimes [in prison] and I think it gives you a taste to do other crimes because you've sat listening to other people'.&lt;ref&gt;National Audit Office, [http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/nao_reports/05-06/0506800.pdf ‘The Electronic Monitoring of Adult Offenders: Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General'] (1 February 2006) Appendix 4, accessed 30 May 2015, .&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Padgett, Bales and Bloomberg study ===

In 2006, Kathy Padgett, William Bales and Thomas Bloomberg conducted a well–controlled, large scale evaluation of 75,661 Florida offenders placed on home detention from 1998 to 2002.,&lt;ref name="Stuart S Yeh, 2010"/&gt; a small percentage of whom were made to wear an electronic monitoring device, which allowed comparison between those who were electronically monitored and those who were not. The study controlled for  factors thought to influence the success or failure of community supervision: the type of placement, type of electronic monitoring device (GPS or radio frequency), criminal history, offender characteristics, type of primary offence committed by each offender, court- ordered conditions of supervision, the number of weeks absconded, weeks in treatment etc. with a total of 62 variables.&lt;ref name="Padgett"&gt;Kathy Padgett, William Bales and Thomas Blomberg, [http://www.antoniocasella.eu/nume/Padgett_electronic_2006.pdf ‘Under Surveillance: An Empirical Test of the Effectiveness and Consequences of Electronic Monitoring'](2006) 5(1) Criminology and Public Policy 61–91 .&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers incorporated time-varying independent variables in the estimation of maximum-likelihood coefficients, and also applied proportional-hazards survival analysis to adjust for right-censoring.&lt;ref name="Padgett"/&gt; As of 2010, compared to other studies, no previous study of electronic monitoring controlled such an array of variables nor involved such a large sample.&lt;ref name="Stuart S Yeh, 2010"/&gt;

Regarding their rate of compliance, violent offenders monitored by GPS were 91.2% less likely to abscond than those offenders not monitored at all.  Electronic monitoring also effectively prevented offenders from committing new offences while being monitored: monitored offenders were 94.7% less likely to commit new offences than unmonitored offenders. The researchers found ‘no clear evidence that, overall, the decision to monitor offenders on home confinement with enhanced electronic control mechanisms results in ‘front-end' [[net-widening]]. In other words, offenders sentenced to home confinement with EM seem to have posed a significantly higher risk to public safety and would have had a higher likelihood of receiving a prison sentence if not for the availability of EM as an enhanced control mechanism.' In the end, GPS monitored offenders are 90.2% less likely than offenders on home confinement without EM to be revoked for a technical violation.&lt;ref name="Padgett"/&gt;

Another major advantage is the fact that wide deployment of electronic monitoring may lead to reduced prison populations. This is most likely where monitoring is used as an alternative to prison, rather than to enhance existing non-custodial orders. Major cost savings may be achieved through building fewer prisons as well as reducing the cost of administering custodial sentences.

Another is the possibility of improving rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders. Electronic monitoring may allow more offenders to maintain employment and contact with their families. It also avoids any negative psychological effects of incarceration, although of course the wearing of a device carries its own psychological pressures.

===GPS jamming===
In late 2009, satellite-positioning receivers for a new navigation system at [[Newark airport]] in New Jersey were suffering brief daily breaks in reception.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Matyszczyk [http://www.cnet.com/au/news/truck-driver-has-gps-jammer-accidentally-jams-newark-airport/ Truck driver has GPS jammer, accidentally jams Newark airport]  Cnet, 12 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Economist|first1=The|title=No Jam Tomorrow|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18304246|accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Something was interfering with the signals from orbiting global positioning system (GPS) satellites. A driver who passed by on the nearby New Jersey Turnpike each day used a cheap GPS jammer in his truck. Jammers prevent tracking devices from determining (and then reporting) its location.

Some truck companies use [[fleet management]] software integrated with GPS in vehicles to monitor whether their drivers ever break speed limits, and in response, some delivery drivers buy illegal GPS jammers to subvert the system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10228874/GPS-jammer-costs-driver-32000-after-interfering-with-plane-signals.html GPS-jammer-costs-driver-32000-after-interfering-with-plane-signals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820114756/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10228874/GPS-jammer-costs-driver-32000-after-interfering-with-plane-signals.html |date=20 August 2014 }} Telegraph Media Group, UK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Collier [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/taxi-driver-fined-over-use-of-illegal-gps-jammer-in-fare-scam/story-fni0fee2-1226799269681 Taxi driver fined over use of illegal GPS jammer in fare scam] HeraldSun, Australia January 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Grubb [http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/mobiles/illegal-mobile-phone-and-gps-jammer-crackdown-by-regulator-yields-results-20130716-2q2oo.html Illegal mobile phone and GPS jammer crackdown by regulator yields results] July 17, 2013, The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
A number of criticisms of the technology exist - some "[[Law and order (politics)|Tough on Crime]]" groups argue that electronic tagging perceived as lenient, while other groups argue that the technology enables [[Net-widening]], where non-prison bound individuals are subject to increased monitoring.

Electronic monitoring does not physically restrain a person and dangerous offenders are still able to offend before authorities can intervene. Home detention with electronic monitoring is perceived by some people as lenient.&lt;ref name="Black_Smith"/&gt;

As early as 1988, the Penal Affairs Committee of the Religious Society of Friends ([[Quakers]]), wrote a briefing in its Green Paper strongly opposing the adoption of electronic monitoring in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Penal Affairs Committee|1988|pp=13–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee noted all the claims made in favour of electronic monitoring but insisted that all such claims could be ‘either demolished or rendered invalid' by arguments against it. The major argument or criticism against it was that on the basis of past experience, electronic monitoring would not absolutely be used on people at risk of custody, but on people who would otherwise have been granted probation or community service. This would lead to a widening of the net of control rather than reducing prison population; it would undermine constructive and supportive interventions. The Penal Committee concluded that the degrading monitoring of fellow human beings, electronically, was morally wrong and unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Penal Affairs Committee|1988|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the system was inherently ‘retributive and punitive' and the wearing of an ankle monitor would be stigmatizing for women offenders.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Nellis, ‘Quakers, Penal Reform and the Challenge of Electronically Monitoring Offenders' (2011) 25 (1–2) International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 95﹘105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US in 1990, Ronald Corbett and Gary T. Marx criticised the use of electronic monitoring in a paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the [[American Society of Criminology]], [[Baltimore]]. In the paper, which was later published in the Justice Quarterly, the authors described ‘the new surveillance' technology as sharing some ethos and the information-gathering techniques found in maximum-security prisons thereby allowing them to diffuse into the broader society. They remarked that ‘we appear to be moving toward, rather than away from, becoming a "maximum-security society."'&lt;ref name="Corbett_Marx"&gt;Ronald Corbett and Gary T. Marx, ‘Critique: No Soul In The New Machine: Technofallacies In The Electronic Monitoring Movement' (1991) 8 (3) Justice Quarterly [http://web.mit.edu/gtmarx/www/critique.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors acknowledged the data-mining capacity of electronic monitoring devices when they stated that ‘data in many different forms, from widely separated geographical areas, organizations, and time periods, can easily be merged and analyzed.'&lt;ref name="Corbett_Marx"/&gt;

In 2013, it was reported that many electronic-monitoring programs throughout the US were not staffed appropriately.&lt;ref name="Osher"&gt;Christopher N Osher, ‘Electronic Monitoring of Colorado Parolees has Pitfalls', [[The Denver Post]] (Online), 6 September 2013 [http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_23420684/electronic-monitoring-colorado-parolees-has-pitfalls &lt;http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_23420684/electronic-monitoring-colorado-parolees-has-pitfalls&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; George Drake, a consultant who worked on improving the systems said ‘Many times when an agency is budgeted for electronic-monitoring equipment, it is only budgeted for the devices themselves.' He added that the situation was ‘like buying a hammer and expecting a house to be built. It's simply a tool, and it requires a professional to use that tool and run the program.' Drake warned that programs can get out of control if officials don't develop stringent protocols for how to respond to alerts and don't manage how alerts are generated: ‘I see agencies with so many alerts that they can't deal with them,' Drake said. ‘They end up just throwing their hands up and saying they can't keep up with them.' In [[Colorado]], a review of alert and event data, obtained from the Colorado Department of Corrections under an open-records request, was conducted by matching the names of parolees who appeared in that data with those who appeared in jail arrest records. The data revealed that 212 parole officers were saddled with the duty of responding to nearly 90,000 alerts and notification generated by electronic monitoring devices in the six months reviewed.&lt;ref name="Osher"/&gt;

According to an analysis in the Journal of Law and Policy, most of those placed on electronic monitors haven't committed serious or violent offenses and, were it not for monitoring, "at least some of these populations would not in fact be incarcerated or otherwise under physical control." Eighty-nine percent of probation officers surveyed by the Justice Department felt that "offenders' relationships with their significant others changed because of being monitored." Both officers and those monitored observed that the ankle band had a distinct impact on children. As one parent testified, "When it beeps, the kids worry about whether the probation officer is coming to take me to jail. The kids run for it when it beeps."

As a condition for her bail, Gabrielle Baillieux, the protagonist in Peter Carey's ''Amnesia'', had to wear an ankle monitor. Later a colleague took it off. The device was transferred to a dog, whose movements were instead tracked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carey|first1=Peter|title=Amnesia|date=2015|publisher=Random House Canada|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Good Wife]]'', ("Bang") season 1 episode 15, Peter had been imprisoned for several months after being convicted of charges of corruption. He is allowed to return home under house arrest while his appeal is considered. Peter must wear an ankle monitor and cannot leave the apartment or communicate with the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bang (The Good Wife)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2007 American mystery horror-thriller movie, [[Disturbia (film)|''Disturbia'']], a 17-year-old high school student, Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf), is charged with aggravated assault after his teacher made a personal remark about his dad, who had died in a car accident, and Kale is sentenced to three months of house arrest. He is secured with an ankle monitor and allowed only 100 feet from his house.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== USA ===

The U.S. correctional system is overwhelmed by the over-incarceration of nonviolent offenders such as drug users. Private-prison corporations themselves have begun to expand into the "alternatives" industry. The GEO Group now has an array of "community reëntry services" and treatment programs.&lt;ref name="Stillman 2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stillman|first1=Sarah|title=Get Out of Jail Inc.|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/23/get-out-of-jail-inc|accessdate=Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, it acquired the country's largest electronic-monitoring firm, BI Incorporated, for $415 million.&lt;ref name="Stillman 2014"/&gt; For the most part, these companies deal not with felony probationers ("probation" as it is usually understood) but with people whose offenses are often too minor to merit jail time. The system is known as "offender-funded" justice.&lt;ref name="Stillman 2014"/&gt;

Jack Long, a Georgia attorney, filed a habeas petition on behalf of a client who, after stealing a two-dollar can of beer from a convenience store, was ordered to spend a year wearing an ankle bracelet operated by a company called [[Sentinel Offender Services]].&lt;ref name="Stillman 2014"/&gt; The man wound up owing more than a thousand dollars to the company in fees and late-payment penalties, and started selling his blood plasma to keep pace. Dozens of probationers are jailed because of electronic-monitoring bills, most of which were not authorized by any legal statute.&lt;ref name="Stillman 2014"/&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===

Electronic monitoring of a curfew has become an integral part of the criminal justice system in the [[United Kingdom]], used at various stages of criminal cases used to monitor compliance with a curfew, requiring the curfewee to remain in their home for a specified number of hours a day or exclusion from specified areas (such as victim's homes and football grounds).

Those subject to electronic monitoring may be given curfews as part of [[Bail]] conditions, sentenced under the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] in England and Wales (with separate legislation applying in Scotland). Alternatively offenders may be released from a prison on a [[Home Detention Curfew]]. Released prisoners under home detention allowed out during curfew hours only for:
#A wedding or funeral (service only) of a close relative
#A job interview
#Acting as a witness in court
#Emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offendersfamilieshelpline.org/index.php/hdc/ Home Detention Curfew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, electronic monitoring may be used for those subject to a curfew given under the [[Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011]] (previously known as [[Control order]] under the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24803069&lt;/ref&gt;)

Since electronically monitored curfews were rolled out throughout England and Wales their use has increased sharply, from 9,000 cases in 1999-2000 to 53,000 in 2004-05. In 2004-05, the Home Office spent £102.3 million on the electronic monitoring of curfews and electronically monitored curfews are considered cheaper than custody.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nao.org.uk/report/the-electronic-monitoring-of-adult-offenders/&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety days in [[Detention (imprisonment)|custody]] (e.g., a prison) costs approximately five times more than the same amount of time on an electronically monitored curfew order.

Typically, offenders are fitted with an electronic tag around their ankle which sends a regular signal to a receiver unit installed in their home. Some systems are connected to a [[landline|fixed telephone line]] in the case where a [[GSM|GSM signal]] is not available, whilst most arrangements utilise the mobile phone system to communicate with the monitoring company. If the tag is not functioning or within range of the base station during curfew hours, or if the base is disconnected from the power supply, or the base station is moved then the monitoring company are alerted, who in turn, notify the appropriate authority such as the [[Police|Law enforcement in the United Kingdom]], [[National Probation Service]] or [[Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.le.ac.uk/oerresources/criminology/msc/unit8/page_21.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Policy Exchange thinktank examined the use of electronic monitoring in England and Wales and made comparisons with technologies and models seen in other jurisdictions, particularly the United States. The report was critical of the Ministry of Justice's model of a fully privatised service - which gave little scope for police or probation services to make use of electronic monitoring. The report, Future of Corrections, also criticised the cost of the service, highlighting an apparent differential between what the UK taxpayer was charged and what could be found in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Future-Corrections-Exploring-Electronic-Monitoring/dp/1907689273|title=Future of Corrections: Exploring the Use of Electronic Monitoring|last=Geoghegan|first=Rory|last2=Miller|first2=Chris|date=2012-10-01|publisher=Policy Exchange|isbn=9781907689277}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of publication the Ministry of Justice was completing a procurement exercise for a new generation of GPS tags - and the report described the exercise as flawed, calling on electronic monitoring to be commissioned locally via Police and Crime Commissioners.

Subsequently, there were a number of scandals in relation to electronic monitoring in England and Wales, with a criminal investigation opened by the Serious Fraud Office into the activities of Serco and G4S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfo.gov.uk/2013/11/04/g4s-serco-investigation-2/|title=G4S and Serco investigation|date=2013-11-04|website=Serious Fraud Office|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the investigation, Serco agreed to repay £68.5 million to the taxpayer and G4S agreed to repay £109 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/news/2015/06/25/moj-paid-g4s-serco-millions-for-electronic-tagging-during-fr|title=MoJ paid G4S &amp; Serco millions for electronic tagging during fraud investigation|last=Dunt|first=Ian|newspaper=politics.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duopoly were subsequently stripped of their contract, with Capita taking over the contract. In 2017, another criminal investigation saw police make a number of arrests in relation to allegations that at least 32 criminals on tag had paid up to £400 to Capita employees in order to have 'loose' tags fitted, allowing them to remove their tags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/arrests-after-criminals-paid-163400-to-get-loose-electronic-tags-10755416|title=Criminals 'paid £400' for loose electronic tags|newspaper=Sky News|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monitoring of sex offenders via electronic tagging is currently in debate due to certain rights offenders have in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/aug/12/larry-murphy-electronic-tagging Electronic tagging of offenders raises rights concerns], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 12 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic tagging has begun being used on psychiatric patients, prompting concern from mental health advocates who state that the practice is demeaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackmentalhealth.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=789&amp;Itemid=117 GPS tracking mental health patients - human rights concerns], BMH UK, 22 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scotland]], those convicted of a serious sexual or violent crime, and are determined to pose a serious danger to the community, are to be given a sentence, known as an [[Order for Lifelong Restriction]], which means that the offender will be detained indefinitely, until the [[Parole Board for Scotland]] determines that the offender no longer poses a risk to the safety of others. If the offender is released on [[parole]], he or she is to be electronically tagged and kept under close supervision by the Scottish Parole Board for the remainder of the offender's life.

=== Australia ===

==== Pre-trial ====
In [[Western Australia]], The Bail Act 1982 (WA) specifically provides for electronic monitoring at the pre-trial stage. The Act allows only judicial officers to impose a home detention. This is done after first obtaining a suitability report, from a corrections officer, on accused persons aged over 17. The accused person may then be required to wear a device or permit the installation of a device in the place where he/she is required to remain.

In most Australian jurisdictions, the generally broad discretion available when imposing bail conditions may permit electronic monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Nacro Youth Crime 2002, "Electronic monitoring of children remanded on bail or to local authority accommodation", Youth Crime Briefing, June&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in section 11(2) of the South Australian Bail Act 1985, the bail authority may 'impose a condition requiring an accused person to remain at his or her residence except for authorised activities such as employment.'&lt;ref name="Black_Smith"/&gt; The Supreme Court of South Australia, it is thought,&lt;ref name="Black_Smith"/&gt; may have interpreted this as authority to order electronically monitored bail, at least where the applicant is willing.&lt;ref&gt;R v Blayney [2002] SASC 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Primary sentencing ====
The [[Northern Territory]] and Western Australia have laws that specifically authorize electronic monitoring as a primary sentencing option for home detention. The ''Sentencing Act 1995'', of the Northern Territory, provides that a 'court which sentences an offender to a term of imprisonment may make an order suspending the sentence on the offender entering into a home detention order'. Such offenders may be required to 'wear or have attached an approved monitoring device in accordance with the directions of the Commissioner, and allow the placing, or installation in, and retrieval from, the premises or place specified in the order of such machine, equipment or device necessary for the efficient operation of the monitoring device'.&lt;ref&gt;Section 44 (3) (b), ''Sentencing Act 1995'' (NT).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western Australia, the ''Sentencing Act 1995'' provides that a court may impose an intensive supervision order with a curfew requirement. The offender is required to submit to surveillance or monitoring as ordered;&lt;ref&gt;Section 75 (1) (b) ''Sentencing Act 1995'' (WA)&lt;/ref&gt; wear a device or have a device installed in his or her home.&lt;ref&gt;Section 75 (10) (a) &amp; (b) ''Sentencing Act 1995'' (WA)&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic monitoring 'may only be imposed for a term of six months or less'.

In [[New South Wales]], although the law does not specifically authorise electronic monitoring, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), however, grants the court the power to 'impose such conditions as it considers appropriate on any home detention order made by it'.&lt;ref&gt;Section 82 (1), ''Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999'' (NSW)&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, electronic monitoring is used to enforce these home detention orders.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, N. 2000, "Home detention: An alternative to prison?" Current Issues in Criminal Justice, vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 98-105.&lt;/ref&gt; The general powers of court may also allow electronic monitoring in other States and Territories.&lt;ref name="Black_Smith"/&gt;

=== Brazil ===
In August 2010, Brazil awarded a GPS Offender Monitoring contract to kick start its monitoring of offenders and management of the Brazilian governments early release programme&lt;ref&gt;[http://latinamerica.tmcnet.com/topics/brazil/articles/96256-securealert-signs-first-ever-gps-offender-monitoring-contract.htm SecureAlert Signs First-Ever GPS Offender Monitoring Contract in Brazil], TMCnet, 23 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
Electronic monitoring as a pilot project was started in March 2012, involving 150 offenders, mostly prisoners serving life terms. The project was rolled out to reduce the South Africa's prison population. It consequently would also reduce the taxpayer's burden on correctional facilities.&lt;ref name="DCS"&gt;Dept. of Correctional services: Rep of South Africa, South Africa's first ever Electronic of a Remand Detainee, 15/04/2014.&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa locks up more people than any other country on the continent.&lt;ref name="DCS"/&gt;

'''Elizabeth Bender Roe Cloud''' (April 2, 1887 – September 16, 1965) was an [[Ojibwe]] activist and educator. A product of the Native American Boarding School System, she graduated with teaching credentials from the [[Hampton Institute]] and taught from 1908 though 1916. She then joined her husband and helped administer the American Indian Institute of Wichita, Kansas for twenty-five years. In the 1940s, she founded the Oregon Trails Women's Club with tribe members from the [[Umatilla Indian Reservation]]. She served as the National Chair of Indian Welfare for the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]] for eight years, the first American Indian to hold the post. Roe Cloud received the National Mother of the Year award in 1950 and in 1952, she was honored as the "Outstanding Indian" of the year by the [[American Indian Exposition]] of [[Anadarko, Oklahoma]]. She is noted for having used her influence as an educated indigenous woman to advocate for Native American self-determination.

==Early life==
Elizabeth Georgiana Bender (native name: Equay Zaince){{#tag:ref|Elizabeth Roe Cloud's allotment number was 556, as shown on the 1930 Chippewa Census.{{sfn|Chippewa Census|1930|p=562}} This allotment number is identical with that assigned to Equay Zaince on the Minnesota Historical Society Records.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|2011|p=12}}|group="Notes"}} was born on April 2, 1887{{#tag:ref|Tetzloff gives Bender's birth date April 2, 1887.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=80}} This conflicts with the date of July 1888 shown on the 1900 census;{{sfn|U. S. Census|1900|p=5B}} but all of the dates on the 1900 census for the Bender siblings do not conform to other published dates. For example, Anna's birth date in Molin is given as February 22, 1885{{sfn|Molin|1988|p=94}} and Chief's birth date in Kashatus is given as May 5, 1884.{{sfn|Kashatus|2006|p=5}}|group="Notes"}}  on the [[White Earth Indian Reservation]] in northwestern [[Minnesota]] to Pay show de o quay (Mary née Razor or Razier), of the Mississippi Chippewa band and Albertus Bliss Bender, a German immigrant.{{sfn|U.

One of eleven children born to the couple, Elizabeth was the sixth child{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=80}} and one of five who attended Hampton Institute.{{sfn|Molin|1988|p=94}} Her older sister Anna was also an educator and two of her older brothers John and [[Chief Bender|Charles Albert "Chief" Bender]] were noted baseball players. Chief was inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1953.{{sfn|Swift|2008|p=165}}{{sfn|Kashatus|2006|p=150}}

Bender attended boarding schools in Minnesota, beginning her studies at around age nine at the Catholic Sisters School in [[St. Joseph, Minnesota]]. After her first year, she transferred to the Catholic Sisters School closer to home, in [[White Earth, Minnesota|White Earth]], for another year. Between 1898 and 1902,{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=81}} she took courses at the [[American Indian boarding schools|Pipestone Boarding School]] for half a day and then performed manual labor for the other half-day.{{sfn|Molin|1988|p=95}} She went on to join her sister Anna and further her education at the [[normal school]] of the Hampton Institute in 1903.{{sfn|Gridley|1936|p=34}}{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=93}} Both she and her sister Anna participated in the work-away summer programs, where they were paid for performing domestic services. In 1904, they were placed in separate houses near Boston, which allowed them to spend time together, as well as making a trip to watch their brother Chief play baseball.{{sfn|Molin|1988|p=97}} Completing her studies in 1907, she remained at Hampton taking post-graduate courses in teaching and domestic science.{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=93}}{{sfn|Nesper|2014}}{{sfn|Molin|1988|p=97}}

==Career==
In 1908, Bender was sent to the [[Blackfeet Reservation]] in [[Browning, Montana]], where she would teach for two years. In 1910, she returned east and completed a nursing course in [[Philadelphia]] at [[Hahnemann University Hospital|Hahnemann Hospital]]. In 1912, she returned to the Blackfeet Reservation. The following year,{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|pp=84–85}} she moved on to the school at the [[Fort Belknap Indian Reservation]] in Montana, where she remained until 1914.{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=94}}{{sfn|''The Red Lake News''|1915|p=2}} At both of the reservations, she not only taught, but served as housemother to the boarders, occasionally as their cook, and even treated the students for [[trachoma]].{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=94}} She returned to Hampton to complete a [[Home Economics]] course in 1914 and 1915.{{sfn|Nesper|2014}}{{sfn|''The Red Lake News''|1915|p=2}} During this same time frame, she attended the Fourth Annual Conference of the [[Society of American Indians]] held between October 6 and 11, 1914 in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=93}} Bender had joined the organization when she graduated{{sfn|Nesper|2014}} and it was at this meeting that she would meet [[Henry Roe Cloud]], a full-blood [[Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska|Winnebago]] tribe member.{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=93}} The two immediately began a relationship, which continued even after Bender finished her studies at Hampton and went to teach at [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in 1915.{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=95}} Simultaneously, Roe Cloud went to [[Wichita, Kansas]] and founded the Roe Institute, later known as the American Indian Institute,{{sfn|''The Wichita Beacon''|1921|p=12}}{{sfn|Tihen|2002|pp=2–3}} a college preparatory school for indigenous men.{{sfn|Nesper|2014}} While she was at Carlisle, Bender formed a [[Camp Fire Girls]] program, to help girls learn domestic and artistic skills.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|pp=85–86}} On 12 June 1916, Bender married Roe Cloud at her brother Chief's home in Philadelphia.{{sfn|''The Native American''|1916|p=240}}

The couple made their home in Wichita, where Elizabeth worked at the American Indian Institute (AII), serving as matron and financial manager.{{sfn|Gridley|1936|p=34}} Because Henry had no prior experience teaching, she often served as an advisor and took an active part in running the school for twenty years.{{sfn|Messer|2009|pp=94, 102}}{{sfn|Nesper|2014}} Unlike other Native American schools, the  curriculum of AII included courses on indigenous cultures, in addition to the academic lessons.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=90}} Over the next several years, their family grew to include Elizabeth Marion (born 1917), Anne Woesha (born 1918), Lillian Alberta (born 1920), Ramona Clark (born 1922) and Henry Jr. (1926–1929). When Henry Jr. died, they adopted Jay Hunter, a family friend, who was not orphaned, but joined their family as was customary among the Winnebago.{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=108}} In 1931, Henry took a job with the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and began traveling as an investigator researching conditions, such as education, health and poverty, among Native American communities.{{sfn|Messer|2009|p=107}} He was often absent from the school and Elizabeth supervised it during those absences.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=91}} In 1932, she returned to school, taking courses at [[Wichita University]] part time, where she eventually earned her bachelor's degree.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|pp=92–93}} Henry had been appointed as the superintendent of the [[Haskell Institute]] in 1933 and would work in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] for the next two years.{{sfn|Goodwin|2017|p=69}} Elizabeth resigned from her duties at AII in 1934, but continued to live in Wichita so that the children could finish their schooling and herself took graduate courses at the [[University of Kansas]].{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|pp=92–93}} In 1937, fire destroyed the school and after struggling to remain open for two years, the decision was made to close the school in 1939.{{sfn|Tihen|2002|p=3}} That same year, Elizabeth was asked by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to serve as a delegate to represent minorities for the [[White House Conference on Children and Youth]], examining children and the role of democracy. At the conference, she met [[Sadie Orr Dunbar]], who was the current president of the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]] (GFWC).{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|pp=94–95}}

In 1940, the family relocated to the [[Umatilla Indian Reservation]], where Henry became superintendent of the agency there.{{sfn|Goodwin|2017|p=71}}{{sfn|U. S. Census|1940|p=2B}} Elizabeth became involved in the [[Woman's club movement]], founding the Oregon Trails Women's Club from women on the reservation.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=95}} Joining the Oregon State Federation of Women's Clubs, she was appointed to serve as chair for the state organization's Indian Welfare Committee{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=78}} in 1948. Her duties were to implement the club's outreach to Native American women and to help the club members implement the goals of equal citizenship for indigenous people.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=97}} Henry died of heart failure in 1950, before Elizabeth won the Golden Rule Foundation's Mother of the Year award for 1950.{{sfn|''Indianapolis Recorder''|1950|p=9}} In part, the award was given because all four of her daughters had gone on to earn university educations. Marion had been the first American Indian to graduate from [[Wellesley College]], Anne Woesha was the first indigenous woman to graduate from [[Vassar College|Vassar]], Lillian completed her education at the University of Kansas and Ramona graduated from Vassar.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=97}} The award propelled her to national speaking and writing engagements and to head the national Indian Affairs Division for the GFWC.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=99}} She was the first Native American to be named mother of the year, as well as the first to head the GFWC's Indian Affairs Division,{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|pp=97, 99}} which she led for eight years. Developing a "Point Four Program", which included desegregating Indian populations from mainstream schools and opportunities, providing leadership training, expanding cultural programs, and conducting studies.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=100}} She urged each affiliated club to develop Indian Affairs committees   and by 1951 had offices in forty state affiliates. She also pressed for state organizations to offer educational scholarships for Native children.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=104}} In regard to the last item, Roe Cloud traveled over 22,000 miles over the next two years assessing conditions for tribes in twenty-two states and the [[Territory of Alaska]].{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=100}} Simultaneously, she began participating as a field officer of the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI). She had directed a two-week summer stragegy workshop, held in [[Brigham City, Utah]] in 1951 and began working as a co-director, with [[D'Arcy McNickle]] for the American Indian Development Project.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=101}}

Roe Cloud used her voice as an advocate for indigenous people, arguing that though Native Americans could learn self-sufficiency, the government had to cease efforts to victimize tribes by usurping their power, their natural resources, and their customs. She proposed a Charter of Indian Rights, developed in the AID Project to the GFWC, which was adopted in 1952. In part, the plan called for the government to speed up its efforts to help tribes eliminate poverty and illiteracy, provide adequate health and resource safeguards, and allow Native communities the autonomy to manage their own affairs once they had shown an ability to do so.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=102}} She saw the role of the AID Project as one of advising and assisting in developing strategy, but allowing communities to establish their own goals and management processes.{{sfn|Goodwin|2017|p=97}} That same year, she was selected as the "Outstanding Indian" of the year by the [[American Indian Exposition]] of [[Anadarko, Oklahoma]].{{sfn|''The Ada Weekly News''|1952|p=6}} When [[Helen Peterson]] became the executive director of NCAI in 1953, Roe Cloud helped her transition into the job and took her to reservations throughout Indian country to make assessments of the various tribes and establish networking contacts.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=110}} With the passage of [[House concurrent resolution 108]], designed to implement the [[Indian termination policy]] to discharge federal trustee responsibility for Indian lands and force the tribes into [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilating]] to mainstream culture, Roe Cloud pressed the GFWC to oppose legislation aimed at terminating tribes.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|pp=102–103}} The GFWC leadership joined the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the [[American Legion]], other organizations, and the Native American community in opposition to termination, ultimately defeating the policy in the 1960s.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=103}}

==Death and Legacy==
Roe Cloud died on September 16, 1965 in [[Portland, Oregon]].{{sfn|''Statesman Journal''|1965|p=5}} Her ability to straddle two worlds, during the contentious decades of the Indian termination policies, allowed her to serve as a role model for generations which followed her activism. Rather than adopt the position of GFWG's first Indian Welfare Committee Chair, Stella Atwood, who backed American Indian rights, but proclaimed, "I will work ''for'' the Indians but not with them," Roe Cloud tried to involve indigenous people in creating their own solutions and reforms.{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=104}}{{sfn|Goodwin|2017|p=120}} Her daughter, Anne Woesha, would become an activist after her mother's death, participating in the [[Occupation of Alcatraz]].{{sfn|Tetzloff|2009|p=105}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37885">'''Emotion perception''' refers to the capacities and abilities of recognizing and identifying [[emotion]]s in others, in addition to [[biology|biological]] and [[physiology|physiological]] processes involved.  Emotions are typically viewed as having three components: subjective experience, physical changes, and [[cognition|cognitive]] appraisal; emotion [[perception]] is the ability to make accurate decisions about another's subjective experience by interpreting their physical changes through sensory systems responsible for converting these observed changes into mental representations. The ability to perceive emotion is believed to be both innate and subject to environmental influence and is also a critical component in social interactions. How emotion is experienced and interpreted depends on how it is perceived. Likewise, how emotion is perceived is dependent on past experiences and interpretations. Emotion can be accurately perceived in humans. Emotions can be perceived visually, audibly, through smell and also through bodily sensations and this process is believed to be different from the perception of non-emotional material.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Modes of perception==
Emotions can be perceived through visual, auditory, olfactory, and physiological sensory processes. Nonverbal actions can provide social partners with information about subjective and emotional states.  This nonverbal information is believed to hold special importance and sensory systems and certain brain regions are suspected to specialize in decoding emotional information for rapid and efficient processing.

=== Visual ===

{{Main|Visual system}}
The [[visual system]] is the primary mode of [[perception]] for the way people receive emotional information.  People use emotional cues displayed by social partners to make decisions regarding their [[affect (psychology)|affective state]]. Emotional cues can be in the form of [[facial expression]]s, which are actually a combination of many distinct muscle groups within the face, or [[human positions|bodily postures]] (alone or in relation to others), or found through the interpretation of a situation or environment known to have particular emotional properties (i.e., a [[funeral]], a [[wedding]], a [[war|war zone]], a scary alley, etc.). While the visual system is the means by which emotional information is gathered, it is the cognitive interpretation and evaluation of this information that assigns it emotional value, garners the appropriate [[cognition|cognitive]] resources, and then initiates a physiological response. This process is by no means exclusive to visual perception and in fact may overlap considerably with other modes of perception, suggesting an emotional sensory system comprising multiple perceptual processes all of which are processed through similar channels.

==== Facial perception ====

{{Main|Face perception}}
A great deal of research conducted on emotion perception revolves around how people perceive emotion in others' facial expressions. Whether the emotion contained in someone's face is classified categorically or along dimensions of [[valence (psychology)|valence]] and [[arousal]], the face provides reliable cues to one's subjective emotional state. As efficient as humans are in identifying and recognizing emotion in another's face, accuracy goes down considerably for most emotions, with the exception of happiness, when facial features are inverted (i.e., mouth placed above eyes and nose), suggesting that a primary means of facial perception includes the identification of [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] features that resemble a prototypical face, such that two eyes are placed above a nose which is above a mouth; any other formation of features does not immediately constitute a face and requires extra spatial manipulation to identify such features as resembling a face.

===== Discrete versus dimensional views =====

{{Main|Emotion classification}}
Research on the classification of perceived emotions has centered around the debate between two fundamentally distinct viewpoints.  One side of the debate posits that emotions are separate and discrete entities whereas the other side suggests that emotions can be classified as values on the dimensions of valence (positive versus negative) and arousal (calm/soothing versus exciting/agitating). [[Psychologist]] [[Paul Ekman]] supported the discrete emotion perspective with his groundbreaking work comparing emotion perception and expression between literate and preliterate cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Ekman, P. (1993). Facial expression of emotion. American Psychologist, 48, 384–392.&lt;/ref&gt; Ekman concluded that the ability to produce and perceive emotions is universal and innate and that emotions manifest categorically as basic emotions ([[anger]], [[disgust]], [[fear]], [[happiness]], [[sadness]], [[contempt]], [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]], and possibly [[contempt]]). The alternative dimensional view garnered support from psychologist James Russell, who is best known for his contributions toward the circumplex of emotion. Russell described emotions as [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]]s which lie on the dimensions of valence and arousal and it is the combination of these values which delineate emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, J.A. (1980). A circumplex model of affect. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 39, 1161–1178.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Robert Plutchik]] sought to reconcile these views and proposed that certain emotions be considered "primary emotions" which are grouped either positively or negatively and can then be combined to form more complex emotions, sometimes considered "secondary emotions", such as [[remorse]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[submission]], and [[anticipation (emotion)|anticipation]].  Plutchik created the "wheel of emotions" to outline his theory.&lt;ref&gt;Plutchik, R. (2002). Nature of emotions. American Scientist, 89, 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Culture =====

[[Culture]] plays a significant role in emotion perception, most notably in facial perception. Although the features of the face convey important information, the upper (eyes/brow) and lower (mouth/nose) regions of the face have distinct qualities that can provide both consistent and conflicting information. As values, [[etiquette]], and quality of social interactions vary across cultures, facial perception is believed to be moderated accordingly. In western cultures, where overt emotion is ubiquitous, emotional information is primarily obtained from viewing the features of the mouth, which is the most expressive part of the face. However, in eastern cultures, where overt emotional expression is less common and therefore the mouth plays a lesser role in emotional expression, emotional information is more often obtained from viewing the upper region of the face, primarily the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Yuki, M., Maddux, W. W., &amp; Masuda, T. (2007). Are the windows to the soul the same in the East and West? Cultural differences in using the eyes and mouth as cues to recognize emotions in Japan and the United States. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 43(2), 303–311. doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2006.02.004&lt;/ref&gt; These cultural differences suggest a strong environmental and learned component in emotion expression and emotion perception.

===== Context =====

Although facial expressions convey key emotional information, context also plays an important role in both providing additional emotional information and modulating what emotion is actually perceived in a facial expression. Contexts come in three categories: stimulus-based context, in which a face is physically presented with other sensory input that has informational value; perceiver-based context, in which processes within the brain or body of a perceiver can shape emotion perception; and cultural contexts that affect either the encoding or the understanding of facial actions.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, L. F., [[Batja Mesquita|Mesquita, B.]], &amp; Gendron, M. (2011). Context in Emotion Perception. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 20(5), 286–290. doi:10.1177/0963721411422522.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auditory ===

{{Main|Auditory system}}
The auditory system can provide important emotional information about the environment. [[Human voice|Voices]], screams, murmurs, and [[music]] can convey emotional information. Emotional interpretations of sounds tend to be quite consistent. Traditionally, emotion perception in the voice has been determined through research studies analyzing, via [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] parameters such as [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[Time|duration]], the way in which a speaker expresses an emotion, known as [[encoding]]. Alternatively, a listener who attempts to identify a particular emotion as intended by a speaker can [[wikt:decoding|decode]] emotion. More sophisticated methods include manipulating or [[synthesizer|synthesizing]] important prosodic parameters in speech signal (e.g., pitch, duration, loudness, voice quality) in both natural and simulated affective speech.&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, K.E., &amp; Clements, M.A. (1995). Analysis of the glottal excitation of emotionally styled and stressed speech. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 98, 88± 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitch and duration tend to contribute more to emotional recognition than loudness.&lt;ref&gt;Frick, R.W. (1985). Communicating emotion: the role of prosodic features. Psychological Bulletin, 97, 412± 429.&lt;/ref&gt; Music has long been known to have emotional qualities and is a popular strategy in emotion regulation. When asked to rate emotions present in classical music, music professionals could identify all six basic emotions with happiness and sadness the most represented, and in decreasing order of importance, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust.&lt;ref&gt;Kallinen, K. (2005). Emotional ratings of music excerpts in the Western art music repertoire and their self-organization in the Kohonen Neural Network. Psychology of Music, 33(4), 373–393.&lt;/ref&gt; The emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, and peacefulness can be perceived in a short length of exposure, as little as 9–16 seconds&lt;ref&gt;Vieillard, S., Peretz, I., Gosselin, N., Khalfa, S., Gagnon, L., &amp; Bouchard, B. (2008). Happy, sad, scary and peaceful musical excerpts for research on emotions. Cognition &amp; Emotion, 22(4), 720–752.&lt;/ref&gt; including instrumental-only music selections.&lt;ref&gt;Mohn, C., Argstatter, H., &amp; Wilker, F. W. (2011). Perception of six basic emotions in music. Psychology of Music, 39(4), 503–517. doi:10.1177/0305735610378183.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Olfactory ===

{{Main|Olfactory system}}
Aromas and scents also influence mood, for example through aromatherapy,&lt;ref&gt;Herz, R. S. (2009). Aromatherapy Facts and Fictions: A Scientific Analysis of Olfactory Effects on Mood, Physiology and Behavior. International Journal of Neuroscience, 119(2), 263–290. doi:10.1080/00207450802333953&lt;/ref&gt; and humans can extract emotional information from scents just as they can from facial expressions and emotional music. Odors may be able to exert their effects through learning and conscious perception, such that responses typically associated with particular odors are learned through association with their matched emotional experiences. In-depth research has documented that emotion elicited by odors, both pleasant and unpleasant, affects the same physiological correlates of emotion seen with other sensory mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Alaoui-Ismaili, O., Robin, O., Rada, H., Dittmar, A., &amp; Vernet-Maury, E. (1997). Basic emotions evoked by odorants: Comparison between autonomic responses and self-evaluation. Physiology &amp; Behavior, 62, 713–720.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Somatic ===

Theories on emotion have focused on perception, subjective experience, and appraisal. Predominant theories of emotion and emotion perception include what type of emotion is perceived, how emotion is perceived [[Somatic marker hypothesis|somatic]]ally, and at what stage of an event emotion is perceived and translated into subjective, physical experience.

==== James-Lange theory ====

{{Main|James–Lange theory}}
Following the influence of [[René Descartes]] and his ideas regarding the split between body and mind, in 1884 [[William James]] proposed the theory that it is not that the human body acts in response to our emotional state, as common sense might suggest, but rather, we interpret our emotions on the basis of our already present bodily state. In the words of James, "we feel sad because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, and neither we cry, strike, nor tremble because we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be."  James believed it was particular and distinct physical patterns that map onto specific experienced emotions. Contemporaneously, psychologist [[Carl Lange (psychologist)|Carl Lange]] arrived at the same conclusion about the experience of emotions. Thus, the idea that felt emotion is the result of perceiving specific patterns of bodily responses is called the James-Lange theory of emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Walter B.|title=The James-Lange theory of emotion: A critical examination and an alternative theory.|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|year=1927|volume=39|pages=106–124|doi=10.2307/1415404}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In support of the James-Lange theory of emotion, [[Silvan Tomkins]] proposed the facial feedback hypothesis in 1963; he suggested that facial expressions actually trigger the experience of emotions and not the other way around. This theory was tested in 1974 by James Laird in an experiment where Laird asked participants to hold a pencil either between their teeth (artificially producing a smile) or between their upper lip and their nose (artificially producing a frown) and then rate cartoons. Laird found that these cartoons were rated as being funnier by those participants holding a pencil in between their teeth. In addition, [[Paul Ekman]] recorded extensive physiological data while participants posed his basic emotional facial expressions and found that heart rate raised for sadness, fear, and anger yet did not change at al for happiness, surprise, or disgust, and skin temperature raised when participants posed anger but not other emotions. While contemporary psychologists still agree with the James-Lange theory of emotion, human subjective emotion is complex and physical reactions or antecedents do not fully explain the subjective emotional experience.

==== Cannon-Bard theory of emotion ====

{{Main|Cannon-Bard theory}}
[[Walter Bradford Cannon]] and his doctoral student Philip Bard agreed that physiological responses played a crucial role in emotions, but did not believe that physiological responses alone could explain [[subjectivity|subjective]] emotional experiences. They argued that physiological responses were too slow relative to the relatively rapid and intense subjective awareness of emotion and that often these emotions are similar and imperceptible to people at such a short timescale. Cannon proposed that the mind and body operate independently in the experience of emotions such that differing brain regions (cortex versus subcortex) process information from an emotion-producing stimulus independently and simultaneously resulting in both an emotional and a physical response. This is best illustrated by imagining an encounter with a grizzly bear; you would simultaneously experience fear, begin to sweat, experience an elevated heart rate, and attempt to run. All of these things would happen at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Walter B.|title=Organization for Physiological Homeostasis|journal=Physiological Reviews|year=1929|volume=9|issue=3|pages=399–421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Two-factor theory ====

{{Main|Two-factor theory of emotion}}
[[Stanley Schachter]] and his doctoral student Jerome Singer formulated their theory of emotion based on evidence that without an actual emotion-producing stimulus, people are unable to attribute specific emotions to their bodily states. They believed that there must be a cognitive component to emotion perception beyond that of just physical changes and subjective feelings. Schachter and Singer suggested that when someone encounters such an emotion-producing stimulus, they would immediately recognize their bodily symptoms (sweating and elevated heart rate in the case of the grizzly bear) as the emotion fear. Their theory was devised as a result of a study in which participants were injected with either a stimulant (adrenaline) that causes elevated heart rate, sweaty palms and shaking, or a placebo. Participants were then either told what the effects of the drug were or were told nothing, and were then placed in a room with a person they did not know who, according to the research plan, would either play with a hula hoop and make paper airplanes (euphoric condition) or ask the participant intimate, personal questions (angry condition). What they found was that participants who knew what the effects of the drug were attributed their physical state to the effects of the drug; however, those who had no knowledge of the drug they received attributed their physical state to the situation with the other person in the room. These results led to the conclusion that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of a two-stage process: first, physiological arousal in a response to an evoking stimulus, and second, cognitive elaboration of the context in which the stimulus occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Schachter, S., &amp; Singer, J. (1962). Cognitive, Social, and Physiological Determinants of Emotional State. Psychological Review, 69, pp. 379–399&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neural bases==
Emotion perception is primarily a cognitive process driven by particular brain systems believed to specialize in identifying emotional information and subsequently allocating appropriate cognitive resources to prepare the body to respond. The relationship between various regions is still unclear, but a few key regions have been implicated in particular aspects of emotion perception and processing including areas suspected of being involved in the processing of faces and emotional information.

=== Fusiform face area ===

{{Main|Fusiform face area}}
The fusiform face area, part of the [[fusiform gyrus]] is an area some believe to specialize in the identification and processing of human faces, although others suspect it is responsible for distinguishing between well known objects such as cars and animals{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. [[Neuroimaging]] studies have found activation in this area in response to participants viewing images of prototypical faces, but not scrambled or inverted faces, suggesting that this region is specialized for processing human faces but not other material. This area has been an area of increasing debate and while some psychologists may approach the fusiform face area in a simplistic manner, in that it specializes in the processing of human faces, more likely this area is implicated in the visual processing of many objects, particularly those familiar and prevalent in the environment. Impairments in the ability to recognize subtle differences in faces would greatly inhibit emotion perception and processing and have significant implications involving social interactions and appropriate biological responses to emotional information.

=== HPA axis ===

{{Main|Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis}}
The [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]]-[[pituitary gland|pituitary]]-[[adrenal gland|adrenal]] [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis|(HPA) axis]] plays a role in emotion perception through its [[mediation]] of the physiological [[stress response]]. This occurs through the release of hypothalamic [[corticotropin-releasing hormone|corticotropin-releasing factor]], also known as corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), from nerve terminals in the [[median eminence]] arising in the [[paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus|paraventricular nucleus]], which stimulates [[adrenocorticotropic hormone|adrenocorticotropin]] release from the [[anterior pituitary]] that in turn induces the release of [[cortisol]] from the adrenal cortex. This progressive process culminating in the release of [[glucocorticoid]]s to environmental stimuli is believed to be initiated by the amygdala, which evaluates the emotional significance of observed phenomena. Released glucocorticoids provide negative feedback on the system and also the [[hippocampus]], which in turn regulates the shutting off of this biological stress response. It is through this response that information is encoded as emotional and bodily response is initiated, making the HPA axis an important component in emotion perception.

=== Amygdala ===

{{Main|Amygdala}}
The [[amygdala]] appears to have a specific role in attention to emotional stimuli.&lt;ref name="Davis M 2001"&gt;Davis M, Whalen PJ (2001): The amygdala: Vigilance and emotion. Molecular Psychiatry 6:3–34.&lt;/ref&gt;  The amygdala is a small, almond-shaped region within the anterior part of the temporal lobe. Several studies of non-human primates and of patients with amygdala lesions, in addition to studies employing functional neuroimaging techniques, have demonstrated the importance of the amygdala in face and eye-gaze identification.&lt;ref name="Davis M 2001"/&gt; Other studies have emphasized the importance of the amygdala for the identification of emotional expressions displayed by others, in particular threat-related emotions such as fear, but also sadness and happiness. In addition, the amygdala is involved in the response to non-facial displays of emotion, including unpleasant auditory, olfactory and gustatory stimuli, and in memory for emotional information.&lt;ref&gt;Calder AJ, Lawrence AD, Young AW (2001): Neuropsychology of fear and loathing. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 2, 352–363.&lt;/ref&gt; The amygdala receives information from both the thalamus and the cortex; information from the thalamus is rough in detail and the amygdala receives this very quickly, while information from the cortex is much more detailed but is received more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;LeDoux, J. E. (1995). Emotion: Clues from the brain. Annual Review of Psychology, 46(1), 209–235.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the amygdala's role in attention modulation toward emotion-specific stimuli may occur via projections from the central nucleus of the amygdala to cholinergic neurons, which lower cortical neuronal activation thresholds and potentiate cortical information processing.&lt;ref&gt;Whalen PJ (1998): Fear, vigilance, and ambiguity: Initial neuro-imaging studies of the human amygdala. Current Directions in Psychological Science 7:177–188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disordered emotion perception==
There is great individual difference in emotion perception and certain groups of people display abnormal processes. Some disorders are in part classified by maladaptive and abnormal emotion perception while others, such as mood disorders, exhibit mood-congruent emotional processing. Whether abnormal processing leads to the exacerbation of certain disorders or is the result of these disorders is yet unclear, however, difficulties or deficits in emotion perception are common among various disorders.

Research investigating face and emotion perception in autistic individuals is inconclusive. Past research has found atypical, piecemeal face-processing strategies among autistic individuals&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, G., Webb, S. J., &amp; McPartland, J. (2005). Understanding the nature of face processing impairment in autism: insights from behavioral and electrophysiological studies. Developmental Neuropsychology, 27(3), 403–424.&lt;/ref&gt; and a better memory for lower versus upper regions of the face and increased abilities to identify partly obscured faces.&lt;ref&gt;Tantam, D., Monoghan, L., Nicholson, H., &amp; Stirling, J. (1989). Autistic children's ability to interpret faces: A research note. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 30, 623–630.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Langdell, T. (1978). Recognition of faces: An approach to the study of autism. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines, 19, 255–268.&lt;/ref&gt; Autistic individuals tend to display deficits in social motivation and experience that may decrease overall experience with faces and this in turn may lead to abnormal cortical specialization for faces and decreased processing efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, G., Carver, L., Meltzoff, A., Panagiotides, H., McPartland, J., &amp; Webb, S. (2002). Neural correlates of face and object recognition in young children with autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, and typical development. Child Development, 73, 700–717.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these results have not been adequately replicated and meta-analyses have found little to no differential face processing between typically-developing and autistic individuals although autistic people reliably display worse face memory and eye perception which could mediate face and possibly emotion perception.&lt;ref&gt;Weigelt, S., Koldewyn, K., &amp; Kanwisher, N. (2012). Face identity recognition in autism spectrum disorders: A review of behavioral studies. Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews, 36(3), 1060–1084. doi:10.1016/j.neubiorev.2011.12.008&lt;/ref&gt;
Individuals with [[schizophrenia]] also have difficulties with all types of facial emotion expression perception,&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, C. G., Walker, J. B., Martin, E. A., Healey, K. M., &amp; Moberg, P. J. (2010). Facial Emotion Perception in Schizophrenia: A Meta-analytic Review.

Emotion Perception in Schizophrenia: Context Matters. Emotion Review, 4(2), 182–186. doi:10.1177/1754073911430140&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed, facial perception more generally.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, S. L., &amp; Neale, J. M. (1993). Emotion perception in schizophrenia: Specific deficit or further evidence of generalized poor performance? Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 102, 312–318.&lt;/ref&gt;  Neuropathological and structural neuroimaging studies of these patients have demonstrated abnormal neuronal cell integrity and volume reductions in the amygdala, insula, thalamus and hippocampus &lt;ref&gt;Wright, I. C., [[Sophia Rabe-Hesketh|Rabe-Hesketh, S.]], Woodruff, P.W. R., et al (2000) Regional brain structure in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis of volumetric MRI studies. American Journal of Psychiatry, 157, 16^25.&lt;/ref&gt; and studies employing functional neuro-imaging techniques have demonstrated a failure to activate limbic regions in response to emotive stimuli,&lt;ref&gt;Crespo-Facorro, B., Paradiso, S., Andreasen, N. C., et al (2001) Neural mechanisms of anhedonia in schizophrenia. JAMA, 286, 427^435.&lt;/ref&gt; all of which may contribute to impaired psychosocial functioning.

In patients with [[major depressive disorder]], studies have demonstrated either generalized or specific impairments in the identification of emotional facial expressions, or a bias towards the identification of expressions as sad.&lt;ref&gt;Gur, R. C., Erwin, R. J., Gur, R. E., et al (1992) Facial emotion discrimination. II: Behavioral findings in depression. Psychiatric Research, 42, 241^251.&lt;/ref&gt; Neuro-pathological and structural neuroimaging studies in patients with major depressive disorder have indicated abnormalities within the subgenual anterior cingulate gyrus and volume reductions within the hippocampus, ventral striatal regions and amygdala.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, M. L. (2003). Understanding the neurobiology of emotion perception: implications for psychiatry. The British Journal of Psychiatry, 182(3), 190–192. doi:10.1192/bjp.02.185&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[anxiety]] has been commonly associated with individuals being able to perceive threat when in fact none is present,&lt;ref&gt;Richards, A., French, C. C., Calder, A. J., Webb, B., Fox, R., &amp; Young, A. W. (2002). Anxiety-related bias in the classification of emotionally ambiguous facial expressions. Emotion, 2, 273–287.&lt;/ref&gt; and orient more quickly to threatening cues than other cues.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Haim, Y., Lamy, D., Pergamin, L., Bakermans-Kranenburg, M. J., &amp; van IJzendoorn, M. H. (2007). Threat-related attentional bias in anxious and nonanxious individuals: A meta-analytic study. Psychological Bulletin, 133, 1–24. doi:10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.1&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety has been associated with an enhanced orienting toward threat,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J. M. G., Watts, F. N., MacLeod, C., &amp; Matthews, A. (1988). Cognitive psychology and emotional disorders. Chichester, England:Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; a late-stage attention maintenance toward threat,&lt;ref&gt;Foa, E. B., &amp; Kozak, M. J. (1986). Emotional processing of fear: Exposure to corrective information. Psychological Bulletin, 99, 20–35.&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly vigilance-avoidance, or early-stage enhanced orienting and later-stage avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;Amir, N., Foa, E. B., &amp; Coles, M. E. (1998). Automatic activation and strategic avoidance of threat-relevant information in social phobia. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 107, 285–290.&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of anxiety, [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]] has also been linked with abnormal attention toward threatening information, in particular, threatening stimuli which relates to the personally relevant [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], making such a bias in that context appropriate, but out of context, maladaptive.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, T. C., Blanchard, E. B., &amp; Neill, W. T. (2000). Information processing and PTSD: A review of the empirical literature. Clinical Psychology Review, 28(8), 1041–1065.&lt;/ref&gt; Such processing of emotion can alter an individuals' ability to accurately assess others' emotions as well. Mothers with violence-related PTSD have been noted to show decreased medial prefrontal cortical activation in response to seeing their own and unfamiliar toddlers in helpless or distressed states of mind that is also associated with maternal PTSD symptom severity, self-reported parenting stress, and difficulty in identifying emotions and which, in turn, impacts sensitive caregiving.&lt;ref&gt;Moser DA, Aue T, Suardi F,  Manini A, Sancho Rossignol A, Cordero MI, Merminod G, Ansermet F, Rusconi Serpa S, Favez N, Schechter DS.

(epub October 28, 2015) http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01575/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, [[child abuse|child maltreatment]] and [[child abuse]] have been associated with emotion processing biases as well, most notably toward the experience-specific emotion of anger.&lt;ref&gt;Cicchetti, D., Toth, S. L., &amp; Maughan, A. (2000). An ecological- transactional model of child maltreatment. In A. J. Sameroff, M. Lewis, &amp; S. M. Miller (Eds.), Handbook of developmental psychopathology (2nd ed., pp. 689-722). New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has found that abused children exhibit attention biases toward angry faces &lt;ref name="Pine, D. S. 2005"&gt;Pine, D. S., Mogg, K., Bradley, B. P., Montgomery, L., Monk, C. S., McClure, E., et al. (2005). Attention bias to threat in maltreated children: Implications for vulnerability to stress-related psychopathology. American Journal of Psychiatry, 162, 291-296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollak, S. D., &amp; Tolley-Schell, S. A. (2003). Selective attention to facial emotion in physically abused children. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 112, 323-338.&lt;/ref&gt; such that they tend to interpret even ambiguous faces as angry versus other emotions &lt;ref&gt;Pollak, S. D., &amp; Kistler, D. J. (2002). Early experience is associated with the development of categorical representations for facial expressions of emotion. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 99, 9072-9076.&lt;/ref&gt; and have a difficulty disengaging from such expressions &lt;ref name="Pollak, S. D. 2003 pp. 102-111"&gt;Pollak, S. D. (2003). Experience-dependent affective learning and risk for psychopathology in children. In J. A. King, C. F. Ferris, &amp; I. I. Lederhendler (Eds.), Roots of mental illness in children (pp. 102-111). New York: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; while other research has found abused children to demonstrate an attentional avoidance of angry faces.&lt;ref name="Pine, D. S. 2005"/&gt; 
It is believed to be adaptive to attend to angry emotion as this may be a precursor to danger and harm and quick identification of even mild anger cues can facilitate the ability for a child to escape the situation,&lt;ref name="Pollak, S. D. 2003 pp. 102-111"/&gt; however, such biases are considered maladaptive when anger is over-identified in inappropriate contexts and this may result in the development of psychopathology.

==Research methods==
Researchers employ several methods designed to examine biases toward emotional stimuli to determine the salience of particular emotional stimuli, population differences in emotion perception, and also attentional biases toward or away from emotional stimuli. Tasks commonly utilized include the [[Stroop effect|modified Stroop task]], the [[Dot-probe paradigm|dot probe task]], [[Visual search|visual search tasks]], and [[Visual search|spatial cuing tasks]]. 
The Stroop task, or modified Stroop task, displays different types of words (e.g., threatening and neutral) in varying colors. The participant is then asked to identify the color of the word while ignoring the actual semantic content. Increased response time to indicate the color of threat words relative to neutral words suggests an attentional bias toward such threat.&lt;ref&gt;Stroop, J. R. (1935). Studies of interference in serial verbal reactions. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 18, 643−662 (Reprinted in 1992 in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 121, 15–23).&lt;/ref&gt; The Stroop task, however, has some interpretational difficulties&lt;ref&gt;Algom, D., Chajut, E., &amp; Lev, S. (2004). A rational look at the emotional Stroop paradigm: A generic slowdown, not a Stroop effect. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 133, 323−338.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the lack of allowance for the measurement of spatial attention allocation.&lt;ref name="MacLeod1986"&gt;MacLeod, C., Mathews, A., &amp; Tata, P. (1986). Attentional bias in the emotional disorders. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 95, 15−20.&lt;/ref&gt; To address some of the limitations of the Stroop task, the dot probe task displays two words or pictures on a computer screen (either one at the top or left and the other on the bottom or right, respectively) and after a brief stimuli presentation, often less than 1000ms, a probe appears in the location of one of the two stimuli and participants are asked to press a button indicating the location of the probe. Different response times between target (e.g., threat) and neutral stimuli infer attentional biases to the target information with shorter response times for when the probe is in the place of the target stimuli indicating an attention bias for that type of information.&lt;ref name="MacLeod1986"/&gt; In another task that examines spatial attentional allocation, the visual search task asks participants to detect a target stimulus embedded in a matrix of distractors (e.g., an angry face among several neutral or other emotional faces or vice versa). Faster detection times to find emotional stimuli among neutral stimuli or slower detection times to find neutral stimuli among emotional distractors infer an attentional bias for such stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Öhman, A., Flykt, A., &amp; Esteves, F. (2001). Emotion drives attention: Detecting the snake in the grass. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 130, 466−478.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rinck, M., Becker, E. S., Kellermann, J., &amp; Roth, W. T. (2003). Selective attention in anxiety: Distraction and enhancement in visual search. Depression and Anxiety, 18, 18−28.&lt;/ref&gt; The spatial cuing task asks participants to focus on a point located between two rectangles at which point a cue is presented, either in the form of one of the rectangles lighting up or some emotional stimuli appearing within one of the rectangles and this cue either directs attention toward or away from the actual location of the target stimuli. Participants then press a button indicating the location of the target stimuli with faster response times indicating an attention bias toward such stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, E., Russo, R., Bowles, R., &amp; Dutton, K. (2001). Do threatening stimuli draw or hold visual attention in subclinical anxiety? Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 130, 681−700.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Posner, M. I. (1980).

'''Engineering analysis''' involves the application of scientific analytic principles and processes to reveal the properties and state of a system, device or mechanism under study.  Engineering analysis is decompositional: it proceeds by separating the engineering design into the mechanisms of operation or failure, analyzing or estimating each component of the operation or failure mechanism in isolation, and re-combining the components according to basic physical principles and natural laws.&lt;ref&gt;Baecher, G.B., Pate, E.M., and de Neufville, R. (1979) “Risk of dam failure in benefit/cost analysis”, Water Resources Research, 16(3), 449-456.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartford, D.N.D. and Baecher, G.B. (2004) Risk and Uncertainty in Dam Safety.

==Remote systems==
Engineering analysis is the primary method for predicting and handling issues with remote systems such as [[Satellite|satellites]] and rovers. Engineering analysis for remote systems must be ongoing since the health and safety of the remote system can only be affected remotely (and because any failure could have fatal consequences). The capabilities of engineering analysis therefore must incorporate trending as well as analysis. Trending should be proactive, predictive, comprehensive and automated. Analysis must be reactive, investigative, targeted and hands-on. Together trending and analysis allow operators to both predict potential situations and identify anomalous events that threaten a remote system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14312">Environmental personhood is a legal concept which designates certain environmental entities the status of a [[legal person]]. This assigns to these entities, the [[rights]], protections, privileges, responsibilities and [[legal liability]] of a legal personality. Environmental personhood emerged from the evolution of legal focus in pursuit of the protection of [[nature]]. Over time, focus has evolved from human interests in exploiting nature, to protecting nature for future human generations, to conceptions that allow for nature to be protected as intrinsically valuable.&lt;ref&gt; Gwendolyn Gordon. "Environmental Personhood." (2017), at page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept can be used as a vehicle for recognising [[Indigenous peoples]]' relationships to natural entities, such as rivers.&lt;ref&gt;James DK Morris and Jacinta Ruru. "Giving Voice to Rivers: Legal Personality as a Vehicle for Recognising Indigenous Peoples' Relationships to Water." ''AILR'' 14 (2010): 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental personhood, which assigns nature (or aspects of it) certain rights, concurrently provides a means to individuals or groups such as Indigenous peoples to fulfill their human rights.

==Background==

The [[United States]] Professor Christopher D. Stone first discussed the idea of attributing legal personality to natural objects in the 1970s, in his article "Should trees have standing? Towards legal rights for natural objects".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher D. Stone. "Should Trees Have Standing--Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects." ''Southern California Law Review'' 45 (1972): 450.&lt;/ref&gt;  A legal person cannot be owned; therefore, no ownership can be attributed to an environmental entity with established legal personality. [[Standing (law)]] is directly related to legal personality. Entities with standing, or [[locus standi]], have the right or capacity to bring action or appear in court. Environmental entities cannot themselves bring action or appear in court. However, this action or standing can be achieved on behalf of the entity by a representing [[legal guardian]]. Representation could increase protection of culturally significant aspects of the natural environment, or areas vulnerable to exploitation and pollution.

==Domestic rights of nature==

===New Zealand===

In 2014, Te Urewera National Park was declared ''[[Te Urewera]]'', an environmental legal entity.&lt;ref&gt;Te Urewera Act 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The area encompassed by ''Te Urewera'' ceased to be a government-owned national park and was transformed into freehold, inalienable land owned by itself.&lt;ref&gt;Te Urewera Act 2014, ss 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the same trend, [[New Zealand]]’s [[Whanganui River]] was declared to be a legal person in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017, s 14.&lt;/ref&gt; This new legal entity was named ''Te Awa Tupua'' and is now recognised as “an indivisible and living whole from the mountains to the sea, incorporating the Whanganui River and all of its physical and metaphysical elements.”&lt;ref&gt;Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017, s 13(b).&lt;/ref&gt; The river would be represented by two guardians, one from the Whanganui iwi and the other from the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/16/new-zealand-river-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-being/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===

The [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] Rivers are now considered legal persons in an effort to combat pollution. The rivers are sacred to [[Hindu]] culture for their healing powers and attraction of [[pilgrims]] who bathe and scatter the ashes of their dead.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Susan Bliss. "A river is a 'person'." 49 ''Geography Bulletin'' No 2 (2017): 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The rivers have been heavily polluted by 1.5 billion litres of untreated sewage and 500 million litres of industrial waste entering the rivers daily.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/ganges-and-yamuna-rivers-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-beings/.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The High Court in the northern Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]] ordered in March 2017 that the Ganges and its main tributary, the Yamuna, be assigned the status of legal entities. The rivers would gain “all corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a living person.” This decision meant that polluting or damaging the rivers is equivalent to harming a person. The court cited the example of the New Zealand Whanganui River, which was also declared to possess full rights of a legal person.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/ganges-and-yamuna-rivers-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-beings/.&lt;/ref&gt;

This development of environmental personhood has been met with scepticism as merely announcing that the Ganges and Yamuna are living entities will not save them from significant, ongoing pollution. There is a possible need to change long-held cultural attitudes towards the Ganges, which hold that the river has self-purifying properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep.org/stories/story/rights-rivers/.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is further criticism that the guardianship of the rivers was only granted to Uttarakhand, a region in northern India which houses a small part of the rivers’ full extent. The Ganges flows for 2,525km through Uttarakhand, [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]] and [[West Bengal]], with only a 96km stretch running through Uttarakhand. Only a small section of the 1,376km Yamuna tributary runs through Uttarakhand – which also crosses through the states of [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Delhi]] and Uttar Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep.org/stories/story/rights-rivers/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of scepticism surrounding the decision of the Uttarakhand High Court, proclaiming these vulnerable rivers as legal entities invokes a movement of change towards environmental and cultural rights protection. The decisions may be built upon as a foundation for future environmental legislative change. 

===United States===

In 2006, a small community in [[Pennsylvania]] called [[Tamaqua]] Borough worked with a rights of nature group called Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund.&lt;ref&gt;CELDF. https://celdf.org/.&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the groups drafted legislation to protect the community and its environment from the dumping of toxic sewage.&lt;ref&gt; Gwendolyn Gordon. "Environmental Personhood." (2017), at page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2006, CELDF has assisted with over 30 communities in ten states across the United States to develop local laws codifying the rights of nature. CELDF also assisted in the drafting of Ecuador's 2008 constitution following a national referendum.&lt;ref&gt;CELDF, Rights of Nature: Timeline. https://celdf.org/rights/rights-of-nature/rights-nature-timeline/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecuador===

The rights of nature “to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles” have been proclaimed under [[Ecuador]]’s [[2008 Constitution of Ecuador|2008 constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador (October 20, 2008), http://therightsofnature.org/wpcontent/uploads/pdfs/Rights-for-Nature-Articles-in-Ecuadors-Constitution.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred after a national referendum in 2008, allowing the Ecuador constitution to reflect rights for nature, a world first.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew C. Revkin, Ecuador Constitution Grants Rights to Nature, New York Times, (September 29, 2008), http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/ecuador-constitution-grants-nature-rights/.&lt;/ref&gt; Every person and community has the right to advocate on nature's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador (October 20, 2008), Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Constitution proclaims that the “State shall give incentives to natural persons and legal entities and to communities to protect nature and to promote respect for all the elements comprising an [[ecosystem]].”&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador (October 20, 2008), Article 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful case of the rights of nature implementation under Ecuador constitutional law was presented before the Provincial Court of Justice of [[Loja, Ecuador|Loja]] in 2011. This case involved the [[Vilcabamba, Ecuador|Vilcabamba]] River as the plaintiff, representing itself with its own rights to ‘exist’ and ‘maintain itself’ – as it attempted to halt construction of a government highway project interfering with the natural health of the river.This case was brought before court by two individuals, Richard Frederick Wheeler and Eleanor Geer Huddle, as legal guardians acting in favour of nature – specifically the Vilcabamba River. A constitutional injunction was granted in favour of the Vilcabamba River and against the Provincial government of Loja, attempting to conduct the environmentally-harmful project. The project was forced to be halted and the area was to be rehabilitated.&lt;ref&gt; Natalia Greene. "The first successful case of the Rights of Nature implementation in Ecuador." Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature. http://therightsofnature.org/first-ron-case-ecuador/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bolivia===

The constitutional change in Ecuador was followed legislatively by [[Bolivia]] in 2010, passing the ‘[[Law of the Rights of Mother Earth]]’ (''Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra''). This legislation designates [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]] the character of ‘a collective subject of [[public interest]]’&lt;ref&gt;Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 5.&lt;/ref&gt; with inherent rights specified in the law.&lt;ref&gt;Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Law of the Rights of Mother Earth give aspects of legal personhood to the natural environment. Judicial action can be taken for infringements against individuals and groups as part of Mother Earth as ‘a collective subject of public interest’.&lt;ref&gt;Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 6.&lt;/ref&gt;   The legislation states that “Mother Earth is the dynamic living system made up of the indivisible community of all living systems, living, interrelated, interdependent and complementary, sharing a common destiny.”&lt;ref&gt;Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Colombia===

The [[Colombia]] [[Constitutional Court of Colombia|Constitutional Court]] found in November 2016 that the [[Atrato River]] basin possesses rights to "protection, conservation, maintenance, and restoration." This ruling came about as a result of degradation to the river basin from mining, impacting nature and harming of Indigenous peoples and their culture. The court referred to the New Zealand declaration of the Whanganui River as a legal person holding environmental personhood. The court ordered that joint guardianship would be undertaken in the representation of the Atrato River basin. Similarly to the New Zealand declaration, the representatives would come from the national government and the Indigenous people living in the basin.&lt;ref&gt;https://celdf.org/2017/05/press-release-colombia-constitutional-court-finds-atrato-river-possesses-rights/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court stated:
:“''(I)t is the human populations that are interdependent of the natural world – and not the opposite – and that they must assume the consequences of their actions and omissions with the nature. It is a question of understanding this new sociopolitical reality with the aim of achieving a respectful transformation with the natural world and its environment, as has happened before with civil and political rights…Now is the time to begin taking the first steps to effectively protect the planet and its resources before it is too late…''”&lt;ref&gt;https://celdf.org/2017/05/press-release-colombia-constitutional-court-finds-atrato-river-possesses-rights/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance for cultural human rights==

The recognition of the Whanganui River as a legal entity in New Zealand (''Te Awa Tupua'') encompassed a vivid sense of cultural “inalienable connection” to the local iwi and hapu of the river. Maori culture considers natural features such as the Whanganui River as ancestors and iwi hold deep connections with them as living entities. This inalienable connection of indigenous culture to their natural surroundings is apparent in other parts of the world such as Colombia where a similar environmental personhood declaration was made for the Atrato River basin.

The lead negotiator for the Whanganui iwi, Gerrard Albert, said “we consider the river an ancestor and always have…treating the river as a living entity is the correct way to approach it, as an indivisible whole, instead of the traditional model for the last 100 years of treating it from a perspective of ownership and management.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/16/new-zealand-river-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-being/.&lt;/ref&gt; James D K Morris and Jacinta Ruru suggest that giving “legal personality to rivers is one way in which the law could develop to provide a lasting commitment to reconciling with Maori.” This was the longest-running legal dispute in New Zealand. The Whanganui iwi had been fighting to assert their rights in harmony with the river since the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;http://metro.co.uk/2017/03/16/whanganui-river-becomes-first-in-the-world-to-be-recognised-as-a-legal-person-6512264/.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a fundamental step forward for cultural rights as the environmental personhood status of the river means that if there was harm committed to the river, the law now sees no differentiation between harming the Whanganui iwi or harming the river as they are the same indivisible entity. The Whanganui iwi have a proverb which reads ''Ko au te Awa, ko te Awa ko au'': I am the River and the River is me - the iwi and hapu of the Whanganui River have an inalienable connection with, and responsibility to, ''Te Awa Tupua'' and its health and well-being.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15291">'''Experiments in Art and Technology''' ('''E.A.T.''') was a non-profit and tax-exempt organization established to develop collaborations between artists and engineers. The group operated by facilitating person-to-person contacts between [[artist]]s and [[engineer]]s, rather than defining a formal process for cooperation. E.A.T. initiated and carried out projects that expanded the role of the artist in contemporary society and helped explore the separation of the individual from technological change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]] (2003). ''[[Digital Art]]'' (World of Art series). London: Thames &amp; Hudson. p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
E.A.T. was officially launched in 1967 by the engineers [[Billy Klüver]] and [[Fred Waldhauer]] and the artists [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Robert Whitman]].&lt;ref&gt;Kristine Stiles &amp; Peter Selz, ''Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings'' (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt; These men had previously collaborated in 1966 when they together organized ''[[9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering]]'', a series of [[performance art]] presentations that united artists and engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=294|title=9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering : 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering Fonds|website=www.fondation-langlois.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 10 New York artists worked with 30 engineers and scientists from the world-renowned [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] to create groundbreaking performances that incorporated new technology. Artists involved with ''9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering'' include: [[John Cage]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Öyvind Fahlström]], Alex Hay, [[Deborah Hay]], [[Steve Paxton]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[David Tudor]], and [[Robert Whitman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=294|title=9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering Fonds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable engineers involved include: [[Bela Julesz]], [[Billy Klüver]], [[Max Mathews]], [[John R. Pierce|John Pierce]], [[Manfred R. Schroeder|Manfred Schroeder]], and [[Fred Waldhauer]].&lt;ref&gt;9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering. Edited by [[Pontus Hultén]] and Frank Königsberg. New York: ''Experiments in Art and Technology: The Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts'', 1966. 14 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Video projection]], [[wireless]] sound transmission, and [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] [[sonar]] had never been seen in the art of the 1960s. These art performances still resonate today as forerunners of the close and rapidly evolving relationship between artists and technology. The performances were held in [[New York City]]'s [[69th Regiment Armory]], on [[Lexington Avenue]] between 25th and 26th Streets as an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the original and historical 1913 [[Armory show]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=1734]''Vehicle,'' online, retrieved September 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=396] documents, history online, retrieved September 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The pinnacle of E.A.T. activity is generally considered to be the [[Pepsi]] Pavilion at Expo '70 at [[Osaka]] [[Japan]] where E.A.T. artists and engineers collaborated to design and program an [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]] [[dome]] that included a [[fog]] sculpture by [[Fujiko Nakaya]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal|Nechvatal, Joseph]]. (2012) ''Immersion Into Noise'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Organized by E.A.T. founders Billy Klüver and Robert Whitman, the project was led by a core design team that also included [[Robert Breer]], [[Forrest Myers|Frosty Myers]], [[David Tudor]],&lt;ref name="medienkunst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/pepsi-pavillon/images/6/?desc=full|title=Media Art Net - E.A.T. – Experiments in Art and Technology: Pepsi Pavilion for the Expo '70|first=Media Art|last=Net|date=6 April 2018|website=www.medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a group of over 75 artists and engineers from the US and Japan. The original structure consisted of a [[Buckminster Fuller]]-style [[geodesic dome]] covered by a water vapor cloud sculpture, designed by Fujiko Nakaya, to which the architect John Pearce had devised a way to fit a [[Mylar]] mirror inside the structure.&lt;ref name="medienkunst"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Product Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLYzAQAAIAAJ|year=1970|publisher=Morgan-Grampian Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[optical]] effect in the [[spherical]] mirror produced real images resembling that of a [[hologram]].&lt;ref name="Rieser2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Rieser|title=The Mobile Audience: Media Art and Mobile Technologies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVJIhT2rpYoC&amp;pg=PA57|year=2011|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-420-3128-X|pages=57–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the size of the mirror, a spectator looking at an image could walk around it and see it from all sides. On the terrace surrounding the Pepsi Pavilion were seven of Robert Breer’s "Floats", six-foot high [[kinetic sculpture]]s that moved around at less than 2 feet per minute, while emitting sounds.&lt;ref name="HerathKroos2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Damith Herath|author2=Christian Kroos|author3=Stelarc|title=Robots and Art: Exploring an Unlikely Symbiosis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_sgDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163|date=4 May 2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-981-10-0321-9|pages=163–}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a ""Float"" hit an obstacle or was pushed it would reverse direction.&lt;ref name="Tomkins1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Calvin Tomkins|title=The Scene: Reports on Post-modern Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXNQAAAAMAAJ|year=1976|publisher=Viking Press|isbn=978-0-670-62035-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Twenty-eight regional E.A.T. chapters were established throughout the U.S. in the late 1960s to promote [[collaboration]]s between artists and engineers and expand the artist’s role in social developments related to new technologies. In 2002 the [[University of Washington]] hosted a reunion to celebrate the history of these regional liaisons and consider the legacy of E.A.T. for artists working with [[new technologies]] in the 21st century.

E.A.T. activity has entered the canons of [[performance art]], experimental [[noise music]] and theater, bridging the gap from the eras of [[Dada]], [[Fluxus]] and the [[Happenings]]/Actions of the 1960s, through the current generation of [[digital art]]ists for whom multimedia and technology are the norm. The lineage from E.A.T. experimentations in the 1960s which led to media-art explorations of the 1990s and beyond, is the same historical pathway that has led to the ArtScience movement of the 2000s -- the latter an amalgamation of E.A.T., the environmental/ecology movements, and the expanding ontological impact scientific practice has on society. Most recently, E.A.T. included a collaboration with singer songwriter [[Beatie Wolfe]] for its 50 year anniversary, which involved the artist releasing her album as the world's first live 360˚ [[Augmented reality]] stream, from the [[Bell Labs]] anechoic chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2130155-augmented-reality-brings-beatie-wolfes-new-songs-to-life/|title=Augmented reality brings Beatie Wolfe’s new songs to life|work=New Scientist|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.de/collection/life/beatie-wolfe-interview-neues-album-raw-space-stream-ar-vinyl|title=Beatie Wolfe steht auf Vinyl – und macht deshalb Augmented Reality|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-02-01|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/beatie-wolfe-raw-space-bell-labs|title=AR brings ceremony to Beatie Wolfe’s Raw Space from Bell Labs’ room without echoes|last=O’Dea|first=Ann|date=2017-05-11|work=Silicon Republic|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentation==
In 1972 [[Billy Klüver]], [[Barbara Rose]] and Julie Martin edited the book "Pavilion", that documented the design and construction of the E.A.T. Pepsi Pavilion for [[Expo '70]] in [[Osaka, Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vasulka.org/archive/Writings/EAT.pdf|title=Experiments in Art and Technology,a brief history of projects, Vasulka.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=1716|title=9 Evenings and Experiments in Art and Technology: A gap to fill in art history's recent chronicles|publisher=Fondation Langlois}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 [[Billy Klüver]]  produced an exhibition of photo and text panels entitled "The Story of E.A.T.: Experiments in Art and Technology, 1960 &amp;ndash; 2001 by Billy Klüver."  It was first shown in [[Rome]] and then again at [[Sonnabend Gallery]] in 2002. The exhibition went to [[Lafayette College]] in the spring 2002, then to the Evolution Festival in Leeds, England, and University of Washington, in Seattle. In 2003 it traveled to [[San Diego State University]] in San Diego, California and then to a gallery in Santa Maria, California run by Ardison Phillips &amp;ndash; who was the artist who managed the Pepsi Pavilion in 1970. From April to June 2003 a Japanese version was shown at a large exhibition at the NTT Intercommunication Center (ICC) in [[Tokyo]] which also included a number of object/artifacts and documents and E.A.T. posters, as well as works of art that Klüver and E.A.T. were involved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=236|title=E.A.T. — The Story of Experiments in Art and Technology|website=www.fondation-langlois.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar showing took place in Norrköping Museum of Art, [[Norrköping]], Sweden in September 2004; and a small version of the panels were presented in 2008 at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] as part of a celebration of Experiments in Art and Technology. 
In November 2017, the E.A.T. projects were part of the ''VARIATION ArtJaws media art fair and exhibition'' at the Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris: All the panels and some of the below mentioned documentaries were exhibited.

The [[9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering]] DVD Series (director: Barbro Schultz Lundestam) is an important documentation of the collaborations between the artists and engineers that produced innovative works using these emerging technologies.&lt;ref&gt;"9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering" {{cite web |url=http://www.9evenings.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305133753/http://www.9evenings.org/ |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] describes the "'''Form of the Good'''", or more literally "the idea of the good" ({{lang|grc|ἡ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ ἰδέα}}), in his [[dialogue]] the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (508e2–3), speaking through the character of [[Socrates]].  Plato introduces several forms in his works, but identifies the Form of the Good as the superlative. This form is the one that allows a philosopher-in-training to advance to a philosopher-king. It cannot be clearly seen or explained, but once it is recognized, it is the form that allows one to realize all the other forms.

==Uses in ''The Republic''==
The first references that are seen in ''The Republic'' to the Form of the Good are within the conversation between [[Glaucon]] and [[Socrates]] (454 c–d).  When trying to answer such difficult questions pertaining to the definition of [[justice]], Plato identifies that we should not "introduce every form of difference and sameness in nature" instead we must focus on "the one form of sameness and difference that was relevant to the particular ways of life themselves" which is the form of the Good.  This form is the basis for understanding all other forms, it is what allows us to understand everything else.  Through the conversation between Socrates and Glaucon (508 a–c), Plato analogizes the form of the Good with the sun as it is what allows us to see things.  Here, Plato describes how the sun allows for sight.  But he makes a very important distinction, "sun is not sight" but it is "the cause of sight itself."  As the sun is in the visible realm, the form of Good is in the [[Intelligibility (philosophy)|intelligible]] realm.  It is "what gives truth to the things known and the power to know to the knower".  It is not only the "cause of knowledge and truth, it is also an object of knowledge".
 
Plato identifies how the form of the Good allows for the cognizance to understand such difficult concepts as justice.  He identifies knowledge and truth as important, but through Socrates (508d–e) says, "good is yet more prized".  He then proceeds to explain "although the good is not being" it is "superior to it in rank and power", it is what "provides for knowledge and truth" (508e).&lt;ref name=Reeve&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeve|first=Plato ; revised by C.D.C.|title=Republic|date=1992|publisher=Hackett Publ. Co|location=Indianapolis, Ind.|isbn=978-0-87220-136-1|edition=[2nd ed.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly analysis==
Plato writes that the Form (or Idea) of the Good is the ultimate object of knowledge, although it is not knowledge itself, and from the Good, things that are just, gain their usefulness and value. Humans are compelled to pursue the good, but no one can hope to do this successfully without philosophical reasoning. According to Plato, true [[epistemology|knowledge]] is conversant, not about those material objects and imperfect intelligences which we meet within our daily interactions with all mankind, but rather it investigates the nature of those purer and more perfect patterns which are the models after which all created beings are formed. Plato supposes these perfect types to exist from all eternity and calls them the ''Forms'' or ''Ideas''.&lt;ref&gt;"Idea" from the Greek ἰδέα, often transliterated in the past but now typically translated as "character". The archaic sense must be distinguished from the modern sense meaning "thought". Cf. Russell: "It must not be supposed that 'ideas', in his sense, exist in minds, though they may be apprehended by minds.... The word 'idea' has acquired, in the course of time, many associations which are quite misleading when applied to Plato's 'ideas'. (''The Problems of Philosophy'', chapter 9).&lt;/ref&gt;  As these Forms cannot be perceived by human senses, whatever [[knowledge]] we attain of the Forms must be seen through the mind's eye (cf. ''[[Parmenides dialogue|Parmenides]]'' 132a), while ideas derived from the concrete world of flux are ultimately unsatisfactory and uncertain (see the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''). He maintains that degree of skepticism which denies all permanent authority to the evidence of sense. In essence, Plato suggests that justice, truth, equality, beauty, and many others ultimately derive from the Form of the Good.

===Aristotle's criticism===
[[Aristotle]] discusses the Forms of Good in critical terms several times in both of his major surviving ethical works, the ''[[Eudemian Ethics|Eudemian]]'' and ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Aristotle argues that Plato's Form of the Good does not apply to the physical world, for Plato does not assign "goodness" to anything in the existing world.  Because Plato's Form of the Good does not explain events in the physical world, humans have no reason to believe that the Form of the Good exists and the Form of the Good is thereby irrelevant to human ethics.&lt;ref name=plat&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine|first=Gail|title=Plato on Knowledge and Forms|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-924559-2|pages=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticisms===
Plato's Form of the Good is often criticized as too general.&lt;ref name=BAR&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeve|first=C.D.C.|title=Blindness and reorientation : problems in Plato's Republic|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-993443-0|pages=165, 166|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plato's Form of the Good does not define things in the physical world that are good, and therefore lacks connectedness to reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herman|first=Arthur|title=The cave and the light : Plato versus Aristotle, and the struggle for the soul of Western civilization|date=2013|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-553-80730-1|page=46|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because Plato's Form of the Good lacks instruction, or ways for the individual to be good, Plato's Form of the Good is not applicable to human ethics since there is no defined method for which goodness can be pursued.  Through Socrates in ''The Republic'', Plato acknowledges the Form of the Good as an elusive concept and proposes that the Form of the Good be accepted as a hypothesis, rather than criticized for its weaknesses.  According to Socrates in ''The Republic'', the only alternative to accepting a hypothesis is to refute all the objections against it, which is counterproductive in the process of contemplation.&lt;ref name=BAR /&gt;

Aristotle along with other scholars sees the Form of the Good as synonymous with  the idea of One.&lt;ref name=Rev&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=R.W.|title=Platos Idee des Guten by Rafael Ferber Review|journal=The Classical Review|date=1986|volume=36|pages=65–67|jstor=3064234|doi=10.1017/s0009840x00105001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plato claims that Good is the highest Form, and that all objects aspire to be good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Banach|first=David|title=Plato's Theory of Forms|url=http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/platform.htm|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Plato does not define good things, interpreting Plato's Form of the Good through the idea of One allows scholars to explain how Plato's Form of the Good relates to the physical world. According to this philosophy, in order for an object to belong to the Form of the Good, it must be One and have the proper harmony, uniformity, and order to be in its proper form.&lt;ref name=Rev /&gt;

Philosopher Rafael Ferber dismissed Aristotle's view that the 'Good' is 'One' and wrote that the Form of the Good is self-contradictory.  Ferber claimed that Plato's Form of the Good could be simultaneously defined and unknown, and be in a state of both "being" and "not being".&lt;ref name=Rev /&gt;

Plato's Forms are also critiqued for being treated as the reason for all things, as opposed to being an essence in itself.  Some scholars also believe that Plato intended the Form to be the essence of which things come into existence.  These different interpretations of Plato's intention for the Form may be attributed to the idea that Plato did not have a systematic definition of the Form itself.&lt;ref name=plat /&gt;

==Influence==
Plato's writings on the meaning of virtue and justice permeate through the [[Western philosophy|Western philosophical]] tradition.&lt;ref name="The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2013 Edition)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Frede|first=Dorothy|title=Plato's Ethics: An Overview|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/plato-ethics/|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Plotinus]], the founder of [[Neoplatonism]], had principles that were heavily influenced by the Good.  His concept of 'the One' is equivalent to 'the Good' because it describes an ultimate [[ontological]] truth.  'The One' is both 'self-caused' and the cause of being for everything else in the universe.  Plotinus compared his principle of 'the One' to an illuminating light, as Plato did with the Form of the Good.  As a result of Plotinus' school of [[Neoplatonism]], the bulk of understanding of [[Platonic philosophy]] until the 19th Century came through Plotinus' interpretation of it.  The early theologies of Judaism, Christianity and Islam looked to the ideas of [[Platonism]] through the lens of [[Plotinus]].&lt;ref name="Stanford1"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plotinus/ ''Plotinus''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Amphis, a comic playwright of Athens, has one of his characters say: "And as for the good that you are likely to get on her account, I know no more about it, master, than I do of the good of Plato."&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]] 3.27&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ancient anecdotal tradition that Plato gave a public lecture entitled "On the Good" which so confused the audience that most walked out. At the end of the lecture Plato said to those hearers who remained: 'The Good is the One".&lt;ref&gt;Aristoxenus, ''Harmonics'' 30–31; see A. S. Riginos, ''Platonica'' (1976), pp. 124 ff., for further testimony.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1786">The '''fundamental theorem of software engineering''' (FTSE) is a term originated by [[Andrew Koenig (programmer)|Andrew Koenig]] to describe a remark by [[Butler Lampson]]&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams and Gurtovoy, C++ Template Metaprogramming, 2005, Addison Wesley, p13.&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to the late [[David Wheeler (computer scientist)|David J.

{{quote|"We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of [[indirection]]."}}

The theorem does not describe an actual theorem that can be proven; rather, it is a general principle for managing complexity through [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]].

The theorem is often expanded by the humorous clause "…except for the problem of too many levels of indirection," referring to the fact that too many abstractions may create intrinsic complexity issues of their own. For example, the use of protocol layering in [[computer network]]s, which today is ubiquitous, has been criticized in ways that are typical of more general disadvantages of abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Wakeman | first1 = I. | last2=Crowcroft | first2=J. | last3=Wang | first3=Z.|last4=Sirovica|first4=D. | date = Jan 1992| title = Is Layering Harmful?| journal = IEEE Network| pages =20–24| doi = 10.1109/65.120719}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the adding of extra levels of indirection may cause higher layers to [[Abstraction inversion|duplicate the functionality of lower layers]], leading to inefficiency, and functionality at one layer may need data present only at another layer, which fundamentally violates the goal of separation into different layers.

There are a variety of definitions and understandings of a global information system (GIS, GLIS), such as 

* A '''global information system (GIS)''' is an information system which is developed and / or used in a global context.&lt;ref&gt;Pawlowski, J.M.: Globale Informationssysteme (Global Information Systems). In: Kurbel, K., Becker, J., Gronau, N., Sinz, E., Suhl, L. (Eds.): Online Lexikon Wirtschaftsinformatik [http://www.enzyklopaedie-der-wirtschaftsinformatik.de/wi-enzyklopaedie/lexikon/uebergreifendes/Globalisierung/Globales-Informationssystem ''Online Encyclopedia Business Information Systems''], Oldenbourg, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''global information system''' (GIS) is any [[information system]] which attempts to deliver the totality of measurable data worldwide within a defined context. 

Common to this class of [[information systems]] is that the context is a global setting, either for its use or development process. This means that it highly relates to [[distributed systems]] / [[distributed computing]] where the distribution is global. The term also incorporates aspects of global software development and there [[outsourcing]] (when the outsourcing locations are globally distributed) and [[offshoring]] aspects. A specific aspect of global information systems is the case (domain) of [[global software development]].&lt;ref&gt;Sangwan, R., Bass, M., Mullick, N., Paulish, D.J., Kazmeier, J. (2006): Global Software Development Handbook, Auerback Publications, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8493-9384-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main research aspect in this field concerns the coordination of and collaboration between virtual teams.&lt;ref&gt;Carmel, E. (1999): Global Software Teams: Collaborating Across Borders and Time Zones (High Performance Cluster Computing) - {{ISBN|0-13-924218-X}}

== Tasks in designing global information systems ==
Critical tasks in designing global information systems are 
* Process and system design: How are the processes between distributed actors organized, how are the systems distributed / integrated.
* Technical architecture: What is the technical infrastructure enabling actors to collaborate?
* Support mechanisms: How are actors in the process of communication, collaboration, and cooperation supported?

A variety of examples can be given. Basically every multi-lingual website can be seen as a global information system. However, mostly the term GLIS is used to refer to a specific system developed or used in a global context.

== Examples ==
Specific examples are 
* Systems developed for multinational users, e.g., [http://www.sap.com SAP as a global ERP system]
* Global Information Systems for Education: [http://www.globe-info.org/ The Global Learning Objects Brokered Exchange]
* For the specific case of data integration : http://data.un.org, http://www.internettrafficreport.com, http://www.unhcr.org/statistics.html

[[File:Alexander cuts the Gordian Knot.jpg|thumb|250px|''Alexander cuts the Gordian Knot'' by [[Jean-Simon Berthélemy]] (1743–1812)]]
[[File:Jean-François Godefroy Alexandre et le noeud gordien.JPG|thumb|''Alexander Cutting the Gordian Knot'' (1767) by Jean-François Godefroy]][[File:Alexander cutting the Gordian knot by Andre Castaigne (1898-1899).jpg|thumb|''Alexander Cutting the Gordian Knot'' by [[André Castaigne]] (1898-1899)]]

The '''Gordian Knot''' is a [[legend]] of [[Phrygia]]n [[Gordium]] associated with [[Alexander the Great]]. It is often used as a [[metaphor]] for an intractable problem (disentangling an "impossible" knot) solved easily by finding a loophole or thinking creatively ("cutting the Gordian knot"):

}}

== Legend ==
The [[Phrygians]] were without a king, but an [[oracle]] at [[Telmissus]] (the ancient capital of [[Lycia]]) decreed that the next man to enter the city driving an ox-cart should become their king. A peasant farmer named [[Gordias]] drove into town on an ox-cart and was immediately declared king.&lt;ref&gt;The ox-cart is often depicted in works of art as a [[chariot]], which made it a more readily legible emblem of power and military readiness. His position had also been predicted earlier by an eagle landing on his cart, a sign to him from the gods.&lt;/ref&gt;  Out of gratitude, his son [[Midas]] dedicated the ox-cart&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' (Αλεξάνδρου Ανάβασις), Book ii.3): "{{lang|grc|καὶ τὴν ἅμαξαν τοῦ πατρὸς ἐν τῇ ἄκρᾳ ἀναθεῖναι χαριστήρια τῷ Διὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ ἐπὶ τοῦ ἀετοῦ τῇ πομπῇ.}}" which means "and he offered his father's cart as a gift to king Zeus as gratitude for sending the eagle".&lt;/ref&gt;  to the Phrygian god [[Sabazios]] (whom the [[Greeks]] identified with [[Zeus]]) and tied it to a post with an intricate knot of [[European Cornel|cornel]] bark (''Cornus mas''). The knot was later described by Roman historian [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]] as comprising “several knots all so tightly entangled that it was impossible to see how they were fastened.”&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andrews|first1=Evan|title=What was the Gordian Knot?|url=http://www.history.com/news/ask-history/what-was-the-gordian-knot|website=Ask History|accessdate=30 May 2017|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ox-cart still stood in the palace of the former kings of Phrygia at [[Gordium]] in the fourth century BC when Alexander arrived, at which point Phrygia had been reduced to a [[satrap|satrapy]] or province of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. An oracle had declared that any man who could unravel its elaborate knots was destined to become ruler of all of Asia.&lt;ref name="Andrews"/&gt; Alexander wanted to untie the knot but struggled to do so without success. He then reasoned that it would make no difference ''how'' the knot was loosed, so he drew his sword and sliced it in half with a single stroke.&lt;ref name="Andrews"/&gt; In an alternative version of the story, Alexander loosed the knot by pulling the [[linchpin]] from the yoke.&lt;ref name="Andrews"/&gt;

Sources from antiquity agree that Alexander was confronted with the challenge of the knot, but his solution is disputed. Both [[Plutarch]] and [[Arrian]] relate that, according to [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulus]],&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, "The Campaigns of Alexander", p. 105, [[Penguin Group]] 1971, and Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander'', p. 19, The Modern Library 2004 are secondary sources; Aristobolus' text is lost.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander pulled the knot out of its pole pin, exposing the two ends of the cord and allowing him to untie the knot without having to cut through it. Some classical scholars regard this as more plausible than the popular account.&lt;ref&gt;Fredricksmeyer, E. A. "Alexander, Midas, and the Oracle at Gordium" ''Classical Philology'', Vol. 56, No. 3 (July, 1961), pp. 160–168 citing Tarn, W.W. 1948, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/265752?seq=1]&lt;/ref&gt; Literary sources of the story include Alexander's propagandist [[Arrian]] (''[[Anabasis Alexandri]] ''2.3), [[Quintus Curtius]] (3.1.14), [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]'s epitome of [[Pompeius Trogus]] (11.7.3), and [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]]'s ''De Natura Animalium'' 13.1.&lt;ref&gt;The four sources are given in Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great'' (1973) 1986: Notes to Chapter 10, p. 518; Fox recounts the anecdote, pp 149–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander later went on to conquer Asia as far as the [[Indus River|Indus]] and the [[Amu Darya|Oxus]], thus fulfilling  the prophecy.

== Interpretations ==
The knot may have been a religious knot-cipher guarded by Gordian/Midas's priests and priestesses. [[Robert Graves]] suggested that it may have symbolised the ineffable name of [[Dionysus]] that, knotted like a cipher, would have been passed on through generations of priests and revealed only to the kings of Phrygia.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, ''The Greek Myths'' (1960) §83.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[fable]], true [[mythology|myth]] has few completely arbitrary elements. This myth taken as a whole seems designed to confer legitimacy to [[dynastic]] change in this central [[Anatolia]]n kingdom: thus Alexander's "brutal cutting of the knot... ended an ancient dispensation."&lt;ref&gt;Graves 1960, §83.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The ox-cart suggests a longer voyage, rather than a local journey, perhaps linking Gordias/Midas with an attested origin-myth in Macedon, of which Alexander is most likely to have been aware.&lt;ref&gt;"Surely Alexander believed that this god, who established for Midas the rule over Phrygia, now guaranteed to him the fulfillment of the promise of rule over Asia," (Fredricksmeyer 1961:165).&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the myth, the new dynasty was not immemorially ancient, but had widely remembered origins in a local, but non-priestly "outsider" class, represented by Greek reports equally as an [[eponym]]ous peasant "Gordias"&lt;ref&gt;Trogus ''apud'' Justin, Plutarch, ''Alexander'' 18.1; Curtius 3.1.11 and 14.&lt;/ref&gt; or the locally attested, authentically Phrygian "Midas"&lt;ref&gt;Arrian&lt;/ref&gt; in his ox-cart.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn E. Roller, "Midas and the Gordian Knot", ''Classical Antiquity'' '''3'''.2 (October 1984:256–271) separates out authentic Phrygian elements in the Greek reports and finds a folk-tale element and a religious one, linking the dynastic founder (whether eponymous "Gordias" to Greeks, or Anatolian "Midas") with the cults of "Zeus" and [[Cybele]]. Both Roller and Fredricksmeyer (1961) offer persuasive arguments that the original name associated with the wagon is "Midas", "Gordias" being according to Roller a Greek back-formation from the site, ''Gordion''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] legitimize dynasties by right of conquest (compare [[Cadmus]]), but the legitimising [[oracle]] stressed in this myth suggests that the previous dynasty was a race of priest-kings allied to the unidentified oracle deity.

'''''Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter''''' is a 2011 book by [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Terrence Deacon]]. The book covers topics in [[biosemiotics]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[Abiogenesis|the origins of life]]. Broadly, the book seeks to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistically]] explain "[[aboutness]]", that is, concepts like [[intentionality]], meaning, [[normative|normativity]], purpose, and [[function (biology)|function]]; which Deacon groups together and labels as [[ententional]] phenomena.

==Core Ideas==
Deacon's first book, ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'' focused on the [[Origin of language|evolution of human language]]. In that book, Deacon notes that much of the mystery surrounding language origins comes from a profound confusion on the nature of [[semiotic]] processes themselves. Accordingly, the focus of ''Incomplete Nature'' shifts from [[Human evolution|human origins]] to the [[origin of life]] and [[semiosis]]. ''Incomplete Nature'' can be viewed as a sizable contribution to the growing body of work positing that the problem of [[consciousness]] and the problem of the [[origin of life]] are inexorably linked.&lt;ref&gt;Slanted Truths: Essays on Gaia, Symbiosis and Evolution. Lynn Margulis, Dorion Sagan, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind. Evan Thompson. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Deacon tackles these two linked problems by going back to basics. The book expands upon the classical conceptions of [[work (physics)|work]] and [[information]]  in order to give an account of [[entention]]ality that is consistent with [[eliminative materialism]] and yet does not seek to explain away or pass off as [[Epiphenomenon|epiphenominal]] the non-physical properties of [[life]].

==Constraints==
A central thesis of the book is that absence can still be efficacious. Deacon makes the claim that just as the concept of [[zero]] revolutionized mathematics, thinking about life, mind, and other [[ententional]] phenomena in terms of constraints (i.e., what is absent) can similarly help us overcome the artificial dichotomy of the [[mind body problem]]. A good example of this concept is the hole that defines the hub of a wagon wheel. The hole itself is not a physical thing, but rather a source of constraint that helps to restrict the conformational possibilities of the wheel's components, such that, on a global scale, the property of rolling emerges.  Constraints which produce [[emergence|emergent]] phenomena may not be a process which can be understood by looking at the make-up of the constituents of a pattern. Emergent phenomena are difficult to study because their complexity does not necessarily decompose into parts. When a pattern is broken down, the constraints are no longer at work; there is no hole, no absence to notice. Imagine a hub, a hole for an axle, produced only when the wheel is rolling, thus breaking the wheel may not show you how the hub emerges.

==Orthograde and contragrade==
Deacon notes that the apparent patterns of [[causality]] exhibited by living systems seem to be in some ways the inverse of the causal patterns of non-living systems.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In an attempt to find a solution to the philosophical problems associated with [[teleology|teleological]] explanations, Deacon returns to [[Aristotle's]] [[four causes]] and attempts to modernize them with [[thermodynamic]] concepts.

[[File:Orthograde and contragrade.jpg|450px|A cartoon characterization of the asymmetry implicit in thermodynamic change from a constrained ("ordered") state to a less constrained ("disordered") state, which tends to occur spontaneously (an orthograde process), contrasted with the reversed direction of change, which does not tend to occur spontaneously (a contragrade process), and so only tends to occur in response to the imposition of highly constrained external work (arrows in the image on the right).]]

'''Orthograde''' changes are caused internally. They are spontaneous changes. That is, orthograde changes are generated by the spontaneous elimination of asymmetries in a thermodynamic system in disequilibrium. Because orthograde changes are driven by the internal geometry of a changing system, orthograde causes can be seen as analogous to [[Aristotle's]] [[formal cause]]. More loosely, [[Aristotle's]] [[final cause]] can also be considered orthograde, because goal oriented actions are caused from within.&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contragrade''' changes are imposed from the outside. They are non-spontaneous changes. Contragrade change is induced when one thermodynamic system interacts with the orthograde changes of another thermodynamic system. The interaction drives the first system into a higher energy, more asymmetrical state. Contragrade changes do [[work (physics)|work]]. Because contragrade changes are driven by external interactions with another changing system, contragrade causes can be seen as analogous to [[Aristotle's]] [[efficient cause]].&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homeodynamics, morphodynamics, and teleodynamics==
Much of the book is devoted to expanding upon the ideas of classical [[thermodynamics]], with an extended discussion about how consistently [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|far from equilibrium systems]] can interact and combine to produce novel [[emergence|emergent]] properties. 
[[File:Homomorphoteleo.jpg|thumb|400px]]

Deacon defines three hierarchically nested levels of thermodynamic systems: '''Homeodynamic''' systems combine to produce '''morphodynamic''' systems which combine to produce '''teleodynamic''' systems. Teleodynamic systems can be further combined to produce higher orders of [[self organization]].

===Homeodynamics===
Homeodynamic systems are essentially equivalent to classical [[thermodynamic systems]] like a gas under pressure or solute in solution, but the term serves to emphasize that homeodynamics is an abstract process that can be realized in forms beyond the scope of [[thermodynamics|classic thermodynamics]]. For example, the diffuse brain activity normally associated with emotional states can be considered to be a homeodynamic system because there is a general state of equilibrium which its components (neural activity) distribute towards.&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp.561 "Experience should have clear equilibrium-tending, dissipative, and self-organizing characteristics, besides those that are intentional. These are inseparable dynamical features that literally constitute experience."&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a homeodynamic system is any collection of components that will spontaneously eliminate constraints by rearranging the parts until a maximum [[entropy]] state (disorderliness) is achieved.

===Morphodynamics===
A morphodynamic system consists of a coupling of two homeodynamic systems such that the constraint dissipation of each complements the other, producing macroscopic order out of microscopic interactions. Morphodynamic systems require constant perturbation to maintain their structure, so they are relatively rare in nature. The paradigm example of a morphodynamic system is a [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]]. Other common examples are [[Snowflake#formation|snowflake formation]], [[whirlpools]] and the [[stimulated emission]] of [[laser]] light.

[[File:Benard cell.jpg|thumb|500px|Benard Cell]]
'''Maximum entropy production:''' The organized structure of a morphodynamic system forms to facilitate maximal entropy production. In the case of a [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]], heat at the base of the liquid produces an uneven distribution of high energy molecules which will tend to diffuse towards the surface. As the temperature of the heat source increases, [[density]] effects come into play. Simple [[diffusion]] can no longer dissipate energy as fast as it is added and so the bottom of the liquid becomes hot and more [[buoyant]] than the cooler, denser liquid at the top. The bottom of the liquid begins to rise, and the top begins to sink - producing [[convection]] currents.

'''Two systems:''' The significant heat differential on the liquid produces two homeodynamic systems. The first is a diffusion system, where high energy molecules on the bottom collide with lower energy molecules on the top until the added kinetic energy from the heat source is evenly distributed. The second is a convection system, where the low density fluid on the bottom mixes with the high density fluid on the top until the density becomes evenly distributed. The second system arises when there is too much energy to be effectively dissipated by the first, and once both systems are in place, they will begin to interact.

'''Self organization:''' The convection creates currents in the fluid that disrupt the pattern of heat diffusion from bottom to top. Heat begins to diffuse into the denser areas of current, irrespective of the vertical location of these denser portions of fluid. The areas of the fluid where diffusion is occurring most rapidly will be the most viscous because molecules are rubbing against each other in opposite directions. The convection currents will shun these areas in favor of parts of the fluid where they can flow more easily. And so the fluid spontaneously segregates itself into cells where high energy, low density fluid flows up from the center of the cell and cooler, denser fluid flows down along the edges, with diffusion effects dominating in the area between the center and the edge of each cell.

'''Synergy and constraint:''' What is notable about morphodynamic processes is that order spontaneously emerges explicitly because the ordered system that results is more efficient at increasing entropy than a chaotic one. In the case of the [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]], neither diffusion nor convection on their own will produce as much entropy as both effects coupled together. When both effects are brought into interaction, they constrain each other into a particular geometric form because that form facilitates minimal interference between the two processes. The orderly hexagonal form is stable as long as the energy differential persists, and yet the orderly form more effectively degrades the energy differential than any other form. This is why morphodynamic processes in nature are usually so short lived. They are self organizing, but also self undermining.

===Teleodynamics===
A teleodynamic system consists of coupling two morphodynamic systems such that the self undermining quality of each is constrained by the other. Each system prevents the other from dissipating all of the energy available, and so long term organizational stability is obtained. Deacon claims that we should pinpoint the moment when two morphodynamic systems reciprocally constrain each other as the point when [[ententional]] qualities like [[Function (biology)|function]], [[purpose]] and [[normative|normativity]] emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature pg. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

====Autogenesis====
Deacon explores the properties of teleodynamic systems by describing a chemically plausible model system called an autogen. Deacon emphasizes that the specific autogen he describes is not a proposed description of the first life form, but rather a description of the kinds of thermodynamic synergies that the first living creature likely possessed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24896328 The transition from constraint to regulation at the origin of life.] Frontiers in Bioscience. Terrence W. Deacon, Alok Srivastava, and J. Augustus Bacigalupi&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Autogenesis.jpg|thumb|500px|Autogen pg 339]]

'''Reciprocal catalysis:''' An autogen consists of two self [[Catalysts|catalyzing]] cyclical morphodynamic chemical reactions, similar to a [[chemoton]]. In one reaction, organic molecules react in a looped series, the products of one reaction becoming the reactants for the next. This looped reaction is self amplifying, producing more and more reactants until all the substrate is consumed. A side product of this reciprocally catalytic loop is a [[lipid]] that can be used as a reactant in a second reaction. This second reaction creates a boundary (either a [[microtubule]] or some other closed [[capsid]] like structure), that serves to contain the first reaction. The boundary limits [[diffusion]]; it keeps all of the necessary [[catalysts]] in close proximity to each other. In addition, the boundary prevents the first reaction from completely consuming all of the available substrate in the environment.

'''The first self:''' Unlike an isolated morphodynamic process whose organization rapidly eliminates the energy gradient necessary to maintain its structure, a teleodynamic process is self-limiting and self preserving. The two reactions complement each other, and ensure that neither ever runs to equilibrium - that is completion, cessation, and [[death]]. So, in a teleodynamic system there will be structures that embody a preliminary sketch of a [[biological function]]. The internal reaction network functions to create the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] for the boundary reaction, and the boundary reaction functions to protect and constrain the internal reaction network. Either process in isolation would be [[abiotic]] but together they create a system with a [[normative]] status dependent on the functioning of its component parts.

&lt;!--
======Autogenesis and Autopoesis======
Deacon's model of an autogen bears a striking resemblance to the [[autopoesis|autopoetic]] theory proposed by [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela|Fransisco Varela]] in 1973. However, Deacon takes pains to differentiate teleodynamics from autopoesis.

Deacon notes that autopoiesis is an update on the [[Kantian]] reciprocal production of parts conception of organisms. The problem with this approach is that is assumes the two most critical features necessary for life (and teleodynamics): (1) how the network of co-producing components is maintained as a "unity" in such a way that its coherent organization can be reconstituted or reproduced in a new system, and (2) how this unit "self" maintains itself far-from-equilibrium. [[Autopoiesis]] is an abstract description of what must be true of an organism, without outlining how these defining properties are accomplished. Indeed, as stated, [[autopoiesis]] describes morphodynamic processes, though without an account of the thermodyanamics involved. But morphodynamic processes don't spontaneously hold together, indeed, they are organized in a way that maximally destroys the conditions that produce them because they are entirely driven by extrinsic dynamics. Essentially, [[autopoesis]] is a description of the processes defining life, while autogenesis describes how they are dynamically achieved.&lt;ref&gt;The transition from constraint to regulation at the origin of life.

--&gt;

==Work==
As with other concepts in the book, in his discussion of [[work (physics)|work]] Deacon seeks to generalize the [[Newtonian mechanics#Work and energy|Newtonian]] conception of work such that the term can be used to describe and differentiate mental phenomena - to describe "that which makes daydreaming effortless but metabolically equivalent problem solving difficult."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg.365&lt;/ref&gt;  Work is generally described as "activity that is necessary to overcome resistance to change. Resistance can be either active or passive, and so work can be directed towards enacting change that wouldn't otherwise occur or preventing change that would happen in its absence."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; Using the terminology developed earlier in the book, work can be considered to be "the organization of differences between orthograde processes such that a locus of contragrade process is created. Or, more simply, work is a spontaneous change inducing a non-spontaneous change to occur."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg.371&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermodynamic work===

A thermodynamic systems capacity to do work depends less upon the total energy of the system and more upon the geometric distribution of its components. A glass of water at 20 degrees Celsius will have the same amount of energy as a glass divided in half with the top [[fluid]] at 30 degrees and the bottom at 10, but only in the second glass will the top half have the capacity to do work upon the bottom. This is because work occurs at both [[macroscopic]] and [[microscopic]] levels. Microscopically, there is constant work being performed on one molecule by another when they collide. But the potential for this microscopic work to additively sum to macroscopic work depends on there being an asymmetric distribution of particle speeds, so that the average collision pushes in a focused direction. Microscopic work is [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary but not sufficient]] for macroscopic work. A global property of asymmetric distribution is also required.

===Morphodynamic work===

By recognizing that asymmetry is a general property of work - that work is done as asymmetric systems spontaneously tend towards symmetry, Deacon abstracts the concept of work and applies it to systems whose symmetries are vastly more complex than those covered by [[classical thermodynamics]]. In a morphodynamic system, the tendency towards symmetry produces not global [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]], but a complex geometric form like a hexagonal [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Benard cell]] or the [[resonant frequency]] of a flute. This tendency towards convolutedly symmetric forms can be harnessed to do [[work (physics)|work]] on other morphodynamic systems, if the systems are properly coupled.

'''Resonance example:''' A good example of morphodynamic work is the induced [[resonance]] that can be observed by singing or playing a flute next to a string instrument like a harp or guitar. The vibrating air emitted from the flute will interact with the taut strings. If any of the strings are tuned to a [[resonant frequency]] that matches the note being played, they too will begin to vibrate and emit sound.

'''Contragrade change:''' When energy is added to the flute by blowing air into it, there is a spontaneous (orthograde) tendency for the system to dissipate the added energy by inducing the air within the flute to vibrate at a specific frequency. This orthograde morphodynamic form generation can be used to induce contragrade change in the system coupled to it - the taught string. Playing the flute does work on the string by causing it to enter a high energy state that could not be reached spontaneously in an uncoupled state.

'''Structure and form:''' Importantly, this is not just the macro scale propagation of random micro vibrations from one system to another. The global geometric structure of the system is essential. The total energy transferred from the flute to the string matters far less than the patterns it takes in transit. That is, the [[amplitude]] of the coupled note is irrelevant, what matters is its [[frequency]]. Notes that have a higher or lower frequency than the resonant frequency of the string will not be able to do morphodynamic work.

===Teleodynamic work===

Work is generally defined to be the interaction of two orthograde changing systems such that contragrade change is produced.&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; In teleodynamic systems, the spontaneous orthograde tendency is not to equilibriate (as in homeodynamic systems), nor to self simplify (as in morphodynamic systems) but rather to tend towards self-preservation. Living organisms spontaneously tend to [[Healing|heal]], to [[Reproduction|reproduce]] and to pursue resources towards these ends.  Teleodynamic work acts on these tendencies and pushes them in a contragrade, non-spontaneous direction. 
[[File:Reading 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Reading exemplifies the logic of teleodynamic work. A passive source of cognitive constraints is potentially provided by the letterforms on a page. A literate person has structured his or her sensory and cognitive habits to use such letterforms to reorganize the neural activities constituting thinking. This enables us to do teleodynamic work to shift mental tendencies away from those that are spontaneous (such as daydreaming) to those that are constrained by the text. Artist: [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]] (1682–1754).]]

'''Evolution as work:''' [[Natural selection]], or perhaps more accurately, [[adaptation]], can be considered to be a ubiquitous form of teleodynamic work. The othograde self-preservation and reproduction tendencies of individual organisms tends to undermine those same tendencies in conspecifics. This competition produces a constraint that tends to mold organisms into forms that are more adapted to their environments – forms that would otherwise not spontaneously persist.

For example, in a population of New Zealand [[wrybill]] who make a living by searching for grubs under rocks, those that have a bent beak gain access to more calories. Those with bent beaks are able to better provide for their young, and at the same time they remove a disproportionate quantity of grubs from their environment, making it more difficult for those with straight beaks to provide for their own young. Throughout their lives, all the [[wrybill]]s in the population do work to structure the form of the next generation. The increased efficiency of the bent beak causes that morphology to dominate the next generation. Thus an asymmetry of beak shape distribution is produced in the population - an asymmetry produced by teleodynamic work.

'''Thought as work:''' Mental problem solving can also be considered teleodynamic work. Thought forms are spontaneously generated, and task of problem solving is the task of molding those forms to fit the context of the problem at hand. Deacon makes the link between evolution as teleodynamic work and thought as teleodynamic work explicit. "The experience of being sentient is what it feels like to ''be'' evolution."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg 550&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emergent causal powers====

By conceiving of work in this way, Deacon claims "we can begin to discern ''a basis for a form of causal openness'' in the universe."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg.379&lt;/ref&gt; While increases in complexity in no way alter the laws of physics, by juxtaposing systems together, pathways of spontaneous change can be made available that were inconceivably improbable prior to the systems coupling. The causal power of any complex living system lies not solely in the underlying [[quantum mechanics]] but also in the global arrangement of its components. A careful arrangement of parts can constrain possibilities such that phenomena that were formerly impossibly rare can become improbably common.

==Information==
One of the central purposes of Incomplete Nature is to articulate a theory of biological [[information]]. The first formal [[Information Theory|theory of information]] was articulated by [[Claude E. Shannon|Claude Shannon]] in 1948 in his work [[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]. Shannon's work is widely credited with ushering in the [[information age]], but somewhat paradoxically, it was completely silent on questions of [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and [[reference]], i.e., what the information is ''about.'' As an engineer, Shannon was concerned with the challenge of reliably transmitting a message from one location to another. The meaning and content of the message was largely irrelevant. So, while Shannon information theory has been essential for the development of devices like [[computers]], it has left open many philosophical questions regarding the nature of information. Incomplete Nature seeks to answer some of these questions.

===Shannon information===
Shannon's key insight was to recognize a link between [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] and [[information]]. [[Entropy]] is often defined as a measurement of disorder, or randomness, but this can be misleading. For Shannon's purposes, the entropy of a system is the number of possible states that the system has the capacity to be in. Any one of these potential states can constitute a message. For example, a typewritten page can bear as many different messages as there are different combinations of characters that can be arranged on the page. The information content of a message can only be understood against the background context of all of the messages that could have been sent, but weren't. Information is produced by a reduction of entropy in the message medium. 
[[File:Information Shannon Boltzmann Darwin.jpg|thumb|500px|Three nested conceptions of information]]

===Boltzmann entropy===
Shannon's information based conception of entropy should be distinguished from the more classic [[thermodynamic]] conception of entropy developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and others at the end of the nineteenth century. While Shannon entropy is static and has to do with the set of all possible messages/states that a signal bearing system might take, Boltzmann entropy has to do with the tendency of all dynamic systems to tend towards equilibrium. That is, there are many more ways for a collection of particles to be well mixed than to be segregated based on velocity, mass, or any other property. Boltzmann entropy is central to the theory of work developed earlier in the book because entropy dictates the direction in which a system will spontaneously tend.

===Significant information===
Deacon's addition to Shannon information theory is to propose a method for describing not just how a message is transmitted, but also how it is interpreted. Deacon weaves together Shannon entropy and Boltzmann entropy in order to develop a theory of interpretation based in teleodynamic work. Interpretation is inherently normative. Data becomes information when it has significance for its interpreter. Thus interpretive systems are teleodynamic - the interpretive process is designed to perpetuate itself. "The interpretation of something as information indirectly reinforces the capacity to do this again."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kasner metric''' (developed by and named for the American mathematician [[Edward Kasner]] in 1921)&lt;ref&gt;Kasner, E. "Geometrical theorems on Einstein’s cosmological equations." ''Am. J. Math.'' '''43''', 217–221 (1921).&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solution]] to [[Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]].  It describes an anisotropic [[universe]] without [[matter]] (i.e., it is a [[vacuum solution]]).  It can be written in any [[spacetime]] [[dimension]] &lt;math&gt;D&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; and has strong connections with the study of gravitational [[Chaos theory|chaos]].

== Metric and conditions ==

The [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] in &lt;math&gt;D&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; spacetime dimensions is

:&lt;math&gt;\text{d}s^2 = -\text{d}t^2 + \sum_{j=1}^{D-1} t^{2p_j} [\text{d}x^j]^2&lt;/math&gt;,

and contains &lt;math&gt;D-1&lt;/math&gt; constants &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt;, called the ''Kasner exponents.''  The metric describes a spacetime whose equal-time slices are spatially flat, however space is expanding or contracting at different rates in different directions, depending on the values of the &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt;.  Test particles in this metric whose comoving coordinate differs by &lt;math&gt;\Delta x^j&lt;/math&gt; are separated by a physical distance &lt;math&gt;t^{p_j}\Delta x^j&lt;/math&gt;.

The Kasner metric is an exact solution to Einstein's equations in vacuum when the Kasner exponents satisfy the following ''Kasner conditions,''

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^{D-1} p_j = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^{D-1} p_j^2 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The first condition defines a [[plane (geometry)|plane]], the ''Kasner plane,'' and the second describes a [[sphere]], the ''Kasner sphere.''  The solutions (choices of &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt;) satisfying the two conditions therefore lie on the sphere where the two intersect (sometimes confusingly also called the Kasner sphere).  In &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; spacetime dimensions, the space of solutions therefore lie on a &lt;math&gt;D-3&lt;/math&gt; dimensional sphere &lt;math&gt;S^{D-3}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Features ==

There are several noticeable and unusual features of the Kasner solution:

*The volume of the spatial slices is always &lt;math&gt;O(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  This is because their volume is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-g}&lt;/math&gt;, and

::&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-g} = t^{p_1 + p_2 + \cdots + p_{D-1}} = t&lt;/math&gt;

:where we have used the first Kasner condition.  Therefore &lt;math&gt;t\to 0&lt;/math&gt; can describe either a [[Big Bang]] or a [[Big Crunch]], depending on the sense of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;

*[[Isotropic]] [[metric expansion of space|expansion or contraction of space]] is not allowed.  If the spatial slices were expanding isotropically, then all of the Kasner exponents must be equal, and therefore &lt;math&gt;p_j = 1/(D-1)&lt;/math&gt; to satisfy the first Kasner condition.  But then the second Kasner condition cannot be satisfied, for

::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^{D-1} p_j^2 = \frac{1}{D-1} \ne 1.&lt;/math&gt;

:The [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] employed in [[cosmology]], by contrast, is able to expand or contract isotropically because of the presence of matter.

*With a little more work, one can show that at least one Kasner exponent is always negative (unless we are at one of the solutions with a single &lt;math&gt;p_j=1&lt;/math&gt;, and the rest vanishing).  Suppose we take the time coordinate &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to increase from zero.  Then this implies that while the volume of space is increasing like &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, at least one direction (corresponding to the negative Kasner exponent) is actually ''contracting.''
*The Kasner metric is a solution to the vacuum Einstein equations, and so the [[Ricci tensor]] always vanishes for any choice of exponents satisfying the Kasner conditions.  The full [[Riemann tensor]] vanishes only when a single &lt;math&gt;p_j=1&lt;/math&gt; and the rest vanish, in which case the space is flat. The Minkowski metric can be recovered via the coordinate transformation &lt;math&gt;t' = t \cosh x_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_j' = t \sinh x_j&lt;/math&gt;.

The first part of this section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains those mass murders where the perpetrators predominantly targeted their (former) co-workers, while the second part focuses on cases where soldiers willfully killed their own comrades.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator(s) shall not be counted among those killed or injured.

All abbreviations used in the tables are explained [[#Abbreviations and footnotes|below]].

The '''live streaming of crimes''' is a phenomenon arising in the 2010s in which criminals deliberately commit crimes while [[live stream]]ing the act on [[social media]]. Due to the act being published to social media for others to see, it is often impossible to protect the privacy of the victims of these crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Live-streaming crime How will Facebook Live and Periscope challenge US privacy law? |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160803140150.htm |access-date=27 January 2017 |work=[[Science Daily]] |date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D.

== History ==

In April 2016, Marina Lonina (18) and Raymond Gates (29) were arrested in Ohio on charges that Gates raped an underage friend of Marina's while Lonina [[live-streamed]] the crime on [[Periscope (app)|Periscope]].&lt;ref name="McPhteLive"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prosecutor pointed out that Lonina, who was taken advantage of by a much older man, had gotten "caught up" in her excitement over the number of "likes" she was getting, and is shown on screen "laughing and giggling."&lt;ref name="McPhteLive" /&gt;  Joss Wright of the [[Oxford Internet Institute]] pointed out that "[given the] volume of content being created and uploaded every day [ . . . there] is almost no practical way to prevent content like this being uploaded and shared."&lt;ref name="PeriscopeRape" /&gt;

By May ''[[The New York Times]]'' was including the Ohio Periscope rape as one of a series of recent cases in which crimes were live streamed, including one in which a young woman in [[Égly]], France speaks via Periscope about her distress and suicidal thoughts and is apparently encouraged by viewers to kill herself, which she does by throwing herself under a train, and the case of two teenagers who live stream themselves bragging and laughing as they beat up a drunken man in a bar in [[Bordeaux, France]].&lt;ref name="Blaise"&gt;{{cite news

'''Map symbolization''' is the [[character (symbol)|character]]s, [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s, or similar [[graphic]] representations used on a [[map]] to indicate an object or characteristic in the real world.

==Cognitive issues==
In [[cartography]], the principles of [[cognition]] are important since they explain why certain map symbols work.&lt;ref name="olson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=J. M.|year=1979|title=Cognitive Cartographic Experimentation|journal=The Canadian Cartographer|volume=16|pages=34-44|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, mapmakers did not care why they worked. This [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] view treats the human brain like a black box.  Modern cartographers are curious why certain symbols are the most effective. This should help develop a theoretical basis for how brains recognize [[symbols]] and, in turn, provide a platform for creating new symbols.

==Topographic maps==
[[Topographic map]]s show the shape of Earth’s surface by using [[contour line]]s, the lines on the map that join points of equal elevation. They are among the most well-known symbols on modern maps as they are self-explanatory and accurately represent their phenomena. They make it possible to the depict height, depth, and even [[slope]]. Contour lines will be closer together or spaced apart to show the steepness of the area. If the line is spaced closer together, it means that there is a steeper slope. If they are farther apart, the area has a low slope. An area of low slope generally uses [[contour interval]]s of 10 feet or less. Areas that contain mountain or other high slope can use an interval of 100 feet.&lt;ref name=topographic&gt;{{cite web |title= Topographic Map Symbols |year= April 28, 2005 |accessdate= May 4, 2011 |publisher= U.S. Geological Survey |url= http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/symbols/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from showing just [[contour lines]], [[topographic maps]] also use a lot of map symbols to represent its features. Features are represented by using point, line, and area symbols. Individual features, such as houses, are shown as point symbols like a small dot or square. However, a cluster of houses or neighborhood can be shown as a shaded area or polygon. Areas of importance or [[landmarks]] may receive special symbols that represent what they are. For instance, a [[Church (building)|church]] may be symbolized as a picture of a little church or [[cross]] or the [[town hall]] may have a special color or symbol.

==Shape and color of topographic symbols==
Many of the symbol feature on maps of the earth will be shown by straight, curved, dashed, or solid lines. They may also be colored to represent different classes of information. The typical color standard for topographic maps depicts contours in brown, bodies of water in blue, boundaries in black, and grids and roads in red. Topographic maps may use different colors to represent [[Geographical feature|area features]]. Most topographic maps will use green for vegetation or national parks and wildlife management areas. They will also use blue for rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water. Red may also be used to represent areas of significant importance.&lt;ref name=topographic /&gt;

A map is a smaller representation of an area on the earth’s surface; therefore, map symbols are used to represent real objects. Without symbols, maps would not be possible.&lt;ref name=symbols /&gt; Both shapes and colors can be used for symbols on maps. A small circle may mean a point of interest, with a brown circle meaning [[recreation]], red circle meaning services, and green circle meaning rest stop. Colors may cover larger areas of a map, such as green representing forested land and blue representing waterways. To ensure that a person can correctly read a map, a map legend{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} is a key to all the symbols used on a map. It is like a dictionary so you can understand the meaning of what the map represents/&lt;ref name=symbols&gt;{{cite web |title= Map Symbols |date= n.d. |accessdate= May 4, 2011 |work= Compass Dude |url=  http://www.compassdude.com/map-symbols.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules to follow==
There are certain rules to follow with map symbols. The representative symbols should always be placed on the left and defined to the right. This allows for the reader to view the symbol first, then its definition, which is customary in English dictionaries. In most cases, representative symbols should be vertically displayed and the symbols should be horizontally centred. The symbols should be vertically centred with the definitions. The definitions are supposed to be horizontally centred to the left.

==Representing spatial phenomena==
Symbols are used to represent geographic phenomena. Most phenomena can be represented by using point, line, or area symbols.&lt;ref name=krygier&gt;{{cite book |last1= Krygier |first1= J. |last2= Wood |first2= D. |lastauthoramp =yes |year= 2005 |title= Making Maps: A Visual Guide to Map Design for GIS |location= New York |publisher= Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary to consider the spatial arrangement of the phenomena to determine what kind of symbolization it will require. Discrete phenomena occur at isolated points, whereas continuous phenomena occur everywhere. Both of these can also be broken down into either smooth or abrupt. For example, rainfall and taxes for states are both continuous in nature, but rainfall is smooth because it does not vary at state boundaries, leaving the tax to be considered abrupt. It is important to distinguish between real world and the data we use to represent it.
There are basically five types of spatial dimensions that are used to classify phenomena for map symbolization. Point phenomena are assumed to have no spatial extent and are said to be zero-dimensional. These use point symbols on a map to indicate their location. An example of these would be fire hydrants or trees in a park. Linear phenomena are one-dimensional and have a length. This would include any line feature on a map like roads or sidewalks. Areal phenomena are 2-D that has both a length and a width.  The best example of this would be a lake or other body of water. When volume comes into consideration, it is broken down into two types, 2 ½ dimensions and 3-D. A good example of 2 ½ D would be the elevation of a place above sea level, while 3-D being any three-dimensional objects.

==Ranking==
An important factor in map symbols is the order in which they are ranked according to their relative importance. This is known as intellectual hierarchy. The most important hierarchy is the thematic symbols and type labels that are directly related to the theme. Next comes the title, subtitle, and [[Legend_(map)#Map_symbology|legend]].&lt;ref name=krygier /&gt; The map must also contain base information, such as boundaries, roads, and place names. Data source and notes should be on all maps. Lastly, the scale, neat lines, and north arrow are the least important of the hierarchy of the map. From this we see that the symbols are the single most important thing to build a good [[visual hierarchy]] that shows proper graphical representation. When producing a map with good visual hierarchy, thematic symbols should be graphically emphasized. A map with a visual hierarchy that is effective attracts the map user’s eyes to the symbols with the most important aspects of the map first and to the symbols with the lesser importance later.

The legend of the map also contains important information and all of the thematic symbols of the map. Symbol that need no explanation, or do not coincide with the theme of the map, are normally omitted from the map legend. Thematic symbols directly represent the maps theme and should stand out.&lt;ref name=symbols /&gt;

==Choropleth maps==
[[Choropleth map]]ping is commonly used to show data for counties, states, or other enumeration units. Data collected for choropleth maps is usually grouped into separate classes based on attributes or other forms of classification. The classes are given a specific color or shading based on their values and what they are trying to portray. Choropleth maps are most effective when the data or classes change abruptly at each enumerated boundary.&lt;ref name=slocum&gt;{{cite book |last1= Slocum |first1= T. A. |last2= McMaster |first2= R. B. |last3= Kessler |first3= F. C.  |last4= Howard |first4= H. H.  |lastauthoramp =yes |year= 2005 |title= Thematic Cartography and Geographic Visualization |location= Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher= Pearson Prentice Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proportional symbol map is better than choropleth maps for showing raw data totals. A proportional symbols map uses symbols that are proportional to the data that they are representing with point locations. These symbols can be true points or conceptual points. True points represent real objects or the exact location of a tangible object. This could be an oil well or fire hydrant. A conceptual point represents the center of the [[Enumeration|enumeration unit]], such as a corn field. The raw data on proportional symbol maps go hand in hand with the data shown on choropleth maps.&lt;ref name=slocum /&gt;

==Isopleth maps==
Isopleth maps use [[Contour_line#Isopleths|isolines]] that connect points of equal values. A good example of isolines is connecting areas with similar temperatures. As with choropleth maps, Isopleth maps require standardized data to be appropriately contoured.

==Dot maps==
[[Dot distribution map|Dot maps]] use one single dot to represent where a single phenomenon is the most likely to occur. The total amount of dots can cover a single area or multiple areas. The [[density]] of the dots is interpreted by the user as areas of high value. This method is more accurate than proportional and Isopleth maps.&lt;ref name=slocum /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3805">In [[economics]], '''marginal concepts''' are associated with a ''specific change'' in the quantity used of a [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]], as opposed to some notion of the over-all significance of that class of good or service, or of some total quantity thereof.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== Marginality ==

Constraints are conceptualized as a ''border'' or ''margin''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910), Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;  The location of the margin for any individual corresponds to his or her ''endowment'', broadly conceived to include opportunities.  This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made both by others and by the individual himself or herself.

A value that holds true given particular constraints is a [[marginal value|''marginal'' value]].  A change that would be affected as or by a specific loosening or tightening of those constraints is a ''marginal'' change, as large as the smallest relevant division of that good or service.&lt;ref name="wieser_ein"&gt;von Wieser, Friedrich; ''Über den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  For reasons of tractability, it is often assumed in [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical analysis]] that goods and services are [[Continuum (theory)|continuously divisible]].  In such context, a marginal change may be an [[infinitesimal]] change or a [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]].  However, strictly speaking, the smallest relevant division may be quite large.

== Some important marginal concepts ==

The '''[[marginal use]]''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the good or service that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.&lt;ref name="wieser_ein" /&gt;

The '''[[marginal utility]]''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the [[utility]] of the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase in that good or service, or of the specific use that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.  In other words, marginal utility is the utility of the  [[marginal use]].

The '''[[marginal rate of substitution]]''' is the rate of substitution is the least favorable rate, at the margin, at which an agent is willing to exchange units of one good or service for units of another.

A '''[[marginal benefit]]''' is a benefit (howsoever ranked or measured) associated with a marginal change.

The term “'''[[marginal cost]]'''” may refer to an [[opportunity cost]] at the margin, or to marginal ''[[Money|pecuniary]]'' cost — that is to say marginal cost measured by forgone money.

Other marginal concepts include (but are not limited to):
* [[marginal product|marginal physical product]] (sometimes also known as “marginal product”)
* [[marginal rate of transformation]], the rate at which one output or result must be sacrificed in order to increase another output or result
* [[marginal revenue product]]
* [[marginal propensity to save]] and [[marginal propensity to consume|consume]]
* [[marginal tax rate]]

'''[[Marginalism]]''' is the use of marginal concepts to explain economic phenomena.

The related concept of [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] is the ratio of the incremental percentage change in one variable with respect to an incremental percentage change in another variable.

'''Mental factors''' ({{lang-sa|caitasika}}; {{lang-pi|cetasika}}; Tibetan Wylie: ''sems byung''), in [[Buddhism]], are identified within the teachings of the [[Abhidhamma]] (Buddhist psychology). They are defined as aspects of the mind that apprehend the quality of an object, and that have the ability to color the mind. Within the Abhidhamma, the mental factors are categorized as formations ({{lang-sa|saṅkhāra}}) concurrent with mind ({{lang-sa|citta}}).&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Location 321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geshe Tashi Tsering 2006"&gt;Geshe Tashi Tsering (2006), Kindle Location 456.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternate translations for mental factors include "mental states", "mental events", and "concomitants of consciousness".

==Introduction==
Mental factors are aspects of the mind that apprehend the quality of an object and have the ability to color the mind. Geshe Tashi Tsering explains:
:The Tibetan for mental factors, ''semlay jungwa chö'' (Skt. ''chaitasika dharma''), means phenomena arising from the mind, suggesting that the mental factors are not primary to the mind but arise within a larger framework. A mental factor, again, is defined as the aspect of the mind that apprehends a particular quality of an object. Because it is characterized by the qualities of activity and non-neutrality, it has the ability to color the mind in dependence on the way it manifests. Hence, a feeling of desire from seeing what is conceived as a beautiful object affects the other mental factors that are present at that time, and this colors the whole mind.&lt;ref&gt;Geshe Tashi Tsering (2006), Kindle Locations 564-568.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the main mind (Sanskrit: [[citta]]) and the mental factors can be described by the following metaphors:
* The main mind is like screen in a cinema, and the mental factors are like the images projected on the screen. In this analogy, we typically do not notice the screen because we are so caught up on the images.
* The main mind is like a king who sits passively on a throne, and the mental factors are like the king's busy ministers.&lt;ref name="Geshe Tashi Tsering 2006"/&gt;

Traleg Rinpoche states that the main distinction between the mind and mental factors is that the mind apprehends an object as a whole, whereas mental factors apprehend an object in its particulars.&lt;ref name=traleg1&gt;Traleg Rinpoche (1993). p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Traleg Rinpoche states: "The fundamental distinction made in Yogacara philosophy between the mind and mental events is that the mind apprehends an object as a whole, whereas mental events apprehend an object in its particulars. If we perceive a table, then the perception of the table itself would be related to the mind, whereas the particular characteristics of that table would be the object of perception for the mental events. First, we have an immediate perception of the table. After that, we have certain feeling-tones, certain judgments, involved with that particular perception. Those things are related to the mental events. The immediate perception is the only thing related to the mind. That seems to be the major distinction between the mind and the mental events."&lt;ref name=traleg1/&gt;}}

==Lists of mental factors==
Within Buddhism, there are many different systems of [[abhidharma]] (commonly referred to as Buddhist psychology), and each system contains its own list of the most significant mental factors.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Alexander Berzin states: "There are many different systems of abhidharma (chos-mngon-pa, topics of knowledge), each with its individual count and list of subsidiary awarenesses. Often, the definitions of the awarenesses they assert in common differ as well."&lt;ref name=berzin1&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/science-of-mind/mind-mental-factors/primary-minds-and-the-51-mental-factors ''Primary Minds and the 51 Mental Factors'' by Alexander Berzin] (see section "Count of the Mental Factors")&lt;/ref&gt; }}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Bikkhu Bodhi states: "A second distinguishing feature of the Abhidhamma is the dissection of the apparently continuous stream of consciousness into a succession of discrete evanescent cognitive events called cittas, each a complex unity involving consciousness itself, as the basic awareness of an object, and a constellation of mental factors (cetasika) exercising more specialized tasks in the act of cognition. Such a view of consciousness, at least in outline, can readily be derived from the Sutta Pitaka's analysis of experience into the five aggregates, among which the four mental aggregates are always inseparably conjoined, but the conception remains there merely suggestive. In the Abhidhamma Pitaka the suggestion is not simply picked up, but is expanded into an extraordinarily detailed and coherent picture of the functioning of consciousness both in its microscopic immediacy and in its extended continuity from life to life."&lt;ref name=bhodhi1&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/abhiman.html ''A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} These lists vary from system to system both in the number of mental factors listed, and in the definitions that are given for each mental factor. These lists are not considered to be exhaustive; rather they present significant categories and mental factors that are useful to study in order to understand how the mind functions.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The lists of mental factors are not considered to be exhaustive. For example:
* The Dalai Lama states: “Whether the system includes fifty-one mental factors or more or less, none of those sets is meant to be all-inclusive, as though nothing is left out. They are only suggestive, indicative of some things that are important.”{{sfn|Goleman|2008|loc=Kindle Locations 3628-3631}}
* Alexander Berzin states: "These lists of subsidiary awarenesses are not exhaustive. There are many more than just fifty-one. Many good qualities (yon-tan) cultivated on the Buddhist path are not listed separately – for example, generosity (sbyin-pa), ethical discipline (tshul-khrims), patience (bzod-pa), love (byams-pa), and compassion (snying-rje). According to the Gelug presentation, the five types of deep awareness (ye-shes) – mirror-like, equalizing, individualizing, accomplishing, and sphere of reality (Skt. dharmadhatu) – are also subsidiary awarenesses. The various lists are just of certain significant categories of subsidiary awarenesses."&lt;ref name=berzin1/&gt;}}

Some of the main commentaries on the Abhidharma systems that are studied today include:&lt;ref name=berzin1/&gt;
* ''[[Abhidhammattha-sangaha]]'' by Acariya Anuruddha - a [[Theravada]] commentary that lists fifty-two mental factors.
* ''[[Atthasālinī]]'' by [[Buddhaghosa]] - a Theravada commentary that provides explanations for fifty-two mental factors
* ''[[Abhidharma-kosha]]'' by [[Vasubandhu]] - a [[Sarvastivada]] commentary (studied by the Mahayana schools) that lists forty-six mental factors.
* ''[[Abhidharma-samuccaya]]'' by [[Asanga]] - a [[Yogachara]] commentary (studied by the Mahayana schools) that lists fifty-one mental factors.
* ''Innermost Core of Topics of Knowledge (mDzod-phug)'' by [[Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche|Shenrab Miwo]] - a Tibetan [[Bon]] commentary that lists fifty-one factors.

==Sthaviravāda Sarvastivada tradition==
In [[Mahavibhasa]] and [[Abhidharma-kosa]], 46 mental factors have been listed as below:
===Ten mahā-bhūmika===
The ten mahā-bhūmika are common to all consciousness.
* ''[[Vedanā]]'' - feeling
* ''[[Saññā]]'' - perception
* ''[[Cetanā]]'' - volition

* ''[[Chanda (Buddhism)|Chanda]]'' - desire (to act)
* ''[[Paññā]]'' - wisdom
* ''[[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|Sati]]'' - mindfulness
* ''[[Manasikāra]]'' - attention
* ''[[Adhimokkha]]'' - decision
* ''[[Samadhi (Buddhism)|Samādhi]]'' - mental concentration. it also called [[Ekaggata]], one-pointedness

===Ten kuśala-mahā-bhūmikādharmāḥ===
The ten kuśala-mahā-bhūmikādharmāḥ accompany the wholesome consciousnesses (kusala citta).
* ''[[Saddhā|Sraddhā]]'' - faith
* ''[[Vīrya]]'' - energy
* ''[[Hiri (Buddhism)|Hiri]]'' - shame at doing evil
* ''[[Apatrāpya]]'' - decorum, regard for consequence
* ''[[Alobha]]'' - non-attachment
* ''[[Advesha]]'' - non-aggression
* ''[[Passaddhi]]'' - calmness
* ''[[Upekkha]]'' - equanimty
* ''[[Apramada]]'' - conscientiousness
* ''[[Ahimsa]]'' - non-injuriousness

===Six kleśa-mahā-bhūmika===
These six one would accompany with [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleśa]].
* ''[[Moha (Buddhism)|Moha]]'' - delusion
* ''[[Pramāda]]'' - heedlessness, carelessness, unconcern
* ''[[Kausīdya]]'' - laziness, slothfulness
* ''[[Āśraddhya]]'' - lack of faith, lack of trust
* ''[[Styāna]]'' - lethargy, gloominess
* ''[[Auddhatya]]'' - excitement, ebullience

==Theravāda Abhidharma tradition==
Within the Theravāda tradition, the [[Abhidhammattha-sangaha]] enumerates the fifty-two mental factors listed below:{{refn|group=lower-alpha|These fifty-two mental states are enumerated and defined in chapter 2 of the ''[[Abhidhammattha-sangaha]]''. See: 
* [http://www.palikanon.com/english/sangaha/chapter_2.htm Abhidhammattha-sangaha (Chapter 2)] translated by Nārada Thera, et al.&lt;ref name=thera1&gt;[http://www.palikanon.com/english/sangaha/sangaha.htm ''Abhidhammattha-sangaha'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/mendis/wheel322.html#cetasika The Abhidhamma in Practice: The Cetasikas]}}

Note that this list is not exhaustive; there are other mental factors mentioned in the Theravada teachings. This list identifies fifty-two important factors that help to understand how the mind functions.

===Seven universal mental factors===
The seven universal mental factors (''sabbacittasādhāraṇa cetasikas'') are common (''sādhāraṇa'') to all consciousness (''sabbacitta''). [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] states: "These factors perform the most rudimentary and essential cognitive functions, without which consciousness of an object would be utterly impossible."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2140-2142}}

These seven factors are:
* ''[[Phassa]]'' - contact 
* ''[[Vedanā]]'' - feeling
* ''[[Saññā]]'' - perception
* ''[[Cetanā]]'' - volition
* ''[[Ekaggata]]'' - one-pointedness
* ''[[Jīvitindriya]]'' - life faculty
* ''[[Manasikāra]]'' - attention

===Six occasional mental factors===
The six occasional or particular mental factors (''pakiṇṇaka cetasikas'') are ethically variable mental factors found only in certain consciousnesses.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2232-2234}} They are:
* ''[[Vitakka]]'' - Application of thought
* ''[[Vicāra]]'' - Examining
* ''[[Adhimokkha]]'' - Decision
* ''[[Viriya]]'' - Energy
* ''[[Pīti]]'' - Rapture
* ''[[Chanda (Buddhism)|Chanda]]'' - Desire (to act)

===Fourteen unwholesome mental factors===
The unwholesome mental factors (''akusala cetasikas'') accompany the unwholesome consciousnesses (''akusala citta'').

Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 1320-1324}}
:Unwholesome consciousness (''akusalacitta'') is consciousness accompanied by one or another of the three unwholesome roots—greed, hatred, and delusion. Such consciousness is called unwholesome because it is mentally unhealthy, morally blameworthy, and productive of painful results. 

The fourteen unwholesome mental factors are:
* Four universal unwholesome mental factors (''akusalasādhāraṇa''):
** ''[[Moha (Buddhism)|Moha]]'' - delusion 
** ''[[Ahirika]]'' - lack of shame
** ''[[Anottappa]]'' - disregard for consequence
** ''[[Uddhacca]]'' - restlessness
* Three mental factors of the greed-group (''lobha''):
** ''[[Raga (Buddhism)|Lobha]]'' - greed
** ''[[View (Buddhism)|Diṭṭhi]]'' - wrong view
** ''[[Māna]]'' - conceit
* Four mental factors of the hatred-group (''dosa'')
** ''[[Dvesha (Buddhism)|Dosa]]'' - hatred
** ''[[Issā]]'' - envy
** ''[[Macchariya]]'' - miserliness
** ''[[Kukkucca]]'' - regret
* Other unwholesome mental factors
** ''[[Thīna]]'' - sloth
** ''[[Middha]]'' - torpor
** ''[[Vicikicchā]]'' - doubt

===Twenty-five beautiful mental factors===
The beautiful mental factors (''sobhana cetasikas'') accompany the wholesome consciousnesses (''kusala citta'').

Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 1320-1324}}
:Wholesome consciousness (''kusalacitta'') is consciousness accompanied by the wholesome roots—non-greed or generosity, non-hatred or loving-kindness, and non-delusion or wisdom. Such consciousness is mentally healthy, morally blameless, and productive of pleasant results.

The twenty-five beautiful mental factors (''sobhana cetasikas'') are:
* Nineteen universal beautiful mental factors (''sobhanasādhāraṇa''):
** ''[[Saddhā]]'' - faith
** ''[[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|Sati]]'' - mindfulness
** ''[[Hiri (Buddhism)|Hiri]]'' - shame at doing evil
** ''[[Ottappa]]'' - regard for consequence
** ''[[Alobha]]'' - lack of greed
** ''[[Adosa]]'' - lack of hatred
** ''[[Tatramajjhattatā]]'' - balance, neutrality of mind
** ''[[Passaddhi|Kāyapassaddhi]]''  - tranquility of mental body
** ''[[Passaddhi|Cittapassaddhi]]''  - tranquility of consciousness
** ''[[Lahutā|Kāyalahutā]]'' - lightness of mental body
** ''[[Lahutā|Cittalahutā]]'' - lightness of consciousness
** ''[[Mudutā|Kāyamudutā]]'' - malleability/softness of mental body
** ''[[Mudutā|Cittamudutā]]'' - malleability/softness of consciousness
** ''[[Kammaññatā|Kāyakammaññatā]]'' - wieldiness of mental body
** ''[[Kammaññatā|Cittakammaññatā]]'' - wieldiness of consciousness
** ''[[Pāguññatā|Kāyapāguññatā]]'' - proficiency of mental body
** ''[[Pāguññatā|Cittapāguññatā]]'' - proficiency of consciousness
** ''[[Ujukatā|Kāyujukatā]]'' - straightness/rectitude of mental body
** ''[[Ujukatā|Cittujukatā]]'' - straightness/rectitude of consciousness
* Three Abstinences (''virati''):
** ''[[Right speech|Sammāvācā]]'' - right speech
** ''[[Noble_Eightfold_Path#Right_action|Sammākammanta]]'' - right action
** ''[[Right livelihood|Sammā-ājīva]]'' - right livelihood
* Two Immeasurables (''appamañña''):
** ''[[Karuṇā]]'' - compassion
** ''[[Mudita]]'' - sympathetic joy
* One Faculty of wisdom (''paññindriya''):
** ''[[Paññā]]'' - wisdom

==Mahayana Abhidharma tradition==
Abhidharma studies in the Mahayana tradition are based on the Sanskrit Sarvāstivāda abhidharma system. Within this system, the [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] identifies fifty-one mental factors:

===Five universal mental factors ===
The five universal mental factors (''sarvatraga'') are:
# ''[[Sparśa]]'' - contact, contacting awareness, sense impression, touch
# ''[[Vedanā]]'' - feeling, sensation
# ''[[Saṃjñā]]'' - perception
# ''[[Cetanā]]'' - volition, intention
# ''[[Manasikara]]'' - attention

These five mental factors are referred to as ''universal'' or ''omnipresent'' because they operate in the wake of every mind situation. If any one of these factors is missing, then the experience of the object is incomplete. For example:
* If there is no ''sparśa'' (contact), then there would be no basis for perception.
* If there is no ''vedana'' (feeling, sensation), there is no relishing of the object.
* If there is no ''saṃjñā'' (perception), then the specific characteristic of the object is not perceived.
* If there is no ''cetanā'' (volition), then there is no movement towards and settling on the object.
* If there is no ''manasikara'' (attention), then there is not holding onto the object.&lt;ref&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Location 409-414.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Five object-determining mental factors ===
The five object-determining mental factors (''viṣayaniyata'') are:
# ''[[Chanda (Buddhism)|Chanda]]'' - desire (to act), intention, interest

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''mental model''' is an explanation of someone's [[thought]] process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person's intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences. Mental models can help shape [[behaviour]] and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal [[algorithm]]) and doing tasks.

A mental model is a kind of internal symbol or representation of external reality, hypothesized to play a major role in [[cognition]], [[reasoning]] and [[decision-making]]. [[Kenneth Craik]] suggested in 1943 that the mind constructs "small-scale models" of reality that it uses to anticipate events.

[[Jay Wright Forrester]] defined general mental models as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system (Forrester, 1971).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In psychology, the term ''mental models'' is sometimes used to refer to [[mental representation]]s or mental simulation generally. At other times it is used to refer to {{§l||Mental models and reasoning}} and to the mental model theory of reasoning developed by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]].

==History==
The term ''mental model'' is believed to have originated with [[Kenneth Craik]] in his 1943 book ''The Nature of Explanation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nersessian|first1=Nancy J.|authorlink=Nancy_J._Nersessian|title=In the Theoretician's Laboratory: Thought Experimenting as Mental Modeling|journal=PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association|date=1992|volume=1992|pages=291–301|url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/aimosaic/faculty/nersessian/papers/in-the-theoreticians-laboratory.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2014|quote=The contemporary notion that mental modelling plays a significant role in human reasoning was formulated, initially, by Kenneth Craik in 1943.|doi=10.1086/psaprocbienmeetp.1992.2.192843}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staggers|first1=Nancy|last2=Norcio|first2=A.F.|title=Mental models: concepts for human-computer interaction research|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|date=1993|volume=38|issue=4|pages=587–605|doi=10.1006/imms.1993.1028|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~norcio/papers/1993/Staggers-MM-IJMMS.pdf|quote=Although Johnson-Laird (1989) is generally credited with coining the term mental model, the history of the concept may be traced to Craik's (1943) work entitled ''The Nature of Explanation''.|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Georges-Henri Luquet|Georges-Henri Luquet]] in ''Le dessin enfantin'' (Children's drawings), published in 1927 by Alcan, Paris, argued that children construct internal models, a view that influenced, among others, child psychologist [[Jean Piaget]].

[[Philip Johnson-Laird]] published ''Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference and Consciousness'' in 1983. In the same year, [[Dedre Gentner]] and [[Albert Stevens]] edited a collection of chapters in a book also titled ''Mental Models''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lauradove.info/reports/mental%20models.htm "Mental models"], report at www.lauradove.info.&lt;/ref&gt; The first line of their book explains the idea further: "One function of this chapter is to belabor the obvious; people's views of the world, of themselves, of their own capabilities, and of the tasks that they are asked to perform, or topics they are asked to learn, depend heavily on the conceptualizations that they bring to the task." (see the book: ''[[Mental Models (Gentner-Stevens book)|Mental Models]]'').

Since then, there has been much discussion and use of the idea in [[human-computer interaction]] and [[usability]] by researchers including [[Donald Norman]] and Steve Krug (in his book ''[[Don't Make Me Think]]''). [[Walter Kintsch]] and [[Teun A. van Dijk]], using the term ''situation model'' (in their book ''Strategies of Discourse Comprehension'', 1983), showed the relevance of mental models for the production and comprehension of [[discourse]].

==Mental models and reasoning==&lt;!-- [[#Mental models and reasoning]] above links to this heading --&gt;
One view of human reasoning is that it depends on mental models. In this view, mental models can be constructed from perception, imagination, or the comprehension of discourse (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Such mental models are similar to architects' models or to physicists' diagrams in that their structure is analogous to the structure of the situation that they represent, unlike, say, the structure of logical forms used in formal rule theories of reasoning. In this respect, they are a little like pictures in the [[picture theory of language]] described by philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in 1922. [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] developed a theory of mental models which makes the assumption that reasoning depends, not on logical form, but on mental models (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991).

===Principles of mental models===
Mental models are based on a small set of fundamental assumptions ([[axiom]]s), which distinguish them from other proposed representations in the [[psychology of reasoning]] (Byrne and Johnson-Laird, 2009). Each mental model represents a possibility. A mental model represents one possibility, capturing what is common to all the different ways in which the possibility may occur (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 2002). Mental models are iconic, i.e., each part of a model corresponds to each part of what it represents (Johnson-Laird, 2006). Mental models are based on a principle of truth: they typically represent only those situations that are possible, and each model of a possibility represents only what is true in that possibility according to the proposition. However, mental models can represent what is false, temporarily assumed to be true, for example, in the case of [[counterfactual conditionals]] and [[counterfactual thinking]] (Byrne, 2005).

===Reasoning with mental models===
People infer that a conclusion is valid if it holds in all the possibilities. Procedures for reasoning with mental models rely on counter-examples to refute invalid inferences; they establish validity by ensuring that a conclusion holds over all the models of the premises. Reasoners focus on a subset of the possible models of multiple-model problems, often just a single model. The ease with which reasoners can make deductions is affected by many factors, including age and working memory (Barrouillet, et al., 2000). They reject a conclusion if they find a counterexample, i.e., a possibility in which the premises hold, but the conclusion does not (Schroyens, et al. 2003; Verschueren, et al., 2005).

===Criticisms===
Scientific debate continues about whether human reasoning is based on mental models, versus formal [[rules of inference]] (e.g., O'Brien, 2009), domain-specific rules of inference (e.g., Cheng &amp; Holyoak, 2008; Cosmides, 2005), or probabilities (e.g., Oaksford and Chater, 2007). Many empirical comparisons of the different theories have been carried out (e.g., Oberauer, 2006).

==Mental models of dynamics systems: mental models in system dynamics==

===Characteristics===
A mental model is generally:
* founded on unquantifiable, impugnable, obscure, or incomplete facts
* '''[[Cognitive flexibility|flexible]]''' – is considerably variable in positive as well as in negative sense
* an '''information filter''' – causes [[selective perception]], perception of only selected parts of [[information]]
* '''very limited''', compared with the complexities of the world, and even when a [[scientific modelling|scientific model]] is extensive and in accordance with a certain [[reality]] in the derivation of [[logical consequence]]s of it, it must take into account such restrictions as [[working memory]]; i.e., rules on the maximum number of elements that people are able to remember, [[gestaltism]]s or failure of the principles of [[logic]], etc.
* dependent on sources of information, which one can not find anywhere else, are available at any time and can be used.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://proverbs.cz/media/art/SM_ST.pdf |format=PDF |author=Šusta, Marek |title=Několik slov o systémové dynamice a systémovém myšlení |pages=3–9 |publisher=Proverbs, a.s. |language=Czech |accessdate= 2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mild2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mildeova, S., Vojtko V. |title=Systémová dynamika |year=2003 |isbn=80-245-0626-2 |publisher=Oeconomica |location=Prague |pages=19–24 |language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forste1997"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/jsterman/www/ford_sterman_elicit_1.pdf |format=PDF |author=Ford, David N., Sterman, John D. |title=Expert Knowledge Elicitation to Improve Mental and Formal Models |publisher=Cambridge, Massachusetts, US - Massachusetts Institute of Technology |pages=18–23 |accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental models are a fundamental way to understand organizational learning. Mental models, in popular science parlance, have been described as "deeply held images of thinking and acting".&lt;ref&gt;"Leading for a Change", Ralph Jacobson, 2000, Chapter 5, Page102&lt;/ref&gt; Mental models are so basic to understanding the world that people are hardly conscious of them.

===Expression of mental models of dynamic systems===
S.N. Groesser and M. Schaffernicht (2012) describe three basic methods which are typically used:
* [[Causal loop diagram]]s – displaying tendency and a direction of information connections and the resulting causality and feedback loops
* System structure diagrams – another way to express the structure of a qualitative dynamic system
* Stock and flow diagrams - a way to quantify the structure of a dynamic system
These methods allow showing a mental model of a dynamic system, as an explicit, written model about a certain system based on internal beliefs. Analyzing these graphical representations has been an increasing area of research across many social science fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Natalie A. |last2=Ross |first2=Helen |last3=Lynam |first3=Timothy |last4=Perez |first4=Pascal |last5=Leitch |first5=Anne |title=Mental Models:  An Interdisciplinary Synthesis of Theory and Methods |journal=Ecology and Society |date=2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |doi=10.5751/ES-03802-160146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally software tools that attempt to capture and analyze the structural and functional properties of individual mental models such as Mental Modeler, "a participatory modeling tool based in fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalmodeler.org/resources/Gray%20et%20al%20Mental%20Modeler%202013.pdf|title=Mental Modeler: A Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Mapping Modeling Tool for Adaptive Environmental Management|author=|date=|website=mentalmodeler.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have recently been developed and used to collect/compare/combine mental model representations collected from individuals for use in social science research, collaborative decision-making, and natural resource planning.

===Mental model in relation to system dynamics and systemic thinking===
In the simplification of reality, creating a model can find a sense of reality, seeking to overcome [[systemic thinking]] and [[system dynamics]].

These two disciplines can help to construct a better coordination with the reality of mental models and simulate it accurately. They increase the probability that the consequences of how to decide and act in accordance with how to plan.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"/&gt;

* '''[[System dynamics]]''' – extending mental models through the creation of explicit models, which are clear, easily communicated and can be compared with each other.
* '''[[Systemic thinking]]''' – seeking the means to improve the mental models and thereby improve the quality of dynamic decisions that are based on mental models.

===Single and double-loop learning===
After analyzing the basic characteristics, it is necessary to bring the process of changing the mental models, or the process of learning. [[Learning]] is a back-loop [[wikt:process|process]], and [[feedback]] loops can be illustrated as: single-loop learning or double-loop learning.

====Single-loop learning====
Mental models affect the way that people work with information, and also how they determine the final decision. The decision itself changes, but the mental models remain the same. It is the predominant method of learning, because it is very convenient.

====Double-loop learning====
{{Main|Double-loop learning}}
Double-loop learning (''see diagram below'') is used when it is necessary to change the mental model on which a decision depends. Unlike single loops, this model includes a shift in understanding, from simple and static to broader and more dynamic, such as taking into account the changes in the surroundings and the need for expression changes in mental models.&lt;ref name="mild2003"/&gt;

'''Anne (Nancy) Flanagan''' (born 1929) is a local community worker and rights activist, living in the [[Vauxhall, Liverpool|Vauxhall area of Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottiepress.org/projects/achieve.htm |title=Achievements |website=Scottiepress.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Flanagan worked  to improve the health, social and living conditions within the Vauxhall area for over 40 years, starting when she became chairperson of the Vauxhall Project in 1969. Flanagan held the position for three years. In 1984 she became chairperson of the Vauxhall Neighbourhood Council and as of 2015 was still active, as well as being chairperson of the Heriot Street Residents Association.  Throughout her 50 years of public service, Flanagan did not take a salary and contributed her time voluntarily.

Flanagan was involved in the campaign to build the Vauxhall Health Centre in Limekiln Lane and other projects, like the Vauxhall Health Forum. As well as these causes, Flanagan was involved with the establishing of the Vauxhall Neighbourhood Council's day nursery, the Merseyside Accredited Childcare Training and Assessment Centre (MACTAC), VNC Lifeline and Vauxhall [[Sure Start]]. Her work was recognised in 2004, when Flanagan was awarded the [[MBE]] for her endeavours within her local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmonuments.co.uk/inaugural.htm |title=Inaugural Meeting of The Friends of Liverpool Monuments |website=Liverpoolmonuments.co.uk |date=2005-01-18 |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flanagan lives alone in the home she shared with her late husband Joe Flanagan and their five children and as of 2015 is still active in local initiatives.

(p. 126)|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''obscurantism'' derives from the title of the 16th-century satire ''[[Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum]]'' (1515–19, ''Letters of Obscure Men''), that was based upon the [[intellectualism|intellectual]] dispute between the German humanist [[Johann Reuchlin]] and the monk [[Johannes Pfefferkorn]] of the [[Dominican Order]], about whether or not all [[Judaism|Jewish]] books should be [[Book burning|burned]] as un-Christian heresy. Earlier, in 1509, the monk Pfefferkorn had obtained permission from [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1486–1519), to burn all copies of the [[Talmud]] ([[Jewish law]] and [[Jewish ethics]]) known to be in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (AD 926–1806); the ''Letters of Obscure Men'' satirized the Dominican arguments for burning "un-Christian" works.

In the 18th century, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers applied the term ''obscurantist'' to any enemy of intellectual enlightenment and the liberal diffusion of knowledge. In the 19th century, in distinguishing the varieties of obscurantism found in [[metaphysics]] and [[theology]] from the "more subtle" obscurantism of the [[critical philosophy]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], and of modern [[philosophical skepticism]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] said: "The essential element in the black art of obscurantism is not that it wants to darken individual understanding, but that it wants to blacken our picture of the world, and darken our idea of existence."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, F. (1878) ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' Vol. II, Part 1, 27. Cambridge University Press; 2 edition (November 13, 1996). {{ISBN|978-0-521-56704-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In restricting knowledge to an [[Elite|élite]] ruling class of "the few", obscurantism is fundamentally [[anti-democratic]], because its component [[anti-intellectualism]] and [[elitism]] exclude the people as [[intellect]]ually unworthy of knowing the facts and truth about the [[government]] of their [[City-State]].&lt;ref name=Hersh&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Seymour M. Hersh]], [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/05/12/selective-intelligence "Selective Intelligence"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 12 May 2003, accessed April 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;Brian Doherty, [http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml "Origin of the Specious: Why Do Neoconservatives Doubt Darwin?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725170209/http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml |date=2008-07-25 }}, ''[[Reason Online]]'' July 1997, accessed 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 18th century monarchic France, the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], as a [[political science|political scientist]], documented the [[aristocracy]]'s obscurantism about the social problems that provoked the [[French Revolution]] (1789–99) that deposed them and their [[List of French monarchs|King]], [[Louis XVI of France]].

In 18th century monarchic France, the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], as a [[political science|political scientist]], documented the [[aristocracy]]'s obscurantism about the social problems that provoked the [[French Revolution]] (1789–99) that deposed them and their [[List of French monarchs|King]], [[Louis XVI of France]].

In the 19th century, the [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[William Kingdon Clifford]], an early proponent of [[Darwinism]], devoted some writings to uprooting obscurantism in England, after hearing clerics—who privately agreed with him about evolution—publicly denounce [[evolution]] as un-[[Christianity|Christian]]. Moreover, in the realm of organized religion, obscurantism is a distinct strain of thought independent of theologic allegiance. The distinction is that fundamentalism presupposes sincere religious belief, whereas obscurantism is based upon minority manipulation of the popular faith as political praxis; cf. [[Censorship]].&lt;ref name = Obs&gt;Syed, I. (2002) [http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_51_100/obscurantism.htm "Obscurantism"]. From: ''Intellectual Achievements of Muslims''.

=== Leo Strauss ===

==== Political philosophy ====
In the 20th century, the American conservative [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] [[Leo Strauss]], for whom philosophy and politics intertwined, and his [[Neoconservatism|Neo-conservative]] adherents adopted the notion of government by the enlightened few as political strategy. He noted that [[intellectuals]], dating from [[Plato]], confronted the dilemma of either an informed populace "interfering" with government, or if it were possible for [[Value (ethics)|good]] politicians to be truthful and still govern to maintain a stable society—hence the [[Noble Lie]] necessary in securing public acquiescence. In ''The City and Man'' (1964), he discusses the myths in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' that Plato proposes effective governing requires, among them, the belief that the country (land) ruled by the State belongs to it (despite some having been conquered from others), and that citizenship derives from more than the [[accident of birth]] in the City-State. Thus, in the ''New Yorker'' magazine article ''Selective Intelligence'', [[Seymour Hersh]] observes that Strauss endorsed the "[[Noble Lie]]" concept: the myths politicians use in maintaining a cohesive society.&lt;ref name="Hersh"&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Seymour M. Hersh]], [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/05/12/selective-intelligence "Selective Intelligence"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 12 May 2003, accessed April 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;Brian Doherty, [http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml "Origin of the Specious: Why Do Neoconservatives Doubt Darwin?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725170209/http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml|date=2008-07-25}}, ''[[Reason Online]]'' July 1997, accessed 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shadia Drury]] criticized Strauss's acceptance of dissembling and deception of the populace as "the peculiar justice of the wise", whereas Plato proposed the Noble Lie as based upon [[Morality|moral]] good. In criticizing ''Natural Right and History'' (1953), she said that "Strauss thinks that the superiority of the ruling philosophers is an intellectual superiority and not a moral one ... [he] is the only interpreter who gives a sinister reading to Plato, and then celebrates him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/faith-iraqwarphiloshophy/article_1542.jsp|title=Noble lies and perpetual war: Leo Strauss, the neocons, and Iraq|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Esoteric texts ====
Leo Strauss also was criticized for proposing the notion of "esoteric" meanings to ancient texts, obscure knowledge inaccessible to the "ordinary" intellect. In ''Persecution and the Art of Writing'' (1952), he proposes that some philosophers write esoterically to avert persecution by the political or religious authorities, and, per his knowledge of [[Maimonides]], [[Al Farabi]], and [[Plato]], proposed that an esoteric writing style is proper for the philosophic text. Rather than explicitly presenting his thoughts, the philosopher's esoteric writing compels the reader to think independently of the text, and so learn. In the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phædrus]]'', Socrates notes that writing does not reply to questions, but invites dialogue with the reader, thereby minimizing the problems of grasping the written word. Strauss noted that one of writing's political dangers is students' too-readily accepting dangerous ideas—as in the trial of [[Socrates]], wherein the relationship with [[Alcibiades]] was used to prosecute him.

For Leo Strauss, philosophers' texts offered the reader lucid "exoteric" (salutary) and obscure "esoteric" (true) teachings, which are concealed to the reader of ordinary intellect; emphasizing that writers often left contradictions and other errors to encourage the reader's more scrupulous (re-)reading of the text. In observing and maintaining the "[[exoteric]]&amp;nbsp;– [[esoteric]]" dichotomy, Strauss was accused of obscurantism, and for writing esoterically. 

=== Bill Joy ===
[[File:Bill joy.jpg|thumb|right|125px|[[Bill Joy]]]]
In the ''Wired'' magazine article, "[[Why the Future Doesn't Need Us]]" (April 2000), the computer scientist [[Bill Joy]], then a [[Sun Microsystems]] chief scientist, in the sub-title proposed that: "Our most powerful twenty-first-century technologies—robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotech[nology]—are threatening to make humans an endangered species"; in the body, he posits that:

:"The experiences of the atomic scientists clearly show the need to take personal responsibility, the danger that things will move too fast, and the way in which a process can take on a life of its own. We can, as they did, create insurmountable problems in almost no time flat. We must do more thinking up front if we are not to be similarly surprised and shocked by the consequences of our inventions."&lt;ref&gt;Khushf, George (2004). "The Ethics of Nanotechnology: Vision and Values for a New Generation of Science and Engineering", ''Emerging Technologies and Ethical Issues in Engineering'', National Academy of Engineering, pp. 31–32. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. {{ISBN|0-309-09271-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joy's proposal for limiting the dissemination of "certain" knowledge, in behalf of preserving society, was quickly likened to obscurantism. A year later, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], in the ''Science and Technology Policy Yearbook 2001'', published the article "A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists", wherein the computer scientists [[John Seely Brown]] and Paul Duguid countered his proposal as technological tunnel vision, and the predicted technologically derived problems as infeasible, for disregarding the influence of non-scientists upon such societal problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031231160458/http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-12-31 |title=A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and- Gloom Technofuturists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appeal to emotion ==
[[File:Friedrich Hayek portrait.jpg|thumb|right|175px|&lt;center&gt;The economist [[Friedrich August von Hayek]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the essay "Why I Am Not a Conservative" (1960), the economist [[Friedrich von Hayek]] said that political [[conservatism]] is ideologically unrealistic, because of the conservative person’s inability to adapt to changing human realities and refusal to offer a positive political program that benefits everyone in a society. In that context, Hayek used the term ''obscurantism'' differently, to denote and describe the [[denial]] of the empirical truth of scientific theory, because of the disagreeable [[Morality|moral]] consequences that might arise from acceptance of fact.

== Deliberate obscurity ==
The second sense of ''obscurantism'' denotes making knowledge abstruse, that is, difficult to grasp. In the 19th and 20th centuries obscurantism became a [[polemics|polemical]] term for accusing an author of deliberately writing obscurely, in order to hide his or her [[intellectualism|intellectual]] vacuousness. Philosophers who are neither [[empiricism|empiricists]] nor [[positivism|positivists]] often are considered obscurantists when describing the abstract concepts of their disciplines. For philosophic reasons, such authors might modify or reject verifiability, falsifiability, and logical non-contradiction. From that perspective, obscure (clouded, vague, abstruse) writing does not necessarily indicate that the writer has a poor grasp of the subject, because unintelligible writing sometimes is purposeful and philosophically considered.&lt;ref name=Rorty&gt;Rorty, Richard (1989) ''Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Ch. 6: "From Ironist Theory to Private Allusions: Derrida". {{ISBN|0-521-36781-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|120px|&lt;center&gt;[[Aristotle]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Aristotle ===
In contemporary discussions of [[virtue ethics]], [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (''The Ethics'') stands accused of ethical obscurantism, because of the technical, philosophic language and writing style, and their purpose being the [[education]] of a cultured governing [[elite]].&lt;ref name=b&gt;Lisa van Alstyne, "Aristotle's Alleged Ethical Obscurantism." ''Philosophy,'' Vol. 73, No. 285 (July, 1998), pp. 429–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kant ===
[[Immanuel Kant]] employed technical terms that were not commonly understood by the layman. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] contended that post-Kantian philosophers such as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] deliberately imitated the abstruse style of writing practiced by Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, ''Manuscript Remains'', Vol. 4, "Cogitata I," §&amp;nbsp;107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hegel ===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|120px|&lt;center&gt;[[G. W. F. Hegel]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]'s philosophy, and the philosophies of those he influenced, especially [[Karl Marx]], have been accused of obscurantism. [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic]] and [[Logical positivism|positivistic]] philosophers, such as [[A. J. Ayer]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and the [[Critical Rationalism|critical-rationalist]] [[Karl Popper]], accused Hegel and [[Hegelianism]] of being obscure. About Hegel's philosophy, Schopenhauer wrote that it is: "...&amp;nbsp;a colossal piece of mystification, which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage.&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur (1965). ''On the Basis of Morality'', trans. E.F.J. Payne. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, pp.15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, biographer Terry Pinkard notes "Hegel has refused to go away, even in analytic philosophy, itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Hegel: A Biography'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000, xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel was aware of his obscurantism, and perceived it as part of philosophical thinking: to accept and transcend the limitations of quotidian (everyday) thought and its concepts. In the essay "Who Thinks Abstractly?", he said that it is not the philosopher who thinks abstractly, but the layman, who uses concepts as [[:wikt:given|givens]] that are immutable, without context. It is the philosopher who thinks concretely, because he transcends the limits of quotidian [[concept]]s, in order to understand their broader context. This makes philosophical thought and language appear obscure, esoteric, and mysterious to the layman.

=== Marx ===
[[File:Marx4.jpg|thumb|120px|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Karl Marx]] in 1861&lt;/center&gt;]]

In his early works,&lt;ref&gt;See his ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1844), ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1845), and ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' (1847).&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Marx criticized German and French philosophy, especially [[German Idealism]], for its traditions of German irrationalism and ideologically motivated obscurantism.&lt;ref&gt;See, Dallmayr, Fred R., "The Discourse of Modernity: Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger (and Habermas)", ''PRAXIS International'' (4/1988), pp. 377–404.&lt;/ref&gt; Later thinkers whom he influenced, such as the philosopher [[György Lukács]] and social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]], followed with similar arguments of their own.&lt;ref&gt;[[György Lukács]]'s ''The Destruction of Reason''; [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity''&lt;/ref&gt; However, philosophers such as Karl Popper and Friedrich Hayek in turn criticized Marx and [[Marxism|Marxist]] philosophy as obscurantist (however, see [[#Appeal to emotion|above]] for Hayek's particular interpretation of the term).&lt;ref&gt;Wright, E. O., Levine, A., &amp; Sober, E. (1992). ''Reconstructing Marxism: essays on explanation and the theory of history''. London: Verso, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heidegger ===
[[Martin Heidegger]], and those influenced by him, such as [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]], have been labeled obscurantists by critics from analytic philosophy and the [[Critical theory (Frankfurt School)|Frankfurt School of critical theory]]. Of Heidegger, [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote, "his philosophy is extremely obscure. One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot. An interesting point in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive. As with much else in Existentialism, this is a psychological observation made to pass for logic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Russell|first = Bertrand|authorlink = Bertrand Russell|title = Wisdom of the West|publisher = Crescent Books|year = 1989|pages = 303|isbn = 978-0-517-69041-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is Russell's complete entry on Heidegger, and it expresses the sentiments of many 20th-century analytic philosophers concerning Heidegger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0801485649|title=Heidegger: An Introduction|first=Richard|last=Polt|date=7 January 1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|accessdate=11 February 2017|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Derrida ===
In their obituaries, "Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies at 74" (10 October 2004) and "Obituary of Jacques Derrida, French intellectual" (21 October 2004), ''[[The New York Times]]'' newspaper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/obituaries/10derrida.html|title=Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies in Paris at 74|date=10 October 2004|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3308320|title=Jacques Derrida|date=21 October 2004|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2017|via=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; described Derrida as a deliberately obscure philosopher.

In ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'' (1989), [[Richard Rorty]] proposed that in ''The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond'' (1978), Jacques Derrida purposefully used undefinable words (e.g. [[Différance]]), and used defined words in contexts so diverse that they render the words unintelligible, hence, the reader is unable to establish a context for his literary self. In that way, the philosopher Derrida escapes metaphysical accounts of his work. Since the work ostensibly contains no metaphysics, Derrida has, consequently, escaped metaphysics.&lt;ref name=Rorty /&gt;

Derrida's philosophic work is especially controversial among American and British academics, as when the [[University of Cambridge]] awarded him an honorary doctorate, despite opposition from among the Cambridge philosophy faculty and analytical philosophers worldwide. In opposing the decision, philosophers including [[Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|Barry Smith]], [[W. V. O. Quine]], [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]], [[René Thom]], and twelve others, published a letter of protestation in ''[[The Times]]'' of London, arguing that "his works employ a written style that defies comprehension ... [thus] Academic status based on what seems to us to be little more than semi-intelligible attacks upon the values of reason, truth, and scholarship is not, we submit, sufficient grounds for the awarding of an honorary degree in a distinguished university."&lt;ref&gt;Barry Smith et al., "Open letter against Derrida receiving an honorary doctorate from Cambridge University," ''The Times'' [London], 9 May 1992. [http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/varia/Derrida_Letter.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''New York Review of Books'' article "An Exchange on Deconstruction" (February 1984), [[John Searle]] comments on [[Deconstruction]]: "... anyone who reads deconstructive texts with an open mind is likely to be struck by the same phenomena that initially surprised me: the low level of philosophical argumentation, the deliberate obscurantism of the prose, the wildly exaggerated claims, and the constant striving to give the appearance of profundity, by making claims that seem paradoxical, but under analysis often turn out to be silly or trivial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mackey| first = Louis H.| title = An Exchange on Deconstruction (Reply by John R. Searle)| journal = New York Review of Books| volume = 31| issue = 1| date = February 2, 1984| url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5964| accessdate = 2007-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lacan ===
[[Jacques Lacan]] was an [[intellectual]] who defended obscurantism to a degree. To his students' complaint about the deliberate obscurity of his lectures, he replied: "The less you understand, the better you listen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7Xw4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=%22The+less+you+understand,+the+better+you+listen%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20less%20you%20understand%2C%20the%20better%20you%20listen%22&amp;f=false | title = The ego in Freud's theory and in the technique of psychoanalysis, 1954–1955 | isbn = 978-0-521-31801-3 | author1 = Lacan | first1 = Jacques | year = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1973 seminar ''Encore'', he said that his ''Écrits'' (''Writings'') were not to be understood, but would effect a meaning in the reader, like that induced by mystical texts. The obscurity is not in his writing style, but in the repeated allusions to Hegel, derived from [[Alexandre Kojève]]'s lectures on Hegel, and similar theoretic divergences.

=== Sokal Affair ===

The [[Sokal Affair]] (1996) was a publishing [[hoax]] that the professor of physics [[Alan Sokal]] perpetrated on the editors and readers of ''[[Social Text]]'', an [[academic journal]] of [[postmodernism|post-modern]] [[cultural studies]] that was not then a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] publication. In 1996, as an experiment testing [[publishing|editorial]] integrity (fact-checking, verification, peer review, etc.), Sokal submitted "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity", a [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] article proposing that physical reality is a social construct, in order to learn if ''Social Text'' would "publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if: (a) it sounded good, and, (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions".&lt;ref name = Physicist&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html| title = A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies| accessdate= April 3, 2007| last = Sokal| first = Alan D.| authorlink = Alan Sokal| work = [[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]| date =May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sokal's fake article was published in the Spring/Summer 1996 issue of ''Social Text'', which was dedicated to the [[Science Wars]] about the conceptual validity of [[scientific objectivity]] and the nature of scientific theory, among [[Scientific realism|scientific realists]] and postmodern critics in American universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.physics.nyu.edu/~as2/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html| title = Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity| accessdate= 3 April 2007| last = Sokal| first = Alan D.| authorlink = Alan Sokal| date = Spring–Summer 1996 |origyear=1994 (original version published 1994-11-28, revised 1995-05-13)| work = [[Social Text]]|issue= 46/47| publisher = [[Duke University]] Press| pages = 217–252|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070326153354/http://www.physics.nyu.edu/~as2/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate = 26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sokal's ''raison de guerre'' ("war reason") for publication of a false article was that postmodernist critics questioned the objectivity of science, by criticising the [[scientific method]] and the nature of knowledge, usually in the disciplines of cultural studies, [[cultural anthropology]], [[feminist studies]], [[comparative literature]], [[media studies]], and [[science and technology studies]]. Whereas the scientific realists countered that objective scientific knowledge exists, riposting that postmodernist critics almost knew nothing of the science they criticized. In the event, editorial deference to "[[Appeal to Authority|Academic Authority]]" (the Author-Professor) prompted the editors of ''Social Text'' not to fact-check Sokal's manuscript by submitting it to peer review by a scientist.

Later, concerning the lack of editorial integrity shown by the publication of his fake article in ''Social Text'' magazine, Sokal addressed the matter in the May 1996 edition of the ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' journal, in the article "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies", in which he (Sokal) announced that his transformative hermeneutics article was a [[parody]], submitted "to test the prevailing intellectual standards", and concluded that, as an academic publication, ''Social Text'' ignored the requisite [[intellectual rigor]] of verification and "felt comfortable publishing an article on [[quantum physics]] without bothering to consult anyone knowledgeable in the subject".&lt;ref name = Physicist /&gt;&lt;ref name="LinguaFranca"&gt;{{cite news | last = Sokal| first = Alan | title = A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies | pages = 2| newspaper = Lingua Franca| date = May–June 1996| url = http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~censor/katz-directory/01-07-17sokal-lingua-franca-experiment.pdf| accessdate =27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, as a [[Intellectual|public intellectual]], Sokal said his hoax was an action protesting against the contemporary tendency towards obscurantism—abstruse, esoteric, and vague writing in the [[social sciences]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In short, my concern over the spread of [[subjectivism|subjectivist]] thinking is both intellectual and political. Intellectually, the problem with such doctrines is that they are false (when not simply meaningless). There is a real world; its properties are not merely social constructions; facts and evidence do matter. What sane person would contend otherwise? And yet, much contemporary academic theorizing consists precisely of attempts to blur these obvious truths—the utter absurdity of it all being concealed through obscure and pretentious language.&lt;ref name = Physicist /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, independent of the hoax, as a pseudoscientific [[Masterpiece|opus]], the article "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity" is described as an exemplar "[[pastiche]] of [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Cant (language)|cant]], fawning references, grandiose quotations, and outright nonsense, centered on the claim that physical reality is merely a social construct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Harrell| first = Evans| title = A Report from the Front of the "Science Wars": The controversy over the book ''Higher Superstition,'' by Gross and Levitt and the recent articles by Sokal| journal = Notices of the American Mathematical Society| volume = 43| issue = 10| pages = 1132–1136| date =October 1996| url = http://www.ams.org/notices/199610/comm-harrell.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28072">'''Panopticism''' is a [[social theory]] named after the [[Panopticon]], originally developed by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] in his book ''[[Discipline and Punish]].'' The "panopticon" refers to an experimental laboratory of power in which behaviour could be modified, and Foucault viewed the panopticon as a symbol of the disciplinary society of surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foucault|first1=Michel|title=Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison|date=1985|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

[[Jeremy Bentham]] proposed the [[panopticon]] as a circular building with an observation tower in the centre of an open space surrounded by an outer wall.  This wall would contain cells for occupants.  This design would increase security by facilitating more effective [[surveillance]].  Residing within cells flooded with light, occupants would be readily distinguishable and visible to an official invisibly positioned in the central tower.  Conversely, occupants would be invisible to each other, with concrete walls dividing their cells. Due to the bright lighting emitted from the watch tower, occupants would not be able to tell if and when they are being watched, making discipline a passive rather than an active action. Strangely, the cell-mates act in matters as if they are being watched, though they cannot be certain eyes are actually on them. There is a type of invisible discipline that reigns through the prison, for each prisoner self-regulates, in fear that someone is watching their every move. Although usually associated with [[prison]]s, the panoptic style of architecture might be used in other institutions with surveillance needs, such as schools, factories, or hospitals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Foucault's ''Discipline and Punish'' ==

In ''Discipline and Punish'', Michel Foucault builds on Bentham's conceptualization of the panopticon as he elaborates upon the function of disciplinary mechanisms in such a prison and illustrates the function of discipline as an apparatus of power.  The ever-visible inmate, Foucault suggests, is always "the object of information, never a subject in communication".&lt;ref name = cartome&gt;{{cite web |title = Part Three: Discipline 3. Panopticism |publisher= Cartome |url= http://www.cartome.org/foucault.htm |accessdate= 2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He adds that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"He who is subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsibility for the constraints of power; he makes them play spontaneously upon himself; he inscribes in himself the power relation in which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection" (202-203).&lt;ref name="Foucault, Michel 1995"&gt;Foucault, Michel. Discipline and Punishment. Vintage Books, New York: 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Foucault offers still another explanation for the type of "anonymous power" held by the operator of the central tower, suggesting that, "We have seen that anyone may come and exercise in the central tower the functions of surveillance, and that this being the case, he can gain a clear idea of the way the surveillance is practiced".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. Discipline and Punishment. Vintage Books, New York: 1995., p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;  By including the anonymous "public servant," as part of the built-in "architecture" of surveillance, the disciplinary mechanism of observation is decentered and its efficacy improved.

As hinted at by the architecture, this panoptic design can be used for any "population" that needs to be kept under observation or control, such as: prisoners, schoolchildren, medical patients, or workers: &lt;blockquote&gt;"If the inmates are convicts, there is no danger of a plot, an attempt at collective escape, the planning of new crimes for the future, bad reciprocal influences; if they are patients, there is no danger of contagion; if they are madmen there is no risk of their committing violence upon one another; if they are schoolchildren, there is no copying, no noise, no chatter, no waste of time; if they are workers, there are no disorders, no theft, no coalitions, none of those distractions that slow down the rate of work, make it less perfect or cause accidents".&lt;ref name = cartome/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; By individualizing the subjects and placing them in a state of constant visibility, the efficiency of the institution is maximized. Furthermore, it guarantees the function of power, even when there is no one actually asserting it. It is in this respect that the Panopticon functions automatically. Foucault goes on to explain that this design is also applicable for a laboratory. Its mechanisms of individualization and observation give it the capacity to run many experiments simultaneously. These qualities also give an authoritative figure the "ability to penetrate men’s behavior" without difficulty.&lt;ref name = cartome/&gt; This is all made possible through the ingenuity of the geometric architecture.  In light of this fact Foucault compares jails, schools, and factories in their structural similarities.

== Examples in the late 20th and early 21st centuries ==

A central idea of Foucault’s panopticism concerns the systematic ordering and controlling of human populations through subtle and often unseen forces.  Such ordering is apparent in many parts of the modernized and now, increasingly digitalized, world of information.  Contemporary advancements in technology and surveillance techniques have perhaps made Foucault’s theories more pertinent to any scrutiny of the relationship between the state and its population.

However, while on one hand, new technologies, such as CCTV or other surveillance cameras, have shown the continued utility of panoptic mechanisms in liberal democracies, it could also be argued that electronic surveillance technologies are unnecessary in the original "organic" or "geometric" disciplinary mechanisms as illustrated by Foucault.  Foucault argues, for instance, that [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s Panopticon provides us with a model in which a self-disciplined society has been able to develop. These apparatuses of behavior control are essential if we are to govern ourselves, without the constant surveillance and intervention by an "agency" in every aspect of our lives. The Canadian historian [[Robert Gellately]] has observed, for instance, that because of the widespread willingness of Germans to inform on each other to the [[Gestapo]] that Germany between 1933-45 was a prime example of Panopticism.&lt;ref&gt;Gellately, Robert ''The Gestapo and German Society'', Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1990 pages 11-12 &amp; 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Panoptic theory has other wide-ranging impacts for surveillance in the digital era as well.  Kevin Haggerty and Richard Ericson, for instance, have hinted that technological surveillance "solutions" have a particularly "strong cultural allure" in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Richard V. Ericson and Kevin D. Haggerty, "The new politics of surveillance and visibility," University of Toronto Press, 2006., p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly visible data, made accessible to organizations and individuals from new [[Data mining|data-mining]] technologies, has led to the proliferation of “[[dataveillance]],” which may be described as a mode of surveillance that aims to single out particular transactions through routine [[algorithm]]ic production.  In some cases, however, particularly in the case of mined credit card information, dataveillance has been documented to have led to a greater incidence of errors than past surveillance techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Richard V. Ericson and Kevin D. Haggerty, "The new politics of surveillance and visibility," University of Toronto Press, 2006., p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the tenets of Foucault's panopticism, if discursive mechanisms can be effectively employed to control and/or modify the body of discussion within a particular space (usually to the benefit of a particular governing class or organization), then there is no longer any need for an "active agent" to display a more overtly coercive power (i.e., the threat of violence).  Since the beginning of the [[Information Age]], there exists a debate over whether these mechanisms are being refined or accelerated, or on the other hand, becoming increasingly redundant, due to new and rapid technological advancements.

== Panopticism and capitalism ==

Foucault also relates panopticism to capitalism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[The] peculiarity of the disciplines [elements of Panopticism] is that they try to define in relation to the multiplicities a tactics of power that fulfils three criteria: firstly, to obtain the exercise of power at the lowest possible cost (economically, by the low expenditure it involves; politically, by its discretion, its low exteriorization, its relative invisibility, the little resistance it arouses); secondly, to bring the effects of this social power to their maximum intensity and to extend them as far as possible, without either failure or interval; thirdly, to link this 'economic' growth of power with the output of the apparatuses (educational, military, industrial or medical) within which it is exercised; in short, to increase both the docility and the utility of all elements of the system" (218).&lt;ref name="Foucault, Michel 1995"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If the economic take-off of the West began with the techniques that made possible the accumulation of capital, it might perhaps be said that the methods for administering the accumulation of men made possible a political take-off in relation to the traditional, ritual, costly, violent forms of power [i.e. torture, public executions, corporal punishment, etc. of the middle ages], which soon fell into disuse and were superseded by a subtle, calculated technology of subjection. In fact, the two processes - the accumulation of men and the accumulation of capital - cannot be separated; it would not be possible to solve the problem of the accumulation of men without the growth of an apparatus of production capable of both sustaining them and using them; conversely, the techniques that made the cumulative multiplicity of men useful accelerated the accumulation of capital ... The growth of the capitalist economy gave rise to the specific modality of disciplinary power, whose general formulas, techniques of submitting forces and bodies, in short, 'political anatomy', could be operated in the most diverse political régimes, apparatuses or institutions" (220-221).&lt;ref name="Foucault, Michel 1995"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Panopticism and information technology ==

Building onto Foucault's Panopticism and Bentham's original Panopticon, [[Shoshana Zuboff]] applies the Panoptical theory in a technological context in her book, "In the Age of the Smart Machine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|pages=315–361|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter nine, Zuboff provides a very vivid portrayal of the Information Panopticon as a means of surveillance, discipline and, in some cases, punishment in a work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=326|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Information Panopticon embodies Bentham's idea in a very different way. Information Panopticons do not rely on physical arrangements, such as building structures and direct human supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=322|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, a computer keeps track of a worker’s every move by assigning him or her specific tasks to perform during their shift. Everything, from the time a task is started to the time it is completed, is recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=331|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers are given a certain amount of time to complete the task based on its complexity. All this is monitored by supervision from a computer. Based on the data, the supervisor can monitor a worker’s performance and take any necessary action when needed.

The Information Panopticon can be defined as a form of centralized power that uses information and communication technology as observational tools and control mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolar|first=Jeff|title=Business as Usual: The Information Panopticon and the Workplace|url=http://www.hastac.org/blogs/jeffkolar/business-usual-information-panopticon-and-workplace|work=Humanities, Arts, Science and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Panopticon envisioned by Bentham and Foucault, in which those under surveillance were unwilling subjects, Zuboff’s work suggests that the Information Panopticon is facilitated by the benefits it offers to willing participants.

In chapter ten of “In the Age of the Smart Machine,” Zuboff provides the example of DIALOG, a computer conferencing system used at a pharmaceutical corporation in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Zuboff 1988 364"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=364|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conferencing system, originally intended to facilitate communication among the corporation’s many branches, quickly became popular with employees. Users of DIALOG found that the system facilitated not only innovation and collaboration, but also relaxation, as many employees began to use the system to joke with one another and discuss non-work related topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=377|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employees widely reported that using the system was a positive experience because it created a culture of shared information and discussion, which transcended the corporation’s norms of formality and hierarchy that limited the spread of information between divisions and employees of different ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=368|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This positive culture was enabled by the privacy seemingly offered by the conferencing system, as discussion boards could be made to allow access only to those who were invited to participate.&lt;ref name="Zuboff 1988 364"/&gt; The Panoptic function of the conferencing system was revealed, however, when managers were able to gain access to the informal discussion boards where employees posted off-color jokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=378|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messages from the discussion were posted around the office to shame contributors, and many of DIALOG’s users, now knowing there was a possibility that their contributions could be read by managers and fearing they would face disciplinary action, stopped using the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=380|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users, however, kept using the system, raising the question of whether remaining users modified their behavior under the threat of surveillance, as prisoners in Bentham’s Panopticon would, or whether they believed that the benefits offered by the system outweighed the possibility of punishment.

Zuboff’s work shows the dual nature of the Information Panopticon – participants may be under surveillance, but they may also use the system to conduct surveillance of others by monitoring or reporting other users’ contributions. This is true of many other information and communication technologies with Panoptic functions – cellphone owners may be tracked without their knowledge through the phones’ GPS capabilities, but they may also use the device to conduct surveillance of others. Thus, compared to Bentham’s Panopticon, the Information Panopticon is one in which everyone has the potential to be both a prisoner and a guard.

It is argued by Foucault that [[industrial management]] has paved the way for a very disciplinary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=319|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A society that values objectivity over everything else. The point of this is to get as much productivity from the workers as possible. Contrasting with Bentham's model prison, workers within the Information Panopticon know they are being monitored at all times. Even if a supervisor is not physically there, the computer records their every move and all this data is at the supervisor's finger tips at all times. The system's objectivity can have a psychological impact on the workers. Workers feel the need to conform and satisfy the system rather than doing their best work or expressing concerns they might have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=342|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Information Panopticon diverts from [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s model prison by adding more levels of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|pages=337–341|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Bentham's model prison system is made up of inmates at the lowest level monitored by a guard, the Information Panopticon can have various levels. A company or firm can have various satellite locations, each monitored by a supervisor, and then a regional supervisor monitoring the supervisors below him or her. Depending on the structure and size of a firm, information Panopticons can have several levels, each monitoring all the levels beneath it.

Now, the efficiency of the Information Panopticon is in question. Does it really lead to a better work place and higher productivity, or does it simply put unnecessary stress on the people being monitored? A major criticism of the system is its objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=360|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is solely based on numbers, therefore not allowing for human error. According to Zuboff, some people find the system to be highly advantageous, while others think it is very flawed because it does not account for the effort a worker puts into a task or things outside of a worker's control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|pages=351–353|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the lack of direct supervision only adds to a potentially precarious situation.

== Post-panopticism ==

Theoretical arguments in favor of rejecting the Foucauldian model of Panopticism may be considered under five general headings:&lt;ref name=Boyne&gt;Boyne, Roy (2000). Post-Panopticism, Economy and Society, 29:2, 285-307.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Displacement of the Panoptical ideal by mechanisms of seduction,
# Redundancy of the Panoptical impulse brought about by the evident durability of the self-surveillance functions which partly constitute the normal, socialized, ‘Western’ subject,
# Reduction in the number of occasions of any conceivable need for Panoptical surveillance on account of simulation, prediction and action before the fact,
# Supplementation of the Panopticon by the Synopticon,
# Failure of Panoptical control to produce reliably docile subjects.

The first point concerns [[Zygmunt Bauman]]’s argument that the leading principle of social order has moved from Panopticism to seduction.

The second argument concerns surveillance redundance, and it is increasingly relevant in the age of [[Facebook]] and online self-disclosure.  Is the metaphor of a panopticon appropriate for voluntary surrender of privacy?{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The third argument for post-Panopticism, concerning action before the fact, is articulated by William Bogard:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The figure of the Panopticon is already haunted by a parallel figure of simulation.  Surveillance, we are told, is discreet, unobtrusive, camouflaged, unverifiable – all elements of artifice designed into an architectural arrangement of spaces to produce real effects of discipline. Eventually this will lead, by its means of perfection, to the elimination of the Panopticon itself . . . surveillance as its own simulation. Now it is no longer a matter of the speed at which information is gained to defeat an enemy. . . . Now, one can simulate a space of control, project an indefinite number of courses of action, train for each possibility, and react immediately with pre-programmed responses to the actual course of events . . . with simulation, sight and foresight, actual and virtual begin to merge. . . . Increasingly the technological enlargement of the field of perceptual control, the erasure of distance in the speed of electronic information has pushed surveillance beyond the very limits of speed toward the purest forms of anticipation.&lt;ref name=Bogard&gt;Bogard, W. (1996). The Simulation of Surveillance, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This kind of anticipation is particularly evident in emergent surveillance technologies such as [[social network analysis]].

The ‘Synopticon’ concerns the surveillance of the few by the many.&lt;ref name=Mathiesen&gt;Mathiesen, T. (1997) ‘The viewer society’, Theoretical Criminology 1(2).&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of this kind of surveillance may include the theatre, the Coliseum, and celebrity tabloid reporting.  This “reversal of the Panoptical polarity may have become so marked that it finally deconstructs the Panoptical metaphor altogether”.&lt;ref name=Boyne /&gt;

Finally, the fifth point concerns the self-defeating nature of Panoptical regimes.  The failure of surveillance states is illustrated by examples such as “prison riots, asylum sub-cultures, ego survival in Gulag or concentration camp, [and] retribalization in the Balkans.”&lt;ref name=Boyne /&gt;

In their 2007 article, Dobson and Fisher&lt;ref name=Dobson_Fisher&gt;Dobson, J. E., and P. F. Fisher. 2007. The Panopticon's changing geography. Geographical Review 97 (3): 307-323.&lt;/ref&gt; lay out an alternative model of post-panopticism as they identify three panoptic models.  Panopticism I refers to [[Jeremy Bentham]]’s original conceptualization of the panopticon, and is it the model of panopticism that Foucault responds to in his 1975 [[Discipline and Punish]].  Panopticism II refers to an [[Orwellian]] ‘Big Brother’ ideal of surveillance.  Panopticism III, the final model of panopticism, refers to the high-technology human tracking systems that are emergent in this 21st century.  These [[geographical information systems]] (GIS) include technologies such as cellphone GPS, [[RFID]]s (radio-frequency identification tags), and [[geo-fence]]s.  Panopticism III is also distinguished by its costs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Panopticon III is affordable, effective, and available to anyone who wants to use it. Initial purchase prices and monthly service fees are equivalent to cell-phone costs. In less than five years, the cost of continuous surveillance of a single individual has dropped from several hundred thousand dollars per year to less than $500 per year. Surveillance formerly justified solely for national security and high-stakes commerce is readily available to track a spouse, child, parent, employee, neighbor, or stranger.&lt;ref name=Dobson_Fisher /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Cornell University]] professor and information theorist Branden Hookway introduced the concept of a Panspectrons in 2000: an evolution of the panopticon to the effect that it does not define an object of surveillance more, but everyone and everything is monitored. The object is defined only in relation to a specific issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://uncommonculture.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1363/1282 | title=Tactical memory: The politics of openness in the construction of memory| journal=First Monday| volume=11| issue=7| date=2006-07-03| last1=Braman| first1=Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paris School (Security Studies)|Paris School]] academic [[Didier Bigo]] coined the term [[Banopticon|'Banopticon']] to describe a situation where profiling technologies are used to determine who to place under surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Bigo, Didier (2006), "Security, Exception, Ban and Surveillance.", in Lyon, David, ''Theorizing Surveillance.

'''Punya ''' ([[Sanskrit]]: पुण्य) is a difficult word to translate; there is no equivalent English word to convey its exact intended meaning. It is generally taken to mean 'saintly', virtue, 'holy', 'sacred', 'pure', 'good', 'meritorious', 'virtuous', 'righteous', 'just', 'auspicious', 'lucky', 'favourable', 'agreeable', 'pleasing', 'lovely', 'beautiful', 'sweet', 'fragrant', 'solemn' or 'festive', according to the context it is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=128|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.3.apte.2518608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Overview==
''Punya'' (पुण्य,) is referred to as good ''[[karma]]'' or a virtue that contributes benefits in this and the next birth and can be acquired by appropriate means and also accumulated. In [[Vedanta]] terms ''punya'' is the invisible wealth, a part of ''dharma'', the third human goal; the other two goals being ''artha'' and ''kama''. ''Punya'' and ''pāpa'' are the seeds of future pleasure and pain, the former, which sows merits, exhausts itself only through pleasure and the latter, which sows demerits, exhausts itself only through pain; but ''[[Moksha|Jiwan mukti]]'' ends all karmic debts consisting of and signified by these two dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Be Free from “Me”|author=Paul Bahder|publisher=Vision of Vedanta|page=|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=PdGwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT185&amp;dq=punya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=irvNVPzTPMze8AW284DoCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Vedic]] period, ''[[brahmacharya]]'' practiced by the [[Brahmin]]s was believed to ensure the desired gain of eternal life but owing to the changes in living patterns and increase in the demands of life, people veered towards Brahmaloka which the accumulation of merits of ''punya-karma'' ('good deeds or actions') seemed to promise and opted for the ''deva-yāna'' or 'the path of the gods'. The dynamics of ''karma'' played a large role in the development of [[Buddhist|Buddhist thought]]. The Buddhists believe that ''karma'' determines one’s nature and life-pattern but to them ''karma'' is ''chetnā'', a mental drive, a psychological phenomenon rather than a law governing substantial existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Karma and Rebirth|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=192, 194|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=iaRWtgXjplQC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=punya+indian+thought&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LvNVPbUC4bd8AXtmYKYCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya%20indian%20thought&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhists consider Punya as the extraordinary force that confers happiness, as a spiritual merit which is one of the ten forms of balas (sources of strength) to a bodhisattva. They hold the belief that charity leads to the accumulation of punya or a happier rebirth on earth or a long sojourn in heaven. Buddha-knowledge (enlightenment) transcends even the law of karma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Boddhisttava Doctrine in Buddhist Sanskrit Literature|author=Har Dayal|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=61, 148|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=uUveqp7lAVoC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=punya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KLvNVP__GNPk8AWM0IGACg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of ''[[Sthiti|Sthiti Bandha]]'' (duration-quality bondage), according to [[Jainism]], involves attachment of ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmic matter]]'' to the soul through ''anubhava bandha'' or ''rasa bandha'' which refers to the determination of the fruits of actions of the soul that such an attachment produces at the time of attachment of ''karmic matter'' or through ''pradesha bandha'' that deals with the quantum of ''karmic matter'' drawn towards the soul as determined by the soul’s actions. The ''karmic matter'' produced due to good activities of the mind, body and speech is the pleasant ''punya'' ('virtuous') ''karmic matter'' and that produced due to evil activities is the unpleasant ''pāpa'' ('sinful') ''karmic matter''. These ''karmas'' have to exhaust themselves to produce their results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jainism and Indian Civilization|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|page=50|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=LlqOvvJJnugC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=punya+indian+thought&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LvNVPbUC4bd8AXtmYKYCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya%20indian%20thought&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Nyaya|Nyāya School]] understands ''[[dharma]]'' and ''[[adharma]]'' to refer to ''punya'' and ''pāpa'', with ''punya'' relating to one’s own or others’ well-being and ''pāpa'' relating to harm done to others, or in terms of doing one’s duties and their violation; it connects ''dharma'' to well-being and duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophical Reflections|author=Ved Prakash Verma|publisher=Allied Publishers|page=43|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=3ol1hObCEwoC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=punya+upanishad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=173NVJaMGo7y8QW41YHgCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya%20upanishad&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[Karma]], with the idea of rebirth as the background, was effectively introduced into Indian thought by [[Yajnavalkya]] in the course of his discussion with Jāratkārva Ārtabhāga who wanted to know about what happens after death ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] III.ii.13), whether present actions matter in respect of the experience of the after-death state and how human efforts and ''karma'' are inter-related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Yoga|author=Georg Feurstein|publisher=Shambhala Publications|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Y1eDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT65&amp;dq=punya+upanishad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xrzNVKuFCIqF8gWP74CwCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya%20upanishad&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vedic|Vedic people]] were multi-religious and believed in the existence of heaven and hell and in the transmigration of souls. For them the performance of ''[[yajna]]'' was important, and no ''yajna'' was complete or fruitful without ''[[dakshina]]'' i.e. the fee to the priests, and ''[[dāna]]'' i.e. charity, both deemed meritorious acts or ''punya-karma''; they accepted the philosophy of sin (''pāpa'') and merit (''punya''). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ancient History of India: Vedic Period|author=K.C.Singhal|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|page=|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hoXqCmo-Xs8C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=punya+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_b7NVJP2N4zo8AX2vICYCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;


''Punya'' is a very ancient Sanskrit word which appears in the [[Rig veda]]. For instance, in a prayer to Kapinjala Ivendro Devata, Rishi Gutsamada, while describing the qualities of an ''upadeshaka'' ('teacher') states:
:उद्गातेव शकुने सं गायसि ब्रह्मपुत्रइव सवनेषु शंससि |
:वृषेव वाजी शिशुमतीरपीत्या सर्वतो नः शकुने भद्रमावद विश्वतो नः शकुने पुण्यमावद || - ([[Rig Veda]] II.43.2)
in which ''[[mantra]]'' the word, ''punya'', is used to mean - 'good' or 'auspicious' or 'happy'. Many other Vedic texts, such as [[Chandogya Upanishad]] (VIII.ii.6) – पुण्यजितो लोकः (in which phrase ''aja'' refers to the Brahmaloka), have used it as meaning 'agreeable' or 'happy'. Otherwise, in [[Sanskrit literature]], this word is used to indicate 'advantageous', 'good', 'convenient', 'beneficent' or 'purifying'; [[Manusmṛti]] also uses it meaning the same; however, the opposite of ''punya'' is ''apunya'', which means that the word, ''punya'' cannot at all places be translated as 'merit' or 'meritorious', more so because the word ''pāpa'' is most often translated as 'sin'. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religion, Philosophy, Yoga|author=Jean Filliozat|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=234-240|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2av2SuI8PpoC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=punya+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_b7NVJP2N4zo8AX2vICYCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya%20vedas&amp;f=false  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adi Shankara]] exclaims:-

:पुण्यानि पापानि निरिन्द्रयस्य निश्चेतसो निर्विकृतेः निराकृतेः |
:कुतो ममाखण्डसुखानुभूतेः ब्रूते ह्यनन्वागत मित्यपि श्रुतिः ||

:"How can there be for me puṇya and pāpa who am without organs, without mind, without change and without form? How can these pertain to me who enjoy infinite bliss? The ananvāgataśruti also declares that these will not attend on me." — [[Vivekachudamani]] (St.504)

In his commentary on this stanza, [[Chandrasekhara Bharati III|Śri Candraśekhara Bhāratī of Śringeri]] explains that ''punya'' is the outcome of doing prescribed works, and ''pāpa'', the prohibited. All works pertaining to the body, to the mind and to speech are ''karma'', the good and bad with reference to actions make for ''punya'' and ''pāpa'' respectively; all actions and their outcome relate to the mind or to the body with form possessing sense-organs. The infinite bliss that Shankara speaks of is the ''sukha'' not generated by connection with sense-objects and therefore, in its experience there is no grief, no superimposition and no imagination whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri Candrasekhara Bharati of Srngeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=128|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/vivekacudamani-of-sri-samkara-bhagvatpata-with-an-english-translation-of-the-commentary-in-samskrt-by-jagadguru-sri-candrasekhara-bharati-svaminah-sri-samkaracarya-of-sarada-pitha-srngeri/oclc/633667305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Vedic period speaking untruth was a sin, and false accusers were the real sinners; performance of ''[[yajna]]'' washed away all such sins, which means ritual acts were associated with morality. Untruth and impurity could be washed away by water or wiped away by Darbha grass. Along with the concept of [[Ṛta|Rta]] (righteousness) there was the more prominent concept of ''anrta'', the opposite of righteousness or untruth; terms for good and evil were developed and a wicked person was called ''pāpa'', where after from the term, ''sādhu'' denoting what was right, was the concept of ''punya'' developed. Yajnavalkya explains – 

:यथाचारी यथाचारी तथा भवति साधुकारी साधुर्भवति, पापकारी पापो भवति पुण्यः पुण्येन कर्मणा भवति, पापः पापेन |  

:"As it (the self) does and acts, so it becomes; by doing good it becomes good, and by doing evil it becomes evil." - ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] (IV.iv.5)

In his commentary, Shankara states that the 'doing good' referred to here is the prescribed conduct (scriptural injunctions and prohibitions), actions are not prescribed for acts, good or evil prompted by desire and the cause of identification and transmigration, do not require habitual performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Religion and Philosophy of the Vedas and Upanishads|author=A.B.Keith|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=477-479|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=p9zCbRMQbyEC&amp;pg=PA479&amp;dq=punya++upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ADrQVOnbNMPs8AWam4L4CQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya%20%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Pyrrhic victory''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Pyrrhic victory.ogg|ˈ|p|ɪr|ɪ|k|}} {{respell|PIRR|ik}}) is a victory that inflicts such a devastating toll on the victor that it is tantamount to defeat. Someone who wins a Pyrrhic victory has also taken a heavy toll that negates any true sense of achievement.   

==Etymology==

''Pyrrhic victory'' is named after King [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], whose army suffered irreplaceable casualties in defeating the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] at the [[Battle of Heraclea]] in 280 BC and the [[Battle of Asculum]] in 279 BC, during the [[Pyrrhic War]]. After the latter battle, [[Plutarch]] relates in a report by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]]:

{{quote|The armies separated; and, it is said, Pyrrhus replied to one that gave him joy of his victory that ''one other such victory would utterly undo him''. For he had lost a great part of the forces he brought with him, and almost all his particular friends and principal commanders; there were no others there to make recruits, and he found the confederates in Italy backward. On the other hand, as from a fountain continually flowing out of the city, the Roman camp was quickly and plentifully filled up with fresh men, not at all abating in courage for the loss they sustained, but even from their very anger gaining new force and resolution to go on with the war.|Plutarch, [[Parallel Lives|Life of Pyrrhus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]] (trans. John Dryden) ''[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/pyrrhus.html Pyrrhus]'', hosted on [http://classics.mit.edu The Internet Classics Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In both Epirote victories, the Romans suffered greater casualties but they had a much larger pool of replacements, so the casualties had less impact on the Roman war effort than the losses of King Pyrrhus.

The report is often quoted as
{{quote|text=''Ne ego si iterum eodem modo uicero, sine ullo milite Epirum reuertar.''&lt;br&gt;
Another such victory and I come back to Epirus alone.|source=[[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/orosius/orosius4.shtml#1 Historiarum Adversum Paganos Libri]'', IV, 1.15.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
or 
{{quote|text=If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined.|source=

Ironically enough, it can never fairly be said that Pyrrhus of Epirus ever incurred such a "victory", having handily defeated the Romans in each of their engagements by a large margin,  all the while suffering substantially fewer casualties (see, for example, the [[Battle of Heraclea]]). The term entered the English vernacular due to popular misconceptions of the magnitude of Pyrrhus's losses: beginning before the 1800s, Latin history teaching books said that Pyrrhus suffered losses in the tens of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Study_of_History_Rendered_Easy_by_a.html?id=tklHMwEACAAJ | title = The Study of History Rendered Easy, by a Plan Founded on Experience | first1 = Ann | last1 = Fletcher | first2 = S. | last2 = Dutton | first3 = H.F. | last3 = Dutton | publisher = University of St. Andrews | year = 1798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="978">A '''recycling cooperative''' is an industrial [[cooperative]], co-owned and maintained by either workers or consumers, which specializes in the [[recycling]] of various materials. Such cooperatives are either [[non-profit]] or [[not-for-profit]]; a major theoretical benefit of mass co-ownership is that raw recycled materials can become increasingly and equally distributed among the membership population at a low cost, be it for reusage at home or for reusage in the manufacturing of newer goods or versions of goods to be sold to customers at cheaper prices than would be possible with freshly obtained raw materials. A subset is the '''business recycling cooperative''', which, according to the [[Northeast Recycling Council]], is a group of business in a particular region, which separate recyclable waste, usually produced by their own functions, for prearranged collection by a shared hauler.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28980">[[File:Latin_America_(orthographic_projection).svg|thumb|Latin America is a predominantly Spanish
speaking and predominantly [[Roman Catholic]] region]]
While feminist movements became prevalent in Europe and North America in the 1960s and 1970s, the women of [[Latin America]] were gathering to oppose dictatorships and civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fernandez Anderson|first=Cora|title=The Politics of Abortion in Latin America|url=http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/07/17/the-politics-of-abortion-in-latin-america/|work=RH Reality Check}}&lt;/ref&gt; As democracy began to spread across the region, feminist movements gradually began to push for more reproductive rights.

In the 1990s, many of the groups that made up the women's movement began to evolve in order to adapt to a changing political climate. These groups focused on specific policy issues, such as [[abortion]], and were not composed exclusively of civil society actors. During this same time period, [[opposition to abortion|anti-abortion activism]] was also beginning to gain momentum. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] replaced hundreds of progressive clergy and summarily repressed discussions of reproductive issues. Groups continuing to fight for legal abortion across the region have faced a strong resistance from the [[Catholic church]] as well as the religious right in the [[United States]]. Although a majority of countries within the region are officially secular, the church continues to have an extensive influence within the region due to Latin America being the largest Catholic region in the world. The [[Christian right|religious right]] in the United States holds substantial clout over the political right in its own country, which has resulted in the United States banning federal funding for international NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pothecary|first=Sam|title=Abortion Rights in Latin America: A Tale of Varying Woes|url=http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/19272-abortion-rights-in-latin-america-a-tale-of-varying-woes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considerably damaging to groups in Latin America was [[Ronald Reagan]]'s 1984 [[Mexico City Policy|Global Gag Rule]] which prohibited international organizations receiving US federal funds from performing or promoting [[abortion]] as a method of [[family planning]].

Latin America is home to some of the few countries of the world with a complete ban on abortion, without an exception for saving [[maternal mortality|maternal life]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41005517&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining reproductive rights ==
During the [[Cold War]], reproductive restrictions were directed at controlling [[overpopulation]] through technocratic regulatory mechanisms and vertical population control campaigns. The United Nations International Conference on Population and Development of 1994 held in Cairo, Egypt established the first global agenda for sexual and reproductive health and rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual and Reproductive Health|url=http://www.ghwatch.org/sites/www.ghwatch.org/files/B4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agreement marked a paradigm shift away from a narrow approach based on delivery of services and numbers rather than well-being. It placed rights at the center of population and development and defined reproductive health as "a state of complete, physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease of infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes." This broader approach to reproductive health moved the Cairo Agenda into political and economic debates over access and rights to knowledge, resources, and appropriate services.

Thus, women and health movements in civil society and their allies in the United Nations and national bureaucracies have undertaken strong campaigns to link public health, gender equality, and development policy. By understanding reproductive rights in the broader context of human rights, governments are able to create a standard of health that ensures development.&lt;ref name=":66"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raguz|first=Maria|date=2001|title=Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Rights in Latin America|jstor=4065364|journal=Health and Human Rights|volume=5|pages=30–63|doi=10.2307/4065364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, this broader understanding of reproductive health places a certain level of responsibility on the government in ensuring this aspect of health for its citizens.

This cross-cultural consensus focuses on the importance of one particular capability, that of bodily health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|title=Promoting Women's Capabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recognizing the many areas reproductive health has influence over serves to exemplify its importance as well as gives some understanding as to what necessary improvements need to be made to a society.

Reproductive health also encompasses knowledge production and knowledge consumption. In order to obtain reproductive rights, quality information and services must be made available to all citizens of a society.&lt;ref name=":66"/&gt;

== Current strategies ==

=== International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) ===
The 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]] defined reproductive health as noted above. It also defined strategies and goals for advancing such reproductive health and rights in Latin America through what is called the [[Reproductive rights|Cairo Programme of Action]] (CPA). The CPA has three quantitative targets: (1) Reducing overall mortality, which implies an increase in life expectancy, reducing specific mortalities (2) Universal access to education, especially for girls (3) Universal access to [[reproductive health services]], including [[family planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean: Review of the period 2009-2013 and lessons learned|url=http://www.eclac.cl/publicaciones/xml/2/50562/CRPDSummary.pdf|publisher=Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adopted by the region at the conference, some improvements have been seen since the adoption of the CPA. Reproductive rights have become recognized in the constitutions of [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Emma|author2=Anne-Emanuelle Birn |title=Sexual and Reproductive health and rights in Latin America: an analysis of trends, commitments and achievements|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|year=2011|pages=183–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Environmental Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean Ad Hoc Committee on Population and Development is responsible for official follow-up to the implementation of the CPA in [[Latin America]] as well as the [[Caribbean]].

=== Millennium Development Goals in Latin America ===
The [[Millennium Development Goals]] are a descriptive framework by which to monitor response to eight specific goals. They were announced in the [[Millennium Declaration]] in September 2000. Whether or not a country is on track to meeting these goals—in the case of Latin America—is tracked by the [[Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]] (ECLAC). One particular goal in regard to reproductive health, Goal 5, seeks to improve maternal health within the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDG Goals, targets and indicators|url=http://www.cepal.org/cgi-bin/getProd.asp?xml=/mdg/noticias/paginas/7/35557/P35557.xml&amp;xsl=/mdg/tpl/p18f-st.xsl&amp;base=/mdg/tpl-i/top-bottom.xsl|work=Millennium Development Goals in Latin America and the Caribbean|publisher=Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first target of Goal 5 is to reduce the [[maternal mortality]] ratio by three quarters between 1990 and 2015. In order to assess the progress towards this goal, ECLAC monitors maternal mortality ratios and the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel. The second target of Goal 5 is to achieve universal access to reproductive health by 2015. This target is assessed by viewing contraceptive prevalence rates, adolescent birth rates, antenatal care coverage and percentages of unmet need for family planning. In order to achieve these goals, many actions have been taken, including the growing institutionalization of deliveries and the increased number of personnel trained to provide care during childbirth and emergency obstetric care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maternal Mortality in Central America: The need to accelerate efforts by 2035|url=http://www.mhtf.org/tag/latin-america/|work=The Maternal Health Task Force|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429080613/http://www.mhtf.org/tag/latin-america/|archivedate=2014-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maternal health and mortality ==
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2010, about 9,200 women are dying annually from pregnancy-related causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kulczycki|first=Andrzej|title=Abortion in Latin America: Changes in Practice, Growing Conflict, and Recent Policy Developments|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=21 September 2011|volume=42|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deaths have a variety of causes that can occur as a result of complications during and following pregnancy and childbirth. The World Health Organization estimates that around 80% of all maternal deaths are a result of severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy and unsafe abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maternal Mortality|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report by the Guttmacher Institute, more than 20% of women who gave birth in 2008 did not make the recommended four  antenatal visits and 13% did not deliver in a health facility.

None of the Latin American countries will reach the Millennium Development goal target specifically for maternal mortality, as well as it continues to be both a health and social challenge in Latin America. Research indicates that the numbers are disproportionately high within the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] and afro-descendant populations among the very poor. For indigenous populations as well as adolescents and young people, the rate of unmet family planning need also remains high. Latin America has the second highest [[fertility rates]] among adolescents and the highest unsafe abortion rates in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latin America and the Caribbean|url=http://icpdbeyond2014.org/pages/view/4-latin-america-and-the-caribbean|work=International Conference on Population and Development Beyond 201|publisher=International Conference on Population and Development Beyond 201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the maternal mortality rate in Latin America is relatively low compared to other regions with a rate of 80 deaths per 100,000 live births. However, if one were to break down the region's mortality rate by country, one could easily demonstrate that there exists a large disparity between affluent and poor countries. For example, in Haiti the rate was closer to 350 deaths per 100,000 live births. The disparity between wealthy and poor areas likely exists due to the differences in access to services and skilled professionals. Women in the highest income quintile have far easier access to such health services than women in the lowest income quintile. The same class-based disparity exists when analyzing the use of contraceptive  methods.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Adolescent maternity and reproductive health ===
Protecting the health of adolescents is an important public health priority. Increased investment in adolescent reproductive health contributes to improving the overall status of women as well as the reduction in poverty among families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts on the Sexual and Reproductive Health of Adolescent Women in the Developing World|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-Adolescents-SRH.pdf|work=Guttmacher Institute|publisher=International Planned Parenthood Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescent health must be contextualized within reproductive health and thus public health. Latin American government as a whole did not recognize early pregnancy in adolescents to be an issue until 1984 during the International Conference on Population in Mexico City.&lt;ref name=":66"/&gt;

In Latin America, 38% of women become pregnant before the age of 20 and almost 20% of births are to teenage mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maternal Health: A Priority to Ensure the Health and Rights of Women|url=http://www.ippfwhr.org/en/speech/maternal-health-priority-ensure-health-and-rights-women|publisher=International Planned Parenthood Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year there are estimated to be 1.2 million unintended pregnancies among adolescent women living in Latin America and the Caribbean. Although overall fertility rates have largely dropped within the region, adolescent maternity is following an opposite trend. The Gender Equality Observatory for Latin America and the Caribbean reports that as of 2011, in [[Nicaragua]] approximately 2 in 10 women between the ages of 15 and 19 is a mother. In places such as [[Chile]], [[Mexico]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Peru]] the percentage is close to 12% while in [[Belize]], [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]] and [[El Salvador]] reach percentages close to 15%. Inequality is also present in the issue of adolescent maternity, with pregnancy rates being three to five times higher among poor adolescents.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} While an overall universal trend towards earlier average age of menstruation can be seen, the mean age of marriage has declined. This implies that adolescents who are coerced into marriage are unprotected in terms of reproductive rights for longer periods of time.&lt;ref name=":66"/&gt;

According to the [[United Nations Population Fund|UN Population Fund]], education and access to information and services young people need in order to make responsible decisions remains insufficient. The importance of education is exemplified by how girls in Latin America who have completed only up to primary education or less have a higher probability of adolescent pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":66"/&gt; Further, many young girls are dying because their bodies cannot support pregnancies. The same fund reports that the risk of complications during pregnancy and delivery for girls aged 15 to 19 is double the rate for women in their 20s, and five times as high for girls under 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgerton|first=Anna|author2=Ina Sotirova |title=Sex and the Barrio: A Clash of Faith in Latin America|journal=World Policy Journal|issue=Winter 2011/2012 Faith Issue|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/winter2011/sex-and-the-barrio}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Research reveals that there are several major barriers that young people face to accessing [[contraception]], primarily with acquiring services. For example, facilities are frequently in areas inaccessible to young individuals. Due to a lack of information, adolescents often incorrectly use or do not use contraceptives at all.&lt;ref name=":66"/&gt; For the purpose of privacy from their communities and families, young persons often seek services from facilities not located directly in their own neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moya|first=Cecilia|title=Improving Youth's Access to Contraception in Latin America|url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/publications/517?task=view|work=Advocates for Youth|publisher=Advocates for Youth}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are also legal barriers preventing youth's access. Many policies limit or prohibit confidential services for youths.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

There is also a swath of data that is not collected by hospitals on abortions that are particularly "clandestine" / "backstreet". Studies have shown that in several Latin American countries, young single women are at a high risk for abortion which is not reflected by the amount of married, older women who were hospitalized for abortions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strickler|first=Jennifer, et al|date=2001|title=Clandestine Abortion in Latin America: A Clinic Profile|jstor=2673803|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives|volume=27|pages=34–36|doi=10.2307/2673803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from a lack of information, young people who seek contraception are often denied by health workers acting out of their own moral convictions. It is clear that religious attitudes are very much present in society, which often deters young persons from seeking reproductive services and contraception.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Family Planning ==

=== Contraceptives ===

Use of modern contraceptives has increased to 62.5% (CITE: Population action) giving the region as a whole the highest contraceptive prevalence rate in the developing world. The increased uptake of sexual and reproductive health and family planning services has resulted in a marked drop in total [[fertility]] rates from approximately 4.6 children per woman in the 1970s to about 2.5 in 2013. 
In Latin America, multiple court decisions have granted personhood to fertilized eggs. These court decisions have been responsible for the extreme restrictions on access to emergency contraception within the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Access to EC in Latin America Takes Center Stage at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights|url=http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/access-to-EC-in-Latin-America-at-IACHR|work=Center For Reproductive Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The legal status of [[oral contraception]] in Latin America varies by country. In 2009 [[Honduras]] banned the free distribution and sale of emergency contraceptives That same year, the [[Constitutional Court of Peru]] ordered the [[Ministry of Health (Peru)|Health Ministry]] to refrain from distributing [[Emergency contraception|emergency contraceptives]] to the public sector. In [[Costa Rica]], where emergency contraceptives are not blatantly prohibited, the popular emergency contraceptive levonorgestrel is not registered as a product, which impedes access to the drug from within the public health system as well as the private market.  
Although the remaining countries in the region allow for the free distribution of emergency contraceptives, they do not have uniform regulations. In [[Chile]], [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]], the right to have access to emergency contraceptives is recognized. In [[Nicaragua]] and [[Bolivia]], the protocols of their respective health ministries are essentially law. In Argentina and Brazil, the distribution of emergency contraceptives is not legally recognized except in protocols and informative guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hevia|first=Martin|title=The legal status of emergency contraception in Latin America|journal=International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics|year=2012|pages=87–90|url=http://www.ossyr.org.ar/pdf/bibliografia/190.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abortion ===
{{See|Category:Abortion by country}}Abortion is a highly controversial aspect of reproductive rights. While every country in Latin America has differing laws and regulations regarding abortion, the general sentiment is that of disapproval. Abortions in Latin America have had a history of being unsafe and illegal (especially for poor women), with recent improvements in both of those areas.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kulczycki|first=A|date=2011|title=Abortion in Latin America: Changes in Practice, Growing Conflict, and Recent Policy Developments.|url=|journal=Studies in Family Planning|volume=42|pages=199–220|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.2011.00282.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these improvements can be attributed to modern contraception, emergency care, as well as education. Similarly, advocacy and national conflict has grown surrounding abortion rights in Latin America. The region has seen a steady increase of feminist abortion activists, despite religion making the issue taboo.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Even when legislation has become more lenient (as has been the case recently with Mexico City and Chile), women often face institutional barriers to gaining access to abortions. When it comes to reporting data on abortions in Latin America, estimated abortion levels are often heterogeneous and highly variable due to legal frameworks and social stigmas.

According to the World Health Organization, in 2008, approximately "4.2 million abortions were conducted in Latin America and the Caribbean, almost three-fourths of them in South America. Virtually all these procedures were illegal and many were unsafe."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In 2011, the number of [[unsafe abortion]]s in Latin America rose to 4.2 million annually. Unsafe abortions account for a large proportion of [[maternal death]]s. For example, in [[Argentina]] [[unsafe abortions]] account for 31% of the maternal mortality rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caivano|first=Joan|author2=Jane Marcus-Delgado|title=Time for Change: Reproductive rights in Latin America in the 21st Century|journal=Reproductive Laws for the 21st Century Papers|date=May 2012|url=http://centerwomenpolicy.org/programs/health/statepolicy/documents/REPRO_Time_for_Change.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307200146/http://www.centerwomenpolicy.org/programs/health/statepolicy/documents/REPRO_Time_for_Change.pdf|archivedate=2014-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin America abortion is:&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160415084202/http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/WorldAbortionPolicies2013/WorldAbortionPolicies2013_WallChart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*completely prohibited: El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua 
*allowed only to save the mother's life: Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay, Venezuela,
*allowed only to save the mother's life and in case of rape: Brazil 
*allowed only to save the mother's life or health: Costa Rica, Peru, Ecuador (and rape of [[disabled]] woman)
*allowed only to save the mother's life and in case of rape or fetal malformation: Chile (since 2017), Panama
*allowed only to save the mother's life or health, and in case of rape: Argentina, Bolivia
*allowed only to save the mother's life or health, and in case of rape, or fetal malformation: Colombia
*allowed on request: Cuba, Uruguay, Mexico City (in Mexico law varies by state)

Only two countries within Latin America allow for legal abortion without restriction. However, these countries are home to less than 5% of women between the ages of 15-44. According to a report released by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], 95% of abortions in Latin America are unsafe. Nearly one million women are hospitalized each year because of complications from unsafe abortion. Overall, Latin American rates of death related to illegal abortions rank among the highest in the world.

Strict abortion laws are accompanied by strict punishments. In El Salvador, for example, a woman can be jailed for up to 40 years for aborting while in Mexico, she could be jailed for up to 50 years. These punishments do not take into consideration the cause of the pregnancy, due to the fact that many of the imprisoned women were raped or had involuntary abortions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.internationalhealthpolicies.org/the-right-to-health-and-safe-abortion-in-latin-america-still-a-long-way-to-go/|title=The right to health and safe abortion in Latin America: still a long way to go|date=2017-09-29|work=IHP|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International legislations also have an effect on abortion rights in Latin America. When U.S. President Donald Trump reinstated the Global Gag Rule on January 23, 2017, he prohibited all U.S. federal money from funding international organizations such as NGOs that "perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theglobalamericans.org/2017/03/global-gag-rule-womens-health-risk-latin-america/|title=The global gag rule: Women’s health at risk in Latin America?|work=Global Americans|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that abortion regulations are already extremely strict in Latin America, this legislation disproportionately affects Latin American organizations that try to provide abortion services to women either legally, or illegally.

=== Comprehensive Sexual Education ===

In 2012 a report presented to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) found that access to information remains a significant roadblock to sexual and reproductive health, particularly in Latin America.(CITE HR BRIEF) The report noted that even when a state has a comprehensive legal framework guaranteeing access to information, in practice the individual's health is endangered by uninformed decisions made by individuals and policymakers based on inadequate information regarding sexual and reproductive health. In 2011, IACHR issued a report on access to information on reproductive health and found that the situation is compounded when women are poor, indigenous, of African descent, live in a rural area, or are a migrant.

In 2008, the region adopted "Miniseria Declaration, 'Prevention through Education,'" in response to a lack of comprehensive sexuality education. While there have been some setbacks and delays regarding implementation, there have also been key improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Sex Education Successes in Latin America|url=http://www.ippfwhr.org/en/blog/five-sex-education-successes-latin-america|work=International Planned Parenthood Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the ministries of health and education of Guatemala reaffirmed their commitment to working together in order to ensure the goals of the Ministerial Declaration are the met. In addition, the government of Guatemala is implementing a comprehensive sexuality education program for young people in nine regions of the country. Actions aimed at promoted comprehensive sexual education can be seen in multiple areas of the region, demonstrating that leaders are indeed dedicated to making such improvements. Earlier in 2012, Costa Rica adopted a national sexuality program for the first time in history. The curriculum approaches human sexuality in a comprehensive way; it includes lessons on human rights, gender equality, power, interpersonal communication, respect for diversity and pleasure. Also making a critical first step that year was El Salvador with its General Youth Act, legislation which recognizes and guarantees the right of young persons to receive comprehensive sex education. Implementation will be an ongoing challenge, however, recognition is important step toward meeting the needs of youth.

==Religion in Latin America==
{{See|Religion in Latin America|Catholic Church in Latin America}}
Religion in Latin America is characterized by the predominance of [[Roman Catholicism]], although there is also increasing [[Protestantism|Protestant]] influence (especially in Central America and Brazil) as well as by the presence of other world religions. Catholicism was introduced in Latin America with the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] and continued through the independence movements of the Spanish-American colonies up to the present day. Critics of the restrictive abortion laws of Latin America argue that this situation is created by the strong influence of  the Catholic church in the region.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/27/abortion-rights-latin-america&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abortion in El Salvador|El Salvador]] and [[Abortion in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]] have drawn international attention for strong enforcement of their complete bans on abortion. In 2017, [[Abortion in Chile|Chile]] relaxed its total ban, allowing abortion to be performed when the woman's life is in danger, when a fetus is unviable, or in cases of rape.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/chile-the-long-road-to-abortion-reform-a7917791.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Influence ==
While many of Latin America's reforms in regards to reproductive rights have happened internally, the broader international community plays an important role as well. The [[Center for Reproductive Rights]], for example, has used international litigation as a way to reinforce national legislation surrounding reproductive rights.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabal, et al.|first=Louisa|date=2003|title=What Role Can International Litigation Play in the Promotion and Advancement of Reproductive Rights in Latin America?|jstor=4065417|journal=Health and Human Rights|volume=7|pages=50–88|doi=10.2307/4065417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal policy plays an important role in establishing a standard of reproductive rights internationally as well as within Latin America itself. This implies that over time, reproductive rights will be integrated into a broader framework of human rights.

==Education==
Bullock was born in [[Guantanamo Bay, Cuba]], and grew up outside of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].  He received his B.A. in economics and philosophy from [[Grove City College]] and his law degree from the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Law]].&lt;ref name="twsBio"/&gt; Bullock joined the [[Institute for Justice]] at its founding in 1991.&lt;ref name="twsBio"/&gt;

==Career==
Bullock was lead co-counsel in the 2005 Supreme Court case ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]]''.&lt;ref name="twsCSMonitor2"/&gt; After the decision by the high court to allow the [[New London, Connecticut|City of New London]] to seize the homes and businesses of current residences to make room for a "90-acre office, hotel, and housing complex", Bullock said that it was "a sad day for the country and a sad day for the Constitution."&lt;ref name="twsCSMonitor2"/&gt;

Bullock has advocated against government use of [[Civil forfeiture in the United States|civil forfeiture]].&lt;ref name="twsNJDotCom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsUSAToday1"/&gt; He has said that when the police pull drivers over for minor traffic infractions and seize their cash, they do not "respect fundamental notions of due process."&lt;ref name="twsWashPost4"/&gt; He represented Russ Caswell when the police tried to seize Caswell's motel in [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts]] after incidents of illegal drug activity on the premises.&lt;ref name="twsWallStreetJournal3"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6815">In [[psychology]], the '''Simon effect''' is the finding that [[reaction time]]s are usually faster, and reactions are usually more accurate, when the [[stimulation|stimulus]] occurs in the same relative location as the [[Stimulus (psychology)|response]], even if the stimulus location is irrelevant to the task. It is named for [[J. R. Simon]] who first published the effect in the late 1960s. Simon's original explanation for the effect was that there is ''an innate tendency to respond toward the source of stimulation''.

According to the simple models of [[information processing]] that existed at the time, there are three stages of processing: stimulus identification, response selection, and response execution or the motor stage. The Simon Effect is generally thought to involve interference which occurs in the response-selection stage. This is similar to, yet distinct from, the interference that produces the better-known [[Stroop effect]].

== Original experiment ==
In Simon's original study, two lights (the stimulus) were placed on a rotating circular panel. This device would be rotated at varying degrees (away from the horizontal plane). Simon wished to see if an alteration of the spatial relationship, relative to the response keys, affected performance. Age was also a probable factor in reaction time. As predicted the reaction time of the groups increased based on the relative position of the light stimulus (age was not a factor). The reaction time increased by as much as 30%. (Simon &amp; Wolf, 1963).

However, what is usually seen as the first genuine demonstration of the effect that became known as the Simon effect is by Simon &amp; Rudell (1967). Here, they had participants respond to the words "left" and "right" that were randomly presented to the left or right ear. Although the auditory location was completely irrelevant to the task, participants showed marked increases in reaction latency if the location of the stimulus was not the same as the required response (if, for example, they were to react left to a word that was presented in the right ear).

== Method ==

A typical demonstration of the Simon effect involves placing a participant in front of a [[computer monitor]] and a panel with two buttons on it, which he or she may press. The participant is told that they should press the button on the right when they see something red appear on the screen, and the button on the left when they see something green. Participants are usually told to ignore the location of the stimulus and base their response on the task-relevant color.

Participants typically react faster to red lights that appear on the right hand side of the screen by pressing the button on the right of their panel (congruent trials). Reaction times are typically slower when the red stimulus appears on the left hand side of the screen and the participant must push the button on the right of their panel (incongruent trials). The same, but vice versa, is true for the green stimuli.

This happens despite the fact that the position of the stimulus on the screen relative to the physical position of the buttons on the panel is irrelevant to the task and not correlated with which response is correct. The task, after all, requires the subject to note only the colour of the object (i.e., red or green) by pushing the corresponding button, and not its position on the screen.

== Explanation ==

According to Simon himself (1969), the location of the stimulus, although irrelevant to the task, directly influences response-selection due to an automatic tendency to 'react towards the source of the stimulation'. Although other accounts have been suggested (cf. Hommel, 1993), explanations for the Simon effect generally refer back to the interference that occurs in the response-selection stage of decision making. Neurologically there could be involvement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as the [[Anterior cingulate cortex]], which is thought to be responsible for conflict monitoring. The Simon Effect shows that location information cannot be ignored and will affect decision making, even if the participant knows that the information is irrelevant.

Logical argument for response selection:

The challenge in the Simon effect is said to occur during the response selection stage of judgment. This is due to two factors which eliminate the stimulus identification stage and the execution state. In the stimulus identification stage the participant only needs to be cognitively aware that a stimulus is present. An error would not occur at this stage unless he or she were [[visually impaired]] or had some sort of stimulus deficit. As well, an error or delay cannot occur during the execution state because an action has already been decided upon in the previous stage (the response selection stage) and no further decision making takes place (i.e. you cannot make a change to your response without going back to the second stage).

== Practical implications ==

A knowledge of the Simon effect is useful in the design of man-machine interfaces. [[Aircraft]] cockpits, for example, require a person to react quickly to a situation. If a pilot is flying a plane and there is a problem with the left engine, an aircraft with a good man-machine interface design (which most have) would position the indicator light for the left engine to the left of the indicator light for the right engine. This interface would display information in a way that matches the types of responses that people should make. If it were the other way around, the pilot might be more likely to respond incorrectly and adjust the wrong engine.

The '''Singapore Kindness Movement''' is a non-profit organization that executes public education programs aimed at cultivating kindness and graciousness in [[Singapore]]an society. It was officially launched in 1997. The movement serves as the successor to the Singapore Courtesy Council that oversaw the [[National Courtesy Campaign (Singapore)]] from the 1980s through the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_162_2004-12-30.html | title=Courtesy Campaign | accessdate=2011-01-11 | author=Lim, Siew Yeen | publisher=National Library Board Singapore | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820041841/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_162_2004-12-30.html | archivedate=2011-08-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM) was initiated in response to Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]]’s call to Singaporeans to develop into a more caring and gracious society in the new century.

In his 1996 New Year’s address, stated "We have become a [[Developed country|developed economy]] because we put our minds to it and strive hard to reach our goals. Let us now complement our economic achievements with social, cultural, and spiritual development. Then by the 21st century, Singapore will be a truly successful, mature country, with a developed economy and a gracious society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Social behaviour must match prosperity, says PM | date=1 January 1996 | publisher=The Straits Times | pages=Page 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PM Goh announced the SKM pilot project in July 1996, when he launched the Singapore Courtesy Campaign.Some 2,000 students from the uniformed groups in 20 secondary schools participated in the pilot project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Always In Season, A Harvest of Kindness Stories | author=Dr Lee Tzu Pheng | year=2000 | publisher=MITA:Singapore Kindness Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Movement was launched in January 1997, to over 80,000 secondary school students. SKM officially registered as a non-profit society on 31 January 1997. In March 2001, the National Courtesy Campaign was subsumed by the Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Soon, courtesy will be part of kindness. | date=January 13, 2001 | publisher=The Straits Times | pages=Home, p. 2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore Kindness Movement held the secretariat of the [[World Kindness Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldkindness.org.sg/about.html | title=World Kindness Movement- About Us | accessdate=2011-01-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117105010/http://www.worldkindness.org.sg/about.html | archivedate=2009-11-17 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2003-2012.

== Organizational goals ==
The mission statement of the SKM is to inspire graciousness through spontaneous acts of kindness, making life more pleasant for everyone.&lt;ref name="SKMAbout"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.kindness.sg/about/about-skm |title=Singapore Kindness Movement |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505210220/http://kindness.sg/about/about-skm |archivedate=2010-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main objectives are:
To encourage all Singaporeans to be more kind and considerate.
To enhance public awareness of acts of kindness.
To influence and raise the standards of social behaviour in our society.&lt;ref name="SKMAbout" /&gt;

== Structure ==
The SKM organisational structure consists of two main parts: The SKM Council (SKMC) and the SKM Secretariat. The SKM Council comprises members from the private and 19 public sectors.&lt;ref name="SKMAbout" /&gt; In March 2001, the Singapore Courtesy Council integrated with the SKMC.

The Movement is supported by the [[Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth]] and funded by a government grant. SKM also secures funds through its membership subscriptions and sponsorships.

The patron of the Movement is Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] and the current Chairman is Koh Poh Tiong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.gov.sg/public/sgpc/en/media_releases/agencies/mica-nrd/press_release/P-20080626-1.print.html?AuthKey= | title=Changing of guard at SKM | accessdate=2011-01-11 | author=Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718072207/http://www.news.gov.sg/public/sgpc/en/media_releases/agencies/mica-nrd/press_release/P-20080626-1.print.html?AuthKey= | archivedate=2011-07-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two strokes and ovals of the Singapore Kindness Movement logo depicts two people—one who does an act of kindness and the other who receives it. The freehand strokes combine to form a heart. Red symbolises love for your fellow man and green represents caring for the environment, tolerance, creativity, and consideration.

Singa the Lion had been the official mascot of the Singapore Kindness Movement until May, 2013. On 15 May 2013, Singa the Lion was retired from the campaign through an open "resignation letter" posted on the movement's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kindness.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/singaletter2.jpg | title=Subject : Open Letter to Singapore - I Quit | publisher=Singapore Kindness Movement. | work=Singa resigns | accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Singa the Courtesy Lion: I quit|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20130515-422664.html|accessdate=15 May 2013|newspaper=Asiaone|date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''snuff film''', or '''snuff movie''', is "a movie in a purported genre of movies in which a person is actually [[murder]]ed or commits [[suicide]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[American Heritage Dictionary]], ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt; It may or may not be made for financial gain, but is supposedly "circulated amongst a jaded few for the purpose of entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Snuff films false |url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/snuff.asp |date=October 31, 2006 |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some filmed records of executions and murders exist, but in those cases, the death was not specifically staged for financial gain or entertainment.&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/snuff.htm|title=Barbara Mikkelson, "A Pinch of Snuff", Snopes.com, 31 Oct 2006, accessed 8 April 2007|work=snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first known use of the term ''snuff movie'' is in a 1971 book by [[Ed Sanders]], ''The Family: The Story of Charles Manson's Dune Buggy Attack Battalion''. He alleges that [[Charles Manson|The Manson Family]] was involved in making such a film in California to record their murders.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LloT4dmu7xMC extract from book]&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun ''snuff'' originally meant the part of a candle wick that has already burned; the verb ''snuff'' meant to cut this off, and by extension to extinguish or kill.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1st ed, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; The word has been used in this sense in English slang for hundreds of years. It was defined in 1874 as a "term very common among the lower orders of London, meaning to die from disease or accident".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Camden Hotten]], ''[[A Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words]]'', 5th edition&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Geoffrey O'Brien]], "whether or not commercially distributed 'snuff' movies actually exist, the possibility of such movies is implicit in the stock [[B-movie]] motif of the mad artist killing his models, as in ''[[A Bucket of Blood]]'' [1959], ''[[Color Me Blood Red]]'' [1965], or ''Decoy for Terror'' [1967]" also known as ''Playgirl Killer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Geoffrey O’Brien|O’Brien, Geoffrey]] |date=1993|title=Horror for Pleasure|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]}} (April 22 issue), n.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "snuff films" being made for profit became more widely known with the commercial film ''[[Snuff (film)|Snuff]]'' (1976).&lt;ref name="csicop.org"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/snuff_film_the_making_of_an_urban_legend/ |author=Stine, Scott Aaron |title=The Snuff Film: The Making of an Urban Legend |work=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=23.3 |date=1999 |accessdate=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2p7i4oL6Dk |title=Do snuff movies exist? |series=Documentary, part 1 |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cook, David A. |title=Lost Illusions: American Cinema in The Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam |page=233 |publisher=University of California Press |date=2000 |isbn= 0-520-23265-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This low-budget [[exploitation film|exploitation]] horror film, originally titled ''Slaughter'', was directed by [[Michael and Roberta Findlay]]. In an interview decades later, Roberta Findlay said the film's distributor Allan Shackleton had read about snuff films being imported from [[South America]] and retitled ''Slaughter'' to ''Snuff'', to exploit the idea;&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypress.com/article-11831-the-curse-of-her-filmography.html |title=The Curse of Her Filmography: Roberta Findlay's grindhouse legacy |work=New York Press |date=July 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also added a new ending that depicted an actress being murdered on a film set.&lt;ref name="Lees"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.martinalees.co.uk/?p=43 |author=Lees, Martina |title=Death robe of secrecy hangs around snuff films |work=Beeld |date=October 18, 2003 |accessdate=December 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303094140/http://www.martinalees.co.uk/?p=43 |archivedate=March 3, 2012 |df=mdy-all }} (originally in [[Afrikaans]])&lt;/ref&gt; The promotion of ''Snuff'' on its second release suggested it featured the murder of an actress: "The film that could only be made in South America... where life is CHEAP",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hawkins, Joan |title=Cutting Edge: Art-Horror and The Horrific Avant-Garde |page=136 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |date=2000 |isbn=0-8166-3413-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but that was false advertising.&lt;ref name="Lees" /&gt; Shackleton put out false newspaper clippings that reported a citizens group's crusading against the film&lt;ref name="csicop.org" /&gt; and hired people to act as protesters to picket screenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/23189619/Snuff |title=Snuff |website=Britannica Online Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==False snuff films==

===The ''Guinea Pig'' films===
{{Main article|Guinea Pig (film series)}}
The first two films in the Japanese ''Guinea Pig'' series are designed to look like snuff films; the video is grainy and unsteady, as if recorded by amateurs. The sixth film in the series, ''Mermaid in a Manhole'', allegedly served as an inspiration for Japanese serial killer [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]], who murdered several preschool girls in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1991, actor [[Charlie Sheen]] became convinced that ''[[Flower of Flesh and Blood]]'' (1985), the second film in the series, depicted an actual homicide and contacted the [[FBI]].&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;  The Bureau initiated an investigation but closed it after the series'  producers released a "making of" film demonstrating the special effects used to simulate the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=McDowell, R. |title=Movies to Die For|work= The San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 7, 1994|page= A5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian director [[Ruggero Deodato]] was charged after rumors that the depictions of the killing of the main actors in his film ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' (1980) were real. He was able to clear himself of the charges after the actors made an appearance in court.&lt;ref name="In the Jungle"&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Ruggero Deodato (interviewee) |date=2003 | title=In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | medium=Documentary | location=Italy | publisher=Alan Young Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than graphic gore, the film contains several scenes of sexual violence and the genuine deaths of six animals onscreen and one off screen, issues which find ''Cannibal Holocaust'' in the midst of controversy to this day. It has also been claimed that ''Cannibal Holocaust'' is banned in over 50 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Cannibal Holocaust 25th Anniversary Edition |orig-year=1980 |others=[[Ruggero Deodato]] |page=back cover |publisher=[[VIPCO (Video Instant Picture Company)]] |location=UK |id=VIP666SE |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this has never been verified. In 2006, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine named ''Cannibal Holocaust'' as the 20th most controversial film of all-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1202224.html | title=The 25 Most Controversial Films of All-Time | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | accessdate=September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''soul''', in many religious, philosophical, and mythological traditions, is the [[incorporeality|incorporeal]] essence of a living being.&lt;ref&gt;"soul."Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 CD. 13 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Soul or psyche ([[Ancient Greek]]: ψυχή ''psūkhḗ'', of ψύχειν ''psū́khein'', "to breathe") are the mental abilities of a living being: reason, character, feeling, consciousness, memory, perception, thinking, etc. Depending on the philosophical system, a soul can either be mortal or [[immortality of the soul|immortal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soul (noun) - Oxford English Dictional (online full edition)|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/185083|website=Oxford English Dictionary (OED)|publisher=Oxford English Dictional (OED)|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Judeo-Christianity]], only human beings have immortal souls (although immortality is disputed within Judaism and may have been influenced by Plato).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8092-immortality-of-the-soul|title=IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-12-14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220130344/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8092-immortality-of-the-soul|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Catholic theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] attributed "soul" (''[[wikt:anima|anima]]'') to all organisms but argued that only human souls are immortal.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Eardley and Carl Still, ''Aquinas: A Guide for the Perplexed'' (London: Continuum, 2010), pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

Other religions (most notably [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]]) hold that all living things from the smallest bacterium to the largest of mammals are the souls themselves ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]], [[jiva]]) and have their physical representative (the body) in the world. [[Jainism|Jain philosophy]] is the oldest world philosophy that separates body ([[matter]]) from the [[soul]] (consciousness) completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya – Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual self is the soul, while the body is only a mechanism to experience the karma of that life i.e if we see a tiger then there is a self conscious identity residing in it (the soul), and a physical representative (the whole body of tiger which is observable) in the world. Some teach that even non-biological entities (such as rivers and mountains) possess souls. This belief is called [[animism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080709052029/http://www.bartleby.com/65/so/soul.html "Soul"], ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition. 2001–07. Retrieved 12 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek philosophers, such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], understood that the soul (ψυχή ''[[wikt:ψυχή#Ancient Greek|psūchê]]'') must have a logical faculty, the exercise of which was the most divine of human actions. At his defense trial, Socrates even summarized his teaching as nothing other than an exhortation for his fellow Athenians to excel in matters of the psyche since all bodily goods are dependent on such excellence (''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' 30a–b).

The current [[scientific consensus|consensus of modern science]] is that there is no evidence to support the existence of the soul when traditionally defined as the spiritual breath of the body. In [[metaphysics]], the concept of "Soul" may be equated with that of "[[Mind]]" in order to refer to the [[consciousness]] and [[intellect]] of the individual.

==Etymology==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The Modern English word "[[:wikt:soul|soul]]", derived from [[Old English]] ''sáwol, sáwel'', was first attested in the 8th&amp;nbsp;century poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' v. 2820 and in the [[Vespasian Psalter]] 77.50&amp;nbsp;. It is cognate with other German and [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] terms for the same idea, including [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''saiwala'', [[Old High German]] ''sêula, sêla'', [[Old Saxon]] ''sêola'', [[Old Dutch|Old Low Franconian]] ''sêla, sîla'', [[Old Norse]] ''sála'' and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''siela''. Deeper etymology of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word is unclear.

The original concept behind the Germanic root is thought to mean “''coming from or belonging to the sea'' (or ''lake'')”, because of the Germanic and pre-Celtic belief in souls emerging from and returning to [[Holy well|sacred lakes]], [[Old Saxon]] ''sêola'' (soul) compared to [[Old Saxon]] ''sêo'' (sea).

==Synonyms==
{{See also|Spirit}}
The [[Koine Greek]] [[Septuagint]] uses {{lang|grc|ψυχή}} (''psyche'') to translate [[biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] {{lang|he|נפש}} (''[[nephesh]]''), meaning "life, vital breath", and specifically refers to a mortal, physical life, but in English it is variously translated as "soul, self, life, creature, person, appetite, [[mind]], living being, desire, emotion, passion";{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} an example can be found in {{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:21}}:
: Hebrew – {{lang|he |וַיִּבְרָא אֱלֹהִים, אֶת-הַתַּנִּינִם הַגְּדֹלִים; וְאֵת כָּל-נֶפֶשׁ הַחַיָּה הָרֹמֶשֶׂת}}{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
: Septuagint – {{lang|grc|καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς τὰ κήτη τὰ μεγάλα καὶ πᾶσαν ψυχὴν ζῴων ἑρπετῶν.}}
: [[Vulgate]] – ''{{lang|la|Creavitque Deus cete grandia, et omnem animam viventem atque motabilem.}}
: [[Authorized King James Version]] – "And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth."

The Koine Greek word {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ψυχή|ψυχή]]}} (''[[psyche (psychology)|psychē]]''), "life, spirit, consciousness", is derived from a verb meaning "to cool, to blow", and hence refers to the breath, as opposed to {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σῶμα|σῶμα]]}} (''soma''), meaning "body".{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} ''Psychē'' occurs juxtaposed to {{lang|grc|σῶμα}}, as seen in {{Bibleverse|Matthew|10:28}}:
: Greek – {{lang|grc|καὶ μὴ φοβεῖσθε ἀπὸ τῶν ἀποκτεννόντων τὸ σῶμα, τὴν δὲ ψυχὴν μὴ δυναμένων ἀποκτεῖναι· φοβεῖσθε δὲ μᾶλλον τὸν δυνάμενον καὶ ψυχὴν καὶ σῶμα ἀπολέσαι ἐν γεέννῃ.}}
: Vulgate – ''{{lang|la|et nolite timere eos qui occidunt corpus animam autem non possunt occidere sed potius eum timete qui potest et animam et corpus perdere in gehennam.}}''
: Authorized King James Version (KJV) – "And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."

[[Paul the Apostle]] used ψυχή (''psychē'') and {{lang|grc|[[pneuma|πνεῦμα]]}} (''pneuma'') specifically to distinguish between the Jewish notions of {{lang|he|נפש}} (''nephesh'') and {{lang|he|רוח}} ''[[ruach|ruah]]'' (spirit){{citation needed|date=October 2017}} (also in the Septuagint, e.g. {{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:2}} {{lang|he|רוּחַ אֱלֹהִים}} = {{lang|grc|πνεῦμα θεοῦ}} = ''{{lang|la|spiritus Dei}}'' = "the Spirit of God").

[[File:Souls of Pe and Nekhen towing at Ramses' Temple in Abydos c.jpg|thumb|left|The [[souls of Pe and Nekhen]] towing the royal bargue on a relief of [[Ramesses II]]'s temple in Abydos.]]
In the [[ancient Egyptian religion]], an individual was believed to be made up of various elements, some physical and some spiritual. Similar ideas are found in ancient Assyrian and Babylonian religion. [[Kuttamuwa]], an 8th-century BC royal official from [[Sam'al]], ordered an inscribed [[stele]] erected upon his death. The inscription requested that his mourners commemorate his life and his [[afterlife]] with feasts "for my soul that is in this stele". It is one of the earliest references to a soul as a separate entity from the body. The {{convert|800|lb|adj=on}} [[basalt]] stele is {{convert|3|ft|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|2|ft|abbr=on}} wide. It was uncovered in the third season of excavations by the Neubauer Expedition of the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Found: An Ancient Monument to the Soul |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/science/18soul.html?8dpc=&amp;_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |quote=In a mountainous kingdom in what is now southeastern Turkey, there lived in the eighth century B.C. a royal official, Kuttamuwa, who oversaw the completion of an inscribed stone monument, or stele, to be erected upon his death.

===Bahá'í===
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] affirms that "the soul is a sign of God, a heavenly gem whose reality the most learned of men hath failed to grasp, and whose mystery no mind, however acute, can ever hope to unravel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |year=1976 |title=Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-187-6 |pages=158–163 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-82.html#gr1 |accessdate=2016-02-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214835/http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-82.html#gr1 |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]] stated that the soul not only continues to live after the physical death of the human body, but is, in fact, immortal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |year=1976 |title=Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-187-6 |pages=155–158 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-81.html#gr1 |accessdate=2016-02-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104955/http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-81.html#gr1 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaven can be seen partly as the soul's state of nearness to God; and hell as a state of remoteness from God. Each state follows as a natural consequence of individual efforts, or the lack thereof, to develop spiritually.&lt;ref name="rob1"&gt;{{cite book |author= Taherzadeh, Adib |authorlink= Adib Taherzadeh |year= 1976 |title= The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 1 |publisher= George Ronald |location= Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-270-8 |url= http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha%27i/Others/ROB/V1/Contents.html |accessdate= 2016-02-23 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191017/http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha'i/Others/ROB/V1/Contents.html |archivedate= 3 March 2016 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'u'lláh taught that individuals have no existence prior to their life here on earth and the soul's evolution is always towards God and away from the material world.&lt;ref name="rob1"/&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[Buddhism]] teaches that all things are in a constant state of flux: all is changing, and no [[wikt:permanent|permanent]] state exists by itself.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sources of Indian Tradition'', vol. 1, ed. Theodore de Bary (NY: Columbia UP, 1958), p. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt; This applies to human beings as much as to anything else in the cosmos. Thus, a human being has no permanent self.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 55-57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sources of Indian Tradition'', vol. 1, ed. Theodore de Bary (NY: Columbia UP, 1958), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; According to this doctrine of ''anatta'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''anātman'') – "no-self" or "no soul" – the words "I" or "me" do not refer to any fixed thing. They are simply convenient terms that allow us to refer to an ever-changing entity.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''anatta'' doctrine is not a kind of [[materialism]]. Buddhism does not deny the existence of "immaterial" entities, and it (at least traditionally) distinguishes bodily states from mental states.&lt;ref&gt;''Sources of Indian Tradition'', vol. 1, ed. Theodore de Bary (NY: Columbia UP, 1958), p. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the conventional translation of ''anatta'' as "no-soul"&lt;ref&gt;for example, in Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 51-66&lt;/ref&gt; can be confusing. If the word "soul" simply refers to an incorporeal component in living things that can continue after death, then Buddhism does not deny the existence of the soul.&lt;ref name="Indian Tradition 1958 p. 94"&gt;''Sources of Indian Tradition'', vol. 1, ed. Theodore de Bary (NY: Columbia UP, 1958), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Buddhism denies the existence of a permanent entity that remains constant behind the changing corporeal and incorporeal components of a living being. Just as the body changes from moment to moment, so thoughts come and go, and there is no permanent state underlying the mind that experiences these thoughts, as in [[Cartesianism]]. Conscious mental states simply arise and perish with no "thinker" behind them.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; When the body dies, Buddhists believe the incorporeal mental processes continue and are reborn in a new body.&lt;ref name="Indian Tradition 1958 p. 94"/&gt; Because the mental processes are constantly changing, the being that is reborn is neither entirely different from, nor exactly the same as, the being that died.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; However, the new being is ''continuous'' with the being that died – in the same way that the "you" of this moment is continuous with the "you" of a moment before, despite the fact that you are constantly changing.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist teaching holds that a notion of a permanent, abiding self is a delusion that is one of the causes of human conflict on the emotional, social, and political levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Conze |first= Edward |authorlink= Edward Conze |title= A Short History of Buddhism |year=1993 |publisher= Oneworld |isbn=1-85168-066-7 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'' (NY: Grove, 1962), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; They add that an understanding of ''anatta'' provides an accurate description of the human condition, and that this understanding allows us to pacify our mundane [[desire (philosophy)|desire]]s.

Various schools of Buddhism have differing ideas about what continues after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MAG/45144_2.htm |title=六朝神滅不滅論與佛教輪迴主體之研究 |publisher=Ccbs.ntu.edu.tw |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313160542/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MAG/45144_2.htm |archivedate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yogacara]] school in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism said there are [[Store consciousness]] which continue to exist after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-AN/an162621.htm |title=佛教心理論之發達觀 |publisher=Ccbs.ntu.edu.tw |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313160549/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-AN/an162621.htm |archivedate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some schools, particularly [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the view is that there are three minds: ''very subtle mind'', which does not disintegrate in death; ''subtle mind'', which disintegrates in death and which is "dreaming mind" or "unconscious mind"; and ''gross mind'', which does not exist when one is ''sleeping''. Therefore, ''gross mind'' is less permanent than subtle mind, which does not exist in death. ''Very subtle mind'', however, does continue, and when it "catches on", or coincides with phenomena, again, a new ''subtle mind'' emerges, with its own personality/assumptions/habits, and ''that'' entity experiences [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] in the current continuum.

Plants were said to be non-sentient (無情),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bskk.com/viewthread.php?tid=96608 |title=植物、草木、山石是无情众生吗？有佛性吗？ |publisher=Bskk.com |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009012544/http://www.bskk.com/viewthread.php?tid=96608 |archivedate=9 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Buddhist monks are required to not cut or burn trees, because some sentient beings rely on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awker.com/hongshi/mag/82/82-10.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121031406/http://www.awker.com/hongshi/mag/82/82-10.htm|archivedate=2011-11-21 |title=從律典探索佛教對動物的態度（中） |publisher=Awker.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Mahayana monks said non-sentient beings such as plants and stones have [[Buddha-nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dharma.com.tw/x1chinese/d33sprob/P4-215.htm |title=無情眾生現今是不具有神識，但具有佛性！ |publisher=Dharma.com.tw |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230085532/http://www.dharma.com.tw/x1chinese/d33sprob/P4-215.htm |archivedate=30 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020918192322/http://www.buddhism.com.cn/fjwh/9904/05.htm 无情有佛性]&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain modern Buddhists, particularly in [[Western world|Western countries]], reject—or at least take an agnostic stance toward—the concept of rebirth or reincarnation. [[Stephen Batchelor (agnostic)|Stephen Batchelor]] discusses this in his book ''Buddhism Without Beliefs''. Others point to [[reincarnation research|research]] that has been conducted at the [[University of Virginia]] as proof that some people are reborn.&lt;ref&gt;[[B. Alan Wallace]], ''Contemplative Science.'' University of Columbia Press, 2007, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{See also|Soul in the Bible|Christian mortalism}}
[[File:SoulCarriedtoHeaven.jpg|thumb|Soul carried to Heaven by [[William Bouguereau]]]]
Most Christians understand the soul as an [[ontology|ontological]] reality distinct from, yet integrally connected with, the body. Its characteristics are described in moral, spiritual, and philosophical terms. [[Richard Swinburne]], a Christian [[philosophy of religion|philosopher of religion]] at Oxford University, wrote that "it is a frequent criticism of substance dualism that [[Mind-body dualism|dualists]] cannot say what souls are. Souls are immaterial subjects of mental properties. They have sensations and thoughts, desires and beliefs, and perform intentional actions. Souls are essential parts of human beings". According to a common [[Christian eschatology]], when people die, their souls will be [[particular judgment|judged by God]] and determined to go to [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] or to [[Hell in Christianity|Hell]]. Though all branches of Christianity – Catholics, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Church of the East]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]], and [[mainline Protestant]]s – teach that Jesus Christ plays a decisive role in the [[Christian salvation]] process, the specifics of that role and the part played by individual persons or [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] rituals and relationships, is a matter of wide diversity in official church teaching, theological speculation and popular practice. Some Christians believe that if one has not repented of one's sins and has not trusted in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, he/she will go to [[Christian views on Hell|Hell]] and suffer eternal [[damnation]] or eternal separation from God. Some hold a belief that babies (including the unborn) and those with cognitive or mental impairments who have died will be received into [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] on the basis of God's grace through the sacrifice of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Doctrine and Covenants|last=Smith|first=Joseph|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|year=1981|isbn=1592975038|location=Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America|pages=286|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Christians understand the soul as the life, and believe that the dead are sleeping ([[Christian conditionalism]]). This belief is traditionally accompanied by the belief that the unrighteous soul will cease to exist instead of suffering eternally ([[annihilationism]]). Believers will inherit [[eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] either in [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]], or in a [[Kingdom of God]] on earth, and enjoy eternal fellowship with God.

There are also beliefs in [[universal salvation]].

====Trichotomy of the soul====
[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], one of western Christianity's most influential early Christian thinkers, described the soul as "a special substance, endowed with reason, adapted to rule the body". Some Christians espouse a [[trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomic]] view of humans, which characterizes humans as consisting of a body (''soma''), soul (''psyche''), and spirit (''pneuma'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm |title=Soul |publisher=newadvent.org |date=1 July 1912 |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128201145/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm |archivedate=28 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of modern Bible scholars point out how spirit and soul are used interchangeably in many biblical passages, and so hold to dichotomy: the view that each of us is body and soul. Paul said that the "body wars against" the soul, "For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit" (Heb 4:12 NASB), and that "I buffet my body", to keep it under control.
Trichotomy was changed to dichotomy as tenet of Christian faith at the Council of Constantinople in 869 regarded as the 8th Ecumenical Council by Roman Catholics.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

====Origin of the soul====
The 'origin of the soul' has provided a vexing question in Christianity. The major theories put forward include [[creationism (soul)|soul creationism]], [[traducianism]], and [[pre-existence]]. According to creationism, each individual soul is created directly by God, either at the moment of conception or some later time. According to traducianism, the soul comes from the parents by natural generation. According to the preexistence theory, the soul exists before the moment of conception. There have been differing thoughts regarding whether human [[embryo]]s have souls from conception, or there is a point between conception and birth where the [[fetus]] [[ensoulment|acquires a soul]], [[consciousness]], and/or [[personhood]]. Stances in this question might more or less influence judgements on the [[Christianity and abortion|morality of abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/medical_ethics/me0116.htm |title="Do Embryos Have Souls?", Father Tadeusz Pacholczyk, PhD, Catholic Education Resource Center |publisher=Catholiceducation.org |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629203818/http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/medical_ethics/me0116.htm |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Matthew Syed |date=12 May 2008 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article3912708.ece |title=Embryos have souls?

Protestants generally believe in the soul's existence, but fall into two major camps about what this means in terms of an [[afterlife]]. Some, following [[Jean Calvin|Calvin]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Helm]], ''John Calvin's Ideas'' 2006 p129 "The Immortality of the Soul: As we saw when discussing Calvin's Christology, Calvin is a substance dualist."&lt;/ref&gt; believe in the [[immortality of the soul]] and conscious existence after death, while others, following [[Martin Luther|Luther]],&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, Glenn W. Most, Salvatore Settis ''The Classical Tradition'' 2010 p480 "On several occasions, Luther mentioned contemptuously that the Council Fathers had decreed the soul immortal."&lt;/ref&gt; believe in the [[mortality of the soul]] and unconscious "sleep" until the [[resurrection of the dead]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Marius ''Martin Luther: the Christian between God and death'' 1999 p429 "Luther, believing in soul sleep at death, held here that in the moment of resurrection... the righteous will rise to meet Christ in the air, the ungodly will remain on earth for judgment,..."&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[new religious movement]]s derived from Adventism—including [[Christadelphians]],&lt;ref&gt;''Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith''.

The [[Hindu philosophy|six orthodox schools of Hinduism]] believe that there is Ātman (self, essence) in every being, a major point of difference with [[Buddhism]], which does not believe that there is either soul or self.&lt;ref name=4sources&gt;KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, {{ISBN|978-8120806191}}, pages 246-249, from note 385 onwards; Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791422175}}, page 64; "Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of ātman is central to Brahmanical thought).

In [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], a ''jiva'' ({{lang-sa|जीव}}, {{IAST|jīva}}, alternative spelling ''jiwa''; {{lang-hi|जीव}}, {{IAST|jīv}}, alternative spelling ''jeev'') is a living being, or any entity imbued with a life force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Hall|title=Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SqzkqnETEVYC|year=2011|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3430-8|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, ''jiva'' is the immortal essence or soul of a living organism (human, animal, fish or plant etc.) which survives physical death.&lt;ref name=jajinixxii/&gt; The concept of ''Ajiva'' in Jainism means "not soul", and represents matter (including body), time, space, non-motion and motion.&lt;ref name=jajinixxii&gt;{{cite book|author=J Jaini|title=Outlines Of Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54A9AAAAIAAJ|year=1940|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=xxii–xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jainism, a ''Jiva'' is either ''samsari'' (mundane, caught in cycle of rebirths) or ''mukta'' (liberated).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qN82XwAACAAJ|title=Gommatsara Jiva-kanda|first1=Jagmandar-lāl|last1=Jaini|archive-url=https://archive.org/download/sacredbooksofthe029558mbp|archive-date=2006|year=1927|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-024-0852-2_100397|title=Buddhism and Jainism|last=|first=|date=2017|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789402408515|editor-last=Sarao|editor-first=K.

The concept of ''jiva'' in Jainism is similar to ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' in Hinduism. However, some Hindu traditions differentiate between the two concepts, with ''jiva'' considered as individual self, while atman as that which is universal unchanging self that is present in all living beings and everything else as the metaphysical [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name=varenne46&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Varenne|title=Yoga and the Hindu Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meUWxDDqzuAC&amp;pg=PA46|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0543-9|pages=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Myers|title=Brahman: A Comparative Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfvaAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-83565-0|pages=140–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kO8-980xGk8C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=hiranyagarba&amp;ei=gCnrSaGyLZLQMu3AmaQB ''The Philosophy of Person: Solidarity and Cultural Creativity'', Jozef Tichner and George McClean, 1994, p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is sometimes referred to as ''jiva-atman'' (a soul in a living body).&lt;ref name=varenne46/&gt;
According to [[Brahma Kumaris]], the soul is an eternal point of light.

===Islam===
{{Main|Rūḥ|Nafs}}
The [[Quran]], the holy book of [[Islam]], distinguishes between the immortal ''[[rūḥ]]'' (spirit or "soul") and the mortal ''[[nafs]]'' (psyche).&lt;ref name=Talib&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Deuraseh |first1 = Nurdeen |last2 = Abu Talib |first2 = Mansor |year = 2005 |title = Mental health in Islamic medical tradition |url = |journal = The International Medical Journal |volume = 4 |issue = 2 |pages = 76–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The immortal rūḥ "drives" the mortal nafs, which comprises temporal desires and perceptions necessary for living.&lt;ref name="Ahmad"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahmad |first=Sultan |title=Islam In Perspective |chapter=''Nafs:'' What Is it? |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxT_3zlWc-UC&amp;pg=PA180 |edition=revised |publisher=Author House |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4490-3993-6 |page=180 |via=Google Books |access-date=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the passages in the Quran that mention ''rûh'' occur in chapters 17 ("The Night Journey") and 39 ("The Throngs"):
{{quote|And they ask you, [O Muhammad], about the spirit [''rûh'']. Say, "The spirit is of the affair of my Lord. And mankind has not been given of knowledge except a little.|Quran 17:85}}

===Jainism===
{{Main|Jīva (Jainism)|Vitalism (Jainism)}}
{{Further|Jain philosophy|Jainism and non-creationism}}
In Jainism, every living being, from plant or bacterium to human, has a soul and the concept forms the very basis of Jainism. According to Jainism, there is no beginning or end to the existence of soul. It is eternal in nature and changes its form until it attains liberation.

The soul ''([[Jīva (Jainism)|Jīva]])'' is basically categorized in one of two ways based on its present state.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
# Liberated Souls – These are souls which have attained liberation (''[[moksha]]'') and never become part of the life cycle again.
# Non-Liberated Souls – The souls of any living being which are stuck in the life cycle of 4 forms; ''Manushya Gati'' (Human Being), ''Tiryanch Gati'' (Any other living being), ''Dev Gati'' (Heaven) and ''Narak Gati'' (Hell).

Until the time the soul is liberated from the ''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]'' (cycle of repeated birth and death), it gets attached to one of these bodies based on the [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] (actions) of the individual soul. Irrespective of which state the soul is in, it has got the same attributes and qualities. The difference between the liberated and non-liberated souls is that the qualities and attributes are manifested completely in case of ''[[siddha]]'' (liberated soul) as they have overcome all the karmic bondages whereas in case of non-liberated souls they are partially exhibited.

Concerning the Jain view of the soul, [[Virchand Gandhi]] said
{{quote|the soul lives its own life, not for the purpose of the body, but the body lives for the purpose of the soul. If we believe that the soul is to be controlled by the body then soul misses its power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forgotten Gandhi, Virchand Gandhi (1864-1901) - Advocate of Universal Brotherhood |url=http://www.all-famous-quotes.com/Virchand_Gandhi_quotes.html |publisher=All Famous Quotes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921112719/http://www.all-famous-quotes.com/Virchand_Gandhi_quotes.html |archivedate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Hebrew]] terms {{Hebrew|נפש}} ''[[nephesh|nefesh]]'' (literally "living being"), {{Hebrew|רוח}} ''[[ruach]]'' (literally "wind"), {{Hebrew|נשמה}} ''neshamah'' (literally "breath"), {{Hebrew|חיה}} ''chayah'' (literally "life") and {{Hebrew|יחידה}} ''yechidah'' (literally "singularity") are used to describe the soul or spirit.&lt;ref&gt;''Zohar'', ''Rayah Mehemna'', ''Terumah'' 158b.

In [[Judaism]] the soul was believed to be given by God to Adam as mentioned in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], {{quote|Then the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.|{{Bibleverse|Genesis|2:7|JPR}}}}

Judaism relates the quality of one's soul to one's performance of the commandments (''[[mitzvot]])'' and reaching higher levels of understanding, and thus closeness to God. A person with such closeness is called a ''[[tzadik]]''. Therefore, Judaism embraces the commemoration of the day of one's death, ''[[Yartzeit|nahala]]''/''Yahrtzeit'' and not the [[birthday]]&lt;ref&gt;The only person mentioned in the [[Torah]] celebrating birthday (party) is the wicked [[pharaoh]] of Egypt {{Bibleverse|Genesis|40:20-22|JPR}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as a festivity of remembrance, for only toward the end of life's struggles, tests and challenges could human souls be judged and credited for righteousness.&lt;ref name="rebchaim birthday"&gt;{{cite web|last=HaQoton|first=Reb Chaim|title=Happy Birthday|url=http://rchaimqoton.blogspot.de/2007/04/happy-birthday.html|publisher=Reb Chaim HaQoton|accessdate=11 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109001613/http://rchaimqoton.blogspot.de/2007/04/happy-birthday.html|archivedate=9 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aish birthday"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Jewish Birthdays|url=http://www.aish.com/jl/l/ms/47139952.html|work=Judaism 101|publisher=Aish.com|accessdate=11 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822100333/http://www.aish.com/jl/l/ms/47139952.html|archivedate=22 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism places great importance on the study of the souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13933-soul|title=SOUL - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=jewishencyclopedia.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308035611/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13933-soul|archivedate=8 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kabbalah]] and other mystic traditions go into greater detail into the nature of the soul. Kabbalah separates the soul into five elements, corresponding to the [[five worlds]]:

# [[Nephesh|Nefesh]], related to natural instinct.
# [[Ruach]], related to emotion and morality.
# Neshamah, related to intellect and the awareness of God.
# Chayah, considered a part of God, as it were.
# [[Yechidah]].  This aspect is essentially one with God.

Kabbalah also proposed a concept of reincarnation, the ''[[gilgul]]''. (See also ''[[nefesh habehamit]]'' the "animal soul".)

===Scientology===
The [[Scientology]] view is that a person does not have a soul, it is a soul. A person is immortal, and may be reincarnated if they wish. The Scientology term for the soul is "[[thetan]]", derived from the Greek word "theta", symbolizing thought. Scientology counselling (called [[auditing]]) addresses the soul to improve abilities, both worldly and spiritual.

===Shamanism===
According to Nadya Yuguseva, a shaman from the Altai, "A woman has 40 souls; men have just one".&lt;ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
[[Sikhism]] considers soul (''atma'') to be part of God ([[Waheguru]]). Various hymns are cited from the holy book [[Guru Granth Sahib]] (SGGS) that suggests this belief. "God is in the Soul and the Soul is in the God."&lt;ref&gt;SGGS, M 1, p 1153.&lt;/ref&gt; The same concept is repeated at various pages of the SGGS. For example: "The soul is divine; divine is the soul. Worship Him with love."&lt;ref&gt;SGGS, M 4, p 1325.&lt;/ref&gt; and "The soul is the Lord, and the Lord is the soul; contemplating the Shabad, the Lord is found."&lt;ref&gt;SGGS, M 1, p 1030.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''atma'' or soul according to Sikhism is an entity or "spiritual spark" or "light" in our body because of which the body can sustain life. On the departure of this entity from the body, the body becomes lifeless – No amount of manipulations to the body can make the person make any physical actions. The soul is the ‘driver’ in the body. It is the ''roohu'' or spirit or ''atma'', the presence of which makes the physical body alive.

Many religious and philosophical traditions support the view that the soul is the ethereal substance – a spirit; a non material spark – particular to a unique living being. Such traditions often consider the soul both immortal and innately aware of its immortal nature, as well as the true basis for sentience in each living being. The concept of the soul has strong links with notions of an afterlife, but opinions may vary wildly even within a given religion as to what happens to the soul after death. Many within these religions and philosophies see the soul as immaterial, while others consider it possibly material.

===Taoism===
According to Chinese traditions, every person has two types of soul called [[hun and po]] (魂 and 魄), which are respectively [[yin and yang|yang and yin]]. [[Taoism]] believes in ten souls, ''sanhunqipo'' ([[:zh:三魂七魄|三魂七魄]]) "three ''hun'' and seven ''po''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deathreference.com/Ce-Da/Chinese-Beliefs.html |title=Encyclopedia of Death and Dying (2008) |publisher=Deathreference.com |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105103959/http://www.deathreference.com/Ce-Da/Chinese-Beliefs.html |archivedate=5 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pò is linked to the dead body and the grave, whereas the hún is linked to the ancestral tablet. A living being that loses any of them is said to have mental illness or [[unconsciousness]], while a dead soul may [[reincarnate]] to a [[disability]], lower [[desire realm]]s, or may even be unable to reincarnate.

&lt;!-- {{Main|Salvation|Soul sleep}} No, [[Salvation]] and [[Soul sleep]] are not the "main articles" for "Life and death", as this former article section has been called. Any connections between these terms should be made explicit in the text. At the very least, [[Template:Seealso]] would be more appropriate than [[Template:Main]]. --&gt;
In theological reference to the soul, the terms "life" and "death" are viewed as emphatically more definitive than the common concepts of "[[life|biological life]]" and "biological death". Because the soul is said to be transcendent of the ''[[matter|material]] existence,'' and is said to have (potentially) [[immortality|eternal life]], the death of the soul is likewise said to be an ''eternal death''. Thus, in the concept of [[divine judgment]], God is commonly said to have options with regard to the dispensation of souls, ranging from [[Heaven]] (i.e., [[angel]]s) to [[hell]] (i.e., [[demon]]s), with various concepts in between. Typically both Heaven and hell are said to be eternal, or at least far beyond a typical human concept of [[life expectancy|lifespan]] and time.

===Spirituality, New Age, and new religions===

====Brahma Kumaris====
In [[Brahma Kumaris]], human souls are believed to be incorporeal and [[eternity|eternal]]. God is considered to be the Supreme Soul, with maximum degrees of spiritual qualities, such as peace, love and purity.&lt;ref name="Ramsay_Possession"&gt;{{cite journal

====Theosophy====
In [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the soul is the field of our psychological activity (thinking, emotions, memory, desires, will, and so on) as well as of the so-called paranormal or [[psychic]] phenomena (extrasensory perception, out-of-body experiences, etc.). However, the soul is not the highest, but a middle dimension of human beings. Higher than the soul is the spirit, which is considered to be the real self; the source of everything we call "good"—happiness, wisdom, love, compassion, harmony, peace, etc. While the spirit is eternal and incorruptible, the soul is not. The soul acts as a link between the material body and the spiritual self, and therefore shares some characteristics of both. The soul can be attracted either towards the spiritual or towards the material realm, being thus the "battlefield" of good and evil. It is only when the soul is attracted towards the spiritual and merges with the Self that it becomes eternal and divine.

====Anthroposophy====
[[Rudolf Steiner]] differentiated three stages of soul development, which interpenetrate one another in consciousness:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Creeger|first=Rudolf Steiner; translated by Catherine E.|title=Theosophy: an introduction to the spiritual processes in human life and in the cosmos|year=1994|publisher=Anthroposophic Press|location=Hudson, NY|isbn=0-88010-373-6|pages=42–46|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The "sentient soul", centering on sensations, drives, and passions, with strong [[conation|conative]] (will) and emotional components;
*The "intellectual" or "mind soul", internalizing and reflecting on outer experience, with strong affective (feeling) and cognitive (thinking) components; and
*The "consciousness soul", in search of universal, objective truths.

====Miscellaneous====
In [[Surat Shabd Yoga|Surat Shabda Yoga]], the soul is considered to be an exact replica and spark of the Divine. The purpose of Surat Shabd Yoga is to realize one's True Self as soul (Self-Realisation), True Essence (Spirit-Realisation) and True Divinity (God-Realisation) while living in the physical body.

Similarly, the spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] held that "Atma, or the soul, is in reality identical with Paramatma the Oversoul — which is one, infinite, and eternal...[and] [t]he sole purpose of creation is for the soul to enjoy the infinite state of the Oversoul consciously."&lt;ref&gt;Baba, Meher.

==Philosophical views==
The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] used the word "[[Ensoulment|ensouled]]" to represent the concept of being "alive", indicating that the earliest surviving [[western philosophy|western philosophical]] view believed that the soul was that which gave the body life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2009/entries/ancient-soul/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Lorenz|first=Hendrik|date=2009|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soul was considered the incorporeal or spiritual "breath" that animates (from the Latin, ''[[:wikt:anima|anima]]'', cf. "animal") the living organism.

[[F. M. Cornford|Francis M. Cornford]] quotes [[Pindar]] by saying that the soul sleeps while the limbs are active, but when one is sleeping, the soul is active and reveals "an award of joy or sorrow drawing near" in dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Francis M. Cornford, ''Greek Religious Thought'', p.64, referring to Pindar, Fragment 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erwin Rohde]] writes that an early pre-[[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] belief presented the soul as lifeless when it departed the body, and that it retired into [[Hades]] with no hope of returning to a body.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Rohde, ''Psyche'', 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socrates and Plato&lt;!--Linked from 'Emanationism'--&gt;===
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Plato]] (left) and [[Aristotle]] (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]'', a [[fresco]] by [[Raphael]].]]
{{Main|Plato's tripartite theory of soul}}
Drawing on the words of his teacher Socrates, Plato considered the psyche to be the [[essence]] of a person, being that which decides how we behave. He considered this essence to be an incorporeal, eternal occupant of our being. Plato says that even after death, the soul exists and is able to think. He believed that as bodies die, the soul is continually reborn in subsequent bodies. However, Aristotle believed that only one part of the soul was immortal namely the intellect (''[[Logos#Ancient Greek philosophy|logos]]''). The Platonic soul consists of three parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Gift of Logos: Essays in Continental Philosophy|last = Jones|first = David|publisher = Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = 33–35|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1RgaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=plato+soul+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjL-or46rPJAhVU_mMKHUQ-C48Q6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=plato%20soul%20logos&amp;f=false|accessdate = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# the ''logos'', or ''logistikon'' (mind, [[nous]], or [[reason]])
# the ''[[Thumos|thymos]]'', or ''thumetikon'' ([[emotion]], spiritedness, or masculine)
# the ''[[Eros (concept)|eros]]'', or ''epithumetikon'' (appetitive, [[motivation|desire]], or feminine)

The parts are located in different regions of the body:
# ''logos'' is located in the head, is related to reason and regulates the other part.
# ''thymos'' is located near the chest region and is related to anger.
# ''eros'' is located in the stomach and is related to one's desires.

Plato also compares the three parts of the soul or psyche to a societal [[Plato's tripartite theory of soul|caste system]]. According to Plato's theory, the three-part soul is essentially the same thing as a state's class system because, to function well, each part must contribute so that the whole functions well. Logos keeps the other functions of the soul regulated.

===Aristotle===
[[File:Aristotelian Soul.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The structure of the souls of plants, animals, and humans, according to [[Aristotle]], with ''Bios'', ''Zoê'', and ''Psūchê'']]
Aristotle (384 BCE – 322 BCE) defined the soul, or ''Psūchê'' (ψυχή), as the "[[first actuality]]" of a naturally organized body,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|title=On The Soul|pages=412b5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued against its separate existence from the physical body. In Aristotle's view, the primary activity, or full actualization, of a living thing constitutes its soul. For example, the full actualization of an eye, as an independent organism, is to see (its purpose or [[final cause]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aristotle |title=Physics |at=Book VIII, Chapter 5, pages 256a5-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is that the full actualization of a human being would be living a fully functional human life in accordance with reason (which he considered to be a faculty unique to humanity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aristotle |title=Nicomachean Ethics |at=Book I, Chapter 7, pages 1098a7-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Aristotle, the soul is the organization of the form and matter of a natural being which allows it to strive for its full actualization. This organization between form and matter is necessary for any activity, or functionality, to be possible in a natural being. Using an artifact (non-natural being) as an example, a house is a building for human habituation, but for a house to be actualized requires the material (wood, nails, bricks, etc.) necessary for its actuality (i.e. being a fully functional house). However, this does not imply that a house has a soul. In regards to artifacts, the source of motion that is required for their full actualization is outside of themselves (for example, a builder builds a house). In natural beings, this source of motion is contained within the being itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aristotle |title=Physics |at=Book III, Chapter 1, pages 201a10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle elaborates on this point when he addresses the faculties of the soul.

The various [[faculties of the soul]], such as nutrition, movement (peculiar to animals), reason (peculiar to humans), sensation (special, common, and incidental) and so forth, when exercised, constitute the "second" actuality, or fulfillment, of the capacity to be alive. For example, someone who falls asleep, as opposed to someone who falls dead, can wake up and live their life, while the latter can no longer do so.

Aristotle identified three hierarchical levels of natural beings: plants, animals, and people, having three different degrees of soul: ''Bios'' (life), ''Zoë'' (animate life), and ''Psuchë'' (self-conscious life). For these groups, he identified three corresponding levels of soul, or biological activity: the nutritive activity of growth, sustenance and reproduction which all life shares (''Bios''); the self-willed motive activity and sensory faculties, which only animals and people have in common (''Zoë''); and finally "reason", of which people alone are capable (''Pseuchë'').

Aristotle's discussion of the soul is in his work, ''De Anima'' (''[[On the Soul]]''). Although mostly seen as opposing Plato in regard to the immortality of the soul, a controversy can be found in relation to the fifth chapter of the third book: In this text both interpretations can be argued for, soul as a whole can be deemed mortal, and a part called "active intellect" or "active mind" is immortal and eternal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aristotle |title=On The Soul |at=Book III, Chapter 5, pages 430a24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates exist for both sides of the controversy, but it has been understood that there will be permanent disagreement about its final conclusions, as no other [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] text contains this specific point, and this part of ''De Anima'' is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-psychology/active-mind.html |title=Aristotle's Psychology |chapter=supplement: The Active Mind of De Anima iii 5) |accessdate=2013-12-12 |author=Shields, Christopher |year=2011 |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Aristotle states that the soul helps humans find the truth and understanding the true purpose or role of the soul is extremely difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{dite book |title=Introduction to Aristotle |last=Smith |first=J. S. (Trans) |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1973 |location=Chicago |pages=155–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avicenna and Ibn al-Nafis===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
Following Aristotle, [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) and [[Ibn al-Nafis]], a [[list of Persian philosophers|Persian philosopher]], further elaborated upon the Aristotelian understanding of the soul and developed their own theories on the soul. They both made a distinction between the soul and the spirit, and the [[Avicennism|Avicennian]] doctrine on the nature of the soul was influential among the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]. Some of Avicenna's views on the soul include the idea that the immortality of the soul is a consequence of its nature, and not a purpose for it to fulfill. In his theory of "The Ten Intellects", he viewed the human soul as the tenth and final [[intelligence|intellect]].

While he was imprisoned, Avicenna wrote his famous "Floating Man" [[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantial nature of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Floating_Man|title=Floating Man - The Art and Popular Culture Encyclopedia|website=www.artandpopularculture.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426075928/http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Floating_Man|archivedate=26 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told his readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air, isolated from all sensations, which includes no [[sense|sensory]] contact with even their own bodies. He argues that in this scenario one would still have [[self-consciousness]]. He thus concludes that the idea of the [[self (philosophy)|self]] is not logically dependent on any physical [[object (philosophy)|thing]], and that the soul should not be seen in [[relative term]]s, but as a primary given, a [[substance theory|substance]]. This argument was later refined and simplified by [[René Descartes]] in [[epistemology|epistemic]] terms, when he stated: "I can abstract from the supposition of all external things, but not from the supposition of my own consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 315, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-13159-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avicenna generally supported Aristotle's idea of the soul originating from the [[heart]], whereas Ibn al-Nafis rejected this idea and instead argued that the soul "is related to the entirety and not to one or a few [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s". He further criticized Aristotle's idea whereby every unique soul requires the existence of a unique source, in this case the heart. al-Nafis concluded that "the soul is related primarily neither to the spirit nor to any organ, but rather to the entire matter whose temperament is prepared to receive that soul," and he defined the soul as nothing other than "what a human indicates by saying "[[I (pronoun)|I]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nahyan A.

Fancy|year=2006|title=Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafīs (d. 1288)"|pages=209–210|work=Electronic Theses and Dissertations'', [[University of Notre Dame]]|url=http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404020329/http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615/|archivedate=4 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Aquinas===
Following Aristotle (whom he referred to as "the Philosopher") and Avicenna, [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–74) understood the soul to be the first actuality of the living body. Consequent to this, he distinguished three orders of life: plants, which feed and grow; animals, which add sensation to the operations of plants; and humans, which add intellect to the operations of animals.

Concerning the human soul, his epistemological theory required that, since the knower becomes what he knows, the soul is definitely not corporeal—if it is corporeal when it knows what some corporeal thing is, that thing would come to be within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Quaestiones Disputatae de Veritate|url=http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/qdv02.html#51826|language=latin|accessdate=2016-02-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023626/http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/qdv02.html#51826|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the soul has an operation which does not rely on a body organ, and therefore the soul can exist without a body. Furthermore, since the rational soul of human beings is a subsistent form and not something made of matter and form, it cannot be destroyed in any natural process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Super Boetium De Trinitate|url=http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/cbt.html#84681|language=latin|accessdate=2016-02-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110654/http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/cbt.html#84681|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full argument for the [[immortality of the soul]] and Aquinas' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the [[Summa Theologica]].

===Immanuel Kant===
In his discussions of rational psychology, [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) identified the soul as the "I" in the strictest sense, and argued that the existence of inner experience can neither be proved nor disproved.
{{quote|We cannot prove a priori the immateriality of the soul, but rather only so much: that all properties and actions of the soul cannot be recognized from materiality.}} It is from the "I", or soul, that Kant proposes transcendental rationalization, but cautions that such rationalization can only determine the limits of knowledge if it is to remain practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Philosophy of mind===
{{Main|Philosophy of mind}}
[[Gilbert Ryle]]'s [[ghost in the machine]] argument, which is a rejection of Descartes' [[mind–body dualism]], can provide a contemporary understanding of the soul/mind, and the problem concerning its connection to the brain/body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryles|first=Gilbert|title=The Concept of Mind|year=1949|publisher=University Of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Hillman===
Psychologist James Hillman's [[archetypal psychology]] is an attempt to restore the concept of the soul, which Hillman viewed as the "self-sustaining and imagining substrate" upon which consciousness rests. Hillman described the soul as that "which makes meaning possible, [deepens] events into experiences, is communicated in love, and has a religious concern", as well as "a special relation with death".&lt;ref name="Blue Fire 5"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hillman J (T Moore, Ed.) |title=A blue fire: Selected writings by James Hillman |publisher=HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY, USA |year=1989 |page=21 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Departing from the Cartesian [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] "between outer tangible reality and inner states of mind", Hillman takes the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] stance&lt;ref name="Blue Fire 7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hillman J (T Moore, Ed.) |title=A blue fire: Selected writings by James Hillman |publisher=HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY, USA |year=1989 |page=112 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there is a "third, middle position" in which soul resides.&lt;ref name="Blue Fire 6"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hillman J (T Moore, Ed.) |title=A blue fire: Selected writings by James Hillman |publisher=HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY, USA |year=1989 |page=121 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archetypal psychology acknowledges this third position by attuning to, and often accepting, the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], [[dream]]s, [[mythology|myths]], and even [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]] through which, in Hillman's view, soul expresses itself.

==Science==
The current [[scientific consensus]] across all fields is that the existence of any kind of soul in the traditional sense is incompatible with a modern scientific understanding of the human mind, which holds that the human being is merely a complex machine that operates based on the exact same physical laws as all other objects in the universe, according to Julien Musolino, a cognitive scientist and professor at [[Rutgers University]],&lt;ref name="Musolino2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Musolino|first=Julien|date=2015|title=The Soul Fallacy: What Science Shows We Gain from Letting Go of Our Soul Beliefs|location=Amherst, New York|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-61614-962-8|pages=21–38|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; who states that there is currently no scientific evidence whatsoever to support the existence of the soul&lt;ref name="Musolino2015"/&gt; and there is considerable evidence that seems to indicate that souls do not exist.&lt;ref name="Musolino2015"/&gt;

===Neuroscience===
[[Neuroscience]] as an [[interdisciplinary]] field, and its branch of [[cognitive neuroscience]] particularly, operates under the [[ontology|ontological]] assumption of [[physicalism]]. In other words, it assumes—in order to perform its science—that only the fundamental phenomena studied by [[physics]] exist. Thus, neuroscience seeks to understand mental phenomena within the framework according to which human [[thought]] and [[behavior]] are caused solely by physical processes taking place inside the brain, and it operates by the way of [[reductionism]] by seeking an explanation for the mind in terms of brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;O. Carter Snead.

To study the mind in terms of the brain several methods of [[functional neuroimaging]] are used to study the neuroanatomical correlates of various [[cognition|cognitive processes]] that constitute the mind. The evidence from brain imaging indicates that all processes of the mind have physical correlates in brain function.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Eugenio Cavanna, Andrea Nani, Hal Blumenfeld, Steven Laureys. "[https://books.google.com/books/about/Neuroimaging_of_Consciousness.html?id=YQZomQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Neuroimaging of Consciousness]" (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; However, such correlational studies cannot determine whether neural activity plays a causal role in the occurrence of these cognitive processes ([[correlation does not imply causation]]) and they cannot determine if the neural activity is either [[necessity and sufficiency|necessary or sufficient]] for such processes to occur. Identification of [[causality|causation]], and of necessary and sufficient conditions requires explicit experimental manipulation of that activity. If manipulation of brain activity changes consciousness, then a causal role for that brain activity can be inferred.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farah|first=Martha J.|author2=Murphy, Nancey|title=Neuroscience and the Soul|journal=Science|date=February 2009|volume=323|issue=5918|page=1168|doi=10.1126/science.323.5918.1168a|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5918/1168.1.full|accessdate=20 November 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426214509/http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5918/1168.1.full|archivedate=26 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Velmans, Susan Schneider.

===Physics===
Physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]] has written that the idea of a soul is incompatible with [[quantum field theory]] (QFT). He writes that for a soul to exist: "Not only is new physics required, but dramatically new physics. Within QFT, there can't be a new collection of 'spirit particles' and 'spirit forces' that interact with our regular atoms, because we would have detected them in existing experiments."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sean M. Carroll|Carroll, Sean M.]]. (2011). [http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/05/23/physics-and-the-immortality-of-the-soul/ "Physics and the Immortality of the Soul"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006180135/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/05/23/physics-and-the-immortality-of-the-soul/ |date=6 October 2011 }}. ''[[Scientific American]]''. Retrieved 2014-10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quantum indeterminacy|Quantum indeterminism]] has been invoked by some theorists as a solution to the problem of how a soul might interact with the brain, but neuroscientist Peter Clarke found errors with this viewpoint, noting there is no evidence that such processes play a role in brain function; and concluded that a [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] soul has no basis from quantum physics.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Peter. (2014). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24355546 ''Neuroscience, Quantum Indeterminism and the Cartesian Soul''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910221027/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24355546 |date=10 September 2017 }}. Brain and cognition 84: 109-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parapsychology==
Some [[parapsychologists]] have attempted to establish, by [[scientific]] experiment, whether a soul separate from the brain exists, as is more commonly defined in religion rather than as a synonym of psyche or mind. [[Milbourne Christopher]] (1979) and [[Mary Roach]] (2010) have argued that none of the attempts by parapsychologists have yet succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher]]. (1979).

===Weight of the soul===
In 1901 [[Duncan MacDougall (doctor)|Duncan MacDougall]] conducted [[21 grams experiment|an experiment]] in which he made weight measurements of patients as they died. He claimed that there was weight loss of varying amounts at the time of death; he concluded the soul weighed 21 grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = MacDougall |first1 = Duncan |authorlink = Duncan MacDougall (doctor) |year = 1907 |title = The Soul: Hypothesis Concerning Soul Substance Together with Experimental Evidence of the Existence of Such Substance |url = |journal = American Medicine.

Park]] has written that MacDougall's experiments "are not regarded today as having any scientific merit" and the psychologist [[Bruce Hood (psychologist)|Bruce Hood]] wrote that "because the weight loss was not reliable or replicable, his findings were unscientific."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Park|Park, Robert L]]. (2009). ''Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science''.

[[Image:Sphere wireframe 10deg 6r.svg|right|thumb|A two-dimensional [[3D projection#Perspective projection|perspective projection]] of a sphere]]
A '''sphere''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:σφαῖρα|σφαῖρα]] — ''sphaira'', "globe, ball"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfai%3Dra^ σφαῖρα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) is a perfectly round [[Geometry|geometrical]] object in [[solid geometry|three-dimensional space]] that is the surface of a completely round [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] (viz., analogous to the circular objects in two dimensions, where a "[[circle]]" circumscribes its [[Disk (mathematics)|"disk"]]).

Like a circle in a two-dimensional space, a sphere is defined mathematically as the [[Locus (mathematics)|set of points]] that are all at the same distance {{math|''r''}} from a given point, but in a three-dimensional space.&lt;ref name=Albert54&gt;{{harvnb|Albert|2016|loc=p. 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distance {{math|''r''}} is the [[radius]] of the ball, which is made up from all points with a distance less than {{math|''r''}} from the given point, which is the [[centre (geometry)|center]] of the mathematical ball. These are also referred to as the radius and center of the sphere, respectively. The longest straight line through the ball, connecting two points of the sphere, passes through the center and its length is thus twice the radius; it is a [[diameter]] of both the sphere and its ball.

While outside mathematics the terms "sphere" and "ball" are sometimes used interchangeably, in [[mathematics]] the above distinction is made between a ''sphere'', which is a two-dimensional [[closed surface]], [[embedding|embedded]] in a three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], and a ''ball'', which is a three-dimensional shape that includes the sphere and everything ''inside'' the sphere (a ''closed ball''), or, more often, just the points ''inside'', but ''not on'' the sphere (an ''open ball''). This distinction has not always been maintained and especially older mathematical references talk about a sphere as a solid. This is analogous to the situation in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], where the terms "circle" and "disk" can also be confounded.

==Equations in three-dimensional space==
[[Image:Sphere and Ball.png|right|thumb|two orthogonal radii of a sphere]]
{{see also|trigonometric function|spherical coordinates}}

In [[analytic geometry]], a sphere with center {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and radius {{mvar|r}} is the [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of all points {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} such that
:&lt;math&gt; (x - x_0 )^2 + (y - y_0 )^2 + ( z - z_0 )^2 = r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{mvar|a, b, c, d, e}} be real numbers with {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}} and put
:&lt;math&gt;x_0 = \frac{-b}{a}, \quad y_0 = \frac{-c}{a}, \quad z_0 = \frac{-d}{a}, \quad \rho = \frac{b^2 +c^2+d^2 - ae}{a^2}. &lt;/math&gt;
Then the equation
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z) = a(x^2 + y^2 +z^2) + 2(bx + cy + dz) + e = 0&lt;/math&gt;
has no real points as solutions if &lt;math&gt;\rho &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and is called the equation of an '''imaginary sphere'''. If &lt;math&gt;\rho = 0&lt;/math&gt; the only solution of &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z) = 0&lt;/math&gt; is the point &lt;math&gt;P_0 = (x_0,y_0,z_0)&lt;/math&gt; and the equation is said to be the equation of a '''point sphere'''. Finally, in the case &lt;math&gt;\rho &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z) = 0&lt;/math&gt; is an equation of a sphere whose center is &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; and whose radius is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt \rho&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Albert54 /&gt;

If {{mvar|a}} in the above equation is zero then {{math|1=''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = 0}} is the equation of a plane. Thus, a plane may be thought of as a sphere of infinite radius whose center is a [[point at infinity]].&lt;ref name=Woods266&gt;{{harvnb|Woods|1961|loc=p. 266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The points on the sphere with radius &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and center &lt;math&gt;(x_0,y_0,z_0)&lt;/math&gt; can be parameterized via
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} x &amp;= x_0 + r \sin \varphi \; \cos \theta \\
y &amp;= y_0 + r \sin \varphi \; \sin \theta \qquad (0 \leq \varphi \leq \pi,\;  0 \leq \theta &lt; 2\pi ) \\
z &amp;= z_0 + r \cos \varphi \,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kreyszig|1972|p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sphere of any radius centered at zero is an integral surface of the following [[differential form]]:
:&lt;math&gt; x \, dx + y \, dy + z \, dz = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation reflects that position and velocity vectors of a point, {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} and {{math|(''dx'', ''dy'', ''dz'')}}, traveling on the sphere are always [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] to each other.

A sphere can also be constructed as the surface formed by rotating a [[circle]] about any of its [[diameter]]s. Since a circle is a special type of [[ellipse]], a sphere is a special type of [[ellipsoid of revolution]]. Replacing the circle with an ellipse rotated about its [[major axis]], the shape becomes a prolate [[spheroid]]; rotated about the minor axis, an oblate spheroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albert|2016|loc=p. 60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enclosed volume{{anchor|Volume}} ==
[[File:Esfera Arquímedes0.svg|thumb|Sphere and circumscribed cylinder]]

In three dimensions, the [[volume]] inside a sphere (that is, the volume of a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]], but classically referred to as the volume of a sphere) is 
: &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|r}} is the radius of the sphere. [[Archimedes]] first derived this formula, by showing that the volume inside a sphere is twice the volume between the sphere and the [[circumscribe]]d [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of that sphere (having the height and diameter equal to the diameter of the sphere).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steinhaus|1969|loc=p. 223}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assertion can be obtained from [[Cavalieri's principle]]. This formula can also be derived using [[integral calculus]], i.e. [[disk integration]] to sum the volumes of an [[infinite number]] of [[Circle#Properties|circular]] disks of infinitesimally small thickness stacked side by side and centered along the {{mvar|x}}-axis from {{math|1=''x'' = −''r''}}  to {{math|1=''x'' = ''r''}}, assuming the sphere of radius {{mvar|r}} is centered at the origin. 

At any given {{mvar|x}}, the incremental volume ({{mvar|δV}}) equals the product of the cross-sectional [[area of a disk#Onion proof|area of the disk]] at {{mvar|x}} and its thickness ({{mvar|δx}}):
: &lt;math&gt;\delta V \approx \pi y^2 \cdot \delta x.&lt;/math&gt;

The total volume is the summation of all incremental volumes:
: &lt;math&gt;V \approx \sum \pi y^2 \cdot \delta x.&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit as {{mvar|δx}} approaches zero&lt;ref name="delta"/&gt; this equation becomes:
: &lt;math&gt;V = \int_{-r}^{r} \pi y^2 dx.&lt;/math&gt;

At any given {{mvar|x}}, a right-angled triangle connects {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}} and {{mvar|r}} to the origin; hence, applying the [[Pythagorean theorem]] yields:
: &lt;math&gt;y^2 = r^2 - x^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Using this substitution gives
: &lt;math&gt;V = \int_{-r}^{r} \pi (r^2 - x^2)dx,&lt;/math&gt;

that can be evaluated to give the result
: &lt;math&gt;V = \pi \left[r^2x - \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{-r}^{r} = \pi \left(r^3 - \frac{r^3}{3} \right) - \pi \left(-r^3 + \frac{r^3}{3} \right) = \frac43\pi r^3.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, this formula is found using [[spherical coordinates]], with volume element
: &lt;math&gt; dV=r^2\sin\theta\, dr\, d\theta\, d\varphi&lt;/math&gt;
so
: &lt;math&gt;V=\int_0^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{\pi} \int_0^r r'^2\sin\theta\, dr'\, d\theta\, d\varphi  
= 2\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \int_0^r r'^2\sin\theta\, dr'\, d\theta 
= 4\pi \int_0^r r'^2\, dr'\ 
=\frac43\pi r^3.&lt;/math&gt;
For most practical purposes, the volume inside a sphere [[Inscribed figure|inscribed]] in a cube can be approximated as 52.4% of the volume of the cube, since {{math|1=''V'' = {{sfrac|{{pi}}|6}} ''d''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{mvar|d}} is the diameter of the sphere and also the length of a side of the cube and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|6}}&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0.5236. For example, a sphere with diameter 1 meter has 52.4% the volume of a cube with edge length 1 meter, or about 0.524&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Surface area{{anchor|Area}}==
&lt;!-- [[Surface area of a sphere]] is a redirect that points to this section --&gt;

The [[surface area]] of a sphere of radius {{mvar|r}} is:
:&lt;math&gt;A = 4\pi r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Archimedes]] first derived this formula&lt;ref name=MathWorld_Sphere&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Sphere |id=Sphere}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the fact that the projection to the lateral surface of a [[circumscribe]]d cylinder is area-preserving.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steinhaus|1969|loc=p. 221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach to obtaining the formula comes from the fact that it equals the [[derivative]] of the formula for the volume with respect to {{mvar|r}} because the total volume inside a sphere of radius {{mvar|r}} can be thought of as the summation of the surface area of an infinite number of spherical shells of infinitesimal thickness concentrically stacked inside one another from radius 0 to radius {{mvar|r}}. At infinitesimal thickness the discrepancy between the inner and outer surface area of any given shell is infinitesimal, and the elemental volume at radius {{mvar|r}} is simply the product of the surface area at radius {{mvar|r}} and the infinitesimal thickness.

At any given radius {{mvar|r}},&lt;ref&gt;{{mvar|r}} is being considered as a variable in this computation&lt;/ref&gt; the incremental volume ({{mvar|δV}}) equals the product of the surface area at radius {{mvar|r}} ({{math|''A''(''r'')}}) and the thickness of a shell ({{mvar|δr}}):
:&lt;math&gt;\delta V \approx A(r) \cdot \delta r. &lt;/math&gt;

The total volume is the summation of all shell volumes:
:&lt;math&gt;V \approx \sum A(r) \cdot \delta r.&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit as {{mvar|δr}} approaches zero&lt;ref name="delta"&gt;Pages 141, 149. {{cite book
|author1=E. J. Borowski |author2=J. M. Borwein |title=Collins Dictionary of Mathematics
|isbn=0-00-434347-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; this equation becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;V = \int_0^r A(r) \, dr.&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute {{mvar|V}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac43\pi r^3 = \int_0^r A(r) \, dr.&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to {{mvar|r}} yields {{mvar|A}} as a function of {{mvar|r}}:
:&lt;math&gt;4\pi r^2 = A(r).&lt;/math&gt;

This is generally abbreviated as:
:&lt;math&gt;A = 4\pi r^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|r}} is now considered to be the fixed radius of the sphere.

Alternatively, the [[area element]] on the sphere is given in [[spherical coordinates]] by {{math|1=''dA'' = ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sin ''θ dθ dφ''}}. In [[Cartesian coordinates]], the area element is
: &lt;math&gt;dS=\frac{r}{\sqrt{r^{2}-{\displaystyle \sum_{i\ne k}x_{i}^{2}}}}\prod_{i\ne k}dx_{i},\;\forall k.&lt;/math&gt; 
For more generality, see [[Volume element|area element]].

The total area can thus be obtained by [[Integral|integration]]:
:&lt;math&gt;A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi r^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\varphi = 4\pi r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The sphere has the smallest surface area of all surfaces that enclose a given volume, and it encloses the largest volume among all closed surfaces with a given surface area. The sphere therefore appears in nature: for example, bubbles and small water drops are roughly spherical because the [[surface tension]] locally minimizes surface area.

The surface area relative to the mass of a ball is called the [[specific surface area]] and can be expressed from the above stated equations as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SSA} = \frac{A}{V\rho} = \frac{3}{r\rho},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|ρ}} is the [[density]] (the ratio of mass to volume).

==Geometric properties==
A sphere is uniquely determined by four points that are not [[coplanar]]. More generally, a sphere is uniquely determined by four conditions such as passing through a point, being tangent to a plane, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albert|2016|loc=p. 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property is analogous to the property that three [[collinear|non-collinear]] points determine a unique circle in a plane.

Consequently, a sphere is uniquely determined by (that is, passes through) a circle and a point not in the plane of that circle.

By examining the [[Circle of a sphere#Sphere-sphere intersection|common solutions of the equations of two spheres]], it can be seen that two spheres intersect in a circle and the plane containing that circle is called the '''radical plane''' of the intersecting spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albert|2016|loc=p. 57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the radical plane is a real plane, the circle may be imaginary (the spheres have no real point in common) or consist of a single point (the spheres are tangent at that point).&lt;ref name=Woods267&gt;{{harvnb|Woods|1961|loc=p. 267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The angle between two spheres at a real point of intersection is the [[dihedral angle]] determined by the tangent planes to the spheres at that point. Two spheres intersect at the same angle at all points of their circle of intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albert|2016|loc=p. 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; They intersect at right angles (are [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]]) if and only if the squares of the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of the squares of their radii.&lt;ref name=Woods266 /&gt;

===Pencil of spheres===
If {{math|1=''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = 0}} and {{math|1=''g''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = 0}} are the equations of two distinct spheres then 
:&lt;math&gt;s f(x,y,z) + t g(x,y,z) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
is also the equation of a sphere for arbitrary values of the parameters {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|t}}. The set of all spheres satisfying this equation is called a '''pencil of spheres''' determined by the original two spheres. In this definition a sphere is allowed to be a plane (infinite radius, center at infinity) and if both the original spheres are planes then all the spheres of the pencil are planes, otherwise there is only one plane (the radical plane) in the pencil.&lt;ref name=Woods266 /&gt;

If the pencil of spheres does not consist of all planes, then there are three types of pencils:&lt;ref name=Woods267 /&gt;
*If the spheres intersect in a real circle {{mvar|C}}, then the pencil consists of all the spheres containing {{mvar|C}}, including the radical plane. The centers of all the ordinary spheres in the pencil lie on a line passing through the center of {{mvar|C}} and perpendicular to the radical plane.
*If the spheres intersect in an imaginary circle, all the spheres of the pencil also pass through this imaginary circle but as ordinary spheres they are disjoint (have no real points in common). The line of centers is perpendicular to the radical plane, which is a real plane in the pencil containing the imaginary circle.
*If the spheres intersect in a point {{mvar|A}}, all the spheres in the pencil are tangent at {{mvar|A}} and the radical plane is the common tangent plane of all these spheres. The line of centers is perpendicular to the radical plane at {{mvar|A}}.

All the tangent lines from a fixed point of the radical plane to the spheres of a pencil have the same length.&lt;ref name=Woods267 /&gt;

The radical plane is the locus of the centers of all the spheres that are orthogonal to all the spheres in a pencil. Moreover, a sphere orthogonal to any two spheres of a pencil of spheres is orthogonal to all of them and its center lies in the radical plane of the pencil.&lt;ref name=Woods267 /&gt;

==Terminology==
Pairs of points on a sphere that lie on a straight line through the sphere's center are called [[antipodal point]]s. A [[great circle]] is a circle on the sphere that has the same center and radius as the sphere and, consequently, divides it into two equal parts. The [[plane section]]s of a sphere are called ''spheric sections''. They are all circles and those that are not great circles are called [[Circle of a sphere|''small circles'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |id=SphericSection |title=Spheric section}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The shortest distance along the surface between two distinct non-antipodal points on the sphere is the length of the smaller of the two arcs on the unique great circle that includes the two points. Equipped with this "[[great-circle distance]]", a great circle becomes the [[Riemannian circle]].

If a particular point on a sphere is (arbitrarily) designated as its ''north pole'', then the corresponding antipodal point is called the ''south pole'', and the [[equator]] is the great circle that is equidistant to them. Great circles through the two poles are called lines (or [[meridian (geography)|meridians]]) of [[longitude]], and the line connecting the two poles is called the [[axis of rotation]]. Circles on the sphere that are parallel to the equator are lines of [[latitude]]. This terminology is also used for such approximately [[spheroid]]al [[astronomical bodies]] as the planet [[Earth]] (see [[geoid]]).

==Hemisphere==
{{anchor|hemisphere}}

Any plane that includes the center of a sphere divides it into two equal '''hemispheres'''. Any two intersecting planes that include the center of a sphere subdivide the sphere into four [[spherical lune|lunes]] or biangles, the vertices of which all coincide with the [[antipodal point]]s lying on the line of intersection of the planes.

The antipodal quotient of the sphere is the surface called the [[real projective plane]], which can also be thought of as the [[northern hemisphere]] with antipodal points of the equator identified.

The hemisphere is [[filling area conjecture|conjectured]] to be the optimal (least area) isometric filling of the [[Riemannian circle]].

==Generalizations==
===Dimensionality===
{{Main|n-sphere}}
Spheres can be generalized to spaces of any number of [[dimension]]s. For any [[natural number]] {{mvar|n}}, an "{{mvar|n}}-sphere," often written as {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, is the set of points in ({{math|''n'' + 1}})-dimensional Euclidean space that are at a fixed distance {{mvar|r}} from a central point of that space, where {{mvar|r}} is, as before, a positive real number. In particular:
*{{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}: a 0-sphere is a pair of endpoints of an interval {{math|[−''r'', ''r'']}} of the real line
*{{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}: a 1-sphere is a [[circle]] of radius ''r''
*{{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}: a 2-sphere is an ordinary sphere
*{{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}: a [[3-sphere]] is a sphere in 4-dimensional Euclidean space.

Spheres for {{math|''n'' &gt; 2}} are sometimes called [[hypersphere]]s.

The {{mvar|n}}-sphere of unit radius centered at the origin is denoted {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and is often referred to as "the" {{mvar|n}}-sphere. Note that the ordinary sphere is a 2-sphere, because it is a 2-dimensional surface (which is embedded in 3-dimensional space).

The surface area of the unit ({{math|''n''-1}})-sphere is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2 \pi^{\frac{n}{2}}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Γ(''z'')}} is Euler's [[gamma function]].

Another expression for the surface area is
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}
 \displaystyle \frac{(2\pi)^{n/2}\,r^{n-1}}{2 \cdot 4 \cdots (n-2)}, &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\
 \displaystyle \frac{2(2\pi)^{(n-1)/2}\,r^{n-1}}{1 \cdot 3 \cdots (n-2)}, &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd}.
 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

and the volume is the surface area times {{math|{{sfrac|''r''|''n''}}}} or
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}
 \displaystyle \frac{(2\pi)^{n/2}\,r^n}{2 \cdot 4 \cdots n}, &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\
 \displaystyle \frac{2(2\pi)^{(n-1)/2}\,r^n}{1 \cdot 3 \cdots n}, &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd}.
 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

General recursive formulas also exist for the [[volume of an n-ball|volume of an {{mvar|n}}-ball]].

===Metric spaces===
More generally, in a [[metric space]] {{math|(''E'',''d'')}}, the sphere of center {{mvar|x}} and radius {{math|''r'' &gt; 0}} is the set of points {{mvar|y}} such that {{math|1=''d''(''x'',''y'') = ''r''}}.

If the center is a distinguished point that is considered to be the origin of {{mvar|E}}, as in a [[norm (mathematics)|normed]] space, it is not mentioned in the definition and notation. The same applies for the radius if it is taken to equal one, as in the case of a [[unit sphere]].

Unlike a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]], even a large sphere may be an empty set. For example, in {{math|'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with [[Euclidean metric]], a sphere of radius {{math|''r''}} is nonempty only if {{math|''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be written as sum of {{math|''n''}} squares of [[integer]]s.

==Topology==
In [[topology]], an {{mvar|n}}-sphere is defined as a space [[homeomorphic]] to the boundary of an [[ball (mathematics)#Topological balls|{{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball]]; thus, it is [[homeomorphic]] to the Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-sphere, but perhaps lacking its [[Metric space|metric]].
*A 0-sphere is a pair of points with the [[discrete topology]].
*A 1-sphere is a circle ([[up to]] [[homeomorphism]]); thus, for example, (the image of) any [[Knot (mathematics)|knot]] is a 1-sphere.
*A 2-sphere is an ordinary sphere ([[up to]] [[homeomorphism]]); thus, for example, any [[spheroid]] is a 2-sphere.

The {{mvar|n}}-sphere is denoted {{math|''S&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}}. It is an example of a [[compact space|compact]] [[topological manifold]] without [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]]. A sphere need not be [[Manifold#Differentiable manifolds|smooth]]; if it is smooth, it need not be [[diffeomorphic]] to the Euclidean sphere.

The [[Heine–Borel theorem]] implies that a Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-sphere is compact. The sphere is the inverse image of a one-point set under the continuous function {{math|{{norm|''x''}}}}. Therefore, the sphere is closed. {{math|''S&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is also bounded; therefore it is compact.

Remarkably, it is possible to turn an ordinary sphere inside out in a [[three-dimensional space]] with possible self-intersections but without creating any crease, in a process called [[sphere eversion]].

==Spherical geometry==
[[Image:Sphere halve.png|thumb|right|[[Great circle]] on a sphere]]
{{Main|Spherical geometry}}
The basic elements of [[Euclidean plane geometry]] are [[Point (geometry)|points]] and [[line (mathematics)|lines]]. On the sphere, points are defined in the usual sense. The analogue of the "line" is the [[geodesic]], which is a [[great circle]]; the defining characteristic of a great circle is that the plane containing all its points also passes through the center of the sphere. Measuring by [[arc length]] shows that the shortest path between two points lying on the sphere is the shorter segment of the [[great circle]] that includes the points.

Many theorems from [[classical geometry]] hold true for spherical geometry as well, but not all do because the sphere fails to satisfy some of classical geometry's [[postulate]]s, including the [[parallel postulate]]. In [[spherical trigonometry]], [[angle]]s are defined between great circles. Spherical trigonometry differs from ordinary [[trigonometry]] in many respects. For example, the sum of the interior angles of a [[spherical triangle]] always exceeds 180&amp;nbsp;degrees. Also, any two [[similar triangles|similar]] spherical triangles are congruent.

==Eleven properties of the sphere==
[[Image:Sphere section.png|thumb|A normal vector to a sphere, a normal plane and its normal section. The curvature of the curve of intersection is the sectional curvature. For the sphere each normal section through a given point will be a circle of the same radius: the radius of the sphere. This means that every point on the sphere will be an umbilical point.]]

In their book ''Geometry and the Imagination''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author=[[David Hilbert|Hilbert, David]]; Cohn-Vossen, Stephan
|title=Geometry and the Imagination
|edition=2nd
|year=1952
|publisher=Chelsea
|isbn=0-8284-1087-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hilbert]] and [[Stephan Cohn-Vossen]] describe eleven properties of the sphere and discuss whether these properties uniquely determine the sphere. Several properties hold for the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]], which can be thought of as a sphere with infinite radius. These properties are:
#''The points on the sphere are all the same distance from a fixed point. Also, the ratio of the distance of its points from two fixed points is constant.''
#:The first part is the usual definition of the sphere and determines it uniquely. The second part can be easily deduced and follows a similar [[Circle#Circle of Apollonius|result]] of [[Apollonius of Perga]] for the [[circle]]. This second part also holds for the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]].
#''The contours and plane sections of the sphere are circles.''
#:This property defines the sphere uniquely.
#''The sphere has constant width and constant girth.''
#:The width of a surface is the distance between pairs of parallel tangent planes. Numerous other closed convex surfaces have constant width, for example the [[Meissner body]]. The girth of a surface is the [[circumference]] of the boundary of its orthogonal projection on to a plane. Each of these properties implies the other.
#''All points of a sphere are [[umbilic]]s.''
#:At any point on a surface a [[Normal (geometry)|normal direction]] is at right angles to the surface because the sphere these are the lines radiating out from the center of the sphere. The intersection of a plane that contains the normal with the surface will form a curve that is called a ''normal section,'' and the curvature of this curve is the ''normal curvature''. For most points on most surfaces, different sections will have different curvatures; the maximum and minimum values of these are called the [[principal curvature]]s. Any closed surface will have at least four points called ''[[umbilical point]]s''. At an umbilic all the sectional curvatures are equal; in particular the [[principal curvature]]s are equal. Umbilical points can be thought of as the points where the surface is closely approximated by a sphere.
#:For the sphere the curvatures of all normal sections are equal, so every point is an umbilic. The sphere and plane are the only surfaces with this property.
#''The sphere does not have a surface of centers.''
#:For a given normal section exists a circle of curvature that equals the sectional curvature, is tangent to the surface, and the center lines of which lie along on the normal line. For example, the two centers corresponding to the maximum and minimum sectional curvatures are called the ''focal points'', and the set of all such centers forms the [[focal surface]].
#:For most surfaces the focal surface forms two sheets that are each a surface and meet at umbilical points. Several cases are special:
#:* For [[channel surface]]s one sheet forms a curve and the other sheet is a surface
#:* For [[Cone (geometry)|cones]], cylinders, [[torus|tori]] and [[Dupin cyclide|cyclides]] both sheets form curves.
#:* For the sphere the center of every osculating circle is at the center of the sphere and the focal surface forms a single point. This property is unique to the sphere.
#''All geodesics of the sphere are closed curves.''
#:[[Geodesics]] are curves on a surface that give the shortest distance between two points. They are a generalization of the concept of a straight line in the plane. For the sphere the geodesics are great circles. Many other surfaces share this property.
#''Of all the solids having a given volume, the sphere is the one with the smallest surface area; of all solids having a given surface area, the sphere is the one having the greatest volume.''
#:It follows from [[isoperimetric inequality]]. These properties define the sphere uniquely and can be seen in [[soap bubble]]s: a soap bubble will enclose a fixed volume, and [[surface tension]] minimizes its surface area for that volume. A freely floating soap bubble therefore approximates a sphere (though such external forces as gravity will slightly distort the bubble's shape).
#''The sphere has the smallest total mean curvature among all convex solids with a given surface area.''
#:The [[mean curvature]] is the average of the two principal curvatures, which is constant because the two principal curvatures are constant at all points of the sphere.
#''The sphere has constant mean curvature.''
#:The sphere is the only imbedded surface that lacks boundary or singularities with constant positive mean curvature. Other such immersed surfaces as [[minimal surface]]s have constant mean curvature.
#''The sphere has constant positive Gaussian curvature.''
#:[[Gaussian curvature]] is the product of the two principal curvatures. It is an intrinsic property that can be determined by measuring length and angles and is independent of how the surface is [[embedding|embedded]] in space. Hence, bending a surface will not alter the Gaussian curvature, and other surfaces with constant positive Gaussian curvature can be obtained by cutting a small slit in the sphere and bending it. All these other surfaces would have boundaries, and the sphere is the only surface that lacks a boundary with constant, positive Gaussian curvature. The [[pseudosphere]] is an example of a surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature.
#''The sphere is transformed into itself by a three-parameter family of rigid motions.''
#:Rotating around any axis a unit sphere at the origin will map the sphere onto itself. Any rotation about a line through the origin can be expressed as a combination of rotations around the three-coordinate axis (see [[Euler angles]]). Therefore, a three-parameter family of rotations exists such that each rotation transforms the sphere onto itself; this family is the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. The plane is the only other surface with a three-parameter family of transformations (translations along the {{mvar|x}}- and {{mvar|y}}-axes and rotations around the origin). Circular cylinders are the only surfaces with two-parameter families of rigid motions and the [[Surface of revolution|surfaces of revolution]] and [[helicoid]]s are the only surfaces with a one-parameter family.

A '''sub-orbital spaceflight''' is a [[spaceflight]] in which the [[spacecraft]] reaches [[outer space]], but its [[trajectory]] intersects the [[atmosphere]] or surface of the [[primary (astronomy)|gravitating body]] from which it was launched, so that it will not complete one [[orbit]]al revolution.

For example, the path of an object launched from [[Earth]] that reaches the [[Kármán line]] (at {{cvt|100|km|mi|0}} above [[sea level]]), and then falls back to Earth, is considered a sub-orbital spaceflight. Some sub-orbital flights have been undertaken to test spacecraft and [[launch vehicle]]s later intended for [[orbital spaceflight]]. Other vehicles are specifically designed only for sub-orbital flight; examples include manned vehicles, such as the [[North American X-15|X-15]] and [[SpaceShipOne]], and unmanned ones, such as [[intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]] and [[sounding rocket]]s.

Flights which attain sufficient velocity to go into [[low Earth orbit]], and then [[de-orbit]] before completing their first full orbit, are not considered sub-orbital. Examples of this include [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s [[Vostok 1]], and flights of the [[Fractional Orbital Bombardment System]].

Usually a rocket is used, but experimental sub-orbital spaceflight has also been achieved with a [[space gun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/fam/martlet.htm |title=Martlet |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926022558/http://www.astronautix.com/fam/martlet.htm |archive-date=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Altitude requirement==
[[Image:Newton Cannon.svg|thumb|right|[[Newton's cannonball|Isaac Newton's Cannonball]]. Paths A and B depict a sub-orbital trajectory.]]
By one definition a sub-orbital spaceflight reaches an [[altitude]] higher than {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]]. This altitude, known as the Kármán line, was chosen by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] because it is roughly the point where a [[vehicle]] flying fast enough to support itself with [[aerodynamic lift]] from the [[Earth's atmosphere]] would be flying faster than [[orbital speed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/icare-records/100km-altitude-boundary-for-astronautics|title=100 km Altitude Boundary for Astronautics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/618QHms8h?url=http://www.fai.org/astronautics/100km.asp|archive-date=2011-08-22|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US military and NASA award [[Astronaut Badge|astronaut wings]] to those flying above {{convert|50|mi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/NewsReleases/2005/05-57.html|title=X-15 Space Pioneers Now Honored as Astronauts|first=Mary|last=Whelan|date=5 June 2013|website=nasa.gov|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611194526/https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/NewsReleases/2005/05-57.html|archivedate=11 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[U.S. State Department]] appears to not support a distinct boundary between atmospheric flight and [[spaceflight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/s/l/22718.htm|title=85.

==Orbit==
During [[freefall]] the trajectory is part of an [[elliptic orbit]] as given by the [[orbit equation]]. The [[perigee]] distance is less than the [[radius of the Earth]] ''R'' including atmosphere, hence the [[ellipse]] intersects the Earth, and hence the spacecraft will fail to complete an orbit. The major axis is vertical, the [[semi-major axis]] ''a'' is more than ''R''/2. The [[specific orbital energy]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = -{\mu \over{2a}} &gt; -{\mu \over{R}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard gravitational parameter]].

Almost always ''a'' &lt; ''R'', corresponding to a lower &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; than the minimum for a full orbit, which is &lt;math&gt;-{\mu \over{2R}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the net extra specific energy needed compared to just raising the spacecraft into space is between 0 and &lt;math&gt;\mu \over{2R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

==Speed, range and altitude==
To minimize the required [[delta-v]] (an [[astrodynamics|astrodynamical]] measure which strongly determines the required [[fuel]]), the high-altitude part of the flight is made with the [[rocket]]s off (this is technically called free-fall even for the upward part of the trajectory). (Compare with [[Oberth effect]].) The maximum [[speed]] in a flight is attained at the lowest altitude of this free-fall trajectory, both at the start and at the end of it.

If one's goal is simply to "reach space", for example in competing for the [[Ansari X Prize]], horizontal motion is not needed. In this case the lowest required delta-v, to reach 100&amp;nbsp;km altitude, is about 1.4&amp;nbsp;[[km/s]]. Moving slower, with less free-fall, would require more delta-v.

Compare this with orbital spaceflights: a low Earth orbit (LEO), with an altitude of about 300&amp;nbsp;km, needs a speed around 7.7&amp;nbsp;km/s, requiring a delta-v of about 9.2&amp;nbsp;km/s. (If there were no atmospheric drag the theoretical minimum delta-v would be 8.1&amp;nbsp;km/s to put a craft into a 300-km high orbit starting from a stationary point like the South Pole. The theoretical minimum can be up to 0.46&amp;nbsp;km/s less if launching eastward from near the equator.)

For sub-orbital spaceflights covering a horizontal distance the maximum speed and required delta-v are in between those of a vertical flight and a LEO. The maximum speed at the lower ends of the trajectory are now composed of a horizontal and a vertical component. The higher the horizontal [[distance]] covered, the greater the horizontal speed will be. (The vertical velocity will increase with distance for short distances but will decrease with distance at longer distances.) For the [[V-2 rocket]], just reaching space but with a range of about 330&amp;nbsp;km, the maximum speed was 1.6&amp;nbsp;km/s. [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipTwo]] which is under development will have a similar free-fall orbit but the announced maximum speed is 1.1&amp;nbsp;km/s (perhaps because of engine shut-off at a higher altitude).

For larger ranges, due to the elliptic orbit the maximum altitude can be much more than for a LEO. On a 10,000-km intercontinental flight, such as that of an intercontinental ballistic missile or possible future [[commercial spaceflight]], the maximum speed is about 7&amp;nbsp;km/s, and the maximum altitude may be more than 1300&amp;nbsp;km.
Any [[spaceflight]] that returns to the surface, including sub-orbital ones, will undergo [[atmospheric reentry]]. The speed at the start of the reentry is basically the maximum speed of the flight. The [[aerodynamic heating]] caused will vary accordingly: it is much less for a flight with a maximum speed of only 1&amp;nbsp;km/s than for one with a maximum speed of 7 or 8&amp;nbsp;km/s.

We can calculate the minimum delta-v and the corresponding maximum altitude for a given range, ''d'', assuming a spherical earth of circumference 40 000&amp;nbsp;km and neglecting the earth's rotation and atmosphere. Let θ be half the angle that the projectile is to go around the earth, so in degrees it is 45°×''d''/10 000&amp;nbsp;km. The minimum-delta-v trajectory corresponds to an ellipse with one focus at the centre of the earth and the other at the point halfway between the launch point and the destination point (somewhere inside the earth). (This is the orbit that minimizes the semi-major axis, which is equal to the sum of the distances from a point on the orbit to the two foci. Minimizing the semi-major axis minimizes the [[specific orbital energy]] and thus the delta-v, which is the speed of launch.) Geometrical arguments lead then to the following (with ''R'' being the radius of the earth, about 6370&amp;nbsp;km):

&lt;math&gt;\text{major axis}=(1+\sin\theta)R&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{minor axis}=R\sqrt{2(\sin\theta+\sin^2\theta)}=\sqrt{(R\sin\theta)\text{semi-major axis}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{distance of apogee from centre of earth}=(1+\sin\theta+\cos\theta)R/2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{altitude of apogee above surface}=\left(\frac{\sin\theta}2-\sin^2\frac\theta 2\right)R=\left(\frac{\sin(\theta+\pi/4)}\sqrt{2}-\frac 1 2\right)R&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the altitude of apogee is maximized (at about 1320&amp;nbsp;km) for a trajectory going one quarter of the way around the earth (10 000&amp;nbsp;km). Longer ranges will have lower apogees in the minimal-delta-v solution.

&lt;math&gt;\text{specific kinetic energy at launch}=\frac\mu R-\frac\mu\text{major axis}=\frac\mu R\frac{\sin\theta}{1+\sin\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta v=\text{speed at launch}=\sqrt{2\frac\mu R\frac{\sin\theta}{1+\sin\theta}}=\sqrt{2gR\frac{\sin\theta}{1+\sin\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;

(where ''g'' is the acceleration of gravity at the earth's surface). We see that the Δv increases with range, leveling off at 7.9&amp;nbsp;km/s as the range approaches 20 000&amp;nbsp;km (halfway around the world). The minimum-delta-v trajectory for going halfway around the world corresponds to a circular orbit just above the surface (of course in reality it would have to be above the atmosphere). See lower for the time of flight.

An [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] is defined as a missile that can hit a target at least 5500&amp;nbsp;km away, and according to the above formula this requires an initial speed of 6.1&amp;nbsp;km/s. Increasing the speed to 7.9&amp;nbsp;km/s to attain any point on Earth requires a considerably larger missile because the amount of fuel needed goes up exponentially with delta-v (see [[Rocket equation]]).

The initial direction of a minimum-delta-v trajectory points halfway between straight up and straight toward the destination point (which is below the horizon). Again, this is the case if we ignore the earth's rotation. It is not exactly true for a rotating planet unless the launch takes place at a pole.

==Flight duration==
In a vertical flight of not too high altitudes, the time of the free-fall is both for the upward and for the downward part the maximum speed divided by the [[Standard gravity|acceleration of gravity]], so with a maximum speed of 1&amp;nbsp;km/s together 3 minutes and 20 seconds. The duration of the [[flight]] phases before and after the free-fall can vary.

For an intercontinental flight the [[boost phase]] takes 3 to 5 minutes, the free-fall (midcourse phase) about 25 minutes. For an ICBM the atmospheric reentry phase takes about 2 minutes; this will be longer for any soft landing, such as for a possible future commercial flight.

Sub-orbital flights can last many hours. [[Pioneer 1]] was [[NASA]]'s first [[space probe]], intended to reach the [[Moon]]. A partial failure caused it to instead follow a sub-orbital trajectory, reentering the Earth's atmosphere 43 hours after launch.

To calculate the time of flight for a minimum-delta-v trajectory, we first find that, according to [[Kepler's third law]], the period for the entire orbit (if it didn't go through the earth) would be:

&lt;math&gt;\text{period}=(\text{semi-major axis}/R)^{3/2}\times\text{period of low earth orbit}=\left(\frac{1+\sin\theta}2\right)^{3/2}2\pi\sqrt{R/g}&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[Kepler's second law]], we multiply this by the portion of the area of the ellipse swept by the line from the centre of the earth to the projectile:

&lt;math&gt;\text{area fraction}=\frac{\arcsin\sqrt{\frac{2\sin\theta}{1+\sin\theta}}}\pi+\frac{2\cos\theta\sin\theta}{\pi\text{(major axis)(minor axis)}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{time of flight}&amp;=\left(\left(\frac{1+\sin\theta}2\right)^{3/2}\arcsin\sqrt{\frac{2\sin\theta}{1+\sin\theta}}+\frac 1 2\cos\theta\sqrt{\sin\theta}\right)2\sqrt\frac R g\\
&amp;=\left(\left(\frac{1+\sin\theta}2\right)^{3/2}\arccos\frac{\cos\theta}{1+\sin\theta}+\frac 1 2\cos\theta\sqrt{\sin\theta}\right)2\sqrt\frac R g\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This gives about 32 minutes for going a quarter of the way around the earth, and 42 minutes for going halfway around. For short distances, this expression is [[asymptotic]] to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2d/g}&lt;/math&gt;.

As one can see from the form involving arccosine, the derivative of the time of flight with respect to ''d'' (or θ) goes to zero as ''d'' approaches 20 000&amp;nbsp;km (halfway around the world). The derivative of Δv also goes to zero here. So if ''d'' = 19 000&amp;nbsp;km, the length of the minimum-delta-v trajectory will be about 19 500&amp;nbsp;km, but it will take only a few seconds less time than the trajectory for ''d'' = 20 000&amp;nbsp;km (for which the trajectory is 20 000&amp;nbsp;km long).

==Flight profiles==

[[File:Mr3-flight-timeline-simple.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Profile for the first manned American sub-orbital flight, 1961. Launch rocket lifts the spacecraft for the first 2:22 minutes. Dashed line: zero gravity.]]
While there are a great many possible sub-orbital flight profiles, it is expected that some will be more common than others.

[[File:X-15.jpg|thumb|The X-15 (1958–68) would lift itself to an altitude of approximately 100 km and then glide down.]]

===Ballistic missiles===
The first sub-orbital vehicles which reached space were [[ballistic missiles]]. The very first ballistic missile to reach space was the German [[V-2 rocket|V-2]], the work of the scientists at [[Peenemünde]], on October 3, 1942 which reached an altitude of {{convert|60|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;Germany's V-2 Rocket, Kennedy, Gregory P.&lt;/ref&gt; Then in the late 1940s the USA and [[USSR]] concurrently developed missiles all of which were based on the V-2 Rocket, and then much longer range Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). There are now many countries who possess ICBMs and even more with shorter range [[IRBM]]s (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles).

===Tourist flights===
[[Space tourism|Sub-orbital tourist flights]] will initially focus on attaining the altitude required to qualify as reaching space. The flight path will probably be either vertical or very steep, with the spacecraft landing back at its take-off site.

The spacecraft will probably shut off its [[engine]]s well before reaching maximum altitude, and then coast up to its highest point. During a few minutes, from the point when the engines are shut off to the point where the atmosphere begins to slow down the downward acceleration, the passengers will experience [[weightlessness]].

[[Megaroc]] had been planned for sub-orbital spaceflight by the [[British Interplanetary Society]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150824-how-a-nazi-rocket-could-have-put-a-briton-in-space|title=How a Nazi rocket could have put a Briton in space|first=Richard|last=Hollingham|date=|website=bbc.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114032515/http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150824-how-a-nazi-rocket-could-have-put-a-briton-in-space|archivedate=14 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis-space.com/what-we-do/projects/megaroc|title=Megaroc|author=|date=|website=www.bis-space.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030133900/http://www.bis-space.com/what-we-do/projects/megaroc|archivedate=30 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1945, the group M. Tikhonravov K. and N. G. Chernysheva at NII-4 rocket artillery Academy of Sciences technology on its own initiative the first stratospheric rocket project was developed by [[Project BP-190|BP-190]] for vertical flight two pilots to an altitude of 200&amp;nbsp;km based on captured German ballistic rocket [[V-2 rocket|V-2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Anatoli I.

In 2004, a number of companies worked on vehicles in this class as entrants to the Ansari X Prize competition. The [[Scaled Composites]] [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne|SpaceShipOne]] was officially declared by [[Richard A. Searfoss|Rick Searfoss]] to have won the competition on October 4, 2004 after completing two flights within a two-week period.

In 2005, [[Richard Branson|Sir Richard Branson]] of the [[Virgin Group]] announced the creation of [[Virgin Galactic]] and his plans for a 9-seat capacity SpaceShipTwo named [[VSS Enterprise|VSS ''Enterprise'']]. It has since been completed with eight seats (one pilot, one co-pilot and six passengers) and has taken part in captive-carry tests and with the first mother-ship [[WhiteKnightTwo]], or [[VMS Eve]]. It has also completed solitary glides, with the movable tail sections in both fixed and "feathered" configurations.  The [[hybrid rocket]] motor has been fired multiple times in ground-based test stands, and was fired in a powered flight for the second time on 5 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scaled.com/projects/test_logs/35/model_339_spaceshiptwo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816140953/http://www.scaled.com/projects/test_logs/35/model_339_spaceshiptwo |archivedate=2013-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four additional SpaceShipTwos have been ordered and will operate from the new [[Spaceport America]]. Commercial flights carrying passengers were expected in 2014, but became cancelled due to the [[VSS Enterprise crash|disaster during SS2 PF04 flight]]. Branson stated, "[w]e are going to learn from what went wrong, discover how we can improve safety and performance and then move forwards together."&lt;ref&gt;"Branson on Virgin Galactic crash: 'Space is hard – but worth it'". CNET. Retrieved August 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific experiments===
A major use of sub-orbital vehicles today are as [[scientific]] [[sounding rocket]]s. Scientific sub-orbital flights began in the 1920s when [[Robert H. Goddard]] launched the first [[liquid fuel]]ed rockets, however they did not reach [[space]] altitude. In the late 1940s, captured German [[V-2 rocket|V-2 ballistic missiles]] were converted into [[V-2 sounding rocket]]s which helped lay the foundation for modern sounding rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ch2|url = https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4401/ch2.htm|website = history.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151129091504/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4401/ch2.htm|archivedate = 2015-11-29|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are dozens of different sounding rockets on the market, from a variety of suppliers in various countries. Typically, researchers wish to conduct experiments in [[microgravity]] or above the atmosphere.

===Sub-orbital transportation===
Research, such as that done for the [[X-20 Dyna-Soar]] project suggests that a semi-ballistic sub-orbital flight could travel from Europe to North America in less than an hour.

However, the size of rocket, relative to the payload, necessary to achieve this, is similar to an ICBM. ICBMs have delta-v's somewhat less than orbital; and therefore would be somewhat cheaper than the costs for reaching orbit, but the difference is not large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1118/1|title=The Space Review: Point-to-point suborbital transportation: sounds good on paper, but…|author=|date=|website=www.thespacereview.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801074751/http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1118/1|archivedate=1 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus due to the high cost, this is likely to be initially limited to high value, very high urgency cargo such as [[courier]] flights, or as the ultimate [[business jet]]; or possibly as an [[extreme sport]], or for [[military]] fast-response.{{opinion|date=April 2012}}

The [[SpaceLiner]] is a hypersonic [[suborbital spaceplane]] concept that could transport 50 passengers from [[Australia]] to [[Europe]] in 90 minutes or 100 passengers from Europe to [[California]] in 60 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576510000445| author = Sippel, M. | title = Promising roadmap alternatives for the SpaceLiner |publisher = Acta Astronautica |issue = 11–12 |volume = 66 |date = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main challenge lies in increasing the reliability of the different components, particularly the engines, in order to make their use for passenger transportation on a daily basis possible.

[[SpaceX]] is planning to use its [[BFR (rocket)|BFR]] launch vehicle as a sub-orbital point-to-point transport.

==Notable unmanned sub-orbital spaceflights==
* The first sub-orbital space flight was in June 1944, when [[MW 18014|a V-2 test rocket]] launched from [[Peenemünde]] in Germany reached 189 kilometres altitude.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Dornberger, Moewig, Berlin 1984. {{ISBN|3-8118-4341-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bumper (rocket)|Bumper]] 5, a two-stage rocket launched from the [[White Sands Proving Grounds]]. On 24 February 1949 the upper stage reached an altitude of {{convert|248|mi|km}} and a speed of 7,553 [[feet per second]] (2300 meters per second approx.)&lt;ref&gt;

==Future of manned sub-orbital spaceflight==
[[Private companies]] such as [[Virgin Galactic]], [[XCOR]], [[Armadillo Aerospace]] (reinvented as Exos Aerospace), [[Airbus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-27686906|title=Airbus drops model 'space jet'|first=Jonathan|last=Amos|date=3 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504004642/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-27686906|archivedate=4 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Blue Origin]] and [[Masten Space Systems]] are taking an interest in sub-orbital spaceflight, due in part to ventures like the Ansari X Prize. NASA and others are experimenting with [[scramjet]] based [[hypersonic]] aircraft which may well be used with flight profiles that qualify as sub-orbital spaceflight. [[Non-profit]] entities like [[ARCASPACE]] and [[Copenhagen Suborbitals]] also attempt [[rocket]]-based launches.

'''Vested interest''' (Crano, 1983&lt;ref name="Crano"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Crano | first=William D. | title= Assumed consensus of attitudes: The effect of vested interest | journal= Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume=9 | year=1983 | pages=597-607}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Crano &amp; Prislin, 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Crano | first=William D. | last2=Prislin | first2=Radmila | title=Components of Vested Interest and Attitude-Behavior Consistency | journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology | publisher=Informa UK Limited | volume=17 | issue=1-2 | year=1995 | issn=0197-3533 | doi=10.1080/01973533.1995.9646129 | pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Sivacek &amp; Crano, 1982&lt;ref name=" Sivacek "&gt;{{cite journal | last= Sivacek | first=J. | last2=Crano | first2=W.D. | title= Vested interest as a moderator of attitude-behavior consistency | journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume=43 | year=1982 | pages=210-221}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[communication theory]] that seeks to explain how certain hedonically relevant (Miller &amp; Averbeck, 2013)&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Miller | first=C. H. | last2=Averbeck | first2=J. M. | title= Hedonic relevance and outcome relevant involvement | journal= Electronic Journal of Communication | publisher= Communication Institute for Online Scholarship, Inc.(CIOS) | volume=23 | issue=3 | year=2013}} | Retrieved from the CIOS  http://www.cios.org/www.cios.org/EJCPUBLIC/023/3/023031.html | &lt;/ref&gt; attitudinal dimensions can influence and consistently predict behavior based on the degree of subjective investment an individual has in a particular attitude object. As defined by [[William Crano]], ''vested interest'' refers to the degree to which an attitude object is deemed [[wikt:hedonic|hedonic]]ally relevant by the attitude holder. According to Crano, "an attitude object that has important perceived personal consequences for the individual will be perceived as highly vested. Highly vested attitudes will be functionally related to behavior" (Crano, 1983). Simply put, when people have more at stake with the result of an object (like a law or policy) that will greatly affect them, they will behave in a way that will directly support or defy the object for the sake of their own self-interest.

For example, a 30-year-old learns that the legal driving age in his state is being raised from 16 to 17. While he may not agree with this proposed change, he is not affected as much as a 15-year-old would be and is unlikely to protest the change. A 15-year-old, however, has much to lose (waiting another year to get a driver license) and is more likely to vehemently oppose the new proposed law. To gather support for his position, a course of action the 15-year-old might take would be to tell other soon-to-be drivers about the new law, so that they collectively have a vested interest in perhaps changing the law. This example illustrates the point that highly vested attitudes concerning issues depend on the situational point of view.

Another example of vested interest can be found in a study conducted by Berndsen, Spears and van der Pligt&lt;ref name="Berndsen, Spears, van der Pligt"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berndsen |first1=M. |last2=Spears |first2=R. |last3=van der Pligt |first3=J. |title=Illusory Correlation and Attitude-Based Vested Interest |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |date=1996 |volume=26 |issue=2 |page=252-253 |issn=0046-2772}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which involves students from a University in Amsterdam where the teaching faculty proposed the use of English to teach the curriculum instead of Dutch.  Vested interest, in this case, suggests that students would be opposed to the use of English rather than Dutch simply based on the potential impact lectures conducted in English might have on their grades. &lt;ref name="Berndsen, Spears, van der Pligt" /&gt;  

==Key Factors==
===Involvement===
A key factor to consider with vested interest is the level or type of involvement the individual has with a particular attitude object. This can be broken up into three main involvement components: Value-relevant, Impression-relevant, and Outcome-relevant. Value-relevant involvement concerns behaviors which support/reinforce values of the individual. Impression-relevant involvement relates to those behaviors which serve to create or maintain a specific image of the individual. This could, in some ways, be compared to a [[Self-monitoring|low-self monitor]]. Outcome-relevant involvement concerns those behaviors which hold direct personal consequences at a premium for the individual and as a result, corresponds most closely to vested interest.&lt;ref name="Crano"/&gt;

The concept of involvement closely relates to collaboration which encompasses value, impression and desired outcome.  Vested interest is essential in achieving success in collaboration where two or more individuals have the potential to gain or lose. &lt;ref name="Guard"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guard |first1=R. |title=Musing on Collaboration and Vested Interest |journal=The Journal of Academic Librarianship |date=2005 |volume=31 |issue=2 |page=89-90 |issn=0099-1333}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizations who strive for collaborative success benefit from understanding vested interest and that of other collaborators in order to maintain a supportive level of involvement. &lt;ref name="Guard" /&gt;

===Ego involvement===
The way people view vested interest as distinct from ego involvement, is a construct that has been the topic of social psychological research for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, M., &amp; Hovland, C. (1961). Social judgment: Assimilation and contrast effects in communication and attitude change. Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by John Sivacek and William D. Crano,&lt;ref name="S&amp;C"&gt;Sivacek, J., &amp; Crano, W. D. (1982). Vested interest as a moderator of attitude behavior consistency. 'Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 43, 210-221&lt;/ref&gt; they prove that the aforementioned statement of ego involvement and vested interest are indeed separate. Sivacek and Crano state,&lt;ref name="S&amp;C"/&gt; "It was possible to have circumstances that an individual would perceive as involving but that it would not arouse his or her vested interest." [[Id, ego and super-ego|Ego]]-involvement’s main focus points are on individual’s psychological attitudes that are experienced as being a part of “me”. The more emotionally connected people are to an idea, concept, or value, minor differences in beliefs can be viewed as significantly large and perhaps make harsh judgments or have stronger reactions. Conversely, a person with less emotional connectivity (low ego-involvement) will have more latitude in their reactions. It is important to note that while highly vested attitudes can be experienced as ego involving, the opposite is not always true. An individual can be ego involved in a certain attitude that has no hedonic consequence. For example, religious or political ideals with little or no hedonic value may still be ego-involved because individuals view those types of beliefs as part of who they are.

Ego-involvement, as it pertains to vested interest, is relative to [[Social_judgment_theory|Social Judgment Theory]] in that the concept of one’s identity is the primary focus of efforts in continued involvement. &lt;ref name="Sherif et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sherif |first1=C. W. |last2=Kelly |first2=M. |last3=Rodgers Jr. |first3=H. L. |last4=Sarup |first4=G. |last5=Tittler |first5=B. L. |title=Personal Involvement, Social Judgment, and Action |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=1973 |volume=27 |issue=3 |page=311-313 |doi=10.1037/h0034948}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Essential to social judgment theory is the idea of ego thus actions or ideas with a varying degree of ego involvement carry a commensurate amount of vested interest to the individual as detailed by Sherif, Kelly, Rogers, Sarup, and Tittler.  Sherif, et al.&lt;ref name="Sherif et al." /&gt; conducted a series of studies to develop “indicators of ego involvement” (p. 311).  One of the leading questions they sought to answer was how much ego involvement (vested interest) does an induvial in a situation with no alternatives solutions have and does this ego involvement correlate to the number of options at hand. &lt;ref name="Sherif et al." /&gt; Sherif et al., suggest the question was answered by Beck and Nebergall&lt;ref name="Beck &amp; Neberall"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Beck |first1=D. |last2=Nebergall |first2=R. E. |last3=Sherif |first3=C.W. |last4=Kelly |first4=M. |last5=Rodgers Jr. |first5=H.L. |last6=Sarup |first6=G. |last7=Tittler |first7=B.L. |title=Relationship Between Attitude Neutrality and Involvement; (in Personal Involvement, Social Judgment, and Action) |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1974-05117-001 |website=PsycNET |publisher=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |accessdate=21 June 2018 |doi=10.1037/h0034948}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967 who stated that individuals with little to no options have corresponding vested interest indicating low ego involvement. &lt;ref name="Sherif et al." /&gt;

===Attitude importance===
The factor to consider with vested interest and its application towards attitude-consistent actions is attitude importance. [[Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]] (or issue) importance concerns not only matters of personal consequence, but also matters of national or international interest.&lt;ref name="Crano"/&gt; While both of these can fall in line with each other, vested interest and attitude importance are not the same. For example, consider the plight of an African nation that has been ravaged by an influenza epidemic. Although an individual in America may consider this objectively important, because of the low probability of personal consequence—i.e., vested interest — his resultant behavior may not be indicative of his attitude towards the epidemic. In other words, since the issue is of little hedonic relevance to the perceiver, the amount of vested interest is low, and is therefore unlikely to produce attitude-consistent actions. Geographic distance and cultural differences are also a factor in attitude importance. Tragic circumstances halfway around the world or shocking behaviors by members of a culture different from the perceiver, will most likely never result in attitude change. The physical distance or cultural difference of an occurrence directly correlates to the vested interest of the perceiver. Things too far away or customs perceived to be too strange will almost never trigger a vested interest.

Indicators of vested interest can include attitude importance, as detailed by Jon Krosnick&lt;ref name="Krosnick"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krosnick |first1=J.A. |title=The Role of Attitude Importance in Social Evaluation: A Study of Policy Preferences, Presidential Candidate Evaluations, and Voting Behavior |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=1988 |volume=55 |issue=2 |page=196-198 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.55.2.196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who defined this concept by stating that “central, ego-involved, and salient attitudes” often include attitudes significantly important to individual interests.  In politics, for example, voters have a vested interest in candidates whose values (policy) align with their own to include attitudes toward these values.  Due to the nature of politics, voters come to conclusions about one candidate over another based on perceived attitude importance (object) on these policies rather than vocal support alone placing a high value on this concept as it pertains to vested interest. &lt;ref name="Krosnick" /&gt; 

Attitude object continuously makes an issue salient which correlates to outcome relevant involvement.  Two differences exist between vested interest and outcome relevant involvement where attitude objects remain highly important. &lt;ref name="Lehman &amp; Crano"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lehman |first1=B.J. |last2=Crano |first2=W. |title=The Pervasive Effect of Vested Interest on Attitude Consistency in Political Judgement |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |date=2002 |volume=38 |issue=2 |issn=0022-1031}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially,  outcome relevant objects retain a high degree of vested interest while not appearing to be.  Secondly,  outcome relevant involvement suggest interest ends once the goal is achieved whereas vested interest suggests a self-perpetuated interest. &lt;ref name="Lehman &amp; Crano"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lehman |first1=B.J. |last2=Crano |first2=W. |title=The Pervasive Effect of Vested Interest on Attitude Consistency in Political Judgement |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |date=2002 |volume=38 |issue=2 |issn=0022-1031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
There are five key components that may diminish or enhance the effects of vested interest on [[attitude-behavior consistency]]. These are (a) stake, (b) attitudinal salience, (c) the certainty of the attitude outcome link, (d) the immediacy of attitude-implicated consequences, and (e) the [[self-efficacy]] of the individual to perform an attitudinally implicated act. Attitudes affect behavior. However, social psychologists recognize that contextual, [[interpsychic]], and [[intrapsychic]] sources of variation can drastically affect the strength of this relation. A factor that has been shown to strongly affect attitude-behavior consistency is [[self-interest]] or vested interest.&lt;ref name="Brewer &amp; Crano 1994"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brewer |first1=M.B. |last2=Crano |first2=W.D. |title=Social psychology |date=1994 |publisher=West Pub. Co (West Group) |location=Minneapolis/St. Paul |isbn=0314028404 |edition=[1. Dr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following sections explain each of these variables in greater detail.

===Stake===
Stake refers to the perceived personal consequence of an attitude that is directly related to the intensity of vested interest and influences components that contribute to attitude-behavior consistency. In its basic form, the more that is at stake concerning a particular issue, the stronger the attitude will be. Consequently, as attitude strength increases, the consistency of attitude-based actions also increases.&lt;ref name="Crano"/&gt;

Referring to the concept of vested interest as it relates to attitude-behavior consistency, stake is an individual’s macro involvement in a particular situation where the consequence is salient&lt;ref name="Anker, Feeley, &amp; Kim"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anker |first1=A.E. |last2=Feeley |first2=T.H. |last3=Kim |first3=H. |title=Examining the Attitude-Behavior Relationship in Prosocial Donation Domains |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |date=2010 |volume=40 |issue=6 |issn=0021-9029}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In a situation where stake is operationalized using certainly and immediacy, one found the likely effect of this was behavior relative to the immediate consequence, positive or negative&lt;ref name="Anker, Feeley, &amp; Kim" /&gt;. For instance, in a study conducted to measure the relevance stake has on vested interest, students given a health assessment showed greater enthusiasm for items inquiring about donating blood when saving a life was salient (i.e. a child’s life depends on my donation)&lt;ref name="Anker, Feeley, &amp; Kim" /&gt;.

Stake may contribute to attitude-behavior consistency by inducing thoughts that support the attitude. This serves as the basis for future behavior. Stake may also strengthen the attitude-behavior relation by indirectly amplifying the awareness of stimuli associated with people's attitudes. Stake is the most powerful impression that comes from all the components of vested interest regarding attitude and behavior. Stake influences perceptions of attitude and action, but also of other action-relevant components as well. When stake is high, people also find the critical issue highly salient. Stake also affects the perception of immediacy. The greater the personal consequence of the issue, the more pressing the issue is perceived to be. Finally, stake was found to affect the perception of immediacy. The greater the personal consequence of the issue, the more pressing it was perceived to be. The phrases, "the stakes are/were high" or "high stakes", are used when issues of high salience or immediacy are raised, usually in regards to gambling or other high-risk activities involving vested interest.

===Salience===
[[social salience|Salience]] refers to the perceiver’s awareness of the effects of an attitude upon himself.&lt;ref name="Crano"/&gt; In other words, the prominence of an issue, as perceived by an individual, shapes the strength of his resulting attitude. Salient attitudes have a greater effect directly on subsequent behavior. Linking this discovery to vested interest, the research concluded that the salience effect was heightened when the attitude had important personal outcomes for someone. When the consequences of the behavior issuing from an attitude are highly salient, attitude-behavior consistency increases. If consequences are not salient, the consistency of the effects of vested interest on attitude behavior will be dramatically reduced. For instance, two people may have negative attitudes towards living near a prison. The first person lost a loved one at the hands of an inmate who escaped during a jailbreak. The second person simply does not like the eyesore the prison building creates in the area around his home. The first person's attitude towards inmates and prisons will probably be more salient than that of the second person who has not experienced a similar trauma. The first person's more salient attitude will foster the operation of vested interest, which will result in greater attitude-behavior consistency.

Attitudes that have been acquired through direct experience, such as the example just given, may be more salient than those acquired through vicarious processes. This greater salience results in greater consistency in attitude behavior. The attitude of someone who is non-salient reduces vested interest and weakens attitude-behavior consistency. The most powerful impression to emerge from all the analyses is the overwhelming effect of stake, or personal consequence, on attitude and behavior. When stake is high, people assume that a person would find the critical issue highly salient. Stake does not interact with, but enhances the perception of, issue salience. This is an important effect, because salience significantly affects actions that are expected to happen.

Additionally, salience can be described as the most recent and accessible memory associated with a specific object (i.e. idea) in which an individual has developed their own unique attitude&lt;ref name="Bradley &amp; Miller"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bradley |first1=A. |last2=Miller |first2=C. |title=Vested Interest: Developing Scales for Assessing Flooding Preparedness |journal=Disaster Prevention and Management |date=2016 |volume=25 |issue=3 |page=283-285 |issn=0965-3562}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Mortality, for instance, would become salient when faced with a situation where death was probable or the known death of a friend, relative or an experienced event which resulting in someone’s death.  This death salience would then influence behavior for a short amount of time following the event&lt;ref name="Pashak et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pashak |first1=T. |last2=Oswald |first2=S.R. |last3=Justice |first3=M.D. |last4=Seely |first4=L.T. |last5=Burns |first5=B.R. |last6=Sheperd |first6=S. |title=You are Alive Right Now: An Experimental Exploration of The Interplay Between Existential Salience, Mental Health, and Death Anxiety |journal=College Student Journal |date=2017 |volume=51 |issue=4 |page=452-453 |issn=0146-3934}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Certainty===
Certainty refers to perceived [[likelihood]] of personal consequences as a result of an attitude or action.&lt;ref name="Crano"/&gt; Simply stated, if a certain course of action is taken, then the chances of a specific event occurring as a result of this action are evaluated by the perceiver to help shape his resultant attitudes and behaviors. Certainty can be easily applied to situations in which an individual knowingly takes a calculated risk. For instance, let's continue with our aforementioned example of people living near a prison. Although the chance of a prison escape is minimal, particularly in a maximum-security prison, it could occur and crimes against those living close by would increase. Those living further away from the prison might argue that a prison break is unlikely and that there is no real risk. Alternatively, those living close to the prison could make an equally valid argument about the dangers of living near the prison in the event of prisoners escaping. Still others might realize there to be a potential risk to their safety, but would not deem it risky enough to move elsewhere.

Certainty in attitude, relative to vested interest, remains difficult to define without an understanding of two particular concepts.  One is the acceptance of truth in the events or idea requiring approximation of occurrence.  Two requires that certainty is not dependent on external factors which can undermine its validity. &lt;ref name="Bolyard"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bolyard |first1=C. |title=Truth and Certainty in Peter Auriol |journal=Vivarium |date=2015 |volume=53 |issue=1 |page=45-48 |issn=0042-7543}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certainty must be a concept which is pushed onto us much like truth is a certainty beyond our immediate control.&lt;ref name="Bolyard" /&gt; 

If the consequences of an attitude consistent act are uncertain, attitude-consistent action is not likely to occur, due to the fact that vested interest will be reduced. An example of this is a person who has a negative attitude towards living near a prison. If the person assumes that the link between living near a prison and being a victim of a violent crime is minimal, then health and safety promoting behaviors consistent with this negative attitude are not likely. However, if someone believes that living near the prison and being a victim of a violent crime is almost certain, that person would be unlikely to move close to the prison, assuming the person has a positive attitude toward safety or a negative attitude toward prisons and inmates.

===Immediacy===
Immediacy refers to an individual’s perceived amount of time between an action and its resulting consequences.&lt;ref name="Crano"/&gt; Immediacy can be considered an extension of certainty, however, these two entities are completely separate. For instance, in our prison example, people in opposition to the construction of the prison in their neighborhood may have felt that the amount of time to build the prison to and the eventual housing of prisoners was not long enough to make an informed decision. They may also feel that it is only a matter of time before something negative happened to the local citizens as a result of having a prison nearby.

Immediacy refers to the apparent temporary lag between an attitudinally implicated action and its consequences. If the results of an attitude consistent action are thought to be immediate rather than delayed, the effects of stake, or vested interest, on attitude-behavior consistency will be more dramatic. In other words, if a person living near the prison in the previous example perceives the possibility of a jailbreak could occur at a much later time in life, he may act in manner that is not consistent. This is because the lack of immediate consequences reduces the perception of vested interest. Therefore, immediacy can help explain self-destructive behaviors.

Immediacy, in vested interest,  can also be thought of in terms of positive or negative consequence disassociated from a timeline.  Vested interest such as organ donation, for example, make life and death salient which brings about the concept of immediacy to decide not necessarily to act.&lt;ref name="Siegel, et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Siegel |first1=Jason T. |last2=Alvaro |first2=Eusebio M. |last3=Lac |first3=Andrew |last4=Crano |first4=William D. |last5=Dominick |first5=Alexander |title=Intentions of Becoming a Living Organ Donor Among Hispanics: A Theory-Based Approach Exploring Differences Between Living and Nonliving Organ Donation |journal=Journal of Health Communication |date=8 February 2008 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=80–99 |doi=10.1080/10810730701807142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is seen in a mechanism which allows people to agree to donate organs in the event of their death (i.e. drivers licenses).&lt;ref name="Siegel, et al." /&gt; 

Another example of immediacy is that of marketing companies who implement immediacy to encourage consumers to act or remain inactive. If what they market is something a person is highly vested in and the marketing firm has simultaneously created an immediate need, then they have done their job to get consumers to behave as they desired. This use of immediacy can be both helpful and harmful. Consumers who are not well versed in how marketing works may find themselves situations they did not wish to be in. However, consumers who are cognizant of how marketing works may find this very useful in how they do or do not expend their resources.

===Self-efficacy===
[[Self-efficacy]] in regards to vested interest, is the amount that an individual believes that they are capable of performing an action associated with an attitude or advocated position.&lt;ref name="Crano"/&gt; In short, it is a person's sense of competence in regards to a specific task. Continuing with our prison example, residents with high vested interest that was covered by the other four components would need self-efficacy to protest the location of the new prison. In other words, the residents opposing the prison would have to believe in their abilities to effectively stop the construction. Conversely, if they lacked self-efficacy and therefore believed there was nothing they could do, then they would not act on their held attitude and vested interest will not have been attained. Variations in self-efficacy will produce differences in perceptions of the likelihood of someone working against the opposed plan. Higher levels of manipulated self-efficacy result in higher levels of expected action. However, variations in stake also influence perceptions of self-efficacy. When the stakes are high, people assume higher levels of perceived self-efficacy.

Another way the concept of self-efficacy can be described is using [[social cognitive theory]] to understand the role thought, drive and emotion have on self-efficacy (20).  Cognitively, one works to quantify actions, emotion, and drive resulting in self-efficacy.  However, this concept remains volatile as a change in one or more of these influences degrades self-efficacy.&lt;ref name="Pattanaik &amp; Sia"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pattanaik |first1=S. |last2=Sia |first2=N. |title=Self-Efficacy, Political Efficacy and Political Orientation |journal=Indian Journal of Health and Wellbeing |date=2015 |volume=6 |issue=2 |page=222-225 |issn=2229-5356}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this would be physical fitness, in that, elevated or decreased self-efficacy will cause one to accept or deny a strenuous task daily.&lt;ref name="Pattanaik &amp; Sia" /&gt;

==Relevant research==
===Drinking age experiment===
Various studies have been conducted to determine the effects of vested interest on attitude strengths. In one such study, Crano and Sivacek&lt;ref name="S&amp;C"/&gt; visited a university in Michigan and gathered the results of a proposed drinking-age referendum. The referendum sought to increase the legal drinking age from 18 to 21. The respondents were divided into three categories: 1. high vested interest (those who would be significantly and immediately affected as a result of the referendum), 2. low vested interest (those who would be unaffected by the law change at the time of its inception), and 3. moderate vested interest (those who fell between the first two extremes). Although 80% of the subjects were opposed to the referendum, their respective levels of vested interest clearly indicated that the strength of their attitudes significantly affected their resultant behaviors. Half of the highly vested interest groups joined the anti-referendum campaign, but only a quarter of the moderately vested interest group and an eighth of the low vested interest group joined the campaign.&lt;ref name="S&amp;C"/&gt; These results support Crano's theory of vested interest and reinforce the implications and considerations of stake, salience, certainty, immediacy, and self-efficacy discussed above. It also proves the correlation between vested interest and action, based on what level of involvement the three types of students were willing to participate in.

===Comprehensive exam experiment===
In a second study, Sivacek and Crano&lt;ref name="S&amp;C"/&gt; visited [[Michigan State University]]. In this experiment, subjects were informed that the university was considering the addition of a senior comprehensive examination to the graduate prerequisites. Respondents were given the following options:
#Do nothing
#Sign an opposing petition
#Join a group that opposed the referendum
#Volunteer specific numbers of hours to the opposing group's activities
The respondents were grouped into the same three categories as the drinking age study: high, moderate, and low vested interest. The study found that those with the highest levels of vested interest were significantly more inclined to take action based on their attitudes concerning the issue; that is, their resultant behaviors (signing the petition, joining the group, pledging multiple hours with the group) occurred much more consistently and prevalently than that of the other two vested interest groups.&lt;ref name="S&amp;C"/&gt;

===Assumed consensus===
Crano conducted another study to prove that vested interest may affect people's belief that a majority of a population will support their attitude on an issue. This bias is known as [[False consensus effect|false-consensus]] or assumed-consensus effect. Under the guise of a public opinion survey, Crano&lt;ref name="Crano83"&gt;Crano, W. D. (1983). Assumed consensus of attitudes: the effect of vested interest. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 9, 597-608&lt;/ref&gt; created high and low vested interest groups by identifying whether upper- or lower-classmen would pay a surcharge to subsidize lost funding from the government. The class who was selected to pay the surcharge had a high degree of vested interest while the student body not required to pay exhibited a lower degree of vested interest. The study then determined the participants estimate of what percentage of the student body would support their beliefs regardless of impact. Crano found that vested interest influenced assumed consensus and students believed that a majority of the university's population would support their plight even though only half would be affected.&lt;ref name="Crano"/&gt;

===The effect of smoking on attitudes toward cigarette tax and smoking restrictions===
Dale Miller and Rebecca Ratner&lt;ref name="M&amp;R"&gt;Miller, D., &amp; Ratner, R. (1998). The Disparity Between the Actual and Assumed Power of Self-Interest. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74, 1, 53-62&lt;/ref&gt; conducted this study utilizing 81 male and female students at the University of Yale. In this experiment the objective was for half of the participants to show their own attitude toward smoking policies and the other half to show their thoughts on others attitudes toward smoking policies. The group with the questionnaire regarding their personal attitude about smoking were asked: 1. if they were a smoker or a nonsmoker, 2. how heavy or light a smoker they were, 3. whether they would support an increase on cigarette tax, 4. would they do away with smoking advertisements, and 5. their thoughts on smoking restrictions in public places. The second half of the participants were asked what percentage they thought smokers would support the previously mentioned policies for smokers or nonsmokers. They were not asked whether or not they smoked. The results of this study replicated Green and Gerkin's 1989 study&lt;ref&gt;Green, D., &amp; Gerken, A. (1989). Self-interest and public opinion toward smoking restrictions and cigarette taxes. Public Opinion Quarterly, 53, 1-16&lt;/ref&gt; that nonsmokers had more support for smoking restrictions than did those that smoke.&lt;ref name="M&amp;R"/&gt; These results supported the hypothesis: "Smokers in this study were more opposed to policies that regulated smoking than were nonsmokers, but the effect of smoking status on expressed attitudes was significantly less than that predicted by respondents".&lt;ref name="M&amp;R"/&gt; The smokers had a higher vested interest in smoking policies because they were directly affected. This study also revealed a direct correlation between vested interest and attitudes.&lt;ref name="M&amp;R"/&gt;

===Voter Registration===
Barbara Lehman and William Crano conducted a study regarding the persuasive effects of vested interest on attitude concerning political judgment which was published in 2001. &lt;ref name="Lehman &amp; Crano" /&gt; In this study, they utilized data from 1976 national election studies concentrating on three areas (e.g. living conditions, health insurance and school integration).  Their discoveries were such that self-interest was a significant contributor to values placed on all three areas of concern. &lt;ref name="Lehman &amp; Crano" /&gt; Further, outside analysis of the study revealed self-interest had a direct correlation to ideologies, affiliation, and intolerance.  Additionally, respondents with vested interest in any one of the three areas were more than likely to endorse candidates whose focus was in that particular area. &lt;ref name="Lehman &amp; Crano" /&gt;

	These findings, set in 1976, show a significant relationship between vested interest and aligned values associated with electoral candidates which can be either perceived or marketed.  Understanding these values, one can conclude, would allow for use of vested interest harvested by surveys to decide which values to champion for use in maximizing voter endorsement. &lt;ref name="Lehman &amp; Crano" /&gt;

==Issues==
Vested interest appears to affect people's tendency to overestimate the extent to which others agree with their beliefs, a bias known variously as the false-consensus or assumed-consensus effect.&lt;ref name="Crano83" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marks &amp; Miller"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marks |first1=Gary |last2=Miller |first2=Norman |title=Ten years of research on the false-consensus effect: An empirical and theoretical review. |journal=Psychological Bulletin |date=1987 |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=72–90 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.102.1.72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross, Greene &amp; House"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ross |first1=Lee |last2=Greene |first2=David |last3=House |first3=Pamela |title=The “false consensus effect”: An egocentric bias in social perception and attribution processes |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |date=May 1977 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=279–301 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(77)90049-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;If people tend to overestimate the number of others who share their beliefs, this tendency should be exacerbated in situations involving personally consequential, or highly vested, beliefs. Research supports this expectation.&lt;ref name="Crano83"/&gt; College student participants who thought that a new university policy would disadvantage them personally assumed that the great majority of the student body would evaluate the policy as they had, despite the fact that only half the student population would be similarly disadvantaged.

==Summary==
Each of the five components (stake, salience, certainty, immediacy, and self-efficacy) co-exist within an individual’s realm of conscious judgment. If it creates a sufficiently strong attitude, any of these components can cause an individual to adopt or reject a certain position. All five are considered any time an individual is presented with a message that attempts to influence or persuade him to adopt a certain position or perform an action. The process of evaluating these components can range from almost instantly to taking several years. At any rate, all five are considered (consciously or subconsciously) before making a decision with implications of vested interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5220">'''Visual control''' is a [[business management]] technique employed in many places where information is communicated by using visual signals instead of texts or other written instructions. The design is deliberate in allowing quick recognition of the information being communicated,  in order to increase efficiency and clarity. These signals can be of many forms, from different coloured clothing for different teams, to focusing measures upon the size of the problem and not the size of the activity, to [[kanban]], [[obeya]] and [[heijunka box]]es and many other diverse examples. In [[The Toyota Way]], it is also known as ''mieruka''.

== Purpose ==
Visual control methods aim to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of a process by making the steps in that process more visible. The theory behind visual control is that if something is clearly visible or in plain sight, it is easy to remember and keep at the forefront of the mind. Another aspect of visual control is that everyone is given the same visual cues and so are likely to have the same vantage point.

There are many different techniques that are used to apply visual control in the workplace. Some companies use visual control as an organizational tool for materials. A clearly labeled storage board lets the employee know exactly where a tool belongs and what tools are missing from the display board. Another simple example of a common visual control is to have reminders posted on cubicle walls so that they remain in plain sight. Visual signs and signals communicate information that is needed to make effective decisions. These decisions may be safety oriented or they may give reminders as to what steps should be taken to resolve a problem. Most companies use visual controls in one degree or another, many of them not even realizing that the visual controls that they are making have a name and a function in the workplace. Whether it is recognized by the name of "visual control" or not, the fact is that replacing text or number with graphics makes a set of information easier to understand with only a glance, making it a more efficient way of communicating a message. It is also commonly used for internal team communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindlof|first1=Ludvig|last2=Soderberg|first2=Bjorn|title=Pros and cons of lean visual planning: experiences from four product development organisations|journal=International Journal of Technology Intelligence and Planning|date=2011|volume=7|issue=3|pages=269–279|doi=10.1504/IJTIP.2011.044614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual controls are designed to make the control and management of a company as simple as possible. This entails making problems, abnormalities, or deviations from standards visible to everyone. When these deviations are visible and apparent to all, corrective action can be taken to immediately correct these problems.

Visual controls are meant to display the operating or progress status of a given operation in an easy to see format and also to provide instruction and to convey information. A visual control system must have an action component associated with it in the event that the visually represented procedures are not being followed in the real production process. Therefore, visual controls must also have a component where immediate feedback is provided to workers.

== Types ==
There are two groups and seven types of application in visual controls. Displays group and controls group. 
* A visual display group relates information and data to employees in the area. For example, charts showing the monthly revenues of the company or a graphic depicting a certain type of quality issue that group members should be aware of. Large scale, (typically 2x4m) examples of this are known as communications boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bateman|first1=Nicola|last2=Philp|first2=Lee|last3=Warrender|first3=Harry|date=2016|title=Visual management and shop floor teams–development, implementation and use.|journal=International Journal of Production Research|issue=54(24),|pages=7345–7358.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication boards are large enough to contain several displays and allow teams of people to view at once.  This supports team decision making and promotes a "shared vision".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22488262|title=The visual factory : building participation through shared information|last=Michel.|first=Greif,|date=1991|publisher=Productivity Press|isbn=0915299674|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=22488262}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A visual control group is intended to actually control or guide the action of the group members. Examples of controls are readily apparent in society: stop signs, handicap parking signs, no smoking signs, etc.

'''Wikitorial''' is a term coined by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' to describe a traditional [[editorial]] that can be edited in the fashion of a [[wiki]] (computer software that allows users to edit text and make changes to one document). On June 17, 2005 the ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote the first Wikitorial, entitled ''War and Consequences'', on the subject of the [[War in Iraq]]. Below that editorial the paper wrote an invitation to its readers to rewrite the editorial in the wiki fashion. They called the experiment a "public [[Development stage#Beta|beta]]" and suggested that it might be either a failure or a new form of [[opinion journalism]].

[[Jimmy Wales]], head of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], which governs Wikipedia, was one of the early contributors to the new Wikitorial which inspired a counterpoint editorial, redirections and much discussion.

==Closing==
The ''L.A. Times'' Wikitorial was closed on June 19, 2005. This was due to a [[Vandalism|vandal]] inserting multiple pictures of [[Goatse.cx|goatse]].&lt;ref&gt;Glaister, Dan. "[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/jun/22/media.pressandpublishing LA Times 'wikitorial' gives editors red faces]." ''[[The Guardian]]''. Wednesday JUNE 22, 2005. Retrieved on December 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 4:30 AM local time the vandal was changing the site to [[pornographic]] photos and just as quickly, within seconds, a guardian was reverting it to the earlier editorial. Shortly after 5:00 AM the connection was broken and the Wikitorial ceased to be available.

Readers who access the site find this message:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''''Where is the wikitorial?'''''

''Unfortunately, we have had to remove this feature, at least temporarily, because a few readers were flooding the site with inappropriate material.''

''Thanks and apologies to the thousands of people who logged on in the right spirit.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the two days the Wikitorial was available it had changed from the original length (just under eleven hundred words) to just over twenty-seven hundred words. Several experienced Wikipedians offered suggestions for the organization of the Wikitorial.

==Wikitorial II==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}&lt;!--Does the paper compare this feature to Wikitorial?--&gt;
[[South Dakota]]'s ''[[Argus Leader]]'' has inaugurated a new online feature called You Re-Write-It Editorials. It follows the Wikitorial pattern with the main difference from the ''Los Angeles Times'' experiment being that the moderators will check the editorials before posting them to avoid the problems experienced by the ''Los Angeles Times''.
