She moved to the United States in 2001 to further her education, earning a [[Ph.D]] from [[Michigan State University]], East Lansing, Michigan in 2007. 

Adejoke was a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Nurse Faculty Scholar at the [[Calvin College]] Department of Nursing (CCDON) in Grand Rapids, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calvin College nursing professor wins $350,000 to educate low-income women about unplanned pregnancy|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2012/08/calvin_college_nursing_profess.html|publisher=Mlive Media|location=Michigan|author=Brian McVicar|date=August 29, 2012|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nursefacultyscholars.org/scholars/scholar-detail/adejoke-ayoola|title=Ayoola Adejoke|website=Nursefacultyscholars|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nursing research==
Ajoke's work with low-income women from diverse ethnic backgrounds in Grand Rapids was published in the ''[[Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health]]'' in July 2013. She was also the major contributor in a study published in the ''[[American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology]]'' in 2009 examining the relationship between the time of recognition of pregnancy and birth outcomes, such as premature births, low birth weight, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, and infant mortality. Her research focuses on promoting women and adolescent reproductive health with the primary aim of reducing poor maternal and child health outcomes. Her research on aspects of reproductive health knowledge and pregnancy planning regarding three residential, ethnically diverse low-income communities were the partnering neighborhoods with CCDON program. The goal of the project was to reduce the risk of unplanned pregnancy and promote early recognition of pregnancy. Her research illustrates the importance of nursing research and the research generation's relevance to sustaining effective nursing practice, especially within the constantly changing American health care system.
Adejoke is a member of the Midwest Nursing Research Society (MNRS) and the CCDON Vice President for [[Sigma Theta Tau]] International Honor Society of Nursing, Kappa Epsilon-at-Large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01849900|website=Clinical Trials|title=Preconception Reproductive Knowledge Promotion (PREKNOP)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Professors and Administrators|url=http://www.cnaclasses.org/top-professors-and-administrators/nursing/|website=CNA|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congress.nursingsociety.org/documents/feede342.2014_congress_program.pdf|website=25th International Nursing Research Program|title=Congress Program|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378%2809%2900505-5/references|website=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|title=Adejoke Ayoola|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''And Then I Go'' made its worldwide premiere at the 2017 [[Los Angeles Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hipes|first=Patrick|title=Los Angeles Film Festival Unveils 2017 Lineup|date=9 May 2017|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|url=http://deadline.com/2017/05/los-angeles-film-festival-2017-lineup-movie-list-1202087690/|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was picked up for distribution by [[The Orchard (company)|The Orchard]], and was released theatrically as well as on VOD and Digital HD on April 17, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boone|first1=John|title=Melanie Lynskey and Justin Long Are Parents to a Bullied Teen in 'And Then I Go' Trailer (Exclusive)|url=http://www.etonline.com/melanie-lynskey-and-justin-long-are-parents-to-a-bullied-teen-in-and-then-i-go-trailer-exclusive|website=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|publisher=[[CBS Television Distribution]]|accessdate=17 April 2018|date=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 91%, based on 11 reviews, and a MetaCritic score of 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/and_then_i_go |title=And Then I Go (2018) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has received almost unanimous critical acclaim with Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter calling it, "A powerful portrait of teen alienation."  Further stating, "A disturbing drama of teen disaffection, Vincent Grashaw's feature provides an essential and insightful perspective that will resonate with audiences attuned to the challenges of adolescence."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/and-then-i-go-1015668&lt;/ref&gt;

Forbes goes on to call the film "an uncommonly poignant treatment of adolescence, darker but not entirely dissimilar from Richard Linklater's 2014 masterpiece, Boyhood, irrespective of where this particular story leads." Further stating, "And Then I Go is less a film about school shootings than one about the crushingly real struggles of youth, struggles that adults quickly forget or make light of, which often just exacerbates the problem. That such difficulties can lead, increasingly, to equally real tragic ends should give any parent or educator pause. We may not be able to stop school shootings once and for all, but recognizing that each one is unique, and likely the product of something far more commonplace than mental illness, might be a place to start."

Entertainment Weekly garnered the film with a 'B+' rating and listed as a 'Must See'.  Leah Greenblatt commenting, "What Grashaw does remarkably well, in the movie's harrowing final minutes, is put us entirely inside Edwin's head; not as a sociopath or a killer, just a boy in a world of pain." &lt;ref&gt;http://ew.com/movies/2018/04/17/and-then-i-go-review/?utm&lt;/ref&gt;

In Michael Nordine's positive IndieWire review of the film declares, "We need to talk about this disturbing coming-of-age drama." calling it, "an intimate, sympathetic character study." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiewire.com/2017/06/and-then-i-go-review-vincent-grashaw-laff-1201845476/&lt;/ref&gt;

Bob Strauss with the LA Daily News stated the film is "a deep, lived-in study of bullied middle school kids who plan to solve their problems in the worst possible way." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailynews.com/2017/06/15/what-to-see-at-the-la-film-festival-today-and-then-i-go-june-16-2017/&lt;/ref&gt;

We Live Entertainment begins it's review with, "'And Then I Go' is one of the most uncomfortably realistic films I've ever seen, which is also one of my highest compliments." &lt;ref&gt;http://weliveentertainment.com/welivefilm/la-film-festival-go/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5458">'''Beta Phi Mu''' (also '''ΒΦΜ''' or '''βφμ''') is the international [[honor society]] for [[library science|library &amp; information science]] and [[information technology]].  Founded by a group of librarians and library educators, the society's express purpose is to recognize and encourage "superior academic achievement" among library and information studies students. Beta Phi Mu now has 39 active chapters in the U.S. and abroad, continues to sponsor various publications and funds several scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betaphimu.org/scholarships/|title = Beta Phi Mu: Scholarships, Fellowships, &amp; Awards|publisher = Beta Phi Mu|accessdate = 7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society's name comes from the initials in the Greek phrase ''"Bibliothekarios philax mathesis''," meaning "the librarian is the guardian of knowledge."

'''College Possible''' (formerly "Admission Possible") is a [[nonprofit]] [[AmeriCorps]] organization making college admission and success possible for low-income students in the United States through an intensive curriculum of coaching and support. Its model uses recent college graduates serving an [[AmeriCorps]] term of service as near-peer mentors for students lacking the social resources to successfully enroll in and graduate from college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admissionpossible.org/americorps.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215145807/http://www.admissionpossible.org/americorps.html |archivedate=2011-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Headquartered in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], the organization serves students in all 50 states with offices located in the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]] metro area, [[Chicago]], [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee,]] [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]].

==History==
College Possible was chartered as a nonprofit in September 2000, beginning operations in two Twin Cities public high schools the next spring. By the 2008-09 school year, the organization was serving students in seventeen high school schools across Minneapolis-Saint Paul and launched a second site in Milwaukee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admissionpossible.org/history.html Admission Possible history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109162012/http://www.admissionpossible.org/history.html |date=2010-11-09 }}, accessed 10.28.10&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 2015, College Possible launched a sixth site in Chicago, Illinois. In 2016, College Possible launched Catalyze, a program to embed their coaching model and curriculum on campus with partner colleges and universities. In the 2017-18 school year, College Possible served more than 22,000 students at hundreds of high schools, colleges and universities across the country.

==Programming==
A ''New York Times'' article from November 2005 quotes CEO Jim McCorkell as saying: "My starting idea was what if we replicated Kaplan for poor kids."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/16/education/16education.html ''Test Prep Help for Those Too Poor to Afford Kaplan''], New York Times, November 16, 2005, accessed 10.28.10&lt;/ref&gt; To be eligible for College Possible's free services, students must come from low-income families and have a GPA of 2.0 or higher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/local/north/42474282.html?page=1&amp;c=y ''A stairway to higher education''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013174459/http://www.startribune.com/local/north/42474282.html?page=1&amp;c=y |date=2012-10-13 }}, Star Tribune, Minneapolis, April 7, 2009, accessed 11.02.10&lt;/ref&gt; High school students accepted into the program participate in after-school sessions over their junior and senior years, with time divided between test preparation, college applications, financial aid applications and preparing to transition to college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/local/94634709.html?page=1&amp;c=y ''Admission Possible shows the way for college aspirants''], Star Tribune, Minneapolis, May 24, 2010, accessed 11.02.10&lt;/ref&gt; The program also has a service component, including an annual service event on [[Make a Difference Day]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://insightnews.com/education/5161-admission-possible-students-scare-up-10000-pound-donation-for-foodshelf- ''Students scare up 10,000 pound donation for foodshelf''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713043752/http://insightnews.com/education/5161-admission-possible-students-scare-up-10000-pound-donation-for-foodshelf- |date=2011-07-13 }}, InsightNews.com, Minneapolis, November 5, 2009, accessed 11.02.10&lt;/ref&gt;

College students receive guidance in finding and accessing campus resources, renewing the [[FAFSA]], locating internships, maintaining a healthy balance between homework and social obligations, as well as when transferring schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admissionpossible.org/collegeprogram.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216180432/http://www.admissionpossible.org/collegeprogram.html |archivedate=2011-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

College Possible is a partner organization with the [[Bloomberg Philanthropies]] funded CollegePoint program, which is a virtual advising program designed to help high-achieving, low-income students gain admission to top colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/06/19/605213056/how-virtual-advisers-help-low-income-students-apply-to-college|title=Free College Advisers Make A Hard Decision Less Lonely|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.org/program/education/collegeaccess/|title=College Access and Success {{!}} Bloomberg Philanthropies|work=Bloomberg Philanthropies|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation==
College Possible is a 501(c)3 organization that has received a four-star rating from [[Charity Navigator]] for financial management and a three-star rating for accountability and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=11838&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 Harvard study determined that Admission Possible more than doubles the chances a low-income student will enroll in a four-year institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admissionpossible.org/uploads/harvard_comparative_historical_analysis_results_-_june_201.pdf "Comparative Historical Analysis Admission Possible 2007-2009 Harvard Kennedy School June 2011"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A later 2013 Harvard study found College Possible to have a significant positive impact on four-year college enrollment, though it had no statistically significant effect on ACT scores.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/10/29/study-tracks-impact-counseling-low-income-students#sthash.UvPYCYmZ.dpbs&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilder Research, an arm of the [[Amherst H. Wilder Foundation]], performed an evaluation of Admission Possible in 2006, substantiating its claim that 91% of the organization's students enrolled in college, and that it compared favorably to similar programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilder.org/reportsummary.0.html?&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=31&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1899&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=357&amp;cHash=597b4fda40 Admission Possible evaluation results], Laura McLain (2006), Wilder Research&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charities Review Council deems that it "meets all standards".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartgivers.org/charity_search_2.html?EIN=411968798 Admission Possible profile] on Charities Review Council website&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] mentioned the organization in a speech on [[social entrepreneurship]] saying: "Admission Possible operates in just two states now. So imagine if it were 10 or 20 or 50."&lt;ref&gt;[http://philanthropy.com/article/AmeriCorpsa-Nod-from/57783/ ''AmeriCorps and a Nod from Obama Give College-Access Group a Lift''], The Chronicle of Philanthropy, October 15, 2009, accessed 11.02.10&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, College Possible was invited to be part of a White House summit on college opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collegepossible.org/news/from-white-house-summit-college-possible-announces-philadelphia-launch/&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October of 2018, College Possible was the first recipient of the $125,000 Evergreen National Education Prize, awarded by the [[Greenwald Family Foundation]] to programs that "best help low-income youth access access and compete college or vocational degrees."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.twincities.com/2018/10/16/st-paul-based-college-possible-wins-125000-prize/|title=St. Paul-based College Possible wins $125,000 prize|date=2018-10-16|work=Twin Cities|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Dekirukana'''''|できるかな}} was an educational children's television show produced by [[NHK]] between 1967 and 1990.

The show consisted of 15-minute episodes centered on crafts, mainly using paper. It showed kids how to use [[scissors]] and [[adhesive tape]]. The protagonists were {{nihongo|Noppo|ノッポさん|Noppo-san}}, played by [[Ei Takami]], and the anthropomorphic gopher, {{nihongo|Gonta|ゴン太くん|Gonta-kun}}.

''Dekirukana'' was broadcast during the 1980s and 1990s with great success in many state-run networks in [[Latin America]], to whom NHK donated the programme, along with other educational shows. In these countries the name of the show was translated as ''¿Puedo hacerlo yo?'' ("Can I do it?"), but it is informally known as ''Nopo y Gonta'', after the main characters.

This program was also broadcast by [[Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation|Rupavahini]] in [[Sri Lanka]] and in mid-1990s in [[TVP1]].

'''Edward Alexander Bouchet''' (September 15, 1852 – October 28, 1918) was an [[African Americans|African American]] [[physicist]] and educator and was the first African-American to earn a [[Ph.D.]] from any American university, completing his [[dissertation]] in [[physics]] at [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1876. On the basis of his academic record he was elected to the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]].  In 1874, he had become one of the first African Americans to graduate from Yale College.{{efn|He was long thought to have been the first African-American graduate of Yale College, but investigations made public in 2014 suggest that that distinction actually belongs to Richard Henry Green, who was awarded his bachelor of arts degree in 1857,&lt;ref name =NYT&gt;{{Citation | last = Kaminer | first = Ariel | title = Discovery Leads Yale to Revise a Chapter of Its Black History | newspaper = The New York Times | publication-place = New York, New York | volume = | issue = | date = February 28, 2014 | page = | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/01/nyregion/discovery-leads-yale-to-revise-a-chapter-of-its-black-history.html?hp }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =YAM&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Bass | first1 = Carole | last2 = Branch | first2 = Mark Alden | title = Yale College's first black grad: it's not who you think | magazine = Yale Alumni Magazine | publication-place = New Haven, Connecticut | volume = LXXVII| issue = 4 | date = March 2014  | page = | url = http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/blog_posts/1719 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly to Randall Lee Gibson or Moses Simons.&lt;ref name =YAM2&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Branch | first1 = Mark Alden | title = Before Green and Bouchet, another African American Yale College Grad.

Although Bouchet was elected to Phi Beta Kappa along with other members of the Yale class of 1874, the official induction did not take place until 1884, when the Yale chapter was reorganized after thirteen years of inactivity. Because of the circumstances, Bouchet was not the first African American elected to Phi Beta Kappa as many historical accounts state; that honor belongs to George Washington Henderson (University of Vermont).
Bouchet was also among the first 20 Americans (of any race) to receive a Ph.D. in physics and was the sixth to earn a Ph.D. in physics from [[Yale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebasi.org/biobouchet.html Biography of Dr. Edward A. Bouchet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/physics/bouchet_edward_alexander.html Physicists of the African Diaspora]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Edward Bouchet was born at home in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], to parents William and Susan (Cooley) Bouchet. At that time, there were only three schools in New Haven open to black children. Bouchet was enrolled in the Artisan Street Colored School with only one teacher, who nurtured Bouchet's academic abilities. He attended the New Haven High School from 1866 to 1868 and then [[Hopkins School]] from 1868 to 1870, where he was named [[valedictorian]] (after graduating first in his class).&lt;ref name="bio1"&gt;[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/physics/bouchet_edward_alexander.html Edward Alexander Bouchet Bio]&lt;/ref&gt;
He ranked sixth in his class on graduation from Yale.&lt;ref name=YaleObit&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | year = 1918 | title = Bulletin of Yale University: Obituary Record of Yale Graduates | publisher = Yale University | publication-place = New Haven, Connecticut | pages = 919–20 | url = http://mssa.library.yale.edu/obituary_record/1859_1924/1918-19.pdf | accessdate = 4 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional life==
Bouchet was unable to find a university teaching position after college, probably because of [[racial discrimination]]. Bouchet moved to Philadelphia in 1876 and took a position at the [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia's]] Institute for Colored Youth (now [[Cheyney University of Pennsylvania]]), where he taught [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] for the next 26 years.&lt;ref name="bio1"/&gt;{{efn|The Institute for Colored Youth was later renamed [[Cheyney University]].}} He resigned in 1902 at the height of the [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]-[[Booker T. Washington]] controversy over the need for an industrial vs. collegiate education for blacks.

Bouchet spent the next 14 years holding a variety of jobs around the country. Between 1905 and 1908, Bouchet was director of academics at St. Paul's Normal and Industrial School in Lawrenceville, Virginia (presently, [[Saint Paul's College, Virginia|St. Paul's College]]). He was then principal and teacher at Lincoln High School in [[Gallipolis, Ohio]] from 1908 to 1913.  He joined the faculty of [[Bishop College]] in Marshall, Texas in 1913.  Illness finally forced him to retire in 1916 and he moved back to New Haven. He died there, in his childhood home, in 1918, at age of 66. He had never married and had no children. He was a Republican.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lincoln Mather, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tWTXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=edward+alexander+bouchet+frank+lincoln+mather&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZcA-U_KcF6LCyQGk2YGoCA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=edward%20alexander%20bouchet%20frank%20lincoln%20mather&amp;f=false "Who's who of the Colored Race"], 1915&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizaveta Pavlovna Gerdt''' ({{Lang-ru|Елизавета Павловна Гердт}}; {{OldStyleDate|29 January|1891|17 January}} &amp;ndash; 6 November 1975) was a Russian dancer and teacher whose career links the Russian imperial and Soviet schools of classical dance.

A daughter of celebrated dancer [[Paul Gerdt]], she studied under [[Michel Fokine]] at the [[Imperial Ballet School]], where her chief partner was [[Vaslav Nijinsky]]. She married another popular danseur, [[Samuil Adrianov]] (1884-1917; the first husband), who danced with [[Pierina Legnani]] and [[Mathilde Kschessinska]], two ballerinas she sought to emulate.

After the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] Elizaveta Gerdt and [[Olga Spesivtseva]] were the only world-class dancers who chose to remain in Russia, while others emigrated to the West. 

In 1928, after 20 years of dancing, she resolved to abandon the stage and devote herself to teaching. She taught the class of perfection for the female dancers in the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Leningrad Opera and Ballet Theatre]] together with teaching the girls in her [[Vaganova Ballet Academy|Alma mater]] (1927-1934). Then she moved from Leningrad to Moscow. There she taught the class for the female dancers at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]], coaching [[ballerina]]s of the [[Bolshoi Ballet]] and also worked at the [[Moscow State Academy of Choreography|Moscow Ballet School]] (1935-1942 and 1945-1960).

Among her students were [[Alla Shelest]] (in Leningrad), [[Irina Tikhomirnova]], [[Maya Plisetskaya]], [[Violetta Bovt]], [[Mira Redina]], [[Raisa Struchkova]], [[Ekaterina Maksimova]] (in Moscow). With some of them she continued to collaborate at the theatre. Thus she coached [[Sulamith Messerer]] and later her niece [[Maya Plisetskaya]].

'''Future City Competition''' is a national competition in the United States that focuses on improving students' math, engineering, and science skills. The program is open to students in the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades who attend a public, private or home school.

The Future City Competition is an example of problem-based learning with computer simulation, in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, &amp; Mathematics) education. The program asks 6th, 7th and 8th grade students from around the nation to team with engineer-volunteer mentors to create – first on computer and then in three-dimensional models – their visions of the city of tomorrow. A program of the DiscoverE organization, it has been operating since 1992 and currently serves over 40,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;http://futurecity.org/page/our-impact&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The aim of the Future City Competition is to provide an exciting educational engineering program for sixth, seventh and eighth grade students that combines a stimulating engineering challenge with an inquiry-based application to present their vision of a city of the future.

==Benefits==         
The Future City Competition provides a platform for students to increase their:
* Ability to work in teams,
* Research and technical writing,
* Oral presentation skills,
* Application of coursework to practical problems,
* An awareness of community and business issues on the local and global levels.

==National Academic Content Standards==
The Future City Competition components are strongly aligned with many national educational standards relating to STEM fields.

==State Academic Content Standards==
State Academic Standards are based on the National Academic Standards. 
*Two levels: regional competitions and the national finals for the winners of the previous contests. The goal is to design a futuristic city and discuss its important elements: [[urban planning]], [[zoning]], [[transportation]], [[energy]], [[economy]], [[Natural environment|environment]], and [[education]].

Team members represent their ideas and proposals in several ways:
*Essay about the yearly theme (for example, the theme of the 2016–17 competition is the "Power of Public Space" where students are challenged to design a Future City that includes a distributed network of innovative, multi-use public spaces that serves their city's diverse population).&lt;ref&gt;http://futurecity.org/resource/2016-2017-program-handbook&lt;/ref&gt;
*A City Narrative discussing their city's attributes, features, and main concepts.
*A Physical Model to show a physical representation of their city. The model is to consist of as many recycled materials as possible, and must cost less than 100 dollars.
*Computer Design using [[Sim City]] software.
*Presentation to describe their city to the judges on the day of the competition.

== Awards and prizes ==
Teams that win their Regional Competitions advance to the National Finals. Teams competing at the National Finals have the opportunity to win the following prizes:
*1st Place: A trip to Space Camp and $7,500 from [[Bentley Systems]]
*2nd Place: $5,000 from the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]]
*3rd Place: $2,000 from [[IEEE]]-USA
*4th Place: $750 from [[Ohio University]]
*5th Place: $750 from the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5688">[[File:International Network of Geoparks map.jpg|thumb|World locator map for geoparks included in the [[UNESCO]] [[Global Geoparks Network]] (GGN) as of 2008]]
A '''geopark''' is a unified area that advances the protection and use of geological heritage in a sustainable way, and promotes the economic well-being of the people who live there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nikolas_Zouros/publication/258100065_Geoparks_Celebrating_earth_heritage_sustaining_local_communities/links/0deec5272cb8fee05e000000.pdf Patrick J. Mc Keever and Nickolas Zouros (2005). Geoparks: Celebrating earth heritage, sustaining local communities. EPISODES, December 2005, pp. 274–278.]&lt;/ref&gt; There are global geoparks and national geoparks.

==Concepts==
A UNESCO definition of ''global geopark'' is a unified area with a geological heritage of international significance.&lt;ref name="globalgeopark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/earth-sciences/global-geoparks/some-questions-about-geoparks/what-is-a-global-geopark/ |title=What is a Global Geopark? &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geoparks use that heritage to promote awareness of key issues facing society in the context of our dynamic planet. Many geoparks promote awareness of geological [[hazard]]s, including [[volcano]]es, [[earthquake]]s and [[tsunami]]s and many help prepare [[disaster]] mitigation strategies with [[Local community|local communities]]. Geoparks embody records of past climate changes and are indicators of current [[climate change]]s as well as demonstrating a "best practise" approach to using renewable energy and employing the best standards of "[[green tourism]]". [[Tourism]] industry promotion in geoparks, as a geographically sustainable and applicable tourism model, aims to sustain, and even enhance, the geographical character of a place.

Geoparks also inform about the sustainable use and need for [[natural resource]]s, whether they are mined, quarried or harnessed from the surrounding [[Natural environment|environment]] while at the same time promoting respect for the environment and the integrity of the [[landscape]]. Geoparks are not a legislative designation though the key heritage sites within a geopark are often protected under local, regional or national legislation.&lt;ref name="globalgeopark" /&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of the concept of geopark and tourism promotion in geoparks differentiates itself from other models of [[sustainable tourism]]. In fact, sustainable tourism promotion within geoparks encompasses many of the features of sustainable tourism including geo-tourism (geo-site tourism: as a basic factor), community-based tourism and integrated rural tourism (as a vital need), [[ecotourism]], and [[cultural heritage]] tourism.

==Global Network and UNESCO==
The [[Global Geoparks Network]] (GGN) is supported by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO). Many national geoparks and other local geoparks projects also exist which are not included in the Global Geoparks Network.

The geoparks initiative was launched by UNESCO in response to the perceived need for an international initiative that recognizes sites representing an [[earth science]] interest.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About—UNESCO's role in geopark initiative |url=http://geopark-bg.com/e_8.html |publisher=Geopark Iskar Panega |year=2007 |work=Geopark Iskar Panega website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319025602/http://geopark-bg.com/e_8.html |archivedate=2014-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Geoparks Network  aims at enhancing the value of such sites while at the same time creating [[employment]] and promoting regional [[economic development]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"/&gt; The Global Geoparks Network works in synergy with UNESCO's [[World Heritage]] Centre and [[Man and the Biosphere]] (MAB) World Network of Biosphere Reserves.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"/&gt;

===Qualification===
The Global Geoparks Network (GGN) is a UNESCO activity established in 1998. According to UNESCO, for a geopark to apply to be included in the GGN, it needs to:

* have a management plan designed to foster socio-economic development that is [[sustainable]] based on [[geotourism]]
* demonstrate methods for conserving and enhancing geological heritage and provide means for teaching geoscientific disciplines and broader environmental issues
* have joint proposals submitted by public authorities, local communities and private interests acting together, which demonstrate the best practices with respect to Earth heritage conservation and its integration into [[sustainable development]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;'April 2010 GEO4B/PM Advanced Level Examination - Advanced Information Booklet'&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9693">'''Gloria Lane''' (born June 6, 1930, [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[New Jersey]]) is an American [[opera]]tic [[mezzo-soprano]] who had an active international performance career from 1949 to 1976. In her early career she distinguished herself by creating roles in the world premieres of two operas by [[Gian Carlo Menotti]], the Secretary of the Consulate in ''[[The Consul]]'' (1950) and Desideria in ''[[The Saint of Bleecker Street]]'' (1954); both roles which she performed in successful runs on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and on international tours. For her performance in ''The Consul'' she was awarded a [[Clarence Derwent Award]] and two [[Donaldson Award]]s.

Lane was also a regular performer at the [[New York City Opera]] from 1952 to 1960, and was heard as a guest artist with several important American opera companies during the 1950s. After 1960, Lane's career was primarily centered in Europe. She made appearances in leading roles at many of the most important European [[opera house]]s during the 1960s, including [[La Scala]], [[The Royal Opera]], and the [[Vienna State Opera]] among others. She was particularly admired for her portrayal of the title heroine in [[Georges Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]''. In the 1970s she performed briefly as a [[dramatic soprano]] in performances at the [[Glyndebourne Festival]], [[Hawaii Opera Theatre]], and [[Vancouver Opera]]. After retiring from singing in 1977, she taught voice out of a private studio in Los Angeles.

==Early life and education==
Born Gussie Siet in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], Lane was the daughter of a junk dealer. In 1948, having had no formal voice training, she won the [[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'s annual 'Voice of Tomorrow Contest'. Winning the contest enabled her to pursue vocal studies with [[Elizabeth Westmoreland]] in Philadelphia. In 1949 she won a scholarship to the [[Tanglewood Music Center]] where she made her debut with the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] performing the title role in scenes from Bizet's ''[[Carmen]]'' under director [[Boris Goldovsky]].&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/17/entertainment/ca-lane17|title=A virtuoso scarlet woman|author=Diane Haithman|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
In 1950 Lane created the role of the Secretary of the Consulate in the world premiere of [[Gian Carlo Menotti]]'s ''[[The Consul]]''  at the Shubert Theater in Philadelphia. She continued with the production when it moved to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] later that year where it enjoyed a successful eight-month run.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Cecil, "''The Consul''. Musical Drama in Three Acts" (December 1950). ''Notes'' (2nd Ser.), '''8''' (1): pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=2137 ''The Consul''], Internet Broadway Database, accessed January 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; She also performed the role in the UK at the [[Cambridge Theatre]] in February 1951 and in Paris at the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] in May 1951.&lt;ref&gt;"A.J." (no full name given), Review of ''The Consul'' (1951). ''The Musical Times'', '''92''' (1298): p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Arthur, "The Consul" (July 1951). ''Music &amp; Letters'', '''32''' (3): pp. 247–251.&lt;/ref&gt; For her performance as the Secretary of the Consulate she won the [[Clarence Derwent Award]]  for best supporting actress in a musical role, and the [[Donaldson Award]]s for best supporting actress and best debut performance.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt;

In 1954 Lane returned to Broadway to appear in another Menotti world premiere, creating the role of Desideria in the [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning ''[[The Saint of Bleecker Street]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Opera|year=2001|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=0252026233|author=Elise Kuhl Kirk|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also sang that role for her debut at [[La Scala]] in 1955.

Lane made her debut with the [[New York City Opera]] as the Secretary of the Consulate in 1952. She sang several more roles with the NYCO from 1952-1960, including Amneris in ''[[Aida]]'', Annina in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'',  Antonia's mother in ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann]]'', Evadne in ''[[Troilus and Cressida (opera)|Troilus and Cressida]]'', Maddalena in ''[[Rigoletto]]'', the Mother in ''[[Amahl and the Night Visitors]]'', Salud in ''[[La vida breve]]'', and the title role ''[[Carmen]]''. She sang the title role in ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'' with the [[American Opera Society]] in 1953. That same year she sang Carmen and Meg Page in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor (opera)|The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' at the [[Central City Opera]]. In 1957 she created the role of the Countess in the world premiere of [[Stanley Hollingsworth]]'s ''[[La Grande Breteche]]'' which was commissioned for television by the [[NBC Opera Theatre]] (NBCOT). For other NBCOT television broadcasts she also portrayed Helene in ''[[War and Peace (opera)|War and Peace]]''(1957), Maddalena in ''[[Rigoletto]]'' (1958), and [[Marina Mniszech]] in ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' (1961).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1961/02/11/archives/refugees-to-mix-with-commuters-radio-free-europe-to-beam-penn.html|title=REFUGEES TO MIX WITH COMMUTERS; Radio Free Europe to Beam Penn Station Broadcasts to Iron Curtain Countries|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 11, 1961|author=Richard F. Shepherd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 Lane made her debut at the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]] as Princess Eboli in Verdi's ''[[Don Carlo]]'', where she was also heard that season as Ulrica in Verdi's ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]''. In 1958 she returned to La Scala to sing Carmen before making her debuts at both the [[Glyndebourne Festival]] and the [[Edinburgh Festival]] as Baba the Turk in Stravinsky's ''[[The Rake's Progress]]''. She also sang Carmen for her debuts at the [[Royal Opera House, Covent Garden]] and the [[San Francisco Opera]] in 1959, and for her debut at the [[Opera Company of Boston]] in 1960.

==International success==
During the 1960s Lane's career was primarily based in Europe and Canada. Among the opera companies with whom she sang leading roles during this time were the [[Canadian Opera Company]], the [[Edmond Opera Association]], the [[Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux]], La Fenice, La Scala,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/10/11/archives/music-some-grand-opera-a-la-scala-elena-suliotis-shines-in-verdis.html|title=Music: Some Grand Opera a la Scala; Elena Suliotis Shines in Verdi's 'Nabucco' Guelfi and Ghiaurov in Top Form at Expo|date=October 11, 1967|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Opéra National de Lyon]], the [[Teatro Comunale di Bologna]], the [[Teatro Giuseppe Verdi]], the [[Teatro Massimo]], [[Teatro Regio (Parma)|Teatro Regio di Parma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/01/07/archives/parma-opera-fans-hail-gloria-lane.html|title=Parma Opera Fans Hail Gloria Lane|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 7, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Teatro Regio (Turin)|Teatro Regio di Torino]], the [[Vienna State Opera]], and the [[Wexford Festival Opera]] among others. In 1961 she created the role of Beatrice in the world premiere of [[Renzo Rossellini (composer)|Renzo Rossellini]]'s ''[[Uno sguardo dal ponte]]'' at the [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma]]; a role she also sang for the opera's American premiere with the [[Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;*[[Free Library of Philadelphia]]: ''Box: Phila. Lyric Opera Company: 782.1 P5326p Bal Two [1968 - 1975]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 she portrayed Desideria at the [[Festival dei Due Mondi]] in Spoleto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/07/08/archives/menottis-saint-given-at-spoleto-public-shows-enthusiasm-but-critics.html|title=Menotti's 'Saint' Given At Spoleto; Public Shows Enthusiasm, but Critics Are Cool|author=Robert C. Doty|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 8, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and career==
In the late 1960s, Lane's career had begun to dwindle in terms of the number of bookings. She attempted to revitalize her career by switching her [[fach]] to that of a [[dramatic soprano]]; beginning with Santuzza in ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' with the [[Vancouver Opera]] in 1971. She was heard later that year at the Glyndebourne Festival in the title role of Strauss' ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' and as Lady Macbeth in Verdi's ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]''. Although reviews of her performance were positive overall, she failed to elicit much more work after this point. In 1974 she gave her last performance in a staged production as Desdemona in ''[[Otello]]'' at the [[Hawaii Opera Theater]]. Her final notable project was a 1976 recording of Katerina Ismailova in [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'' for [[RAI]].

After retiring from the stage, Lane settled in Los Angeles where she taught voice out of a private studio. Her notable students included Pamela Scanlon, Christine Kelley, and Francis Liska. She was married to the late conductor [[Samuel Krachmalnick]] for 50 years.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt;

The '''Gukjagam''', known at times as '''Gukhak''' or '''Seonggyungwan''', was the highest educational institution of the [[Korea]]n [[Goryeo]] dynasty.  It was located at the capital, [[Kaesong|Gaegyeong]] (modern-day Kaesong), and provided advanced training in the [[Chinese classics]].  It was established in 992 during the reign of [[Seongjong of Goryeo|Seongjong]]. Its name has been changed to Songgyungam in 1298 and to Songgyungwam in 1308. Its current name is Koryo (/Goryeo) Songyungwam University/University of Light Industry. A similar institution, known as the ''Gukhak'', had been established under [[Unified Silla]], but it was not successful.

The Gukjagam was part of Seongjong's general program of Confucian reform, together with the ''[[gwageo]]'' civil service examinations and the ''[[hyanggyo]]'' provincial schools.  It formed the cornerstone of the Confucian educational system he envisioned.  In the waning days of Goryeo, the Gukjagam again became a centerpiece of reform through the policies of the early [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] scholar [[An Hyang]].


==Courses of study==
In the beginning, the Gukjagam provided a total of six courses of study.  Of these, three divisions were restricted to children of the highest-ranking officials:  Gukjahak, Taehak, and Samunhak.  These were a total of nine years long, and focused on the Confucian classics.

The other three divisions were open to children of officials as low as the 8th rank:  Seohak (secretarial training), Sanhak ([[arithmetic]]), and Yulhak (law).  Each of these took six years to complete, and focused on technical training with a heavy admixture of the classics.

A seventh division was added in 1104, in the reign of [[Yejong of Goryeo|Yejong]]:  Gangyejae (강예재), providing military training.  This was the first recorded occasion of a Korean dynasty providing formal training in the military arts.  Due to tensions between the aristocracy and the military, it was soon removed from the curriculum, in 1133.

==Finances==
Seongjong's original edict of 992 provided land and slaves to support the school.  However, the tuition remained prohibitive for most students not from wealthy families.  In 1304, An Hyang levied a new tax which officials of the top 6 ranks had to pay in silver, and those of the lower ranks in cloth.  This tax was used to defray the cost of tuition for the Gukjagam's students.

==Names==
The name was changed to Gukhak in 1275, upon the ascension of [[Chungnyeol of Goryeo|King Chungnyeol]].  It was changed to Seonggyungam in 1298 and to Seonggyungwan in 1308, but then reverted to Gukjagam during the reign of [[Gongmin of Goryeo|Gongmin]] in 1358.  The Seonggyungwan name was adopted again in 1362, and continued in use until the fall of Goryeo thirty years later.

'''Hans Ulrich''' "'''Sepp'''" '''Gumbrecht''' (born 1948) is a literary theorist whose work spans [[philology]], philosophy, literary and cultural history, and [[Epistemology|epistemologies]] of the everyday. A professor at [[Stanford University]] since 1989, he holds the [[Albert Léon Guérard|Albert Guérard]] Chair as Professor in the Departments of [[Comparative literature|Comparative Literature]] and [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] in Stanford's Division of Literatures, Languages, and Cultures; by courtesy, he is also affiliated with the Departments of [[German studies|German Studies]], [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] and Latin American Cultures, and the Program in Modern Thought and Literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht {{!}} DIVISION OF LITERATURES, CULTURES, AND LANGUAGES|url = https://dlcl.stanford.edu/people/hans-ulrich-gumbrecht|website = dlcl.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gumbrecht's writing on philosophy and modern thought extends from the [[Middle Ages]] to today and incorporates an array of disciplines and styles, at times combining historical and philosophical inquiry with elements of memoir. Much of Gumbrecht's scholarship has focused on national literatures in French, Spanish, Portuguese, and German, and he is known for his work on the Western philosophical tradition, the materiality of presence, shifting views of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], forms of aesthetic experience, and the joys of watching sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht {{!}} DIVISION OF LITERATURES, CULTURES, AND LANGUAGES|url = https://dlcl.stanford.edu/people/hans-ulrich-gumbrecht|website = dlcl.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as publishing academic works and teaching graduate and undergraduate students at Stanford, Gumbrecht is recognized as a public intellectual in Europe and South America and contributes to a range of newspapers and journals in English, German, Portuguese, and Spanish.

== Life and education ==
Born οn June 15, 1948 in [[Würzburg]], Germany, Gumbrecht graduated from the Siebold Gymnasium of his hometown in 1967, also having studied at Lycée Henri IV in Paris. He specialized in [[Romance languages|Romance Philology]] and [[German literature|German Literature]], but also studied philosophy and sociology during his university years, which took him to [[Munich]], [[Regensburg]], [[Province of Salamanca|Salamanca]], [[Pavia]], and [[Konstanz]].&lt;ref name="dlcl.stanford.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht {{!}} DIVISION OF LITERATURES, CULTURES, AND LANGUAGES|url = https://dlcl.stanford.edu/people/hans-ulrich-gumbrecht|website = dlcl.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving his Ph.D. at the [[University of Konstanz]] in 1971, he became Assistant Professor, acquiring the ''[[Venia legendi]]'' (Habilitation) in Romance Literatures and Literary Theory in 1974.&lt;ref name="dlcl.stanford.edu"/&gt;

Gumbrecht was a Full Professor at the [[Ruhr University Bochum|University of Bochum]] from 1975 to 1982, and from 1983 to 1989 at the University Siegen, where he founded the first [[Humanities]] Graduate Program in Germany, which was dedicated to the topic "Forms of Communication as Forms of Life."&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hans Gumbrecht|url = http://shc.stanford.edu/news/experts-bureau/hans-gumbrecht|website = Stanford Humanities|accessdate = 2015-10-26|first = Humanities at|last = Stanford}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1983 to 1985, Gumbrecht was Vice President of the German Association of Romance Philology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hrk.de/fileadmin/redaktion/hrk/02-Dokumente/CV_Prof._Gumbrecht.pdf|title = CV Prof. Gumbrecht|date = 2015|accessdate = October 26, 2015|website = www.hrk.de|publisher = Hochschulrektorenkonferenz.|last = Gumbrecht|first = Hans Ulrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been offered the [[Albert Léon Guérard|Albert Guérard]] Chair at [[Stanford University]], he moved to Palo Alto in 1989.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; While at Stanford he has taught classes to graduate and undergraduate students, advised over 100 dissertations and honors theses, and continued to publish regularly.

On February 9–10, 2018, a conference titled "After 1967: Methods and Moods in Literary Studies in Honor of Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht" was held at Stanford to commemorate Gumbrecht's fifty-year career. Over forty scholars of theory, philosophy, and literary studies who had worked with Gumbrecht attended the conference. Stanford football coach [[David Shaw (American football)|David Shaw]] also attended.

== Scholarly work ==

=== ''Stimmung'', or cultural moods ===
Gumbrecht has written extensively on ''"[[Stimmung]]"'', a [[German language|German]] word also referencing the [[Musical tuning|tuning]] of musical instruments, but more commonly meaning "[[wikt:mood|mood]]" and as such used by Gumbrecht to indicate the [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] or atmosphere of a particular era or artistic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Atmosphere, Mood, Stimmung: On a Hidden Potential of Literature|last = Gumbrecht|first = Hans Ulrich|publisher = Stanford University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780804781220|location = Stanford|pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has used this theme to write about both daily life on a broad cultural scale and interpretative practices in the [[humanities]].&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;

By identifying specific moods as temporal in nature, he attempts to capture the spirit of particular time periods and to recreate how they were experienced by people living at those times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = In 1926 — Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht {{!}} Harvard University Press|url = http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674000551|website = www.hup.harvard.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does so by examining how everyday activities, material and aesthetic experiences, and reading processes shape individual and cultural understandings of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = In 1926 — Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht {{!}} Harvard University Press|url = http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674000551|website = www.hup.harvard.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gumbrecht's first work to locate a temporal mood was ''In 1926: Living on the Edge of Time'' (1998), which associates excitement and anticipation with the emergence of new and faster-paced activities, forms of entertainment, and ways of thinking.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = In 1926: Living on the Edge of Time|last = Gumbrecht|first = Hans Ulrich|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 1998|isbn = 9780674000551|location = Cambridge, MA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book presents fragments of life from various geographical locations, large-scale events and private practices, and perspectives of both celebrities and ordinary individuals. Events described range from boxing matches to bar conversations, and Gumbrecht profiles artistic greats and public figures alongside workers, farmers, and engineers to depict the emergence of new sensibilities that transcended boundaries of class, race, gender, or nation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In ''After 1945: Latency as Origin of the Present'' (2013), Gumbrecht explores the legacy of [[World War II]] through an investigation of a widespread cultural mood, primarily in [[Germany]] but also relating to a broader response to the aftermath of war. He describes a climate ''(Stimmung)'' in which "a disposition of violent nervousness permeates the seemingly quiet postwar world, which points to a latent state of affairs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = After 1945: Latency as Origin of the Present|last = Gumbrecht|first = Hans Ulrich|publisher = Stanford University Press|year = 2013|isbn = 9780804785181|location = Stanford|pages = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mood of latency has implications for cultural identity today in the form of a widely felt sense of inertia and a changed relationship to time: the argument is that from the vantage point of the postwar years, the future came to be viewed as a threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Françoise Meltzer reviews Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht’s After 1945: Latency as Origin of the Present – Critical Inquiry|url = http://criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu/Francoise_Meltzer_reviews_Hans_Ulrich_Gumbrecht/|website = criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-03|first = University of Chicago IT|last = Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While these are two of Gumbrecht's more detailed elaborations on temporal moods, ''Stimmung'' relates also to a broader concept of moods that can be triggered by aesthetic experiences to produce a sense of "presence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Atmosphere, Mood, Stimmung: On a Hidden Potential of Literature {{!}} Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht translated by Erik Butler|url = http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=21913|website = www.sup.org|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gumbrecht elaborates this theme further in his works about the material component of literary study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Production of Presence: What Meaning Cannot Convey {{!}} Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht|url = http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=1360|website = www.sup.org|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presence and materiality ===

Through the concept of Stimmung, Gumbrecht has argued that certain cultural events and aesthetic experiences can become "present," or have a tangible effect on human senses, emotions, and bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Our Broad Present: Time and Contemporary Culture|last = Gumbrecht|first = Hans Ulrich|publisher = Columbia University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 9780231163606|location = New York|pages = ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea underlies Gumbrecht's writing about [[literary criticism]] and methods of interpretation, and also much of his other work on material forms of culture, communication, and understanding in the 20th and 21st centuries. Presence is a central concept to many of his books, including ''In 1926: Living on the Edge of Time'' (1998), ''Production of Presence: What Meaning Cannot Convey'' (2003), ''The Powers of Philology: Dynamics of Textual Scholarship'' (2003), ''Atmosphere, Mood, Stimmung: On a Hidden Potential of Literature'' (2012), ''After 1945: Latency as Origin of the Present'' (2013), and ''Our Broad Present: Time and Contemporary Culture'' (2014).

Throughout his writing, Gumbrecht emphasizes the importance of material experience to consuming literature and art. In ''Atmosphere, Mood, Stimmung: On a Hidden Potential of Literature'' (2012), Gumbrecht applies the concept of mood to the process of reading literary works. He argues that the function of literature is to "make present," and treats aesthetic experiences as concrete encounters that affect a reader or viewer's physical environment or body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Atmosphere, Mood, Stimmung: On a Hidden Potential of Literature|last = Gumbrecht|first = |publisher = |year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By connecting presence to art, especially the art of literature, in his description of language as a material component of the world, Gumbrecht returns to his roots in the study of philology, moving beyond [[Deconstruction]]'s concept of language. He writes, "'Reading for ''Stimmung''' always means paying attention to the textual dimension of the forms that envelop us and our bodies as a physical reality—something that can catalyze inner feelings without matters of representation necessarily being involved."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Atmosphere, Mood, Stimmung: On a Hidden Potential of Literature|last = Gumbrecht|first = |publisher = |year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing on the atmosphere produced by a work of literature and experienced by the work's reader, he argues, is crucial to the intellectual practice of reading and analyzing literature.&lt;ref name="Gumbrecht 2012"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Atmosphere, Mood, Stimmung: On a Hidden Potential of Literature|last = Gumbrecht|first = |publisher = |year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 interview with Gumbrecht, Ulrik Ekman describes Gumbrecht's work on presence as an "extremely intricate oscillation between a move, perhaps unavoidable, towards epistemological sense-making and conceptualization on the one hand, and, on the other, an at least formally opening move in the direction of ontological concerns."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Speed of Beauty: Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, Interviewed by Ulrik Ekman|url = http://pmc.iath.virginia.edu/issue.506/16.3ekman.html|website = pmc.iath.virginia.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gumbrecht links the practice of interpretation as the search for meaning or "sense-making" with a form of understanding that is unique to the social and historical context, as well as the material and bodily experience, of the reader.&lt;ref name="Gumbrecht 2012"/&gt;

=== Critique of the literary analytical tradition    ===

Gumbrecht's focus on presence in the reading of literature is significant for his elaboration of a "post-[[hermeneutic]]" form of [[literary criticism]]. He has argued that the emphasis on interpretation in academic intellectual practices is incomplete, and that the "meaning-only" model of understanding it produces does not account for the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] experience of the arts.

In ''Production of Presence'' (2003), Gumbrecht critizises the status of literary study in university settings, arguing that the [[humanities]] over-emphasize the importance of interpretation, or "the reconstruction and attribution of meaning."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Production of Presence: What Meaning Cannot Convey|last = Gumbrecht|first = Hans Ulrich|publisher = Stanford University Press|year = 2003|isbn = 9780804749169|location = Stanford|pages = xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he argues for an intellectual practice that would take into account the importance of "presence," or material engagement with the artistic works being examined.

Gumbrecht traces the emphasis on meaning and interpretation back to [[Early modern Europe|Early Modernity]], drawing from [[Martin Heidegger]]'s concept of "Being" and commenting on the work of many other scholars, including [[Jacques Derrida]]'s writing on overcoming [[metaphysics]]. Gumbrecht critiques the emphasis on [[reason]] and [[rationality]] that originated with the [[Age of Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Production of Presence: What Meaning Cannot Convey|last = Gumbrecht|first = |publisher = |year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = 42–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in particular, references [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'', and ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'', as well as the Cartesian tendency to exclude presence from metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Production of Presence: What Meaning Cannot Convey|last = Gumbrecht|first = |publisher = |year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = 33–5, 43–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These modes of [[conceptualization]] have become ingrained in philosophical analysis and other intellectual inquiry in the [[humanities]].

Gumbrecht highlights the importance of modes of "world-appropriation" that do not focus on locating or discerning meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Production of Presence: What Meaning Cannot Convey|last = Gumbrecht|first = |publisher = |year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes three principle methods meant to define the future, non-[[hermeneutical]] function of the [[humanities]]. These are [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], presentification, and deixis. Epiphany refers to a moment of intensity or loss of control related to viewing an artistic work; presentification refers to immersing oneself in the past moment of the artwork's production; deixis involves the "lived experience" of artistic work, rather than the imposition of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Production of Presence: What Meaning Cannot Convey|last = Gumbrecht|first = |publisher = |year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = 91–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The aesthetics of sport ===
Gumbrecht has also written on the spectatorship of [[sport]], using [[philosophy]] and the history of [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletics]] to present an analytical perspective on the precise ways sport is consumed and appreciated. Most notably in his book ''In Praise of Athletic Beauty'' (2006), but also in articles such as "Epiphany of Form: On the Beauty of Team Sports"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Epiphany of Form: On the Beauty of Team Sports|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/new_literary_history/v030/30.2gumbrecht.html|journal = New Literary History|date = 1999-01-01|issn = 1080-661X|pages = 351–372|volume = 30|issue = 2|doi = 10.1353/nlh.1999.0024|first = Hans Ulrich|last = Gumbrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt; and interviews with newspapers and academic sources, he examines the widespread cultural fascination with athletics in the 21st century and in historical contexts.

Gumbrecht's project is to provide a new mode for exploring and understanding the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] experience of sports spectatorship, or what precisely makes certain athletic moves and plays "beautiful." In his discussion of the ways beauty can be ascribed to athletes' actions, Gumbrecht describes the effect of perceiving athletes to be "lost in focused intensity,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = In Praise of Athletic Beauty|last = Gumbrecht|first = Hans Ulrich|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2006|isbn = 067402172X|location = Cambridge, MA|pages = 50–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how the players' physical presence and performance of ability lead the spectator—or "everyfan"—to attribute meaning to athletes' movements, but also to feel affected emotionally.

Among other elements, Gumbrecht also presents as key elements of spectatorship the importance of styles of [[communication]] and [[sociality]] among fans and the spectators' sense of gratitude toward players. That gratitude is sparked by "special moments of intensity" when athletes appear to go beyond the limits of human performance—which, in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] culture, was seen as occurring in the presence of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = In Praise of Athletic Beauty|last = Gumbrecht|first = |publisher = |year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 230–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often means successful performance, but can also relate to the suffering, pain, and loss also experienced in the sporting arena.

Gumbrecht's writing on [[sport]] interconnects with his concepts of presence and materiality insofar as the activity of watching takes on a communal character, offering spectators "opportunities to immerse themselves in the realm of presence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = In Praise of Athletic Beauty|last = Gumbrecht|first = |publisher = |year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gumbrecht cites [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s distinction between [[Dionysian]] and [[Apollonian and Dionysian|Apollonian]] attitudes, where the Dionysian spectator tends "to revel in communion both with other spectators and with the energy that emerges from the action they are following," while the Apollonian spectator "has a greater affinity with the concept of analysis than with the concept of communion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = In Praise of Athletic Beauty|last = Gumbrecht|first = |publisher = |year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 212}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Gumbrecht does not present one form as superior to the other, he notes the contemporary tendency to attach social anxiety to the frenzy of crowds, linking this to "the nightmare of [[Fascism]] still haunting the West."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = In Praise of Athletic Beauty|last = Gumbrecht|first = |publisher = |year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gumbrecht acknowledges the occurrence of fights and [[hooliganism]] at sporting events, but focuses instead on the sense of communion that watching athletics can produce—for example, through acts of cheering, chanting, or even doing "the Wave." Though he asks how [[Media technology|modern media technology]] has changed the viewing habits of sports fans, his focus is on the sensation of presence—even if that presence is produced through the illusion of the screen. The energy of the crowd, in combination with the other [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] and emotional responses evoked by watching athletic aptitude, leads to the range of "fascinations" Gumbrecht incorporates into his method for describing and expressing appreciation for [[sport]].

=== Other writing ===
In addition to his work on presence, materiality, and [[hermeneutics]] in the [[humanities]], Gumbrecht's main areas of research, teaching, and publishing include:
* European literature of the [[Middle Age]]s and of the late 18th and 19th centuries;
* the history and critique of Western [[metaphysics]]; 
* history and pragmatics of communication media; and,
* the [[epistemology]] of everyday [[culture]]. 
Gumbrecht's publications are extensive and in many languages. He wrote primarily in [[German language|German]] during his early career, and in English after moving to the United States in 1989. He also writes in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and his works are regularly translated into [[French language|French]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and several other languages.

{{refimprove|date=September 2018}}

In [[Education in the United Kingdom|British education]], a '''housemaster''' (or, less commonly, a '''housemistress''') is a member of [male] staff in charge of a [[house system|boarding house]], normally at a [[boarding school]] (e.g., especially at a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Public school (UK)|public school]]). The housemaster is responsible for the supervision and care of boarders in the house and typically lives on the premises. The term '''houseparent''' is also sometimes used, most commonly when a married couple share the role. In addition, there is often an '''assistant housemaster''' (or '''assistant housemistress''') acting as a deputy.

==Duties==

The Housemaster's primary role is leading and running their boarding house, along with (if any) an assistant housemaster/mistress, resident tutors, senior prefects or a pupil 'head-of-house'. 
The Housemaster has a vast range of duties and responsibilities, ranging from the pastoral care of their boarders to everyday basic maintenance, laundry and organisational tasks. His top priority is caring for his boarders' physical and mental well-being and he does this by getting to know his charges, guiding them daily and offering them support and advice. The Housemaster acts as the parent or leader of the house and deals with any problem the boarder may have.
Depending on the size of the house he may or may not have a team of staff working with him, such as other pastoral staff, housekeeping/cleaning staff and medical. 
The list of duties could consist of anything that a child needs help with, to the physical upkeep of the building and administrative work.

The Housemaster additionally may be a teacher, sports coach, cadet forces instructor, or just a Housemaster, etc. In this way, he is often involved in the activities his boarders undertake.

==Relationship with boarders==

Often, as the post is almost always residential, a close bond develops between the boarders and Housemaster. The Housemaster has the care of his boarders, not only as his job, but - depending on the individual - will have it as a personal way of life. As boarders obviously live together and make friends with each other, a community spirit fosters between the boarders themselves and naturally the Housemaster leading them. Many boarding houses have names, sometimes of a famous person, or a person with a strong connection and important history within the school, or they may be more functional names. Many schools, like [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]], will have houses named after old-boys or important figures of the school, whilst others, like [[Eton College|Eton]], will refer to houses mostly by the initials of the housemaster. 
Regardless of the name, with each house having an identity, a sense of pride develops for the Housemaster to see his house as a fine one, with good qualities as the fabric of it.  Many houses are known for certain attributes or characteristics, such as hard-working, kind, organized, good at sports, musical, academically-gifted or noble and brave. The Housemaster will have an important part in ensuring the good reputation and image that his house develops.

The Housemaster is the master of discipline, as well as support, for the boarders. He maintains authority in his own manner within his house (and across the school). It is a semi-autonomous position and the Housemaster may have a wide range of ways in dealing with unruly or unwanted behaviour, such as official sanctions (such as detentions or extra duties), but must also recognise when negative behaviour may be covering something worse that his happening in his boarder's life, which will require more tact. The Housemaster will frequently be the first port-of-call for other members of staff, including non-boarding teachers and boarding staff, when they have queries of a boarder. So the Housemaster must be prepared to give an honest, accurate account of the boarder as a whole, as well as defend if necessary the boarder if he is in trouble. 
In the boarders' eyes, the Housemaster is the ultimate (less parents or Headmaster/mistress) person who they know will always condemn or support certain behaviour and actions of the boarder.

'''Knowledge-Centered Service''' ('''KCS'''; previously known as Knowledge-Centered Support) is a service delivery method that focuses on knowledge as a key asset of the organization implementing it.  Development began in 1992 by the [https://www.serviceinnovation.org/ Consortium for Service Innovation],&lt;ref name= "serviceinnovation1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.serviceinnovation.org |title=Consortium for Service Innovation | accessdate= 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit alliance of service organizations. Its methodology is to integrate use of a [[knowledge base]] into the workflow.

While the legacy of KCS lies in customer support organizations, the methodology is now being adopted across all the functions of business, as noted in the latest version of the KCS v6 Practices Guide.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

KCS seeks to:
* Create content as a by-product of solving problems
* Evolve content based on demand and usage &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.serviceinnovation.org/KCS_Kernel/020/030|title=Demand Driven - Consortium for Service Innovation|last=|first=|date=|website=library.serviceinnovation.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Develop a [[knowledge base]] of an organization's collective experience to-date  
* Reward learning, collaboration, sharing and improving

With over 20 years in development and over $50 million invested in developing the methodology, KCS has produced significant benefits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dbkay.com/coaching/kcs-case-study|title=KCS Case Study Real Value|last=|first=|date=|website=dbkay.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for support organizations around the world, including Apollo Group, Autodesk, Avaya, Dell, EMC, Ericsson, HP Enterprise, Omgeo/DTCC, Oracle, PTC, Salesforce.com and SDL.

[http://www.thekcsacademy.net/ The KCS Academy] is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Consortium for Service Innovation. The KCS Academy is the only designated certification body by the Consortium for Service Innovation. The KCS Academy offers certification programs for people and a KCS ''Verified'' program for knowledge base tools that enable the KCS practices.

==History==
Development began in 1992 by the Consortium for Service Innovation,&lt;ref name="serviceinnovation1"/&gt; a non-profit alliance of support organizations. Its premise is to capture, structure, and reuse technical support knowledge. Initially it was known as Solution-Centered Support, and was renamed to acknowledge the methodology as best practices in knowledge management.

The Consortium for Service Innovation was founded in Seattle in 1992 by Symbologic. Shelly Benton was the founding Executive Director{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} and built the membership-based organization.  The early work of the Consortium was used to identify features and functionality for a tool that would help organizations capture and reuse knowledge as a by-product of doing work.

From 1992 to 1994 the nature of the member's conversation was largely focused on technology.  However the members began to see that success{{citation needed |date= May 2016}} in capturing and reusing knowledge was more about people and their behaviors{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} than it was about the tool. From 1994 to 1996 the conversation shifted to defining a methodology that focused on people and the organizational culture.

As the conversation evolved{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} both the members of the Consortium and Symbologic agreed{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} that the Consortium's work was about much more than technology and that both the work and the members would be better served{{citation needed |date= May 2016}} by being independent and vendor agnostic. In 1996 Greg Oxton, who was a member of the Consortium at the time, joined{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} the Consortium staff with the goal of creating a member funded non-profit organization.

In January 1997 the Consortium became an independent legal entity registered as a 501(c)(6) with the Internal Revenue Service. At that time it was called the Customer Support Consortium.

From 1997 through 1999 the Consortium members began to report dramatic benefits{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} from implementing the methodology. In 1999 the Consortium released the first Practices Guide.  This was written by Livia Wilson and John Chamj. With the help of the members who shared their adoption experiences and results Wilson and Chamj created the first prescriptive, comprehensive definition on how to do KCS.

For the next few years the Consortium facilitated{{citation needed |date=May 2016}} member conversations and based on a model of collective thinking{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} and shared experiences continued to evolve{{citation needed |date= May 2016}} the KCS methodology.

In 2003, [https://www.thinkhdi.com/ HDI] partnered with the Consortium for Service Innovation to promote the learnings and experiences of the Consortium's members to the market. Working together, they captured this information into a three-day workshop{{citation needed |date=May 2016}}: The Knowledge Management Foundations: KCS Principles course now known as ''KCS Principles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkhdi.com/kcs|title= KCS Principles|publisher=Think HDI |accessdate= 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, hundreds of companies{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} have been learning about and implementing Knowledge Centered Service within their environments.

In 2005, the Consortium for Service Innovation introduced the KCS-Verified&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.serviceinnovation.org/kcsverified |title=The KCS Academy » Tools |publisher=Service innovation |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate= 2015-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106175932/http://serviceinnovation.org/kcsverified/ |archivedate=2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; program for knowledge management software vendors. There are a number of popular software applications verified to enable the KCS best practices to learn more about KCS Verified products.  This program defines the functional requirements that software vendors must implement to successfully enable KCS. Implementation is then verified by KCS certified at one of levels, "Aligned"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thekcsacademy.net/get-aligned |title=Get Aligned |publisher= The KCS Academy |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate= 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Verified".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thekcsacademy.net/tools/get-verified |title=Get Verified |publisher= The KCS Academy |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate= 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Program implementation is enabled through experts through the Consortium for Service Innovation or other certified practitioners.

In 2006, the Consortium updated KCS to version 4.1 and published the Practices Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.serviceinnovation.org/included/docs/kcs_practicesguide.pdf |format= PDF |title=KCS Version 5.3: Knowledge-Centered Support Practices Guide |publisher=Service innovation |accessdate= 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 5.0 and 5.1 were published in 2011. Version 5.3 was published in 2012 and version 6.0 in 2016. They continue to evolve{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} KCS through the experiences of their members and other companies that share their personal stories.

In 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkhdi.com/about/press-room/2007/2007-05-02-2.aspx|title= New HDI Support Center Director Certification, Online Delivery of HDI Support Center Analyst Certification Training and HDI Knowledge Management Foundations: KCS® Principles Certification|publisher=Think HDI |accessdate= 2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; HDI introduced the first KCS certification in the industry with the KCS Principles Certification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkhdi.com/kcscert|title= KCS Principles Certification|publisher= Think HDI |accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allows individuals to demonstrate their knowledge of the KCS methodology and how to implement it.

In 2010, The KCS Academy was formed as an outreach company of the Consortium for Service Innovation.  Development of the KCS Certified Publisher exam began and became publicly available in 2011.

In June 2014, [[AXELOS]] and HDI jointly published a whitepaper on the [https://www.axelos.com/case-studies-and-white-papers/synergies-between-itil-knowledge-centered-support Synergies between ITIL and KCS]. While KCS and [[ITIL]] were developed independently, guidance on how these two best practices can be used together to enhance service management processes is helping support organizations to improve their operations.

In April 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thekcsacademy.net/2016/04/introducing-kcs-v6/|title= Blog Archive » Introducing KCS v6|website= The KCS Academy |access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Consortium for Service Innovation released KCS v6. This released renamed Knowledge Centered Support to Knowledge Centered Service. The terminology in the methodology was updated to be more generic as KCS adoption has expanded beyond the technical support environment to the enterprise.  The following documents were published: [http://library.serviceinnovation.org/KCS_Kernel KCS Principles and Core Concepts] and the [http://library.serviceinnovation.org/KCS_Practices_Guide_v6 KCS v6 Practices Guide]

The '''Alfred M. Landon Lecture Series''' is a series of [[Public speaking|speeches]] on current public affairs, which is organized and hosted by [[Kansas State University]] in [[Manhattan, Kansas]]. It is named after Kansas politician [[Alf Landon]], former [[Governor of Kansas]] and [[United States presidential election, 1936|Republican presidential candidate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of The: Landon Lectures | publisher = Kansas State University | url = http://ome.ksu.edu/lectures/landon/history.html | accessdate = March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first lecture in the series was given by Landon on December 13, 1966.&lt;ref name=LandonSpeakers&gt;{{cite web | title = Landon Lecture Series – Past Speakers | publisher = Kansas State University | url = http://ome.ksu.edu/lectures/landon/past.html | accessdate = February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lecture series has been described as "prestigious,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Thomas | first = Ricks | title = Why South Korea and others should take a page from Israel in how to handle the U.S. | newspaper = Foreign Policy | date = June 6, 2013 | url = https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/06/06/why-south-korea-and-others-should-take-a-page-from-israel-in-how-to-handle-the-u-s/ | accessdate = March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Matt | first = Moline | title = Roberts discusses policy, goals | newspaper = Topeka Capital Journal | date = May 4, 2004 | url = http://cjonline.com/stories/050404/kan_robertsdiscuss.shtml#.VPOSl_t4y_E | accessdate = March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Jim| first = Garamone| title = Dempsey: Americans will shape image of modern vet | newspaper = American Forces Press Service | date = October 2, 2012 | url = http://www.retirees.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123320595 | accessdate = March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Jan | first = Landon | title = Kansas was Bobby's first campaign stop | newspaper = Topeka Capital Journal | date = December 10, 2006 | url = http://cjonline.com/stories/121006/loc_ksbobby.shtml#.VPYLNvt4y_E | accessdate = March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eric Lichtblau]] noted in his 2008 book ''Bush's Law: The Remaking of American Justice'' that the "Landon Lecture Series has provided an unlikely but powerful platform allowing world leaders, from Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev to Jimmy Carter and Henry Kissinger, to expound on the critical public issues of the day."&lt;ref name=Lichtblau&gt;{{cite book | last = Lichtblau | first = Eric | title = Bush's Law: The Remaking of American Justice | publisher = Pantheon | date = 2008 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=p8nv5JTj8fEC&amp;pg=PT218&amp;lpg=PT218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the speakers who have delivered Landon Lectures are nine [[Nobel laureate]]s, eight [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winners, and more than 40 [[List of Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients|Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients]].

== Notable speeches ==
Seven of the ten men to serve as [[List of Presidents of the United States|U.S. President]] since the series began in 1966 have delivered Landon lectures (excluding Lyndon B. Johnson, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump).&lt;ref name=LandonSpeakers/&gt; George W. Bush (2006), Ronald Reagan (1982) and Richard Nixon (1970) delivered speeches during their tenure in office. Bill Clinton (2007), Jimmy Carter (1991) and Gerald Ford (1978) spoke after leaving office. George H. W. Bush delivered a Landon Lecture while serving as [[Vice President of the United States]] in 1985, before being elected to the Presidency. Before Reagan delivered his Landon Lecture as U.S. President in 1982, he previously spoke in the series in 1967, while [[Governor of California]].

Other sitting U.S. federal officials to speak in the series include: Vice President [[Walter Mondale]]; Senate Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]]; Minority Leaders [[Hugh Scott]], [[Howard Baker]] and [[Tom Daschle]]; House Speakers [[Tip O'Neill]] and [[Jim Wright]]; Supreme Court justices [[Sandra Day O’Connor]] and [[Sonia Sotomayor]]; and Attorney General [[Janet Reno]].&lt;ref name=LandonSpeakers/&gt; In addition, nine current or former foreign heads of state have also spoken in the series, including former Soviet Premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], former British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], former Malawian President [[Joyce Banda]], and former Mexican President [[Ernesto Zedillo]].&lt;ref name=LandonSpeakers/&gt;

=== Robert F. Kennedy (1968) ===
U.S. Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] was one of twenty-two active U.S. Senators to deliver a lecture in the series (including also his brother [[Ted Kennedy]] in 1984). Kennedy's speech on March 18, 1968, "[[Conflict in Vietnam and at Home]]", is notable for being the first speech Kennedy delivered after announcing his much-anticipated [[Robert F. Kennedy presidential campaign, 1968|candidacy for the U.S. presidency]] two days earlier.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Evan | title =Robert Kennedy: His Life | publisher = Simon and Schuster | date = 2013 | page = 362 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ofXSLln9a3QC&amp;pg=PA362}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign speech was attended by a crowd of 14,500 people, and Kennedy used the opportunity to share anti-war views on the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Robert | title = CONFLICT IN VIETNAM AND AT HOME | publisher = ksu.edu Landon Lecture website | date = March 18, 1968 | url = http://ome.ksu.edu/lectures/landon/trans/Kennedy68.html | accessdate = March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evan Thomas]] wrote in his biography of Kennedy that "the setting was ideal for a raucous campaign kickoff."&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt; Kennedy was [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassinated]] less than three months later, on June 6, 1968, after winning the California Democratic primary.

=== Gen. William Westmoreland (1969) ===
U.S. General [[William Westmoreland]], a main target for [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|student protests]] against the [[Vietnam War]], spoke on April 9, 1969.&lt;ref name=Protest&gt;{{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = Joel | title = The Voice of Violence: Performative Violence as Protest in the Vietnam Era | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | date = 2001 | pages = 190-191 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aZ1ySKwlqPAC&amp;pg=PA191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative newspaper in [[Lawrence, Kansas]], wrote afterwards: "The man himself came to speak to the students of Kansas State. Yes, General William Westmoreland decided to deliver his first college lecture since returning from Viet Nam here, and he could not have picked a better place. Kansas State students will be courteous at all times... The General was greeted by applause, by cheering, by approval."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Up The General's Ass | newspaper = Reconstruction | location = Lawrence, KS | date = April 21, 1969 | url = http://www.lawrence.com/news/2009/feb/06/reconstruction-will-not-be-televised/?print | accessdate = March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Richard Nixon (1970) ===
U.S. President Richard Nixon spoke at the Landon Lecture Series on September 16, 1970.&lt;ref name=Protest/&gt; As [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|student protestors]] gathered outside, Nixon delivered what the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' called "one of the strongest and most uncompromising speeches of his career," denouncing the protests as part of a "cancerous disease" that is gripping the United States. Nixon asserted: "we face the greatest crisis in the history of American education today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Nixon | first = Richard | title = IT'S TIME TO STAND UP AND BE COUNTED | publisher = ksu.edu Landon Lecture website | date = September 16, 1970 | url = http://ome.ksu.edu/lectures/landon/trans/nixon70.html | accessdate = March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete speech was aired on network television, and then rebroadcast on several local stations after Nixon supporters purchased time to re-air it.

=== Ian Smith (1980) ===
Former [[Rhodesia]]n Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]] was scheduled to deliver a Landon Lecture on October 31, 1980. The speech was disrupted by protestors objecting to the denial of voting rights to blacks in the former Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) under Smith's governance. Due to the controversy, the speech was recategorized as a non-Landon Lecture and is not included in the history of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Acker | first = Duane | title = Two At A Time: Reflections and Revelations of a Kansas State University Presidency | publisher = iUniverse | date = 2010 | page = 187 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0oJlwqIelwsC&amp;pg=PA186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ashleigh Banfield (2003) ===
MSNBC news reporter [[Ashleigh Banfield]] delivered a Landon Lecture on April 24, 2003. Banfield used the forum to raise concerns regarding media coverage of the [[Iraq War]]. She spoke against "cable news operators who wrap themselves in the American flag and go after a certain target demographic" and specifically named [[Fox News Channel]] as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Banfield | first = Ashleigh | title=Banfield Landon Speech | publisher = ksu.edu Landon Lecture website | date = April 24, 2003 | url = http://www.k-state.edu/media/newsreleases/landonlect/banfieldtext403.html | accessdate = March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/15778/ |title=MSNBC's Banfield Slams War Coverage|first=Ashleigh |last=Banfield|date=28 April 2003|accessdate=30 April 2015|work=[[AlterNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' reported that her speech angered NBC management, who rebuked her and lowered her profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rutenberg|first=James|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/05/business/media/05ASH.html|title=Ashleigh Banfield's Career No Longer Seems to Shine as Bright|work=The New York Times|date=May 5, 2003|accessdate=March 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Timothy|last=Dumas|title=Truth and Consequences: Meet Ashleigh Banfield.

=== George W. Bush (2006) ===
On January 23, 2006, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] spoke at the Landon Lecture, one month after news reports broke the story of the U.S. government's warrantless wiretapping of telephone conversations in the United States. In his Landon Lecture, Bush gave the domestic wiretapping program the name of "[[Terrorist Surveillance Program]]" for the first time.&lt;ref name=Lichtblau/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fox follows Bush's lead, renames domestic spying program as "terrorist surveillance program" | publisher = mediamatters.org | date = January 31, 2006 | url = http://mediamatters.org/research/2006/01/31/fox-follows-bushs-lead-renames-domestic-spying/ | accessdate = March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Bush's speech, [[NPR]] aired a piece comparing Bush's Landon Lecture speech to Nixon's appearance in the series in 1970, noting both were defending their national security policies "as public discontent with a foreign war persists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gonyea | first = Don | title = Echoes of Nixon in Bush's Kansas State Speech? | newspaper = NPR | date = January 23, 2006 | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5167803 | accessdate = March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Logitech Harmony 1000 Remote.jpg|thumb|300px|Logitech Harmony 1000]]
'''Logitech Harmony''' is a line of [[remote control]]s and [[home automation]] products produced by [[Logitech]]. The line includes [[universal remote]] products designed for controlling the components of [[home cinema|home theater]] systems (including televisions, [[set-top box]]es, [[DVD player|DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] players, [[video game console]]s) and other devices that can be controlled via [[infrared]], as well as newer "Hub" products that can be used to additionally control supported [[Internet of things]] (IoT) and [[Smart home]] products, and allow the use of [[mobile app]]s to control devices.

==History==
The Harmony remote control was originally created in 2001 by Easy Zapper, a Canadian company, and first sold in November 2001.&lt;ref name="announcement"&gt;{{cite press release|title=New Harmony Universal Remote Links Home Entertainment to the Internet |publisher=Easy Zapper, Inc. |date=September 27, 2001 |url=//www.easyzapper.com/Harmony/PressRelease_20010927.asp |accessdate=2007-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020204104948/http://www.easyzapper.com/Harmony/PressRelease_20010927.asp |archivedate=February 4, 2002 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company later changed its name to Intrigue Technologies and was located in [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Computer peripheral manufacturer Logitech acquired it in May 2004 for US$29 million, turning Harmony remotes into a worldwide phenomenon.&lt;ref name="acquisition"&gt;{{cite press release
 | title = Logitech Acquires Intrigue Technologies, Maker of Acclaimed Harmony Remote Controls
 | publisher = Logitech
 | date = May 5, 2004
 | url = https://www.logitech.com/en-us/press/press-releases/1760
 | accessdate = 2017-11-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
All Harmony remotes prior to the 2015 Harmony Elite are set up online and retrieve settings via a computer's USB port. The 2015 Elite model introduced the ability to set up the remote with a mobile device app.{{CN|date=May 2016}}

Each remote has [[infrared| infrared (IR)]] learning capability (some later models also include RF support), and can upload information about a new remote to an online device database.  {{Asof|2012}} 5000+ brands of devices were supported.

All Harmony remotes support one-touch activity based control, which allows control of multiple devices at once. For example, a home theater setup might include a TV, a digital set top box and a home theater sound system. Pressing the 'Watch TV' activity button on the remote will turn on the TV, turn on digital set top box, turn on the sound system, switch the input of TV to the digital set top box and switch the input of the sound system to the set top box. In addition, the volume buttons would be mapped to the sound system, the channel buttons would be mapped to the digital set to box, and other controls to the most appropriate system component for the activity.

==Harmony Remote software==
The remote software allows users to update the remote configuration, learn IR commands, and upgrade the remote control's firmware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myremotesetup.com |title=Harmony remote software |publisher=Myremotesetup.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early versions of the remote software required a [[web browser]]; newer versions are Java-based. The software requires constant Internet connectivity while programming the remote, as remote control codes are downloaded from Logitech. This method allows updates to the product database, remote codes, and macro sequences to be easily distributed. This also allows Logitech to survey their market in order to determine products for investigation and research.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Harmony control software is available for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]]&lt;!--Following may be true but needs ref: however, the software is unstable and this model is not recommended--&gt;. A group of developers was working on Harmony Remote software for the [[Linux]] [[operating system]]; {{As of|2012|2|lc=yes}} the latest available release was dated August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phildev.net/concordance/ |title=Concordance Project |publisher=Phildev.net |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/congruity/ |title=Congruity Project |publisher=Sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 2010 Logitech launched a new website called "My Harmony" for setting up several later Harmony remote controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myharmony.com |title=Logitech "My Harmony" website (currently only supporting the Harmony 300,600,650,700) |publisher=Myharmony.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current products==
As of January 2017, the current products being sold in the Harmony line are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logitech.com/en-us/harmony-remotes|title=Harmony Remotes - Choose Your Harmony Remote|publisher=Logitech|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Harmony 350
The lowest-budget version of the Harmony remote, which can control up to 8 devices in particular categories, and supports only one activity: Watch TV. Unlike most current and former products in the Harmony line, this model lacks a display screen.

;Harmony 650
The lowest-cost version of the Harmony remote that contains a display screen, which is color. It can be programmed with multiple activities and up to 8 devices.

;Harmony Hub
This device is not a remote, but rather a hub that can control IR and Bluetooth devices, as well as certain smart home devices (e.g. Philips Hue, Nest thermostat). It is controlled by certain Harmony remotes as well iOS/Android based apps, and more recently Alexa can control certain functions. By itself, it can control up to 8 home theater devices and an amount of home automation devices. A lot of the current products include this along with the remote. This replaces the older Harmony Ultimate Hub, Harmony Home Hub and Harmony Link devices.

;Harmony Smart Control
Includes a Harmony Home Hub and a simple remote control that contains three activity buttons used to activate up to 6 different activities. The simple remote lacks a display screen, and can also be purchased separately for those who already own a Harmony Home Hub. Supports up to 8 devices.

;Harmony Companion (formerly Harmony Home Control)
Like the Harmony Smart Control described above, but the included Simple Remote also contains home automation controls. Like the Smart Control Simple Remote, the included remote lacks a display screen, but it cannot be purchased for Home Hub owners unlike the Smart Control remote.

;Harmony Smart Keyboard
This includes the Harmony Hub along with a keyboard containing a built-in trackpad. The keyboard appears to be like Logitech's previous K400 keyboard and trackpad combo, except some of the keys and buttons have been replaced with others more useful to a home theater remote, and two numbered, Harmony-specific USB receivers are included. It lacks a display screen, supports three activities (Watch a Movie, Watch TV, and Listen to Music), and can also be purchased as an add-on accessory for Harmony Home Hub owners. It controls up to 8 devices.

;Harmony Touch
The Harmony Touch remote control contains a full-color display screen with touch functionality. It is an IR remote that supports up to 15 devices and multiple activities. It lacks dedicated physical buttons for home automation control. This remote can be added to a Harmony Hub for additional functionality.

;Harmony Link
A device which utilizes a [[mobile app]] as a remote to control devices within the room. It has since been succeeded by the newer Harmony Hub product, which also supports controlling [[Smart home]] products. On November 8, 2017, Logitech announced that it would end support for the Harmony Link and make the devices inoperable after March 18, 2018, citing an expired security certificate for a component in the platform. Following criticism of Logitech's originally-announced plan to do so for users whose devices were still under warranty, Logitech announced on November 10, 2017 that it would exchange all Harmony Links for Harmony Hubs free-of-charge, regardless of warranty status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/after-online-outrage-logitech-will-now-replace-harmony-link-devices-for-free/|title=After online outrage, Logitech will now replace Harmony Link devices for free|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/logitech-to-shut-down-service-and-support-for-harmony-link-devices-in-2018/|title=Logitech to shut down “service and support” for Harmony Link devices in 2018 [Update]|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Harmony 500 series
The Harmony 500 remotes are mid-range remotes that is similar in functionality to the Harmony 659 and 670, but with different button arrangements and a squared-off physical design compared to the hourglass design of the 6xx series. Compared to today's offerings, these remotes offered control of up to 15 devices at an affordable price. The remotes have a back-lit monochrome LCD screen. The 500 series seems to be discontinued entirely.

;Harmony for Xbox 360
While it's marketed for the Xbox 360 segment, this remote must be said to be part of the 5xx series. It runs the same software. The Harmony 360 is pre-configured to be used with the [[Xbox 360]] console, and has special buttons, X, Y, A, B and media center control, correlating with the same as found on native Xbox controllers. It has a back-lit LCD screen and uses four AAA batteries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/remotes/universal_remotes/devices/375&amp;cl=us,en Harmony 360]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205132139/http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/remotes/universal_remotes/devices/375%26cl%3Dus%2Cen |date=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The hardware layout is mostly the same as the 550. The extra up/down arrows of the 550 is removed to make room for the colored X, Y, A and B buttons beneath the play and pause rows. This would make it the remote in the 500 series with the most hardware buttons, 54 (counting the four direction arrow keys). It can control up to 12 devices.

;Harmony 510/515
The Harmony 510/515 is an entry-level remote that is essentially a replacement to the 500 series and the Xbox 360 version. It has the same number of buttons as the 525 and features colored buttons typical on most satellite boxes. It has a four-button, monochrome LCD display. This remote is software limited to controlling up to five devices. Like its mid-range cousins, the 520 and 550, it has no recharge pod and uses AAA batteries instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/remotes/universal_remotes/devices/4738&amp;cl=us,en |title=Harmony 510 |publisher=Logitech.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409011109/http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/remotes/universal_remotes/devices/4738%26cl%3Dus%2Cen |archivedate=April 9, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous 500 series models, these newer models have been limited to 5 devices in software, yet sell for the same prices.

Difference between 510/515:
The 510 is black; the 515 is silver.

;Harmony 520/525
The Harmony 520 is a mid-range remote that is similar in functionality to the Harmony 659 and 670, but with a different button arrangement and a squared-off physical design compared to the hourglass design of the 6xx series. It has a blue back-light and monochrome LCD screen. These 5xx models are equipped with an infrared learning port to learn IR signals of unsupported or unknown devices. By pointing an original remote control at the Harmony's learning port, it is able to copy and reproduce those codes and, in the case of supported devices, it is able to figure out what the remote is used to control and imports that device. They require 4 AAA batteries.  A mini USB port is used to connect these to a computer for programming.

Difference between 520/525:
The 525 has 50 buttons, while the 520 has 46. It lacks the red, green, yellow and blue colour buttons commonly used for things like teletext and PVR control. Apparently, the 520 is the American model while the 525 is the European.  The 520 and 525 can control up to 12 and 15 devices respectively.

;Harmony 550/555
The harmony 550/555 remotes are variants of the 525 remote. Compared to the model 525, the 550 and 555 have two extra buttons, and are made of higher grade materials with different colors. The 550 and 555 models both have a sound and a picture button that changes the button mapping on the remote, allowing for reuse of the same physical buttons for different set of functionality. 52 buttons.

Difference between 550/555:
The 550 and 555 have the same number and placement of buttons, just with different mapping. The 555 have the same color buttons as the 525. The 550 does not, instead it has the following extra functions: Up arrow, Down arrow, A and B buttons. The 555 has orange back-light, the 550 has blue.

;Harman/Kardon TC 30
The [[Harman Kardon|Harman/Kardon]] TC 30 appears to be a redesigned, rebranded Harmony 52x with a cradle and a color LCD. The LCD has eight items compared to the four of the rest of the Harmony 5xx series. Images exist of the TC 30 both with and without the teletext color buttons. This might mean that there's one version based on the 520 and one based on the 525. The key layout is identical to the 52x remotes. It seems to require different software from the Logitech branded remotes&amp;nbsp;— however at the moment you can download this software from Logitech via harmonyremote.com.

;Harmony 610
The Harmony 610 is functionally identical to the Harmony 670 and Harmony 620, but comes in black with a silver face panel. The 610 can control a maximum of 5 devices.

;Harmony 620;	
The Harmony 620 is functionally identical to the Harmony 670, but comes in black instead of silver/black. The 670 can control up to 15 devices, where the 620 can only control 12 devices.

;Harmony 659;	
[[Image:Harmony 659.jpg|thumb|Harmony 659, an activity-based universal remote]]

;Harmony 720
The Harmony 720 was initially offered exclusively through [[Costco]]&lt;ref name="CNet Harmony 720 Review"&gt;[http://reviews.cnet.com/4531-10921_7-6538970.html CNet Harmony 720 Review]. Retrieved 09 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006 and featured a color screen and backlit keys. It was designed as an inexpensive competitor to the earlier Harmony 880, with few differences, except for the ergonomic design and key layout.&lt;ref name="CNet Harmony 720 Review"/&gt; It is now available through other vendors,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Harmony-720-Universal-Remote/dp/B000GD3J3G Amazon.com]. Retrieved 09 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; but remains unlisted on Logitech's product page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/remotes/universal_remotes/&amp;cl=us,en Logitech Universal Remotes]. Retrieved 09 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The harmony 720 remote is closely related to the 500 series, as it has a square shape and a layout akin to those remotes. When compared to the 525, you will find the same buttons above the LCD. The 720 has a colour LCD with six buttons/activities instead of four. The eight play/stop etc. buttons have been moved to the lower part. The Mute and Prev buttons have been moved and in their place, there are extra up and down buttons&amp;nbsp;— same as on the 550. Compared to the 500 series, the glow button has been removed. These remotes do not have the Sound and Picture buttons to change key mappings, like the 550/555 remotes does. Lacking red, green, yellow and blue colour buttons, the 720 has 49 buttons. It can control up to 12 devices.

;Harmony 785
The harmony 785 is nearly identical to the 720. While the 720 has 49 buttons, the 785 has 53. The extra buttons are the red, green, yellow and blue colour buttons commonly used for things like teletext and PVR control. These are located above the number buttons, which are placed further down compared to the 720. Another difference from the 720 is that the 785 can control up to 15 devices.

;Harmony 880/885
The Harmony 880 was the first Harmony with a color LCD screen and a rechargeable battery. The Harmony 885 remote has extra buttons as mentioned below. The 885 replaces up and down keys with four color keys used for Teletext and, more recently, by some set-top boxes.

There was a short-lived 880Pro that had the picture and sound buttons. This remote did not feature multi-room/multi-controller support like the 890Pro.

{Yet to Add}:  Difference between 880/885:
The 885 has the red, green, yellow and blue colour buttons commonly used for things like teletext and PVR control. These four buttons occupy the same space where the 880 has two selection buttons (up arrow, down arrow).

;Harmony 890/895
The Harmony 890/895 is the same as the 880/885, but it adds [[radio frequency]] (RF) capability, enabling the remote to control devices even without line-of-sight to and from different rooms, up to a range of 30 meters. This remote control cannot control proprietary RF devices, but it can control special [[Z-Wave]] RF devices, as well as IR devices without line-of-sight via the RF extender.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/remotes/universal_remotes/devices/374&amp;cl=gb,en Logitech Harmony 895 Advanced Universal Remote]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218090509/http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/remotes/universal_remotes/devices/374%26cl%3Dgb%2Cen |date=December 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support-downloads/downloads/universal-remotes/devices/374 Logitech Harmony 890 Advanced Universal Remote]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 890Pro adds multi-room and multi-controller support, as well as a different color scheme. (Primary and secondary remotes can be set up that work with the same wireless extender) It also adds two buttons&amp;nbsp;— picture and sound&amp;nbsp;— that allow for quick access to picture- and sound-related commands. It is not listed on the Logitech Web site and is sold through custom installation companies. The 890Pro is not shipped with the RF extender.

{Yet to Add}:  Difference between 890/895:

;Harmony 1000

;Harmony 900
Harmony 900 has the same ergonomics design as Harmony One. It has additional four color buttons compared to Harmony One and RF supported. The RF technology used by Harmony 900 is not comparable with Harmony 890, 1000, and 1100. The Harmony 900 and 1100 models do not support "sequences" (Logitech parlance for [[Macro (computer science)|macros]]).

;Harmony 1100

==Cinematic Style==

'''Boswell’s''' work is sometimes noted for its elliptical montage structure featuring a wild concoction of appropriated film materials coupled with his own production footage. Another aspect of this process is his usage of subtitles over original scenes from iconic films that leads toward an entirely different storyline.

During the 2009 '''Cambridge Film Festival''' in England the British film critic '''Laura J Smith''' wrote: He refers to his work as “Nova-Kino” a pertinent cinematic theory for filmmakers and media artists alike who, as '''Boswell''' describes, “utilise found footage as source material to be re-edited or re-animated, giving radical rebirth or second life in their reconstructed state.” A vital element of Nova-Kino is “the usage of critical, political, and other highly charged points of view embedded within the structure of the work that challenge hegemonic power structures at large or in more specific realms.” By no accident, these aesthetics are undeniably similar to those of Agit-Prop cinema, which '''Boswell''' labels “the eternal bi-product of the Russian Revolution.” &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20131227202729/http://www.cambridgefilmfestival.org.uk/news/irrationality-over-rationality=]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Helsinki 2003 during the Avanto Festival, for the European premiere of his first feature film"'''The Subversion Agency"'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2118003/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1=]&lt;/ref&gt; – the Finnish film critic '''Manu Haapalainen''' wrote: The black and white film feels and looks like a version of '''Francis Ford Coppola's "The Conversation"''', set in Cuba, directed by '''Jean-Luc Godard''' and scripted by '''William Burroughs'''. The film's intricate and non-linear plot has to do with the adventures of an American arms dealer in a perplexing country called K-Zone. K-Zone is like a cross between Cuba and a kind of socialist America imaginable only in an alternative reality. "'''The Subversion Agency'''" is an extremely stylish work on the level of both image and sound. The aged, grainy archival material has been allowed to dictate the visual look of the whole film. The soundtrack of "'''The Subversion Agency'''" is chock full of something resembling electronic music, hissing sounds, beeps and interferences. The film's narrative is repeatedly interrupted by auditive and visual discontinuities and disturbances. The experience is voyeuristic and somewhat enigmatic.

==Nova-Kino Manifesto==

'''Nova-Kino''' is an experimental cinematic movement with departure points from the Russian twenties, film noir, situationism, the classical avant-garde, and post-modern appropriationist theory. The movement is blatantly left with variations of classical anarchism, situationism and Marxist paranoia of unrestrained capitalism.
'''Nova-Kino''' is a technologically advanced medium that incorporates digital, celluloid, analog, and pseudo-redundant motion picture technologies that en somme, actualize the free market mantra of "the democratization of technology."
'''Nova-Kino's''' fire-brand critique of Capitalism, Americanism, and Technotopia will make its acceptance into the traditional venues of exhibition, distribution, and production DIFFICULT - but not impossible.
'''Nova-Kino''' is an investigation into the political structure of the past, present, and future. It does not operate under any sequential formula. Therefore, it is a Buddhist attack on the narrative structure of History. However, unlike the old guard/avant-garde, Nova-Kino wholeheartedly embraces the telling of "stories." '''Nova-Kino''' is therefore the simultaneous raconteur of the past and prophet of the present.
'''Nova-Kino''' does not recognize the traditional property rights of the West. More specifically, the further Hollywood advances its tautological consumerism on Society, the further WE attack! '''Nova-Kino''' is like an Indian Casino; paradoxical, autonomous, and ultimately wise...

The '''Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance''' ('''OCRT''') is a group in [[Kingston, Ontario]] dedicated to the promotion of [[religious tolerance]] through their website, '''ReligiousTolerance.org'''.&lt;ref name=Euth /&gt;

== History of the group and its website ==
Bruce A. Robinson, who is described as the "chief architect" of the organization, has presented a history of the group and its website in the book ''Religion on the Internet: Research Prospects and Promises'' (edited by [[Jeffrey K. Hadden]] and [[Douglas E. Cowan]]).&lt;ref name="sra"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lewis, James P.|title=Satanism Today: An Encyclopedia Of Religion, Folklore and Popular Culture|publisher=ABC-Clio Inc|location=|year=2001|pages=242, 244|isbn=1-57607-292-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the group  consisted of an [[Agnosticism|Agnostic]], an [[Atheism|Atheist]], a [[Christianity|Christian]], a [[Wicca]]n and a [[Zen]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]].&lt;ref name="Euth"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jennifer Fecio McDougall|author2=Martha Gorman|author3=Carolyn S. Roberts|title=Euthanasia: a reference handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AKaVqvPwkq0C|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-121-3|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AKaVqvPwkq0C&amp;pg=PA222 222]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeling that much of the information spread about religious minorities was inaccurate, the group created its ReligiousTolerance.org website in an attempt to explain the nature of these beliefs.&lt;ref name="Metro"&gt;Klein, Sarah (October 25, 2006). [http://metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=9777 "The kinder, gentler Satanist. The devil sells out, moves to suburbia and dons a fluffy bunny suit"], ''[[Metro Times]]''. Retrieved on January 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Satanism]], Wicca, other [[Neopagan]] religions and [[New Age]] were some of the first belief systems they focused on.&lt;ref name="Metro"/&gt; The site has hosted over eight thousand articles devoted to the description of numerous religions and religious controversies.&lt;ref name="Euth"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2011}}&lt;ref name=stover/&gt;&lt;ref name="week"/&gt;

The group has stated that religious tolerance does not mean having to accept that the beliefs of others are true, or will lead to the same God, but rather it means according to others the right to choose their beliefs without being oppressed or discriminated against: "We can believe that members of another religious group are hopelessly deluded, and still support their right to enjoy religious freedom".&lt;ref name="week"&gt;Staff (September 15, 2001). "Web Site of the Week", ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Having originally begun as an informal group, the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance were registered as a sole proprietorship in 1996, one year after the website had first been made available online.&lt;ref name="Metro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="religionnet"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cowan, Douglas E.|author2=Hadden, Jeffrey K|title=Religion on the Internet: research prospects and promises|publisher=Jai|location=Amsterdam|year=2000|pages=312, 311|isbn=0-7623-0535-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his writings on the website, Robinson has also contributed a chapter on "[[Satanic Ritual Abuse]]" to ''The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions'' (2001), edited by [[James R. Lewis (writer)|James R. Lewis]].&lt;ref name="sra"/&gt;

== Reception ==
In ''Dimensions of Human Behavior'', Elizabeth D. Hutchison described Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance as "an agency that promotes religious tolerance as a [[human right]]".&lt;ref name="Hutch"&gt;Hutchison, Elizabeth D. (2003). ''Dimensions of Human Behavior'', SAGE, {{ISBN|0-7619-8765-7}}, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Teaching New Religious Movements'' (2007), [[David G. Bromley]] has listed ReligiousTolerance.org among recommended secondary research sources on [[new religious movements]] to be used in concert with movement and countermovement sources.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, David G. (2007). ''Teaching New Religious Movements'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-517729-0}}, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Moore, a scholar teaching Religious Studies at [[San Diego State University]], described the ReligiousTolerance.org website as a "massive education program" and she expressed regret that her students dismissed the site at first because it supported itself with advertising.&lt;ref name=stover&gt;Stover, Mark (2001). ''Theological Librarians and the Internet'', Haworth Press, {{ISBN|0-7890-1342-8}}, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 online literacy guide (''IssueWeb: A Guide and Sourcebook for Researching Controversial Issues on the Web'') has listed ReligiousTolerance.org as a suggested research resource on [[abortion]], [[assisted suicide]], religious tolerance, [[gay rights]] and [[hate group]]s/[[hate crime]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz, Karen R.; O'Hanlon, Nancy (2005). ''IssueWeb: A Guide and Sourcebook for Researching Controversial Issues on the Web'', [[Libraries Unlimited]], {{ISBN|1-59158-078-1}}, pp. 40, 55, 67, 120, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' noted in 2002 that access to the site was blocked to Internet users in [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kristof, Nicholas D.]] (January 11, 2002). [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E3DF1F3FF932A35752C1A9649C8B63 Can This Marriage Be Saved?], ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Postgraduate Research Experience Survey (PRES)''' is a survey amongst graduate students at universities in the United Kingdom. It is developed by the [[Higher Education Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Postgraduate Research Experience Survey (PRES)|url=http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/pres|author=The Higher Education Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participating institutions can collect feedback on the student experience and benchmark against their peers. The data is shared in a way so that comparisons (with the national average, for instance) are possible, but league tables cannot be constructed. The aim is to enhance the student experience. 

The equivalent for graduate students on taught courses is the Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey (PTES).

'''Preply''' is an [[online]] [[educational technology]] platform which pairs [[student]]s with private [[tutor]]s, either locally in-person or remotely via [[Skype]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5919">Professor '''Robin Pedley''' (11 August 1914 - 20 November 1988) was a British [[education]]ist whose publication laid much of the foundations of [[Comprehensive school|comprehensive education]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Early life==
He was born '''Robert Pedley''' to Edward Pedley, [[Stonemasonry|stonemason]], and wife Martha, a [[Postmaster|postmistress]]; he was the third of four sons and a daughter. He was raised in [[Grinton]], near [[Reeth]], in the then [[North Riding]] of [[Yorkshire]], and went to the local Fremington School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/rd/249108e4-e027-49d7-9802-d709bb18fe63 Fremington School]&lt;/ref&gt; and then Reeth Friends School under head teacher Reginald Place &lt;ref&gt; the sun rises and sets by John Place &lt;/ref&gt;. He was a [[Student teacher|pupil teacher]] until the system was abolished in 1928.

Pedley won an Ellerton Scholarship to [[Durham University]], where he graduated with an upper-second in History and Economics in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pedley, Robin [formerly Robert] (1914–1988), educationist |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-39992?rskey=ZePYL1&amp;result=14 |website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |accessdate=20 September 2018 |language=en |}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gained his teaching certificate the following year, followed by a doctorate in 1939 - which he wrote on the political and economic history of the northern [[Pennines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pedley, Robin [formerly Robert] (1914–1988), educationist |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-39992?rskey=ZePYL1&amp;result=14 |website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |accessdate=20 September 2018 |language=en |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From 1936 to 1938 he was a Research Fellow at the University of Durham. In 1937 he won the Gladstone Prize for Modern History and, in the same year, the Gibson Prize for Archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pedley, Robin [formerly Robert] (1914–1988), educationist |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-39992?rskey=ZePYL1&amp;result=14 |website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |accessdate=20 September 2018 |language=en |}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1938 to 1942 he taught History at [[Great Ayton Friends' School]], a Quaker independent boarding school. During the [[Second World War]] he was a [[conscientious objector]]. From 1946 to 1947 he taught Education at the College of St Mark &amp; St John in London, now the [[University of St Mark &amp; St John]].

===University of Leicester===
From 1947 to 1963 he worked in the Department of Education at the [[University of Leicester]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fo2VrTOld1QC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24 Leicestershire]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the University he began to develop his ideas on comprehensive schools, which he had visited from the early 1950s. By 1963 there were 175 comprehensive schools in England; around 5% of secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'' obituary, 24 November 1988, page 18&lt;/ref&gt; He believed, as did some others later on, that comprehensive schools helped social integration, and helped underprivileged children. He believed the [[grammar school]] system led to segregated education.

He believed in small schools in intimate communities, and did not like ''all-through'' schools from ages 11 to 19. He preferred two stages of secondary schools, from ages 11 to 15, then ages 15 to 19.

===University of Exeter===
From 1963 to 1971 he was Director of the Institute of Education at the [[University of Exeter]], becoming a Professor in 1970.

===University of Southampton===
From 1971 to 1975 he was Head (Professor) of the School of Education and Dean of the Faculty of Education at the [[University of Southampton]].

==Publications==
* ''Comprehensive Schools Today'', 1955
* ''Comprehensive Education: a new approach'', 1956
* ''The Comprehensive School'', 1963 (3rd edition, 1978), [[Pelican Books]]; his most influential book, greatly popularising the idea of comprehensive schools.
* ''The Comprehensive School'', 1966
* ''Towards the Comprehensive University'', 1977

==Personal life==
He married in Leicester in 1951 and had a son (born 1953)&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/13714/1/Thesis-1989-Pedley.pdf His son's 1989 education PhD at Loughborough University]&lt;/ref&gt; and a daughter (born 1955). His son worked for an [[examination board]]. In his later life he lived at [[Brockenhurst]], [[Hampshire]]. He died aged 74 in [[Wiltshire]].

His daughter married in March 1984 in the [[New Forest District]]. His son married in July 1998 in the New Forest District. His son had a daughter in June 1998, and a son in December 2001 (named after his father). His son married a Dutch woman, and lived at [[Castle Ashby]] in [[Northamptonshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/XaQJEiKJhotvE5HdI73f_BP9ZgE/appointments His son - Companies House]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SEED''', also known as '''Schlumberger Excellence in Educational Development''', is a global non-profit educational outreach organization within [[Schlumberger Limited]], the global oilfield services company.

The mission of SEED is to inspire, influence and enable educators in underserved communities where Schlumberger people live and work to engage youth in science and technology. SEED aims to build learning communities and knowledge-sharing environments in which students, educators and volunteers collaborate on projects in their local languages.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==History==
SEED was founded in 1998 "to help bridge the [[digital divide]]" by providing science knowledge and technology (computer and Internet resources) to underserved communities around the world where the company's employees lived and work. The acronym SEED,which stands for Schlumberger Excellence in Educational Development, describes the nascent enterprise of providing volunteer support and technology to Schlumberger communities.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} SEED signed its first agreement with a school in Venezuela to launch a pilot program and soon thereafter outfitted the school with computers, Internet service and volunteers who provided technical support.

Over the ensuing years, SEED expanded internationally. In 2003, SEED began hosting hands-on educational workshops to advance the SEED focus on experiential learning. In 2006, SEED changed the name of its Connectivity Grant Program to the School Network Program (SNP) to more accurately reflect its work and relationships with granted educational institutions. In 2007, during its 10th operating year, SEED signed its 200th SNP grant contract, again with a school in Venezuela, and in 2008, SEED entered its 40th country.

SEED has ongoing collaborations with the [[MIT Media Lab]], iEARN, [[MaMaMedia]], Professional Thinking Partners (SmartWired), Milton Glaser Inc., [[OLPC]] (One Laptop Per Child) and the [[Society for Organizational Learning]] (SoL), among other educational organizations.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''Scott Barry Kaufman''' (born June 3, 1979) is an American psychologist, author, and popular science writer known for his research and writing on intelligence and creativity. Most media attention has focused on Kaufman's attempt to redefine intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.hbr.org/ideacast/2013/06/why-we-need-to-redefine-intell.html Why We Need to Redefine Intelligence], Harvard Business Review IdeaCast, 13 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/2013/jun/13/redefining-intelligence/ Redefining Intelligence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618202416/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/2013/jun/13/redefining-intelligence/ |date=2013-06-18 }}, The Leonard Lopate Show- WNYC, 13 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcocreate.com/1683207/beyond-iq-5-ways-to-reframe-success-and-smarts Beyond IQ: 5 Ways to Reframe Success and Smarts], Fast Co.Create, 13 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman is Scientific Director of The Imagination Institute in the Positive Psychology Center &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ppc.sas.upenn.edu Positive Psychology Center]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He is also co-founder of The Creativity Post &lt;ref&gt;[http://creativitypost.com The Creativity Post]&lt;/ref&gt; and author of "Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined".&lt;ref name="Ungifted"&gt;''Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined'' (2013). New York, NY: Basic Books. ({{ISBN|0-465-02554-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman won the 2011 Daniel E. Berlyne Award from Division 10 of the [[American Psychological Association]] for outstanding research on aesthetics, creativity, and the arts by a junior scholar,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/divisions/div10/awards.html Berlyne Award], Division 10, American Psychological Association,&lt;/ref&gt; and is a 2011-2012 recipient of the [[Mensa International]] Award for Excellence in Research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mensafoundation.org/what-we-do/awards-and-recognition/awards-for-excellence-in-research/afe-winners1/winners-2010-20111/ Awards for Excellence in Research winners, 2011-2012] Mensa Education &amp; Research Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; He is listed on [[Business Insider]] as one of the "50 groundbreaking scientists who are changing the way we see the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Science |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/50-scientists-changing-the-world-2015-7 |title=50 scientists changing the world |publisher=Business Insider |date=2015-07-14 |accessdate=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

After graduating from [[Lower Merion High School]] in 1998, Kaufman received his B.S. from [[Carnegie Mellon University]], where he was Nobel Prize Winner [[Herbert A. Simon]]'s last research assistant, and a student of [[Randy Pausch]]. In 2005, he received his M.Phil. from [[King's College, Cambridge]] under a [[Gates Scholarship]], where he worked with [[Nicholas Mackintosh]]. After Cambridge, Kaufman earned his Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from [[Yale University]] where he was mentored by [[Robert Sternberg]], Jeremy R. Gray, and Jerome L. Singer. From 2009-2010, he was a post-doctoral fellow at the [[Center Leo Apostel for Interdisciplinary Studies]].

== Personal ==

Kaufman is the grandson of former Philadelphia Orchestra cellist [[Harry Gorodetzer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2003-04-13/news/25475880_1_scholarship-winners-melinda-gates-foundation-gates-program Gates scholarship backs quest of L. Merion alum Studying at Cambridge for a year could bring progress in how human intelligence is measured.], The Philadelphia Inquirer, 13 April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200911/genius-genes-and-gusto-how-passions-find-you Genius, Genes and Gusto: How Passions Find You], Psychology Today, 1 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2002-12-23/news/25359530_1_leopold-stokowski-school-orchestra-orchestra-director Harry Gorodetzer, former Phila. Orchestra cellist. The Philadelphia Inquirer, 23 December 2002].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Kaufman's research focuses on the measurement and development of intelligence and creativity, with a consideration of implications for education, business, and society. Kaufman has over 40 scientific papers in numerous books and journals, including ''Cognition'', ''Intelligence'', and the ''[[Journal of Creative Behavior]]''. He is also editor of ''The Philosophy of Creativity'' (with Elliot Samuel Paul, Oxford, 2014), ''The Complexity of Greatness: Beyond Talent or Practice'' (Oxford, 2013), ''The Cambridge Handbook of Intelligence'' (with [[Robert Sternberg]], Cambridge, 2011), and ''The Psychology of Creative Writing'' (with [[James C. Kaufman]], Cambridge, 2009).

== The dual-process theory of human intelligence ==

Most theories of human [[intelligence]] and tests of intelligence emphasize controlled and deliberate reasoning as the hallmark of human intelligence. While agreeing that such thought processes are an important component of intelligence, Kaufman argues that spontaneous forms of thinking such as [[insight]], imaginative play, [[daydreaming]], [[implicit learning]], and a reduced [[latent inhibition]] are also important contributors to a wide range of intelligent behaviors as well as creative greatness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201402/dreams-glory Dreams of Glory], Psychology Today, March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beautiful-minds/201102/why-daydreamers-are-more-creative Why Daydreamers Are More Creative], Beautiful Minds, 27 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Integrating modern dual-process theories of cognition with research on human [[intelligence]], Kaufman proposed the dual-process theory of human intelligence.&lt;ref name="dissertation"&gt;Kaufman, S. B. (2009). Beyond general intelligence: The dual-process theory of human intelligence (Unpublished Ph.D. dissertation). Yale University, New Haven, CT.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="implicit cognition"&gt;Kaufman, S.B. (2011). Intelligence and the cognitive unconscious. In R.J. Sternberg &amp; S.B. Kaufman (Eds.), The Cambridge Handbook of Intelligence (pp. 442-467). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="contemporary theories of intelligence"&gt;Kaufman, J.C., Kaufman, S.B., &amp; Plucker, J.A. (2013). Contemporary theories of intelligence. In J. Reisberg (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Psychology (pp. 811-822). New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201104/6-clues-character 6 Clues to Character], Psychology Today, 15 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory emphasizes the importance of adaptation to task demands as the essence of intelligent functioning. At the same time, the theory takes into account an individual's personal goals and accommodates a wide range of intelligent behaviors in a wide range of fields, from the arts to the sciences. A key assumption of the theory is that abilities are not static entities but are constantly changing throughout the life span as the person continually engages with controlled and spontaneous modes of thought. In ''Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined'', Kaufman makes the point that his theory is also fundamentally developmental, because it views intelligence as the dynamic interplay of engagement and ability over time in the pursuit of personal goals. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativitypost.com/psychology/book_review_ungifted_intelligence_redefined Book Review - Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined], ''Creativity Post'', June 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this conceptualization, personal characteristics such as passion, [[growth mindset]], and [[Persistence (psychology)|persistence]] are also essential elements of human intelligence.

== Well-being ==
Kaufman sees [[well-being]] as influenced by [[happiness]] and meaning.&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-differences-between-happiness-and-meaning-in-life/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Note: Some ages vary because of the child's birth year.''


In [[Scotland]], students transfer from primary to secondary education at 11 or 12 years old. Pupils usually attend the same secondary school as their peers, as all secondaries have 'intake primaries'. Pupils attend either a [[Roman Catholic]] or [[non-denominational]] school according to their family's beliefs. Pupils in Scotland attend the same secondary school throughout their education; no [[sixth form colleges]] operate in Scotland, as in other [[country|countries]] in the United Kingdom.

The first and second years of secondary school ''(abbreviated to [[Senior 1|S1]] and [[Senior 2|S2]])'' are a continuation of the [[Curriculum for Excellence]] started in primary school, after which no set national approach is established. [[Third year|S3]] is still considered to be with the Broad General Education (or BGE) phase. Some schools allow students to start to narrow their field of study, with exceptions for compulsory subjects such as English and Mathematics. In [[Fourth year|S4]], students undertake 6–9 subjects called Nationals, and at this stage, students tend to be presented at levels 3–5. Nationals should take one year to complete. National 3 has no external exam. National 4 and National 5 however are levels that start external exams. Some National 5 &amp; 4 qualifications, such as Physical Education, also have no external exam. Rarely, [[Fourth year|S4]] pupils take a class that could be a higher class.

After these qualifications, some students leave to gain employment or attend [[Further education colleges in Scotland|further education colleges]]; however these days most students study for [[Highers]], of which five are usually studied. These take a year to complete, after which some students apply to university or stay on for [[Senior 6|S6]], where other Highers are gained, or [[Advanced Highers]] are studied. Due to the nature of schooling in Scotland, undergraduate honours degree programmes are four years long as matriculation is normally at the completion of Highers in [[Senior 5|S5]] (age 16–17), which compares with three years for the rest of the UK. As well as instruction through the English language, [[Gaelic medium education in Scotland|Gaelic medium education]] is also available throughout Scotland.

The vast majority of Scottish pupils take [[Scottish Qualifications Certificate]] qualifications provided by the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] (SQA). Until 2013/2014, most pupils took [[Standard Grade]]s (but some schools offered Intermediates instead) in [[Third year|S3]]-[[Fourth year|S4]], and [[Higher (Scottish)|Highers]] in S5. For those who wish to remain at school for the final year [[Sixth Year|(S6)]], more Highers and [[Advanced Higher]]s (formerly [[CSYS]]) in S6 could be taken. [[Intermediate 1]] and [[Intermediate 2]] qualifications – which were intended to be roughly equivalent to General and Credit Level Standard Grades respectively, but in practice (although they may vary from subject to subject), Intermediate 1 was easier than General, and Intermediate 2 harder than Credit – could also be taken in lieu of any of the aforementioned qualifications.

Pupils can go to university at the end of [[Fifth year|S5]], as Highers provide the entry requirements for Scottish universities. In recent times, it is more common for students to remain until [[Sixth Year|S6]], taking further Highers and/or taking Advanced Highers.

All educational qualifications in Scotland are part of the [[Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework]].

===National qualifications===
From 2013 to 2014, Intermediates 1, 2 and Access 1–3 ceased to be in use. These qualifications were replaced by National qualifications that are designed to fit in with the Scottish Government's "Curriculum for Excellence" system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/Schools/curriculum/qualifications|title=National Qualifications|last=ceu@scotland.gsi.gov.uk|first=Scottish Government, St. Andrew's House, Regent Road, Edinburgh EH1 3DG Tel:0131 556 8400|date=1 April 2003|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television series==
The StoryBots franchise's inaugural original TV series, ''[[Ask the StoryBots]]'', premiered on [[Netflix]] on August 12, 2016. The show, which follows the StoryBots characters of Beep, Boop, Bing, Bang and Bo (a.k.a. "Answer Team 341B") as they go on adventures into the human world to help answer kids' biggest questions, stars [[Judy Greer]] and includes guest appearances from [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Jay Leno]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], [[Kevin Smith]], [[Garfunkel and Oates]], [[Tim Meadows]] and [[Chris Parnell]]. ''Ask the StoryBots'' received critical acclaim for its educational quality and entertainment value for both parents and children. The show also spawned a soundtrack available on [[Spotify]], [[Apple Music]], [[ITunes]] and [[Amazon.com]].

A companion series, ''[[StoryBots Super Songs]]'', premiered on October 7, 2016, also on Netflix. While each episode of ''Ask the StoryBots'' featured the lead characters answering a child's single question, ''StoryBots Super Songs'' focuses on broader topics, such as outer space, colors, shapes and dinosaurs, through music and live-action vignettes with real children.&lt;ref name="blog.storybots.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.storybots.com/2016/10/07/theyre-back-all-new-storybots-tv-series-premieres-today/|title=They’re Back! All-New StoryBots TV Series Premieres Today|date=2016-10-07|website=StoryBots Blog|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ask the StoryBots'' also spun-off a holiday special, [[A StoryBots Christmas]], which premiered December 1, 2017, on Netflix. Featuring a guest appearance by [[Ed Asner]] as [[Santa Claus]], the special received two [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s, including Outstanding Special Class Animated Program.

== Awards ==
Since its founding in 2012, StoryBots has won numerous awards for its digital content, including the Teachers' Choice Award from ''Learning Magazine'', Parent's Choice Award, a Family Choice Award, Tech Edvocate Award, and an Editor's Choice Award from Children's Technology Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://childrenstech.com/blog/archives/11893|title=StoryBots Tap &amp; Sing {{!}} Children's Technology Review|website=childrenstech.com|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For its television work including ''[[Ask the StoryBots]]'' and ''[[A StoryBots Christmas]]'', StoryBots has won three [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s (with nine additional nominations), as well as recognition from the [[Annie Award]]s, [[British Academy Children's Awards]] and [[Peabody Award]]s.

'''Stress in medical students''' is [[Stress (biology)|stress]] caused by strenuous medical programs, which may have physical and psychological effects on the well-being of medical students. Excessive stress in medical training predisposes students for difficulties in solving interpersonal conflicts as a result of previous stress. A significant percentage of medical students suffer from anxiety disorders because of the long term effects of stress on emotional and behavioral [[symptomatology]]. This condition has become a focus of concern nationally and globally, therefore the first line of detection and defense from stress are the students themselves. Students need to be given the tools to recognize and cope with stress, as well as being assured that they will not suffer judgment from others for recognizing their need for help in dealing with stress. The instructors, advisers and other faculty members who notice the signs of stress in a student need to approach the student in a non-threatening, non-judgmental way, in an effort to help medical students recognize and handle their stress.

==Causes==
Stress is defined as an imbalance between environmental conditions necessary for survival and the ability of individuals to adapt to those conditions. Stress in medical students has been recognized for a long time. Many studies have explored the causes, consequences and solutions. There are three issues considered to be the most relevant, in terms of stress development in medical students. They are required to learn a great deal of new information in a short period of time before taking exams and evaluations. Therefore, they have little to no time to review what they have learned.&lt;ref name=Yusoff&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yussof |first1=M |last2=Baba |first2=A |year=2013 |title= Prevalence and associated factors of stress, anxiety and depression among prospective medical students|journal= Asian Journal of Psychiatry |volume= 6|issue=2 |pages=128–133|pmid=23466109 |doi=10.1016/j.ajp.2012.09.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical students are overloaded with a tremendous amount of information. They have a limited amount of time to memorize all the information studied. The overload of information creates a feeling of disappointment because of the inability to handle all the information at once and succeed during the examination period. Many medical students struggle with their own capacity to meet the demands of medical curriculum.&lt;ref name=Yusoff/&gt;

Stress responses to different situations vary at different [[levels of consciousness]], [[psychological stress]], and [[physiological stress]]. These points of stress may be interrelated, and each may be at a different level.&lt;ref name=VanDulmen&gt;{{cite journal |last1=VanDulmen |first1=S |last2=Trompb |first2=F |year=2007 |title= The impact of assessing simulated bad news consultations on medical students stress response and communication performance |journal= Psychoneuroendocrinology|volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=943–950 |doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2007.06.016|pmid=17689196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people believe that the most stressful period of a medical student's academic career is the gap between graduation from medical school and being board eligible in a medical specialty. The Resident Service Committee of the Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine (APDIM) divided the common stressors of residency into three categories: situational, personal, and professional.&lt;ref name=Ray&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ray |first1=I |last2=Joseph |first2=D |year=2010 |title= Stress in medical students |journal=JK Science |volume=12|issue=4 |pages=163–164 |url=http://www.jkscience.org/archive/volume124/Stress%20in%20Medical%20Students.pdf|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Situational stressors include inordinate hours, [[sleep deprivation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waqas|first1=Ahmed|title=Association of academic stress with sleeping difficulties in medical students of a Pakistani medical school: a cross sectional survey|journal=PeerJ|date=2015|volume=3|pages=e840|doi=10.7717/peerj.840|pmid=25802809|url=https://peerj.com/articles/840/|pmc=4369327}}&lt;/ref&gt; excessive workload, overbearing clerical and administrative responsibilities, inadequate support from allied health professionals, a large number of difficult patients, and conditions for learning that are less than optimal.&lt;ref name=Ray/&gt;  Second year students experience other stress situations because they start to interact with the patients. These interactions include stressful situations, like the delivery of bad news.&lt;ref name=VanDulmen/&gt;

Personal stressors include family, friend and relationship issues. Financial issues are common, as many residents carry heavy educational debts, and they feel compelled to hold a secondary job in order to repay their debts. Isolation is frequently exacerbated by relocation away from family and friends. Other stressors include limited free time to relax or develop new support systems, psycho-social concerns brought by the stress of residency, and inadequate coping skills. Professional stressors include responsibility for patient care, supervision of more junior residents and students, difficult patients, information overload and career planning.&lt;ref name=Ray/&gt;

==Effects==
Excessive amounts of stress in medical training predisposes students for difficulties in solving interpersonal conflicts, [[sleeping disorders]], decreased attention, reduced concentration, temptation to cheat on exams, depression, loss of objectivity, increased incidence of errors, and improper behavior such as negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Khan, Rida|author2=Lin, Jamie S.|author3=Mata, Douglas A.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0643|title=Addressing Depression and Suicide Among Physician Trainees|date=1 August 2015|journal=JAMA Psychiatry|volume=72|issue=8|page=848|doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0643|pmid=26107398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, stress in medical students can break the stability of the student's health and result in illness.

A recent study among German medical students at international universities displayed the significantly higher risk of depression symptoms being 2.4 times higher than the average population. 23.5% of these German medical students showed clinically relevant depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Kamiar-K. Rueckert|year=2016|title=Depression and Quality of Life in German Medical Students At Foreign Universities|conference=RSU International Conference Health and Social Science|page= 168|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.3727.0008|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298419251_Quality_of_Life_and_Depression_in_German_Medical_Students_at_Foreign_Universities }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A meta-analysis in the American journal ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' suggested depressive symptoms in 21% to 43% of all medical students.&lt;ref name=Mata/&gt;

The students make an effort to counteract the impact of stressful situations with various coping skills. The coping includes both cognitive and behavioral efforts against the problem of stress encountered during examinations.&lt;ref name=An&gt;{{cite journal |last1=An |first1=H |last2=Chunga |first2=S |year=2012 |title= Novelty-seeking and avoidance of coping strategies are associated with academic stress in Korean medical students |journal= Psychiatry Research |volume=200 |issue=16 |pages=464–468 |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2012.07.048 |pmid=22901439}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical students who fail to manage their stress levels have a tendency to be less competent in their work. Students who do not manage the time limits of examinations well lack time for exercise and social interactions because those two points are more stressful than the perceived discrimination on the course or the death of patients.&lt;ref name=ORourke/&gt;

==Physical effects==
Stress levels have a strong relationship with physical condition.&lt;ref name=ORourke/&gt; Medical students during an examination period can experience insomnia, fatigue, and nausea. Moreover, metabolism is disturbed by diarrhea or constipation. Skin diseases, including acne, dermatitis, and psoriasis, are common during the examination period. These symptoms are provoked by long working hours and the tension of completing the courses with good grades.&lt;ref name=Rizvi&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rizvi |first1=A |year=2010 |title= Pre-examination stress in second year medical students in a government college|pmid=21702291 |volume=22 |journal=J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad |pages=152–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical students have been known to consume caffeinated beverages to be active and alert during time of studying. These students drink large quantities of coffee, tea, cola, and [[energy drink]]s. Though an increased intake of caffeine can increase the levels of [[adenosine]], [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]], [[cortisol]] and dopamine in the blood, caffeine also inhibits the absorption of some nutrients, increasing the acidity of the gastrointestinal tract and depleting the levels of calcium, magnesium, iron and other trace minerals of the body through urinary excretion. Furthermore, caffeine decreases blood flow to the brain by as much as 30 percent, and it decreases the stimulation of insulin, a hormone that helps regulate the body's blood sugar level.&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt;

Stress can cause high levels of the following hormones: [[norepinephrine]], [[leptin]], [[NPY]], [[nitrite]], [[ACTH]] and [[adrenomedullin]].&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt; Elevated levels of adenosine, adrenaline, cortisol and [[dopamine]] in the blood can produce fatigue, depression, behavior changes, heart disease, weight problems, diabetes, and skin diseases. It also decreases the immune response, which can lead to heartburn and stomach ulcers.&lt;ref name=An/&gt;

The hormones of the [[menstrual cycle]] ([[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH)) during the examination periods are also affected.&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt; Female students may be disturbed during menstrual cycles because the FSH and LH normal levels changes radically. Medical students may also have disturbed sleep cycles in these periods.&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt;

==Psychological effects==
An optimal level of stress is considered good because medical students develop coping abilities.&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt;  However, too much stress causes problems. Previous studies have reported that a significant percentage of medical students suffer anxiety disorders because stress has a strong relationship to emotional and behavioral problems.&lt;ref name=ORourke/&gt; Feelings of disappointment academically are most prevalent in those students who have poor academic performance.&lt;ref name=Yusoff/&gt;

The major emotional disorders that have been observed include the inability to feel reasonably happy, loss of sleep, over-worry, constantly feeling under strain, feeling unhappy and [[Depression (mood)|depressed]], inability to concentrate, inability to enjoy normal activities, losing confidence in one’s self, inability to overcome difficulties, inability to face up to problems, inability to make decisions, inability to play a useful part in things, and believing oneself to be worthless.&lt;ref name=Firth&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Firth |first1=J |year=1986 |title= Levels and sources of stress in medical students |journal= British Medical Journal |volume= 292|issue=65 |pages=1177–1180 |pmc=1340185 |pmid=3085772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Given these emotional disorders, studies have also proved that medical students are more likely to have suicidal thoughts than students from other schools.

Female medical students may respond to the stress with stronger manifestations of anxiety. Physiological, psychological and behavioral stressors are found to be related to the metabolic changes of the body.&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt;

Stress may also harm professional effectiveness. It decreases attention, reduces concentration, impinges on decision-making skills, and reduces the ability to establish strong physician–patient relationships.&lt;ref name=Barikana&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barikana |first1=A |year=2007 |title= Stress in Medical Students |journal= Journal of Medical Education |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical students have also noticed changes in their behavior when they are stressed. Irritability and depression are common in students in later semesters, and these mental disturbances increase when examinations start.&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt;

==Treatment==
As too much stress causes problems, it is important to evaluate the degree of stress a student may have. Today,{{when|date=December 2015}} there are methods to assess the level of emotional stress that medical students can handle. It is advisable to manage study time and include healthy nutrition during the whole day. In addition, daily exercises can help to reduce the stress.&lt;ref name=ORourke/&gt; Interventions against [[academic dishonesty]] such as plagiarism also helps to prevent the risk of stress and depression in medical students. Studying in a small group also allows students to learn from each other and reduce the stress of learning by sharing ideas. Furthermore, some medical schools provide psychologists to help students manage stress.&lt;ref name=An/&gt;

Communication among third and fourth year medical students prepares them for the stressors of real-life clinical practice. This mental preparation stimulates the students to reduce the percentages of error in a medical consultation.&lt;ref name=VanDulmen/&gt; Medical students are prepared to diagnose and treat patients, but may not be adequately prepared to interact with the problems of their patient, or to deal with bad news as well as the patient's emotional stress during consultations.&lt;ref name=VanDulmen/&gt;

Emotional intelligence (EI) can be a protection against the effects of psychological stress, and it may enhance well-being. However, EI is molded through personality and has not been observed to be affected by stressful situations.&lt;ref name=ORourke/&gt; However, those students who participate in extracurricular activities have lower states of anxiety than those who are concentrated only on their studies.&lt;ref name=An/&gt;  To address these problems, some medical schools have made changes such as reducing the workweek, instituting curricular reforms such as having shorter classes, less rote memorization, and providing psychological services.&lt;ref name=Barikana/&gt;

Stress in medical students has become a focus of concern globally, with the first line of detection and defense of the stress being the students themselves. Some interventions include compulsory attendance in support groups, so the level of stigma is much lower than that associated with attending individual therapy. This provides long-term continuous support and help for students to monitor the progress and preparation for a better practice.&lt;ref name=ORourke/&gt;

Other stress-management programs provide trainees with coping techniques such as [[hypnosis]], imagery, and muscle relaxation; affiliation with peers, opportunities for emotional expression and intensified relationships with the faculty.&lt;ref name=Barikana/&gt;

The interventions of the majority of the programs use a group structure where the trainees meet with their peers, or with leaders.  No "gold standard" exists for the content of stress-reduction programs for medical trainees. Some propose a scheme of directed and non-directed support groups, relaxation training (including meditation and hypnosis), time-management and coping skills, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and mentoring programs.&lt;ref name=Barikana/&gt; Good intervention includes relaxation basics like abdominal breathing, learning to identify and counter negative thoughts, use of the imagery in relaxation, practical ways to increase healthy eating, building positive coping, applying relaxing or activating words appropriately, and redirecting time and energy to different tasks based on the level of importance.&lt;ref name=Brennan&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brennan |first1=J |year=2010 |title= Stress Management Intervention for First Year Medical Students |journal= Annals of Behavioral Science and Medical Education |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=15–19|doi=10.1007/BF03355126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the logistics of transporting students to and from school|a discussion of vehicles specifically designed for this purpose|school bus}}

'''Student transport''' is the transporting of [[children]] and [[teenagers]] to and from [[school]]s and school events. School transport can be undertaken by school students themselves (on foot, [[bicycle]] or perhaps [[horse]]back; or for older students, by [[car]]), they may be accompanied by family members or [[caregiver]]s, or the transport may be organised [[collective]]ly, using [[bus]]es or [[taxicab|taxis]].

==Transport modes==

===General public transport===
Using the general-purpose public transport is the most common means of student transport, in some countries. Sometimes the parents or the students get reimbursed when they buy public transport tickets.

===Bus===
{{Main|School bus by country}}
Student transport can use specially designed [[school bus]]es. Many districts in Canada and the United States use specially built and equipped school buses, painted [[school bus yellow]] and equipped with various forms of warning and safety devices specific to them. In other parts of the world, buses used for transporting students tend to be more general-purpose type buses than their North American counterparts.

===Car===
Parental transport of students in the family [[automobile]], sometimes termed the "[[school run]]", is increasing due to perceived hazards to unaccompanied children. Older students in some countries are able to drive themselves to school.

===Cycling and walking===
The [[Walk to school campaign]] and '[[walking bus]]es' promote the benefits of walking to school.

==Safety and student transport modes==
A 1994 report based on Australian road safety statistics&lt;ref&gt;D Hasler, University of New South Wales, quoted on [[RACV]] website, viewed 12 September 2013; available archived as '[https://archive.is/RQvR5 RACV - bus safety]' on the [[archive.is]] website, viewed 2013-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; found that traveling to school by bus is:
* 7 times less likely to cause serious injury or death than being driven in a family car,
* 31 times less likely to cause the same than walking
* 228 times less likely to cause the same than cycling.
Officials of the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (in the USA) say school buses are safer than cars, even if they are not fitted with seat belts.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Kristin Poland of NTSB, quoted at a hearing into a fatal 2012 bus crash at Chesterfield, Missouri, in "Buses safer than cars", ''Circular'', Bus and Coach Association of New Zealand, August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student transport by country==

===Argentina===
In [[Argentina]], although most students either walk, are driven by parents, or take regular public transit to school, many of them use private buses carrying an identification and authorization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/obr_publicas/transito/buscador_transporte_escolar.php?menu_id=23195 |title=Buenos Aires Ciudad&amp;nbsp;— Planeamiento y Obras Públicas |publisher=Buenosaires.gov.ar |date= |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of government in each city.  They are usually white and orange and are mostly vans,&lt;ref&gt;http://corrientes.in/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/transporte_escolar.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; a change from the times when bigger transit-style buses were used. Parents pay the van owner a monthly fee to carry their children back and forth from school. These vans are not affiliated to the school and usually transport children from different schools in the same route. {{Clarify|date=May 2010}}

===Australia===
In Australia, students who live in outer suburban or rural areas often travel on public buses and trains or on special routes provided by private bus companies. The school services cross-subsidise the regular bus routes. In inner city areas, school students travel on government-owned route service buses.  Students travel on either a public route bus, or a "school special" service.  Some private schools have their own buses which are often provided by a school where a private company is unwilling or unable to provide the service.

;New South Wales
In [[New South Wales]], school bus transport is listed as one of the safest forms of land transport, other than train (current figures are represented without seatbelts installed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/downloads/accidentstats2000.pdf|title=Road Traffic Accidents in NSW–2000 - Statistical Statement: Year Ended 31 December 2000|publisher=Roads and Traffic Authority|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in years K-2 get free travel regardless of where they live, students in years 3-6 get free travel if they live further than {{convert|1.6|km|mi}} radial distance or {{convert|2.3|km|mi}} by the most direct practical walking distance from the school, and high school students get free travel only if they live more than {{convert|2|km|mi}} radial distance or {{convert|2.9|km|mi}} by the most direct practical walking distance from school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/ssts/ssts.html School Student Transport Scheme: Eligibility Requirements].

===Canada===
In Canada, student transport is handled in much the same way as it is in the United States: the yellow school bus.  Canadian school districts usually engage [[school bus contractor]]s for student transport services, almost always provided without charge to families.  Outside of the [[metrification]] of the dashboard instruments and the French-language signage on school buses in the province of Quebec, Canadian and U.S. school buses are largely identical (and are produced by the same manufacturers).

===Finland===
In [[Finland]], students who live more than 5 kilometers away from the nearest school, or have other significant impediments to going to the school, are eligible to either bus or [[Taxicab|Taxi]] rides.&lt;ref&gt;Perusopetuslaki 32 §&lt;/ref&gt; The buses and taxis that are used are normal vehicles, typically operated by local companies. Buses that are reserved solely for school busing have "Koulukyyti/Skolskjuts" markings on front and back. Taxis  engaged in student transport have a triangular sign on the roof. Buses engaged in student transport are limited to driving at 80&amp;nbsp;km/h maximum speed.

===Germany===
There're no special school buses in Germany with a few exceptions. Public transport timetables are often adapted to the needs of secondary schools. Some German states offer a reimbursement for public transport tickets.

===Hong Kong===

{{Main article|Nanny van}}
In [[Hong Kong]], younger students are transported between their homes and schools by "[[nanny van]]s".  These vehicles are typically [[van]]-based and are smaller than a typical Hong Kong [[public light bus]].  When nanny vans originated, they were regulated primarily by the schools and the van drivers.  Today, in the interest of safety, nanny vans are government-regulated vehicles that run on fixed routes. Another Way Students Are transported are by School Buses which can fit 15 students a bus mother and a driver. The Bus Mother takes care of the children while they are on the bus and help the bus driver while he is driving. Some school buses fit up to 27 Students but are mostly 16 students per bus.

{{Clear}}

===The Netherlands===
In [[the Netherlands]], there isn't an organized form of student transport on a large scale.

Children who attend [[Education in the Netherlands#Elementary school|kindergarten]] are usually brought by their parents.

Almost all students at elementary school go to school by foot, as they live close by the school. Students who live further away, go by bike.

When the students go to high school, they usually go by bike. When the student has a handicap (or goes to a special education school) and is therefore not able to go to school by a regular bike, he or she gets a budget from the [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] to pay for a taxi to go to school with (with a normal taxi, there aren't different taxis for student who go to school) or for an annual season ticket so the students can use [[Transport in the Netherlands#Public transport|public transport]].

When the students go to college, they get an annual season ticket from the government, so they can use the public transport 'for free' ('For free', because when the government introduced this scheme in the 1990s, students yearly budgets were cut as a result, without a choice for students to opt in or out).

===New Zealand===
''See also [[School bus#New Zealand|School bus]].''

In New Zealand, student transport is sometimes provided by the [[New Zealand Ministry of Education]] through [[school bus contractor]]s or general [[bus company|bus companies]]. Bus companies generally have a fleet of older [[transit bus]]es or [[coach (vehicle)|coaches]], different from the newer public service fleet vehicles to cater for school services.  While carrying students are marked by either "SCHOOL", "SCHOOL BUS", "KURA" ([[Maori (language)|Maori]] for "school"), or [[pictogram]]s of children in black on a [[fluorescent]] [[chartreuse (color)|chartreuse]] background, and a limited on the open road to {{convert|80|km/h|abbr=on}} . These signs all indicate that a motorist should slow to {{convert|20|km/h|abbr=on}} when passing a stationary bus in either direction&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/roadcode/about-limits/speed-limits.html ''Speed limits''] on [[NZTA]] official New Zealand Road Code website, retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See this article on an instance of Maori bus sign usage in [[Rotorua]]: ''[http://www.rotoruadailypost.co.nz/local/news/principal-remains-adamant-over-kura-bus-signs/3689923/ Principal remains adamant over 'kura' bus signs]'' on [[Rotorua Daily Post]] website, retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A student is entitled to free school bus transport if they attend the closest state or state integrated school appropriate for the student's year level and gender, and in the case of a state integrated school, the special character the student or parents identifies with. However, students are not entitled to transport if they live within {{convert|3.2|km|abbr=on}} of the school for primary school students (ages 5–12) or within {{convert|4.8|km|abbr=on}} of the school for secondary school students (ages 13–18). Students are also not eligible if there are suitable public transport services between the school and the student's residence, ruling out free transport in most cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minedu.govt.nz/NZEducation/EducationPolicies/Schools/SchoolOperations/SchoolTransport/SchoolTransportHomePage/TransportEntitlementZones.aspx Transport Entitlement Zones] on [[New Zealand Ministry of Education]] website, retrieved 13 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Free school busing is a fast-diminishing phenomenon in New Zealand.  It has historically favored rural students.  As population migration trends internal to New Zealand have favored the growth of cities, it is an increasingly smaller minority of students who are served by school buses.  Parents, acting as chauffeurs, are filling this gap, with multiple negative consequences (e.g., productivity losses for the New Zealand workforce, increased vehicular traffic interfering with commercial or industrial traffic well into the work-day, increased carbon footprint, diminished development of transport self-management skills in early teenagers, dangerous concentrations of hectic motoring near congested school entrances at school start-times, etc.).  The matter occasionally surfaces in the New Zealand media, but making free school busing the norm is usually dismissed as another example of American-style thinking.

In [[Auckland]], New Zealand, as at November 2007, one hundred schools were running 230 [[walking bus]]es with over 4,000 children and 1,500 adults participating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelwise.org.nz/media/pdf/2007_STPeval.pdf Auckland Regional Transport Authority School Travel Evaluation for the 2007 school year]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before school buses were introduced, from 1924 onwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = News Items|url = http://www.piopio.net.nz/news-item/first-school-bus-in-new-zealand-to-be-restored|website = Piopio|accessdate = 8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; rural children rode to school and left their horses in the school paddock,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 3.  – Horses – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/horses/page-3|website = www.teara.govt.nz|accessdate = 8 January 2016|first = New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last = Taonga}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as a [[glebe]] in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wairarapaschoolhistory.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/School-Gazetteer-PDF.pdf|title = Wairarapa School History|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Education Department paid about 4d a day towards the upkeep of each horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Te Mata - Te Hutewai the Early Days|last = VERNON|first = R. T.|publisher = A. O. RICE LIMITED|year = 1972|isbn = |location = |pages = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first buses allowed five rural schools to be merged into one, a pattern which continued as school buses spread (e.g. [[Closed schools in the Northland Region|Raupo Consolidated High School]] in 1929&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll?BU=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.aucklandcity.govt.nz%252Fdbtw-wpd%252FHeritageImages%252Findex.htm&amp;AC=QBE_QUERY&amp;TN=heritageimages&amp;QF0=ID&amp;NP=2&amp;MR=5&amp;RF=HIORecordSearch&amp;QI0=%253D%2522AWNS-19290228-41-1%2522|title=Inmagic DB/ Auckland Weekly New photo - TO SCHOOL BY MOTOR-BUS : THE CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLE IN OPERATION|website=www.aucklandcity.govt.nz|access-date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), so that, by 1940, the five had increased to 650,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/docs/2006/NZJH_40_1_06.pdf|title=BOARDING THE SCHOOL BUS - with photos and details of the 1924 buses|last=MOSS|first=LOGAN|date=2006|website=|publisher=New Zealand Journal of History|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but wartime rationing slowed the pace of consolidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19400812.2.58|title=COUNTRY CHILDREN (New Zealand Herald, 1940-08-12)|last=|first=|date=|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz National Library of New Zealand|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, most student transport is performed by ordinary [[transit bus]]es. These buses can be used for other purposes when not in use for school journeys. Most children use local scheduled [[public transport]] bus services.  In almost all cases, dedicated school transport bus services in the UK are contracted out to local bus companies.

;London
In [[Greater London]], many school children travel to school using the ordinary bus service as the bus stops are very close together and travel is free using the [[Oyster card]] system.

In the United Kingdom, there are concerns about children's safety after they have alighted from [[transit bus|conventional buses]] used for student transport.&lt;ref name="School bus bill goes to PM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/8089414.stm|title=School bus safety bill goes to PM |publisher=BBC News|date=8 June 2009|accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Commons debate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/8130033.stm|title=Commons debates school bus safety|publisher=BBC News|date=2 July 2009|accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also more general worries about safety, such as lack of seatbelts, crowded buses, and in [[Northern Ireland]] especially, the use of "three for two" seating, where three children are expected to sit on a bench seat intended for two passengers.&lt;ref name="NI School bus safety"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/5314882.stm|title=School bus safety to be improved|publisher=BBC News|date=5 September 2006|accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other concerns include poorly maintained buses, drivers' backgrounds, children travelling on public buses and school children's behaviour. In one case in 2009, two boys aged 14 and 15 fell out of a bus window, after they leaned on the side of the [[Premiere Travel]] bus they were travelling on.&lt;ref name="School kids fall out of bus"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/8118288.stm|title=Two fall out of school bus window|publisher=BBC News|date=25 June 2009|accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this, over the past decade, starting in around 2000,&lt;ref name="First talk of yellow buses"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/784567.stm|title=UK may get yellow school buses|publisher=BBC News|date=13 June 2000|accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the talk of and introduction of dedicated, [[school bus yellow|yellow]] student-specific [[school bus]]es has been widespread. In 2005, it was reported that the introduction of such buses would "save pupils". As well as safety benefits,&lt;ref name="A US icon"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4098782.stm|title=Yellow school buses&amp;nbsp;— a US icon|publisher=BBC News|date=16 June 2005|accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it would also be better to the environment.&lt;ref name="Yellow bus would save pupils"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4095276.stm|title=Yellow buses 'would save pupils'|publisher=BBC News|date=15 June 2005|accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North American-style '[[school bus yellow|yellow]]' [[school bus]]es (built by European manufacturers) are being introduced by [[First Student UK]] and [[My bus]].

====Walking====
The [[Walk to school campaign]] is a British campaign promoting the benefits of walking to school. It is run by the charities [[Living Streets (UK)|Living Streets]] and [[Travelwise]]. It receives funding from the [[Department for Transport]] and [[Transport for London]].

[[Walking bus]]es have remained popular. The first walking bus in the United Kingdom was introduced in 1998 by [[Hertfordshire]] County Council and used by students of [[Wheatfields Junior School]] in [[St Albans]] in 1998 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/880055.stm|title=Walking bus up for award|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===
[[File:2008 blue bird vision tinted.jpg|thumb|alt=A late 2000s Blue Bird Vision|A typical [[school bus]] in United States: specifically designed for students and painted [[school bus yellow|yellow]].]]
In the United States, purpose-built [[school bus]]es are the primary means of student transport, almost always provided without charge to families. In the US, the term, "busing" is also used to refer to '''[[Desegregation busing in the United States|desegregation busing]]''', the transport of students to schools other than the closest local school for increased [[racial integration]].

Each year, school buses provide an estimated 10 billion student trips in the United States. Every school day, 475,000 school buses transport 25 million children to and from schools and school-related activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=School Bus Facts | publisher=National Association for Pupil Transportation| date=10 July 2009|url=http://www.napt.org/associations/3103/files/SBIC2007FactSheet.cfm | accessdate=6 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  School buses are purchased or leased by some [[school district]]s, while other school districts engage the service of [[school bus contractor]]s to perform this function.  Approximately 40% of school districts in the United States use contractors to handle the function of student transport.

However, the use of standard [[public transit]] buses is increasingly common in urban areas. For example, New York City provides yellow [[school bus]] service to select students based on grade level and their distance from the school, but relies on the public [[New York City Transit buses|New York City Transit bus system]] to transport students in grades 7-12 and younger students where dedicated school bus service is unavailable. Free or half-price transit passes are provided by the school system for this purpose.&lt;ref name="nyc-doe"&gt;{{cite web|last=New York City Department of Education|title=General Education Eligibility|url=http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/Transportation/ParentResources/GeneralEducationEligibility/default.htm|work=Pupil Transportation|accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some public transit services may provide "tripper service" with routes designed to serve local schools. Such routes are regularly scheduled transit routes that are open to the public and, by law, cannot be used exclusively for school transportation, but are drawn to connect local schools to nearby communities and transit centers.
Most kids over the age of 16 drive to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Federal Transit Administration|title=School Bus|url=http://www.fta.dot.gov/documents/17_SchoolBus_TriennialGuidance_2010_WKBK.pdf|work=FY 2010 Triennial Review Workshop Workbook|accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Tower SP''''' is a 2005 [[Construction and management simulation games|construction and management simulation]] video game for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. It is a port and revision of the ''[[SimTower]]'' (1994), a.k.a. ''The Tower'' in [[Japan]], with some elements of ''[[Yoot Tower]]'' (1998). In the game, the player is tasked to construct a tower for their company boss, Yama.

==Differences with ''SimTower''==

In ''The Tower SP'', perhaps due to the limitations of the [[Game Boy Advance]]'s system, the "Tower" status (the highest available tower rating) is obtained with a population of 2,000 people; a goal which is quite hard considering the height limit for the building is 50 floors(35 floors for the commercial tower) and a certain foundation width. The width is slowly expanded as Yama gets deregulation for the roads and buildings surrounding the player's Tower. However, reaching that population is not enough. The "Tower" status is only awarded when a wedding takes place in the building, which only occurs when a cathedral is constructed at the maximum height, the cathedral can be reached without any stress, the cathedral is full, and when there are 2,000 people in the building at that moment.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Tower SP.PNG|right|thumb|Two ''The Tower SP'' screenshots, depicting hotel suites ('''top''') and heightened ground level lobby ('''bottom''').|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 11 April 2009}}]] --&gt;

Achieving a "Tower" status with the Office Building unlocks the possibility of building a "Commercial Building". The site permits construction of a higher lobby at the ground floor, but doesn't permit the construction of building offices, condominiums, medical centers, security offices, nor recycling centers, allows up to 3 cinemas in the building (whereas the Office Building only allowed one), as well as a spa with water from a [[hot spring]] and hotel suites (once the appropriate star rating is reached). As such, building built in this mode may resemble a mall-hotel hybrid, depending on the player's design.

Other features are taken from ''[[Yoot Tower]]'', while some are new. Restrooms must be built; security must check the player's tower nightly; housekeeping cleans offices weekly, and cockroach infestation now has three phases: one (which requires a bug bomb), two (which requires a costly exterminator), and three (which condemns the infested facility). Like ''Yoot Tower'', the player must use different shops and stores to satisfy tenants and visitors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5889">The '''Thinking Skills Assessment''' (also known as '''TSA''') is a generic admissions [[Test (assessment)|test]], which is used as part of the admissions process for entry to some undergraduate courses at the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University College London]]. 

==History==
TSA was developed and is run by [[Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing]]. It was developed to help universities assess whether applicants have the skills and aptitudes considered essential for Higher Education study. Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing produces and distributes practice materials, including specimen questions and past papers, on their website.

The test was first introduced for undergraduate entry to the [[University of Cambridge]] in 2001 and was used as part of the admissions process for a number of undergraduate courses. It is currently used for application to the Land Economy course only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/land-economy|title=Land Economy|date=17 July 2017|website=Undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[University of Oxford]] introduced TSA as part of its admissions process for [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE). At this stage, the test was known as the ‘PPE Admissions Test’. The use of TSA was extended for entry to Economics and Management in 2008; to Experimental Psychology, and Psychology and Philosophy in 2009, Geography, Philosophy and Linguistics, and Psychology and Linguistics in 2012, and in 2015 to Human Sciences. Since 2016, candidates applying for Chemistry have been required to sit a version of TSA consisting of Section 1 of the test only (TSA S1), with History and Economics requiring the same from 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissionstesting.org/images/302047-courses-requiring-tsa-oxford.pdf|format=PDF|title=Courses requiring TSA Oxford : Candidates intending to apply for entry to one of the following courses at the University of Oxford are required to take TSA|website=Admissionstesting.org|accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2018, the University of Oxford no longer required applicants to take TSA for entry to their Geography course.

Since the 2008–09 application cycle, [[University College London]] has used TSA to assist in the selection of applicants to European Social and Political Studies (ESPS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissionstesting.org/images/84739-courses-requiring-tsa-ucl-2015.pdf|format=PDF|title=Courses requiring TSA UCL : Candidates intending to apply for entry to one of the following courses at University College London (UCL) are required to take TSA|website=Admissionstesting.org|accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
TSA consists of one or two sections, depending on the university and course being applied for. Section 2 is used in addition to Section 1 by the University of Oxford for certain courses. 

* Section 1 (90 minutes): 50 multiple-choice questions testing problem solving (including numerical and spatial reasoning) and critical thinking skills (including understanding argument and reasoning using everyday language). 

* Section 2 (30 minutes): Candidates must answer one essay question from a choice of four (questions are not subject specific). It tests the ability to organise ideas in a clear and concise manner, and communicate them effectively in writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissionstesting.org/for-institutions/about-our-tests/thinking-skills-assessment/|title=Thinking Skills Assessment (TSA) - Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing|website=Admissionstesting.org|accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring==
The multiple-choice answers (Section 1) are marked by [[Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing]] with 1 mark available per question. Final scores are calculated to one decimal place on the TSA scale (running approximately 0–100) using the [[Rasch model|Rasch]] statistical technique. 
 
The writing task component of TSA (Section 2) used by the University of Oxford is reviewed by admissions tutors.&lt;ref name="admissionstestingservice.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissionstestingservice.org/for-test-takers/thinking-skills-assessment/tsa-oxford/scoring-and-results/|title=Scoring and results - TSA Oxford - Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing|website=Admissionstesting.org|accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timing and results==
===University College London===
For University College London (UCL), TSA is taken during the interview stage. It is administered as a paper-based test. UCL admissions interviews are held on specific dates from December to March. Results are reported to the university only.

===The University of Cambridge and The University of Oxford===
For the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford, TSA is held in late October/early November as a pre-interview, paper-based test taken at schools, colleges or authorised test centres globally. Results are issued in mid-January of the following year, via Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing’s [https://results.cambridgeassessment.org.uk/candidates/controller/open/login.html results online portal].

==Usage==
The exact use of results varies between the subjects which use the test, and candidates need to refer to their chosen course for precise details.&lt;ref name="admissionstestingservice.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6221">[[File:VirtualTeachingCollection1.jpg|thumb|Image of Cabinet Interface (1995).]]
The '''Virtual Teaching Collection''' ('''VTC''') project at the [[University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] within the [[University of Cambridge]], led by Dr [[Robin Boast]], ran from 1994 to 1997 and was part of the [[Teaching and Learning Technology Project]] funded by the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| last=Boast | first=Robin | authorlink=Robin Boast | year=1995 | title=The Virtual Teaching Collection: Multimedia access to museum collections | work=Proceedings of Information: the Hidden Resource, The Seventh International Conference of the Museum Documentation Association, Edinburgh | location=Cambridge | publisher=[[Museum Documentation Association]] | pages=323–334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VTC was an early innovative social computing project that developed a software program, Cabinet, which ran on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Macs and allowed users to create, develop, manage and comment on [[virtual museum]] collections. The project anticipated many of the current features of the [[social web]] and [[social computing]].

The VTC was concerned with virtual objects. It was a collection of digital representations that may be used as a collection. The images did not pretend to be the objects, but were objects in their own right and, therefore, able to constitute a collection in their own right.

The goals of the VTC were twofold.{{fact|date=December 2013}} First, to explore the range and potential of producing and using digital representations in their various forms; images, texts, hypertexts, video, sound, 3-D images and illustrations. Second, to construct a working digital museum that was meaningful to the way we work with collections.

The collections that were developed included about 4,000 images and other representations of objects, along with the related catalogue information.{{fact|date=December 2013}} Within the [[Archaeology]] Collection, these objects span the [[Neolithic]] to the [[Medieval]] period in Britain. The [[History of Science]] Collection drew on the collections of the [[Whipple Museum]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[Museum of the History of Science|History of Science]] Collection at the [[University of Oxford]]. As well as directly related information, these Collections also included text, video, and display resources, as well as bibliographies and glossaries.

Included in the collections were a variety of what were called "[[narratives]]". These were works using the collections in a variety of forms from traditional documents to hyper-documents to display spaces, but these are seen, much as any work, as the view of an author. This was central to the way that Cabinet collections work. They are not fixed ‘textbooks’ but flexible resources that teachers and students may work with to create meaningful works. It was in this way that the collections do not form an end in themselves, but a means of working. They are the very flexible resource that students and researchers use to think with.

==Cabinet==
''[[Cabinet (software)|Cabinet]]'' was a software application developed as part of the VTC and was designed to be an easy to use and well presented suite of software tools that were intuitive.{{fact|date=December 2013}} Using these tools, the user could create their own collection, and could search, retrieve, display and browse the existing collections. The presentation tools allowed the user to compare different objects, to identify and display significant details, to create links to related images, video and text, and to embed representations in their own authored texts or other presentations, whether these be straightforward documents or more complex hyper-documents.

Cabinet was not simply a multimedia authoring tool.{{fact|date=December 2013}} It was designed to be under the control not only of the author, but also of the reader. The collections were not interactive in the conventional sense, but were interactive in the sense that the reader could also modify or even re-author what had been produced. This kind of flexibility of presentation tools freed the user from the rigidity of traditional presentations and gave access to the full potential of contextualising information. There was an increased variety of narrative forms, but, primarily, it was an environment within which students and researchers could construct and explore new ways of thinking about material objects and their history.

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2018}}

In 1876 the ''Rijkslandbouwschool'' (National Agricultural College) was established in Wageningen. Due to the development of the training to a higher educational level it changed in 1896 to the ''Hoogere Land- en Boschbouwschool'' (Agricultural and Forestry College) and in 1904 in ''Rijks Hoogere Land-, Tuin- en Boschbouwschool'' (National Agricultural, Horticulture and Forestry College).

In 1918 the school became academic by law (Academic Education Act). The name changed to ''Rijks Landbouw Hoogeschool'' (National Agricultural College). The openings date and official [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|Dies natalis]] is 9 March 1918.

In 1986 the "hogescholen" (comparable to scientific [[institute of technology]]) were renamed to University in a modification of the Academic Education Act. The new name became ''Landbouwuniversiteit Wageningen (LUW)'' (Wageningen Agricultural University (WAU)). The 1986 law changes resulted in the use of the name [[Hogeschool#Netherlands|hogeschool]] in the Dutch system to be used exclusively for universities of applied science.

Over the years the research and teaching branched out into life sciences in general; while interest for agriculture as a career opportunity waned. In 1997, when the DLO institutes merged with the university, the new holding was rebranded as Wageningen UR (Wageningen University and Research Centre); with the University being renamed Wageningen University. Under the Dutch laws the University and the institutes had to remain separate legal entities.

In 2006, the university of applied sciences [[Van Hall Larenstein]] became part of Wageningen UR. The idea was to create better collaboration between applied teaching and research at Van Hall and the academic research at Wageningen University. This would also support students to continue with an academic program upon completing their applied degree. However, due to differences in organizational culture and incompatibility of procedures for the different types of higher education, collaboration between the two schools remained problematic. In 2012 it was decided that Van Hall Larenstein would leave Wageningen UR and continue as an independent school once more. In the spring of 2015 the separation was marked by the move of the final Wageningen-based Van Hall Larenstein studies back to [[Velp, Gelderland|Velp]].

In 2009 it was decided that the University would consistently use the English name in its communication. In addition university research could be presented under the name of the university: ''Wageningen University (WU)'' (as an alternative of using the name of the holding Wageningen UR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wageningen Universiteit (WU)|url=http://www.studie.nl/school/W/Wageningen_Universiteit_%28WU%29|publisher=Studie.nl|accessdate=6 March 2013|language=Dutch|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107041532/http://www.studie.nl/school/W/Wageningen_Universiteit_(WU)|archive-date=2012-11-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Wageningen UR|url=http://www.wageningenur.nl/en/About-Wageningen-UR/History-of-Wageningen-UR.htm|publisher=Wageningenur.nl|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September 2016 Wageningen University and the research institutes decided to continue as one, jointly brand: ''Wageningen University &amp; Research'' (''WUR''). On 9 March 2018 Wageningen University &amp; Research celebrates her 100 years anniversary. During this year there are many events and festivities around the campus and in the city of Wageningen. 

==Academic profile==
Wageningen University &amp; Research was the first Dutch university or school that was allowed to use the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System]] (ECTS) label. This label is awarded by the [[European Commission]] and guarantees the quality of the study programme. An important consideration is that the university consequently applies the European Credit Transfer System; this promotes the mobility of students within Europe and prevents study delay. The label is an acknowledgement of the international character of the university. Out of 56 European applications in 2005, only three ECTS labels were awarded.

===BSc programmes===

'''World Water Monitoring Day''' was established in 2003 by America's Clean Water Foundation (ACWF) as a global [[Environmental education|educational outreach]] program. The program, subsequently named the "World Water Monitoring Challenge" and "'''EarthEcho Water Challenge'''," aims to build public awareness and involvement in protecting [[water resource]]s around the world by empowering citizens to carry out [[Water quality#Sampling and measurement|basic monitoring]] of their local water bodies.&lt;ref name="monitoring challenge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatermonitoringday.org |title=EarthEcho Water Challenge |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |publisher=EarthEcho International |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberta (Robbi) Savage, ACWF's President and CEO created WWMD, and Edward Moyer was the first WWMD Coordinator. 

A simple test kit enables everyone, children and adults, to sample local water bodies for a set of [[water quality]] parameters including temperature, acidity (pH), clarity ([[turbidity]]) and [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]] (DO). Information on purchasing low-cost test kits is available from the current sponsoring organization, [[EarthEcho International]], and the results of monitoring events are then shared with participating communities around the globe on the sponsor's website.&lt;ref name="monitoring challenge"/&gt;

World Water Monitoring Day was originally celebrated annually on September 18. This date was initially chosen to be a month later (October 18) to recognize the anniversary of the US [[Clean Water Act]], which was enacted by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1972 to restore and protect the country’s water resources. In 2007, the date was changed to facilitate participation in parts of the world where temperatures reach freezing conditions at that time.

In 2006, ACWF transferred the coordination of the event to the [[Water Environment Federation]] (WEF) and the [[International Water Association]] (IWA). The collective goal was to expand participation to one million people in 100 countries by 2012. In January 2015 the management of World Water Monitoring Day was transferred to EarthEcho International.

2008 saw students from [[Indonesia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/11/25/students-take-part-water-monitoring.html?t=1227619851#comment-9070 Students take part in water monitoring], The Jakarta Post, November, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Arkansas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecabin.net/stories/112508/sty_1125080028.shtml Environmental concerns make water protection necessary], The Cabin.net, November, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; taking part in water sampling to bring attention to the importance of water quality.

As of 2018, EarthEcho International encourages participants to conduct their monitoring activities as part of the "EarthEcho Water Challenge" during any period between March 22 ([[World Water Day]]) and December of each year.&lt;ref name="monitoring challenge"/&gt;
