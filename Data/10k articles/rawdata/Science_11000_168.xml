'''3C 279''' (also known as '''4C–05.55''', '''NRAO 413''', and '''PKS 1253–05''') is an [[OVV quasar|optically violent variable quasar]] (OVV), which is known in the astronomical community for its variations in the [[Visible spectrum|visible]], [[Radio frequency|radio]], and [[x-ray]] bands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aanda.org/index.php?option=article&amp;access=standard&amp;Itemid=129&amp;url=/articles/aa/full/2005/24/aa1815-04/aa1815-04.html Resonant absorption troughs in the gamma-ray spectra  of  QSO] See section 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; The quasar was observed to have undergone a period of extreme activity from 1987 until 1991.&lt;ref name="webbetal1990"&gt;{{cite journal|display-authors=6|author=J.

Apparent [[Superluminal#Astronomical observations|superluminal motion]] was detected during observations first made in 1973 in a jet of material departing from the quasar, though it should be understood that this effect is an optical illusion caused by naive estimations of the speed, and no truly superluminal motion is occurring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacetimetravel.org/bewegung/bewegung4.html Apparent superluminal motion]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lake Baikal Research Expedition ===
During summer of 2016, Harrison was accepted by [[Wellesley College]] to take part in a scientific research expedition to [[Siberia]]'s [[Lake Baikal]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Harrison was part of a 12 student cohort working with Wellesley Professor [[Marianne V. Moore|Marianne Moore]], in collaboration with a team of 15 scientists from the United States and Russia, in a long term study exploring the effect of climate change on Lake Baikal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.astronautabby.com/wellesley-college-lake-baikal-research-expedition/|title=Lake Baikal Scientific Research Expedition Wellesley 2016|date=2016-03-06|publisher=Astronaut Abby|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sweetyhigh.com/read/astronaut-abby-mars-generation-interview-110816|title=THIS Is When Astronaut Abby Will Be the First Person to Step Foot on Mars|publisher=Sweety High|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the research project, Harrison used grazer exclusion pens to study the effect the vast grazer populations in Lake Baikal have on the growth of algae.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wellesleybaikal2016.blogspot.com/|title=Wellesley-Байкал 2016|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 2016, Harrison and her research partners, presented a paper on the topic of "Stream Delivery of Nutrients into Lake Systems and Resulting in Eutrophication" at the [[Wellesley College]] Tanner Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wellesley.edu/tanner/archives|title=The Tanner Conference|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Wellesley College|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schuerger Lab ===
In June 2017, Harrison began working as an intern in the Mars Lab of Dr. Andrew Schuerger of the [[University of Florida]] located in the Space Life Sciences Labs at [[Kennedy Space Center]] in [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2017/03/17/meet-abby-harrison-the-college-sophomore-headed-for-mars/|title=Meet Abby Harrison, the college sophomore headed for Mars|date=2017-03-17|publisher=USA Today|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://code.likeagirl.io/on-her-way-to-mars-4c87705b1031|title=On Her way to Mars – Code Like A Girl|date=2017-01-17|publisher=Code Like A Girl|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research focuses on the search for [[life on Mars]], through characterizing the limits of growth by terrestrial microorganisms under Martian conditions. Dr. Schruerger and his team have successfully grown 31 bacteria (but no [[Fungus|fungi]] or [[archaea]]) under Martian conditions. Harrison's work will help contribute to several ongoing projects pertaining to the growth of S. liquefaciens under simulated Martian conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.astronautabby.com/exciting-news-summer-astrobiology-research-internship-kennedy-space-center/|title=Astronaut Abby's Summer Astrobiology Research Internship at Kennedy Space Center|date=2017-04-18|publisher=Astronaut Abby|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public Engagement ==
{{overly detailed |section|date=August 2018}}
In 2011, at the age of 13, Harrison began to speak publicly about her dream of being the first astronaut to walk on Mars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15331">In [[business administration]], '''absorptive capacity''' has been defined as "a firm's ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends".  It is studied on individual, group, firm, and national levels. Antecedents are prior-based knowledge (knowledge stocks and knowledge flows) and communication. Studies involve a firm's innovation performance, aspiration level, and organizational learning. It has been said that in order to be innovative an organization should develop its absorptive capacity.&lt;ref name=colev/&gt;

==Cohen and Levinthal's model==
The concept of absorptive capacity was first defined as a firm's "ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends" by Cohen and Levinthal.&lt;ref name=colev&gt;Cohen and Levinthal (1990), "Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation", ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', Volume 35, Issue 1 pg. 128-152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen and Levinthal (1989), "Innovation and learning: The two faces of R&amp;D", ''The Economic Journal'', Volume 99, September pg. 569-596.&lt;/ref&gt; For them, absorptive capacity depends greatly on prior related knowledge and diversity of background. Therefore, they’ve put the investments a firm makes in its research and development efforts ("R&amp;D") central to their model of development of absorptive capacity.  The absorptive capacity is seen as cumulative, meaning that it is easier for a firm to invest on a constant basis in its absorptive capacity than investing punctually. Efforts put to develop absorptive capacity in one period will make it easier to accumulate it in the next one.

“The cumulativeness of absorptive capacity and its effect on expectation formation suggest an extreme case of path dependence in which once a firm ceases investing in its absorptive capacity in a quickly moving field, it may never assimilate and exploit new information in that field, regardless of the value of that information.”

Absorptive capacity is also said to be a reason for companies to invest in [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] instead of simply purchasing the results ''post factum'' (e.g. [[patent]]s). Internal R&amp;D teams increase the absorptive capacity of a company. A firm’s investment in R&amp;D then impacts directly its absorptive capacity. The more a firm invests in research and development activities, the more it will be able to fully appreciate the value of new external information.

Cohen and Levinthal also stressed that diversity allows individual to make “novel associations and linkages”. They therefore encourage the hiring of diverse teams in order to have a variety of individuals working together and exposing themselves to other ways of looking at things.

== Zahra and George's model ==

Cohen and Levinthal have focused a lot on investments in R&amp;D to develop one’s absorptive capacity, but many other researchers showed later on that several other areas could be explored to develop an organization’s absorptive capacity. This led to a review of the concept by [[Shaker Zahra]] and [[Gerry George]]&lt;ref&gt;Zahra and George (2002), "Absorptive Capacity: A Review,Reconceptualization,and Extension", ''Academy of Management Review'',Volume 27, Issue 2,pg.185-203&lt;/ref&gt; and a reformulation of the definition that expanded greatly the concept and further defined it as being made of two different absorptive capacities: potential absorptive capacity and realized absorptive capacity. Their new definition of absorptive capacity is: “a set of organizational routines and processes by which firms acquire, assimilate, transform and exploit knowledge to produce a dynamic organizational capability.”

===Potential Absorptive Capacity===
Zahra and George presented the potential absorptive capacity is made of two elements.  First there is knowledge acquisition which “refers to a firm’s capability to identify and acquire externally generated knowledge that is critical to its operations.” Second, there is assimilation capability which “refers to the firm’s routines and processes that allow it to analyze, process, interpret and understand the information obtained from external sources.”  “Potential absorptive capacity makes the firm receptive to acquiring and assimilating external knowledge.”

===Realized Absorptive Capacity===
Realized absorptive capacity is made up of transformation capability on one hand that can be defined as “a firm’s capability to develop and refine the routines that facilitate combining existing knowledge and the newly acquired and assimilated knowledge.”  On the other hand, realized absorptive capacity is also made of the exploitation capability of a firm which is basically the capacity of a firm to apply the newly acquired knowledge in product or services that it can get financial benefit from. “Realized absorptive capacity is a function of the transformation and exploitation capabilities.”

Zahra and George go on to suggest a series of indicators that can be used to evaluate each element of absorptive capacity.
* Knowledge acquisition capability (the number of years of experience of the R&amp;D department, the amount of R&amp;D investment)
* Assimilation capability (the number of cross-firm patent citations, the number of citations made in a firm’s publications to research developed in other firms)
* Transformation capability (the number of new product ideas, the number of new research projects initiated)
* Exploitation capability (the number of patent, the number of new product announcements, the length of product development cycle)

George and his colleagues (Zou, Ertug, George, 2018)&lt;ref&gt;Zou, T., Ertug, G., &amp; George, G. (2018). The capacity to innovate: a meta-analysis of absorptive capacity. Innovation, 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt; conduct a meta-analysis of absorptive capacity and they find that: (1)Absorptive capacity is a strong predictor of innovation and knowledge transfer, and its effects on financial performance are fully mediated by innovation and knowledge transfer; (2) The firm size-absorptive capacity relationship is positive for small firms but negative for larger firms. The firm age-absorptive capacity relationship is negative for mature firms and not significant for young firms; (3) Social integration mechanisms, knowledge infrastructure, management support, and relational capability all have a positive and significant impact on the absorptive capacity-innovation relationship (whereas they do not find the breadth of external search or competitive intensity to impact that relationship). Environmental dynamism has a marginally significant negative impact on the absorptive capacity-innovation relationship; and (4) They also find that the absorptive capacity-innovation relationship is stronger when absorptive capacity is measured by surveys rather than when absorptive capacity is measured by archival proxies.

===A refined model of Absorptive Capacity===

A more recent contribution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Todorova|first=Gergana|last2=Durisin|first2=Boris|date=2007|title=Absorptive Capacity: Valuing a Reconceptualization|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20159334|journal=The Academy of Management Review|volume=32|issue=3|pages=774–786|doi=10.2307/20159334}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed to (a) reintroduce the original first component in Cohen and Levinthal's model. The contribution noted (b) that transformation is not a step after assimilation, but represents an alternative process. Consequently, it suggested that (c) the neat distinction between potential absorptive capacity and realized absorptive capacity does not hold any more.

ad (a): Firms often fail to identify and absorb new external knowledge; recognizing the value of new external knowledge is often biased and needs to be fostered; it is not automatic. Managers have often problems in assessing the value of new external knowledge when it is not relevant for the current demands of key customers.

ad (b): Both assimilation and transformation involve some degree of change of the new knowledge and its combination with the existing knowledge. When the new knowledge fits existing cognitive schemas well, it is assimilated. When the new knowledge cannot be assimilated, the cognitive structures must be transformed. Firms transform their knowledge structures when knowledge cannot be assimilated. Transformation does not follow assimilation, it is an alternative to it.

ad (c): As transformation is an alternative to assimilation and not sequential to assimilation, it becomes part of potential absorptive capacity in Zahra and George's model; consequently, realized absorptive capacity simply relabels the component of exploitation. Further, without the effect of realized capacity, potential capacity cannot have any effect on a firm's competitive advantage; potential absorptive capacity cannot be meaningful separated from realized absorptive capacity in empirical studies on value creation. 

Accordingly, firms with high levels of absorptive capacity (1) recognize the value of new external knowledge, (2) acquire, (3) assimilate ''or'' transform, and (4) exploit new external knowledge.

Today the theory involves [[organizational learning]], industrial economics, the [[resource-based view]] of the firm and [[dynamic capabilities]]. This theory has undergone major refinement, and today a firm's absorptive capacity is mostly conceptualized as a [[dynamic capabilities|dynamic capability]].

Two concepts related to absorptive capacity are:

* Receptivity: The firm's overall ability to be aware of, identify  and take effective advantage of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Seaton R.A.F. &amp; Cordey-Hayes M., The Development and Application of Interactive Models of Industrial Technology Transfer, Technovation, 13: 45-53, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Innovative Routines]]: Practiced routines that define a set of competencies the firm is capable of doing confidently and the focus of the firm's innovation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson &amp; Winter (1982), "The Schumpeterian Tradeoff Revisited", ''The American Economic Review'', Volume 72, Issue 1,pg.114-132&lt;/ref&gt;

In regions in the [[Global South]], [[regional innovation agencies]] can work as knowledge gatekeepers to stimulate new technological trajectories by facilitating the acquisition, diffusion and engaging in the ‘tropicalization’ of extra-regional knowledge to facilitate its absorption within the [[regional innovation system]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23792949.2018.1538702?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10371">In [[algorithmic information theory]], '''algorithmic probability''', also known as '''Solomonoff probability''', is a mathematical method of assigning a prior [[probability]] to a given observation. It was invented by [[Ray Solomonoff]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Solomonoff, R., "[http://world.std.com/~rjs/z138.pdf A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference]", Report V-131, Zator Co., Cambridge, Ma. (Nov. 1960 revision of the Feb. 4, 1960 report).&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is used in inductive inference theory and analyses of algorithms. In  his [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference | general theory of inductive inference]], Solomonoff uses the [[Solomonoff's prior|prior]]{{Clarify|date=September 2017}} obtained by this formula{{Which|date=September 2017}}, in [[Bayes' rule]] for prediction {{Examples|date=September 2017}}{{Explain|date=September 2017}}.&lt;ref&gt;Li, M. and Vitanyi, P., ''An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications'', 3rd Edition, Springer Science and Business Media, N.Y., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mathematical formalism used, the observations have the form of finite binary strings, and the universal prior is a probability distribution over the set of finite binary strings {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.  The prior is universal in the
Turing-computability sense, i.e. no string has zero probability. It is not computable, but it can be approximated.&lt;ref&gt;Hutter, M., Legg, S., and Vitanyi, P., [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Algorithmic_probability "Algorithmic Probability"], Scholarpedia, 2(8):2572, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
	

==Overview==

Algorithmic probability deals with the following questions:{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Given a body of data about some phenomenon that we want to understand, how can we select the most probable [[hypothesis]] of how it was caused from among all possible hypotheses and how can we evaluate the different hypotheses? How can we predict future data and how can we measure the likelihood of that prediction being the right one?

Four principal inspirations for Solomonoff's algorithmic probability were: [[Occam's razor]], [[Epicurus#Epistemology|Epicurus' principle of multiple explanations]], modern computing theory (e.g. use of a [[universal Turing machine]]) and Bayes’ rule for prediction.&lt;ref&gt;Li and Vitanyi, 2008, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt;

Occam's razor and Epicurus' principle are essentially two different non-mathematical approximations of the [[universal prior]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

* Occam's razor: ''among the theories that are consistent with the observed phenomena, one should select the simplest theory''.&lt;ref&gt;Li and Vitanyi, 2008, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

* Epicurus' principle of multiple explanations: ''if more than one theory is consistent with the observations, keep all such theories''.&lt;ref&gt;Li and Vitanyi, 2008, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the heart of the universal prior is an abstract model of a computer, such as a [[universal Turing machine]].&lt;ref&gt;Hutter, M., [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Algorithmic_information_theory "Algorithmic Information Theory"], Scholarpedia, 2(3):2519.&lt;/ref&gt;   Any abstract computer will do, as long as it is Turing-complete, i.e. every finite binary string has at least one program that will compute it on the abstract computer.

The abstract computer is used to give precise meaning to the phrase "simple explanation" {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.  In the formalism used, explanations, or theories of phenomena, are computer programs that generate observation strings when run on the abstract computer. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} A simple explanation is a short computer program. A complex explanation is a long computer program. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}  Simple explanations are more likely, so a high-probability observation string is one generated
by a short computer program, or perhaps by any of a large number of slightly longer computer programs.  A low-probability observation string is one that can only be generated by a long computer program {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

These ideas can be made specific{{Examples|date=September 2017}} and the probabilities used to construct a prior probability
distribution for the given observation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}   Solomonoff's main reason for inventing this prior is so that it can be used in Bayes' rule when the actual prior is unknown, enabling prediction under uncertainty.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} It predicts the most likely continuation of that observation, and provides a measure of how likely this continuation will be.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Although the [[universal probability]] of an observation (and its extension) is incomputable, there is a computer algorithm, Levin Search, &lt;ref&gt;Levin, L.A., "Universal Search Problems", in Problemy Peredaci Informacii 9, pp. 115–116, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; which, when run for longer and longer periods of time, will generate a sequence of approximations which converge to the [[universal probability distribution]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Solomonoff proved this distribution to be 
machine-invariant within a constant factor (called the [[Kolmogorov complexity#Invariance theorem|invariance theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;Solomonoff, R., "[http://world.std.com/~rjs/publications/solo1.pdf Complexity-Based Induction Systems: Comparisons and Convergence Theorems],"
IEEE Trans. on Information Theory, Vol. IT-24, No. 4, pp. 422-432, July 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomonoff invented the concept of algorithmic probability with its associated invariance theorem around 1960,&lt;ref&gt;Solomonoff, R., [http://world.std.com/~rjs/barc97.pdf "The Discovery of Algorithmic Probability"], ''Journal of Computer and System Sciences'', Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 73-88, August 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; publishing a report on it: "A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference."&lt;ref&gt;Solomonoff, R., "[http://world.std.com/~rjs/z138.pdf A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference]", Report V-131, Zator Co., Cambridge, Ma. (Nov. 1960 revision of the Feb. 4, 1960 report).&lt;/ref&gt; He clarified these ideas more fully in 1964 with "A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference," Part I&lt;ref&gt;Solomonoff, R., "[http://world.std.com/~rjs/1964pt1.pdf A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference, Part I]". ''Information and Control'', Vol 7, No. 1 pp 1-22, March 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; and Part II.&lt;ref&gt;Solomonoff, R., "[http://world.std.com/~rjs/1964pt2.pdf A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference, Part II]" ''Information and Control'', Vol 7, No. 2 pp 224–254, June 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further discussion ==

Solomonoff described a universal computer with a randomly generated input program.  The program computes some possibly infinite output. The universal probability distribution is the probability distribution on all possible output strings with random input.&lt;ref&gt;Solomonoff, R., "[http://world.std.com/~rjs/kollect.pdf The Kolmogorov Lecture: The Universal Distribution and Machine Learning]" ''The Computer Journal'', Vol 46, No. 6 p 598, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The algorithmic probability of any given finite output prefix ''q'' is the sum of the probabilities of the programs that compute something starting with ''q''. Certain long objects with short programs have high probability.

Algorithmic probability is the main ingredient of [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference]], the theory of prediction based on observations; it was invented with the goal of using it for machine learning; given a sequence of symbols, which one will come next? Solomonoff's theory provides an answer that is optimal in a certain sense, although it is incomputable. Unlike, for example, [[Karl Popper]]'s informal inductive inference theory,{{clarify|reason=According to his wikipedia article, 'Popper is known for his rejection of the classical inductivist views on the scientific method'. Consequently, he didn't give an 'inductive inference theory'.|date=September 2015}}  Solomonoff's is mathematically rigorous.

Algorithmic probability is closely related to the concept of [[Kolmogorov complexity]].  Kolmogorov's introduction of complexity was motivated by information theory and problems in randomness, while Solomonoff introduced algorithmic complexity for a different reason: inductive reasoning. A single universal prior probability that can be substituted for each actual prior probability in Bayes’s rule was invented by Solomonoff with Kolmogorov complexity as a side product.&lt;ref&gt;Gács, P. and Vitányi, P., "In Memoriam Raymond J. Solomonoff", ''IEEE Information Theory Society Newsletter'', Vol. 61, No. 1, March 2011, p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomonoff's enumerable measure is [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] in a certain powerful sense, but the computation time can be infinite. One way of dealing with this issue is a variant of Leonid Levin's Search Algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;Levin, L.A., "Universal Search Problems", in Problemy Peredaci Informacii 9, pp. 115–116, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; which limits the time spent computing the success of possible programs, with shorter programs given more time.  Other methods of limiting the search space include training sequences.

== Definition ==

Applied Academics is an approach to learning which focuses on motivating and challenging students to connect what they learn with the world they experience and with what interests them. The basic premise is that if academic content is made more relevant, participatory and concrete, students learn better, retain more and apply learning in their lives. Teaching in this model uses hands-on innovative [[Teaching method|teaching methods]] sometimes called [[contextual learning]]. Teachers help students understand the reasons for studying their subject matter and capitalize on students' natural learning inclinations and problem-solving approaches they can use well beyond the classroom throughout their lives.&lt;ref name="Hocking"/&gt;

Applied Academics is an attempt to break from disconnected learning (where students go to different classes for different subjects for specified periods of time and don't gain a sense of the interconnectedness of [[learning]]) that has become a part of traditional approaches to education. This approach attempts to reintegrate learning by doing such things (for example) as teaching [[Mathematics|math]], [[science]], [[writing]], or speech within other contexts such as a learning experience dealing with some form of technology training.&lt;ref name="Hocking"/&gt;

== Research in cognitive science ==

[[Research]] in [[cognitive science]] has shown that learners are not passive receptacles into which knowledge may be "poured". Learning occurs when the learner constructs, invents, and [[Problem solving|solves problems]]. Studies have shown that students taught theoretical principles, processes and skills in isolation without practice do not transfer these skills and knowledge as well to real life situations. Although "learning to know," "learning to do," and their "application" are often separated, there is no effective learning or understanding of one kind without the other two.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relating to the SCANS Competencies==
In the United States the [[Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills]] (SCANS) states that "good jobs require people who can put knowledge to work", and listed the [[knowledge]] ([[Academia|academics]]) that it considered critical for all students to possess.&lt;ref name=SCANS&gt;

| accessdate = 2007-05-15}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

These competencies include:
* Knowing how to effectively allocate time, money, materials, space, and staff
* The ability to work on a team, teach, serve customers, lead, negotiate and work with people from culturally diverse backgrounds
* Understanding how to effectively acquire, evaluate, and use data 
* Understanding and ability to design and improve social, organizational, and technological systems
* The ability to effectively use technology

==Relating to action research==
The concept of [[action research]] is related to Applied Academics, as one tenet of action research is to discover theory through practice, and then implement using the foundation of theory.

'''Arp 187''' is a [[radio galaxy]] and [[galaxy merger|merger remnant]] located in the [[constellation]] [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]]. It is an interacting galaxy pair (MCG-02-13-040).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=arp+187+&amp;submit=SIMBAD+search |title=Simbad |accessdate=2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is included in the [[Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies]] in the category galaxies with narrow filaments.

The galaxy has two prominent radio lobes, however the emission of its [[Active galactic nucleus|AGN]] in [[X-ray]] is low, and so is the thermal output of the AGN torus as observed in [[infrared]], suggesting that it has been quenched. The detection of a narrow line region (with dimensions up to 10 kpc) with still active emission mean that the AGN was still active up to at least 10&lt;sup&gt;4-5&lt;/sup&gt; years ago. In the nucleus of Arp 187 is predicted to lie a [[supermassive black hole]] with estimated mass around 6.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; {{solar mass|link=yes}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ichikawa |first1=Kohei |last2=Ueda |first2=Junko |last3=Shidatsu |first3=Megumi |last4=Kawamuro |first4=Taiki |last5=Matsuoka |first5=Kenta |title=Signs of active galactic nucleus quenching in a merger remnant with radio jets |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan |date=1 February 2016 |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=9 |doi=10.1093/pasj/psv112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
An '''autoimmune disease''' is a condition arising from an abnormal [[immune response]] to a normal body part.&lt;ref name=NIH2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Autoimmune diseases fact sheet|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/autoimmune-diseases.html|website=OWH|accessdate=5 October 2016|date=16 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005144045/https://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/autoimmune-diseases.html|archivedate=5 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least 80 types of autoimmune diseases.&lt;ref name=NIH2012/&gt; Nearly any body part can be involved.&lt;ref name=Bor2010/&gt; Common symptoms include low grade [[fever]] and [[fatigue (medical)|feeling tired]].&lt;ref name=NIH2012/&gt; Often symptoms come and go.&lt;ref name=NIH2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause is generally unknown.&lt;ref name=Bor2010/&gt; Some autoimmune diseases such as [[lupus]] run in families, and certain cases may be triggered by [[infection]]s or other environmental factors.&lt;ref name=NIH2012/&gt; Some common diseases that are generally considered autoimmune include [[celiac disease]], [[diabetes mellitus type 1]], [[Graves' disease]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[psoriasis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and [[systemic lupus erythematosus]].&lt;ref name=NIH2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(15)00334-8| pmid=26724103|title = The search for the target antigens of multiple sclerosis, part 1: Autoreactive CD4+ T lymphocytes as pathogenic effectors and therapeutic targets| journal=The Lancet Neurology| volume=15| issue=2| pages=198–209|year = 2016|last1 = Hohlfeld|first1 = Reinhard| last2=Dornmair| first2=Klaus| last3=Meinl| first3=Edgar| last4=Wekerle| first4=Hartmut}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis can be difficult to determine.&lt;ref name=NIH2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and prognosis --&gt;
Treatment depends on the type and severity of the condition.&lt;ref name=NIH2012/&gt; [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) and [[immunosuppressants]] are often used.&lt;ref name=NIH2012/&gt; [[Intravenous immunoglobulin]] may also occasionally be used.&lt;ref name=Kat2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=U|last2=Shoenfeld|first2=Y|last3=Zandman-Goddard|first3=G|title=Update on intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) mechanisms of action and off- label use in autoimmune diseases.|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design|date=2011|volume=17|issue=29|pages=3166–75|pmid=21864262|doi=10.2174/138161211798157540}}&lt;/ref&gt; While treatment usually improves symptoms, they do not typically cure the disease.&lt;ref name=NIH2012/&gt;

==Definition==
{{See also|List of autoimmune diseases}}
For a disease to be regarded as an autoimmune disease it needs to answer to ''Witebsky's postulates'' (first formulated by [[Ernest Witebsky]] and colleagues in 1957 and modified in 1994):&lt;ref name=EW&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Witebsky E, Rose NR, Terplan K, Paine JR, Egan RW | title = Chronic thyroiditis and autoimmunization | journal = J.

* Direct evidence from transfer of disease-causing antibody or disease-causing [[T cell|T lymphocyte white blood cells]]
* Indirect evidence based on reproduction of the autoimmune disease in experimental animals
* Circumstantial evidence from clinical clues
* Genetic evidence suggesting "clustering" with other autoimmune diseases

==Signs and symptoms==
Autoimmune diseases have a wide variety of different effects. They do tend to have one of three characteristic pathological effects which characterize them as autoimmune diseases:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Autoimmune disorders: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000816.htm|website = www.nlm.nih.gov|access-date = 2016-01-21|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160112012705/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000816.htm|archivedate = 2016-01-12|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that autoimmune diseases are among the leading causes of death among women in the United States in all age groups up to 65 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walsh|first1=SJ|last2=Rau|first2=LM|title=Autoimmune diseases: a leading cause of death among young and middle-aged women in the United States.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=September 2000|volume=90|issue=9|pages=1463–6|pmid=10983209|pmc=1447637|doi=10.2105/ajph.90.9.1463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A substantial minority of the population suffers from these diseases, which are often chronic, debilitating, and life-threatening.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

There are more than 80 illnesses caused by autoimmunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000816.htm | title=MedlinePlus medical encyclopedia - autoimmune disorders | date=16 July 2014 | publisher=National Institutes of Health | accessdate=21 December 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105002152/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000816.htm | archivedate=5 January 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
The human [[immune system]] typically produces both [[T cell]]s and [[B cell]]s that are capable of being reactive with self-[[antigen]]s, but these self-reactive cells are usually either killed prior to becoming active within the immune system, placed into a state of anergy (silently removed from their role within the immune system due to over-activation), or removed from their role within the immune system by regulatory cells. When any one of these mechanisms fail, it is possible to have a reservoir of self-reactive cells that become functional within the immune system. The mechanisms of preventing self-reactive T cells from being created takes place through negative selection process within the [[thymus]] as the T cell is developing into a mature immune cell.

Some infections, such as ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'', have [[antigen]]s that are similar (but not identical) to our own self-molecules. In this case, a normal immune response to ''C. jejuni'' can result in the production of antibodies that also react to a lesser degree with receptors on skeletal muscle (i.e., [[myasthenia gravis]]). A major understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases has been the application of genome wide association scans that have identified a degree of genetic sharing among the autoimmune diseases.&lt;ref name="pmid23031829"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cotsapas C, Hafler DA | title = Immune-mediated disease genetics: the shared basis of pathogenesis | journal = Trends in Immunology | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–6 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23031829 | doi = 10.1016/j.it.2012.09.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autoimmunity]], on the other hand, is the presence of self-reactive immune response (e.g., auto-antibodies, self-reactive T cells), with or without damage or pathology resulting from it.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill Professional"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Harrisons-Principles-Internal-Medicine-Volumes/dp/007174889X|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine: Volumes 1 and 2, 18th Edition|date=2011-08-11|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=9780071748896|edition=18|language=English|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529230448/http://www.amazon.com/Harrisons-Principles-Internal-Medicine-Volumes/dp/007174889X|archivedate=2016-05-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be restricted to certain [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s (e.g. in [[autoimmune thyroiditis]]) or involve a particular tissue in different places (e.g. [[Goodpasture's disease]] which may affect the [[basement membrane]] in both the [[lung]] and the [[kidney]]).

There are many theories as to how an autoimmune disease state arises.  Some common ones are listed below.

===Cryptic determinants/molecular sequestration===
Although it is possible for a potential autoantigen to be spatially sequestered in an immune privileged site within the body (e.g. the eye), mechanisms exist to express even these antigens in a tolerogenic fashion to the immune system.  However, it is impossible to induce tolerance (immune unresponsiveness) to all aspects of an autoantigen.  This is because under normal physiologic conditions some regions of a self-antigen are not expressed at a sufficient level to induce tolerance. These poorly displayed areas of an antigen are called "cryptic determinants." The immune system maintains a high-affinity repertoire to the cryptic self because the presentation of these determinants was insufficient to induce strong tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gammon G, Sercarz E | title = How some T cells escape tolerance induction | journal = Nature | volume = 342 | pages = 6246 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2478888 | doi=10.1038/342183a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular mimicry===
The concept of molecular mimicry describes a situation in which a foreign antigen can initiate an immune response in which a T or B cell component cross-recognizes self.  The cross reactive immune response is responsible for the autoimmune disease state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wucherpfennig KW, Strominger JL | title = Molecular mimicry in T cell-mediated autoimmunity: viral peptides activate human T cell clones specific for myelin basic protein. | journal = Cell | volume = 80 | issue = 5 | pages = 695–705 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7534214 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90348-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-reactive immune responses to self were first described for antibodies.

===Altered glycan theory===
According to this theory the effector function of the immune response is mediated by the [[glycans]] (polysaccharides) displayed by the cells and humoral components of the immune system.  Individuals with autoimmunity have alterations in their glycosylation profile such that a proinflammatory immune response is favored.  It is further hypothesized that individual autoimmune diseases will have unique glycan signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maverakis E, Kim K, Shimoda M, Gershwin M, Patel F, Wilken R, Raychaudhuri S, Ruhaak LR, Lebrilla CB | title = Glycans in the immune system and The Altered Glycan Theory of Autoimmunity | journal = J Autoimmun | volume = 57 | issue = 6 | pages = 1–13 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25578468 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaut.2014.12.002 | pmc=4340844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hygiene hypothesis===
According to the [[hygiene hypothesis]], high levels of cleanliness expose children to fewer antigens than in the past, causing their immune systems to become overactive and more likely to misidentify own tissues as foreign, resulting in autoimmune conditions such as asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rook|first1=Graham A. W.|title=Hygiene Hypothesis and Autoimmune Diseases|journal=Clinical Reviews in Allergy &amp; Immunology|date=17 November 2011|volume=42|issue=1|pages=5–15|doi=10.1007/s12016-011-8285-8|pmid=22090147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The first estimate of US prevalence for autoimmune diseases as a group was published in 1997 by Jacobson, et al. They reported US prevalence to be around 9 million, applying prevalence estimates for 24 diseases to a US population of 279 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobson|first1=DL|last2=Gange|first2=SJ|last3=Rose|first3=NR|last4=Graham|first4=NM|title=Epidemiology and estimated population burden of selected autoimmune diseases in the United States.|journal=Clinical immunology and immunopathology|date=September 1997|volume=84|issue=3|pages=223–43|pmid=9281381|doi=10.1006/clin.1997.4412}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jacobson's work was updated by Hayter &amp; Cook in 2012.&lt;ref name=HayterCook2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayter|first1=SM|last2=Cook|first2=MC|title=Updated assessment of the prevalence, spectrum and case definition of autoimmune disease.|journal=Autoimmunity reviews|date=August 2012|volume=11|issue=10|pages=754–65|doi=10.1016/j.autrev.2012.02.001|pmid=22387972}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study used Witebsky's postulates, as revised by Rose &amp; Bona,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=NR|last2=Bona|first2=C|title=Defining criteria for autoimmune diseases (Witebsky's postulates revisited)|journal=Immunology Today|date=September 1993|volume=14|issue=9|pages=426–30|pmid=8216719|doi=10.1016/0167-5699(93)90244-F}}&lt;/ref&gt; to extend the list to 81 diseases and estimated overall cumulative US prevalence for the 81 autoimmune diseases at 5.0%, with 3.0% for males and 7.1% for females. The estimated community
prevalence, which takes into account the observation that many people have more than one autoimmune disease, was 4.5% overall, with 2.7% for males and 6.4% for females.&lt;ref name=HayterCook2012/&gt;

==Research==
In both autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, the condition arises through aberrant reactions of the human adaptive or innate immune systems. In autoimmunity, the patient's immune system is activated against the body's own proteins. In chronic inflammatory diseases, [[neutrophil]]s and other [[White blood cell|leukocytes]] are constitutively recruited by [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s, leading to tissue damage.

Mitigation of inflammation by activation of anti-inflammatory genes and the suppression of inflammatory genes in immune cells is a promising therapeutic approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mukundan L, Odegaard JI, Morel CR, Heredia JE, Mwangi JW, Ricardo-Gonzalez RR, Goh YP, Eagle AR, Dunn SE |date=Nov 2009 | title = PPAR-delta senses and orchestrates clearance of apoptotic cells to promote tolerance | url = | journal = Nat Med | volume = 15 | issue = 11| pages = 1266–72 | doi=10.1038/nm.2048 | pmid=19838202 | pmc=2783696|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roszer T, Menéndez-Gutiérrez MP, Lefterova MI, Alameda D, Núñez V, Lazar MA, Fischer T, Ricote M |date=Jan 2011 | title = Autoimmune kidney disease and impaired engulfment of apoptotic cells in mice with macrophage peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma or retinoid X receptor alpha deficiency | url = | journal = J Immunol | volume = 186 | issue = 1| pages = 621–31 | doi=10.4049/jimmunol.1002230 | pmid=21135166| pmc=4038038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22155015"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh RP, Waldron RT, Hahn BH | title = Genes, tolerance and systemic autoimmunity | journal = Autoimmunity Reviews | volume = 11 | issue = 9 | pages = 664–9 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22155015 | pmc = 3306516 | doi = 10.1016/j.autrev.2011.11.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a body of evidence that once the production of [[autoantibody|autoantibodies]] has been initialized, autoantibodies have the capacity to maintain their own production.&lt;ref name="pmid12911286"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Böhm I |title=Disruption of the cytoskeleton after apoptosis induction by autoantibodies |journal=Autoimmunity |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=183–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12911286 |doi=10.1080/0891693031000105617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Traditionally it was believed that the immune system was unable to react against the body's own tissues, a concept described by the German immunologist [[Paul Ehrlich]] as "horror autotoxicus". In 1904 this theory was challenged by the discovery of a substance in the serum of patients with [[paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria]] that reacted with red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moticka|first1=Edward J.|title=Historical perspective on evidence-based immunology|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishing|isbn=9780123983817|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]],  '''blocking''' refers to the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] phenomenon in which a possible form for a word cannot surface because it is "blocked" by another form whose features are the most appropriate to the surface form's environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jack C. Richards et. al |title=Longman Dictionary of Language Teaching and Applied Linguistics |year=2005 |publisher=Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press |location=Beijing |isbn=978-7-5600-4882-6 |pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; More basically, it may also be construed as the "non-occurrence of one form due to the simple existence of another."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Word Formation in Generative Grammar|last = Aronoff|first = Mark|publisher = MIT Press|year = 1976|isbn = 0-262-51017-0|location = Cambridge, MA.|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Word formation]] employs processes such as the [[plural|plural marker]] in English ''s'' or ''es'' (e.g. ''dog'' and ''dogs'' or ''wish'' and ''wishes''). This plural marker is not, however, acceptable on the word ''child'' (as in *''childs''), because it is "blocked" by the presence of the competing form ''children'', which in this case inherits features from an older morphological process.

Blocking may also prevent the formation of words with existing synonyms, particularly if the blocked form is morphologically complex and the existing synonym is morphologically simple, e.g. *''stealer'' which is blocked by the existing simple form ''thief''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40311603|title=Morphological productivity : structural constraints in English derivation|last=Ingo.|first=Plag,|date=1999|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|isbn=3110158337|location=Berlin|oclc=40311603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One possible approach to blocking effects is that of distributed morphology, which asserts that [[Semantics|semantic]] and [[syntactic]] features create slots or cells in which items can appear. Blocking happens when one cell is engaged by one form as opposed to another. Blocking has been explained along two primary dimensions: the size of the blocking object, and the existence of [[grammar|ungrammatical]] forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Architecture and Blocking |last1=Embick |first1=David |last2=Marantz |first2=Alec |date=Winter 2008 |journal=Linguistic Inquiry |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=1–53 |publisher=The MIT Press |issn=1530-9150 |accessdate=September 18, 2011 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/linguistic_inquiry/v039/39.1embick.pdf |doi=10.1162/ling.2008.39.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Browns Glacier''' ({{Coord|68|56|S|78|0|E|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a small [[glacier]] {{convert|4|nmi|km|0}} north of [[Chaos Glacier]], flowing westward into the northern extremity of [[Ranvik Bay]]. The glacier was charted by Norwegian cartographers from air photographs taken by the [[Lars Christensen Expedition]] (1936–37), and was further identified in [[John H. Roscoe]]'s 1952 study of this area from [[U.S. Navy]] [[Operation Highjump]] (1946–47) photography. It was named by Roscoe for Lieutenant (j.g.) [[Eduardo P. Brown]], U.S. Navy, photographic officer with the western task group of Operation Highjump.&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23661">'''Central place foraging''' ('''CPF''') theory is an [[evolutionary ecology]] model for analyzing how an organism can maximize [[foraging]] rates while traveling through a patch (a discreet resource concentration), but maintains the key distinction of a forager traveling from a home base to a distant foraging location rather than simply passing through an area or travelling at random.  CPF was initially developed to explain how red-winged blackbirds might maximize energy returns when traveling to and from a nest.&lt;ref name="Orians" /&gt; The model has been further refined and used by anthropologists studying [[human behavioral ecology]] and [[archaeology]].&lt;ref name="Metcalfe" /&gt;

== Case studies ==

=== Central place foraging in non-human animals ===

Orians and Pearson (1979) found that [[red-winged blackbird]]s in eastern [[Washington state|Washington State]] tend to capture a larger number of single species prey items per trip compared to the same species in [[Costa Rica]], which brought back large, single insects.&lt;ref name="Orians" /&gt; Foraging specialization by Costa Rican blackbirds was attributed to increased search and handling costs of [[nocturnal]] foraging, whereas birds in Eastern Washington forage [[Diurnality|diurnally]] for prey with lower search and handling costs. Studies with [[sea birds]] and [[Pinniped|seals]] have also found that load size tends to increase with foraging distance from the nest, as predicted by CPF.&lt;ref name="Costa" /&gt; Other central place foragers, such as [[social insects]], also show support for CPF theory. [[Western honey bee|European honeybees]] increase their nectar load as travel time to nectar sites from a hive increases.&lt;ref name="Kacelnik" /&gt; [[North American Beaver|Beavers]] have been found to preferentially collect larger diameter trees as distance from their lodge increases.&lt;ref name="Fryxell" /&gt;

=== Archaeological case study: acorns and mussels in California ===

To apply the central place foraging model to [[ethnographic]] and [[experimental archaeology|experimental archaeological]] data driven by [[Middle-range theory (archaeology)|middle range theory]], Bettinger et al. (1997) simplify the Barlow and Metcalf (1996) central place model to explore the archaeological implications of [[acorn]] (''Quercus kelloggii'') and [[mussel]] (''Mytilus californianus'') procurement and processing.&lt;ref name="Bettinger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barlow" /&gt;  This model assumes foragers are gathering resources at a distance from their central place with the goal of efficiently returning the resource home. Travel time is expected to determine the degree to which foragers will process a resource in order to increase its utility prior to returning from a foraging location to their central place.
Transport capabilities in aboriginal California were established by measuring the volume of burden [[Basket weaving#Californian and Great Basin|baskets]] and extrapolating the load weight based on ethnographic data on basket use.

Ethnographic and experimental data was used to estimate utility at each possible stage of processing.
Examining [[ecology]] and procurement methods, the central place foraging model was used to predict the conditions in which field processing of the two species will occur.
* Acorn: Most stages of acorn processing are extremely time consuming but only marginally increase utility, therefore the central place foraging model predicts that acorns should only be dried prior to transporting to central place. Further processing of acorns (cracking, shucking, and winnowing) only increases efficiency when foragers’ one way travel time reaches 25 hours. This corresponds to approximately 124.75&amp;nbsp;km, which exceeds the territory size of native groups in California dependent on acorns.
* Mussels: When foragers employ the plucking harvesting method, field processing is expected even with short travel distances, as the shell to meat ratio allows forager to increase efficiency by removing shell. Stripping will almost always result in central place processing, rather than field processing, as this harvesting method results in the procurement of a high percentage of small mussels with high shell to meat ratios.

An understanding of central place foraging has implications for studying archaeological site formation. Variability of remains at sites can tell us about mobility – whether or not groups are central place foragers, what resource they’re mapping on to, and their degree of mobility. Based on central place foraging application for the processing of mussels and acorns, Bettinger et al. (1997) make several predictions for archaeological expectations.&lt;ref name="Bettinger" /&gt;   The study shows that procurement with field processing is more costly compared to foraging and processing resources residentially. These results imply that highly mobile foragers will establish a home base in close proximity to staple resources, and all processing of those resources will be done residentially. Less residentially mobile populations would in turn only be mapped onto a few resources, and would be expected to field process non-local resources on logistical procurement forays at greater distances from their central place. Processing debris from archaeological sites should reflect changes in mobility.

* Acorns: Sites where the [[Archaeobotany|archaeobotanical]] remains are dominated by acorn can be assumed to be seasonal sites of highly mobile foragers that have mapped on to acorns for seasonal processing. Sites that have a mix of archaeobotanical remains with a decreased abundance in acorn remains and plant material that would be lost in early stages of field processing are interpreted as less residentially mobile settlements characterized by logistical procurement.
* Mussels: Interpretation of archaeological mussel shell is complicated because it is reliant on the condition of the mussel beds, distance to the mussel beds and the type of harvest method being employed.  In general, however, sites closer to mussel beds should have larger mussel shell due to plucking and residential consumption. Sites far from mussel procurement beds would be expected to have a mix of mussel shell sizes due to stripping. The presence of higher amounts of small mussel shell could also indicate and increase in resource intensification.

=== Archaeological case study: silver miners and propaganda in Colorado ===

Glover (2009) used a CPF model to determine if late nineteenth century silver miners near [[Gothic, Colorado|Gothic]], [[Colorado]] were choosing mine locations efficiently given the costs of transporting [[silver ore]] to the mill, the value of silver, and the amount of silver per kilogram of ore.&lt;ref name=Glover /&gt; Estimates of the costs associated with transport were obtained using research from [[physiology]] to determine the most energetically efficient load size. Newspaper articles were used to determine the hourly wage that a miner could be making if they worked in town instead. Newspapers were also used to estimate the value of silver at that time, and estimates of the amount of silver per kilogram of ore were obtained through records from area silver mills, as well as through newspapers. These differed, with the newspapers optimistically claiming that silver deposits were far more productive than the more accurate mill records demonstrated.

These estimates were used to determine the optimal placement of mines. A number of historic mining locations were recorded using [[GPS]]. These data were used to calculate least cost paths from the mines to Gothic, which provided the distances to the central place. The results were compared to two different CPF models based on newspaper [[propaganda]] and the more realistic mill records, respectively.

Miners were choosing locations that were much further away than feasible given the value of silver and its actual abundance. However, the mines were within the distance predicted using the optimistic newspaper estimates. Glover suggested that miners, being new to the area, used [[Observational learning|social learning]] strategies and based their decisions on newspaper propaganda and rumors, rather than individual experience. Therefore, they chose locations that were too far away to be economically viable.

=== Ethnographic case study: shellfish in Torres Strait Islands ===

Shellfish exemplify the resources targeted by the CPF model – those with a heavy, bulky,
low utility component (e.g. shell) surrounding a smaller, lighter high utility component
(e.g. meat). If foragers differentially field process and transport shellfish prey items,
analyses of [[midden]] composition may incorrectly estimate the importance of some species
and their relative contribution to prehistoric diets. Using foraging data from the Meriam
of Australia, Bird and Bliege Bird (1997) compare observed shellfish field acquisition to
shell deposition at residential sites, and test the hypotheses of the CPF model.&lt;ref name="Bird" /&gt;

The [[Meriam people|Meriam]] inhabit [[Torres Strait Islands]] of Australia, are of Melanesian descent, and
have strong cultural and historical ties to New Guinea. They continue to harvest marine
resources such as sea turtles, fishes, squid, and shellfish. Bird and Bliege Bird conducted
“focal individual foraging follows” of 33 children, 16 men and 42 women during
[[intertidal]] foraging bouts on [[Reef flat#Reef flat|reef flats]] and [[Rocky shore|rock shores]]. Foraging technology includes 10-
liter plastic buckets, long-blade knives, and hammers. Foragers are constrained by time
(2–4 hours at low tide) and load size (10-liter bucket).

Large clams (''[[Hippopus hippopus]]'' and ''[[Tridacna|Tridacna spp.]]'') collected on the reef flat constitute
over half of the edible weight collected, but since they are almost always field processed
their shells only make up 10% of the residential site deposition. In contrast, [[Psammobiidae|sunset clams]]
(''Asaphis violascens'') and [[nerites]] (''Nerita undata'') are usually processed residentially.
Large clams were, therefore, underrepresented while small clams and nerites were
overrepresented in the reconstructed diet.

Since reef flat and rocky shore foraging occurs at multiple sites at variable distances from the residential camp, the authors calculated the mean one-way travel distance processing threshold (&lt;math&gt;z_{d1}&lt;/math&gt;, in meters) for each species. The CPF model accurately predicts
field processing for the majority of reef flat foraging events for bivalves. ''Hippopus'' and
''Tridacna'' have small processing threshold distances (&lt;math&gt;z_{d1}&lt;/math&gt; = 74.6 and 137 respectively),
and no shell is returned to camp at distances beyond 150 meters. Women’s fit nears
100%, but children and men made the optimal choice less frequently because they usually
forage for shellfish opportunistically, and therefore do not always carry the appropriate
processing technology.

For [[gastropods]] (''[[Lambis lambis]]'', &lt;math&gt;z_{d1}&lt;/math&gt; = 278.7), the model accurately predicts processing
only 58-59% of the time. This could in part be due to a preference for cooking some species inside of their shells (i.e. the shell has some utility), or also because some prey items are prepared at “dinner-time camps” rather than the residential camp. ''A. violascens'' and ''N. undata'' are never field processed, consistent with their large processing threshold distances (2418.5 and 5355.7 respectively).

Overall, prey types that were difficult or inefficient to process and/or were collected near the residential or temporary camp were not field processed. Species that required little processing time to increase returns and/or were collected far from camp were field
processed. The field processing predictions of the CPF model might be incorrect where shellfish are transported whole in order to maintain freshness for later consumption or trade, or where the shell itself is valuable.

=== Ethnoarchaeological case study: pickleweed and piñon ===

Barlow and Metcalfe (1996) address the issues of field processing of plant materials.&lt;ref name="Barlow" /&gt; Decisions
of central place foragers may confound archaeological interpretations about the contribution plant
material to the diet. Two interrelated issues are pertinent: the location of the central place, and field
processing.

Barlow and Metcalfe study archaeological materials from two sites, [[Danger Cave]] and Hogup Cave, in the
area of the [[Great Salt Lake]]. These sites contain evidence for the use of [[piñon pine]]
(''Pinus monophylla'') and pickleweed (''[[Allenrolfea occidentalis]]'').

Samples were obtained for experimental processing from extant piñon groves and pickleweed patches
in the vicinity as the cave sites. Piñon and pickleweed were harvested and processed in carefully timed
and controlled stages. After each stage the useful, i.e. edible, portion of the remaining material was
weighed and recorded before proceeding to the next stage. Stages consisted of: gathering, drying, and
a variety of processes (parching, hulling, winnowing, etc.) to remove inedible constituents. Caloric
values of the samples were then determined via laboratory analysis. These values, as well as assumed
load sizes from 3 to 15&amp;nbsp;kg (based on ethnographic burden basket sizes) were then used to generate field
processing model predictions.

At a distance of 15 kilometers from the central place, the estimated net return rates for field processing loads of piñon and pickleweed are 3,000 and 190 calories per hour, respectively. Since piñon has higher overall return rates, field processing produces a higher rate of return. Because pickleweed has a lower rate of return, it is not worthwhile to spend the additional effort required for field processing.
Therefore, the central place will be situated closer to pickleweed patches than to piñon in order to more effectively exploit the lower-ranked resource.

These results imply that the archaeological evidence for pickleweed at the cave may over estimate its actual contribution to the diet. If foragers choose to reside closer to pickleweed patches and bring back largely unprocessed plants, a high density of pickleweed  [[macrofossil]]s will be incorporated into site deposits. However, the opposite is true for piñon, which is largely processed in the field. Thus, most sites will contain little macrofossil evidence of the inedible portions of piñon that could later be recovered by archaeologists. As such, the relative abundance of macrofossils in most cases does not directly translate into the relative contribution of those resources to the diet of central place foragers.

== The model ==

=== Basic math: single stage of processing ===
[[File:Utility Curve.png|thumb|The effect of flattening the utility curve, &lt;math&gt;U(t)&lt;/math&gt; whilekeeping constant procurement and processing times &lt;math&gt;(x_0,x_1)&lt;/math&gt;. When the difference between field processing and transporting whole items &lt;math&gt;(y_1,y_0)&lt;/math&gt; is reduced, we should expect an increase in the transport time atwhich processing will occur. A forager should process items when transport time from a central place exceeds this threshold. (Adapted from Metcalfe and Barlow 1992.)]]
The goal of the field processing model is for a forager to maximize its return rate per roundtrip from home base to patch. The model typically solves for some amount of travel time that makes it worthwhile to process a resource to a certain stage. To determine this, we need to relate the benefit of processing and the time spent processing to the travel time. We let

&lt;math&gt;z=&lt;/math&gt; point on transport-time axis where field processing become profitable

&lt;math&gt;x_0=&lt;/math&gt; time to procure unprocessed resources

&lt;math&gt;x_1=&lt;/math&gt; time to procure and process a load of resources

&lt;math&gt;y_0=&lt;/math&gt; utility of load without field processing

&lt;math&gt;y_1=&lt;/math&gt; utility of load with field processing

The relationship is then specified by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;z=\frac{y_0x_1-y_1x_0}{y_1-y_0}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

With values for the utility and time of processed &lt;math&gt;(y_1,x_1)&lt;/math&gt; and unprocessed loads &lt;math&gt;(y_0,x_0)&lt;/math&gt;, we can solve for &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. The right hand side of the equation is the proportion of relative utility*time to utility. 
	Two conditions must be satisfied. First, the processed load must have higher utility than the unprocessed load. Second, the return rate of the unprocessed load must be at least as good as the return rate for the processed load. Formally,

# 
&lt;center&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;x_1&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;y_1&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/center&gt;

#
&lt;center&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;y_1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\frac{y_0}{x_0}\geq\frac{y_1}{x_1}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Multiple components and multiple stages of processing ===

Many resources have multiple components that can be removed during processing to increase utility. Multistage field processing models provide a way to calculate travel thresholds for each stage when a resource has more than one component. As one increases the utility per load, the time needed to procure a complete load increases.

The benefit of each stage of processing is:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y_j=\frac{\sum_{i\in s_j}A_iB_i}{\sum_{i\in s_j}B_i}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;A_j=&lt;/math&gt;utility of resource component ''j''

&lt;math&gt;B_j=&lt;/math&gt;proportion of package composed of resource component ''j'' prior to processing

&lt;math&gt;y_j=&lt;/math&gt;utility of load at field-processing stage ''j''

The cost in terms of time for each stage of processing is:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x_j=\left(\frac{L}{P\sum_{i\in s_j}B_i}\right)\left(M+\sum_{i\notin s_j}D_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;D_j=&lt;/math&gt;time required to remove resource component ''j''

&lt;math&gt;L=&lt;/math&gt;weight of optimal load size for transport

&lt;math&gt;P=&lt;/math&gt;weight of unmodified resource package

&lt;math&gt;M=&lt;/math&gt;time required to handle each resource package

&lt;math&gt;x_j=&lt;/math&gt;total handling and processing time required to reach each stage ''j'' of processing

Now these values can be used to calculate &lt;math&gt;z_j&lt;/math&gt;, which is the travel threshold for processing to stage ''j''. In addition to a resource with multiple components, this same model generalizes to a resource with multiple stages, each of which is composed of multiple resources, each of which can be removed independently of each other (i.e., with no additional cost). This model can be further generalized to the case where multiple components with additional costs can be removed in multiple stages of processing through recursion.

=== Assumptions ===
[[File:Transport Decay Curve.png|thumb|Transport decay curves demonstrate the reduction in return rates (cal/hour) experienced by a central place forager as a function of round trip travel time. The travel threshold from field processing models, &lt;math&gt;z_j&lt;/math&gt; represents the travel time at which processing to the next stage will provide higher return rates, which is indicated by the
intersection of the decay curves for two sequential stages of processing. The shaded areas represent the optimal extent of processing
as travel time increases.&lt;ref name="Barlow" /&gt;]]
This model rests on a number of assumptions. The most important are listed here. 
* Individuals attempt to maximize their rate of delivery per round trip * Packages have at least two components with different utilities
* The optimal load size is less than or equal to the resources available
* Time spent away from camp comes with an [[opportunity cost]], but time spent in camp does not. So there is no cost to processing in camp. 

=== Predictions ===

There are three key predictions from the field processing model.
# The amount an individual is willing to process is proportional to traveling time. This is evident in &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; in the equation above. Since &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of time it takes an individual to process something to an additional stage, and this is independent of the amount of time it takes one to initially procure the resources, and since &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; is positive, then increasing it will result in an increase in &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.
# If processing results in a greater benefit, then one will not need to travel as far to make processing worthwhile. This is clear to see because, as long as condition 2 holds, &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; is larger than &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt;. So that part of the equation will be negative. Therefore, if we hold everything else the same and increase the benefit due to processing, the travel time required to make processing viable will decrease.
# Field processing can increase the amount of time that an individual is willing to pursue a prey. If processing a prey item results in a big enough benefit, you will spend longer capturing it. We can see this by looking at where &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is in this model. Since it interacts with the benefit due to processing, a change in either of those can alter &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.

Transport decay curves demonstrate the reduction in return rates (cal/hour) experienced by a central place forager as a function of round trip travel time.

'''Esri CityEngine''' is a [[three-dimensional]] (3D) [[3d modeling|model]]ing software application developed by [[Esri]] R&amp;D Center Zurich (formerly Procedural Inc.) and is specialized in the generation of 3D [[urban environment]]s. With the [[procedural modeling]] approach, CityEngine supports the creation of detailed large-scale 3D city models. CityEngine works with architectural object placement and arrangement in the same manner that [[E-on Vue|VUE]] manages terrain, ecosystems and atmosphere mapping. Unlike the traditional 3D modeling methodology which is using [[Computer-aided design|Computer-Aided Design (CAD)]] tools, CityEngine improves the shape generation via the rule-based system and data sets—similar as the [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System (GIS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nae-Young|first=Choei|date=April 1, 2016|title=Procedural Modeling of a Residential Site Using the Interoperability between the GIS and CityEngine|url=https://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=15f46927-cb0a-4a18-b27b-987a24d250a4%40sessionmgr4009&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=115375340&amp;db=aci|journal=GSTF Journal of Engineering Technology|volume=3| issue = 4|pages=4–10|via=Applied Science &amp; Technology Source}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this dominant feature, CityEngine has been broadly used in academic research or building virtual environments, e.g., [[urban planning]], [[architecture]], [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]], [[game development]], [[entertainment]], [[GIS]], [[archeology]], and [[cultural heritage]]. After being integrated with the [[Building information modeling|Building Information Model (BIM)]], CityEngine can visualize the data of buildings in a larger urban context, enhancing its working scenario toward real construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2016/09/22/bim-gis-integration-with-ifc/|title=BIM-GIS Integration with IFC|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software ===
CityEngine was developed at [[ETH Zurich]] by the original author Pascal Mueller, co-founder and CEO of Procedural Inc. During his PhD research at [http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/ ETH Computer Vision Lab], Mueller invented a number of techniques for [[procedural modeling]] of 3D architectural content which make up the foundation of CityEngine. Since CityEngine's public debut in the 2001 [[Siggraph]] conference,&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/felix11/OpenPCG/blob/master/literature/procedural_modeling_of_cities__siggraph2001.pdf ''Procedural Modeling of Cities'' - Yoav Parish and Pascal Mueller (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; additional research papers have contributed to featuring CityEngine. In 2008, the first commercial version of CityEngine was released by the Swiss company Procedural Inc and was used by professionals in [[urban planning]], [[architecture]], [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]], [[game development]], [[entertainment]], [[GIS]], [[archeology]], and [[cultural heritage]].

==Features==
'''Procedural Modeling Core (CGA Shape Grammar Language):''' CGA ([[computer generated architecture]]) rules allow to control mass, geometry assets, proportions, or texturing of buildings or streets on a citywide scale. (''More details can be seen in the "Procedural Modeling" section.'')

'''Get Map Data:''' Users can create a 3D urban environment in few minutes via the download helper; Users can select a target location and import geo-referenced satellite imagery and 3D terrain of that place. If they are available in the [[OpenStreetMap]] (OSM), the data of street and building footprint can be easily retrieved to build 3D models via default CGA rules.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/cityengine/latest/get-started/cityengine-2016-release-notes.htm|title=CityEngine 2016.0 release notes—Esri CityEngine {{!}} ArcGIS Desktop|website=desktop.arcgis.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GIS/CAD Data Support:''' Support for industry-standard formats such as Esri Shapefile, File Geodatabase and [[OpenStreetMap]] which allow to import/export any geo-spatial/vector data.

'''Parametric Modeling Interface:''' An interface to interactively control specific street or building parameters, such as the height or age (defined by the CGA rules)

'''Dynamic City Layouts:''' Interactive design, editing and modification of urban layouts consisting of (curved) streets, blocks and parcels.

'''Map-Controlled City Modeling:''' Global control of buildings and street parameters through image maps (for example the building heights or the landuse-mix).

'''Street Networks Patterns:''' Street grow tools to design and construct urban layouts.

'''Industry-Standard 3D Formats:''' CityEngine supports Collada, Autodesk FBX, 3DS, Wavefront OBJ, RenderMan RIB, mental ray MI and e-on software's Vue.

'''Custom Report Generation:''' Users can script and generate rule-based reports to show social-economic figures (e.g., [[Gross Floor Area]] (GFA), [[Floor area ratio|Floor Area Ratio]] (FAR)) and to analyze their urban design proposals.

'''3D Web Scene Export:''' The model built in CityEngine can be directly exported and then used to create a [[WebGL]] scene in a browser. The 3D environment in the web scene can be rotated, explored, compared and commented online by multiple users.

'''360 VR Experience:''' The scenarios of urban environments can be used to generate a series of panoramic photos for publishing them online. Users can look around by turning their heads in virtual reality (VR) headsets. (Currently, it only supports Samsung Oculus Gear)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cehelp.esri.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.procedural.cityengine.help/html/manual/export/vr360/export_formats_3vr.html|title=360 VR Experience Helper page|last=|first=|date=|website=Esri.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Python Scripting Interface:''' CityEngine provides ce.py as a built-in library.

'''Facade Wizard:''' Rule creator and visual facade authoring tool.

'''3D Format Support for Game Engines (VR/AR):''' Now the model built in CityEngine can be directly exported to Unreal Engine, with the loading capacity of tens of millions of polygons and tens of thousands of objects, as well as non-limited material textures. Meanwhile, exporting to Unity3D still requires users to use Autodesk [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]] as a transfer station.

'''Available for All Platforms:''' Available for Windows (64bit only), Mac OS X (64bit), and Linux (32/64bit).

==Procedural Modeling==
CityEngine uses a [[procedural modeling]] approach to automatically generate models through a predefined rule set. The rules are defined through a CGA [[shape grammar]] system enabling the creation of complex parametric models. Users can change or add the shape grammar as much as needed providing room for new designs.

Modeling an urban environment within CityEngine can start out with creating a street network either with the street drawing tool or with data imported from openstreetmap.org or from Esri data formats such as [[Shapefiles]] or [[File Geodatabase]]. The next step is to subdivide all the lots as many times as specified resulting in a map of lots and streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.procedural.com/cityengine/examples/new-york-city-2259.html New York example]&lt;/ref&gt; By selecting all or some of the lots CityEngine can be instructed to start generating the buildings. Due to the procedural modeling technology, all buildings can be made to vary from one another to achieve an urban aesthetic. At this point the city model can be re-designed and adjusted by changing parameters or the shape grammar itself.

CGA Shape Grammar system can read Esri-Oracle format datasets directly, and it operates as a top-bottom generation tree: it generates complex components from simple Shapefiles polygons/poly-lines/points whereas each branch and leaf of the generation tree cannot interact with others. It is different than main-stream shape grammars like [[Grasshopper 3D|Grasshopper]] in [[Rhinoceros 3D]] and Dynamo in [[Autodesk Revit]].

== Relevant applications ==
Traditionally, building a 3D urban environment is very time-consuming resulted from numerous buildings and details of a city. Designers used CAD software to create shapes one by one, and researchers analyzed cities by computing 2D information in GIS (GIS only supports limited 3D shape generation like extrusion.) CityEngine's Procedural Modeling system makes it possible to generate complex 3D models via information massively, bringing a large number of relevant applications. It not only enhances the workflow of urban design/study/planning and merges to a new field of study called Geodesign (means using geospatial information to design a city), but also lowers the threshold of making city environments in game and movie industry.

===Geodesign===
Discussions on [[geodesign]] often mention the use of Esri CityEngine,&lt;ref&gt;http://video.esri.com/watch/2116/the-instant-citygeodesign-and-urban-planning&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not an analytical tool like [[GIS]]. As a crucial tool to enhance 3D shape generation in ArcGIS, Esri CityEngine is the critical product to improve the applicability of GeoDesign, using geospatial information to design or analyze a city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esri.com/products/arcgis-capabilities/geodesign/overview|title=GeoDesign Overview {{!}} Esri|last=|first=|date=|website=Esri.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban Design and Planning ===
[[Garsdale Design]] were early pioneers of Esri CityEngine in the creation of city master plans in Iraq pre-2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/aug/26/yorkshire-dales-family-designing-cities-in-iraq|title=

Before using that, it took them numerous work hours on creating interactive visualizations of hundred thousands of buildings. With CityEngine, the designers and clients of projects can communicate via craft fluid, data-rich, and real-time rendered experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/cityengine/latest/get-started/cityengine-whats-new.htm|title=Visibility Analysis tools for planners|last=Zoog|first=Christopher|date=|website=Esri.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban Study ===
Due to its dominant feature in building informative city models, urban researchers are using CityEngine to compare [[Land use|land-use]] planning schemes, starting from the densest global cities such as Hong Kong and Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=Jian|date=July 2017|title=A study of plot ratio/building height restrictions in high density cities using 3D spatial analysis technology: A case in Hong Kong|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397515303465?|journal=Habitat International|volume=65|pages=13–31|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.habitatint.2017.04.012|hdl=10397/69923}}&lt;/ref&gt; When urban designers/planners enjoy the quantitive analyst, environmental scientists also like the instant 3D model generation in CityEngine, leading to more convenient informative research out of the time-consumption on creating a city from each building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choei|first=Nae-Young|date=April 2016|title=Procedural Modeling of a Residential Site Using the Interoperability between the GIS and CityEngine: An Adaptation of the Radburn Type Cul-de-sac Roadsystem and Housing|url=https://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=f1cb27b0-bfcf-491a-8034-9f7e850331df%40pdc-v-sessmgr01|journal=Journal of Engineering Technology|volume=3|pages=4|via=GSTF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Qing|date=July 2017|title=Robust point cloud classification based on multi-level semantic relationships for urban scenes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271616305445?|journal=Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing|volume=129|pages=86–102|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2017.04.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Game Development ===
Triple-A Games require detailed 3D environments to assign interactive scripts, causing CityEngine's participation in the creation of game scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Bernhard|date=2016|title=Managing the Scalability of Visual Exploration Using Game Engines to Analyse UHI Scenarios|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705816332350?|journal=Procedia Engineering|volume=169|pages=272–279|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.proeng.2016.10.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, game scenes become larger than that of old video games ten years ago. Large sandbox or open-world games such as GTA series or Assassin Creeds series need millions of distinguished 3D buildings in their virtual world. Designing these games with instantly testing and editing can reduce workloads and increase the rationality of a game scene in the gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Literary Mapping in the Digital Age|last=Cooper|first=David|publisher=Routledge|date=May 20, 2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Movie Industry ===
''[[Zootopia]],'' which won the 2016 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film]], used CityEngine to establish an impressive metropolis where humans don’t exist. From giraffes to shrews, animals own diverse scales in the system of transportation, houses, and amenities. To build up a multi-scaling city, the designers used CityEngine due to its rule-based system. Before Zootopia (also known as Zootroplis in countries outside the USA), CityEngine was also used to create [https://gizmodo.com/a-tour-of-san-fransokyo-the-hybrid-city-disney-built-f-1642066794 the Japanese-style city]—San Fransokyo—in ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]'' .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tracy|first=Cozzens|date=July 10, 2017|title=Esri UC: How CityEngine powered Disney's Zootopia|url=http://gpsworld.com/esri-uc-how-cityengine-powered-disneys-zootopia/|journal=GPS World|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Computer: A History of the Information Machine''''' is a [[history of computing]] written by [[Martin Campbell-Kelly]] and [[William Aspray]] first published in 1996.  It follows the history of "information machines" from [[Charles Babbage]]'s [[difference engine]] through [[Herman Hollerith]]'s [[tabulating machine]]s to the invention of the modern electronic digital computer.   A revised 2nd edition published in 2004 included new material on the [[Internet]] and [[World Wide Web]], while the updated 3rd edition published in 2013 includes contributions from historians Nathan Ensmenger and Jeffrey Yost.  The 3rd edition extends the story to include recent phenomena such as [[social networking]] and revises the discussion of early history to reflect new insights from the literature.

==Quotes==
:During the second half of the 1980s, the joys of 'surfing the net,' began to excite the interest of people beyond the professional computer-using communities&amp;nbsp;... However, the existing computer networks were largely in government, higher education and business. They were not a [[free good]] and were not open to hobbyists or private firms that did not have access to a host computer. To fill this gap, a number of firms such as [[CompuServe]], [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], [[GEnie]], and [[AOL|America Online]] sprang up to provide low cost network access&amp;nbsp;... While these networks gave access to [[Internet]] for [[e-mail]] (typically on a pay-per-message basis), they did not give the ordinary citizen access to the full range of the Internet, or to the glories of [[Gopher (protocol)|gopherspace]] or the [[World Wide Web]]. In a country whose Constitution enshrines freedom of information, most of its citizens were effectively locked out of the library of the future. The Internet was no longer a technical issue, but a political one. (1996:298).
The revised second edition ends, somewhat ominously:
:The [[Internet]] is simply too important for its continued existence to be imperiled by an antisocial and lawless minority. (2004:279)

==Reviews==
According to [[Michael Sean Mahoney|Michael Mahoney]]'s 1998 review in ''[[IEEE Annals of the History of Computing]]'', Campbell-Kelly and Aspray's account is "a highly readable, broad-brush picture of the development of computing, or rather of the computer industry, from its beginning to the present" which "sets a new standard for the history of computing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael S. Mahoney]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20080420234733/http://www.princeton.edu/~mike/mck-aspray.htm Review of Martin Campbell-Kelly and William Aspray, Computer: A History of the Information Machine], ''[[IEEE Annals of the History of Computing]]'', 20(2):86–87, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review in ''[[Technology and Culture]]'', Robert Seidel writes that "''Computer'' is a readable and comprehensive history intended to acquaint novices with a growing historical literature as well as to provide an overview of that history from Charles Babbage through [[Bill Gates]]. The authors are well-known contributors to that literature. They have gone beyond it, however, in their interpretation, adding insights that can arise only from a synthetic view of the origins, development, and use of the computer."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Seidel, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/summary/v039/39.4br_campbell-kelly.html Computer: A History of the Information Machine (review)], ''[[Technology and Culture]]'', 39(4):820–821, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8178">'''Darwin Core''' (often abbreviated to '''DwC''') is an extension of [[Dublin Core]] for [[biodiversity informatics]]. It is meant to provide a stable standard reference for sharing information on biological diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wieczorek|first=John|author2=D. Bloom |author3=R. Guralnick |author4=S. Blum |author5=M. Döring |author6=R. De Giovanni |author7=T. Robertson |author8=D. Vieglais |title=Darwin Core: An Evolving Community-developed Biodiversity Data Standard.|journal=[[PLoS ONE]] |year=2012|volume=7|issue=1|pages=e29715|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0029715|pmid=22238640|pmc=3253084}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms described in this standard are a part of a larger set of vocabularies and technical specifications under development and maintained by [[Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG)]] (formerly known as the Taxonomic Databases Working Group (TDWG)).

== Description ==
The Darwin Core is a body of standards. It includes a glossary of terms (in other contexts these might be called properties, elements, fields, columns, attributes, or concepts) intended to facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity by providing reference definitions, examples, and commentaries. The Darwin Core is primarily based on [[taxon|taxa]], their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, and samples, and related information. Included in the standard are documents describing how these terms are managed, how the set of terms can be extended for new purposes, and how the terms can be used. The '''Simple Darwin Core''' &lt;ref name="simpledwc"&gt;[http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/simple/index.htm  The Simple Darwin Core]&lt;/ref&gt; is a specification for one particular way to use the terms and to share data about taxa and their occurrences in a simply-structured way. It is likely what is meant if someone were to suggest "formatting your data according to the Darwin Core".

Each '''term''' has a definition and commentaries that are meant to promote the consistent use of the terms across applications and disciplines. Evolving commentaries that discuss, refine, expand, or translate the definitions and examples are referred to through links in the Comments attribute of each term. This approach to documentation allows the standard to adapt to new purposes without disrupting existing applications. There is meant to be a clear separation between the terms defined in the standard and the applications that make use of them. For example, though the data types and constraints are not provided in the term definitions, recommendations are made about how to restrict the values where appropriate.

In practice, Darwin Core decouples the definition and semantics of individual terms from application of these terms in different technologies such as [[XML]], [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] or simple [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] text files. Darwin Core provides separate guidelines on how to encode the terms as XML&lt;ref name="dwc-xml" &gt;[http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/xml/index.htm Darwin Core XML Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; or text files.&lt;ref name="dwc-text"&gt;[http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/text/index.htm Darwin Core Text Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Darwin Core was originally created as a [[Z39.50]] profile by the Z39.50 Biology Implementers Group (ZBIG), supported by funding from a USA National Science Foundation award.&lt;ref name="zbig"&gt;An Experimental Z39.50 Information Retrieval Protocol Test Bed for Biological Collection and Taxonomic Data, #9811443 [http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=9811443]&lt;/ref&gt;  The name "Darwin Core" was first coined by Allen Allison at the first meeting of the ZBIG held at the University of Kansas in 1998 while commenting on the profile's conceptual similarity with Dublin Core. The Darwin Core profile was later expressed as an XML Schema document for use by the Distributed Generic Information Retrieval (DiGIR) protocol. A [[TDWG]] task group was created to revise the Darwin Core, and a ratified metadata standard was officially released on 9 October 2009.

Though ratified as a TDWG/[[Biodiversity Information Standards]] standard since then, Darwin Core has had numerous previous versions in production usage. The published standard contains a history&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/history/index.htm Darwin Core History]&lt;/ref&gt; with details of the versions leading to the current standard.

'''Gordon John Garradd''' (born 1959) is an [[Australia]]n amateur [[astronomer]] and photographer from Loomberah, [[New South Wales]]. He has discovered numerous [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s, including the hyperbolic comet C/2009 P1,&lt;ref name="transientsky" /&gt; and four [[nova]]e in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]. The asteroid and [[Mars-crosser]], [[5066 Garradd]], was named in his honor.&lt;ref name="springer-Garradd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt;

[[File:Comet-Garradd-Aug-2011.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|alt=Comet Garradd|Comet [[C/2009 P1]] Garradd&lt;ref name="transientsky" /&gt;]]

He has worked for a number of astronomical institutions in the US and Australia, most recently at [[Siding Spring Observatory]] on the Siding Spring Survey, part of the NASA-funded [[Catalina Sky Survey]] for [[near-Earth object]]s (2002–2011). {{as of|2016}}, the [[Minor Planet Center]] credits him with the discovery of 31 [[minor planets]] ''(see table)''.&lt;ref name="MPC-Discoverers" /&gt; There are 16 comets and an asteroid that bear his name.&lt;ref name="JPL-containing-Garradd" /&gt; His cometary discoveries include [[186P/Garradd]] (comet Garradd 1), a [[Jupiter-family comet]],&lt;ref name="jpldata-G1" /&gt; and [[259P/Garradd]] (comet Garradd 4), an [[Encke-type comet]].&lt;ref name="jpldata-G4" /&gt;

Garradd was born in Australia and lived his early life in Sydney, Canberra, Oberon, and Tamworth. Astronomy has been an interest since his childhood, and he has built many telescopes himself, starting with a 20&amp;nbsp;cm (8") f/7 Newtonian while still in high school, graduating to making mirrors up to 46&amp;nbsp;cm (18″) diameter and mounts up to the fork mount for the 46&amp;nbsp;cm f/5.4 Newtonian, and German equatorial mounted 25&amp;nbsp;cm (10") f/4.1 that he used for observing near-Earth asteroids and comets.&lt;ref name="Deseret News" /&gt;

His initial profession was as an accountant, but he left that in 1984 to pursue astronomy and photography full-time.&lt;ref name="Australian-astronomy" /&gt; He lives with his wife Hether, off the power grid, using solar and wind power. He is a photographer, mountain bike rider, and solar- and wind-power enthusiast.&lt;ref name="Deseret News" /&gt;

The '''Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope''' ('''HUT''') was a space telescope designed to make [[spectroscopic]] observations in the [[far-ultraviolet]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. It was flown into orbit on the [[Space Shuttle]] and operated from the Shuttle's payload bay on two occasions: in December 1990, as part of Shuttle mission [[STS-35]], and in March 1995, as part of mission [[STS-67]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is HUT and what does it do? |url=http://praxis.pha.jhu.edu/instruments/what_is_hut2.html |author=Bill Blair |accessdate=2009-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207180653/http://praxis.pha.jhu.edu/instruments/what_is_hut2.html |archivedate=2009-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HUT was designed and built by a team based at [[Johns Hopkins University]], led by [[Arthur Davidsen]].&lt;ref name='hut tech'&gt;{{cite web|title=HUT Technical Summary |url=http://praxis.pha.jhu.edu/instruments/hut_info2.html |author=Bill Blair |accessdate=2009-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703234433/http://praxis.pha.jhu.edu/instruments/hut_info2.html |archivedate=2008-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Arthur Davidsen, 57, Johns Hopkins Astrophysicist, Dies | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E4DB133AF931A15754C0A9679C8B63 | author = Dennis Overbye | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = 2001-07-22 | accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telescope consisted of a 90&amp;nbsp;cm main mirror used to focus ultraviolet light onto a spectrograph situated at the [[prime focus]]. This instrument had a spectroscopic range of 82.5 to 185 [[nanometer|nm]]s, and a spectral resolution of about 0.3&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name='hut tech' /&gt;
It weighed 789 kilograms (1736 pounds).&lt;ref name='hut tech' /&gt;

HUT was used to observe a wide range of astrophysical sources, including [[supernova remnants]], [[active galactic nuclei]], [[cataclysmic variable]] stars, as well as various planets in the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Achievements of ASTRO-2 |url=http://praxis.pha.jhu.edu/astro2/astro2_achieve.html |author=Bill Blair |date=1995-10-16 |accessdate=2009-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915182214/http://praxis.pha.jhu.edu/astro2/astro2_achieve.html |archivedate=2009-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990 flight, HUT was used to make 106 observations of 77 astronomical targets. During the 1995 flight, 385 observations were made of 265 targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope - VizieR On-line Data Catalog | bibcode = 2001yCat.6103....0H | date = June 2001 | accessdate = 2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HUT was co-mounted with WUPPE, HIT, and [[Broad Band X-ray Telescope|BBXRT]] on the [[STS-35|Astro-1 mission]] (1990) and with just WUPPE and HIT on [[STS-67|Astro-2]] (in 1995).&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.stsci.edu/uit/project/ Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Innovation''' can be simply defined as a "new idea, creative thoughts, new imaginations in form of device or method".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/innovation |title= Innovation  |publisher= Merriam-Webster |website= Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate= 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better [[problem solving | solutions]] that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing[[market (economics) | market]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maranville, S.|title=Entrepreneurship in the Business Curriculum|journal=Journal of Education for Business|volume=68|pages=27–31|doi=10.1080/08832323.1992.10117582|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such innovation takes place through the provision of more-effective [[product (business)|product]]s, [[Procedure (term)|processes]], [[Service (economics)|service]]s, [[technologies]], or [[business model]]s that are made available to [[Market (economics)|market]]s, [[government]]s and [[society]]. The term "innovation" can be defined{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that "breaks into" the market or society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.hitech.2009.02.002|title=Questioning two myths in innovation literature|journal=The Journal of High Technology Management Research|volume=20|pages=40–51|year=2009|last1=Frankelius|first1=Per}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and [[Founder CEO|founders]] in [[startups]], rather than existing organizations. Innovation is related to, but not the same as, [[invention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-the-difference-between-invention-and-innovation-2012-4 | title = This Is The Difference Between 'Invention' And 'Innovation' | first = Kim | last = Bhasin | date = 2012-04-02 | work = Business Insider }}&lt;/ref&gt; as innovation is more apt to involve the practical implementation of an invention (i.e. new/improved ability) to make a meaningful impact in the market or society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/09/10/whats-the-difference-between-invention-and-innovation/ | title=What's the Difference Between Invention and Innovation?|publisher=Forbes|date=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not all innovations require an invention. Innovation often{{quantify|date=April 2018}} manifests itself via the [[engineering]] process, when the problem being solved is of a technical or scientific nature. The opposite of innovation is [[exnovation]].

Pronunciation of the word has long been argued about due to the unusual sounding of the o becoming an i. The phonetic sound would suggest a spelling of inivative if taken at the word of a true scholar. 

While a novel device is often described{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} as an innovation, in economics, [[management science]], and other fields of practice and analysis, innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in such a way that they affect society. In [[industrial economics]], innovations are created and found{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} empirically from services to meet growing [[consumer]] [[demand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/general/34749412.pdf Growth in Services].

==Definition==
A 2014 survey of literature on innovation found over 40 definitions. In an industrial survey of how the [[software industry]] defined innovation, the following definition given by Crossan and Apaydin was considered to be the most complete, which  builds on the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)]] manual's definition:&lt;ref name="Henry2014"&gt;Edison, H.,  Ali, N.B., &amp; Torkar, R. (2014). [http://www.torkar.se/resources/jss-edisonNT13.pdf Towards innovation measurement in the software industry]. ''Journal of Systems and Software'' 86(5), 1390–407.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Innovation is production or adoption, assimilation, and exploitation of a value-added novelty in economic and social spheres; renewal and enlargement of products, services, and markets; development of new methods of production; and the establishment of new management systems. It is both a process and an outcome.}}

According to Kanter innovation includes original invention and creative use and defines innovation as a generation, admission and realization of new ideas, products, services and processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Innovation in American Government: Challenges, Opportunities, and Dilemmas|last=|first=|publisher=Brookings Inst Pr|isbn=9780815703587|location=|pages=|date=1997-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main dimensions of innovation were degree of [[novelty (patent)]] (i.e. whether an innovation is new to the firm, new to the market, new to the industry, or new to the world) and kind of innovation (i.e. whether it is processor [[product-service system]] innovation).&lt;ref name="Henry2014" /&gt; In recent organizational scholarship, researchers of workplaces have also distinguished innovation to be separate from creativity, by providing an updated definition of these two related but distinct constructs:{{quote|Workplace creativity concerns the cognitive and behavioral processes applied when attempting to generate novel ideas. Workplace innovation concerns the processes applied when attempting to implement new ideas. Specifically, innovation involves some combination of problem/opportunity identification, the introduction, adoption or modification of new ideas germane to organizational needs, the promotion of these ideas, and the practical implementation of these ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=D.

==Inter-disciplinary views==

===Business and economics===
{{main|innovation economics}}
In [[commerce|business]] and in [[economics]], innovation can become a catalyst for growth. With rapid advancements in [[transportation]] and [[communications]] over the past few decades, the old-world concepts of [[factor endowment]]s and [[comparative advantage]] which focused on an area's unique inputs are outmoded for today's [[globalization|global economy]]. Economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883–1950), who contributed greatly to the study of [[innovation economics]], argued that industries must incessantly revolutionize the economic structure from within, that is innovate with better or more effective processes and products, as well as market distribution, such as the connection from the craft shop to factory. He famously asserted that "[[creative destruction]] is the essential fact about [[capitalism]]".&lt;ref name=capsocdem&gt;{{cite book | author = Schumpeter, J. A. | authorlink = Joseph Schumpeter | year = 1943 | title = Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy | publisher = Routledge | edition = 6 | pages = 81–84 | isbn = 978-0-415-10762-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Entrepreneur]]s continuously look for better ways to satisfy their [[consumer demand|consumer base]] with improved quality, durability, service and price which come to fruition in innovation with advanced technologies and organizational strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Heyne, P., Boettke, P. J., and Prychitko, D. L. (2010). ''The Economic Way of Thinking''. Prentice Hall, 12th ed. pp. 163, 317–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A prime example of innovation involved the explosive boom of [[Silicon Valley]] startups out of the [[Stanford Industrial Park]]. In 1957, dissatisfied employees of [[Shockley Semiconductor]], the company of [[Nobel laureate]] and co-inventor of the [[transistor]] [[William Shockley]], left to form an independent firm, [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]. After several years, Fairchild developed into a formidable presence in the sector. Eventually, these founders left to start their own companies based on their own, unique, latest ideas, and then leading employees started their own firms. Over the next 20 years, this snowball process launched the momentous [[startup company|startup-company]] explosion of [[information technology|information-technology]] firms. Essentially, Silicon Valley began as 65 new enterprises born out of Shockley's eight former employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url= http://www.netvalley.com/svhistory.html |title= Silicon Valley History &amp; Future |website= Netvalley.com |date= |accessdate= 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, hubs of innovation have sprung up globally with similar [[metonym]]s, including [[Silicon Alley]] encompassing [[New York City]].

Another example involves [[business incubator]]s – a phenomenon nurtured by governments around the world, close to knowledge clusters (mostly research-based) like universities or other [[Government Excellence Centre]]s – which aim primarily to channel generated knowledge to applied innovation outcomes in order to stimulate regional or national [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizations===
In the organizational context, innovation may be linked to positive changes in [[efficiency]], [[productivity]], [[Quality (business)|quality]], [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]], and [[market share]]. However, recent research findings highlight the complementary role of organizational culture in enabling organizations to translate innovative activity into tangible performance improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02529.x|title=Benefiting from Public Sector Innovation: The Moderating Role of Customer and Learning Orientation|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=72|issue=4|pages=550–559|year=2012|last1=Salge|first1=Torsten Oliver|last2=Vera|first2=Antonio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations can also improve profits and performance by providing work groups opportunities and resources to innovate, in addition to employee's core job tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1464-0597.00951|title=Sparkling Fountains or Stagnant Ponds: An Integrative Model of Creativity and Innovation Implementation in Work Groups|journal=Applied Psychology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=355–387|year=2002|last1=West|first1=Michael A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Drucker]] wrote:
{{quote|Innovation is the specific function of entrepreneurship, whether in an existing business, a public service institution, or a new venture started by a lone individual in the family kitchen. It is the means by which the entrepreneur either creates new wealth-producing resources or endows existing resources with enhanced potential for creating wealth. –Drucker&lt;ref name="Drucker"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Discipline of Innovation |work=[[Harvard Business Review]] |url= http://hbr.org/2002/08/the-discipline-of-innovation/ar/1 |date=August 2002 |access-date=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Clayton Christensen, [[disruptive innovation]] is the key to future success in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Christensen, Clayton &amp; Overdorf, Michael|year=2000|title=Meeting the Challenge of Disruptive Change|url=https://hbr.org/2000/03/meeting-the-challenge-of-disruptive-change|journal=Harvard Business Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage. It is necessary to create and nurture an environment of innovation. Executives and managers need to break away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage. It is a time of risk but even greater opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;''MIT Sloan Management Review'' Spring 2002. "How to identify and build New Businesses"&lt;/ref&gt; The world of work is changing with the increase in the use of technology and both companies and businesses are becoming increasingly competitive. Companies will have to downsize and re-engineer their operations to remain competitive. This will affect employment as businesses will be forced to reduce the number of people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Scott D.; Johnson, Mark W.; Sinfield, Joseph V.; Altman, Elizabeth J. (2008). ''Innovator's Guide to Growth''. "Putting Disruptive Innovation to Work". Harvard Business School Press. {{ISBN|978-1-59139-846-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While disruptive innovation will typically "attack a traditional business model with a lower-cost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly,"&lt;ref name=hbr201701/&gt; foundational innovation is slower, and typically has the potential to create new foundations for global technology systems over the longer term. Foundational innovation tends to transform business [[operating model]]s as entirely new business models [[emergence|emerge]] over many years, with gradual and steady adoption of the innovation leading to waves of [[technological change|technological]] and [[institution]]al change that gain momentum more slowly.&lt;ref name=hbr201701&gt;

All organizations can innovate, including for example hospitals, universities, and local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19104264|year=2009|last1=Salge|first1=T. O.|title=Hospital innovativeness and organizational performance: Evidence from English public acute care|journal=Health Care Management Review|volume=34|issue=1|pages=54–67|last2=Vera|first2=A.|doi=10.1097/01.HMR.0000342978.84307.80}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, former Mayor [[Martin O’Malley]] pushed the [[City of Baltimore]] to use [[CitiStat]], a [[Performance measurement|performance-measurement]] data and management system that allows city officials to maintain statistics on several areas from crime trends to the conditions of [[pothole]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. This system aids in better evaluation of policies and procedures with accountability and efficiency in terms of time and money. In its first year, CitiStat saved the city $13.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, T. and Rushing R. (2007). [https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/general/reports/2007/04/23/2911/the-citistat-model-how-data-driven-government-can-increase-efficiency-and-effectiveness/ "The CitiStat Model: How Data-Driven Government Can Increase Efficiency and Effectiveness"]. ''Center for American Progress Report''. pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[mass transit]] systems have innovated with [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] bus fleets to [[Real-time locating system|real-time tracking]] at bus stands. In addition, the growing use of [[mobile data terminal]]s in vehicles, that serve as communication hubs between vehicles and a control center, automatically send data on location, passenger counts, engine performance, mileage and other information. This tool helps to deliver and manage transportation systems.&lt;ref&gt;Transportation Research Board (2007). "Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Synthesis 70: Mobile Data Terminals". pp. 1–5. [http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_syn_70.pdf TCRP (PDF)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other innovative strategies include [[hospital]]s digitizing medical information in [[electronic medical records]]. For example, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]]'s [[HOPE VI]] initiatives turned severely distressed [[public housing]] in urban areas into [[Urban renewal|revitalized]], mixed-income environments; the [[Harlem Children’s Zone]] used a community-based approach to educate local area children; and the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Brownfield regulation and development|brownfield grants]] facilitates turning over [[brownfield]]s for [[environmental protection]], [[Open space reserve|green spaces]], [[Community development|community]] and [[Commerce|commercial development]].

===Sources ===
There are several sources of innovation. It can occur as a result of a focus effort by a range of different agents, by chance, or as a result of a major system failure.

According to [[Peter F. Drucker]], the general sources of innovations are different changes in industry structure, in market structure, in local and global demographics, in human perception, mood and meaning, in the amount of already available scientific knowledge, etc.&lt;ref name=Drucker/&gt;

[[File:Technological Change.jpg|thumb|Original model of three phases of the process of Technological Change]]
In the simplest [[linear model of innovation]] the traditionally recognized source is ''manufacturer innovation''. This is where an agent (person or business) innovates in order to sell the innovation. Specifically, R&amp;D measurement is the commonly used input for innovation, in particular in the business sector, named Business Expenditure on R&amp;D (BERD) that grew over the years on the expenses of the declining R&amp;D invested by the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H. Rubin|first=Tzameret|year=2015|title=The Achilles heel of a strong private knowledge sector: evidence from Israel|url=http://nimbusvault.net/publications/koala/inimpact/papers/inkt14-011.pdf|journal=The Journal of Innovation Impact|volume=7 |issue=1|pages=80–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source of innovation, only now becoming widely recognized, is ''end-user innovation''. This is where an agent (person or company) develops an innovation for their own (personal or in-house) use because existing products do not meet their needs. [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] economist [[Eric von Hippel]] has identified end-user innovation as, by far, the most important and critical in his classic book on the subject, ''The Sources of Innovation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/books/sources/SofI.pdf |title=The Sources of Innovation |last=Von Hippel |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric von Hippel |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1988 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012160410/http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/books/sources/SofI.pdf |archivedate=12 October 2006 |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The robotics engineer [[Joseph F. Engelberger]] asserts that innovations require only three things:
# A recognized need,
# Competent people with relevant technology, and
# Financial support.&lt;ref&gt;Engelberger, J. F. (1982). "Robotics in practice: Future capabilities". ''Electronic Servicing &amp; Technology'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, innovation processes usually involve: identifying customer needs, macro and meso trends, developing competences, and finding financial support.

The Kline [[chain-linked model]] of innovation&lt;ref&gt;Kline (1985). ''Research, Invention, Innovation and Production: Models and Reality, Report INN-1'', March 1985, Mechanical Engineering Department, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; places emphasis on potential market needs as drivers of the innovation process, and describes the complex and often iterative feedback loops between marketing, design, manufacturing, and R&amp;D.

Innovation by businesses is achieved in many ways, with much attention now given to formal [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) for "breakthrough innovations". R&amp;D help spur on patents and other scientific innovations that leads to productive growth in such areas as industry, medicine, engineering, and government.&lt;ref name="MetroPolicy"&gt;Mark, M., Katz, B., Rahman, S., and Warren, D. (2008) [https://www.brookings.edu/research/metropolicy-shaping-a-new-federal-partnership-for-a-metropolitan-nation/ ''MetroPolicy: Shaping A New Federal Partnership for a Metropolitan Nation'']. Brookings Institution: Metropolitan Policy Program Report. pp. 4–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, innovations can be developed by less formal on-the-job modifications of practice, through exchange and combination of professional experience and by many other routes. Investigation of relationship between the concepts of innovation and technology transfer revealed overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286542154 |title=Perspectives on Innovation and Technology Transfer |last=Dubickis, M. |first=Gaile-Sarkane, E. |publisher=[[ScienceDirect]] |year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more radical and revolutionary innovations tend to emerge from R&amp;D, while more incremental innovations may emerge from practice – but there are many exceptions to each of these trends.

[[Information technology]] and changing business processes and management style can produce a work climate favorable to innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq |publisher=Forbes India Magazine |title= New Trends in Innovation Management |website=Forbesindia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the software tool company [[Atlassian]] conducts quarterly "ShipIt Days" in which employees may work on anything related to the company's products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.atlassian.com/company/about/shipit |title=ShipIt Days |publisher=Atlassian |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Google employees work on self-directed projects for 20% of their time (known as [[Innovation Time Off]]). Both companies cite these bottom-up processes as major sources for new products and features.

An important innovation factor includes customers buying products or using services. As a result, firms may incorporate users in [[focus group]]s (user centred approach), work closely with so called [[lead users]] (lead user approach) or users might adapt their products themselves. The lead user method focuses on idea generation based on leading users to develop breakthrough innovations. U-STIR, a project to innovate [[Europe]]’s surface [[transportation]] system, employs such workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.u-stir.eu/index.phtml?id=2537&amp;ID1=2537&amp;sprache=en |title=U-STIR |publisher=U-stir.eu |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918055455/http://www.u-stir.eu/index.phtml?id=2537&amp;ID1=2537&amp;sprache=en |archivedate=18 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this [[user innovation]], a great deal of innovation is done by those actually implementing and using technologies and products as part of their normal activities. Sometimes user-innovators may become [[entrepreneur]]s, selling their product, they may choose to trade their innovation in exchange for other innovations, or they may be adopted by their suppliers. Nowadays, they may also choose to freely reveal their innovations, using methods like [[open source]].

One technique for innovating a solution to an identified problem is to actually attempt an experiment with many possible solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/the-mission/forget-about-the-10-000-hour-rule-7b7a39343523 Forget The 10,000-Hour Rule; Edison, Bezos, &amp; Zuckerberg Follow The 10,000-Experiment Rule]. Medium.com (2017-10-26). Retrieved on 2018-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was famously used by Thomas Edison's laboratory to find a version of the [[incandescent light bulb]] economically viable for home use, which involved searching through thousands of possible [[electrical filament|filament]] designs before settling on carbonized bamboo.

This technique is sometimes used in pharmaceutical [[drug discovery]]. Thousands of chemical compounds are subjected to [[high-throughput screening]] to see if they have any activity against a target molecule which has been identified as biologically significant to a disease. Promising compounds can then be studied; modified to improve efficacy, reduce side effects, and reduce cost of manufacture; and if successful turned into treatments.

The related technique of [[A/B testing]] is often used to help optimize the design of [[web site]]s and [[mobile app]]s.  This is used by major sites such as [[amazon.com]], [[Facebook]], [[Google]], and [[Netflix]].&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;[https://www.fastcompany.com/3063846/why-these-tech-companies-keep-running-thousands-of-failed Why These Tech Companies Keep Running Thousands Of Failed Experiments].

===Goals and failures===
Programs of organizational innovation are typically tightly linked to organizational goals and objectives, to the [[business plan]], and to [[Market (economics)|market]] [[Competition (companies)|competitive positioning]]. One driver for innovation programs in corporations is to achieve growth objectives. As Davila et al. (2006) notes, "Companies cannot grow through cost reduction and reengineering alone... Innovation is the key element in providing aggressive top-line growth, and for increasing bottom-line results".&lt;ref name="Making Innovation Work"&gt;Davila, T., Epstein, M. J., and Shelton, R. (2006). "Making Innovation Work: How to Manage It, Measure It, and Profit from It." Upper Saddle River: Wharton School Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

One survey across a large number of manufacturing and services organizations found, ranked in decreasing order of popularity, that systematic programs of organizational innovation are most frequently driven by: improved [[quality (business)|quality]], creation of new [[Market (economics)|market]]s, extension of the [[product (business)|product]] range, reduced [[labor cost]]s, improved [[production process]]es, reduced materials, reduced [[environmental damage]], replacement of [[product (business)|product]]s/[[Service (economics)|services]], reduced [[energy]] consumption, conformance to [[regulation]]s.&lt;ref name="Making Innovation Work"/&gt;

These goals vary between improvements to products, processes and services and dispel a popular myth that innovation deals mainly with new product development. Most of the goals could apply to any organisation be it a manufacturing facility, marketing firm, hospital or local government. Whether innovation goals are successfully achieved or otherwise depends greatly on the environment prevailing in the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1287/mnsc.35.5.597|title=Innovative and Noninnovative Small Firms: Types and Characteristics|journal=Management Science|volume=35|issue=5|pages=597–606|year=1989|last1=Khan|first1=Arshad M.|last2=Manopichetwattana|first2=V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, failure can develop in programs of innovations. The causes of failure have been widely researched and can vary considerably. Some causes will be external to the organization and outside its influence of control. Others will be internal and ultimately within the control of the organization. Internal causes of failure can be divided into causes associated with the cultural infrastructure and causes associated with the innovation process itself. Common causes of failure within the innovation process in most organizations can be distilled into five types: poor goal definition, poor alignment of actions to goals, poor participation in teams, poor monitoring of results, poor communication and access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Sullivan, David |year=2002|title=Framework for Managing Development in the Networked Organisations|journal=Journal of Computers in Industry|volume= 47|issue=1|pages=77–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diffusion==
[[File:InnovationLifeCycle.jpg|thumb|right]]
{{main|Diffusion of innovations}}

Diffusion of innovation research was first started in 1903 by seminal researcher [[Gabriel Tarde]], who first plotted the S-shaped [[diffusion curve]]. Tarde defined the innovation-decision process as a series of steps that includes:&lt;ref&gt;Tarde, G.  (1903). ''The laws of imitation'' (E. Clews Parsons, Trans.). New York: H. Holt &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
# First knowledge
# Forming an attitude
# A decision to adopt or reject
# Implementation and use
# Confirmation of the decision

Once innovation occurs, innovations may be spread from the innovator to other individuals and groups. This process has been proposed that the life cycle of innovations can be described using the '[[Sigmoid function|s-curve]]' or [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion curve]]. The s-curve maps growth of revenue or productivity against time. In the early stage of a particular innovation, growth is relatively slow as the new product establishes itself. At some point, customers begin to demand and the product growth increases more rapidly. New incremental innovations or changes to the product allow growth to continue. Towards the end of its lifecycle, growth slows and may even begin to decline. In the later stages, no amount of new investment in that product will yield a normal rate of return

The s-curve derives from an assumption that new products are likely to have "product life" – i.e., a start-up phase, a rapid increase in revenue and eventual decline. In fact, the great majority of innovations never get off the bottom of the curve, and never produce normal returns.

Innovative companies will typically be working on new innovations that will eventually replace older ones. Successive s-curves will come along to replace older ones and continue to drive growth upwards. In the figure above the first curve shows a current technology. The second shows an [[emerging technologies|emerging technology]] that currently yields lower growth but will eventually overtake current technology and lead to even greater levels of growth. The length of life will depend on many factors.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E. M. (1962). ''Diffusion of Innovation''. New York, NY: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==
Measuring innovation is inherently difficult as it implies commensurability so that comparisons can be made in quantitative terms. Innovation, however, is by definition novelty. Comparisons are thus often meaningless across products or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford handbook of innovation|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Fagerberg, Jan., Mowery, David C., Nelson, Richard R.|isbn=9780199264551|location=Oxford|oclc=56655392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Edison et al.&lt;ref name="Henry2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Edison, H.,  Ali, N.B., &amp; Torkar, R.|doi=10.1016/j.jss.2013.01.013|url=http://www.torkar.se/resources/jss-edisonNT13.pdf |title=Towards innovation measurement in the software industry|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|volume=86|issue=5|pages=1390–1407|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in their review of literature on [[innovation management]] found 232 innovation metrics. They categorized these measures along five dimensions i.e. inputs to the innovation process, output from the innovation process, effect of the innovation output, measures to access the activities in an innovation process and availability of factors that facilitate such a process.&lt;ref name="Henry2013" /&gt;

There are two different types of measures for innovation: the organizational level and the political level.

===Organizational level===
The measure of innovation at the organizational level relates to individuals, team-level assessments, and private companies from the smallest to the largest company. Measure of innovation for organizations can be conducted by surveys, workshops, consultants, or internal benchmarking. There is today no established general way to measure organizational innovation. Corporate measurements are generally structured around [[balanced scorecard]]s which cover several aspects of innovation such as business measures related to finances, innovation process efficiency, employees' contribution and motivation, as well benefits for customers. Measured values will vary widely between businesses, covering for example new product revenue, spending in R&amp;D, time to market, customer and employee perception &amp; satisfaction, number of patents, additional sales resulting from past innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Davila, Tony; Marc J. Epstein and Robert Shelton (2006). ''Making Innovation Work: How to Manage It, Measure It, and Profit from It''. Upper Saddle River: Wharton School Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political level===
For the political level, measures of innovation are more focused on a country or region [[competitive advantage]] through innovation. In this context, organizational capabilities can be evaluated through various evaluation frameworks, such as those of the European Foundation for Quality Management. The [[OECD]] Oslo Manual (1995) suggests standard guidelines on measuring technological product and process innovation. Some people consider the [[Oslo Manual]] complementary to the [[Frascati Manual]] from 1963. The new Oslo manual from 2005 takes a wider perspective to innovation, and includes marketing and organizational innovation. These standards are used for example in the European [[Community Innovation Survey]]s.&lt;ref&gt;OECD The Measurement of Scientific and Technological Activities. Proposed Guidelines for Collecting and Interpreting Technological Innovation Data. Oslo Manual. 2nd edition, DSTI, OECD / European Commission Eurostat, Paris 31 December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ways of measuring innovation have traditionally been expenditure, for example, investment in R&amp;D (Research and Development) as percentage of GNP (Gross National Product). Whether this is a good measurement of innovation has been widely discussed and the Oslo Manual has incorporated some of the critique against earlier methods of measuring. The traditional methods of measuring still inform many policy decisions. The EU [[Lisbon Strategy]] has set as a goal that their average expenditure on R&amp;D should be 3% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/ |title=Industrial innovation – Enterprise and Industry |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827125633/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/ |archivedate=27 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Level Down of Innovation in Silicon Valley ===
Innovation is starting to decline due to the newly introduced immigration policies. The new immigration policies have effects on the economy because 25% of the companies were created by foreign entrepreneurs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/08/30/why-startups-are-leaving-silicon-valley|title=Why startups are leaving Silicon Valley|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indicators===
Many scholars claim that there is a great bias towards the "science and technology mode" (S&amp;T-mode or STI-mode), while the "learning by doing, using and interacting mode" (DUI-mode) is ignored and measurements and research about it rarely done. For example, an institution may be high tech with the latest equipment, but lacks crucial doing, using and interacting tasks important for innovation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

A common industry view (unsupported by empirical evidence) is that comparative [[cost-effectiveness]] research is a form of [[price controls|price control]] which reduces returns to industry, and thus limits R&amp;D expenditure, stifles future innovation and compromises new products access to markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19523121|pmc=2881450|year=2009|last1=Chalkidou|first1=K.|title=Comparative effectiveness research and evidence-based health policy: Experience from four countries|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=87|issue=2|pages=339–67|last2=Tunis|first2=S.|last3=Lopert|first3=R.|last4=Rochaix|first4=L.|last5=Sawicki|first5=P. T.|last6=Nasser|first6=M.|last7=Xerri|first7=B.|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00560.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some academics claim cost-effectiveness research is a valuable value-based measure of innovation which accords "truly significant" therapeutic advances (i.e. providing "health gain") higher prices than free market mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roughead |first=E. |last2=Lopert |first2=R. |last3=Sansom |first3=L. |title=Prices for innovative pharmaceutical products that provide health gain: a comparison between Australia and the United States Value |journal=[[Health (journal)|Health]] |year=2007 |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=514–20 |doi=10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00206.x |pmid=17970935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[value-based pricing]] has been viewed as a means of indicating to industry the type of innovation that should be rewarded from the public purse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=B. |title=Payers Growing Influence on R&amp;D Decision Making |journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery |year=2008 |volume=7 |issue= 11|pages=876–78 |doi=10.1038/nrd2749 |pmid=18974741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Australian]] academic developed the case that national comparative [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] systems should be viewed as measuring "health innovation" as an [[evidence-based policy]] concept for valuing innovation distinct from valuing through competitive markets, a method which requires strong [[anti-trust]] laws to be effective, on the basis that both methods of assessing [[pharmaceutical innovations]] are mentioned in annex 2C.1 of the [[AUSFTA|Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faunce |first=T. |last2=Bai |first2=J. |last3=Nguyen |first3=D. |title=Impact of the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement on Australian medicines regulation and prices |journal=[[Journal of Generic Medicines]] |year=2010 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=18–29 |doi=10.1057/jgm.2009.40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Faunce TA|title=Global intellectual property protection of 'innovative' pharmaceuticals: Challenges for bioethics and health law in B Bennett and G Tomossy|publisher=Globalization and Health Springer|date=2006|url=http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Ch%20Globalisation%20and%20Health%20Fau.pdf|format=PDF|website=Law.anu.edu.au|accessdate=18 June 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414040804/http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Ch%20Globalisation%20and%20Health%20Fau.pdf|archivedate=14 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faunce |first=T.

===Rankings===
Many research studies try to rank countries based on measures of innovation. Common areas of focus include: [[high-tech]] companies, [[manufacturing]], [[patent]]s, [[post secondary education]], [[research and development]],  and research personnel. The left ranking of the top 10 countries below is based on the 2016 [[Bloomberg Innovation Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-19/these-are-the-world-s-most-innovative-economies|title=These Are the World's Most Innovative Economies|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies may vary widely; for example the [[Global Innovation Index]] 2016 ranks [[Switzerland]] as number one wherein countries like [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] do not even make the top ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://de.statista.com/infografik/5509/die-10-innovativsten-laender-weltweit-nach-dem-global-innovation-index/|title=Infografik: Schweiz bleibt globaler Innovationsführer|last=|first=|date=|website=Statista Infografiken|publisher=Statista (In German)|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future ===
In 2005 [[Jonathan Huebner]], a [[physicist]] working at the [[Pentagon Building|Pentagon]]'s [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake|Naval Air Warfare Center]], argued on the basis of both U.S. [[patent]]s and world technological breakthroughs, per capita, that the rate of human technological innovation peaked in 1873 and has been slowing ever since.&lt;ref name=Huebner&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huebner | first1 = J. | title = A possible declining trend for worldwide innovation | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2005.01.003 | journal = [[Technological Forecasting and Social Change]] | volume = 72 | issue = 8 | pages = 980–986 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/050707/7inventor.htm|title=Science: Wanna be an inventor? Don't bother| last=Hayden|first=Thomas|date=7 July 2005|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article, he asked "Will the level of technology reach a maximum and then decline as in the Dark Ages?"&lt;ref name=Huebner/&gt; In later comments to ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine, Huebner clarified that while he believed that we will reach a rate of innovation in 2024 equivalent to that of the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], he was not predicting the reoccurrence of the Dark Ages themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adler|first=Robert|title=Entering a dark age of innovation|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7616-entering-a-dark-age-of-innovation.html|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=New Scientist|date=2 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Smart]] criticized the claim and asserted that [[technological singularity]] researcher [[Ray Kurzweil]] and others showed a "clear trend of acceleration, not deceleration" when it came to innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smart | first1 = J. | title = Discussion of Huebner article | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2005.07.001 | journal = [[Technological Forecasting and Social Change]] | volume = 72 | issue = 8 | pages = 988–995 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation replied to Huebner the journal his article was published in, citing [[Second Life]] and [[eHarmony]] as proof of accelerating innovation; to which Huebner replied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huebner|first1=Jonathan|title=Response by the Authors|journal=[[Technological Forecasting and Social Change]]|volume=72|issue=8|pages=995–1000|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2005.05.008|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, Huebner's findings were confirmed in 2010 with [[U.S. Patent Office]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Strumsky | first1 = D. | last2 = Lobo | first2 = J. | last3 = Tainter | first3 = J.

The theme of innovation as a tool to disrupting patterns of poverty has gained momentum since the mid-2000s among major [[international development]] actors such as [[DFID]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dfid.blog.gov.uk/author/jonathan-wong-head-of-dfids-innovation-hub/ |title=Jonathan Wong, Head of DFID's Innovation Hub &amp;#124; DFID bloggers |website=Dfid.blog.gov.uk |date=2014-09-24 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gates Foundation]]'s use of the [[Grand Challenge]] funding model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2014/10/Gates-Foundation-Grand-Challenges-Breakthrough-Science |title=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and Grand Challenge Partners Commit to Innovation with New Investments in Breakthrough Science – Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation |website=Gatesfoundation.org |date=2014-10-07 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[USAID]]'s Global Development Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/GlobalDevLab |title=Global Development Lab &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development |website=Usaid.gov |date=2015-08-05 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Networks have been established to support innovation in development, such as D-Lab at [[MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d-lab.mit.edu/idin |title=International Development Innovation Network (IDIN) &amp;#124; D-Lab |website=D-lab.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investment funds have been established to identify and catalyze innovations in [[developing countries]], such as DFID's Global Innovation Fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/international-development-funding/global-innovation-fund |title=Global Innovation Fund International development funding |website=GOV.UK |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Development Innovation Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hdif-tz.org |title=Human Development Innovation Fund (HDIF) |website=Hdif-tz.org |date=2015-08-14 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (in partnership with USAID) the Global Development Innovation Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/usaid-and-dfid-announce-global-development-innovation-ventures |title=USAID and DFID Announce Global Development Innovation Ventures to Invest in Breakthrough Solutions to World Poverty &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development |website=Usaid.gov |date=2013-06-06 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government policies==
Given the noticeable effects on [[efficiency]], [[quality of life]], and [[productivity|productive growth]], innovation is a key factor in society and economy. Consequently, policymakers have long worked to develop environments that will foster innovation and its resulting positive benefits, from funding [[Research and Development]] to supporting regulatory change, funding the development of innovation clusters, and using public purchasing and standardisation to 'pull' innovation through.

For instance, experts are advocating that the U.S. federal government launch a National Infrastructure Foundation, a nimble, collaborative strategic intervention organization that will house innovations programs from fragmented silos under one entity, inform federal officials on innovation [[performance measurement|performance metrics]], strengthen industry-university partnerships, and support innovation [[economic development]] initiatives, especially to strengthen [[business cluster|regional clusters]]. Because clusters are the geographic incubators of innovative products and processes, a cluster development grant program would also be targeted for implementation. By focusing on innovating in such areas as precision [[manufacturing]], [[information technology]], and [[clean energy]], other areas of national concern would be tackled including [[government debt]], [[carbon footprint]], and [[oil dependence]].&lt;ref name="MetroPolicy"/&gt; The U.S. [[Economic Development Administration]] understand this reality in their continued Regional Innovation Clusters initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eda.gov/PDF/EDA_FY_2010_Annual_Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=U.S. Economic Development Administration : Fiscal Year 2010 Annual Report |website=Eda.gov |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, federal grants in R&amp;D, a crucial driver of innovation and productive growth, should be expanded to levels similar to [[Japan]], [[Finland]], [[South Korea]], and [[Switzerland]] in order to stay globally competitive. Also, such grants should be better procured to [[metropolitan economy|metropolitan areas]], the essential engines of the American economy.&lt;ref name="MetroPolicy"/&gt;

Many countries recognize the importance of research and development as well as innovation including Japan's [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/a06.htm |title=Science and Technology |publisher=MEXT |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905171421/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/a06.htm |archivedate=5 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmbf.de/en/Ministry.php |title=BMBF " Ministry |publisher=Bmbf.de |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Science and Technology]] in the People's Republic of China. Furthermore, Russia's innovation programme is the [[Medvedev modernisation programme]] which aims at creating a diversified economy based on high technology and innovation. Also, the [[Government of Western Australia]] has established a number of innovation incentives for government departments. [[Landgate]] was the first Western Australian government agency to establish its Innovation Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landgate.wa.gov.au/innovation |title=Home  |publisher=Landgate Innovation Program |website=Landgate.wa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regions]] have taken a more proactive role in supporting innovation. Many regional governments are setting up [[regional innovation agency]] to strengthen regional innovation capabilities. In [[Medellin]], [[Colombia]], the municipality of Medellin created in 2009 [[Ruta N]] to transform the city into a knowledge city.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23792949.2018.1538702?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of interface bit rates''', is a measure of [[information rate|information transfer rate]]s, or [[bandwidth (computing)|digital bandwidth capacity]], at which digital interfaces in a [[computer]] or [[networking hardware|network]] can communicate over various kinds of [[computer bus|buses]] and [[channel capacity|channels]]. The distinction can be arbitrary between a ''[[bus (computing)|computer bus]]'', often closer in space, and larger [[telecommunications network]]s. Many device [[interface (computing)|interfaces]] or [[protocols (computing)|protocols]] (e.g., SATA, USB, [[Serial Attached SCSI|SAS]], [[PCI Express|PCIe]]) are used both inside many-device boxes, such as a PC, and one-device-boxes, such as a [[hard drive enclosure]]. Accordingly, this page lists both the internal ribbon and external communications cable standards together in one sortable table.

==Factors limiting actual performance, criteria for real decisions==
Most of the listed rates are theoretical [[maximum throughput]] measures; in practice, the [[measuring network throughput|actual effective throughput]] is almost inevitably lower in proportion to the load from other devices ([[contention (telecommunications)|network]]/[[bus contention]]), physical or temporal distances, and other [[overhead (computing)|overhead]] in [[data link layer]] protocols etc.  The maximum [[goodput]] (for example, the file transfer rate) may be even lower due to higher layer protocol overhead and data packet retransmissions caused by line [[noise]] or [[Interference (communication)|interference]] such as [[crosstalk]], or lost packets in [[Network congestion|congested]] intermediate network nodes.  All protocols lose something, and the more robust ones that deal resiliently with very many failure situations tend to lose more maximum throughput to get higher total long term rates.

Device interfaces where one bus transfers data via another will be limited to the throughput of the slowest interface, at best.  For instance, [[Serial ATA|SATA]] revision 3.0 (6 Gbit/s) controllers on one PCI Express 2.0 (5 Gbit/s) channel will be limited to the 5 Gbit/s rate and have to employ more channels to get around this problem.  Early implementations of new protocols very often have this kind of problem. The physical phenomena on which the device relies (such as spinning platters in a hard drive) will also impose limits; for instance, no spinning platter shipping in 2009 saturates [[Serial ATA|SATA]] revision 2.0 (3&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s), so moving from this 3&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s interface to [[USB 3.0]] at 4.8&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s for one spinning drive will result in no increase in realized transfer rate.

Contention in a wireless or noisy spectrum, where the physical medium is entirely out of the control of those who specify the protocol, requires measures that also use up throughput. Wireless devices, [[Broadband over Power Lines|BPL]], and [[modem]]s may produce a higher [[line rate]] or [[gross bit rate]], due to [[error-correcting code]]s and other [[physical layer]] overhead.  It is extremely common for throughput to be far less than half of theoretical maximum, though the more recent technologies (notably BPL) employ preemptive spectrum analysis to avoid this and so have much more potential to reach actual gigabit rates in practice than prior modems.

Another factor reducing throughput is deliberate policy decisions made by [[Internet service provider]]s that are made for contractual, risk management, aggregation saturation, or marketing reasons.  Examples are [[rate limiting]], [[bandwidth throttling]], and the assignment of [[IP address]]es to groups. These practices tend to minimize the throughput available to every user, but maximize the number of users that can be supported on one backbone.

Furthermore, chips are often not available in order to implement the fastest rates. [[AMD]], for instance, does not support the 32-bit [[HyperTransport]] interface on any CPU it has shipped as of the end of 2009. Additionally, [[WiMAX]] service providers in the US typically support only up to 4&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s as of the end of 2009.

Choosing service providers or interfaces based on theoretical maxima is unwise, especially for commercial needs. A good example is large scale data centers, which should be more concerned with price per port to support the interface, wattage and heat considerations, and total cost of the solution. Because some protocols such as SCSI and Ethernet now operate many orders of magnitude faster than when originally deployed, scalability of the interface is one major factor, as it prevents costly shifts to technologies that are not backward compatible. Underscoring this is the fact that these shifts often happen involuntarily or by surprise, especially when a vendor abandons support for a proprietary system.

==Conventions==
{{Bit and byte prefixes}}
By convention, bus and network data rates are denoted either in bits per second (bit/s) or bytes per second (B/s). In general, [[parallel communications|parallel]] interfaces are quoted in B/s and [[serial communications|serial]] in bit/s. The more commonly used is shown below in '''bold''' type.

On devices like [[modem]]s, bytes may be more than 8 bits long because they may be individually padded out with additional start and stop bits; the figures below will reflect this. Where channels use [[line code]]s (such as [[Ethernet]], [[Serial ATA]] and [[PCI Express]]), quoted rates are for the decoded signal.

The figures below are [[simplex communication|simplex]] data rates, which may conflict with the duplex rates vendors sometimes use in promotional materials. Where two values are listed, the first value is the [[downstream (networking)|downstream]] rate and the second value is the upstream rate.

All quoted figures are in metric [[binary prefixes|decimal units]]. Note that these aren't the traditional binary prefixes for memory size. These decimal prefixes have long been established in data communications. This occurred before 1998 when [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] and other organizations introduced new [[binary prefixes]] and attempted to standardize their use across all computing applications.

==Bandwidths==
The figures below are grouped by network or bus type, then sorted within each group from lowest to highest bandwidth; gray shading indicates a lack of known implementations.

|align=right| '''{{val|0.021|ul=kbit/s}}'''&lt;ref name=morse_bps&gt;Morse can transport 26 alphabetic, 10 numeric and one interword gap plaintext symbols. Transmitting 37 different symbols requires 5.21&amp;nbsp;[[bit]]s of information (2&lt;sup&gt;5.21&lt;/sup&gt;=37). A skilled operator encoding the benchmark "PARIS" plus an interword gap (equal to 31.26&amp;nbsp;bits) at 40&amp;nbsp;wpm is operating at an equivalence of 20.84&amp;nbsp;bit/s.&lt;/ref&gt;
|align=right| {{val|4|ul=characters per second}} ({{val|p=~|ul=wpm|40}})&lt;ref name=morse_wpm&gt;WPM, or Words Per Minute, is the number of times the word "PARIS" is transferred per minute. Strictly speaking the code is quinary, accounting inter-element, inter-letter, and inter-word gaps, yielding 50 binary elements (bits) per one word. Counting characters, including inter-word gaps, gives six characters per word or 240 characters per minute, and finally four characters per second.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, currently modems are wrongly calculated with transmission of 10 bits per 8-bit byte (11 bits for 110-baud modems). Although the serial port is nearly always used to connect a modem and has equivalent data rates, the protocols, modulations and error correction differ completely.&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Wireless network]]s===
[[802.11]] networks in infrastructure mode are half-duplex; all stations share the medium. In infrastructure or access point mode, all traffic has to pass through an [[Wireless access point|Access Point]] (AP). Thus, two stations on the same access point that are communicating with each other must have each and every frame transmitted twice: from the sender to the access point, then from the access point to the receiver. This approximately halves the effective bandwidth.

802.11 networks in ad hoc mode are still half-duplex, but devices communicate directly rather than through an access point. In this mode all devices must be able to "see" each other, instead of only having to be able to "see" the access point.

{{note label|lpc|x|x}} LPC protocol includes high overhead. While the gross data rate equals 33.3 million 4-bit-transfers per second (or {{val|16.67|u=MB/s}}), the fastest transfer, firmware read, results in {{val|15.63|u=MB/s}}. The next fastest bus cycle, 32-bit ISA-style DMA write, yields only {{val|6.67|u=MB/s}}. Other transfers may be as low as {{val|2|u=MB/s}}.&lt;ref name="lpc-spec"&gt;[http://www.intel.com/design/chipsets/industry/lpc.htm Intel LPC Interface Specification 1.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{note label|128b-130b|y|y}} Uses [[128b/130b]] encoding, meaning that about 1.54% of each transfer is used by the interface instead of carrying data between the hardware components at each end of the interface. For example, a single link PCIe 3.0 interface has an 8&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s transfer rate, yet its usable bandwidth is only about 7.88&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s.

{{note label|8b-10b|z|z}} Uses [[8b/10b encoding]], meaning that 20% of each transfer is used by the interface instead of carrying data from between the hardware components at each end of the interface. For example, a single link PCIe 1.0 has a 2.5&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s transfer rate, yet its usable bandwidth is only 2&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s (250&amp;nbsp;MB/s).

===[[Dynamic random-access memory]]===
The table below shows values for [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] memory module types.
These modules usually combine multiple chips on one [[printed circuit board|circuit board]].
SIMM modules connect to the computer via an 8-bit- or 32-bit-wide interface.
DIMM modules connect to the computer via a 64-bit-wide interface.
Some other computer architectures use different modules with a different bus width.

In a single-channel configuration, only one module at a time can transfer information to the CPU.
In multi-channel configurations, multiple modules can transfer information to the CPU at the same time, in parallel.
[[Fast Page Mode DRAM|FPM]], [[Extended Data Out DRAM|EDO]], [[SDRAM#SDR SDRAM|SDR]], and [[RDRAM]] memory was not commonly installed in a dual-channel configuration. [[DDR SDRAM|DDR]] and [[DDR2 SDRAM|DDR2]] memory is usually installed in single- or dual-channel configuration. [[DDR3 SDRAM|DDR3]] memory is installed in single-, dual-, tri-, and quad-channel configurations.
Bit rates of multi-channel configurations are the product of the module bit-rate (given below) and the number of channels.

&lt;!-- Note that the only differences between DDR generations at the same speed are limited to latency changes.

===Graphics processing units' RAM===
RAM memory modules are also utilised by [[graphics processing units]]; however, memory modules for those differ somewhat from standard computer memory, particularly with lower power requirements, and are specialised to serve GPUs: for example, [[GDDR3]] was fundamentally based on [[DDR2 SDRAM|DDR2]]. Every graphics memory chip is directly connected to the GPU (point-to-point). The total GPU memory bus width varies with the number of memory chips and the number of lanes per chip. For example, GDDR5 specifies either 16 or 32 lanes per "device" (chip), while GDDR5X specifies 64 lanes per chip. Over the years, bus widths rose from 64-bit to 512-bit and beyond: e.g. [[High Bandwidth Memory|HBM]] is 1024 bits wide.&lt;ref&gt;[[Comparison of AMD graphics processing units]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of this variability, graphics memory speeds are sometimes compared per pin. For direct comparison to the values for 64-bit modules shown above, video RAM is compared here in 64-lane lots, corresponding to two chips for those devices with 32-bit widths.
In 2012, high-end GPUs used 8 or even 12 chips with 32 lanes each, for a total memory bus width of 256 or 384 bits. Combined with a transfer rate per pin of 5&amp;nbsp;GT/s or more, such cards could reach 240 GB/s or more.

RAM frequencies used for a given chip technology vary greatly. Where single values are given below, they are examples from high-end cards.&lt;ref&gt;[[Comparison of Nvidia graphics processing units]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since many cards have more than one pair of chips, the total bandwidth is correspondingly higher. For example, high-end cards often have eight chips, each 32 bits wide, so the total bandwidth for such cards is four times the value given below.

'''Magnetic water treatment''' (also known as '''anti-scale magnetic treatment''' or '''AMT''') is a method of supposedly reducing the effects of [[hard water]] by passing it through a [[magnetic field]] as a non-chemical alternative to [[water softening]].  Magnetic water treatment is regarded as unproven and unscientific.

There is a lack of peer-reviewed laboratory data, mechanistic explanations, and documented field studies to support its effectiveness.  Erroneous conclusions about their efficacy are based on applications with uncontrolled variables. There are, however, some studies which have claimed significant effects and proposed possible mechanisms for the observed decrease in water scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szkatula |first1=A |last2=Balanda |first2=M |last3=Kopeć |first3=M |year=2002 |title=Magnetic treatment of industrial water.

==Effectiveness==
Vendors of magnetic water treatment devices frequently use pictures and [[Anecdotal evidence|testimonials]] to support their claims, but omit quantitative detail and well-controlled studies.&lt;ref name="Keister2004" /&gt; Advertisements and promotions generally omit system variables, such as corrosion or system mass balance analyticals, as well as measurements of post-treatment water such as concentration of hardness ions or the distribution, structure, and morphology of suspended particles.&lt;ref name="Keister2004"&gt;

Duration of exposure and field strength, gradient, rate of change, and orientation along or perpendicular to flow are variously cited as important to the results.&lt;ref name="Chaplin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/descal.html#212|title=Descaling of Water|last=Chaplin|first=M.|date=26 July 2011|work=Water Structure and Science|publisher=[[London South Bank University]] |accessdate=2012-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527094356/http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/descal.html#212 |archivedate=27 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic water treatment proponent Klaus Kronenberg proposed that the shapes of solute [[Lime (material)|lime]] molecules are modified by strong magnetic fields, leading them to precipitate as spherical or round crystals rather than deposit as sheets or platelets of hard crystals.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simon Parsons of the School of Water Sciences at [[Cranfield University]] proposed that the magnetic field reduces the surface charge on small particles, increasing the tendency to coagulate as large particles that stay with the flow rather than depositing as scale. However, an internal study in 1996 at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] found no difference in preferred crystal structure of scale deposited in magnetic water treatment systems.&lt;ref name="Krauter1996"&gt;

&lt;!-- Note: The 1996 Entrepreneur article mentioned Paul Coetzee, who (based on experiments and observations) "believes that there is no effect directly related to any magnetic (or electric) field."  Coetzee's later study, published in Water SA in 2003, concluded that "It was found that the permanent magnet was effective in suppressing the mass precipitation of scale in all six [of] these experiments", reflecting different results from an experiment conducted under different conditions. --&gt;

[[Constantino Tsallis]] has proposed a '''nonextensive entropy''' ([[Tsallis entropy]]), which is a generalization of the traditional [[Boltzmann's entropy formula|Boltzmann–Gibbs entropy]].

The rationale behind the theory is that Gibbs-Boltzmann entropy leads to systems that have a strong dependence on [[initial conditions]]. In reality most materials behave quite independently of initial conditions.

Nonextensive entropy leads to nonextensive [[statistical mechanics]], whose typical functions are [[power law]]s, instead of the traditional [[Exponential function|exponential]]s.

'''''Organization of Behavior''''' is a 1949 book by the psychologist [[Donald O. Hebb]], in which the author introduces his theory about the [[neuron|neural]] bases of [[learning]], which is now commonly known as "[[Hebbian learning|Hebb's postulate]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heb49|Hebb 1949]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on a secondary source discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
Hebb proposes that whenever conditioned reflexes are established in an organism through learning, a new anatomical substratum is established in the brain through a physiological process in which weak or non-existent [[synapse]]s are strengthened by biochemical modification or by permanent changes in their electrical properties. Learning, according to Hebb's hypothesis, is not simply something impressive upon a passive brain, but a process in which the cellular structure of the brain is permanently modified.&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;[[#Web05|Webster 2005]]. p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Organization of Behavior'' is the most influential outline of Hebb's hypothesis. [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]] comments in ''[[Why Freud Was Wrong]]'' (1995) that the hypothesis has classic status within science and is supported by recent research.&lt;ref name="Webster" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4139">A '''proton conductor''' is an [[electrolyte]], typically a [[solid electrolyte]], in which [[hydron (chemistry)|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;ref&gt;Traditionally, but not precisely, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;ions are referred as "[[proton]]s".&lt;/ref&gt; are the primary charge carriers.

==Composition==
Acid solutions exhibit [[Grotthuss_mechanism|proton-conductivity]], but for practical applications, proton conductors are usually dry solids.  Typical materials are polymers or ceramic.  Typically, the pores in practical materials are small such that [[proton]]s dominate [[electrical conduction|direct current]] and transport of cations or bulk solvent is prevented.  [[Ice|Water ice]] is a common example of a proton conductor, albeit a relatively poor one.&lt;ref&gt;

Solid-phase proton conduction was first suggested by [[Alfred Rene Jean Paul Ubbelohde]] and S. E. Rogers. in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although electrolyte proton currents have been [[Theodor_Grotthuss|recognized since 1806.]]

Proton conduction has also been observed in the new type of proton conductors for fuel cells - protic organic ionic [[plastic crystal]]s (POIPCs), such as 1,2,4-triazolium perfluorobutanesulfonate&lt;ref&gt;

When in the [[Proton exchange membrane|form of thin membrane]]s, proton conductors are an essential part of small, inexpensive [[proton exchange membrane fuel cell|fuel cells]]. The polymer [[nafion]] is a typical proton conductor in fuel cells.  A jelly-like substance similar to nafion residing in the [[ampullae of Lorenzini]] of sharks has proton conductivity only slightly lower than nafion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/05/16/sharks-electricity-sensing-organs-are-even-more-powerful-than-we-realized/&lt;/ref&gt;

High proton conductivity has been reported among alkaline-earth cerates and [[zirconate]] based perovskite materials such as acceptor doped SrCeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, BaCeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and BaZrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Scottish government economy directorates''' were a set of [[:wikt:directorate|directorates]] within the [[Scottish government]], the executive arm of the devolved government of [[Scotland]].  The directorates were headed by Dr [[Andrew Goudie (economist)|Andrew Goudie]], who also acted as the chief economic adviser to the Scottish government (Goudie retired in 2011 and joined [[University of Strathclyde|Strathclyde University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-14268157|title=Andrew Goudie to take up Strathclyde University role|website=BBC News|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The directorates were responsible for transport, sustainable development and planning. In 2010, the transport directorate merged with [[Transport Scotland]], an [[List of Scottish Executive agencies|Executive Agency]] of the [[Scottish Government]] and accountable to [[Scottish Ministers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/docs/central/2010/fa_0910_transport_scotland.pdf|title=Report on the 2009/10 audit to Transport Scotland and the Auditor General for Scotland |last=|first=|date=November 2010|website=Audit Scotland|publisher=Transport Scotland|access-date=18 May  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Space Shuttle thermal protection system (TPS)''' is the [[Thermal protection system|barrier]] that protected the [[Space Shuttle Orbiter]] during the searing {{convert | 1650 | °C | °F| lk=on}} heat of [[Atmospheric entry|atmospheric reentry]]. A secondary goal was to protect from the heat and cold of space while in orbit.&lt;ref name="tech"&gt;{{cite book | last = Jenkins| first =Dennis R. | title =Space Shuttle: The History of the National Space Transportation System | publisher =Voyageur Press | year =2007 |isbn=0-9633974-5-1 | page =524 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==

[[File:Space Shuttle Endeavour at California Science Center (8143982281).jpg|thumb|400px|''Endeavour'' in a museum, showing tiles near door]]
The TPS covered essentially the entire orbiter surface, and consisted of seven different materials in varying locations based on amount of required heat protection:

* [[Reinforced carbon–carbon]] (RCC), used in the nose cap, the chin area between the nose cap and nose landing gear doors, the arrowhead aft of the nose landing gear door, and the wing leading edges. Used where reentry temperature exceeded {{convert | 1260 | °C | °F}}.
* High-temperature reusable surface insulation (HRSI) tiles, used on the orbiter underside. Made of coated [[LI-900]] Silica ceramics. Used where reentry temperature was below 1,260&amp;nbsp;°C.
* Fibrous refractory composite insulation (FRCI) tiles, used to provide improved strength, durability, resistance to coating cracking and weight reduction. Some HRSI tiles were replaced by this type.
* Flexible Insulation Blankets (FIB), a quilted, flexible blanket-like surface insulation. Used where reentry temperature was below {{convert | 649 | °C | °F}}.
* Low-temperature Reusable Surface Insulation (LRSI) tiles, formerly used on the upper fuselage, but were mostly replaced by FIB.  Used in temperature ranges roughly similar to FIB.
* Toughened unipiece fibrous insulation (TUFI) tiles, a stronger, tougher tile which came into use in 1996. Used in high and low temperature areas.
* Felt reusable surface insulation (FRSI).  White [[Nomex]] felt blankets on the upper payload bay doors, portions of the mid fuselage and aft fuselage sides, portions of the upper wing surface and a portion of the [[Orbital Maneuvering System|OMS/RCS]] pods. Used where temperatures stayed below {{convert | 371 | °C | °F}}.

Each type of TPS had specific heat protection, impact resistance, and weight characteristics, which determined the locations where it was used and the amount used.

The shuttle TPS has three key characteristics that distinguish it from the TPS used on previous spacecraft:

* Reusable. Previous spacecraft generally used [[atmospheric reentry#Thermal protection systems|ablative heat shields]] which burned off during reentry and so couldn't be reused.  This insulation was robust and reliable, and the single-use nature was appropriate for a single-use vehicle.  By contrast, the reusable shuttle required a reusable thermal protection system.
* Lightweight.  Previous ablative heat shields were very heavy.  For example, the ablative heat shield on the [[Apollo Command Module]] comprised about 15% of the vehicle weight.  The winged shuttle had much more surface area than previous spacecraft, so a lightweight TPS was crucial.
* Fragile.  The only known technology in the early 1970s with the required thermal and weight characteristics was also so fragile, due to the very low density, that one could easily crush a TPS tile by hand.

==Why TPS is needed==
[[File:Ststpstile.jpg|thumb|''Discovery'''s under wing surfaces are protected by thousands of High-Temperature Reusable Insulation tiles.]]
The orbiter's aluminum structure could not withstand temperatures over {{convert | 175 | °C | °F}} without structural failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/TPS/Tech41.htm |title=Shuttle Thermal Protection System (TPS) |publisher=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission |first=Dwayne A. |last=Day |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826033923/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/TPS/Tech41.htm |archivedate=2006-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aerodynamic heating during reentry would push the temperature well above this level in areas, so an effective insulator was needed.

===Reentry heating===
[[File:634813616 6957ab3307 o.jpg|thumb|A closer view of the tiles under the forward fuselage and the front end of the left wing. The corner of the nose-gear door can be seen at the lower left. The dark solid black tiles are new ones which have yet to go through a reentry. (At top, the white object is the open left cargo bay door.)]]Reentry heating differs from the normal atmospheric heating associated with jet aircraft, and this governed TPS design and characteristics. The skin of high-speed jet aircraft can also become hot, but this is from frictional heating due to atmospheric [[friction]], similar to warming one's hands by rubbing them together. The orbiter reentered the atmosphere as a [[Atmospheric reentry#Blunt body entry vehicles|blunt body]] by having a very high (40-degree) [[angle of attack]], with its broad lower surface facing the direction of flight. Over 80% of the heating the orbiter experiences during reentry&lt;!--Wayne Hale said in a press conference that it's something like 90%, but in case my memory is off I'm being conservative--&gt; is caused by compression of the air ahead of the hypersonic vehicle, in accordance with the basic [[Gas laws|thermodynamic relation between pressure and temperature]].  A hot [[shock wave]] was created in front of the vehicle, which deflected most of the heat and prevented the orbiter's surface from directly contacting the peak heat.  Therefore reentry heating was largely [[Convection|convective heat transfer]] between the shock wave and the orbiter's skin through superheated [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].&lt;ref name="tech"/&gt; The key to a reusable shield against this type of heating is very low-density material, similar to how a [[thermos bottle]] inhibits convective heat transfer.{{Citation needed|reason=Need citation to substantiate that the thermos bottle analogy is correct and appropriate.|date=March 2009}}

Some high temperature metal alloys can withstand reentry heat; they simply get hot and re-radiate the absorbed heat. This technique, called "[[heat sink]]" thermal protection, was planned for the [[X-20 Dyna-Soar]] winged space vehicle.&lt;ref name="tech"/&gt; However, the amount of high-temperature metal required to protect a large vehicle like the Space Shuttle Orbiter would have been very heavy and entailed a severe penalty to the vehicle's performance.  Similarly, ablative TPS would be heavy, possibly disturb vehicle aerodynamics as it burned off during reentry, and require significant maintenance to reapply after each mission.  (Unfortunately, TPS tile, which was originally specified never to take debris strikes during launch, in practice also needed to be closely inspected and repaired after each landing, due to damage invariably incurred during ascent, even before new on-orbit inspection policies were established following the [[Space Shuttle Columbia Disaster|loss]] of [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']].)

== Detailed description ==
[[File:Shuttle tile.jpg|100px|thumb|Silica tile from ''Atlantis'']]

The TPS was a system of different protection types, not just silica tiles.  They are in two basic categories: tile TPS and non-tile TPS.&lt;ref name="tech"/&gt; The main selection criteria used the lightest weight protection capable of handling the heat in a given area.  However in some cases a heavier type was used if additional impact resistance was needed.  The FIB blankets were primarily adopted for reduced maintenance, not for thermal or weight reasons.

Much of the shuttle was covered with [[LI-900]] [[silica]] [[tile]]s, made from essentially very pure quartz sand.&lt;ref name="tech"/&gt;  The insulation prevented heat transfer to the underlying orbiter [[aluminum]] skin and structure.  These tiles were such poor heat conductors that one could hold one by the edges while it was still red hot.&lt;ref name="NatGeo-1981"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
There were about 24,300 unique tiles individually fitted on the vehicle, for which the orbiter has been called "the flying brickyard". Researchers at [[University of Minnesota]] and  [[Pennsylvania State University]] are performing the atomistic simulations to obtain accurate description of interactions between atomic and molecular oxygen with silica surfaces to develop better high-temperature oxidation-protection systems for leading edges on hypersonic vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Oxygen Interactions with Silica Surfaces: Coupled Cluster and Density Functional Investigation and the Development of a New ReaxFF Potential| author = Anant D.

C]] | volume = 117 | pages = 258 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1021/jp3086649 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tiles were not mechanically fastened to the vehicle, but glued.  Since the brittle tiles could not flex with the underlying vehicle skin, they were glued to [[Nomex]] felt Strain Isolation Pads (SIPs) with RTV silicone adhesive, which were in turn glued to the orbiter skin.  These isolated the tiles from the orbiter's structural deflections and expansions.&lt;ref name="tech"/&gt;

===Tile types===

====High-temperature reusable surface insulation (HRSI)====
[[File:Silica Space Shuttle thermal protection (TPS) tile, c 1980. (9663807484).jpg|thumb|An HRSI tile. Note the yellow markings, which denote its exact location on the orbiter.]]
HRSI tiles (black in color) provided protection against temperatures up to {{convert|1260|°C|°F}}. There were 20,548 HRSI tiles which covered the landing gear doors, [[Space Shuttle External Tank|external tank]] umbilical connection doors, and the rest of the orbiter's under surfaces.  They were also used in areas on the upper forward fuselage, parts of the [[orbital maneuvering system]] pods, vertical stabilizer leading edge, [[elevon]] trailing edges, and upper body flap surface.  They varied in thickness from {{convert|1|to|5|in|cm}}, depending upon the heat load encountered during reentry.  Except for closeout areas, these tiles were normally {{convert|6|by|6|in|cm}} square. The HRSI tile was composed of high purity silica fibers. Ninety percent of the volume of the tile was empty space, giving it a very low density ({{convert|9|lb/ft3|kg/m3|disp=or|abbr=on}}) making it light enough for spaceflight.&lt;ref name="tech"/&gt;  The uncoated tiles were bright white in appearance and looked more like a solid ceramic than the foam-like material that they were.

The black coating on the tiles was Reaction Cured Glass (RCG) of which [[tetrasilicide]] and [[borosilicate]] glass were some of several ingredients.  RCG was applied to all but one side of the tile to protect the porous [[silica]] and to increase the heat sink properties.  The coating was absent from a small margin of the sides adjacent to the uncoated (bottom) side.  To waterproof the tile, dimethylethoxysilane was injected into the tiles by syringe. Densifying the tile with [[tetraethyl orthosilicate]] (TEOS) also helped to protect the silica and added additional waterproofing.
[[File:Space Shuttle (HRSI tile).png|634x634px|center|&lt;nowiki&gt;https://akk.li/pics/&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''anne'''/'''jpg''']]

An uncoated HRSI tile held in the hand feels like a very light foam, less dense than [[styrofoam]], and the delicate, [[friable]] material must be handled with extreme care to prevent damage.  The coating feels like a thin, hard shell and encapsulates the white insulating ceramic to resolve its friability, except on the uncoated side.  Even a coated tile feels very light, lighter than a same-sized block of styrofoam.  As expected for silica, they are odorless and inert.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

HRSI was primarily designed to withstand transition from areas of extremely low temperature (the void of space, about {{convert|-270|°C|°F|0|disp=or}}) to the high temperatures of re-entry (caused by interaction, mostly compression at the hypersonic shock, between the gases of the upper atmosphere &amp; the hull of the Space Shuttle, typically around {{convert|1600|°C|°F|disp=or}}).&lt;ref name="tech"/&gt;

====Fibrous Refractory Composite Insulation Tiles (FRCI)====
The black FRCI tiles provided improved durability, resistance to coating cracking and weight reduction. Some HRSI tiles were replaced by this type.&lt;ref name="tech"/&gt;

====Toughened unipiece fibrous insulation (TUFI)====
A stronger, tougher tile which came into use in 1996. TUFI tiles came in high temperature black versions for use in the orbiter's underside, and lower temperature white versions for use on the upper body. While more impact resistant than other tiles, white versions conducted more heat which limited their use to the orbiter's upper body flap and main engine area. Black versions had sufficient heat insulation for the orbiter underside but had greater weight. These factors restricted their use to specific areas.&lt;ref name="tech"/&gt;

====Low-temperature reusable surface insulation (LRSI)====
White in color, these covered the upper wing near the leading edge.  They were also used in selected areas of the forward, mid, and aft fuselage, vertical tail, and the OMS/RCS pods.  These tiles protected areas where reentry temperatures are below {{convert|1200|°F|°C}}.  The LRSI tiles were manufactured in the same manner as the HRSI tiles, except that the tiles were {{convert|8|by|8|in|cm}} square and had a white RCG coating made of silica compounds with shiny aluminum oxide.&lt;ref name="tech"/&gt;  The white color was by design and helped to manage heat on orbit when the orbiter was exposed to direct sunlight.

These tiles were reusable for up to 100 missions with refurbishment (100 missions was also the design lifetime of each orbiter).  They were carefully inspected in the [[Orbiter Processing Facility]] after each mission, and damaged or worn tiles were immediately replaced before the next mission.  Fabric sheets known as [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system#Gap fillers|gap fillers]] were also inserted between tiles where necessary.  These allowed for a snug fit between tiles, preventing excess plasma from penetrating between them, yet allowing for [[thermal expansion]] and flexing of the underlying vehicle skin.

Prior to the introduction of FIB blankets, LRSI tiles occupied all of the areas now covered by the blankets, including the upper fuselage and the whole surface of the OMS pods. This TPS configuration was only used on ''Columbia'' and ''Challenger''.

===Non-tile TPS===

====Flexible Insulation Blankets/Advanced Flexible Reusable Insulation (FIB/AFRSI)====
Developed after the initial delivery of ''Columbia'' and first used on the [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|OMS pods]] of ''Challenger''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STS-6 Press Information|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/shuttle_pk/mrk/FLIGHT_006_STS-006_MRK.pdf|publisher=Rockwell International – Space Transportation &amp; Systems Group|accessdate=12 July 2013|page=7|date=March 1983|quote="Orbital maneuvering system/reaction control system low temperature reusable surface insulation tiles (LRSI) replaced with advanced flexible reusable surface insulation (AFRSI) consisting of a sewn composite quilted fabric blanket with same silica tile material sandwiched between outer and inner blanket."}}&lt;/ref&gt; This white low-density fibrous silica batting material had a quilt-like appearance, and replaced the vast majority of the LRSI tiles. They required much less maintenance than LRSI tiles yet had about the same thermal properties. After their limited use on ''Challenger'', they were used much more extensively beginning with ''Discovery'' and replaced many of the LRSI tiles on ''Columbia'' after the loss of ''Challenger''.

====Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC)====
{{Main|Reinforced carbon–carbon}}
The light gray material which withstood reentry temperatures up to {{convert | 1510 | °C | °F}} protected the wing leading edges and nose cap. Each of the orbiters' wings had 22 [[Reinforced Carbon-Carbon|RCC]] panels about {{convert|1/4|to|1/2|in}} thick. T-seals between each panel allowed for thermal expansion and lateral movement between these panels and the wing.

RCC was a [[laminated]] composite material made from [[carbon fibres]] impregnated with a [[phenolic resin]]. After curing at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate was [[Pyrolysis|pyrolized]] to convert the resin to pure carbon. This was then impregnated with [[furfural]] alcohol in a vacuum chamber, then cured and pyrolized again to convert the furfural alcohol to carbon. This process was repeated three times until the desired carbon-carbon properties were achieved.

To provide oxidation resistance for reuse capability, the outer layers of the RCC were coated with silicon carbide. The silicon-carbide coating protected the carbon-carbon from oxidation. The RCC was highly resistant to fatigue loading that was experienced during ascent and entry. It was stronger than the tiles and was also used around the socket of the forward attach point of the orbiter to the External Tank to accommodate the shock loads of the explosive bolt detonation.  RCC was the only TPS material that also served as structural support for part of the orbiter's aerodynamic shape: the wing leading edges and the nose cap.  All other TPS components (tiles and blankets) were mounted onto structural materials that supported them, mainly the aluminum frame and skin of the orbiter.

====Nomex Felt Reusable Surface Insulation (FRSI)====
This white, flexible fabric offered protection at up to {{convert | 371 | °C | °F}}. FRSI covered the orbiter's upper wing surfaces, upper payload bay doors, portions of the OMS/RCS pods, and aft fuselage.

====Gap fillers====
Gap fillers were placed at doors and moving surfaces to minimize heating by preventing the formation of vortices. Doors and moving surfaces created open gaps in the heat protection system that had to be protected from heat. Some of these gaps were safe, but there were some areas on the heat shield where surface pressure gradients caused a crossflow of boundary layer air in those gaps.

The filler materials were made of either white AB312 fibers or black AB312 cloth covers (which contain alumina fibers).  These materials were used around the leading edge of the nose cap, windshields, side hatch, wing, trailing edge of elevons, vertical stabilizer, the rudder/speed brake, body flap, and heat shield of the shuttle's main engines.

On [[STS-114]], some of this material was dislodged and determined to pose a potential safety risk.  It was possible that the gap filler could cause turbulent airflow further down the fuselage, which would result in much higher heating, potentially damaging the orbiter. The cloth was removed during a [[spacewalk]] during the mission.

===Weight considerations===
While RCC had the best heat protection characteristics, it was also much heavier than the silica tiles and FIB blankets, so it was limited to relatively small areas. In general the goal was to use the lightest weight insulation consistent with the required thermal protection. Weight per unit volume of each TPS type:

*RCC: 1986 [[Kilogram per cubic metre|kg/m³]] (124&amp;nbsp;lb/ft³)
*LI-2200 tiles: 352&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ (22&amp;nbsp;lb/ft³)
*FRCI tiles: 192&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ (12&amp;nbsp;lb/ft³)
*[[LI-900]] (black or white) tiles: 144&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ (9&amp;nbsp;lb/ft³)
*FIB blankets: 144&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ (9&amp;nbsp;lb/ft³)

===Slow tile application===
[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|566175main Columbia-opf|''Columbia'' in the Orbiter Processing Facility after its arrival at Kennedy Space Center on 25 March 1979, showing many missing tiles. 7,800 of 31,000 tiles were still to be attached.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/02/space-shuttle-columbia-a-new-beginning-and-vision/]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Tiles often fell off and caused much of the delay in the launch of [[STS-1]], the first shuttle mission, which was originally scheduled for 1979 but did not occur until April 1981. NASA was unused to lengthy delays in its programs, and was under great pressure from the government and military to launch soon. In March 1979 it moved the incomplete ''Columbia'', with 7,800 of the 31,000 tiles missing, from the [[Rockwell International]] plant in [[Palmdale, California]] to [[Kennedy Space Center]] in [[Florida]]. Beyond creating the appearance of progress in the program, NASA hoped that the tiling could be finished while the rest of the orbiter was prepared. This was a mistake; some of the Rockwell tilers disliked Florida and soon returned to California, and the [[Orbiter Processing Facility]] was not designed for manufacturing and was too small for its 400 workers.{{r|lewis1984}}

Each tile used cement that required 16 hours to [[curing (chemistry)|cure]]. After the tile was affixed to the cement, a [[jack (device)|jack]] held it in place for another 16 hours. In March 1979 it took each worker 40 hours to install one tile; by using young, efficient college students during the summer the pace sped up to 1.8 tiles per worker per week. Thousands of tiles failed [[stress testing|stress tests]] and had to be replaced. By fall NASA realized that the speed of tiling would determine the launch date. The tiles were so problematic that officials would have switched to any other thermal protection method, but none other existed.&lt;ref name="lewis1984"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0cG1SdLkP0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=The voyages of Columbia: the first true spaceship |last=Lewis, Richard S. |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-231-05924-8 |pages=83-91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it had to be ferried without all tiles the gaps were filled with material to maintain the Shuttle's aerodynamics while in transit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/flyout/opf_home.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concern over "zipper effect"===
The tile TPS was an area of concern during shuttle development, mainly concerning adhesion reliability.  Some engineers thought a failure mode could exist whereby one tile could detach, and resulting aerodynamic pressure would create a "zipper effect" stripping off other tiles.  Whether during ascent or reentry, the result would be disastrous.

===Concern over debris strikes===
Another problem was ice or other debris impacting the tiles during ascent.  This had never been fully and thoroughly solved, as the debris had never been eliminated, and the tiles remained susceptible to damage from it.  NASA's final strategy for mitigating this problem was to aggressively inspect for, assess, and address any damage that may occur, while on orbit and before reentry, in addition to on the ground between flights.

===Early tile repair plans===
These concerns were sufficiently great that NASA did significant work developing an emergency-use tile repair kit which the [[STS-1]] crew could use before deorbiting. By December 1979, prototypes and early procedures were completed, most of which involved equipping the astronauts with a special in-space repair kit and a jet pack called the [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]], or MMU, developed by Martin Marietta.

Another element was a maneuverable work platform which would secure an MMU-propelled spacewalking astronaut to the fragile tiles beneath the orbiter. The concept used electrically-controlled adhesive cups which would lock the work platform into position on the featureless tile surface. About one year before the 1981 STS-1 launch, NASA decided the repair capability was not worth the additional risk and training, so discontinued development.&lt;ref&gt;''Houston Chronicle'', March 9, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  There were unresolved problems with the repair tools and techniques; also further tests indicated the tiles were unlikely to come off.  The first shuttle mission did suffer several tile losses, but they were in non-critical areas, and no "zipper effect" occurred.

==''Columbia'' accident and aftermath==
{{Main|Space Shuttle Columbia disaster}}
On February 1, 2003, the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] was destroyed on reentry due to a failure of the TPS.  The investigation team found and reported that the probable cause of the accident was that during launch, a piece of foam debris punctured an [[Reinforced carbon–carbon|RCC]] panel on the left wing's leading edge and allowed hot gases from the reentry to enter the wing and disintegrate the wing from within, leading to eventual loss of control and breakup of the shuttle.

The [[Space Shuttle]]'s thermal protection system received a number of controls and modifications after the disaster.  They were applied to the three remaining shuttles, ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' in preparation for subsequent mission launches into space.

On 2005's [[STS-114]] mission, in which ''Discovery'' made the first flight to follow the ''Columbia'' accident, NASA took a number of steps to verify that the TPS was undamaged.  The {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Orbiter Boom Sensor System]], a new extension to the [[Remote Manipulator System]], was used to perform laser imaging of the TPS to inspect for damage.  Prior to docking with the [[International Space Station]], ''Discovery'' performed a [[Rendezvous Pitch Maneuver]], simply a 360° backflip rotation, allowing all areas of the vehicle to be photographed from ISS.  Two gap fillers were protruding from the orbiter's underside more than the nominally allowed distance, and the agency cautiously decided it would be best to attempt to remove the fillers or cut them flush rather than risk the increased heating they would cause.  Even though each one protruded less than {{convert|3|cm|abbr=on}}, it was believed that leaving them could cause heating increases of 25% upon reentry.

Because the orbiter did not have any handholds on its underside (as they would cause much more trouble with reentry heating than the protruding gap fillers of concern), astronaut [[Stephen K. Robinson]] worked from the ISS's robotic arm, [[Canadarm2]].  Because the TPS tiles were quite fragile, there had been concern that anyone working under the vehicle could cause more damage to the vehicle than was already there, but NASA officials felt that leaving the gap fillers alone was a greater risk.  In the event, Robinson was able to pull the gap fillers free by hand, and caused no damage to the TPS on ''Discovery''.

==Tile Donations==
{{asof|2010}}, with the impending [[Space Shuttle retirement]], NASA is donating TPS tiles to schools, universities, and museums for the cost of shipping;  {{currency|23.40|USD}} each.&lt;ref name=tiles&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cfnews13.com/article/news/2010/december/178743/NASA-offers-space-shuttle-tiles-to-school-and-universities  |title=NASA offers space shuttle tiles to school and universities |date=December 1, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708133214/http://www.cfnews13.com/article/news/2010/december/178743/NASA-offers-space-shuttle-tiles-to-school-and-universities |archivedate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 7000 tiles were available on a [[first-come, first-served]] basis, but limited to one each per institution.&lt;ref name=tiles/&gt;

'''Spacelab''' was a reusable laboratory used on certain [[spaceflight]]s flown by the [[Space Shuttle]]. The laboratory comprised multiple components, including a pressurized module, an unpressurized carrier and other related hardware housed in the Shuttle's cargo bay. The components were arranged in various configurations to meet the needs of each spaceflight.

Spacelab components flew on a total of 32 Shuttle missions. Spacelab allowed scientists to perform experiments in [[microgravity]] in earth orbit. There was a variety of Spacelab-associated hardware, so a distinction can be made between the major Spacelab program missions with European scientists running missions in the Spacelab habitable module, missions running other Spacelab hardware experiments, and other STS missions that used some component of Spacelab hardware. There is some variation in counts of Spacelab missions, in part because there were different types of Spacelab missions with a large range in the amount of Spacelab hardware flown and the nature of each mission. There were at least 22 major Spacelab missions between 1983 and 1998, and Spacelab hardware was used on a number other missions, with some of the Spacelab pallets being flown as late as 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Space_Shuttle/Spacelab|title=Spacelab|first=|last=esa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1973, [[NASA]] and [[ESRO]] (now [[European Space Agency]] or ESA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to build a science laboratory for use on Space Shuttle flights.&lt;ref&gt;Lord 1987, pp. 24–28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction of Spacelab was started in 1974 by the [[Entwicklungsring Nord|ERNO]] (subsidiary of [[VFW-Fokker GmbH]], after merger with [[Messerschmitt|MBB]] named MBB/ERNO, and part of [[EADS SPACE Transportation]] since 2003). The first lab module, ''LM1'', was donated to NASA in exchange for flight opportunities for European astronauts.  A second module, ''LM2'', was bought by [[NASA]] for its own use from ERNO.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/1a.pdf Space Transportation System – HAER No. TX-116 – p. 46. Quote: "..Later, NASA purchased LM2, the second lab"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction on the Spacelab modules began in 1974 by what then the company ERNO-VFW-Fokker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/1a.pdf Space Transportation System – HAER No. TX-116 – p. 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Spacelab is important to all of us for at least four good reasons. It expanded the Shuttle's ability to conduct science on-orbit manyfold. It provided a marvelous opportunity and example of a large international joint venture involving government, industry, and science with our European allies. The European effort provided the free world with a really versatile laboratory system several years before it would have been possible if the United States had had to fund it on its own. And finally, it provided Europe with the systems development and management experience they needed to move into the exclusive manned space flight arena.|NASA Administrator, ''Spacelab: An International Success Story''&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19880009991.pdf ''Spacelab: An International Success Story'' Forward by NASA Administrator James C.

In addition to the laboratory module, the complete set also included five external pallets for experiments in vacuum built by [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) and a pressurized Igloo containing the subsystems needed for the pallet-only flight configuration operation. Eight flight configurations were qualified, though more could be assembled if needed.

Spacelab consisted of a variety of interchangeable components, with the major one being manned laboratory that could be flown in Space Shuttle orbiter's bay and returned to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSzfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA393&amp;lpg=PA393&amp;dq=Habitable+module+spacelab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-YyHYzpw--&amp;sig=o6PYkda1jq0BjAFD-rMJSXa7Eoo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79IOn3Z7cAhUDDKwKHfrBAxUQ6AEIlwEwEA#v=onepage&amp;q=Habitable%20module%20spacelab&amp;f=false|title=Dictionary of Space Technology|last=Angelo|first=Joseph|date=2013-10-31|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135944025|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the habitable module did not have to be flown to conduct a Spacelab-type mission and there was a variety of pallets and other hardware supporting space research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSzfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA393&amp;lpg=PA393&amp;dq=Habitable+module+spacelab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-YyHYzpw--&amp;sig=o6PYkda1jq0BjAFD-rMJSXa7Eoo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79IOn3Z7cAhUDDKwKHfrBAxUQ6AEIlwEwEA#v=onepage&amp;q=Habitable%20module%20spacelab&amp;f=false|title=Dictionary of Space Technology|last=Angelo|first=Joseph|date=2013-10-31|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135944025|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Habitable module expanded the volume for astronauts to work in a [[Shirt-sleeve environment|shirt sleeve environment]] and had space for equipment racks and related support equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSzfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA393&amp;lpg=PA393&amp;dq=Habitable+module+spacelab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-YyHYzpw--&amp;sig=o6PYkda1jq0BjAFD-rMJSXa7Eoo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79IOn3Z7cAhUDDKwKHfrBAxUQ6AEIlwEwEA#v=onepage&amp;q=Habitable%20module%20spacelab&amp;f=false|title=Dictionary of Space Technology|last=Angelo|first=Joseph|date=2013-10-31|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135944025|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the habitable module was not used, some of the support equipment for the pallets could be housed in the smaller ''Igloo'', a pressurized cylinder connected to the Space Shuttle orbiter crew area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSzfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA393&amp;lpg=PA393&amp;dq=Habitable+module+spacelab&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-YyHYzpw--&amp;sig=o6PYkda1jq0BjAFD-rMJSXa7Eoo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79IOn3Z7cAhUDDKwKHfrBAxUQ6AEIlwEwEA#v=onepage&amp;q=Habitable%20module%20spacelab&amp;f=false|title=Dictionary of Space Technology|last=Angelo|first=Joseph|date=2013-10-31|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135944025|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spacelab Module comprises a cylindrical main laboratory configurable as Short or Long Module flown in the rear of the Space Shuttle cargo bay, connected to the crew compartment by a tunnel.  The laboratory had an outer diameter of {{convert|4.12|m|ft|sp=us}}, and each segment a length of {{convert|2.7|m|ft|sp=us}}. Most of the time two segments were used in forming the Long Module configuration.

=== Pallet ===
[[Image:STS-75 Tethered Satellite System deployment.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tethered Satellite System]] deployment, deployed from Spacelab pallet]]
The Spacelab Pallet is a U-shaped platform for mounting instrumentation, large instruments, experiments requiring exposure to space, and instruments requiring a large field of view, such as telescopes.  The pallet has several hard points for mounting heavy equipment.  The pallet can be used in single configuration or stacked end to end in double or triple configurations.  Up to five pallets can be configured in the Space Shuttle cargo bay by using a double pallet plus triple pallet configurations.

The Spacelab Pallet used to transport both [[Canadarm-2]] and [[Dextre]] to the International Space Station is currently at the [[Canada Aviation and Space Museum]], on loan from NASA through the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA).&lt;ref name=SLP-D1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aviation.technomuses.ca/media/press_releases/20sep12/|title=Spacelab pallet completes its long journey arriving at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Spacelab Pallet was transferred to the Swiss Museum of Transport for permanent display on 5 March 2010. The Pallet, nicknamed ''Elvis'', was used during the eight-day STS-46 mission, 31 July – 8 August 1992, when ESA astronaut Claude Nicollier was on board Shuttle Atlantis to deploy ESA's European Retrievable Carrier (Eureca) scientific mission and the joint NASA/[[Italian Space Agency]] [[Tether satellite|Tethered Satellite]] System (TSS-1). The Pallet carried TSS-1 in the Shuttle's cargo bay.&lt;ref name=ESA-STS46&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Operations/SEMQGN6K56G_0.html|title=ESA hands over a piece of space history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Spacelab pallet is on display at the U.S. [[National Air and Space Museum]] in Washington, DC&lt;Ref&gt;[https://www.si.edu/exhibitions/spacelab-pallet-3462]&lt;/ref&gt; Overall there was ten space-flown Spacelab pallets.&lt;Ref&gt;https://www.space.com/23796-spacelab-space-shuttle-30-years-anniversary.html]&lt;/reF&gt;

=== Igloo ===
On spaceflight where a habitable module was not flown, but pallets were flown, a pressurized cylinder known as the ''igloo'' carried the subsystems needed to operate the Spacelab equipment.&lt;ref name=HS-book&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Spaceflight|author=Joseph A. Angelo|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing|Facts on File]]|page=272|date=2007|isbn=0-8160-5775-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Igloo was 10 feet tall, had a diameter of 5 feet, and weighed 2,500&amp;nbsp;lb.&lt;ref name=NASM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19990001003|title=Spacelab Subsystems Igloo|publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]]|accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two igloo units were manufactured, both by Belgium company [[Société Anonyme Belge de Constructions Aéronautiques|SABCA]], and both were used on spaceflight.&lt;ref name=NASM/&gt; An igloo component was flown on Spacelab 2, Astro-1, ATLAS-1, ATLAS-2, ATLAS-3, and Astro-2.&lt;ref name=NASM/&gt;

A Spacelab Igloo is on display at the James S. McDonnell Space Hangar at the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/spacelab-subsystems-igloo|title=Spacelab, Subsystems Igloo|date=2016-04-09|work=National Air and Space Museum|access-date=2018-07-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instrument Pointing System ===
The IPS was a gimbaled pointing device, capable of aiming telescopes, cameras, or other instruments.&lt;ref name="airandspace.si.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/spacelab-instrument-pointing-system|title=Spacelab, Instrument Pointing System|date=17 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPS was used on three different space shuttle missions between 1985 and 1995.&lt;ref name="airandspace.si.edu"/&gt; IPS was manufactured by Dornier, and two units were made.&lt;ref name="airandspace.si.edu"/&gt; The IPS was primarily constructed out of aluminum, steel, and [[multi-layer insulation]].&lt;reF&gt;[https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/spacelab-instrument-pointing-system]&lt;/ref&gt;

IPS would be mounted inside the payload bay of the Space Shuttle Orbiter, and could provide gimbaled 3-axis pointing.&lt;ReF&gt;[https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/spacelab-instrument-pointing-system]&lt;/reF&gt; It was designed for a pointing accuracy of less than 1 arcsecond (a unit of degree), and three pointing modes including Earth, Sun, and Stellar focused modes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heusmann|first=H|last2=Wolf|first2=P|date=1985-10-31|title=The Spacelab Instrument Pointing System (IPS) and its first flight|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234272535_The_Spacelab_Instrument_Pointing_System_IPS_and_its_first_flight|journal=ESA Bulletin|volume=44|pages=75–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPS was mounted on a pallet exposed to outer space in the payload bay.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other Spacelab elements include the tunnel, and the Instrument Pointing System (IPS) tailored to the pallet interfaces for precise pointing to space or earth targets.

Spacelab was a modular re-usable space-hardware system designed for about 50 uses over ten years, with a contract signed for its construction in 1974. It had components like a manned orbiting observatory in the Shuttle-bay, to various logistical hardware for experiments in space, to astronomy, and Earth observation.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The system had some unique features including an intended two-week turn-around time (for the original Space Shuttle launch turn-around time) and the roll-on-roll-off for loading in aircraft (Earth-transportation).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Spacelab components flew on 22 Space Shuttle missions from November 1983 to April 1998.&lt;ref name=StoryShuttle&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of the Space Shuttle |author=David Michael Harland |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] Praxis |date=2004 |page=444 |isbn=978-1-85233-793-3 |authorlink=David M. Harland}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spacelab components were decommissioned in 1998, except the pallets. Science work was moved to the [[International Space Station]] and [[Spacehab]] module, a pressurized carrier similar to the Spacelab Module.  A Spacelab Pallet was recommissioned in 2002 for flight on [[STS-99]]. The "Spacelab Pallet – Deployable 1 (SLP-D1) with Canadian [[Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator]], Dextre" was launched on [[STS-123]]. "Spacelab Pallet – Deployable 2 (SLP-D2)" was scheduled for [[STS-127]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  The Spacelab components were used on 32 Shuttle missions in total.

The habitable modules were flown on 16 Space Shuttle missions in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/23796-spacelab-space-shuttle-30-years-anniversary.html|title=Spacelab: Space Shuttle Flew Europe's First Space Module 30 Years Ago|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides contributing to ESA missions, [[Germany]] and [[Japan]] each funded their own Space Shuttle and Spacelab missions. Although superficially similar to other flights, they were actually the first and only non-U.S. and non-European manned space missions with complete German and Japanese control.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

[[File:STS-61-a-patch.png|thumb|right|The ''Deutschland-1'' orbital space plane flight, funded by West Germany, included over seven [[short ton|tons]] of German science research equipment]]
The first West German mission ''Deutschland 1'' (Spacelab-D1, DLR-1, NASA designation [[STS-61-A]]) took place in 1985. A second similar mission, ''Deutschland 2'' (Spacelab-D2, DLR-2, NASA designation [[STS-55]]), was first planned for 1988, but due to the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]], was delayed until 1993. It became the first German manned space mission after [[German reunification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/spp/guide/germany/piloted/index.html |title=Germany and Piloted Space Missions |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only Japan mission, Spacelab-J (NASA designation [[STS-47]]), took place in 1992.

=== Other missions ===
* [[STS-92]], October 2000, [[Pressurized Mating Adapter|PMA]]-3, ({{OV|103|full=no}})

* [[STS-123]], March 2008, Pallet ({{OV|105|full=no}}), [[Dextre]]

=== Cancelled missions ===
Spacelab-4, Spacelab-5 and other planned Spacelab missions were cancelled due to the late development of the Shuttle and the Challenger disaster.

The legacy of Spacelab lives on in the form of the [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module|MPLMs]] and the systems derived from it. These systems include the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]] and [[Cygnus spacecraft|Cygnus]] spacecraft used to transfer payloads to the [[International Space Station]], and the [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]], [[Harmony (ISS module)|Harmony]] and [[Tranquility (ISS module)|Tranquility]] modules of the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/columbus/newspaper/ESA_ColumbusLab_newspaper_ENG.pdf|title=A new European science laboratory in Earth orbit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/03-Walz_Cygnus_Beyond_Low-Earth_Orbit.pdf|title=Cygnus Beyond Low-Earth Orbit – Logistics and Habitation in Cis-Lunar Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spacelab 2 mission surveyed 60% of the galactic plane in infrared in 1985.&lt;ref name="ipac.caltech.edu"/&gt;

Spacelab was an extremely large program, and this was enhanced by different experiments and multiple payloads and configurations over two decades. For example, in a subset of just one part of the Spacelab 1 (STS-9) mission, no less than 8 different imaging systems were flown into space. Including those experiments, there was a total of 73 separate experiments across different disciplines on the Spacelab 1 flight alone. Spacelab missions conducted experiments in materials, life, solar, astrophysics, atmospheric, and Earth science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/s/spacelab|title=Spacelab - eoPortal Directory - Satellite Missions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Spacelab represents a major investment on the order of one billion dollars from our European friends. But its completion marks something equally important: The commitment of a dogged, dedicated, and talented team drawn from ESA Governments, universities, and industries who stuck with it for a decade and saw the project through.

'''''SuperFreakonomics: Global Cooling, Patriotic Prostitutes, and Why Suicide Bombers Should Buy Life Insurance''''' is the second non-fiction book by [[University of Chicago]] economist [[Steven Levitt]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' journalist [[Stephen J. Dubner]], released in early October 2009 in Europe and on October 20, 2009 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/superfreakonomics-is-out-today/?pagemode=print SuperFreakonomics Is Out Today]'', 2009-10-20&lt;/ref&gt; It is a sequel to ''[[Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything]]''.

==Synopsis==
The explanatory note states that the theme of the book explores the concept that we all work for a particular reward. The introduction states we should look at problems economically. The examples given include the preference for sons in [[India]] and the hardships Indian women face, as well as the horse manure issue at the turn of the 20th century.

The first chapter explores prostitution and pimps in South [[Chicago]], one high class escort, and real estate brokers. The pimps and brokers are compared based on the idea that they are helping to sell one's services to the larger market. Inequalities in pay grades for men and women are also covered in the chapter.

The second chapter is about patterns and details. Patterns in the ages of soccer players, health issues of children in the womb during [[Ramadan]], and the upbringings of terrorists are observed. Next, the book discusses the skills of hospital doctors and how [[Microsoft Amalga|Azyxxi]] was created, and draws parallels to how terrorists in the UK were tracked down by banks.

Altruism is discussed in the third chapter, and uses examples of the [[murder of Kitty Genovese]], crime rates as affected by television, and economic experimental games such as [[prisoner's dilemma]], [[Ultimatum game|ultimatum]], and the work of [[John A. List]].

The fourth chapter is about [[unintended consequences]] and simple fixes. It goes into detail about [[Ignaz Semmelweis]]' work in hospitals, use of seatbelts and child seats, and the possibility of reducing hurricanes.

The fifth chapter discusses [[externality|externalities]] and [[global warming]]. It discusses how economics does not necessarily take environmental issues into account. Further, the authors posit an alternative way of solving global warming by adding sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere.

The epilogue is about [[microeconomics]], and discusses [[Capuchin monkey#Intelligence|a study]] as to whether monkeys can be trained to use money.

== Reception ==
''SuperFreakonomics'' has been praised for its entertainment value, but has drawn criticism for taking unconventional approaches to its subject matter, particularly [[global warming]].

In the ''[[Financial Times]]'', [[Tim Harford]], author of ''[[The Undercover Economist]]'', said that ''SuperFreakonomics'' "is a lot like ''[[Freakonomics]]'', but better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/1c1d0386-b9e4-11de-a747-00144feab49a,print=yes.html|title=SuperFreakonomics|last=Harford|first=Tim|date=2009-10-17|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[New York Post]]'', critic and novelist [[Kyle Smith]] described the book as "brave, bracing and beautifully contrarian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/f/print/news/opinion/books/superfreakonomics_MPfMLOTdyRDHe2qb72LEmO|title=SuperFreakonomics|last=Smith|first=Kyle|date=2009-10-18|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' gave the book three and a half stars out of five, saying that the book is "[a]n inventive and even useful application of economics to unusual subjects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_44/b4153074945496.htm|title=More Oddball Tales for Freakonomics Fans|last=Coy|first=Peter|date=2009-10-22|newspaper=[[BusinessWeek]]|accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global warming section===
In the book's fifth chapter, the author proposes that the [[climate system]] can be [[Climate engineering|intentionally regulated]] by construction of a [[stratoshield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intellectualventureslab.com/?tag=stratoshield|title=Introducing the Stratoshield|date=2009-10-21|publisher=Intellectual Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chapter has been criticized by economists and climate science experts who say it contains numerous misleading statements and discredited arguments, including this presentation of geoengineering as a replacement for {{chem|link=Carbon dioxide|CO|2}} emissions reduction.  Among the critics are [[Paul Krugman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/17/superfreakonomics-on-climate-part-1/ |title=SuperFreakonomics on climate, part 1 |first=Paul |last=Krugman |date=2009-10-17 |quote=they grossly misrepresent other peoples' research, in both climate science and economics | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J.

[[Joseph Romm]] said that ''SuperFreakonomics'' had seriously misrepresented the position of climate scientist [[Ken Caldeira]];&lt;ref name="romm"&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Romm |authorlink=Joe Romm |title=Anatomy of a debunking |url=http://climateprogress.org/2009/10/19/anatomy-of-a-debunking-yes-caldeira-says-superfreakonomics-is-damaging-to-me-because-it-is-an-inaccurate-portrayal-of-me-and-filled-with-many-statements-that-are-misleading-statements-a/print/ |work=climateprogress.org |date=2009-10-19|quote=He [Caldeira] has responded to many e-mail queries of mine over the weekend. He simply doesn’t believe what the Superfreaks make it seem like he believes...One sentence about Caldeira in particular is the exact opposite of what he believes (page 184): ‘Yet his research tells him that carbon dioxide is not the right villain in this fight.’ Levitt and Dubner didn’t run this quote by Caldeira, and when he saw a version from Myhrvold, he objected to it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the book says among other things, that Caldeira's research tells him {{CO2}} is "not the right villain", an assertion Caldeira strongly disputes.&lt;ref name="e360"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2201 |title=Geoengineering the Planet: The Possibilities and the Pitfalls (Caldeira interview) |publisher=Yale Environment 360 |first=Jeff |last=Goodell |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2009-10-22 |quote=the actual statements attributed to me are based on fact, but the contexts and the framing of those issues are very different from the context and framing that I would put those same facts in...So I think that the casual reader can... come up with a misimpression of what I believe and what I feel about things. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124182854/http://e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2201 |archivedate=2009-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Caldeira has commented {{quote|I believe all of the ideas attributed to me are based on fact, with the exception of the 'carbon dioxide is not the right villain' line. That said, when I am speaking, I place these facts in a very different context and draw different policy conclusions.... I believe the authors to have worked in good faith. They draw different conclusions than I draw from the same facts, but as authors of the book, that is their prerogative.&lt;ref name="nyt1018"/&gt;}}
Dubner responded that with hindsight the line describing Ken Caldeira overstated his position, but noted that Caldeira had been sent a preview of the text and had approved it.&lt;ref name="nyt1018"/&gt;

Caldeira has acknowledged that he did receive the preview,&lt;ref name="nyt1018"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/18/global-warming-in-superfreakonomics-the-anatomy-of-a-smear/|work=The New York Times|first=Stephen J. |last=Dubner|title=Global Warming in SuperFreakonomics: The Anatomy of a Smear|date=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but disagreed that the errors were his responsibility: "I feel no need to read, fact check, or make detailed comments on documents that arrive in my in-box. I have lots of other things to do, like trying to get my science out the door."&lt;ref name="riddled"&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Romm |authorlink=Joe Romm |title=Part 5: Error-riddled SuperFreakonomics claims Caldeira’s 'research tells him that carbon dioxide is not the right villain'. Caldeira updates his website to read 'Carbon dioxide is the right villain.' |url=http://climateprogress.org/2009/10/18/error-riddled-superfreakonomics-stephen-dubner-says-romm-has-done-a-great-job-amazon-search/ |work=climateprogress.org |date=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As it transpired, Dubner had been apprised of Caldeira's objection to the "right villain" assertion, but did not delete the line as Caldeira expected, although Caldeira believes this was due to a good faith misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://warming101.blogspot.com/2009/10/caldeira-explains-right-villain-episode.html |title=Caldeira explains the "right villain" episode |date=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding their own views on global warming, Levitt and Dubner have stated on their ''[[Freakonomics]]'' blog that global warming is "[[human impact on the environment|a man-made phenomenon]]" and "an important issue to solve". They go on to explain that where they differ with the establishment view is in what the most effective solutions to that problem are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/17/the-rumors-of-our-global-warming-denial-are-greatly-exaggerated/|title=The Rumors of Our Global-Warming Denial Are Greatly Exaggerated|date=2009-10-17|quote=we believe that rising global temperatures are a man-made phenomenon and that global warming is an important issue to solve. Where we differ from the critics is in our view of the most effective solutions to this problem....The real purpose of the chapter is figuring out how to cool the Earth if indeed it becomes catastrophically warmer... if we weren't convinced that global warming was worth worrying about, we wouldn't have written a chapter about proposed solutions. | first=Steven D. | last=Levitt | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For an establishment review of how Levitt and Dubner use arithmetic in their dismissal of the solar photovoltaic option to mitigate global warming, see [[Raymond Pierrehumbert]]'s open letter to Stephen Levitt at Realclimate.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pierrehumbert|first=Raymond T|title=An Open Letter to Steve Levitt|url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/10/an-open-letter-to-steve-levitt/|accessdate=2013-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Telmatobacter'' was first described in 2011. The name derives from the Greek noun telma–atos, meaning swamp or bog, and the noun bacter meaning short rod.

==Description==
''Telmatobacter'' is a genus of [[Gram-negative bacteria]]. They appear as motile, single [[bacillus (shape)|rods]]. ''Telmatobacter'' reproduce by normal [[cell division]] and do not form spores. They are [[Facultative anaerobic organism|facultative anaerobes]] as well as [[Primary nutritional groups#Energy and carbon|chemo-organotrophs]]. They prefer to grow with [[sugar]]s and [[pectin]] as growth substrates, although they are capable of fermenting sugars and several [[polysaccharide]]s, including crystalline [[cellulose]]. They [[Acidophile|prefer acidic]] conditions and [[mesophile|moderate temperatures]], and they grow better on liquid medium than solid agar medium. Unlike some other bacteria, ''Telmatobacter'' do not produce [[hydrogen sulfide|hydrogen sulfide gas]] from [[thiosulfate]], nor [[indole]] from [[tryptophan]]. [[Sodium chloride|Salt]] inhibits growth at concentrations above 0.1% (w/v). The DNA [[GC-content|G+C content]] is 57.6%. ''Telmatobacter'' are found in acidic wetlands, specifically [[Sphagnum]] peat bogs. The only and type species is ''Telmatobacter bradus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bacterio.net/telmatobacter.html |accessdate=27 September 2016 |publisher=LPSN bacterio.net |title=Telmatobacter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything''''' is a 2012 nonfiction book by the technologist [[Michael J. Saylor]], founder, chairman, and CEO of [[MicroStrategy|MicroStrategy, Inc]]. ''The Mobile Wave'' provides an analysis of then-current trends in [[mobile technology]] from the point of view of a scholar of the history of science. The book argues that mobile devices will become essential tools for life in the modern day, changing how businesses operate and how industries and economies are powered.

In ''The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything'', Saylor argues that mobile technology will change how people live worldwide, affecting businesses, entire industries, and the very economies they power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |isbn=1593157207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
'''Chapter 1 - The Wave: The Shape of the Wave''' lays the foundation for some of the themes that occur throughout the book.  These include the universal nature of mobile devices, and how mobile and cloud computing technologies will continue to disrupt established industries and the old ways of doing business.  This chapter also introduces the ongoing Information Revolution as the third great revolution to transform society, after the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions.

'''Chapter 2 - Computers: The Evolution to Mobile Computing''' discusses the four great waves of computing described by technologists as leading to the fifth mobile wave: the mainframe, the minicomputer, the personal computer and the Internet PC.  Saylor writes that a critical turning point unleashing the mobile wave was triggered by Apple, with the introduction of the affordable iPhone and its App Store, multi-touch capabilities and built-in GPS.

'''Chapter 3 - Paper: The Demise of Paper''' covers a short history of media delivery systems, ranging from the first clay tablets around 3000 B.C., up to the highly disruptive electronic content transforming the print industry.  The chapter also discusses the benefits of electronic publishing, from distribution efficiencies that save money and protect the environment, to display format flexibility making the content more appealing.

'''Chapter 4 – Entertainment: The New Universal Screen''' describes how mobile technology has evolved to display movies, TV programming and video games.  The impact of content mobility on advertisers is also discussed.

'''Chapter 5 – Wallet: A Smarter Wallet and Intelligent Money''' covers a short history of money and payment systems, and describes the effect the mobile wave is having on banking systems, including offering greater security.

'''Chapter 6 – Social Networks: A Mobile Social World''' discusses how evolving mobile/social applications are changing society, including their impact on events ranging from 2010’s unrest in the Middle East, to the social activities of today’s teenagers.

'''Chapter 7 – Medicine: The New Landscape of Global Healthcare''' describes the impact of mobile technology on the medical industry.  Topics include the wide benefits of Telemedicine, improvements to medical record keeping, and technical advances to assist sight and hearing impaired people.

'''Chapter 8 – Education: Remaking Education for Everyone''' covers the positive disruption mobile technology brings to the education system.  Expanded access to affordable education along with improved learning and retention using mobile content are shown as two ways the mobile wave is improving education.

'''Chapter 9 – Developing World: Bootstrapping the Developing World''' highlights the benefits of mobile technology on Third World countries.   By facilitating an improved communications infrastructure, launching more secure, less corrupt financial transaction systems and enabling businesses to more easily sell their products where there’s higher demand, the developing world is already enjoying the benefits of the Mobile Wave.

'''Chapter 10 – New World: Human Energy Unleashed''' ties the book’s themes together again, including reiterating the transformative effects on business and society of mobile technology.  The privacy issue is touched upon, along with a suggestion that perhaps an electronic bill of rights type document could be useful to help navigate these issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6235">The '''zero-order hold''' ('''ZOH''') is a mathematical model of the practical [[signal reconstruction]] done by a conventional [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC).  That is, it describes the effect of converting a [[discrete-time signal]] to a [[continuous-time signal]] by holding each sample value for one sample interval. It has several applications in electrical communication.

==Time-domain model==

[[Image:Zeroorderhold.impulseresponse.svg|thumb|Figure 1.  The time-shifted and time-scaled rect function used in the time-domain analysis of the ZOH.]]
[[Image:Zeroorderhold.signal.svg|thumb|Figure 2.  Piecewise-constant signal ''x''&lt;sub&gt;ZOH&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').]]
[[Image:Sampled.signal.svg|thumb|Figure 3.  A modulated Dirac comb ''x''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').]]
A zero-order hold reconstructs the following continuous-time waveform from a sample sequence ''x''[''n''], assuming one sample per time interval ''T'':

:&lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{ZOH}}(t)\,= \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]\cdot \mathrm{rect} \left(\frac{t-T/2 -nT}{T} \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{rect}() \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[rectangular function]].

The function &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{rect} \left(\frac{t-T/2}{T} \right)&lt;/math&gt; is depicted in Figure 1, and &lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{ZOH}}(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[piecewise-constant]] signal depicted in Figure 2.

==Frequency-domain model==

The equation above for the output of the ZOH can also be modeled as the output of a [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant filter]] with impulse response equal to a rect function, and with input being a sequence of [[dirac delta function|dirac impulses]] scaled to the sample values.  The filter can then be analyzed in the frequency domain, for comparison with other reconstruction methods such as the [[Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula]] suggested by the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]], or such as the [[first-order hold]] or linear interpolation between sample values.

In this method, a sequence of [[dirac delta function|dirac impulses]], ''x''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), representing the discrete samples, ''x''[''n''], is [[low-pass filter]]ed to recover a [[continuous-time signal]], ''x''(''t'').

Even though this is ''not'' what a DAC does in reality, the DAC output can be modeled by applying the hypothetical sequence of dirac impulses, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), to a [[LTI system|linear, time-invariant filter]] with such characteristics (which, for an LTI system, are fully described by the [[impulse response]]) so that each input impulse results in the correct constant pulse in the output.

Begin by defining a continuous-time signal from the sample values, as above but using delta functions instead of rect functions:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x_s(t) &amp; = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]\cdot \delta\left(\frac{t - nT}{T}\right) \\
&amp; {} = T \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]\cdot \delta(t - nT).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The scaling by &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, which arises naturally by time-scaling the delta function, has the result that the mean value of ''x&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'') is equal to the mean value of the samples, so that the lowpass filter needed will have a DC gain of 1.  Some authors use this scaling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Principles of Digital Audio | author = Ken C. Pohlmann | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2000 | edition = fifth | ISBN = 0-07-144156-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; while many others omit the time-scaling and the ''T'', resulting in a low-pass filter model with a DC gain of ''T'', and hence dependent on the units of measurement of time.

[[Image:Zeroorderhold.impulseresponse.svg|thumb|Figure 4. Impulse response of zero-order hold ''h''&lt;sub&gt;ZOH&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'').  It is identical to the rect function of Figure 1, except now scaled to have an area of 1 so the filter will have a DC gain of 1.]]

The zero-order hold is the hypothetical [[filter (signal processing)|filter]] or [[LTI system]] that converts the sequence of modulated Dirac impulses ''x&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')to the piecewise-constant signal (shown in Figure 2):

:&lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{ZOH}}(t)\,= \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]\cdot \mathrm{rect} \left(\frac{t - nT}{T}-\frac{1}{2} \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;

resulting in an effective [[impulse response]] (shown in Figure 4) of:

: &lt;math&gt;h_{\mathrm{ZOH}}(t)\,=  \frac{1}{T} \mathrm{rect} \left(\frac{t}{T}-\frac{1}{2} \right)
 = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{T} &amp; \mbox{if } 0 \le t &lt; T  \\
0           &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases} \ &lt;/math&gt;

The effective frequency response is the [[continuous Fourier transform]] of the impulse response.

: &lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{ZOH}}(f)\, = \mathcal{F} \{ h_{\mathrm{ZOH}}(t) \} \,= \frac{1 - e^{-i 2 \pi fT}}{i 2 \pi fT} = e^{-i \pi fT} \mathrm{sinc}(fT) \ &lt;/math&gt;

: where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{sinc}(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is the (normalized) [[sinc function]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x}&lt;/math&gt; commonly used in digital signal processing.

The [[Laplace transform]] [[transfer function]] of the ZOH is found by substituting ''s'' = ''i'' 2 π ''f'':

: &lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{ZOH}}(s)\, = \mathcal{L} \{ h_{\mathrm{ZOH}}(t) \} \,= \frac{1 - e^{-sT}}{sT} \ &lt;/math&gt;

The fact that practical [[digital-to-analog converter]]s (DAC) do not output a sequence of [[dirac delta|dirac impulses]], ''x''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') (that, if ideally low-pass filtered, would result in the unique underlying bandlimited signal before sampling), but instead output a sequence of rectangular pulses, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;ZOH&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') (a [[piecewise constant]] function), means that there is an inherent effect of the ZOH on the effective frequency response of the DAC, resulting in a mild [[roll-off]] of gain at the higher frequencies (a 3.9224&amp;nbsp;dB loss at the [[Nyquist frequency]], corresponding to a gain of sinc(1/2) = 2/π). This drop is a consequence of the ''hold'' property of a conventional DAC, and is ''not'' due to the [[sample and hold]] that might precede a conventional [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC).

The '''zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture''', also known as a '''quadripod fracture''', '''quadramalar fracture''', and formerly referred to as a '''tripod fracture''' or '''trimalar fracture''', has four components: the lateral orbital wall (at either the [[zygomaticofrontal suture]] superiorly along the wall or [[zygomaticosphenoid suture]] inferiorly), separation of the maxilla and zygoma along the anterior maxilla (near the [[zygomaticomaxillary suture]]), the [[zygomatic arch]], and the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbital floor]] near the infraorbital canal.

==Signs and symptoms==
On physical exam, the fracture appears as a loss of cheek projection with increased width of the face. In most cases, there is loss of sensation in the cheek and upper lip due to infraorbital nerve injury. Facial bruising, periorbital ecchymosis, soft tissue gas, swelling, [[trismus]], altered [[mastication]], [[diplopia]], and  [[ophthalmoplegia]] are other indirect features of the injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fraioli|first1=RE|last2=Branstetter BF|first2=4th|last3=Deleyiannis|first3=FW|title=Facial fractures: beyond Le Fort.|journal=Otolaryngologic clinics of North America|date=February 2008|volume=41|issue=1|pages=51–76, vi|pmid=18261526|doi=10.1016/j.otc.2007.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zygomatic arch usually fractures at its weakest point, 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm behind the zygomaticotemporal suture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winegar|first1=BA|last2=Murillo|first2=H|last3=Tantiwongkosi|first3=B|title=Spectrum of critical imaging findings in complex facial skeletal trauma|journal=Radiographics|date=|volume=33|issue=1|pages=3–19|pmid=23322824|year=2013|doi=10.1148/rg.331125080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
The cause is usually a direct blow to the [[malar eminence]] of the cheek during assault. The paired [[zygoma]]s each have two attachments to the cranium, and two attachments to the [[maxilla]], making up the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbital floors and lateral walls]]. These complexes are referred to as the zygomaticomaxillary complex. The upper and transverse maxillary bone has the zygomaticomaxillary and zygomaticotemporal sutures, while the lateral and vertical maxillary bone has the zygomaticomaxillary and frontozygomatic sutures.

The formerly used 'tripod fracture' refers to these buttresses, but did not also incorporate the posterior relationship of the zygoma to the sphenoid bone at the zygomaticosphenoid suture.

There is an association of ZMC fractures with naso-orbito-ethmoidal fractures (NOE) on the same side as the injury. Concomitant NOE fractures predict a higher incidence of post operative deformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan|first1=EP|last2=Hopper|first2=RA|last3=Suver|first3=DW|last4=Hayes|first4=AG|last5=Gruss|first5=JS|last6=Birgfeld|first6=CB|title=Zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures and their association with naso-orbito-ethmoid fractures: a 5-year review.|journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery|date=December 2012|volume=130|issue=6|pages=1296–304|pmid=23190812|doi=10.1097/prs.0b013e31826d1643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment and prognosis==
Non-displaced or minimally displaced fractures may be treated conservatively. Open reduction and internal fixation is reserved for cases that are severely angulated or [[comminuted skull fracture|comminuted]]. The purpose of fixation is to restore the normal appearance of the face. Specific attention is given to the position of the [[malar eminence]] and reduction of [[orbit (anatomy)|orbital]] volume by realigning the zygoma and sphenoid. Failure to correct can result in rotational deformity and increase the volume of the orbit, causing the [[enophthalmos|eye to sink inwards]].

Fractures with displacement require surgery consisting of fracture reduction with miniplates, microplates and screws. Gillie's approach is used for depressed zygomatic fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swanson|first1=E|last2=Vercler|first2=C|last3=Yaremchuk|first3=MJ|last4=Gordon|first4=CR|title=Modified Gillies approach for zygomatic arch fracture reduction in the setting of bicoronal exposure.|journal=The Journal of craniofacial surgery|date=May 2012|volume=23|issue=3|pages=859–62|pmid=22565912|doi=10.1097/scs.0b013e31824dd5c3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prognosis of tripod fractures is generally good. In some cases there may be persistent post-surgical facial asymmetry, which can require further treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Linnau|first1=KF|last2=Stanley RB|first2=Jr|last3=Hallam|first3=DK|last4=Gross|first4=JA|last5=Mann|first5=FA|title=Imaging of high-energy midfacial trauma: what the surgeon needs to know.|journal=European journal of radiology|date=October 2003|volume=48|issue=1|pages=17–32|pmid=14511857|doi=10.1016/s0720-048x(03)00205-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:École de Physique des Houches (Les Houches Physics School) main lecture hall 1972.jpg|thumb|Summer, 1972, discussion in main lecture hall.  From left, [[Yuval Ne'eman]], [[Bryce DeWitt]], [[Kip Thorne]].]]
L’'''École de Physique des Houches''' (the Physics School of [[Les Houches]]) was founded in 1951 by a young French scientist, [[Cécile DeWitt-Morette]].

Historically the first lessons were given in 1951 by [[Léon van Hove]]  on quantum mechanics.  The conditions were very spartan with the lessons lasting eight weeks in alpine chalets devoid of all comforts, a few kilometers from the village of Les Houches.

Soon, the school rapidly attracted the greatest names of modern physics, such as [[Enrico Fermi]], [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[John Bardeen]] amongst others.  The young students, then unknown, included such future scientists as [[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes]], [[Georges Charpak]], and [[Claude Cohen-Tannoudji]], all future winners of the Nobel prize for Physics, as well as mathematician [[Alain Connes]], future winner of the Fields medal.
