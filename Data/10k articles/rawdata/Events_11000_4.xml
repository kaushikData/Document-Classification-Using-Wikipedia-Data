'''''14 - Diaries of the Great War''''' (titled ''Great War Diaries'' when aired on the [[BBC]]) is a 2014 international documentary drama series about [[World War I]]. It uses a mix of acted scenes, archive footage, and animation. All episodes were directed by [[Jan Peter]], series authors were Jan Peter and [[Yury Winterberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presseportal.de/pm/6694/2470168/-14-tagebuecher-des-ersten-weltkriegs-drehstart-zu-einzigartigem-filmprojekt-am-13-mai-im-elsass|title=Drehstart zu einzigartigem Filmprojekt am 13. Mai im Elsass|publisher=Pressemitteilung vom|date=13 May 2013|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a dramatic advisory capacity, Dutch producer and screenwriter [[Maarten van der Duin]] and BBC-author [[Andrew Bampfield]] worked on the film's development. The series is based on an idea by [[Gunnar Dedio]], producer at the film company LOOKS Leipzig and Ulrike Dotzer, the Head of Department [[Arte|ARTE]] at [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]].

== Story ==
The individual episodes of the series tell the story of the First World War, not from the perspective of politicians and the military; but from the perspective of soldiers, housewives, factory workers, nurses and children. In total there are 14 main characters. Meaningful scenes from their lives are re-enacted and intertwined. The result is not only a political or military history of the First World War, but a story that poignantly captures the feelings and moods of the people.

== Production ==

[[File:Peter Rehberg Kanada.jpeg|thumb|Director Jan Peter and cinematographer during production in Canada]]
The series was produced by LOOKSfilm Leipzig,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://looksfilm.tv/en/14-diaries-great-war |title=14 – Diaries of the Great War on the LOOKS website|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Les Films d’ici Paris und Filmoption International Montreal.

The scripts are based on quotes from [[diary|diaries]] and letters from men and women who experienced [[World War I]] in [[German Empire|Germany]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and the [[United States]], who wrote during the period from 1914 to 1918. More than 1,000 journals and collections of letters were examined and 14 moving stories of World War I were selected from this compilation. Overall, the selection of the diaries and subsequent development work took four years.

=== Archive footage ===
The series uses cinematic and photographic archive material from a total of 71 archives in 21 countries. Most material came from British [[Pathé]] (United Kingdom), [[Pathé|Gaumont Pathé]] (France), Krasnogorsk (Russia), [[Filmarchiv des Bundesarchivs|Bundesfilmarchiv]] (Germany),  Österreichisches Filmmuseum, the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (USA) and the [[Imperial War Museum]].

In the spring of 1915, the 22-year-old traveled with a ship full of volunteers who wanted to fight for their original homeland. In Europe, however, the fighting caused D'Aquila to have psychological issues.

Sweden's [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] had several additional segments produced for their airing of the series which included introductions to each episode by historian and author [[Peter Englund]] and dramatisations of diaries from six Swedes to tell the story of Sweden during the Great War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svt.se/det-stora-kriget/livet-under-forsta-varldskriget-gestaltas-i-stor-dokumentarsatsning |title=Stor dokumentärsatsning om livet under första världskriget |publisher=SVT.se |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RL4ftaL1?url=http://www.svt.se/det-stora-kriget/livet-under-forsta-varldskriget-gestaltas-i-stor-dokumentarsatsning |archivedate=25 July 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were edited into the original eight episodes which meant they ended up with a running time of sixty minutes. This version of the series premièred on [[SVT1]] on 26 June.

| ShortSummary    = In the records of the young Cossack Marina Yurlova, the Austrian farmer Karl Kasser and the children Yves Congar and Elfriede Kuhr, who are experiencing the outbreak of war at home, there is little room for jubilant patriotism. The episode describes how everyday life collapsed with the beginning of the war, together with the inflammatory speeches of a teacher and the heroic portrayals of the first days of the war.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===

The series received very positive reviews. [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] called it "Gripping, emotional, and real. A milestone for European television.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Lorenz | last=Jäger | title=Weltkriegsgedenken auf Arte - Jede Szene findet eine Parallele beim Feind | work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung | url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/medien/weltkriegsgedenken-auf-arte-jede-szene-findet-eine-parallele-beim-feind-12914544.html | date=29 April 2014 | accessdate=30 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] describes the series as "A story of the destruction and the future of television.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Claudia | last=Tieschky | title=Requiem | work=Süddeutsche Zeitung |date=2014-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stuttgarter Zeitung]] calls it "Woven together like a modern television series.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ulla | last=Hanselmann | title=Mit emotionaler Wucht in die Vergangenheit |work=Stuttgarter Zeitung | date=29 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]] says that "the program manages to fascinate by combining different observations, in different locations, and managing to condense these into a coherent mood.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Claudia | last=Schwartz | title=Sag zum Abschied nicht Adieu | work=Neue Zürcher Zeitung |date=2014-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Le Monde]] ascribes to the series "a never before seen virtuosity",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Philippe-Jean | last=Catinchi | title=Correspondances de guerre | work=Le Monde | date=27 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Direct Matin calls it "of exceptional quality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=La guerre de l'intérieur | work=Direct Matin | date=29 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch version of the series was described as follows by [[NRC Handelsblad]]: "Phantastic Television Making… We ride a rollercoaster of emotions, as if we are not supposed to understand history but rather to live it ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Hans | last=Beerekamp | title=Beleef de Grote Oorlog met Marina en Käthe | work=NRC Handelsblad | date=14 April 2014 | url=http://www.nrc.nl/handelsblad/van/2014/april/14/beleef-de-grote-oorlog-met-marina-en-kathe-1367467 | accessdate=14 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After watching the series on [[Netflix]], [[William F.B. O'Reilly]] called the series "superbly done" and said "unlike other Netflix programming that escapes the mind moments after consumption, "14" lingers. It consumes its viewers rather than the other way around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=William | last=O'Reilly | title=War-weary Europe is putty to Putin | publisher=[[Newsday]] | url=http://www.newsday.com/opinion/columnists/william-f-b-o-reilly/war-weary-europe-is-putty-to-putin-william-f-b-o-reilly-1.9935420 | date=13 February 2015 | accessdate=26 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program ==

=== Sustainability ===
The Sustainability Treehouse is a living education center for visitors to the Summit Bechtel Reserve, not only providing information, but also immersing visitors in the concept of sustainability. Between the local timber used to build the structure, the rainwater recovery system, and the wind and solar generated energy, stream restoration, recycling and geothermal heat are just a few examples of the additional sustainability efforts practiced at the Summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.2019wsj.org/the-event/why-2019-wsj/ |title=Why 24th WSJ? |publisher=2019wsj.org |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615164633/https://www.2019wsj.org/the-event/why-2019-wsj/ |archivedate=15 June 2018 |accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--==Classification==--&gt;
&lt;!-- ==Signs and symptoms== --&gt;

==Causes==
Causes can include [[aortic dissection]], [[intramural hematoma]], [[penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer]] or a [[thoracic aneurysm]] that has become unstable.&lt;ref name="pmid18236724"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith AD, Schoenhagen P |title=CT imaging for acute aortic syndrome |journal=Cleve Clin J Med |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=7–9, 12, 15–7 passim |date=January 2008 |pmid=18236724 |doi= 10.3949/ccjm.75.1.7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The potential causes of AAS are life-threatening and present with similar symptoms, making it difficult to distinguish the ultimate cause, though high resolution, high contrast [[computerised tomography]] can be used.&lt;ref name="pmid18236724"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17612751"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marijon E, Vilanculos A, Tivane A |title=Thoracic aortic aneurysm: direct sign of rupture |journal=Cardiovasc J Afr |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=180–1 |year=2007 |pmid=17612751 |doi= | format = pdf |url=http://blues.sabinet.co.za/WebZ/Authorize?sessionid=0:autho=pubmed:password=pubmed2004&amp;/AdvancedQuery?&amp;format=F&amp;next=images/ejour/cardio/cardio_v18_n3_a10.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
The condition can be mimicked by a ruptured [[cyst]] of the [[pericardium]],&lt;ref name="pmid18296680"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nishigami K, Hirayama T, Kamio T |title=Pericardial cyst rupture mimicking acute aortic syndrome |journal=Eur.

Misdiagnosis is estimated at 39% and is associated with delays correct diagnosis and improper treatment with [[anticoagulant]]s producing excessive bleeding and extended hospital stays.&lt;ref name="pmid17350381"/&gt;

==Management==

AAS is life-threatening, with a high [[mortality rate]] if appearing [[Acute (medicine)|acutely]], reduced only when diagnosed early and treated by a [[Surgery|surgeon]] with considerable expertise.&lt;ref name="pmid17521551"/&gt; If patients survive acute presentation, within three to five years 30% will develop [[complication (medicine)|complications]] and require close follow-up.&lt;ref name="pmid17521551"/&gt;  Early diagnosis is essential for survival and management is challenging though greater awareness of the syndrome and improving management strategies are improving patient outcomes.&lt;ref name="pmid17535765"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ince H, Nienaber CA |title=[Management of acute aortic syndromes] |language=Spanish |journal=Rev Esp Cardiol |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=526–41 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17535765 |doi=10.1016/S1885-5857(07)60194-7 |url=http://www.revespcardiol.org/cgi-bin/wdbcgi.exe/cardio/mrevista_cardio.pubmed_full?inctrl=05ZI0113&amp;vol=60&amp;num=5&amp;pag=526 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrei Alekseevich Amalrik''' ({{lang-ru|Андре́й Алексе́евич Ама́льрик}}, 12 May 1938, [[Moscow]] – 12 November 1980, [[Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha]], [[Spain]]), alternatively spelled ''Andrei'' or ''Andrey'', was a [[Soviet Union|Russian]] writer and dissident.

Amalrik was best known in the Western world for his essay, ''Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?''

==Early life==

Amalrik was born in Moscow, during the time of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s purges.

When the Soviet revolution broke out, Andrei's father, then a young man, volunteered for the [[Red Army]]. After the war he went into the film industry. Andrei's father fought in [[World War II]] in the [[Northern Fleet]] and then the Red Army.  He was overheard uttering negative views about Stalin's qualities as a military leader, which led to his arrest and imprisonment; he feared for his life, but shortly afterward was released to rejoin the army. In 1942 he was wounded at [[Stalingrad]] and invalided out of the service.  Andrei's father's hardships explain Andrei's decision to become a historian. For his father, after climbing the educational ladder, was after the war refused permission to study at the Academy of Sciences' Institute of History on account of what authorities felt was his own compromised political past.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} But as historian John Keep wrote: "Andrei has gone one better by not only writing history but by securing a place in it."&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite journal

Andrei's father developed a serious heart condition which required constant nursing. This care was provided first by his wife, and on her death from cancer in 1959 by his son Andrei, until Andrei's arrest prevented him from ministering to his father's needs. He died when Andrei was in prison.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;

In high school, Andrei Amalrik was a restless student and truant.  He was expelled a year before graduation. Despite this, he won admission to the history department at [[Moscow State University]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt;

In 1963, he angered the university with a dissertation suggesting that Scandinavian warrior-traders (Vikings, usually called Varangians in Russia)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Varangians|date=2018-07-12|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Varangians&amp;oldid=849875284|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Greeks, rather than Slavs, played the principal role in developing the early Russian state in the ninth century. Amalrik refused to modify his views and was expelled from [[Moscow University]].&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First prison sentence==
Without a degree, Amalrik did odd jobs and wrote five unpublished plays but was soon under the gaze of the security police for an attempt to contact a Danish scholar through the Danish Embassy.&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt; He also became close to the unofficial youth literary group [[SMOG (literary group)|SMOG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Thaw Generation: Coming of Age in the Post-Stalin Era|last=Alexeyeva|first=Lyudmila|date=1993|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-5911-3|location=Pittsburgh, PA|pages=166|author-link=Lyudmila Alexeyeva}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amalrik's plays and an interest in modern non-representational art led to Amalrik's first arrest in May 1965. A charge of spreading pornography failed because the expert witnesses called by the prosecution refused to give the correct testimony. However, the authorities then accused Amalrik of "parasitism," and he was sentenced by an administrative tribunal to banishment in western Siberia for a two-and-a-half-year term.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;

He was freed briefly and then rearrested and sent to exile in a farm village near [[Tomsk]], in [[Siberia]]. Allowed to make a brief trip to Moscow after the death of his father, Amalrik persuaded [[Tatar]] expressionist artist, Gyuzel Makudinova, to marry him and share his exile.&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UPI"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was this exile he described in ''Involuntary Journey to Siberia'' (1970). Thanks to the efforts of his lawyer, his sentence was overturned in 1966 and Amalrik returned to Moscow, moving with Gyuzel into a crowded communal apartment with one bath, one kitchen, and one telephone.&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;

==Protest at trial==
During [[Sinyavsky–Daniel trial|the trial]] of writers [[Andrei Sinyavsky]] and [[Yuli Daniel]] in February 1966, Amalrik and other dissenters stood outside of the trial to protest.&lt;ref name="fall"&gt;{{cite book

Amalrik often met with foreign correspondents to relay protests, took part in vigils outside courthouses and even gave an interview to an American television reporter.&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt;

After the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968, pressure on Russia's intellectuals was stepped up by the authorities. Amalrik's apartment was twice searched, in May 1969 and February 1970.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;

==Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?==

Amalrik was best known in the Western world for his essay ''Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?'', published in 1970. The book predicts the country's eventual breakup under the weight of social and ethnic antagonisms and a disastrous war with China.

Writing in 1969, Amalrik originally wanted to make 1980 as the date of the Soviet downfall, because 1980 was a round number, but Amalrik was persuaded by a friend to change it to the [[George Orwell|Orwellian]] inspired year of [[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]].&lt;ref name="dream"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amalrik predicted the collapse of the regime would occur between 1980 and 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Cahn, Anne H. | title=Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA | publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |date=September 1998 | isbn=0-271-01791-0}} [http://www.livejournal.com/users/bailey83221/48481.html 3 Reviews]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amalrik said in his book:

{{quote|text=I must emphasize that my essay is based not on scholarly research but only on observation. From an academic point of view, it may appear to be only empty chatter. But for Western students of the Soviet Union, at any rate, this discussion should have the same interest that a fish would have for an [[ichthyologist]] if it suddenly began to talk.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book

Amalrik was incorrect in some of his predictions, such as a coming military collision with China, and the collapse of the Soviet Union occurred in 1991, not 1984. He also failed to predict that he himself would not survive 1980.&lt;ref name="dream" /&gt; Correct was his argument that:

{{quote|text=If...one views the present "liberalization" as the growing decrepitude of the regime rather than its regeneration, then the logical result will be its death, which will be followed by anarchy."&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;}}

Amalrik predicted that when the breakup of the Soviet empire came, it would take one of two forms. Either power would pass to extremist elements and the country would "disintegrate into anarchy, violence, and intense national hatred," or the end would come peacefully and lead to a federation like the British Commonwealth or the European Common Market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As 1984 drew nearer, Amalrik revised the timetable but still predicted that the Soviet Union would eventually collapse.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

===US reaction===
Predictions of the Soviet Union's impending demise were discounted by many, if not most, Western academic specialists,&lt;ref name="melt"&gt;{{cite journal

===Soviet reaction===
[[Soviet dissidents|Soviet dissident]] [[Natan Sharansky]] described that "in 1984 KGB officials, on coming to me in prison" when Amalrik's essay was mentioned, "laughed at this prediction. 'Amalrik is long dead', they said, 'but we are still very much present.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-USSR views===
Of those few who foresaw the fall of the Soviet Union, including Andrei Amalrik, author [[Walter Laqueur]] argued in 1995 that they were largely accidental prophets, possessors of both brilliant insight into the regime's weaknesses and even more brilliant luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Second prison sentence==
For several months after the publication of ''Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?'' (1970) and ''Involuntary Journey to Siberia'' (August 1970), abroad, a criminal offence under Soviet law, Amalrik remained free to walk the streets of Moscow and to associate with foreigners.

Inevitably, for "defaming the Soviet state", Amalrik was arrested in November 1970&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; and sentenced to three years in a labor camp in [[Kolyma]].  At the end of his term, he was given three more years, but because of his poor health (he almost died of [[meningitis]]) and protests from the West, the sentence was commuted after one year to exile in the same region. After serving a five-year term, he returned to Moscow in 1975. Although they were not Jewish, the authorities tried to persuade Amalrik and his wife to apply for visas to Israel, the common channel for emigration from the Soviet Union; they refused. On September 13, 1975, Amalrik was arrested again.  The police captain told his wife that he was arrested for not having permission to live in Moscow; he could have faced a fine or up to 1 year in prison for violating Soviet passport regulations.&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT3"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1976 Amalrik and other dissidents conceived idea of the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]]; it was formed in May 1976.

==Exile==
[[File:Andrei Amalrik with wife 1976b.jpg|thumb|300px|Andrei Amalrik with his wife, artist Gyuzel Makudinova, at a press conference in the Netherlands, 1976]]
The KGB gave Amalrik an ultimatum: to emigrate or face another sentence. In 1976 his family got visas to go to the [[Netherlands]]. He made a farewell tour of Russia before emigrating.&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

Amalrik worked in the Netherlands at the [[Utrecht University]], then moved to the United States to study and lecture. Later, he and Gyuzel bought a villa in France, near the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] border, where he worked on his book, ''Notebooks of a Revolutionary.''&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt;

He scorned détente with the Soviet Union. He urged that Western trade and technology be linked to liberalization within the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt;

==Death==
On November 12, 1980, Amalrik, his wife, and two other Soviet exiles, [[Vladimir Borisov]] and [[Viktor Fainberg]], were on their way to [[Madrid]] to attend an East-West conference called to review the [[Helsinki Accords]] of 1975. "Spanish police stated that Amalrik, coming from southern France, swerved out of his lane on a wet road near the city of [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]] and his car struck an oncoming truck. Mr. Amalrik was instantly killed by a piece of metal, probably from the steering column, which was embedded in his throat, according to the police. His widow, Gyuzel, received only slight injuries," as did the two other passengers.&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

*In Russian history, man has always been a means but never an end&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Quotes from ''Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?''===
*"There is another powerful factor which works against the chance of any kind of peaceful reconstruction and which is equally negative for all levels of society: this is the extreme isolation in which the regime has placed both society and itself. This isolation has not only separated the regime from society, and all sectors of society from each other, but also put the country in extreme isolation from the rest of the world. This isolation has created for all—from the bureaucratic elite to the lowest social levels—an almost surrealistic picture of the world and of their place in it. Yet the longer this state of affairs helps to perpetuate the status quo, the more rapid and decisive will be its collapse when confrontation with reality becomes inevitable."
*"...any state forced to devote so much of its energies to physically and psychologically controlling millions of its own subjects could not survive indefinitely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Quote from "Notes of a Revolutionary"===
*"We had left a great country that we both loved and hated. Could it really be that we would never return?"&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;
*"Even when examining the subject most critically, I do not regard the Russians as a hopeless people, for whom slavery is a natural mode of existence. ... I can see that in the authoritarian stream of Russian history there is an undercurrent, sometimes strong, of a sense of law."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;
* Before being exiled, Amalrik made a pilgrimage to those places where, in the 14th century, [[Muscovy]] was born. Standing before an amazing complex of wooden churches of [[Kizhi Pogost]] on the banks of [[Lake Onega]], he felt a stab of wonderment: "How could one and the same people have created such churches and destroyed so many of them in blind rage?"&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The executive producers were [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Tom Hanks]], who had collaborated on the 1998 World War II film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]''.&lt;ref name="BBCDrama"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/bandofbrothers/ "Drama: Band of Brothers"]. [[BBC|BBC.co.uk]]. Retrieved: 2008-06-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The episodes first aired in 2001 on [[HBO]]. The series won [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe]] awards in 2001 for best miniseries.

The series dramatizes the history of [[E Company, 506th Infantry Regiment (United States)|"Easy" Company]], 2nd Battalion, [[506th Infantry Regiment (United States)|506th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], of the [[101st Airborne Division]], from jump training in the United States through its participation in [[European theatre of World War II|major actions in Europe]], up until Japan's capitulation and the war's end. The events are based on Ambrose's research and recorded interviews with Easy Company veterans. The series took [[Artistic license|literary license]], adapting history for dramatic effect and series structure.&lt;ref&gt;''Biggest Brother: The Life of Dick Winters''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.101airborneww2.com/bandofbrothers.html |title=Trigger Time by 101st historian Mark Bando has a detailed discussion of the miniseries's historical accuracy |publisher=101airborneww2.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters portrayed are based on members of Easy Company. Some of the men were recorded in contemporary interviews, which viewers see as preludes to each episode, with the men's real identities revealed in the finale.

The title for the book and series comes from the [[St Crispin's Day Speech]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', delivered by [[Henry V of England|King Henry]] before the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. Ambrose quotes a passage from the speech on his book's first page; this passage is spoken by [[Carwood Lipton]] in the series finale.

==Plot==
''Band of Brothers'' is a dramatized account of [[E Company, 506th Infantry Regiment (United States)|"Easy Company"]] (part of the 2nd [[Battalion]], [[506th Infantry Regiment (United States)|506th Parachute Infantry Regiment]]), assigned to the [[United States Army]]'s [[101st Airborne Division]] during World War II. Over ten episodes the series details the company's exploits during the war. Starting with jump training at [[Camp Toccoa]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], ''Band of Brothers'' follows the unit through the [[American airborne landings in Normandy]], [[Operation Market Garden]], the [[Siege of Bastogne]], and on to the war's end. It includes the taking of the ''[[Kehlsteinhaus]]'' (Eagle's Nest) at Obersalzberg in Berchtesgaden and refers to the surrender of Japan. [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Richard Winters]] (1918–2011) is the central character, shown working to accomplish the company's missions and keep his men together and safe. While the series features a large ensemble cast, each episode generally focuses on a single character, following his action.&lt;ref name="BBCDrama"/&gt;

As the series is based on historic events, the fates of the characters reflect those of the persons on which they are based.  Many either die or sustain serious wounds which lead to their being sent home.  Other soldiers recover after treatment in field hospitals and rejoin their units on the front line. Their experiences, and the moral, mental, and physical hurdles they must overcome, are central to the narrative.

==Production==
The series was developed chiefly by [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Erik Jendresen]], who spent months detailing the plot outline and individual episodes.&lt;ref name="TV Notes"&gt;{{cite news | title=TV Notes ; World War II, The Mini-Series | first=Lawrie | last=Mifflin | work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Spielberg]] served as "the final eye" and used ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', the film on which he and Hanks had collaborated, to inform the series.&lt;ref name="Private Ryan"&gt;{{cite news|title = Television/Radio ; Learning How the Private Ryans Felt and Fought | first=Kristin | last=Hohenadel | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=2000-12-17 | accessdate = 2008-08-24|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/17/arts/television-radio-learning-how-the-private-ryans-felt-and-fought.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts of Easy Company veterans, such as [[Donald Malarkey]], were incorporated into production to add historic detail.&lt;ref name="Private Ryan" /&gt;

An additional $15 million was allocated for a promotional campaign, which included screenings for World War II veterans.&lt;ref name = "Pentagon" /&gt; One was held at [[Utah Beach]], Normandy, where U.S. troops had landed on June 6, 1944. On June 7, 2001, 47 Easy Company veterans were flown to Paris and then travelled by chartered train to the site, where the series premiered.&lt;ref name="Cable"&gt;{{cite news|title=HBO Cable network sets itself apart with daring fare|first=Gary|last=Levin|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2001-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arts Abroad"&gt;{{cite news| title=Arts Abroad ; A Normandy Landing, This One for a Film|first=Alan|last=Riding|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2001-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also sponsoring was [[Chrysler]], as its [[Jeep]]s were used in the series.&lt;ref name="Jeep"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Media Business: Advertising ; Jeep's manufacturer seeks to capitalize on the vehicle's featured role in 'Band of Brothers.'|first= Stuart|last=Elliott|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2001-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler spent $5 million to $15 million on its advertising campaign, using footage from ''Band of Brothers''.&lt;ref name="Jeep" /&gt; Each of the spots was reviewed and approved by the co-executive producers Hanks and Spielberg.&lt;ref name="Jeep"/&gt;

The [[BBC]] paid £7 million ($10.1 million) as co-production partner, the most it had ever paid for a bought-in program, and screened it on [[BBC Two]]. Originally, it was to have aired on [[BBC One]] but was moved to allow an "uninterrupted ten-week run", with the BBC denying that this was because the series was not sufficiently mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1492257.stm|work= BBC News|title= Spielberg epic loses prime slot|date= August 15, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200110080038 |title=The true drama of war|work=[[New Statesman]]|date= October 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations were monitored by British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], who spoke personally to Spielberg.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC pays Pounds 15m for new Spielberg war epic|first=Nicholas|last=Hellen|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=2001-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location===
The series was shot over eight to 10 months at [[Hatfield Aerodrome]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England. Various sets, including replicas of European towns, were built.&lt;ref name="Arts Abroad" /&gt; This location had also been used to shoot the film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]''.&lt;ref name="Private Ryan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brothers" /&gt; Replicas were constructed on the large open field to represent 12 different towns, among them [[Bastogne]], Belgium; [[Eindhoven]], Netherlands; and [[Carentan]], France.&lt;ref name="Hatfield"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hatfield prepares for invasion of Spielberg brigade|first=Clare|last=Garner|work=[[The Independent]]|date=1999-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[North Weald Airfield]] in [[Essex]] was also used for location shots depicting the take-off sequences before the [[D-Day]] [[Normandy]] landings.

The village of [[Hambleden]], in [[Buckinghamshire]], England, was used as a location extensively in the early episodes to depict the company's training in England, as well as in later scenes. The scenes set in Germany and Austria were shot in Switzerland, in and near the village of [[Brienz]] in the [[Bernese Oberland]], and at the nearby Hotel Giessbach.

===Historical accuracy===
To preserve historical accuracy, the writers conducted additional research. One source was the memoir of Easy Company soldier [[David Kenyon Webster]],  ''Parachute Infantry: An American Paratrooper's Memoir of D-Day and the Fall of the Third Reich'' (1994).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} This was published by [[LSU Press]], following renewed interest in World War II and almost 40 years after his death in a boating accident. In ''Band of Brothers'' Ambrose quoted liberally from Webster's unpublished diary entries, with permission from his estate.&lt;ref name=BofB_Book/&gt;{{efn|Keynon is referenced 18 times in the index, and appears on 69 pages.}}

The production team consulted [[Dale Dye]], a retired [[United States Marine Corps]] Captain and consultant on ''Saving Private Ryan'', as well as with most of the surviving Company veterans, including Richard Winters, Bill Guarnere, Frank Perconte, Ed Heffron, and Amos Taylor.&lt;ref name="Private Ryan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vets"&gt;{{cite news | title=Actors &amp; Vets Bond In 'Band Of Brothers' |first=Richard|last=Huff |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |location=New York |date=2001-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dye (who portrays Colonel [[Robert Sink]]) instructed the actors in a 10-day [[Recruit training|boot camp]].&lt;ref name="Vets" /&gt;

The production aimed for accuracy in the detail of weapons and costumes. Simon Atherton, the weapons master, corresponded with veterans to match weapons to scenes, and assistant costume designer Joe Hobbs used photos and veteran accounts.&lt;ref name="Private Ryan" /&gt;

Most actors had contact before filming with the individuals they were to portray, often by telephone. Several veterans came to the production site.&lt;ref name="Private Ryan" /&gt; Hanks acknowledged that alterations were needed to create the series: "We've made history fit onto our screens. We had to condense down a vast number of characters, fold other people's experiences into 10 or 15 people, have people saying and doing things others said or did. We had people take off their helmets to identify them, when they would never have done so in combat. But I still think it is three or four times more accurate than most films like this."&lt;ref name="Arts Abroad" /&gt; As a final accuracy check, the veterans saw previews of the series and approved the episodes before they were aired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miniseries put actors through boot camp|first=Sandy|last=MacDonald|work=[[The Daily News (Halifax)|Daily News]]|location=Halifax|date=2002-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberation of one of the [[Kaufering concentration camp|Kaufering subcamps]] of [[Dachau]] was depicted in episode 9 ("[[Why We Fight (Band of Brothers)|Why We Fight]]"); however, the 101st Airborne Division arrived at Kaufering Lager IV subcamp on the day after&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10006152|title = The 101st Airborne Division|website = The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate = 2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was discovered by the 134th Ordnance Maintenance Battalion of the [[12th Armored Division (United States)|12th Armored Division]], on 27 April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 12th Armored Division|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10006170|website=The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 12th Armored Division Memorial Museum:Liberation of Concentration Camps|url=http://www.12tharmoredmuseum.com/liberation.asp|website=The 12th Armored Division Memorial Museum|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the film in the year 2000 a collaboration of [[Anton Posset]] with the film crew of [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Tom Hanks]] took place. [[Anton Posset]] gave the historical consultancy through photographs of the American/French liberators and the documentation of the survivor's reports he had collected over the years. The camp was reconstructed in England for the mini-series.&lt;ref&gt;http://buergervereinigung-landsberg.de/geschichte/orginalfilm.htm The American army discovered the Holocaust (original film from Kaufering IV) and Band of Brothers – Citizens´ Association "Landsberg in the 20th Century".

It is uncertain which Allied unit was first to reach the ''[[Kehlsteinhaus]]''; several claim the honor, compounded by confusion with the town of Berchtesgaden, which was taken on May 4 by forward elements of the [[7th Infantry Regiment (United States)|7th Infantry Regiment]] of the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]].&lt;ref name=historynet&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-race-to-seize-berchtesgaden.htm World War II: Race to Seize Berchtesgaden] HistoryNet 12 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Army in World War II, Special Studies, Chronology 1941-1945 [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-SS-Chronology/USA-SS-Chronology-5.html] "In U.S. Seventh Army's XV Corps area, 7th Inf of 3d Div, crossing into Austria, advances through Salzburg to Berchtesgaden without opposition".&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|According to [[Dwight D.

Since ''Band of Brothers'' focuses entirely on the exploits of "E" (Easy) Company during World War II, the series features a large ensemble cast.

 |ShortSummary = Easy Company is introduced during its training at Camp Toccoa, Georgia, under First Lieutenant/Captain Herbert Sobel, a very strict disciplinarian who seems to train his company harder and longer than the commanders of other companies. Sobel also goes out of his way to find fault with the men and the platoon leaders. The company is shipped to [[England]] to prepare for D-Day.  As training progresses, Sobel's inadequacies as a leader in the field become more apparent and cause most of the non-commissioned officers in the company to attempt to resign en masse. He also causes a dispute with his executive officer, Richard Winters, that escalates higher than Sobel expected. These events lead to Sobel being reassigned to command a jump school for essential non-combat personnel.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
''Band of Brothers'' received critical acclaim, mixed with doubts about the handling of individual characters.

[[CNN]]'s Paul Clinton said that the miniseries "is a remarkable testament to that generation of citizen soldiers, who responded when called upon to save the world for democracy and then quietly returned to build the nation that we now all enjoy, and all too often take for granted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/07/band.brothers/index.html?related CNN, Enlist TV for 'Band of Brothers' September 7, 2001 Posted: 11:55 AM EDT (1555 GMT)]&lt;/ref&gt; Caryn James of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it "an extraordinary 10-part series that masters its greatest challenge: it balances the ideal of heroism with the violence and terror of battle, reflecting what is both civilized and savage about war." James also remarked on the generation gap between most viewers and characters, suggesting this was a significant hurdle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Caryn | last=James | title=TV Weekend; An Intricate Tapestry Of a Heroic Age | publisher=''The New York Times'' | date=2001-09-07 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/07/movies/tv-weekend-an-intricate-tapestry-of-a-heroic-age.html | accessdate=2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote that the series was "significantly flawed and yet absolutely extraordinary—just like the men it portrays," rating the series four out of four stars. He noted however that it was hard to identify with individual characters during crowded battle scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Robert | last=Bianco | title='Band' masterfully depicts horror, complexity of war | publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' | date=2001-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip French]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that he had "seen nothing in the cinema this past year that impressed me as much as BBC2's 10-part Band of Brothers, produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, and [[Ken Loach]]'s The Navigators on Channel 4", and that it was "one of the best films ever made about men in war and superior in most ways to Saving Private Ryan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=French |first1=Philip |title=Diamonds in the dross: Films of the year  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/dec/23/features.review|accessdate=9 October 2014|work=The Guardian |date=23 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Seaton, also in ''The Guardian'', wrote that the film's production was "on such a scale that in an ad hoc, inadvertent way it gives one a powerful sense of what really was accomplished during the D-Day invasion - the extraordinary logistical effort of moving men and matériel in vast quantities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Seaton |first1=Matt |title=Too close for comfort |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/sep/24/features.mattseaton |accessdate=9 October 2014 |work=The Guardian |date=24 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Shales]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that though the series is "at times visually astonishing," it suffers from "disorganization, muddled thinking and a sense of redundancy." Shales observed that the characters are hard to identify: "Few of the characters stand out strikingly against the backdrop of the war. In fact, this show is all backdrop and no frontdrop. When you watch two hours and still aren't quite sure who the main characters are, something is wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Tom | last=Shales | title='Band of Brothers': Ragged WWII Saga Off to a Slow March | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date=2001-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Band of Brothers'' has become a benchmark for World War II series. The German series ''[[Generation War]],'' for example, was characterized by critics as ''Band of Brüder'' (the German word for "Brothers").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/band-of-br%C3%BCder-a-german-view-of-wartime-1.1343285 |title=Band of Brüder: a German view of wartime|accessdate = July 8, 2013 | work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratings===
The premiere of ''Band of Brothers'' on September 9, 2001, drew 10 million viewers.&lt;ref name="9/11"&gt;{{cite news|first=Rick|last= Lyman|title=Fewer Soldiers March Onscreen; After Attacks, Filmmakers Weigh Wisdom of Military Stories|work=[[The New York Times]]| date=2001-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, the [[September 11 attacks]] occurred, and HBO immediately ceased its marketing campaign.&lt;ref name="9/11" /&gt; The second episode drew 7.2 million viewers.&lt;ref name="9/11" /&gt; The last episode of the miniseries received 5.1 million viewers, the smallest audience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1005087812651291880 HBO's 'Band of Brothers' Draws Series' Smallest Audience for Finale ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis began when a group of armed [[Islamic terrorists|Islamic militants]], mostly [[Ingush people|Ingush]] and [[Chechen people|Chechen]], occupied School Number One (SNO) in the town of [[Beslan]], [[North Ossetia–Alania|North Ossetia]] (an [[autonomous republic]] in the [[North Caucasus]] region of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]]) on 1 September 2004. The hostage-takers were the [[Riyad-us Saliheen Brigade of Martyrs|Riyad-us Saliheen]], sent by the Chechen warlord [[Shamil Basayev]], who demanded recognition of the independence of [[Chechnya]], and Russian withdrawal from Chechnya. On the third day of the standoff, Russian security forces stormed the building with the use of [[tank]]s, [[RPO-A Shmel (Bumblebee)|incendiary rockets]] and other heavy weapons.&lt;ref name="Satter"&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/907jbmkm.asp?pg=1 The Truth About Beslan.

The event led to security and political repercussions in Russia; most notably, it contributed to a series of federal government reforms consolidating power in the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] and strengthening of the powers of the [[President of Russia]].&lt;ref name="shadow" /&gt; As of 2016, aspects of the crisis in relation to the [[Insurgent|militants]] continue to be contentious: questions remain regarding how many terrorists were involved, the nature of their preparations and whether a section of the group had escaped.

The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) in a 2017 ruling criticised Russia for not taking sufficient precautions before the event, and for using excessive lethal force when concluding the siege which violated the "right to life".&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite

==Background==
[[File:RussiaNorthOssetia-Highlight.png|thumb|[[North Ossetia–Alania]] on a map of Russia]]

School № 1 was one of seven schools in Beslan, a town of around 35,000 people in the republic of [[North Ossetia–Alania]], in Russia's [[Caucasus]]. The school, located next to the district police station, had around 60 teachers and more than 800 students.&lt;ref name="insurgents"/&gt; Its gymnasium, where most of the hostages were held for 52 hours, was a recent addition, measuring 10 metres wide and 25 metres long.&lt;ref name="hell"/&gt; There were reports that men disguised as repairmen had concealed weapons and explosives in the school sometime during July 2004, something the authorities later denied. However, several witnesses have since testified they were made to help their captors remove the weapons from the caches hidden in the school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews&amp;#91;tt_news&amp;#93;=30567&amp;tx_ttnews&amp;#91;backPid&amp;#93;=195&amp;no_cache=1 Kulaev trial further erodes official version of Beslan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929131328/http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews&amp; |date=29 September 2013 }}, [[The Jamestown Foundation]], 22 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raw"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5302448.stm Beslan still a raw nerve for Russia], [[BBC News]], 1 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also claims that a "sniper's nest" on the sports hall roof had been set up in advance.&lt;ref name="counter"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081228051450/http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7575 The 2002 Dubrovka and 2004 Beslan Hostage Crises: A Critique of Russian Counter-Terrorism], ''[[Prospect Magazine]]'', July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack on the school took place in 2004 on 1 September—the traditional start of the Russian school year, referred to as "First Bell" or [[Knowledge Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacecorps.gov/wws/stories/stories.cfm?psid=166&amp;sid=2 |title=Mr. John and the Day of Knowledge |publisher=[[Peace Corps]] |accessdate=27 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003160656/http://www.peacecorps.gov/wws/stories/stories.cfm?psid=166&amp;sid=2 |archivedate=3 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On this day, the children, accompanied by their parents and other relatives, attend ceremonies hosted by their school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://petersburgcity.com/city/photos/holidays/1september/ St. Petersburg in Pictures: The First of September – the Day of Knowledge], City of [[St. Petersburg]]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the Knowledge Day festivities, the number of people in the schools was considerably higher than on a normal school day. Early in the morning, a group of several dozen heavily armed Islamic-nationalist guerrillas left a forest encampment located in the vicinity of the village of Psedakh in the neighbouring republic of [[Ingushetia]], east of North Ossetia and west of war-torn Chechnya. The terrorists wore green military camouflage and black [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]] masks, and in some cases were also wearing explosive belts and explosive underwear. On the way to Beslan, on a country road near the North Ossetian village of Khurikau, they captured an Ingush police officer, Major Sultan Gurazhev.&lt;ref name="doubt"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120910131207/http://www.jamestown.org/programs/nca/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D%3D2032%26tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D%3D186%26no_cache%3D1#91;tt_news&amp;#93;=2032&amp;tx_ttnews&amp;#91;backPid&amp;#93;=186&amp;no_cache=1 Officials evade responsibility as death toll remains in doubt], [[The Jamestown Foundation]], 6 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Gurazhev escaped after reaching the town{{clarify|date=April 2012}}&lt;!--Beslan or Khurikau?--&gt; and went to the district police department to inform them that his duty handgun and badge were taken away.&lt;ref name="warnings"&gt;[http://www.kommersant.com/p502645/r_1/Storm_Warnings/ Storm Warnings // Relatives of the Hostages Swear They Won’t Let the Special Forces into the School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103061443/http://www.kommersant.com/p502645/r_1/Storm_Warnings/ |date=3 January 2009 }}, ''[[Kommersant]]'', 3 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 09:11 local time, the terrorists arrived at Beslan in a [[GAZelle]] police van and a [[GAZ-66]] military truck. Many witnesses and independent experts claim that there were, in fact, two groups of attackers, and that the first group was already at the school when the second group arrived by truck.&lt;ref name="our"/&gt; At first, some at the school mistook the guerrillas for Russian special forces practicing a security drill.&lt;ref name="one_little_boy"&gt;{{cite news|date=5 September 2004 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/05/wosse105.xml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721081627/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2004%2F09%2F05%2Fwosse105.xml |archivedate=21 July 2006 |title=One little boy was shouting: 'Mama!'

After gathering the hostages in the gym, the attackers singled out 15–20 of whom they thought were the strongest adults among the male teachers, school employees, and fathers, and took them into a corridor next to the cafeteria on the second floor, where a deadly blast soon took place. An explosive belt on one of the female bombers detonated, killing another female bomber (it was also claimed the second woman died from a bullet wound&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commersant.com/p-1753/r_500/Russians_are_Coming/ Russians are Coming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722072648/http://www.commersant.com/p-1753/r_500/Russians_are_Coming/ |date=22 July 2011 }}, ''[[Kommersant]]'', 9 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;) and several of the selected hostages, as well as mortally injuring one male hostage-taker.

====Beginning of the siege====
[[File:Beslan hostage crisis initial plan.svg|thumb|right|Overhead map of school showing initial positions of Russian forces]]

A security cordon was soon established around the school, consisting of the Russian police (''[[militsiya]]''), [[Internal Troops]], and [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]] forces; [[Spetsnaz]], including the elite ''[[Alpha Group|Alpha]]'' and ''[[Vympel]]'' units of the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Russian Federal Security Service]] (FSB); and the [[OMON]] special units of the [[Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD). A line of three apartment buildings facing the school gym was evacuated and taken over by the special forces. The perimeter they made was within {{convert|225|m}} of the school, inside the range of the militants' grenade launchers.&lt;ref name="wounds"/&gt; No fire-fighting equipment was in position and, despite the previous experiences of the 2002 [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]], there were few ambulances ready.&lt;ref name="hell"/&gt; The chaos was worsened by the presence of Ossetian volunteer militiamen (''opolchentsy'') and armed civilians among the crowds of relatives who had gathered at the scene;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090103173528/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20040905/ai_n12759334 The Beslan Massacre: `Accidental' bomb blast was trigger for], ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'', 5 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; there were perhaps as many as 5,000 of them.&lt;ref name="hell"/&gt;

The attackers mined the gym and the rest of the building with [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs), and surrounded it with tripwires. In a further bid to deter rescue attempts, they threatened to kill 50 hostages for every one of their own members killed by the police, and to kill 20 hostages for every gunman injured.&lt;ref name="hell"/&gt; They also threatened to blow up the school if government forces attacked. To avoid being overwhelmed by gas attack like their comrades in the 2002 Moscow hostage crisis, insurgents quickly smashed the school's windows. The captors prevented hostages from eating and drinking (calling this a "[[hunger strike]]", which they said they joined too) until North Ossetia's President [[Alexander Dzasokhov]] would arrive to negotiate with them.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; However, the FSB set up their own crisis headquarters from which Dzasokhov was excluded, and threatened to arrest him if he tried to go to the school.&lt;ref name="Satter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="breakdown"/&gt;

The Russian government announced that it would not use force to rescue the hostages, and negotiations towards a peaceful resolution took place on the first and second days, at first led by [[Leonid Roshal]], a pediatrician whom the hostage-takers had reportedly asked for by name (Roshal had helped negotiate the release of children in the 2002 Moscow siege, but also had given advice to the Russian security services as they prepared to storm the theatre, for which he received the [[Hero of Russia]] award). However, a witness statement in the court indicated that the Russian negotiators confused Roshal with [[Vladimir Rushailo]], a Russian security official.&lt;ref name = "Rin.ru-Beslan-20070214"&gt;{{cite web|date=7 October 2005|url=http://news.rin.ru/eng/news_text/278/|title=Beslan terrorists confused Roshal with Rushailo|publisher=Russian Information Network|accessdate=14 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Savelyev's report, the official ("civilian") headquarters was looking for a peaceful resolution of the situation at the same time when the secret ("heavy") headquarters set up by the FSB was preparing the assault. Savelyev wrote that in many ways the "heavies" restricted the actions of the "civilians", in particular in their attempts to negotiate with the militants.&lt;ref name="truth"/&gt;

At Russia's request, a special meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council]] was convened on the evening of 1 September, at which the council members demanded "the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages of the terrorist attack."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=1 September 2002 |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/sc8179.doc.htm|title=Security Council, in presidential statement, condemns hostage-taking|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=14 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President [[George W.

In the afternoon, the gunmen allowed [[Ruslan Aushev]], respected ex-[[President of Ingushetia]] and retired [[Soviet Army]] general, to enter the school building and agreed to release 11 nursing women and all 15 babies personally to him.&lt;ref name="killers_set_terms" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new_video_of"&gt;{{cite news|date=21 January 2005 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/01/20/48hours/main668127.shtml |title=New Video Of Beslan School Terror |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=29 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715060844/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/01/20/48hours/main668127.shtml |archivedate=15 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The women's older children were left behind and one mother refused to leave, so Aushev carried out her child instead.&lt;ref name="new" /&gt; The rebels gave Aushev a video tape made in the school and a note with demands from their purported leader, Shamil Basayev, who was not himself present in Beslan. The existence of the note was kept secret by the Russian authorities, while the tape was declared as being empty (which was later proved incorrect). It was falsely announced that the hostage-takers made no demands.&lt;ref name="Satter"/&gt; In the note, Basayev demanded recognition of a "formal independence for Chechnya" in the frame of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. He also said that although the Chechen separatists "had played no part" in the [[Russian apartment bombings|Russian apartment bombings of 1999]], they would now publicly take responsibility for them if needed.&lt;ref name="Satter"/&gt; Some Russian officials and state-controlled media later attacked Aushev for entering the school, accusing him of colluding with the hostage-takers.&lt;ref name="away"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article559816.ece Beslan mothers tell Putin: stay away], ''[[The Times]]'', 28 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of food and water took its toll on the young children, many of whom were forced to stand for long periods in the hot, tightly packed gym. Many children took off their clothing because of the sweltering heat within the gymnasium, which led to rumours of sexual impropriety, though the hostages later explained it was merely due to the stifling heat and being denied any water. Many children fainted, and parents feared they would die. Some hostages drank their own urine. Occasionally, the militants (many of whom took off their masks) took out some of the unconscious children and poured water on their heads before returning them to the sports hall. Later in the day, some adults also started to faint from fatigue and thirst. Because of the conditions in the gym, when the explosion and gun battle began on the third day, many of the surviving children were so fatigued that they were barely able to flee from the carnage.&lt;ref name="beslan_children_testify" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=14 September 2004 |url=http://www.sptimes.ru/story/1546 |title=Boy in Hostage Videotape Recounts How He Survived the Beslan Ordeal |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |accessdate=29 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003324/http://www.sptimes.ru/story/1546 |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crying of the children irritated them, and on several occasions crying children and their mothers were threatened with being shot if they would not stop crying.&lt;ref name="one_little_boy" /&gt; Russian authorities claimed that the hostage-takers had "listened to German heavy metal group [[Rammstein]] on personal stereos during the siege to keep themselves edgy and fired up" (Rammstein had previously come under fire following the [[Columbine High School massacre]], and again in 2007 after the [[Jokela High School shooting]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=18 October 2004 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/beslan-hostagetakers-were-on-drugs-535298.html |title=Beslan hostage-takers 'were on drugs' |first=Andrew |last=Osborn |work=The Independent |accessdate=14 February 2007 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216160409/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/beslan-hostagetakers-were-on-drugs-535298.html |archivedate=16 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Day three===
Early on the third day, Ruslan Aushev, Alexander Dzasokhov, Taymuraz Mansurov (North Ossetia's Parliament Chairman), and First Deputy Chairman Izrail Totoonti together made contact with President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, [[Aslan Maskhadov]].&lt;ref name="breakdown"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,695816,00.html Communication Breakdown], ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'', 12 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Totoonti said that both Maskhadov and his Western-based emissary [[Akhmed Zakayev]] declared they were ready to fly to Beslan to negotiate with the militants, which was later confirmed by Zakayev.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2004/09/06/014.html Zakayev Was Asked to Assist in Negotiations at the School] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327155019/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2004/09/06/014.html |date=27 March 2007 }}, ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', 6 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Totoonti said that Maskhadov's sole demand was his unhindered passage to the school; however, the assault began one hour after the agreement on his arrival was made.&lt;ref name="new details"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120910131227/http://www.jamestown.org/programs/nca/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D%3D3112%26tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D%3D188%26no_cache%3D1#91;tt_news&amp;#93;=3112&amp;tx_ttnews&amp;#91;backPid&amp;#93;=188&amp;no_cache=1 New details emerge on Maskhadov's bid to mediate in Beslan], [[The Jamestown Foundation]], 6 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="feds" /&gt; He also mentioned that journalists from [[Al Jazeera]] television offered for three days to participate in the negotiations and enter the school even as hostages, "but their services were not needed by anyone."&lt;ref name="kill"&gt;[http://www.kommersant.com/p638055/r_1/Who_Should_We_Kill_Now_Zarema?/ Who Should We Kill Now, Zarema?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103062949/http://www.kommersant.com/p638055/r_1/Who_Should_We_Kill_Now_Zarema?%2F |date=3 January 2009 }}, ''[[Kommersant]]'', 24 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian presidential advisor and former police general, an ethnic Chechen [[Aslambek Aslakhanov]], was also said to be close to breakthrough in the secret negotiations. By the time he left Moscow on the second day, Aslakhanov had accumulated the names of more than 700 well-known Russian figures who were volunteering to enter the school as hostages in exchange for the release of children. Aslakhanov said the hostage-takers agreed to allow him to enter the school the next day at 15:00. However, the storming had begun two hours before.&lt;ref name="detail"/&gt;

====The first explosions and the fire in the gymnasium====

[[File:Beslan-school-hostage-crisis.jpg|thumb|Masked hostage-taker standing on a [[dead man's switch]] during the second day of the crisis (a frame from the Aushev tape)]]

Around 13:00 on 3 September 2004, it was agreed to allow four [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Ministry of Emergency Situations]] medical workers in two ambulances to remove 20 bodies from the school grounds, as well as to bring the corpse of the killed terrorist to the school. However, at 13:03, when the paramedics approached the school, an explosion was heard from the gymnasium. The hostage-takers then opened fire on them, killing two.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; The other two took cover behind their vehicle.

The second, "strange-sounding", explosion was heard 22 seconds later.&lt;ref name="hell"/&gt; At 13:05 the fire on the roof of the sports hall started and soon the burning rafters and roofing fell onto the hostages below, many of them injured but still living.&lt;ref name="truth" /&gt; Eventually, the entire roof collapsed, turning the room into an inferno. The flames reportedly killed some 160 people (more than half of all hostage fatalities).&lt;ref name="counter"/&gt;

There are several widely conflicting versions regarding the source and nature of the explosions:

*In the final report, Alexander Torshin, head of the Russian parliamentary commission which concluded its work in December 2006, said the militants had started the battle by intentionally detonating bombs among the hostages, to the surprise of Russian negotiators and commanders. That statement went beyond previous government accounts, which have typically said the bombs exploded in an unexplained accident.&lt;ref name=question_linger&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/23/world/europe/23beslan.html?ex=1324530000&amp;en=a84fe5fbaabab7af&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|title=Questions Linger as Kremlin Reports on ’04 School Siege|work=The New York Times|accessdate=14 February 2007|first=C. J.|last=Chivers|date=23 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torshin's 2006 report says the hostage taking was planned as a [[suicide attack]] from the beginning and that no storming of the building was prepared in advance.&lt;ref name="reports"/&gt; The 2005 court ruling in Kulayev's case also determined that the explosion was set off by the militants.&lt;ref name="reports"/&gt; According to the testimonies by [[Nur-Pashi Kulayev]] and several former hostages and negotiators, the hostage-takers (including their leaders) blamed the government for the ensuing explosions.&lt;ref name="aching"/&gt;
*According to the December 2005 report by Stanislav Kesayev, deputy speaker of North Ossetian parliament, some witnesses said a federal forces sniper shot a militant whose foot was on a [[dead man's switch]] detonator, triggering the first blast.&lt;ref name="sniper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blame"/&gt; The captured hostage-taker, Nur-Pashi Kulayev, has testified to this, while a local policewoman and hostage named Fatima Dudiyeva said she was shot in the hand "from outside" just before the explosion.&lt;ref name="aching"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blame"/&gt; Kesayev's commission actually rejected the sniper shot theory,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/29/international/europe/29cnd-russia.html Russian Report Faults Rescue Efforts in Beslan], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 29 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and said there were three blasts: two small explosions at 13:03, followed by the big one at 13:29.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=16329 Kesayev Report Points a Finger in Beslan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817220237/http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=16329 |date=17 August 2007 }}, ''[[The St. Petersburg Times]]'', 9 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There was a theory presented in August 2006 by [[State Duma]] member Yuri Savelyev, a weapons and explosives expert. Savelyev said that the exchange of gunfire was not begun by explosions within the school building but by two shots fired from outside the school&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/inquests/65063.html | title=Беслан. 10 лет после теракта | publisher=[[Novaya Gazeta]] | date=1 September 2014 | accessdate=2 July 2015 | author=Yelena Milashina}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that most of the home-made explosive devices installed by the rebels did not explode at all. He says the first shot was fired most likely from an [[RPO-A Shmel (Bumblebee)|RPO-A ''Shmel'']] infantry rocket located at the roof of nearby five-story House No. 37 in School Lane and aimed at the gymnasium's attic, while the second one fired from an [[RPG-27]] grenade launcher located at the House No. 41 on the same street, destroying a fragment of the gym wall (empty shells and launchers supporting this theory were found at roofs of these houses and alternative weapons mentioned in the report were [[RPG-26]] or [[RPG-7]] rocket-propelled grenades).&lt;ref name="raw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=1 September 2006|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0901/p07s01-woeu.html|title=Russian forces faulted in Beslan school tragedy|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|accessdate=14 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/8/B841BF15-DB81-4D65-96F5-9B10F3EC9D9A.html Russia: Independent Beslan Investigation Sparks Controversy], [[The Jamestown Foundation]], 29 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Savelyev, a dissenting member of the federal Torshin commission (see below for the findings of Torshin), claims these explosions killed many of the hostages and that dozens more died in the resulting fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=29 August 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5294548.stm|title=Grenades 'caused Beslan tragedy'|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=14 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuri Ivanov, another parliamentary investigator, further contended that the grenades were fired on the direct orders of President Putin.&lt;ref name=cover_up&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundayherald.com/international/shinternational/display.var.1185416.0.0.php |title=Beslan school siege inquiry ‘a cover-up’ |work=[[Sunday Herald]] |accessdate=14 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033615/http://www.sundayherald.com/international/shinternational/display.var.1185416.0.0.php |archivedate=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several witnesses during the trial of Kulayev previously testified that the initial explosions were caused by projectiles fired from outside.&lt;ref name="reports"/&gt;

* According to the early official version, one of the bombs had been insecurely attached with adhesive tape, falling and then exploding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moscowtimes.ru/stories/2004/09/07/001.html Basketball Bomb Sparked Beslan Battle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094623/http://www.moscowtimes.ru/stories/2004/09/07/001.html |date=29 September 2007 }}, ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', 7 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; However, no one is reported to have seen this happen.&lt;ref name="uncovers"/&gt; Aushev said that an initial explosion was set off by a hostage-taker accidentally tripping over a wire. As a result, armed civilians, some of them apparently fathers of the hostages, started shooting. Aushev said no security forces or captors were shooting at this point, but the gunfire led the militants to believe that the school was being stormed.&lt;ref name="civilians"/&gt; In a similar version, Igor Senin, president of the association of Alfa veterans, said that somebody in the school building set off a hand grenade, probably by accident, after which the militants decided they were being attacked and opened fire.&lt;ref name="after"/&gt;

====Storming by Russian forces====

Part of the sports hall wall was demolished by the explosions, allowing some hostages to escape.&lt;ref name="hell"/&gt; Local militia opened fire, and the militants returned fire. A number of people were killed in the crossfire.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; Russian officials say militants shot hostages as they ran, and the military fired back.&lt;ref name="blame"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2123116 Who's To Blame for Beslan?], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 22 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The government asserts that once the shooting started, troops had no choice but to storm the building. However, some accounts from the town's residents have contradicted that official version of events.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2005/06/28/BeslanProbe_050628.html Russian military, politicians handled Beslan siege poorly: inquiry head], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]], 28 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Police Lieutenant Colonel Elbrus Nogayev, whose wife and daughter died in the school, said, "I heard a command saying, 'Stop shooting! Stop shooting!' while other troops' radios said, 'Attack!'"&lt;ref name="wounds"/&gt; As the fighting began, an oil company president and negotiator [[Mikhail Gutseriyev]] (an ethnic Ingush) phoned the hostage-takers; he heard "You tricked us!" in answer. Five hours later, Gutseriyev and his interlocutor reportedly had their last conversation, during which the man said, "The blame is yours and the Kremlin's."&lt;ref name="detail"/&gt;

According to Torshin, the order to start the operation was given by the head of the North Ossetian FSB Valery Andreyev.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4117149.stm Top officials blamed for Beslan], [[BBC News]], 22 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; However, statements by both Andreyev and the Dzasokhov indicated that it was FSB deputy directors Vladimir Pronichev and Vladimir Anisimov who were actually in charge of the Beslan operation.&lt;ref name="feds"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120910131244/http://www.jamestown.org/programs/nca/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D%3D2865%26tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D%3D187%26no_cache%3D1#91;tt_news&amp;#93;=2865&amp;tx_ttnews&amp;#91;backPid&amp;#93;=187&amp;no_cache=1 Documents suggest the feds were in charge in Beslan], [[The Jamestown Foundation]], 20 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; General Andreyev also told North Ossetia's Supreme Court that the decision to use heavy weapons during the assault was made by the head of the FSB's Special Operations Center, Colonel General [[Aleksandr Tikhonov (general)|Aleksandr Tikhonov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/12/d0b63e76-66e1-4730-93db-1df683c88e6c.html Beslan Rescue Lacked Direction, Says Ex-FSB Head], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 16 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A chaotic battle broke out as the special forces fought to enter the school. The forces included the assault groups of the FSB and the associated troops of the Russian Army and the Russian Interior Ministry, supported by a number of [[T-72]] tanks from Russia's [[58th Army]] (commandeered by Tikhonov from the military on 2 September), [[BTR-80]] wheeled armoured personnel carriers and armed helicopters, including at least one [[Mi-24]] attack helicopter.&lt;ref name="flame-throwers"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090105021010/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20041024/ai_n12762716 Flame-throwers used at Beslan siege], ''[[The Independent]]'', 24 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many local civilians also joined in the chaotic battle, having brought along their own weapons – at least one of the armed volunteers is known to have been killed.

Increased security measures were introduced to Russian cities after the crisis. More than 10,000 people without proper documents were detained by Moscow police in a "terrorist hunt".

===Long-term effects===
In the wake of Beslan, the government proceeded to toughen laws on terrorism and expand the powers of law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="shadow" /&gt;

In addition, Vladimir Putin signed a law which replaced the direct election of the heads of the [[federal subjects of Russia]] with a system whereby they are proposed by the President of Russia and approved or disapproved by the elected legislative bodies of the federal subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3965845.stm Russian Duma backs Putin reforms], [[BBC News]], 29 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The election system for the Russian parliament was also repeatedly amended, eliminating the election of State Duma members by single-mandate districts.&lt;ref name="silence"&gt;[https://archive.is/20071225075931/http://context.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2007/10/12/105.html A Deafening Silence], ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', 12 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kremlin consolidated its control over the Russian media and increasingly attacked the non-governmental organizations (especially those foreign-founded).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=18679&amp;prog=zru After Beslan, the Media in Shackles] 4 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The raid on Beslan had more to do with the Ingush involved than the Chechens, but was highly symbolic for both nations. The Ossetes and Ingush had (and have) a conflict over ownership of the [[Prigorodny District]], which hit high points during the 1944 Stalinist purges, and the [[ethnic cleansing]] of Ingush by Ossetes (the Ossetes getting assistance from the Russian military) in 1992-3. At the time of the raid, there were still over 40,000 Ingush refugees in tent camps in Ingushetia and Chechnya.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Liz. "Are Ingushetia, North Ossetia on the Verge of New Hostilities?", [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 28 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Beslan school itself had been used against the Ingush, as in 1992 the gym was used as a pen to round up Ingush during the ethnic cleansing by the Ossetes. For the Chechens, the motive was revenge for the destruction of their homes and, indeed families: Beslan was one of the sites from which federal air raids were launched at Chechnya.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Weir, "Russia Struggles to Keep Its Grip on the Caucasus", ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', 13 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Tskhurbayev and Valery Dzutsev, 'Fear and Tension in Siege Town', IWPR Caucasus Reporting Service, 2 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once it was broadcast that there were large numbers of children killed by a group that included Chechens, the Chechens were struck with a large amount of shame. One spokesman for the Chechen independence cause stated, "Such a bigger blow could not be dealt upon us...People around the world will think that Chechens are monsters if they could attack children".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/opinion/31pape.html?pagewanted=2&amp;emc=eta1|work=The New York Times|title=What Makes Chechen Women So Dangerous?|first1=Robert A.|last1=Pape|first2=Lindsey|last2=O'Rourke|first3=Jenna|last3=McDermit|date=31 March 2010|accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MoscowRegion-p1030244.jpg|thumb|Monument in [[Moscow Oblast]]]]

===Responsibility===
Initially, the identity and origin of the attackers were not clear. It was widely assumed from day two that they were separatists from nearby Chechnya, even as Putin's presidential Chechen aide Aslambek Aslakhanov denied it, saying "they were not Chechens. When I started talking with them in [[Chechen language|Chechen]], they had answered: 'We do not understand, speak Russian.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=8 September 2004 |accessdate=11 April 2015 |url=http://old.radiomayak.ru/schedules/6852/17139.html |publisher=Radio Mayak |script-title=ru:На этом этапе мы должны быть бдительны |language=ru |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106005247/http://old.radiomayak.ru/schedules/6852/17139.html |archivedate=6 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freed hostages said that the hostage-takers spoke Russian with [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]] typical of [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasians]].&lt;ref name="hell"/&gt;

Even though in the past Putin had rarely hesitated to blame the Chechen separatists for acts of terrorism, this time he avoided linking the attack with the Second Chechen War. Instead, he blamed the crisis on the "direct intervention of international terrorism", ignoring the nationalist roots of the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2004/09/ce476827-01ec-417f-a41c-44b2019e125f.html Russia: On Beslan, Putin Looks Beyond Chechnya, Sees International Terror], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 7 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian government sources initially claimed that nine of the militants in Beslan were [[Arabs]] and one was a black African (called "a [[negro]]" by Andreyev),&lt;ref name="aftermath"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,363934,00.html The Beslan Aftermath: New Papers Critical of Russian Security Forces], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 4 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.%3A%2F%2Fidl.stanford.edu%2F103%2Fchechnya%2FIDL103_Additional_Reading_7.pdf Chechnya: 'War on terror' legends debunked]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; though only two Arabs were identified later.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; Independent analysts such as that of the Moscow political commentator [[Andrei Piontkovsky]] said Putin at this moment tried to minimize the number and scale of Chechen terrorist attacks, rather than to exaggerate them as he did in the past.&lt;ref name="doubt"/&gt; Putin appeared to connect the events to the US-led "[[War on Terrorism]]",&lt;ref name="world"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901040920-695815,00.html "The Whole World Is Crying"], ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'', 12 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; but at the same time accused the West of indulging terrorists.&lt;ref name="soft"&gt;{{cite web|date=17 September 2004|url=http://www.afpc.org/rrm/rrm1192.shtml|title=Putin: Western governments soft on terror|publisher=[[American Foreign Policy Council]]|accessdate=29 July 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051119073547/http://www.afpc.org/rrm/rrm1192.shtml |archivedate = 19 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 September 2004, radical Chechen guerilla commander Shamil Basayev, at this time operating autonomously from the rest of the North Caucasian rebel movement, issued a statement claiming responsibility for the Beslan school siege,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=17 September 2004|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/09/17/russia.beslan/|title=Chechen 'claims Beslan attack'|publisher=CNN|accessdate=29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was strikingly similar to the [[Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis|Chechen raid on Budyonnovsk]] in 1995 and the Moscow theatre crisis in 2002, incidents in which hundreds of Russian civilians were held hostage by the Chechen rebels led by Basayev. Basayev said his Riyad-us Saliheen "brigade of martyrs" had carried out the attack and also claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist bombings in Russia in the weeks before Beslan crisis. He said that he originally planned to seize at least one school in either Moscow or Saint Petersburg, but lack of funds forced him to pick North Ossetia, "the Russian garrison in the North Caucasus". Basayev blamed the Russian authorities for "a terrible tragedy" in Beslan.&lt;ref name="claims"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3665136.stm Excerpts: Basayev claims Beslan], BBC News, 17 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Basayev claimed that he had miscalculated the Kremlin's determination to end the crisis by all means possible.&lt;ref name="shadow"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120106032623/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/chechnya-vow-cast-a-long-shadow/356028.html Chechnya Vow Cast a Long Shadow] ''The Moscow Times'', 26 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He said he was "cruelly mistaken" and that he was "not delighted by what happened there", but also added to be "planning more Beslan-type operations in the future because we are forced to do so."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article509888.ece We're going to do it again, says man behind Beslan bloodbath] ''The Times'', 3 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was the last major act of terrorism in Russia until 2009, as Basayev was soon persuaded to give up indiscriminate attacks by the new rebel leader [[Abdul-Halim Sadulayev]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080918223149/http://www.jamestown.org/chechnya_weekly/article.php?articleid=2373424 No Terrorist Acts in Russia Since Beslan: Whom to Thank?], The Jamestown Foundation, 24 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; who made Basayev his second-in-command but banned hostage taking, kidnapping for ransom, and operations specifically targeting civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/27/chechnya.russia Beslan massacre chief promoted] ''The Independent'', 27 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chechen separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov immediately denied that his forces were involved in the siege, calling it "a blasphemy" for which "there is no justification". Maskhadov described the perpetrators of Beslan as "madmen" driven out of their senses by Russian acts of brutality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/459302.stm Obituary: Aslan Maskhadov], [[BBC News]], 8 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He condemned the action and all attacks against civilians via a statement issued by his envoy Akhmed Zakayev in London, blamed it on what he called a radical local group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2004/09/mil-040914-22f19307.htm VOA News report], Globalsecurity.org, 14 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and agreed to the North Ossetian proposition to act as a negotiator. Later, he also called on western governments to initiate peace talks between Russia and Chechnya and added to "categorically refute all accusations by the Russian government that President Maskhadov had any involvement in the Beslan event."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3655438.stm Chechen envoy warns of bloodshed], [[BBC News]], 14 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Putin responded that he would not negotiate with "child-killers",&lt;ref name="rejects"/&gt; comparing the calls for negotiations with the [[appeasement of Hitler]],&lt;ref name="soft"/&gt; and put a $10 million [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] on Maskhadov (the same amount as put for Basayev).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0929/p06s01-woeu.html Putin's Chechnya options narrow], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', 29 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Maskhadov was killed by Russian commandos in Chechnya on 8 March 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4330039.stm Chechen leader Maskhadov killed], [[BBC News]], 8 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and buried at an undisclosed location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4473737.stm Russia buries Maskhadov in secret], [[BBC News]], 22 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the crisis, official Russian sources stated that the attackers were part of a supposed international group led by Basayev that included a number of Arabs with connections to [[al-Qaeda]], and claimed they picked up phone calls in [[Arabic]] from the Beslan school to [[Saudi Arabia]] and another undisclosed Middle Eastern country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=27 September 2004|url=https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,2763,1313441,00.html|title=Beslan militants 'called Middle East'|work=The Guardian|accessdate=29 July 2006|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two English/[[Algeria]]ns were initially named as being among the identified rebels who actively participated in the attack: Osman Larussi and [[Yacine Benalia]]. Another UK citizen named [[Kamel Rabat Bouralha]], arrested while trying to leave Russia immediately following the attack, was suspected to be a key organizer. All three were linked to the [[Finsbury Park Mosque]] of north London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=3 October 2004|url=https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,2763,1318586,00.html|title=London mosque link to Beslan|work=The Guardian|accessdate=29 July 2006|first=Jason|last=Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allegations of al-Qaeda involvement were not repeated since then by the Russian government.&lt;ref name="counter"/&gt; Larussi and Benalia are not named in the Torshin report and were never identified by Russian authorities as suspects in the Beslan attack.&lt;ref&gt;See the Torshin report's list of perpetrators; their names are absent.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following people were named by the Russian government as planners and financiers of the attack:
* [[Shamil Basayev]] – Chechen rebel leader who took ultimate responsibility for the attack. He died in Ingushetia in July 2006 in disputed circumstances.
* [[Kamel Rabat Bouralha]] – British-Algerian suspected of organizing the attack, who was reportedly detained in Chechnya in September 2004.
* [[Abu Omar al-Saif]] – [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] national and accused financer,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930182930/http://www.jamestown.org/print_friendly.php?volume_id=409&amp;issue_id=3567&amp;article_id=2370604 Abu Omar reportedly killed], [[Jamestown Foundation]], 15 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; killed in Dagestan in December 2005.
* [[Abu Zaid Al-Kuwaiti]] – [[Kuwait]]i and accused organizer, who died in Ingushetia in February 2005.

In November 2004, 28-year-old Akhmed Merzhoyev and 16-year-old Marina Korigova of [[Sagopshi]], Ingushetia, were arrested by the Russian authorities in connection with Beslan. Merzhoyev was charged with providing food and equipment to the hostage-takers, and Korigova with having possession of a phone that Tsechoyev had phoned multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elitestv.com/pub/2004/Nov/EEN419d03f1b16c5.html Two Arrested in Russia for School Hostage Situation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906110202/http://www.elitestv.com/pub/2004/Nov/EEN419d03f1b16c5.html |date=6 September 2008 }}, EliteTV.com, November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Korigova was released when her defence attorney showed that she was given the phone by an acquaintance after the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchdog.cz/?show=000000-000008-000001-000352&amp;lang=1 Girl suspected of links with Beslan terrorists released], [[Prague Watchdog]], 2 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motives and demands===
Russian negotiators say the Beslan militants never explicitly stated their demands, although they did have notes handwritten by one of the hostages on a school notebook, in which they spelled out demands of full Russian troop withdrawal from Chechnya and recognition of Chechen [[independence]].

The hostage-takers were reported to have made the following demands:
* Recognition of the independence of Chechnya at the UN and withdrawal of Russian troops
* Presence of the following people at the school: [[Aleksander Dzasokhov]] (president of North Ossetia), [[Murat Zyazikov]] (president of Ingushetia), Ruslan Aushev (former president of Ingushetia), [[Leonid Roshal]] (a paediatrician). Alternatively, instead of Roshal and Aushev, the hostage-takers might have named Vladimir Rushailo and [[Alu Alkhanov]] (pro-Moscow [[President of Chechnya]]).&lt;ref name = "Rin.ru-Beslan-20070214"/&gt;

Dzasokhov and Zyazikov did not come to Beslan (Dzasokhov later claimed that he was forcibly stopped by "a very high-ranking general from the Interior Ministry [who] said, 'I have received orders to arrest you if you try to go'").&lt;ref name="breakdown"/&gt; The stated reason why Zyazikov did not arrive was that he has been "sick".&lt;ref name="detail"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081225013256/http://fairuse.1accesshost.com/news2/latimes298.html Critics Detail Missteps in School Crisis], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 17 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Aushev, Zyazikov's predecessor at the post of Ingushetia's president (he was forced to resign by Putin in 2002), entered the school and secured the release of 26 hostages.

Aslakhanov said that the hostage-takers also demanded the release of some 28 to 30 suspects detained in the crackdown following the [[2004 Nazran raid|rebel raids in Ingushetia]] earlier in June.&lt;ref name="insurgents"/&gt;&lt;ref name="counter"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="padding:1em; border:1px dashed #2f6fab; color:black; background:#efefef; line-height:1.1em;"&gt;From [[Allah]]'s slave Shamil Basayev to President Putin.

Vladimir Putin, it was not you who started this war. But you can finish it if you have enough courage and determination of [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]. We offer you a sensible peace based on mutual benefit by the principle independence in exchange for security. In case of troops withdrawal and acknowledgement of independence of [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]], we are obliged not to make any political, military, or economic treaties with anyone against Russia, not to accommodate foreign military bases on our territory even temporarily, not to support and not to finance groups or organizations carrying out a military struggle against RF, to be present in the united [[ruble]] zone, to enter [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]. Besides, we can sign a treaty even though a [[neutral country|neutral state]] status is more acceptable to us. We can also guarantee a renunciation of armed struggle against RF by all Muslims of Russia for at least 10 to 15 years under condition of freedom of faith. We are not related to the [[Russian apartment bombings|apartment bombings in Moscow and Volgodonsk]], but we can take responsibility for this in an acceptable way.

The Chechen people is leading a [[Wars of national liberation|nation-liberating struggle]] for its freedom and independence, for its self-protection rather than for destruction or humiliation of Russia. We offer you peace, but the choice is yours.

Later, Basayev said there was also an alternative option: if President Putin submitted a letter of resignation, the hostage-takers would "release all the children and go back to Chechnya with others."&lt;ref name="claims"/&gt;

===Hostage-takers===
According to the official version of events, 32 militants participated directly in the seizure, one of whom was taken alive while the rest were killed on spot. The number and identity of hostage-takers remains a controversial topic, fuelled by the often contradictory government statements and official documents. The 3–4 September government statements said total of 26–27 militants were killed during the siege.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; At least four militants, including two women, died prior to the Russian storming of the school.

Many of the surviving hostages and eyewitnesses claim there were many more captors, some of whom may have escaped. It was also initially claimed that three hostage-takers were captured alive, including their leader [[Vladimir Khodov]] and a female militant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090104113042/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20041109/ai_n12822067 Beslan hostage-takers were allowed to flee, soldier says], ''[[The Independent]]'', 9 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Witness testimonies during the Kulayev trial involved the reported presence of a number of apparently [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]-, unaccented Russian-, and "perfect" Ossetian-speaking individuals among the hostage-takers who were not seen among the bodies of the militants killed during the assault by Russian security forces; witnesses also said they were not seen by the day of the crisis at all.&lt;ref name="snipers"/&gt; The unknown men (and a woman, according to one testimony) included a man with red beard who was reportedly issuing orders to the kidnappers' leaders, and whom the hostages were forbidden to look at. He was possibly the militant known only as "Fantomas", an ethnic Russian who served as a bodyguard to Shamil Basayev.&lt;ref name="counter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="snipers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/focus/story/0,6903,1297633,00.html When hell came calling at Beslan's School No 1], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 5 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Kesayev Report (2005) estimated that about 50 rebel fighters took part in the siege, based on witness accounts and the number of weapons left at the scene.&lt;ref name="reports"/&gt;
*The Savelyev Report (September 2006) said there were from 58 to 76 hostage-takers, of which many managed to escape by slipping past the cordon around the school.&lt;ref name="reports"/&gt;
*The Torshin Report (December 2006) determined that 34 militants were involved, of which 32 entered the school and 31 died there, and says the two accomplices remain at large (one being Yunus Matsiyev, a bodyguard of Basayev).&lt;ref name="reports"/&gt;

According to Basayev, "Thirty-three [[mujahideen]] took part in [[Moscow theater hostage crisis|Nord-West]]. Two of them were women. We prepared four [women] but I sent two of them to Moscow on August 24. They then boarded [[Russian aircraft bombings of August 2004|the two airplanes that blew up]]. In the group there were 12 Chechen men, two Chechen women, nine Ingush, three Russians, two Arabs, two Ossetians, one [[Tatars|Tartar]], one [[Kabardin]]ian and one [[Gurans|Guran]]. The Gurans are a people who live near [[Lake Baikal]] who are practically [[Russification|russified]]."&lt;ref name="band"/&gt;

Basayev further said an FSB agent (Khodov) had been sent undercover to the rebels to persuade them to carry out an attack on a target in North Ossetia's capital, Vladikavkaz, and that the group was allowed to enter the region with ease because the FSB planned to capture them at their destination in Vladikavkaz. He also claimed that an unnamed hostage-taker had survived the siege and managed to escape.&lt;ref name="mystery"/&gt;

====Identities====
On 6 September 2004, the names and identities of seven of the assailants became known, after forensic work over the weekend and interviews with surviving hostages and a captured assailant. The forensic tests also established that 21 of the hostage-takers took heroin,&lt;ref&gt;''The 2002 Dubrovka and 2004 Beslan Hostage Crises: A Critique of Russian Counter-terrorism'' {{ISBN|978-3-838-25608-5}} p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Methamphetamine as well as [[morphine]] in a normally lethal amount;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=28 December 2005|url=http://eng.kavkaz.memo.ru/newstext/engnews/id/912681.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513091657/http://eng.kavkaz.memo.ru/newstext/engnews/id/912681.html|archivedate=13 May 2006|title=Federal commission delivers report on Beslan|publisher=[[Memorial (society)|Memorial]]|accessdate=29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiating with Terrorists: Strategy, Tactics, and Politics'' {{ISBN|978-0-415-56629-2}} p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; the investigation cited the use of drugs as a reason for the militants' ability to continue fighting despite being badly wounded and presumably in great pain. In November 2004, Russian officials announced that 27 of the 32 hostage-takers had been identified. However, in September 2005, the lead prosecutor against Nur-Pashi Kulayev stated that only 22 of the 32 bodies of the captors had been identified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=12 September 2004 |title=Russian Prosecutor Says International Terrorists Planned Beslan|publisher=Mosnews&lt;!--|accessdate=29 July 2006--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to further confusion over which identities have been confirmed.

Most of the suspects, aged 20–35, were identified as Ingush or residents of Ingushetia (some of them Chechen refugees). At least five of the suspected hostage-takers were declared dead by Russian authorities before the seizure, while eight were known to have been previously arrested and then released, in some cases shortly before the Beslan attack.

==Official investigations and trials==

===Kulayev's interrogation and trial===
[[File:Beslan kollazh.jpg|thumb|A collage depicting School Number One, photos of killed hostages and the Tree of Grief monument]]

The captured suspect, 24-year-old Nur-Pashi Kulayev, born in Chechnya, was identified by former hostages as one of the hostage-takers. The state-controlled [[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]] showed fragments of Kulayev's interrogation in which he said his group was led by a Chechnya-born man nicknamed ''Polkovnik'' and by the North Ossetia native Vladimir Khodov. According to Kulayev, ''Polkovnik'' shot another militant and detonated two female suicide bombers because they objected to capturing children.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080223150208/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=401&amp;issue_id=3063&amp;article_id=2368474 Ingush ex-cop reportedly among hostage-takers], [[The Jamestown Foundation]], 8 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation by federal prosecutors===
Family members of the victims of the attacks have accused the security forces of incompetence, and have demanded that authorities be held accountable. Putin personally promised to the [[Mothers of Beslan]] group to hold an "objective investigation". On 26 December 2005, Russian prosecutors investigating the siege on the school declared that authorities had made no mistakes whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=26 December 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4561052.stm|title='No mistakes', Beslan report says|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torshin's parliamentary commission===
At a press conference with foreign journalists on 6 September 2004, Vladimir Putin rejected the prospect of an open public inquiry, but cautiously agreed with an idea of a parliamentary investigation led by the State Duma, dominated by the pro-Kremlin parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=8 September 2004 |url=http://www.kremlin.ru/text/publications/2004/09/76490.shtml |title=Putin does not see a link between Chechnya and Beslan |publisher=[[Nezavisimaya Gazeta]], cited by kremlin.ru |accessdate=20 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071018054028/http://kremlin.ru/text/publications/2004/09/76490.shtml |archivedate = 18 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/07/russia.chechnya Angry Putin rejects public Beslan inquiry], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 7 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2004, the [[Interfax]] news agency reported Alexander Torshin, head of the parliamentary commission, as saying that there was evidence of involvement by "a foreign intelligence agency" (he declined to say which).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=27 November 2004 |url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/27nov2004/torshin.html |title=Foreign intelligence involved in Beslan school capture |publisher=[[Interfax]], cited by [[NEWSru]] |accessdate=20 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 2006, the Russian parliamentary commission ended their investigation into the incident. Their report concluded that the number of gunmen who stormed the school was 32 and laid much of the blame on the North Ossetian police, stating that there was a severe shortcoming in security measures, but also criticizing authorities for under-reporting the number of hostages involved.&lt;ref name="probe"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2005/12/28/beslan051228.html Beefed-up security could have prevented Beslan siege, probe head says], [[CBC News]], 28 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the commission said the attack on the school was premeditated by Chechen rebel leadership, including the moderate leader Aslan Maskhadov. In another controversial move, the commission claimed that the shoot-out that ended the siege was instigated by the hostage-takers, not security forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6202735.stm Rebels blamed for Beslan deaths], [[BBC News]], 22 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; About the "grounded" decision to use flamethowers, Torshin said that "international law does not prohibit using them against terrorists."&lt;ref name="caused"&gt;[https://archive.is/20070518140813/http://www.borrull.org/e/noticia.php?id=55413&amp;id2=4966 FSB flamethrowers caused no fire at Beslan school], [[RIA Novosti]], 28 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Ella Kesayeva, an activist who leads a Beslan support group, suggested that the report was meant as a signal that Putin and his circle were no longer interested in having a discussion about the crisis.&lt;ref name=question_linger /&gt;

On 28 August 2006, Duma member Yuri Savelyev, a member of the federal parliamentary inquiry panel, publicized his own report which he said proves that Russian forces deliberately stormed the school using maximum force. According to Savelyev, a weapons and explosives expert, special forces fired rocket-propelled grenades without warning as a prelude to an armed assault, ignoring apparently ongoing negotiations. In February 2007, two members of the commission (Savelyev and Yuri Ivanov) denounced the investigation as a cover-up, and the Kremlin's official version of events as fabricated. They refused to sign off on the Torshin's report.&lt;ref name=cover_up /&gt;

===Trials of the local police officials===
Three local policemen of the [[Pravoberezhny District]] ROVD (district militsiya unit) were the only officials put on trial over the massacre. They were charged with negligence in failing to stop gunmen seizing the school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3678066.stm Hundreds still missing in Beslan], [[BBC News]], 21 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 2007, the Pravoberezhny Court's judge granted an [[amnesty]] to them. In response, a group of dozens of local women rioted and ransacked the courtroom by smashing windows, overturning furniture, and tearing down a Russian flag. Victims' groups said the trial had been a whitewash designed to protect their superiors from blame.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2973589920070529 Amnesty granted to Beslan siege police], [[Reuters]], 29 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The victims of the siege said they would appeal against the court judgement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081227082316/http://eng.kavkaz.memo.ru/newstext/engnews/id/1188208.html Amnesty act applied to Beslan militiamen will be appealed against], [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]], 30 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, a court in [[Kabardino-Balkaria]] charged two [[Malgobeksky District]] ROVD police officials, Mukhazhir Yevloyev and Akhmed Kotiyev, with negligence, accusing them of failing to prevent the attackers from setting up their training and staging camp in Ingushetia. The two pleaded innocent,&lt;ref name="sue"&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2007/06/29/013.html Beslan Mothers Sue in Strasbourg] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911154843/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2007/06/29/013.html |date=11 September 2007 }}, ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', 29 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and were acquitted in October 2007.

==Criticism of the Russian government==

===Allegations of incompetence and rights violations===
The handling of the siege by Vladimir Putin's administration was criticized by a number of observers and grassroots organizations, amongst them Mothers of Beslan and [[Voice of Beslan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110827035818/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/beslan-mothers-stay-in-court-all-night/197300.html Beslan Mothers Stay In Court All Night], ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the crisis, the independent MP [[Vladimir Ryzhkov]] blamed "the top leadership" of Russia.&lt;ref name="media"/&gt; Initially, the [[European Union]] also criticized the response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=5 September 2004|url=https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,,1297703,00.html|title=EU doubts shatter unity|work=The Guardian|accessdate=31 July 2006|location=London|first=David|last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics, including Beslan residents who survived the attack and relatives of the victims, focused on allegations that the storming of the school was ruthless. They cite the use of heavy weapons, such as tanks and ''Shmel'' rocket flamethrowers.&lt;ref name="flame-throwers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rus.tmtbb.ru/news/article/beslan-residents-say-forces-used-grenades/224058.html Beslan Residents Say Forces Used Grenades] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826113643/http://rus.tmtbb.ru/news/article/beslan-residents-say-forces-used-grenades/224058.html |date=26 August 2011 }}, ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', 6 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moms"&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-beslan_nu_rodriguezjan18,1,1649328,full.story Beslan moms blame Putin, face charges]{{Dead link|date=April 2016}}, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 18 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Their usage was officially confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravdabeslana.ru/pass.htm The sensational statement of the representative of public prosecutor: "Tanks and flame throwers were used during the storm"], ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' 7 April 2005 (Pravda Beslana translation/mirror)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Shmel'' is a type of thermobaric weapon, described by a source associated with the US military as "just about the most vicious weapon you can imagine – igniting the air, sucking the oxygen out of an enclosed area and creating a massive pressure wave crushing anything unfortunate enough to have lived through the conflagration."&lt;ref name="aching"/&gt; Pavel Felgenhauer has gone further and accused the government of also firing rockets from an Mi-24 attack helicopter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kolumbus.fi/suomi-tshetshenia-seura/howthe.htm How The School Was Stormed], ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'', 7 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; a claim that the authorities deny.&lt;ref name="flame-throwers"/&gt; Some human rights activists claim that at least 80% of the hostages were killed by indiscriminate Russian fire.&lt;ref name="Satter"/&gt; According to Felgenhauer, "It was not a hostage rescue operation... but an army operation aimed at wiping out the terrorists."&lt;ref name="flame-throwers"/&gt; [[David Satter]] of the [[Hudson Institute]] said the incident "presents a chilling portrait of the Russian leadership and its total disregard for human life".&lt;ref name="hudson"/&gt;

The provincial government and police were criticised by the locals for having allowed the attack to take place, especially since police roadblocks on the way to Beslan were removed shortly before the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kalmykia.eng.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/4211/ Beslan victims talk to Kulayev], [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]], 7 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Many blamed rampant corruption that allowed the attackers to bribe their way through the checkpoints; in fact, this was even what they had openly boasted to their hostages.&lt;ref name="blame"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laughs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iwpr.net/?p=crs&amp;s=f&amp;o=243899&amp;apc_state=henicrs2005 North Ossetia: Quit While You're Behind], [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]], 9 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Others say the militants took the back roads used by smugglers in collusion with the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2133395/entry/2133396/ So Much for Glasnost], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 28 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yulia Latynina]] alleged that Major Gurazhev was captured after he approached the militants' truck to demand a bribe for what he thought was an oil-smuggling operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=19941 Too Many Exceptions to Be a Rule] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227154113/http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=19941 |date=27 December 2008 }}, ''[[The St. Petersburg Times]]'', 29 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also alleged the federal police knew of the time and place of the planned attack; according to internal police documents obtained by ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'', the Moscow MVD knew about the hostage taking four hours in advance, having learned this from a militant captured in Chechnya.&lt;ref name="Satter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110831120149/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/police-under-fire-for-beslan/196228.html Police Under Fire for Beslan], ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', 20 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Basayev, the road to Beslan was cleared of roadblocks because the FSB planned to ambush the group later, believing the rebels' aim was to seize the parliament of North Ossetia in Vladikavkaz.

Critics also charged that the authorities did not organize the siege properly, including failing to keep the scene secure from entry by civilians,&lt;ref name="civilians"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3634114.stm Civilians 'began siege shooting'], [[BBC News]], 7 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; while the emergency services were not prepared during the 52 hours of the crisis.&lt;ref name="legacy" /&gt; The Russian government has been also heavily criticized by many of the local people who, days and even months after the siege, did not know whether their children were alive or dead, as the hospitals were isolated from the outside world.{{clarify|date=April 2012}} Two months after the crisis, human remains and identity documents were found by a local driver, Muran Katsanov,&lt;ref name="aching"/&gt; in the garbage landfill at the outskirts of Beslan; the discovery prompted further outrage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article415412.ece Victims of Beslan siege found in a rubbish dump], ''[[The Times]]'', 26 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080223150119/http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2369369 New remains discovered in Beslan: Incompetence or crime?], [[The Jamestown Foundation]], 4 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there were serious accusations that federal officials had not earnestly tried to negotiate with the hostage-takers (including the alleged threat from Moscow to arrest President Dzasokhov if he came to negotiate) and deliberately provided incorrect and inconsistent reports of the situation to the media.

====Independent reports====
The report by Yuri Savelyev, a dissenting parliamentary investigator and one of Russia's leading rocket scientists, placed the responsibility for the final massacre on actions of the Russian forces and the highest-placed officials in the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/10/world/russian-s-links-to-iran-offer-a-case-study-in-arms-leaks.html?pagewanted=all Russian's Links to Iran Offer a Case Study in Arms Leak], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 10 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Savelyev's 2006 report, devoting 280 pages to determining responsibility for the initial blast, concludes that the authorities decided to storm the school building, but wanted to create the impression they were acting in response to actions taken by the terrorists.&lt;ref name="reports"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;These allegations are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this article.&lt;/ref&gt; Savelyev, the only expert on the physics of combustion on the commission, accused Torshin of "deliberate falsification".&lt;ref name="hudson"&gt;[http://www.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&amp;id=4306&amp;pubType=HI_Articles The Aftermath of Beslan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026084542/http://www.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&amp;id=4306&amp;pubType=HI_Articles |date=26 October 2008 }}, [[Hudson Institute]], 15 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate public inquiry by the North Ossetian parliament (headed by Kesayev) concluded on 29 November 2005 that both local and federal law enforcement mishandled the situation.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;

====European Court complaint====
On 26 June 2007, 89 relatives of victims lodged a joint complaint against Russia with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The applicants say their rights were violated both during the hostage-taking and the trials that followed.&lt;ref name="sue"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/06/9866BF41-7C46-4754-8E30-09D9514C79F0.html Relatives Of Beslan Victims Apply To European Court], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 26 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was brought by over 400 Russians.&lt;ref name="ECHR"/&gt;

In an April 2017 judgement that supported the prosecutors, the court deemed that Russia's failure to act on "sufficient" evidence about a likely attack on a North Ossetia school had violated the "right to life" guaranteed by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The court stated the error was made worse by the Russian use of "indiscriminate force."&lt;ref name="www.ft.com"&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/a241456c-2034-11e7-a454-ab04428977f9&lt;/ref&gt; Result were published in April 2017, and found that Russian actions in using tank cannons, flame-throwers and grenade launchers "contributed to the casualties among the hostages", and had "not been compatible with the requirement under Article 2 that lethal force be used 'no more than [is] absolutely necessary." The report also said that "The authorities had been in possession of sufficiently specific information of a planned terrorist attack in the area, linked to an educational institution," "nevertheless, not enough had been done to disrupt the terrorists meeting and preparing," or to warn schools or the public.&lt;ref name="ECHR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/russias-response-to-beslan-school-attack-had-serious-failings-10835210 |title=Russia's Beslan school siege 'failings' breached human rights |publisher=Sky News |date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/european-court-of-human-rights-finds-serious-failings-by-russia-in-beslan-school-siege |title=European Court of Human Rights finds 'serious failings' by Russia in Beslan school siege |publisher=Straights Times |date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ECHR court in Strasbourg ordered Russia to pay €2.9m in damages and €88,000 in legal costs. The Court's findings were rejected by the Russian Government.&lt;ref name=ECHR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/world/russia-central-asia/article/2087450/russia-furious-european-courts-ruling-how-it-handled |title=Russia furious at European court’s ruling of how it handled Beslan school siege that left 330 dead |publisher=South China Morning Post |date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although obligated to accept the ruling because it is a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights, the Kremlin called the ruling "unacceptable."&lt;ref name="www.ft.com"/&gt;

===Alleged threats, disinformation and suppression of information===
{{See also|Russian government censorship of Chechnya coverage}}

====Russian television reporting and false information====
In opposition to the coverage on foreign television news channels (such as [[CNN]] and the [[BBC]]), the crisis was not broadcast live by the three major state-owned Russian television networks.&lt;ref name="silence"/&gt; The two main state-owned broadcasters, Channel One and [[Russia 1|Rossiya]], did not interrupt their regular programming following the school seizure.&lt;ref name="media"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/09/07/dl0702.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/09/07/ixportal.html Putin's media censorship], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 7 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; After explosions and gunfire started on the third day, [[NTV Russia]] shifted away from the scenes of mayhem to broadcast a [[World War II]] soap opera.&lt;ref name="chilling"/&gt; According to the ''[[Ekho Moskvy]]'' ("Echo of Moscow") radio station, 92% of the people polled said that Russian TV channels concealed parts of information.&lt;ref name="osce"/&gt;

Russian state-controlled television only reported official information about the number of hostages during the course of the crisis. The figure of 354 people was persistently given, initially reported by Lev Dzugayev (the press secretary of Dzasokhov)&lt;ref group=note&gt;After the crisis, Dzugayev was promoted and a made minister for culture and mass communications of the republic.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090104222229/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050131/ai_n9693451 Backslash in Beslan], ''[[The Independent]]'', 31 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and Valery Andreyev (the chief of the republican FSB). It was later claimed that Dzugayev only disseminated information given to him by "Russian presidential staff who were located in Beslan from September 1".&lt;ref name="feds" /&gt; Torshin laid the blame squarely at Andreyev, for whom he reserved special scorn.&lt;ref name="points"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090103212330/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051229/ai_n15983980 Beslan siege investigation chief points finger], ''[[The Independent]]'', 29 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deliberately false figure had grave consequences for the treatment of the hostages by their angered captors (the hostage-takers were reported saying, "Maybe we should kill enough of you to get down to that number") and contributed to the declaration of a "hunger strike".&lt;ref name="wounds"/&gt;&lt;ref name="probe"/&gt; One inquiry has suggested that it may have prompted the militants to kill the group of male hostages shot on the first day.&lt;ref name="points"/&gt; The government disinformation also sparked incidents of violence by the local residents, aware of the real numbers, against the members of Russian and foreign media.&lt;ref name="osce"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Miklós Haraszti|title = Report on Russian media coverage of the Beslan tragedy: Access to information and journalists' working conditions|publisher = [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]|date = 16 September 2004|url = http://www.osce.org/documents/rfm/2004/09/3586_en.pdf|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September 2004, several leading Russian and international human rights organizations – including [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]], and [[Moscow Helsinki Group]] – issued a joint statement in which they pointed out the responsibility that Russian authorities bore in disseminating false information:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We are also seriously concerned with the fact that authorities concealed the true scale of the crisis by, ''[[inter alia]]'', misinforming Russian society about the number of hostages. We call on Russian authorities to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the circumstances of the Beslan events which should include an examination of how authorities informed the whole society and the families of the hostages. We call on making the results of such an investigation public."&lt;ref name="osce"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Moscow daily tabloid ''[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]'' ran a rubric headlined "Chronicle of Lies", detailing various initial reports put out by government officials about the hostage taking, which later turned out to be false.&lt;ref name="rejects"/&gt;

====Incidents involving Russian and foreign journalists====
The late ''Novaya Gazeta'' journalist [[Anna Politkovskaya]], who had negotiated during the 2002 Moscow siege, was twice prevented by the authorities from boarding a flight. When she eventually succeeded, she fell into a coma after being poisoned aboard an aeroplane bound to [[Rostov-on-Don]].&lt;ref name="osce"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kolumbus.fi/suomi-tshetshenia-seura/what.htm On Anna Politkovskaya falling into a coma], ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'', 4 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; American journalist [[Larisa Alexandrovna]] of ''[[The Raw Story]]'' has suggested that Politkovskaya might have been [[Anna Politkovskaya assassination|later murdered in Moscow]] because she had discovered evidence of the Russian government's complicity in Beslan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/Was_former_KGB_agent_murdered_over_1126.html Was former KGB agent murdered over false-flag terrorism in Russia?], ''[[The Raw Story]]'', 26 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), several correspondents were detained or otherwise harassed after arriving in Beslan (including Russians Anna Gorbatova and Oksana Semyonova from ''[[Novye Izvestia]]'', Madina Shavlokhova from ''[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]'', [[Elena Milashina]] from ''Novaya Gazeta'', and Simon Ostrovskiy from ''[[The Moscow Times]]''). Several foreign journalists were also briefly detained, including a group of journalists from the [[Poland|Polish]] ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'', French ''[[Libération]]'', and British ''[[The Guardian]]''. Many foreign journalists were exposed to pressure from the security forces and materials were confiscated from TV crews [[ZDF]] and [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] (Germany), [[Associated Press Television News|AP Television News]] (USA), and [[Rustavi 2]] ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]). The crew of Rustavi 2 was arrested; the Georgian Minister of Health said that the correspondent Nana Lezhava, who had been kept for five days in the Russian pre-trial detention centers, had been poisoned with dangerous [[psychotropic drug]]s (like Politkovskaya, Lezhava had passed out after being given a cup of tea). The crew from another Georgian TV channel, [[Mze]], was expelled from Beslan.&lt;ref name="osce"/&gt;

Raf Shakirov, chief editor of the Russia's leading newspaper, ''[[Izvestia]]'', was forced to resign after criticism by the major shareholders of both style and content of the issue of 4 September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=8 September 2004|url=http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/2004/200409/20040908.html|title=The Current for Show September 8, 2004|publisher=[[CBC Radio One]]|accessdate=14 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070505064942/http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/2004/200409/20040908.html |archivedate = 5 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the less emotional coverage by other Russian newspapers, ''Izvestia'' had featured large pictures of dead or injured hostages.

In July 2007, the Mothers of Beslan asked the FSB to declassify video and audio archives on Beslan, saying there should be no secrets in the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/6089/ "Beslan Mothers" ask FSB to declassify video and audio archives on Beslan], [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]], 27 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They did not receive any official answer to this request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adygea.eng.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/6313/ No answer from FSB to request of "Beslan Mothers" to declassify the video archive of the tragedy], Caucasian Knot, 14 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Mothers received an anonymous video, which they disclosed saying it might prove that the Russian security forces started the massacre by firing rocket-propelled grenades on the besieged building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/7/283ef224-6750-4631-8ae9-e9ae3b053ba6.html Beslan Mothers Say New Video Refutes Official Version], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 30 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The film had been kept secret by the authorities for nearly three years before being officially released by the Mothers on 4 September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071223023110/http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0%2C%2C-6818114%2C00.html Video Reopens Debate Over Beslan Attack], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 31 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Beslan Mothers Release a Film Beslan Mothers Release a Film], ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', 4 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The graphic film apparently shows the prosecutors and military experts surveying the unexploded shrapnel-based bombs of the militants and structural damage in the school in Beslan shortly after the massacre. Footage shows a large hole in the wall of the sports hall, with a man saying, "The hole in the wall is not from this [kind of] explosion. Apparently someone fired [there]," adding that many victims bear no sign of shrapnel wounds. In another scene filmed next morning, a uniformed investigator points out that most of the IEDs in the school actually did not go off, and then points out a hole in the floor which he calls a "puncture of an explosive character".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/07/29/1991030.htm Beslan mothers claim truth of siege covered up], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], 29 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged FSB involvement===
Several hostage-takers, including one of the leaders, [[Vladimir Khodov]], had been previously involved in terrorist activities, but released from government custody prior to the attack despite their high profiles. According to a publication in ''Novaya Gazeta'', "the so-called Beslan terrorists were agents of our own special forces – UBOP [Center for Countering Extremism] and FSB."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2008/86/00.html Terrorists or Agents?

He said that the previously arrested terrorists only would have been freed if they were of use to the FSB, and that even in the case that they were freed without being turned into FSB assets, they would be under a strict surveillance regime that would not have allowed them to carry out the Beslan attack unnoticed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://halldor2.blogspot.com/2004/09/litvinenko-on-beslan.html A. Litvinenko: "The identities of the terrorists prove 100% the participation of the FSB in the seizure of the school in Beslan"], [[Chechenpress]], 8 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mothers of Beslan and [[Ella Kesayeva]], the hostage taking might have been an "inside job", citing the fact that the militants had planted weapons in the school prior to the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0829/p06s01-woeu.html Beslan mothers: Putin is culpable], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', 29 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, Taimuraz Chedzhemov, the lawyer representing the Mothers of Beslan, who was seeking to prosecute Russian officials over the massacre, said he had withdrawn from the case because of an anonymous death threat to his family. He said he believed the death threat was linked to a decision by the group he represented to name senior officials involved in the chaotic rescue operation whom they want put on trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-480133/Beslan-lawyer-drops-probe-death-threat.html Beslan lawyer drops probe after death threat], [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]], 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government response===
In general, the criticism was rejected by the Russian government. President Vladimir Putin specifically dismissed the foreign criticism as [[Cold War]] mentality and said that the West wants to "pull the strings so that Russia won't raise its head."&lt;ref name="silence"/&gt;

The Russian government defended the use of tanks and other heavy weaponry, arguing that it was used only after surviving hostages escaped from the school. However, this contradicts the eyewitness accounts, including by the reporters and former hostages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2007-07-31-2989316660_x.htm Video reopens debate over Beslan attack], [[Associated Press]], 31 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the survivors and other witnesses, many hostages were seriously wounded and could not possibly escape by themselves, while others were kept by the militants as human shields and moved through the building.&lt;ref name="uncovers"&gt;[http://www.markmackinnon.ca/dispatches_beslan.html MARK MacKINNON uncovers the true story of the gruesome hostage-taking at Beslan.], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 11 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deputy [[Prosecutor General of Russia]] Nikolai Shepel, acting as deputy prosecutor at the trial of Kulayev, found no fault with the security forces in handling the siege, "According to the conclusions of the investigation, the expert commission did not find any violations that could be responsible for the harmful consequences."&lt;ref name="clear"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20051228/ai_n15958745 Probe clears handling of Beslan siege], ''[[The Independent]]'', 28 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Shepel acknowledged that commandos fired flamethrowers, but said this could not have sparked the fire that caused most of the deaths;&lt;ref name="reversal"/&gt; he also said that the troops did not use [[napalm]] during the attack.&lt;ref name="mystery"/&gt;

To address doubts, Putin launched a Duma parliamentary investigation led by Alexander Torshin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=10 September 2004|url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/world/national/2004/09/10/putin_beslan040910.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018045941/http://cbc.ca/story/world/national/2004/09/10/putin_beslan040910.html|archivedate=18 October 2007|title=Putin agrees to public inquiry into Beslan siege

In 2005, previously unreleased documents by the national commission in Moscow were made available to ''[[Der Spiegel]]''. According to the paper, "instead of calling for self-criticism in the wake of the disaster, the commission recommended the Russian government to crack down harder."&lt;ref name="aftermath"/&gt;

====Dismissals and trials====
Three local top officials resigned the aftermath of the tragedy:&lt;ref group=note&gt;President Zyazikov of Ingushetia was forced to resign in 2008 but for unrelated reasons: the death of oppositionist journalist [[Magomed Yevloyev]], who was shot in police detention.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=4 September 2004|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/09/04/russia.putin/index.html|title=Putin: 'An attack on our country'|publisher=CNN|accessdate=31 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Alexander Dzasokhov, the head of North Ossetia, resigned his post on 31 May 2005, after a series of demonstrations against him in Beslan and public pressure from Mothers of Beslan on Putin to have him dismissed.&lt;ref name="rejects"&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2004/09/3744ef0e-ae76-4fb7-bf3d-610d751b76fd.html Russia: Putin Rejects Open Inquiry Into Beslan Tragedy As Critical Voices Mount], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 7 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930190421/http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2369314 Beslan mothers trust Putin, demand Dzasakhov's head], [[The Jamestown Foundation]], 24 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five Ossetian and Ingush police officers were tried in the local courts; all of them were subsequently amnestied or acquitted in 2007. As of December 2009, none of the Russian federal officials suffered consequences in connection with the Beslan events.

==Other incidents and controversies==

===Escalation of the Ingush-Ossetian hostility===

Nur-Pashi Kulayev claimed that attacking a school and targeting mothers and young children was not merely coincidental, but was deliberately designed for maximum outrage with the purpose of igniting a wider war in the Caucasus. According to Kulayev, the attackers hoped that the mostly [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Ossetians would attack their mostly Muslim Ingush and Chechen neighbours to seek revenge, encouraging ethnic and religious hatred and strife throughout the North Caucasus.&lt;ref name=mn&gt;{{cite news|first=Sanobar |last=Shermatova |title=Basayev knew there to hit |url=http://www.mn.ru/issue.php?2004-39-11 |work=[[Moskovskiye Novosti]] N39 |date=15 October 2004 |accessdate=11 September 2007 |language=ru |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018074441/http://mn.ru/issue.php?2004-39-11 |archivedate=18 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Ossetia and Ingushetia had previously been involved in a brief but bloody conflict in 1992 over disputed land in the North Ossetian [[Prigorodny District, Republic of North Ossetia–Alania|Prigorodny District]], leaving up to 1,000 dead and some 40,000 to 60,000 [[displaced person]]s, mostly Ingush.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; Indeed, shortly after the Beslan massacre, 3,000 people demonstrated in Vladikavkaz calling for revenge against the ethnic Ingush.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

The expected backlash against neighbouring nations failed to materialise on a massive scale. In one noted incident, a group of ethnic Ossetian soldiers led by a Russian officer detained two Chechen [[Spetsnaz]] soldiers and executed one of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memo.ru/eng/memhrc/texts/05bul01.shtml Armed Clashes Between Federal Military Servicemen and Personnel of Republican Security Agencies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311053502/http://www.memo.ru/eng/memhrc/texts/05bul01.shtml |date=11 March 2008 }}, [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]], January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, the office of the presidential envoy for the [[Southern Federal District]] [[Dmitry Kozak]] announced that a North Ossetian armed group engaged in abductions as retaliation for the Beslan school hostage-taking.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,692846-1,00.html Defenseless Targets], ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'', 5 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930055946/http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2007/07/1-RUS/rus-170707.asp Federal Official suggests Ingush abductions are revenge for Beslan], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 17 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; FSB Lieutenant Colonel Alikhan Kalimatov, sent from Moscow to investigate these cases, was shot dead by unidentified gunmen in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=11879203&amp;PageNum=0 High-ranking security officer killed in Ingushetia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127201500/http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=11879203&amp;PageNum=0 |date=27 January 2008 }}, [[ITAR-TASS]], 18 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grabovoy affair and the charges against Beslan activists===
In September 2005, the self-proclaimed faith healer and miracle-maker [[Grigory Grabovoy]] promised he could resurrect the murdered children. Grabovoy was arrested and indicted of fraud in April 2006, amidst the accusations that he was being used by the government as a tool to discredit the Mothers of Beslan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==International response==
{{Main article|International response to the Beslan school siege}}

The attack at Beslan was met with international abhorrence and universal condemnation. Countries and charities around the world donated to funds set up to assist the families and children that were involved in the Beslan crisis.

At the end of 2004, the [[International Foundation For Terror Act Victims]] had raised over $1.2 million with a goal of $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowhelp.org/en/faq.html | title = Frequently Asked Questions |publisher = International Foundation for Terror Act Victims |accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Israel]]i government offered help in [[psychotherapy|rehabilitating]] freed hostages, and during Russian Prime Minister [[Mikhail Fradkov]]'s visit to [[People's Republic of China|China]] in November 2005, the Chinese Health Ministry announced that they were sending doctors to Beslan, and offered free medical care to any of the victims who still needed treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=4 November 2005|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/11/2C4B7E91-6C34-40A6-BB11-573714431AD3.html|title=China To Offer Treatment To Beslan Survivors|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]]|accessdate=29 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then mayor of [[Croatia]]'s capital [[Zagreb]], [[Vlasta Pavić]], offered free vacations to the [[Adriatic|Adriatic Sea]] to the Beslan children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://beta.24sata.hr/index.php?cmd=show_clanak&amp;tekst_id=22880 |title=Bandić zabranio V.

In August 2005, two new schools were built in Beslan, paid for by the Moscow government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4161316.stm Memories haunt new Beslan schools], [[BBC News]], 18 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cine 21''''' is a movie magazine issued by ''[[The Hankyoreh|Hangyeore newspaper]]''. The magazine was first published on 14 April 1995. The first [[editor-in-chief]] was Seon-hee Cho, the culture desk journalist. The first issue was published with the articles including "Who is controlling Korean film industry", "The vote of 'Korean film power 50'". 1 August 2003, ''Cine21'' separated itself from ''Hangyeore Newspaper'' and issued a corporate body.

== Cine21 and Korean film magazine market ==
The two monthly film magazines, "Kino", issued its first number in May 1995, and "Premiere", got license permission from United States in December 1995, triggered Korean film magazine market boom. Before the two magazines, there were "Screen", issued its first number March 1984, and "Road Show". In October 1999, weekly film magazine "Preview" was published, however, it disappears after the 4th issue. The film magazine market transformed its type as a weekly magazine from monthly magazine through the appearance of "Cine Bus", issued its first number on 2 September 2000, and "Film 2.0" started on 19 December 2000. In the year 2001, "Movie Week" set their price to 1000 Won and centered public's attention. The weekly magazines became active throughout the market, however, the monthly magazines kept on downsizing. To the last, the first movie magazine "Kino" has ceased publication in 2003 and "Road Show" also discontinued in 2003. "Premiere" changed its type to two-weekly publishing magazine. The only monthly film magazine "Screen" discontinued in 2010, December. "Movie Week" merged with "Magazine M", running by Joongang Newspaper, one of the biggest press in Korea. Nowadays, only two film magazines are on the road : "Cine 21" and "Magazine M".

A '''cockfight''' is a [[blood sport]] between two [[cock (bird)|cock]]s, or '''gamecocks''', held in a ring called a cockpit. The history of raising fowl for fighting goes back 6,000 years. The first documented use of the ''word'' gamecock, denoting use of the [[cock (bird)|cock]] as to a "[[game]]", a [[sport]], [[pastime]] or [[entertainment]], was recorded in 1634,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gamecock |title=gamecock |quote=First Known Use: 1634|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the term "cock of the game" used by George Wilson, in the earliest known book on the sport of cockfighting in ''The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting'' in 1607. But it was during [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]'s [[Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation|voyage of discovery]] of the Philippines in 1521 when modern cockfighting was first witnessed and documented by [[Antonio Pigafetta]], Magellan's chronicler, in the kingdom of [[Taytay, Palawan|Taytay]].

The combatants, referred to as gamecocks (not to be confused with [[game bird]]s), are specially [[bred]] and conditioned for increased stamina and strength. Male and female [[chicken]]s of such a [[breed]] are referred to as '''game fowl'''.

Cocks possess congenital [[aggression]] toward all males of the same [[species]]. Wagers are often made on the outcome of the match.

Cockfighting is a blood sport due in some part to the physical trauma the cocks inflict on each other, which is sometimes increased by attaching metal spurs to the cocks' natural spurs. While not all fights are to the death, the cocks may endure significant physical trauma. In some areas around the world, cockfighting is still practiced as a mainstream event; in some countries it is regulated by law, or forbidden outright. Advocates of the "age old sport"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Raymond Hernandez |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/11/nyregion/blood-sport-gets-blood-fans-cockfighting-don-t-understand-its-outlaw-status.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=A Blood Sport Gets in the Blood; Fans of Cockfighting Don't Understand Its Outlaw Status |work=The New York Times |location=New York City Metropolitan Area |date=1995-04-11 |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ksfa860.com/east-east-texas-lawmaker-wants-to-outlaw-cockfighting/ |title=East Texas Lawmaker Wants to Outlaw Cockfighting |author=Jim Bell|publisher=[[KSFA 860 AM]] NewsTalk|date= February 24, 2011|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; often list cultural and religious relevance as reasons for perpetuation of cockfighting as a sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keys|first=Janette|title=Cock Fights / Peleas de Gallos|url=http://www.colonialzone-dr.com/pastimes-cock_fighting.html|publisher=Guide to [[Colonial Zone Dominican Republic]]|date=2011|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
Two owners place their gamecock in the cockpit. The cocks fight until ultimately one of them dies or is critically injured. Historically, this was in a ''cockpit'', a term which was also used in the 16th century to mean a place of [[entertainment]] or frenzied activity. [[William Shakespeare]] used the term in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' to specifically mean the area around the stage of a [[theatre]]. In Tudor times, the [[Palace of Westminster]] had a permanent cockpit, called the [[Cockpit-in-Court]].

== History ==
[[File:Cockfight Santangelo MAN Napoli.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|In this [[Roman mosaic|ancient Roman mosaic]], two cocks face off in front of a table displaying the purse for the winner between a [[caduceus]] and a [[Palm branch (symbol)|palm of victory]] ''([[National Archaeological Museum of Naples]])'']]
Cockfighting is an ancient spectator sport. There is evidence that cockfighting was a pastime in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].&lt;ref name=Sherman&gt;Sherman, David M. (2002). ''Tending Animals in the Global Village''. Blackwell Publishing. 46. {{ISBN|0-683-18051-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Encyclopædia Britannica (2008) holds:&lt;ref&gt;''Cockfighting''. Encyclopædia Britannica 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The sport was popular in ancient times in India, China, Persia, and other Eastern countries and was introduced into Ancient Greece in the time of Themistocles (c. 524–460&amp;nbsp;BC). For a long time the Romans affected to despise this "Greek diversion", but they ended up adopting it so enthusiastically that the agricultural writer Columella (1st century AD) complained that its devotees often spent their whole patrimony in betting at the side of the pit.}}

Based on his analysis of a Mohenjo-daro seal, Iravatham Mahadevan speculates that the city's ancient name could have been Kukkutarma ("the city [-rma] of the cockerel [kukkuta]").&lt;ref&gt;[[Iravatham Mahadevan]]. [http://www.thehindu.com/multimedia/archive/00151/Dr_Iravatham_Mahade_151204a.pdf "'Address' Signs of the Indus Script" (PDF)]. Presented at the [[World Classical Tamil Conference 2010]]. 23–27 June 2010.

Crawford – Elsevier Health Sciences, 1990, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a recent study,&lt;ref&gt;Al-Nasser, A. et al. (June 2007) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S004393390700147X "Overview of chicken taxonomy and domestication".], ''World's Poultry Science Journal'' 63: 285–300.)&lt;/ref&gt; "it is not known whether these birds made much contribution to the modern domestic fowl. Chickens from the [[Harrapa|Harappan]] culture of the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] (2500–2100 BC) may have been the main source of diffusion throughout the world." "Within the Indus Valley, indications are that chickens were used for sport and not for food" (Zeuner 1963)&lt;ref name="google11"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMSF7m2CFTEC&amp;pg=PA11 |title=''Poultry Breeding and Genetics'' |author=R.

Some additional insight into the pre-history of European and American secular cockfighting may be taken from ''The London Encyclopaedia'':

{{Quote|At first cockfighting was partly a religious and partly a political institution at Athens; and was continued for improving the seeds of valor in the minds of their youth, but was afterwards perverted both there and in the other parts of Greece to a common pastime, without any political or religious intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54BMAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA113|title=The London Encyclopaedia: Or, Universal Dictionary of Science, Art, Literature, and Practical Mechanics, Comprising a Popular View of the Present State of Knowledge.

[[File:Hahnenkampf 2.jpg|thumb|Spurs taped and tied onto legs]]

In some regional variations, the birds are equipped with either metal spurs (called ''gaffs'') or knives, tied to the leg in the area where the bird's natural spur has been partially removed. A ''cockspur'' is a bracelet (often made of leather) with a curved, sharp spike which is attached to the leg of the bird. The spikes typically range in length from "short spurs" of just over an inch to "long spurs" almost two and a half inches long. In the highest levels of 17th century English cockfighting, the spikes were made of silver. The sharp spurs have been known to injure or even kill the bird handlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/rooster_revenge_cockfighting_bird_vdWgYmiTQbLmMBltVoPmxK |title=Cockfighting bird stabs, kills man |work=The New York Post |publisher=Nypost.com |date=2011-02-06 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1348653/Indian-police-hunt-killer-rooster-slashes-owners-throat.html |title=Champion rooster slashes its owner's throat for being asked to fight once too often |work=UK Daily Mail |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2011-01-21 |accessdate=2014-02-11 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''naked heel'' variation, the bird's natural spurs are left intact and sharpened: fighting is done without gaffs or taping, particularly in India (especially in [[Tamil Nadu]]).

==== Brazil ====

Cockfighting, known in Brazil as ''rinha de galos'', was banned in 1934 with the help of President [[Getúlio Vargas]] through Brazil's 1934 constitution, passed on 16 July. Based on the recognition of animals in the Constitution, a Brazilian Supreme Court ruling resulted in the ban of animal related activities that involve claimed "animal suffering such as cockfighting, and a tradition practiced in southern Brazil, known as 'Farra do Boi' (the Oxen Festival)",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animallaw.info/nonus/articles/ovbrazil.htm |title=Overview of Brazil's Legal Structure for Animal Issues – Lane Azevedo Clayton – Animal Legal &amp; Historical Center = Publish Date: 2011 |publisher=Animallaw.info |date= |accessdate=2014-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731075539/http://www.animallaw.info/nonus/articles/ovbrazil.htm |archivedate=2013-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "animals also have the right to legal protection against mistreatment and suffering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joinuniverse.com/brazilian-animal-law/ |title=Brazilian animal law – Alex P |publisher=JoinUniverse |date=2012-06-19 |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== India ====
[[File:COCK FIGHT.JPG|thumb|Cockfight in Tamil Nadu, India]]
Cockfighting (''Kodi Pandem'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]])   (''Kori katta'' in [[Tulu language|Tulu]]) (''Vetrukkaal seval porr'' in [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil]] which means "naked heel cockfight") is a favourite sport of people living in the coastal region of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Dakshina Kannada]] and [[Udupi district|Udupi]] districts of [[Tulu Nadu]] region of [[Karnataka]], and the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], India. Three- or four-inch blades (''Bal'' in [[Tulu language|Tulu]]) are attached to the cocks' legs. Knockout fights to the death are widely practised in [[Andhra Pradesh]]. In [[Tamil Nadu]], the winner is decided after three or four rounds. People watch with intense interest surrounding the cocks. The sport has gradually become a gambling [[sport]].

In [[Jharkhand]] the cockfighting game is known as 'pada' and the spurs are called 'kant' lots of people enjoy the game, the cockpit is called 'chhad' person in the cockpit or who ties the spurs is called 'kantkar'.

In the Tamil Nadu districts of [[Chennai district|Chennai]], [[Thanjavur district|Tanjore]], [[Tiruchirappalli district|Trichy]] and [[Salem district|Salem]], only the 'naked heel' variation is permitted. In [[Erode district|Erode]], [[Thiruppur district|Thiruppur]], [[Karur district|Karur]] and [[Coimbatore district|Coimbatore]] districts, only bloody blade fights are conducted. During festival seasons, this is the major game for men. Women normally don't participate. Only the Pure breeds are chosen to the fight. Naked heel cocks Fight for long duration compared with Blade fight cocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tamil-desiyam.com/seval-sandai-in-tamil/|title=Seval Sandai in Tamil - Tamil Desiyam|date=2018-08-14|work=Tamil Desiyam|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The cockfight, or more accurately expressed the [[secular]] cockfight, is an intense [[sport]], [[recreation]], or [[pastime]] to some, while to others, the cockfight remains an ancient [[religious]] [[ritual]], a [[sacred]] [[ceremony]] (i.e. a [[religious]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] cockfight) associated with the ‘daivasthanams’ (temples) and held at the temples precincts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/article1175873.ece |title=Police move against cockfight faces opposition|work= [[The Hindu]] |date=January 10, 2008| accessdate=May 24, 2017|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2012 at India's 'Sun God' Festival the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) district committee, demanded that police not interfere in the cockfighting known as ‘kozhi kettu’ as it is a part of the [[temple]] [[rituals]], while the police replied they would not interfere if the cockfight is held at a temple.&lt;ref&gt;Justin, Denise A (January 9, 2012).

Cockfighting is a very old [[tradition]] in [[Balinese Hinduism]], the Batur Bang Inscriptions I (from the year 933) and the Batuan Inscription (dated 944 on the Balinese Caka calendar) disclose that the ''tabuh rah'' ritual has existed for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/01/23/bali039s-cockfighting-tradition-lives.html |title=Bali-Cockfighting Tradition Lives |work=The Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta, Indonesia |publisher=Thejakartapost.com |date=2002-01-24 |accessdate=2014-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225114512/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/01/23/bali039s-cockfighting-tradition-lives.html |archivedate=2014-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bali]], cockfights, known as ''tajen'', are practiced in an ancient religious purification [[ritual]] to expel evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Bali Today: Love and social life, By Jean Couteau, Jean Couteau et al., p128-129, Kepustakaan Populer Gramedia, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This ritual, a form of [[animal sacrifice]], is called ''tabuh rah'' ("pouring blood").&lt;ref&gt;Bali, Sekala and Niskala: Essays on society, tradition, and craft, Fred B. Eiseman – page 240 – Periplus Editions, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of tabuh rah is to provide an offering (the blood of the losing chicken) to the evil spirits. Cockfighting is a religious obligation at every Balinese temple festival or religious ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Bali, Sekala and Niskala, Vol. 2: Essays on Society, Tradition, and Craft, Fred B. Eiseman Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; Cockfights without a religious purpose are considered [[gambling]] in Indonesia, although it is still largely practiced in many parts of Indonesia. Women are generally not involved in the tabuh rah process. The tabuh rah process is held on the largest pavilion in a Balinese temple complex, the [[wantilan]].

The American anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] published his most famous work, ''[[Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight|Notes on the Balinese Cockfight]]'', on the practice of cockfights in Bali. In it, he argued that the cockfight served as a pastiche or model of wider Balinese society from which judgments about other aspects of the culture could be drawn.

==== Iraq ====

Cockfighting is illegal but widespread in Iraq. The attendees come to gamble or just for the entertainment. A rooster can cost up to $8,000. The most-prized birds are called Harati, which means that they are of Turkish or Indian origin, and have muscular legs and necks.&lt;ref name="Your Middle East"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/news/cockfighting-in-iraq-a-different-kind-of-battle_6031 |title=Cockfighting in Iraq: a different kind of battle |publisher=Yourmiddleeast.com |date=2012-04-11 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cock Fight Arina Davao.jpg|thumbnail|Cockfight in [[Davao City]]]]
Cockfighting, locally termed ''Sabong'', is a popular pastime in the [[Philippines]], where both illegal and legal cockfights occur. Legal cockfights are held in cockpits every week, whilst illegal ones, called ''tupada'' or ''tigbakay'', are held in secluded cockpits where authorities cannot raid them. In both types, knives or ''gaffs'' are used. There are two kinds of knives used in Philippine cockfighting: single-edged blades (used in derbies) and double-edged blades; lengths of knives also vary. All knives are attached on the left leg of the bird, but depending on agreement between owners, blades can be attached on the right or even on both legs. ''Sabong'' and illegal ''tupada'', are judged by a referee called ''sentensyador'' or ''koyme'', whose verdict is final and not subject to any appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/video/25601/Emergency-'Sentensyador' |title=Emergency: 'Sentensyador' |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-07-12 |accessdate=2014-02-11 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403020911/http://www.gmanews.tv/video/25601/Emergency-'Sentensyador' |archivedate=2010-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bets are usually taken by the ''kristo'', so named because of his outstretched hands when calling out wagers from the audience and skillfully doing so purely from memory.

==== Cuba ====
Cockfighting was so common during the Cuban colonization by [[Spain]], that there were arenas in every urban and rural town. The first official known document about cockfighting in Cuba dates from 1737. It is a royal decree asking, to the governor of the island, a report about the inconveniences that might cause cockfights "with the people from land and sea" and asking for information about rentals of the games. The Spaniard [[Miguel Tacón y Rosique|Miguel Tacón]], Lieutenant General and governor of the colony, banned cockfighting by a decree dated on October 20, 1835, limiting these spectacles only to holidays.

In 1844 a decree dictated by the Captain General of the island, [[:es:Leopoldo O'Donnell]], forbade to non-white people the attendance to these shows. During the second half of the 19th century many authorizations were conceded for building arenas, until General [[:es:Juan Rius Rivera]], then civilian governor in Havana, prohibited cockfighting by a decree of October 31, 1899, and later the Cuban governor, General [[Leonard Wood]], dictated the military order no. 165 prohibiting cockfights in the whole country since June 1, 1900.&lt;ref name="pupo"&gt;Agustín Pupo Domenech, El Gallo Fino Cubano, 151 pp. Editorial SI-MAR, S.A., La Habana, Cuba 1995 ({{ISBN|9597054051}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 20th century, legality of cockfights suffered several ups and downs.&lt;ref&gt;Revista Carteles, September 2, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 the then Cuban president [[:es:José Miguel Gómez|José Miguel Gómez]], with the intention to gain followers, allowed cockfights once again, and then regulations were agreed for the fights.&lt;ref&gt;Reglamento para las lidias de gallos, Ayuntamiento de Holguín, Cuba 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to beginnings of 1968 cockfights used to be held everywhere in the country, but with the purpose of stopping the bets, the arenas were closed and the fights forbidden by the authorities. In 1980 authorities legalized cockfights again and a state business organization was created with the participation of the private breeders, grouped in territories. Every year the state organization announces several national tournaments from January to April, makes trade shows and sells fighting cocks to clients from other Caribbean countries.&lt;ref name="pupo" /&gt;

==== Dominican Republic ====
In the Dominican Republic, cockfighting is both legal and very popular. There is at least one arena (''gallera)'' in every town whereas in bigger cities larger ''coliseos'' can be found.  Important fights are broadcast on television and newspapers have dedicated pages to cock fights and the different ''trabas'', the local name for gamefowl breeding grounds. Those dedicated to the breeding and training of fighting cocks are called ''galleros''  or ''traberos''. The cocks are often outfitted with special spurs made from various materials (ranging from plastic to metal or even [[Hawksbill sea turtle|carey]] shell) and fights are typically to the death. Public perception of the sport is as normal as that of baseball or any other major sport. 

==== United States ====

In the United States, cockfighting is now illegal in all fifty [[U.S. state]]s and the [[District of Columbia]]. The last state to implement a [[state law]] banning cockfighting was [[Louisiana]]; the [[Louisiana State Legislature]] voted to approve a ban in June 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wafb.com/Global/story.asp?S=6493974 |title=Louisiana State House passes Cockfighting ban |publisher=Wafb.com |date=2014-02-04 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which went into effect in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/lavoz/spanish/us/articles/us_123936.html Legisladores de Luisiana aprueban prohibición a pelea de gallos] June 27, 2007 [[La Voz (Phoenix)|La Voz]] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013:
*Cockfighting is a [[felony]] in 40 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="2013Chart"&gt;[http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/animal_fighting/cockfighting_chart_2013.pdf Fact Sheet: Cockfighting: State Laws], Humane Society of the United States (updated April 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The possession of birds for fighting is prohibited in 39 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="2013Chart"/&gt;
*Being a spectator at a cockfight is prohibited in 43 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="2013Chart"/&gt;
*The possession of cockfighting implements is prohibited in 15 states.&lt;ref name="2013Chart"/&gt;

Additionally, the [[Agricultural Act of 2014|2014 farm bill]], signed into law by President Obama, contained a provision making it a federal crime to attend an animal fighting event or bring a child under the age of 16 to an animal fighting event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=HSLF |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/news_briefs/2014/02/farm_bill_passed_020414.html|title=Farm Bill Strengthens Animal Fighting Law, Maintains State Farm Animal Protection Laws|publisher=Humane Society of the United States|date=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cockfighting remains legal in the [[United States territories]] of Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands. Legislation introduced in Congress (the Parity in Animal Cruelty Enforcement (PACE) Act) would bar animal fighting in the territories, but has not been enacted.&lt;ref&gt;Gina Ender, [https://signalscv.com/2017/11/congress-combats-cockfighting-dogfighting-u-s-territories-new-bill/ Congress combats cockfighting, dogfighting in U.S. territories with new bill], ''Santa Clarita Valley Signal'' (November 2, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Puerto Rico]], cockfighting is popular and is considered a "national sport"; according to a [[National Park Service]] report, it generates about $100 million annually. There are some 200,000 fighting birds annually on the island. Puerto Rico's Cockfighting Commission regulates 87 clubs, but many non-government sanctioned "underground" cockfighting operations exist.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith Hoffman, [https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mvxy73/cockfighting-is-puerto-ricos-most-resilient-industry Cockfighting is Puerto Rico's Most Resilient Industry], Vice (February 16, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act, a [[federal law]] that made it a federal crime to transfer cockfighting implements across [[Commerce Clause|state or national borders]] and increasing the penalty for violations of federal animal fighting laws to three years in prison became law in 2007. It passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] 368–39 and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] by [[unanimous consent]] and was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-137|title=H.R. 137: Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007|accessdate=February 22, 2008|publisher=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] was amended again in 2008 when provisions were included in the [[2008 Farm Bill]] (P.L. 110-246). These provisions tightened prohibitions on dog and other animal fighting activities, and increase penalties for violation of the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RS22493.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426032912/http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RS22493.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-26 |df= }} The Animal Welfare Act: Background and Selected Legislation by Tadlock Cowan – Analyst in Natural Resources and Rural Development – September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Major law enforcement raids against cockfighting occurred in February 2014 in [[New York (state)|New York State]] (when 3,000 birds were seized and nine men were charged with felony  [[animal-fighting]] in "Operation Angry Birds, the state's largest-ever cockfighting bust)&lt;ref name="Antenucci-NY"&gt;{{cite news|last=Antenucci|first=Antonio|title=70 arrested in NY’s largest cockfighting bust|url=https://nypost.com/2014/02/10/70-arrested-in-new-yorks-largest-ever-cockfighting-bust/|accessdate=10 February 2014|newspaper=New York Post|date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Assefa-NY"&gt;{{cite news|last=Assefa|first=Haimy|title=New York cockfighting bust uncovers 3,000 birds and yields 9 arrests|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/09/justice/new-york-cockfighting-bust/|accessdate=10 February 2014|date=10 February 2014|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite news|title=NY AG: 3,000 Birds Rescued in Cockfighting Bust|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ny-ag-3000-birds-rescued-cockfighting-bust-22436902|accessdate=10 February 2014|newspaper=ABC News|date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in May 2017 in California (when the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] seized 7,000 cockfighting birds at a ranch in [[Val Verde, California]], one of the largest cockfighting busts in U.S. history).&lt;ref name="latimes7000birdsseizedinlargest"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hamilton|first1=Matt|title=7,000 birds seized in largest cockfighting bust in U.S. history, L.A.

=== Europe ===

==== France ====
Holding cockfights is a crime in France, but there is an exemption under subparagraph 3 of article 521–1 of the [[Law enforcement in France|French penal code]] for cockfights and bullfights in locales where an uninterrupted tradition exists for them. Thus, cockfighting is allowed in the [[Nord-Pas de Calais]] region, where it takes place in a small number of towns including [[Raimbeaucourt]], [[La Bistade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article717208.ece| title=British fans flock to French cockfights|publisher=The Times|author1=Foggo, D.  |author2=Campbell, M.|date=January 22, 2006|accessdate=February 22, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other villages around [[Lille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guide-nord-pas-calais.com/les_combats_et_concours_de_coqs_dans_le_nord_pas_de_calais.htm|title=Le Guide bu Nord de Pas de Calais|language=French|accessdate=February 22, 2008|publisher=Region Nord Pas de calais|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205214105/http://www.guide-nord-pas-calais.com/les_combats_et_concours_de_coqs_dans_le_nord_pas_de_calais.htm|archivedate=February 5, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the construction of new cockfighting areas is prohibited, a law upheld by the [[Constitutional Council of France]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="BanArenas"&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20150731-france-highest-court-upholds-ban-new-cockfighting-arenas French court upholds ban on new cockfighting arenas], France24 (July 31, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cockfighting is also legal in some [[French Overseas Territories]].&lt;ref name="BanArenas"/&gt;

==== Spain ====
Cockfighting is banned in Spain except in two [[Spanish regions]]: the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Andalusia]]. Spain's Animal Protection Law of 1991 recognizes an exception for these regions based on cultural heritage and a history of cockfighting in the region.&lt;ref name="Spain"&gt;Octavio Toledo, [https://elpais.com/elpais/2015/02/16/inenglish/1424081935_993566.html Cockfighting ban for Canary Islands fizzles out in Congress], ''El País'' (February 16, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ortega"&gt;Aleksin H.

==== United Kingdom ====
Cockfighting was banned outright in [[England and Wales]] and in the [[British Overseas Territories]] with the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1835]]. Sixty years later, in 1895, cockfighting was also banned in [[Scotland]], where it had been relatively common in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jKjYyGF8hSwC|title=Encyclopedia of Traditional British Rural Sports |author=Collins, T.|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=December 5, 2007|year=2005 | isbn=978-0-415-35224-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Hawk and Buckle Inn cockpit|reconstructed cockpit from Denbigh]] in North Wales may be found at [[St Fagans National History Museum]] in [[Cardiff]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/stfagans/buildings/cockpit/?display_mode=mobile|title=Cockpit|publisher=National Museum Wales|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a reference exists in 1774 to a cockpit at [[Stanecastle]] in Scotland.&lt;ref name="McClure"&gt;{{cite book|author=McClure, David |year=1994|title=Tolls and Tacksmen|publisher=Ayr Arch &amp; Nat Hist Soc.

The '''Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity''' was adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by [[United Nations]] [[UNGA|General Assembly]] resolution 2391 (XXIII) of 26 November 1968.
Pursuant to the provisions of its Article VIII (90 days following the deposit of the tenth ratification), it came into force on 11 November 1970.

The Convention provides that no signatory state may apply [[statutory limitations]] to:
*[[War crimes]] as they are defined in the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal|Charter of the]] [[Nürnberg]] [[International Military Tribunal]] of 8 August 1945.
*[[Crimes against humanity]], whether committed in time of war or in time of peace, as defined in the Charter of the Nürnberg International Military Tribunal, eviction by armed attack or occupation, inhuman acts resulting from the policy of [[apartheid]], and the crime of [[genocide]] as defined in the 1948 [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].

As of January 2015, the Convention has 55 state parties, which includes 54 [[UN member states]] and the [[State of Palestine]].

The '''Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatsko narodno kazalište u Zagrebu}}), commonly referred to as '''HNK Zagreb''', is a theatre, opera and ballet house located in [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g294454-d316417-Reviews-Croatian_National_Theatre_in_Zagreb-Zagreb.html | title=Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb | publisher=[[TripAdvisor]] | accessdate=4 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The theatre evolved out of the first city theatre built in 1836 housed in the present-day [[Old City Hall (Zagreb)|Old City Hall]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The theatre was first established as the ''Croatian National Theatre'' in 1860, and in 1861 it gained government support putting it on par with many other European national theatres. In 1870 an opera company was added to the theatre and in 1895 it moved to the new purpose-built building on [[Republic of Croatia Square]] in Zagreb's [[Donji grad (Zagreb)|Lower Town]], where it is based today.

Austro-Hungarian emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] was at the unveiling of this new building during his [[1895 visit of Emperor Franz Joseph to Zagreb|visit to the city in 1895]].&lt;ref name="Povijest zgrade"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hnk.hr/o-kazalistu/ozgradi/povijest-zgrade-2/|title=Povijest zgrade|work=hnk.hr|publisher=Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|language=Croatian|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The building itself was the project of famed Viennese architects [[Ferdinand Fellner]] and [[Herman Helmer]], whose firm had built several theatres in Vienna. Celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of the building were held on October 14, 1995.

At the entrance of the theatre is located the wall fountain ''The Source of Life'' (''Zdenac života''), designed by Croatian artist and sculptor [[Ivan Meštrović]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vijesti.hrt.hr/209430/mestrovicev-zdenac-zivota-izlozen-u-splitu|title=Meštrovićev "Zdenac života" izložen u Splitu|date=3 May 2013|work=vijesti.hrt.hr|publisher=[[Croatian Radiotelevision]]|language=hr|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Croatia's leading artist have worked at the theatre.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Its first [[Management|manager]] and [[dramatist]] was the [[Greek people|Greek]]–[[Croatian people|Croatian]] poet [[Dimitrija Demeter]], a leading activist of the [[Croatian national revival]] movement, with [[Ivan Zajc]] as first conductor. [[Jakov Gotovac]] was the Theatre's opera conductor from 1923 to 1958. The famous Croatian theatre director [[Branko Gavella]] began his career here, as did the first Croatian [[Ballerina|prima ballerina]] [[Mia Čorak Slavenska]].

The theatre has also seen many international artists including [[Franz Liszt]], [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[Franz Lehár]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Gérard Philipe]], [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Jean-Louis Barrault]], [[Peter Brook]], [[Mario Del Monaco]], [[José Carreras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hnk.hr/o-kazalistu/povijest/povijest/|title=Povijest|work=hnk.hr|publisher=Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|language=Croatian|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also Croatian National Theatres in [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Croatian National Theatre Ivan pl. Zajc in Rijeka|Rijeka]], [[Osijek]], [[Varaždin]] and [[Zadar]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

'''Daedongyeojido''' (also '''Daedong yeojido''', {{lang-ko|대동여지도, 大東輿地圖}}, lit. "The Great Map of the East Land") is a large scale map of Korea produced by [[Joseon dynasty]] cartographer and geologist [[Kim Jeong-ho]] in 1861.&lt;ref name="nmkip"/&gt; A second edition was printed in 1864.&lt;ref name=nmkip/&gt; One source describes it as the "oldest map in Korea".&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; Daedongyeojido is considered very advanced for its time, and marks the zenith of pre-modern Korean cartography.&lt;ref name=nmkip/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:DaedongyeojidoUlleungdo.png|thumb|right|250px|"Daedongyeojido" (1861) Ulleungdo and Usan]]
The map consists of 22 separate, foldable booklets, each covering approximately {{convert|47|km}} (north-south) by {{convert|31.5|km}} (east–west). Combined, they form a map of Korea that is {{convert|6.7|m}} wide and {{convert|3.8|m}} long.&lt;ref name=nmkip/&gt; The scale of the map is 1:162,000.&lt;ref name="Territorial map of the Great East 1861 :: American Geographical Society Library Digital Map Collection"/&gt; The map was printed from 70  [[basswood]] [[woodblocks]], engraved on both sides.&lt;ref name=nmkip/&gt; The techniques to create the map have been described as a hybrid of Korean and Western methods.&lt;ref name="Short2012"/&gt;

The map is praised for precise delineations of mountain ridges, waterways, and transportation routes. It also has markings for settlements, including villages, as well as notable administrative and cultural areas and sites, such as past and present government offices and military sites, public warehouses, government horse ranches, beacon fire mounds, and royal tombs.&lt;ref name=nmkip/&gt;&lt;ref name=kdata/&gt;

Several versions of the map exist, with some variations (such as the number of booklets, either 21 or 22). The map was accompanied by a preface explaining the methodology, and a legend, as well as additional statistics, and a separate map for the Korean capital of [[Seoul]].&lt;ref name="kdata"/&gt;

==100,000-won banknote controversy==
In 2008 the map was considered as an image for one of the 100,000-[[South Korean won|won]] [[banknote]]s, which would have been the highest-denomination South Korean banknote to date. However, the map of Daedongyeojido did not portray the internationally disputed [[Liancourt Rocks]] (known as Dokdo islands in Korea), and the ensuing public debate in Korea over whether the map on a banknote should be changed to include them made the image too controversial for such a high-visibility placement.&lt;ref name="Arirang News :: BOK to Put Dokdo on New 100,000 Won Bill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Chosun Ilbo (English Edition): Daily News from Korea - Dokdo Issue Delays New W100,000 Notes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="No Banknote Would Be Complete Without Dokdo"/&gt; Eventually, the 100,000-won banknote was cancelled due to the controversy stirred by the issue.&lt;ref name="50,000-Won Banknote to Be Issued in May"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Debut of W100,000 Note Delayed Indefinitely"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SKorea shelves new banknote"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4185">{{italictitle}}'''''Die Eroberung von Mexico''''' (''The Conquest of Mexico'') is an [[opera]] in four acts by [[Wolfgang Rihm]], premiered in [[Hamburg]] on 9 February 1992.

==Libretto and concept==
The [[libretto]], by the composer, is based on [[Antonin Artaud]]'s 1932 text, ''La conquête du Mexique'', but also included elements of Artaud's ''Le théâtre de Séraphin'' and of poetry by [[Octavio Paz]] (his 1937 poem, "The Root of Man"). The work also cites an Aztec poem believed to be from the early 16th century, originally written in [[Nahuatl]]. The opera, which Rihm himself refers to as a 'music-drama', centres on the encounter between the invader [[Hernán Cortés|Cortez]] and the [[Aztec]] ruler [[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]], which was conceived by Rihm as 'an encounter with the Self'. Montezuma (sung by a [[soprano]]) has his words echoed by two other female voices offstage, whilst those of Cortez are echoed by two speaking roles.&lt;ref name="Arseni"&gt; Arseni (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2004), 244-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
===Act I - ''Die Vorzeichen (The Omens)''===
Cortez arrives in Mexico and determines to conquer it; Montezuma presages disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2004), 245&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act II - ''Bekenntnis (Declaration)''===
Cortez enters the empty city - he begins to doubt his own reality. Meeting Montezuma, Cortez's attempts at communication break down. He taunts Montezuma's idol worship, whilst Montezuma realizes that the Spaniards are only after gold. [[La Malinche]] (danced role), (who was in fact the interpreter between the two), fails to re-establish dialogue.

===Act III - ''Die Umwälzungen (The Convulsions)''===
Montezuma is increasingly mentally disturbed. Cortez produces a screaming man who enters Montezuma's body. In torment, Montezuma delivers a long address in which his two 'alternative' voices and the female choir also join.

===Act IV - ''Die Abdankung (The Abdication)''===
Montezuma has died: Cortez dreams before his statue and experiences a dissolution of his own personality. Montezuma's funeral commences and this sparks off the Aztecs and Spaniards to massacre each other (an event which did not take place in history). The male and female choruses chant the ancient Nahuatl poem. When all are dead, the voices of Cortez and Montezuma are heard in duet for the first time, singing the last verse of the poem by Paz.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2004), 246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performances==
The opera has been performed in Cologne, Madrid and Frankfurt,&lt;ref name = "universal"/&gt; and, in 2015, at the [[Salzburg Festival]].&lt;ref name="Arseni"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2089">'''Eskatrol''' was an [[amphetamine]] [[weight loss]] agent which was removed by the U.S. 
[[Food and Drug Administration]] in 1981 after its manufacturer,&lt;ref name=banned/&gt;
[[SmithKline &amp; French]],&lt;ref name=product&gt;''Advertising:Menley &amp; James Turns To Love 1969 Style, January 26, 1969, Page F16.&lt;/ref&gt; was unable to prove the drug's effectiveness. At the time it was among the 200 most widely prescribed drugs in the [[United States]]. Another was [[Dexamyl]] tablets.&lt;ref name=banned&gt;''U.S. Review of Prescription Drugs Ends'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 16, 1984, Page 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Eskatrol contained [[dextroamphetamine sulfate]]&lt;ref&gt;''Pharmacist Arrested on Drug Charge'', [[Los Angeles Times]], July 16, 1975, Page A3.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[prochlorperazine]].

In August 1970 the F.D.A. sought to limit the use of [[stimulants]] by calling for changes in labeling which decreased the number of allowable claims and intensified the warnings about possible hazards. F.D.A. Commissioner,
Charles C. Edwards, criticized the drug industry for not helping to prevent the abuse of amphetamines. Thomas M. Rauch, president of SmithKline &amp; French laboratories, responded that his company had long promoted stricter drug abuse legislation and tighter controls
on production and distribution. SmithKline &amp; French also made [[Dexedrine]] and [[Benzedrine]]. The F.D.A. began to restrict amphetamine manufacturer claims to only three medical uses, two of them uncommon. The two rare conditions specified were [[narcolepsy]]
and [[hyperactivity]]. The third permitted use was for suppressing appetite among persons who needed to lose weight. However, this would only be allowed for a total of a few weeks, and as a part of
treatment for obesity.&lt;ref&gt;''Pep Pill Makers Accused By F.D.A.'', ''The New York Times'', August 6, 1970, Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Faxlore''' is a sort of [[folklore]]: [[humor]]ous texts, [[folk poetry]], [[folk art]], and  [[urban legend]]s that are circulated, not by word of mouth, but by [[fax machine]].  '''Xeroxlore''' or '''photocopylore''' is similar material circulated by [[photocopying]]; compare [[samizdat]] in [[Soviet-bloc]] countries.

The first use of the term '''xeroxlore''' was in [[Michael J. Preston (professor of English)|Michael J. Preston]]'s essay ''Xerox-lore'', 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Photocopylore" is perhaps the most frequently encountered name for the phenomenon now, because of [[trademark]] concerns involving the [[Xerox]] Corporation.  The first use of this term came in ''A Dictionary of English Folklore'' by [[Jacqueline Simpson]] and [[Steve Roud]].&lt;ref&gt;(Oxford University Press: 2000; {{ISBN|0-19-860766-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Material circulated in faxlore==
Some faxlore is relatively harmless.  [[Cartoon]]s and [[joke]]s often circulate as faxlore, the poor graphic quality becoming worse with each new person who resends the joke to the next recipient. Because faxlore and xeroxlore is the (mis)appropriation of [[technology]] owned by the employer, much [[humour|humorous]] faxlore is mildly subversive of the workplace and its values.  Like [[email]] and [[chain letters]], office technology has given new life to various forms of practical jokes, [[urban legends]], and folklore.  The items are often office-related, such as spoof agenda for meetings, spurious descriptions of ridiculous training programs that all staff will allegedly be required to attend, and so on.  Names may be whited out and replaced with someone in the office, making it a joke on a particular person, or details may be altered making an item more topical.&lt;ref&gt;Michael, 1995; Dundes, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The semi-traditional lists of reasons "why a cucumber is better than a man" or "why a beer is better than a woman" often circulate as faxlore, as has the well known [[mock German]] variations of the "[[Blinkenlights]]" poster.  Another commonly circulated text contains [[ethnic humor]]; a typical version goes:

:Heaven is where the police are British, the lovers French, the mechanics German, the chefs Italian, and it is all organized by the Swiss.

:Hell is where the police are German, the lovers Swiss, the mechanics French, the chefs British, and it is all organized by the Italians.

Materials of this sort have existed from the beginnings of duplicating technologies.  [[World War II]] era [[blueprint]]s exist of drawings of female nudes with their body parts labeled as if they were the parts of airplanes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} With the widespread adoption of photocopying, amateur duplication of this sort of material became available to a much larger social base.  Cartoons and other amateur materials were distributed in the workplace, usually in violation of [[business management|managerial]] restrictions on the use of office supplies, and often in disregard of [[copyright]] law.&lt;ref name="Preston, 1996"&gt;Preston, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during the early 1990s, the widespread adoption of telecopiers made it possible to duplicate these materials remotely.  The use of a fax machine  to duplicate these materials also changed the emphases of their subjects; various alarms and urban legends were propagated to distant readers over the telephone lines.  This use of fax has been somewhat supplanted by [[email]] as that technology became more widely used and embedded in the culture; the sort of urban legends that once circulated by fax are now likely to appear as [[email hoax]]es.  Specific computer related alarms are the subject of [[virus hoax]]es; email makes forwarding of texts relatively easy, and the frightening nature of the revelation makes it seem important to pass along, despite any doubts the sender might have.&lt;ref name="Preston, 1996"/&gt;

==Faxlore and urban legends==
[[File:Mickey mouse acid warning.png|thumb|An early example of a distributed warning about tattoo stickers allegedly laced with drugs, collected by [[Jan Brunvand]] in his book ''The Choking Doberman'']]
Other sorts of faxlore have had more serious consequences.  A number of more notorious urban legends have circulated in faxlore. The notorious "[[Blue star tattoo legend|Blue Star]] [[LSD|Acid]]" [[hoax]] is one well known example.

The "lights out" hoax, which claimed that people who were driving in the dark with their headlights out might be gang members, and that those who flashed their headlights at these drivers might be marked for [[murder]] as part of a [[gang]] initiation, was another hoax that was widely circulated as faxlore.&lt;ref&gt;Bunch, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  The poor graphic quality of the frequently re-sent faxes, which often were made out to appear to have originated with the police department of a distant [[city]], only made these hoaxes seem more credible.&lt;ref&gt;Brunvand, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal aspects==
In the [[United States]], collections of supposedly sinister symbols have been circulated among [[school]] administrators and [[police department]]s; in the 1980s these symbols were frequently alleged to be "[[Satanism|Satanic]] symbols", and in the 1990s they were alleged to be "gang symbols".  [[politics|Political]] or [[religion|religious]] symbols, like the [[peace symbol]], the [[Star of David]], the [[Rosary]], the [[ankh]], or the [[pentagram]] were mingled with other cryptic or fanciful symbols in these faxed and recirculated sheets, and the entire collection was condemned.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

On the authority of these anonymous, hard to trace, and impossible to [[cross-examination|cross-examine]] sources, school administrators sometimes acted to ban the wearing of Stars of David and similar symbols of minority religions.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  Typically, no compiler or author is given for the collection of symbols, though frightening descriptions are often given about their "secret meaning."  A number of [[civil liberties]] [[lawsuit]]s were filed over actions taken by school administrators who took these anonymous sources seriously.&lt;ref&gt;''Chalifoux'', 1997; ''Jeglin'', 1993; ''Jewish News Weekly'', 1999; ''Free Republic'', 2005; Bunch, 1993; Roberts et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar claim that the [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] logo was a "[[Satanism|satanic symbol]]" was linked in the 1980s to the activity of several [[Amway]] distributors, Amway being one of Procter &amp; Gamble's competitors; the hoax was spread by fax, photocopier, and later by [[voice mail]] and email.&lt;ref&gt;Emery, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Another occasional hoax claims that clothing and memorabilia of various [[university|universities]] or [[sports]] teams are "gang symbols".&lt;ref&gt;''Jeglin'', 1993; Roberts et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growing obsolescence ==
With the rise of the [[Internet]], media such as [[World Wide Web]], [[email]], [[instant messaging]], and [[social networking sites]] are now available to quickly and widely spread the sort of material that formerly circulated as faxlore. The hoax warnings of things such as dire and terrible [[computer virus]]es that still occasionally circulate, carry on one tradition of the bogus [[cautionary tale]] that used to circulate as faxlore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2925">The '''Festival of Fantastic Films''' is an annual non-profit celebration of ''cinema fantastique'', held annually in central [[Manchester, England]]. It was created by Tony Edwards and the late Harry Nadler (both members of the Delta Film Group, an amateur film-making society active in the 1960s and both past organisers of an [[Eastercon]]), together with their fellow enthusiast Gil Lane-Young.

Past guests have included: the producer [[Tony Tenser]]; the producer/director [[Roger Corman]]; directors [[Robert Fuest]], [[Val Guest]], [[Robin Hardy (film director)|Robin Hardy]], [[Jorge Grau]]; actors [[Andrew Keir]], [[Robin Askwith]], [[David Warbeck]], [[Ken Foree]], [[David Hess]], [[Norman Rossington]]; actresses [[Caroline Munro]], [[Barbara Shelley]], [[Anne Robinson]], [[Catriona MacColl]], [[Ingrid Pitt]].

Two prizes are presented each year: for the best amateur film screened (see entry for [[Delta Film Award|the Delta Film Award]]) and the best independent entry.

The 19th Festival of Fantastic Films was held on 17–19 October 2008 with [[Jess Conrad]] and [[Lamberto Bava]] among the guests appearing.

The 20th Festival was held on the 16–18 October 2009 with [[Emily Booth]], [[John Carson (actor)|John Carson]], [[Jenny Hanley]], [[John Hough (director)|John Hough]], [[Ian McCulloch (actor)|Ian McCulloch]], [[Derren Nesbitt]] and [[Peter Sasdy]] appearing. The winner of the best Independent Feature film at the 20th International Festival was ''Kirk'', a community project film by the Strathendrick Film Society, directed by Michael Ferns and produced by Joan Macpherson.

The Festival continues to be held every year; the 28th event in the series is planned for October 2017 in Manchester.

==Plot and setting==

Unlike many traditional role-playing games (RPGs), Forumwarz takes place on a fake, [[parody|parodic]] version of the [[Internet]]. The primary battlegrounds are in the form of virtual  [[internet forum]]s, as opposed to the fantasy settings found in traditional RPGs. Parody themes include [[furry fandom|furries]], [[script kiddies]], [[Boing Boing]], [[Apple Computer]], [[ricers]], [[4chan]], [[Ron Paul]], [[Fark]], [[gamers]], [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], [[Otaku]], [[Cory Doctorow]], and the [[Church of Scientology]].&lt;ref name="sutra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gawker"/&gt;

The player begins as a bored Internet user, searching on a parodied [[search engine]] (a thinly veiled analogue of [[Google]]). Soon their search query is interrupted by an [[Instant messaging|instant message]] from "Shallow Esophagus", a mysterious [[non-player character]] and  possible parody of [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]] who introduces them to the concept of "[[pwn]]age".&lt;ref name="zara"/&gt;

The player soon begins "pwning", or attacking, forums through various [[Troll (Internet)|trolling]] methods.  Following the first mission, one of four [[character class]]es can be chosen — "[[Emo kid#Fashion and stereotype|Emo Kid]]", "[[Troll (Internet)|Troll]]", "[[Camgirl|Camwhore]]", or "[[Hacker (computer security)|Hacker]]". The player may also choose to stay as a "[[Mental retardation|Re-Re]]", and later select the "Perma[[Newbie|noob]]" class.&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; The [[archetype]]s were chosen as the most "[[narcissism|narcissistic]] and crude web forum stereotypes".&lt;ref name="zara"/&gt; As forums become increasingly difficult to pwn, characters earn [[experience point]]s in the form of "[[credibility|cred]]", thus improving their statistics.&lt;ref name="waxy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waxy.org/archive/2008/02/25/forumwar.shtml|title=An interview with the Forumwarz creators|first=Andy|last=Baio|authorlink=Andy Baio (blogger)|date=2008-02-25|accessdate=2008-03-04|publisher=waxy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Forumwarz-Screenshot-Feb2008.png|thumb|left|Screenshot of the website's character page. The colors and imagery vary on what class the player picks.]]
Forumwarz takes place on a parodic version of the Internet, and the interface reflects this with an Instant Messaging client, [[online shopping]] for virtual items and services, and Internet forum battlegrounds.  The [[Instant Messaging Client]] is called sTalk, a pun on "stalk", and a parody of Google's IM client [[Google Talk|gTalk]].&lt;ref name="gateway"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegatewayonline.ca/site-unseen-forumwars-20080227-1937.html|title=Forumwarz Review|publisher=[[The Gateway (newspaper)|The Gateway]]|date=2008-02-27|accessdate=2008-03-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307210518/http://www.thegatewayonline.ca/site-unseen-forumwars-20080227-1937.html|archivedate=2008-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combat system is [[Turn-based game|turn-based]], and the player is given a set number of forum visits per day that they use to improve their character and proceed through the storyline. The player may attack virtual forums, each based on a different theme, with various attacks suited to their character class.&lt;ref name="zara"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/57097/zarathustran-analytics-in-video-games-part-1-finding-identity/|title=Zarathustran Analytics in Video Games, Part 1: Finding Identity|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|date=April 2008|accessdate=2008-08-27|last=Jeffries|first=L.B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks consist of posting varying obnoxious comments and [[Troll (Internet)|troll]]ing, via an array of attacks specific to the user class including "[[Self-injury|self-mutilation]]" (Emo Kids), "[[False allegation of child sexual abuse|threaten to contact authorities]]" (Camwhores), "[[ASCII art]] attacks" (Trolls), "[[font]] changing" (Hacker) and [[Tech support]] (Permanoob).

While attacking, the virtual inhabitants of the forum will respond and retaliate, causing the player damage. The [[hit points]] used in most [[Role-playing game|RPG]]s are replaced with "[[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]" in Forumwarz - if a player's ego is reduced to zero, the player is defeated.  Players can restore their ego using the game's version of health boosts - [[anti-depressants]].&lt;ref name="zara"/&gt;  For each [[Threaded discussion|thread]] in a forum that is successfully "pwned," or derailed through persistent attacking, the player gains "Cred"&lt;ref name="avclub"/&gt; and will be sent gifts from random Internet users as a reward the following day.

[[Side quests]] include a very brief [[text adventure]] game loosely based on the urban opera "[[Trapped in the Closet]]," featuring [[R. Kelly]]&lt;ref name="sutra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gawker"/&gt; as well as a second, much longer text adventure unlocked in Episode 2.

Players have the opportunity to purchase "Brownie Points" using their own (real) money.  Brownie Points are used to buy Episode 2 and 3.  Brownie Points can be used to buy "illegal game enhancements" that allow for accelerated progress through the game by giving the player many more forum visits than the standard 4 per day, an attack that instantly defeats forums, or large amounts of in-game currency. However, buying these enhancements will exclude the player from competitive aspects of the game unless he purchases an "un-cheat", which removes all in-game items and currency, so that no competitive advantage can be gained by "cheating".
The "Brownie points" can also be used to buy custom [[avatar (computing)|avatars]] or forum nicknames, for themselves or other players.&lt;ref name="weblogs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downloadsquad.com/2008/08/25/forumwarz-a-potentially-offensive-time-waster/|title=Forumwarz - a potentially offensive time waster|date=2008-08-25|accessdate=2008-08-27|last=Clark|first=Christine|publisher=Download Squad ([[Weblogs, Inc.]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==User-built content==

Players are able to contribute to their own forums using forumbuildr v2.0 Beta, an in-game application named after [[Web 2.0]] jargon. Each week, players vote on a topic to collectively build. Once a topic is chosen, players submit and vote on its components, including the content, logo and [[Style sheet (web development)|style sheet]]. At the end of the week, the forum is published and can be played by users.&lt;ref name="gawker"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "wim2"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Online World Atlas: ForumWarz - Pt. 2, In-Depth | publisher = Worlds in Motion  | url = http://www.worldsinmotion.biz/2008/07/online_world_atlas_forumwarz_p_1.php | accessdate = 2008-09-24|date=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, itembuildr was introduced, which, in a similar style to forumbuildr, allows players to contribute item descriptions and images which are then added to the game in the form of purchasable items.&lt;ref name = "itembuildr"&gt;{{cite web  | title =itembuildr is live! | publisher = Forumwarz  | url = http://blog.forumwarz.com/2009/3/10/itembuildr-is-live | accessdate = 2009-03-16|date=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiplayer==

Players also have the choice to interact in the [[multiplayer]] aspects of the game. This may be co-operatively, such as players joining together in [[Clan (computer gaming)|klans]],&lt;ref name = "wim2"/&gt; to work together in Domination [[Raid (gaming)|raids]], or just use is as a place to interact with others aside from Flamebate (the standard [[Internet forum|forums]]).
On the other hand, players may compete against each other, in several mini-games, such as the above-mentioned Domination,&lt;ref name = "wim2"/&gt; in which players earn scoops and Medals as a result. Players can also compete in INCIT, in which a random picture taken from [[Flickr]] is shown, and a [[motivational poster]] must be created, with a title and motivational text related to the picture. Players then vote which of the posters is the most amusing, the poster capturing the most votes being the winner.&lt;ref name = "wim1"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Online World Atlas: ForumWarz - Pt. 1, Overview  | publisher = Worlds in Motion| url = http://www.worldsinmotion.biz/2008/07/online_world_atlas_forumwarz_p.php  | accessdate = 2008-09-24|date=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another multiplayer feature is Kyoubai, an in-game auction house launched on January 16, 2009, in which players can bid on items for sale from other players. The mascot of Kyoubai is BidSquid, a cartoon squid with a cowboy hat and gavel. BidSquid was designed by Dooomcat Studios, who also did the class portraits and designed the homepage.&lt;ref name = "Kyoubai is Live!"&gt;{{cite web  | title =Kyoubai is Live! | publisher = Forumwarz  | url = http://blog.forumwarz.com/2009/1/16/kyoubai-is-live | accessdate = 2009-03-16|date=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical aspects==

Forumwarz was written using tools including [[Ruby on Rails]], [[MySQL]], [[Haml]], [[memcached]], [[script.aculo.us]] and the [[Prototype Javascript Framework]] and [[Phusion Passenger]] behind [[Nginx]].&lt;ref name="passenger"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward |first=Robin|title=Site Updates - July 22 |date=2008-11-28| url=http://blog.forumwarz.com/2008/7/23/site-updates-july-22 |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the approximately 5 million [[Dynamic web page|dynamic requests]] a day (varying from 55 to 75 requests per second depending on the time of day) and 25Gb of data transfer, Crotch Zombie uses a single 3&amp;nbsp;GHz [[Xeon]] server (due to the small size of the requests).

One of the elements used in the creation of Forumwarz was the creation of a [[machine translation]] tool, called '''Unintelligencer'''.  The tool translates standard written text into "unintelligent", mimicking "a literate person's text into something that wouldn't look out of place on a [[YouTube]] comment".  The tool was one of the elements used by the Forumwarz creators to create unique personalities for the artificial denizens of its simulated forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killerstartups.com/Web-App-Tools/Unintelligencercom---Who-Sed-Yur-Stoopid/|title=Unintelligencer.com - Who Sed Yur Stoopid | publisher=killerstartups.com| accessdate=2008-03-26| date=2008-03-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080329235330/http://www.killerstartups.com/Web-App-Tools/Unintelligencercom---Who-Sed-Yur-Stoopid/ |archivedate = March 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fraudulent conveyance''', or '''fraudulent transfer''', is an attempt to avoid debt by transferring money to another person or company. It is generally a civil, not a criminal matter, meaning that one cannot go to jail for it&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simkovic|first=Michael|date=2016-05-05|editor-last=Adler|editor-first=Barry|title=Making Fraudulent Transfer Law More Predictable|ssrn=2775920|series=Handbook on Bankruptcy|location=|publisher=Edward Elgar}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but in some jurisdictions there is potential for criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=Kevin|last2=Roy|first2=Julian|title=Fraud in the Canadian courts: An unwarranted expansion of the scope of the criminal sanction|journal=Canadian Business Law Journal|date=1998|volume=30|page=210|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/canadbus30&amp;div=18&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally treated as a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] cause of action that arises in [[debtor]]/[[creditor]] relations, particularly with reference to insolvent debtors.  The cause of action is typically brought by creditors or by [[bankruptcy]] [[trustees]]. 

==Overview==

A transfer will be fraudulent if made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor. Thus, if a transfer is made with the specific intent to avoid satisfying a specific liability, then actual intent is present. However, when a debtor prefers to pay one creditor instead of another, that is not a fraudulent transfer.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

There are two types of fraudulent transfer—''actual fraud'' and ''constructive fraud''. ''Actual fraud'' typically involves a debtor who as part of an [[asset protection|asset protection scheme]] donates his [[asset]]s, usually to an "insider", and leaves himself nothing to pay his creditors. ''Constructive fraud'' does not relate to fraudulent intent, but rather to the underlying economics of the transaction, if it took place for less than reasonably equivalent value at a time when the debtor was in a distressed financial condition. It is important to note that the actual distinction between the two different types of fraud is what the intentions of the debtor were. For example, where the debtor has simply been more generous than they should have or, in business transactions, the business should have ceased trading earlier to preserve capital (see generally, ''[[wrongful trading]]''). In a successful lawsuit, the [[plaintiff]] is entitled to recover the [[property]] transferred or its value from the transferee who has received a gift of the debtor's assets. Subsequent transferees may also be targeted, although they generally have stronger defenses than immediate transferees.&lt;ref name="LBO"&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1632084 Leveraged Buyout Bankruptcies, the Problem of Hindsight Bias, and the Credit Default Swap Solution] Columbia Business Law Review, Vol. 2011, No. 1, p. 118, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Although fraudulent transfer law originally evolved in the context of a relatively simple agrarian economy, it is now widely used to challenge complex modern financial transactions such as [[leveraged buyouts]].&lt;ref name="LBO"/&gt;

Fraudulent transfer liability will often turn on the financial condition of the debtor at a particular point in the past. This analysis has historically required "dueling" expert testimony from both plaintiffs and defendants, which often led to an expensive process and inconsistent and unpredictable results.&lt;ref name=LBO/&gt; Courts and scholars have recently developed market-based approaches to try to make this analysis simpler, more consistent across cases, and more predictable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=LBO /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amicus"&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1632084 Amicus Brief, In re Lyondell Chemical Company bankruptcy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Badges of fraud===

Evidence of actual intent is rarely available to a creditor for it would require proof of someone’s inner thoughts. Because of that, creditors often have to rely on circumstantial evidence of fraud. To prove actual intent, the courts have developed “badges of fraud,” which, while not conclusive, are considered by the courts as circumstantial evidence of fraud:{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkland.com/siteFiles/kirkexp/publications/2402/Document1/Friedland_Trustees_Power.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

*Becoming insolvent because of the transfer;
*Lack or inadequacy of consideration;
*Family, or insider relationship among parties;
*The retention of possession, benefits or use of property in question;
*The existence of the threat of litigation;
*The financial situation of the debtor at the time of transfer or after transfer;
*The existence or a cumulative effect of a series of transactions after the onset of debtor’s financial difficulties;
*The general chronology of events;
*The secrecy of the transaction in question; and
*Deviation from the usual method or course of business.

===Australia===
Under [[Australian law]], if a transaction is entered into by a company which subsequently goes into liquidation, and the transaction was entered into by the company for the purpose of defeating, delaying or interfering with the rights of creditors during the 10 years prior to the relation back day, the courts may set it aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588fe.html|title=Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), section 588FE(5).|publisher=AUSTLII|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relation-back day is defined as either the day upon which the application for the company's winding-up was filed, or the date of the commencement of liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s9.html|title=Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), section 9.|publisher=AUSTLII|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Insolvency Act 1986]] section 423

=== United States ===
In [[United Kingdom–United States relations|Anglo-American]] law, the doctrine of Fraudulent Conveyance traces its origins back to ''[[Twyne's Case]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1601) 3 Coke 80; 76 E.R. 809&lt;/ref&gt; in which an English farmer attempted to defraud his creditors by selling his sheep to a man named Twyne, while remaining in possession of the sheep, marking and shearing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Story|first1=William W.|title=A Treatise On The Law Of Contracts|date=1874|publisher=Little, Brown, And Company|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=1584776188|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1uReYUl-EwEC|accessdate=10 September 2017}} Fraud Upon Third Persons, Part 4, Sec 659.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[United States]], fraudulent conveyances or transfers&lt;ref&gt;The term ''fraudulent conveyance'' is included within the more general term ''fraudulent transfer'', as a ''conveyance'' is more descriptive of the transfer of title to real property. ''Fraudulent transfer'', however, includes all types of property and in the U.S., both are generally all governed by the same law. Therefore, the ''transfer'' will be used for the remainder of this section.&lt;/ref&gt; are governed by two sets of laws that are generally consistent. The first is the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act&lt;ref&gt;Promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) in 1984&lt;/ref&gt; ("UFTA") that has been adopted by all but a handful of the states.&lt;ref&gt;As of June, 2005, 43 states and the District of Columbia had adopted it. See NCCUSL website, [http://www.nccusl.org NCCUSL.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225032825/http://www.nccusl.org/ |date=2011-02-25 }} A complete copy can be found there or at [[South Texas College of Law]], [http://www.stcl.edu/rosin/ufta84.pdf STCL.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The second is found in the federal Bankruptcy Code.&lt;ref&gt;11 USC § 548. Much of the language of this section was adopted from the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, which is the predecessor of the UFTA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UFTA and the Bankruptcy Code both provide that a transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor if the debtor made the transfer with the "actual intention to hinder, delay or defraud" any creditor of the debtor.

There are two kinds of fraudulent transfer. The archetypal example is the intentional fraudulent transfer. This is a transfer of property made by a debtor with intent to defraud, hinder, or delay his or her creditors.&lt;ref&gt;11 USC § 548(1); UFTA § 4(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; The second is a constructive fraudulent transfer. Generally, this occurs when a debtor transfers property without receiving "reasonably equivalent value" in exchange for the transfer if the debtor is [[insolvent]]&lt;ref&gt;Under the Bankruptcy Code, insolvency exists when the sum of the debtor's debts exceeds the fair value of the debtor's property, with some exceptions. It is a balance sheet test. 11 USC § 101(32)&lt;/ref&gt; at the time of the transfer or becomes insolvent or is left with unreasonably small capital to continue in business as a result of the transfer.&lt;ref&gt;11 USC § 548(2); UFTA § 4(a)(2).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the intentional fraudulent transfer, no intention to defraud is necessary.

The Bankruptcy Code authorizes a bankruptcy trustee to recover the property transferred fraudulently&lt;ref&gt;This is done through the mechanism of avoidance of the transfer. 11 USC § 548.&lt;/ref&gt; for the benefit of all of the creditors of the debtor&lt;ref&gt;11 USC § 551&lt;/ref&gt; if the transfer took place within the relevant time frame.&lt;ref&gt;Within two years prior to the filing of bankruptcy - 11 USC § 548(a)&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer may also be recovered by a bankruptcy trustee under the UFTA too, if the state in which the transfer took place has adopted it and the transfer took place within its relevant time period.&lt;ref&gt;11 USC § 544(b) allows trustees to employ applicable state law to recover fraudulent transfers. The time period under the UFTA is in most cases four years before action is brought to recover. - UFTA § 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Creditors may also pursue remedies under the UFTA without the necessity of a bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;UFTA § 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Because this second type of transfer does not necessarily involve any actual wrongdoing, it is a common trap into which honest, but unwary debtors fall when filing a bankruptcy petition without an attorney. Particularly devastating and not uncommon is the situation in which an adult child takes title to the parents' home as a self-help [[probate]] measure (in order to avoid any confusion about who owns the home when the parents die and to avoid losing the home to a perceived threat from the state). Later, when the parents file a bankruptcy [[petition]] without recognizing the problem, they are unable to exempt the home from administration by the [[trustee]]. Unless they are able to pay the trustee an amount equal to the greater of the equity in the home or the sum of their debts (either directly to the Chapter 7 trustee or in payments to a Chapter 13 trustee), the trustee will sell their home to pay the creditors. In many cases, the parents would have been able to exempt the home and carry it safely through a bankruptcy if they had retained title or had recovered title before filing.

Even ''[[good faith]] purchasers'' of property who are the recipients of fraudulent transfers are only partially protected by the law in the U.S. Under the Bankruptcy Code, they get to keep the transfer to the extent of the value they gave for it, which means that they may lose much of the benefit of their bargain, even though they have no knowledge that the transfer to them is fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''Gill v. Maddalena'', 176 B.R. 551, 555, 558 (Bankr.C.D.Cal. 1994) (citing 11 USC § 548(c))&lt;/ref&gt;

Often fraudulent transfers occur in connection with [[leveraged buyouts]] (LBOs), where the [[management]]/owners of a failing [[corporation]] will cause the corporation to borrow on its assets and use the loan proceeds to purchase the management/owner's stock at highly inflated prices. The creditors of the corporation will then often have little or no unencumbered assets left upon which to collect their debts. LBOs can be either intentional or constructive fraudulent transfers, or both, depending on how obviously the corporation is financially impaired when the transaction is completed.&lt;ref name=LBO /&gt;

Although not all LBOs are fraudulent transfers, a red flag is raised when, after an LBO, the company then cannot pay its creditors.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Murphy v. Meritor Savings Bank'', 126 B.R. 370, 393, 413 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1991), in which an LBO left the corporation with insufficient cash to operate for longer than 10 days.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraudulent transfer liability will often turn on the financial condition of the debtor at a particular point in the past. This analysis has historically required "dueling" expert testimony from both plaintiffs and defendants, which often led to an expensive process and inconsistent and unpredictable results.&lt;ref name=LBO/&gt; U.S. courts and scholars have recently developed market-based approaches to try to streamline the analysis of constructive fraud, and judges are increasingly focusing on these market based measures.&lt;ref name=LBO /&gt;&lt;ref name=Amicus /&gt;

===Switzerland===
{{main article|Insolvency law of Switzerland}}
Under [[Switzerland|Swiss]] law, creditors who hold a certificate of unpaid debts against the debtor, or creditors in a bankruptcy, may file suit against [[Third party (law)|third parties]] who have benefited from [[unfair preference]]s or fraudulent transfers by the debtor prior to a seizure of assets or a [[bankruptcy]].

===South Korea===
Fraudulent conveyance or also known as action revocatoire or Pauline action (채권자취소권) is a right to preserve the debtor's property for all creditors by canceling an action by the debtor which reduces the debtor's property with a knowledge that the action harms the rights of the creditor. To exercise this right, the creditor must have a right against the debtor which is monetary and not unique and personal in nature. For instance, the right to demand to clear of the land of the building or the right to delivery the land involves land and unique and therefore not subject to Pauline action(Korean Supreme Court Decision February 10, 1995, 94da2534).

The '''Herald Sun Tour''' is an [[Australia]]n professional bicycle race held in [[Melbourne]] and provincial [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], sanctioned by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI). The first tour was held in October 1952 as a six-day event. It is now held annually over five days in February.  It is named after the ''[[Herald Sun]]'', Melbourne's only daily tabloid newspaper.  It was originally known as the '''Sun Tour''' after ''[[The Sun News-Pictorial]]'', and changed its name when ''The Sun News-Pictorial'' merged with ''[[The Herald (Melbourne)|The Herald]]'' in 1990.

==History==

In 1952 the first general classification winner was Keith Rowley, a [[Maffra, Victoria|Maffra]] sheep farmer, in a time of 42 h 57 min 55 s. The first King of the Mountain and Sprint champion was Jack (John) McDonough from [[Coburg, Victoria|Coburg]].

Australian cyclists dominated the first 30 editions of the race, before its status rose and began attracting overseas stars. By the year 2000, the race had shifted to October and Australia's cyclists racing in Europe began to compete in the race. The resulting rise in the event's standard saw the race become rated by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] for the first time in 2005.
Several notable Australian cyclists have won the General classification including [[Stuart O'Grady]] in 2008, [[Baden Cooke]] in 2002, [[Neil Stephens]] in 1986, and [[Russell Mockridge]] in 1957.

The 2004 race was conducted from 14 to 24 October 2004 and involved 85 cyclists in seventeen teams of five. Thirteen stages were completed with a total distance of 1110.7&amp;nbsp;km, 119 intermediate sprints and 37 hill climbs, including the two category one climbs of [[Mount Baw Baw]] and in the [[Otway National Park|Otway Ranges]]. Swedish rider Jonas Ljungblad won the General classification in the time of 26 h 39 min 55 s. Karl Menzies won the sprint classification and Phillip Thuaux won the Mountains classification.

After the 2009 race, the organisers of the Herald Sun Tour proposed moving the race from its traditional October date to February, with no edition in 2010. [[Cycling Australia]] approved the move,&lt;ref&gt;''SBS Cycling Central'', "Date change for Jayco Herald Sun Tour", 24 February 2010, [http://www.sbs.com.au/cyclingcentral/news/8342/Date-change-for-Jayco-Herald-Sun-Tour], accessed 30 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; but in the face of opposition from the UCI,&lt;ref&gt;''The Age'', "Herald Sun Tour bid appears doomed", 23 January 2010, [http://www.theage.com.au/sport/cycling/herald-sun-tour-bid-appears-doomed-20100123-mr5d.html], accessed 30 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; the plans never came to fruition. In the end, the 2010 race was "held over" due to the [[2010 UCI Road World Championships]] being held in [[Geelong]] and [[Melbourne]], and the race returned to the calendar in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Schlink, "2011 Jayco Herald Sun Tour back with a bang", ''The Herald Sun'', 25 March 2011, [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/jayco-herald-sun-tour-back-with-a-bang/story-fn3owcsl-1226027810420], accessed 30 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The UCI accepted a change of date the following year, with a January 2013 date instead of October 2012, but downgraded the race from 2.1 to a National Event, preventing most professional teams from across the world from taking part.&lt;ref&gt;"Gerrans questions lack of UCI ranking for Jayco Herald Sun Tour", ''Velonation'', [http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/13439/Gerrans-questions-lack-of-UCI-ranking-for-Jayco-Herald-Sun-Tour.aspx], accessed 23 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014===
The next edition of the Tour was held from 5–9 February 2014, and regained a UCI 2.1 ranking, permitting top level trade teams to again compete.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbs.com.au/cyclingcentral/road/news/51277/herald-sun-tour-to-regain-uci-status "Herald Sun Tour to regain UCI status", ''SBS Cycling Central'', 16 September 2013, accessed 17 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Due to numerous bushfires across Victoria the last stage of the race was cancelled, with {{ct|OGE|2014}} rider [[Simon Clarke (cyclist)|Simon Clarke]] declared the winner.&lt;ref name="hs-jayco-cancelled"&gt;http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/more-sports/jayco-herald-sun-tour-last-stage-cancelled-clarke-declared-winner-with-fire-risk-too-great-and-police-needed-elsewhere/story-fnibbyyv-1226821752824&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===
The 63rd edition of the Tour got a huge profile boost when reigning [[Tour de France]] champion [[Chris Froome]] of {{ct|SKY|2016}} confirmed he would be starting his 2016 season at the event, having previously participated in 2008 with the Barloworld team where he finished 4th overall.  Froome won the overall title on the final stage on Arthurs Seat, making him the first defending Tour de France champion to win the race, with teammate [[Peter Kennaugh]] finishing second.  He also took the mountains classification.&lt;ref name="Report 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/herald-sun-tour-2016/stage-4/results/ |title=Chris Froome wins Jayco Herald Sun Tour |publisher=cyclingnews.com |date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===
The 64th edition of the race was won by [[Damien Howson]] of {{ct|MTS men|2017}}.&lt;ref name="Report 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/jayco-herald-sun-tour-2017/stage-4/results/ |title=Howson wins 2017 Herald Sun Tour |publisher=cyclingnews.com |date=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018===
The 65th edition of the Herald Sun Tour was won by [[Esteban Chaves]] of the [[UCI World Tour|World Tour]] ranked {{ct|OGE|2018}} team. Michelton Scott dominated the general classification of the 2018 edition with team mates [[Cameron Meyer]] (2nd) and previous winner [[Damien Howson]] (3rd) rounding out the final podium.&lt;ref name="Report 2018"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/herald-sun-tour/2018/gc|title=Herald Sun Tour 2018|website=www.procyclingstats.com|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Irish Famine of 1740–1741''' ({{lang-ga|Bliain an Áir}}, meaning '''the Year of Slaughter''') in the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], is estimated to have killed between 13% and 20% of the 1740 population of 2.4 million people, which was a proportionately greater loss than during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of 1845–1852.&lt;ref&gt;Cathal Póirtéir, (ed.) ''The Great Irish Famine'' (1955), Mercier Press, pp. 53-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Independent'' [https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/dancing-on-ice-recalling-the-great-frost-of-1740-36663457.html], 2018-4-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; James Kelly, ''Food Rioting in Ireland in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries, Four Courts Press, 2017, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

The famine of 1740–41 was due to extremely cold and then rainy weather in successive years, resulting in food losses in three categories: a series of poor [[Food grain|grain]] [[harvest]]s, a shortage of [[milk]], and frost damage to [[potato]]es.&lt;ref name="clarkson"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2uKb3b3-LRgC Leslie Clarkson, Margaret Crawford, ''Feast and Famine: Food and Nutrition in Ireland 1500-1920''], Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, grains, particularly [[oatmeal|oats]], were more important than potatoes as staples in the diet of most workers.

Deaths from mass [[starvation]] in 1740–41 were compounded by an outbreak of fatal diseases. The cold and its effects extended across Europe, but mortality was higher in Ireland because both grain and potatoes [[Harvest failure|failed]]. This is now considered by scholars to be the last serious cold period at the end of the [[Little Ice Age]] of about 1400–1800.

By the mid-19th century's better-known [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of 1845–1852, potatoes made up a greater portion of the Irish diets, with adverse consequences when the crops failed. This famine differed by "cause, scale and timing:" it was caused by an [[oomycete]] infection which destroyed much of the potato crop for several years running. The crisis was exacerbated by insufficient relief and extreme government regulations.

==Background==
In 1740, Ireland had a population of 2.4 million people, most of whom depended on grains (oats, wheat, barley and rye) and potatoes as their [[staple foods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crops and Machinery|url=http://thefamilyfarm.ie/cropsmachinery/|website=The Family Farm|publisher=[[Dublin Zoo]] and Agri Aware|accessdate=23 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123142103/http://thefamilyfarm.ie/cropsmachinery/|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half their expenses for food went for grain, 35% for animal products and the remainder for potatoes.&lt;ref name="clarkson"/&gt; Some survived only on oatmeal, buttermilk and potatoes. Over a year, daily consumption of potatoes was estimated at {{convert|6|to|7|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} per person.&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson and Crawford (2001), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Diets varied according to village locations and individual income, with many people supplementing these staples with river, lake or sea fish, especially [[herring]], and small game such as wild duck. At the time social welfare was an entirely private initiative undertaken on a local level by the village or parish, with the government not being orientated for large-scale relief efforts.


==Cause==
An extraordinary climatic shock, known as the "Great Frost", struck Ireland and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741 following a decade of relatively mild winters. Its cause remains unknown. Charting its course sharply illuminates how climate events can result in famine and [[epidemic]] disease, and affect economies, [[energy source]]s, and politics.

Although no barometric or temperature readings for Ireland survive from the Great Frost, a scattered few records survive from Englishmen who made personal readings. The mercury thermometer was invented 25 years earlier by the German pioneer [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit]]. Indoor values during January 1740 were as low as {{convert|10|°F|°C}}.&lt;ref name="Dickson p 12"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Dickson|title=Arctic Ireland: The Extraordinary Story of the Great Frost and Forgotten Famine of 1740–41|publisher=White Row Press Ltd |location=Belfast |year=1997|isbn=978-1-870132-85-5|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one outdoor reading that has survived was stated as "thirty-two degrees of frost." This did not include the effects of the [[wind chill]] factor, which would have been severe. This kind of weather was "quite outside the Irish experience," notes David Dickson, author of ''Arctic Ireland: The Extraordinary Story of the Great Frost and Forgotten Famine of 1740–41''.&lt;ref name="Dickson p 12"/&gt;

In the period before the crisis in January 1740, the winds and terrible cold intensified, yet barely any snow fell. Ireland was locked into a stable and vast high-pressure system which affected most of Europe in a broadly similar way, from Scandinavia and Russia to northern Italy.  Rivers, lakes, and waterfalls froze and fish died in these first weeks of the Great Frost. People tried to avoid [[hypothermia]] without using up winter fuel reserves in a matter of days. People who lived in the country were probably better off than city dwellers, because in Ireland, country people had cabins sheltered by [[Sod|turf]] stacks, while the latter, especially the poor, dwelt in freezing basements and [[garret]]s.

Coal dealers and shippers during normal times ferried coal from [[Cumbria]] and [[south Wales]] to east and south-coast ports in Ireland, but the ice-bound quays and frozen coal yards temporarily stopped such trade. When in late January 1740 the traffic across the [[Irish Sea]] resumed, retail prices for coal soared. Desperate people stripped bare hedges, ornamental trees, and nurseries around [[Dublin]] to obtain substitute fuel.  Also affected by the Frost were the pre-industrial town mill-wheels, which froze.  The machinery was stilled that customarily ground wheat for the bakers, tucked cloth for the weavers, and pulped rags for the printers. The abrupt weather change disrupted craft employment and food processing.

==Protestants and alms-giving==
[[Image:Conollys Folly - the obelisk.jpg|thumb|right|The Conolly Folly, built in 1740 to give employment to local workers]]

The municipal leaders (mostly Protestant merchants and members of the landed gentry), however, paid closer attention to the state of urban and rural artisans and tradespeople because of their contributions to the commercial economy on which the landowners depended. These leaders knew from experience that "an unemployed or hungry town often became a sickly town and such sickness might be no respecter of class or wealth."&lt;ref&gt;Dickson (1997), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  This is what happened as the Frost continued.

The propertied classes began to respond to fuel and food shortages when the Frost was about two weeks old. The [[Church of Ireland]] parish clergy solicited donations, which they converted into free rations in the city parishes, distributing nearly 80 tons of coal and ten tons of meal four weeks into the Frost. The [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], [[William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire|the Duke of Devonshire]], in an unprecedented move on 19 January 1740, prohibited export of grain out of Ireland to any destination except Britain. This action was in response to Cork Corporation (City of Cork), which remembered vividly the city events of eleven years earlier when serious food riots erupted and four people died.

In [[Celbridge]], [[County Kildare]], Katherine, the widow of [[William Conolly]], commissioned construction of the [[Conolly's Folly|Conolly Folly]] in 1740 to give employment to local workers. In 1743, she had [[The Wonderful Barn]] built nearby as a food store in case of further famines.

==Potatoes deteriorate==
The Great Frost affected the potato, which was one of the two main staples (the other was oatmeal) in rural Ireland. Potatoes typically were left in storage in gardens and in special storage in fields. The crops from the autumn of 1739 were frozen, destroyed, and inedible. They could not even serve as seed for the next growing season. "Richard Purcell, one of the best rural witnesses of the unfolding crisis, reported in late February [1740] that had the Frost not occurred, there would have been enough potatoes in his district to have kept the country [Ireland] fed until August [1740], indicating a rare local abundance of the crop. 'But both root and branch…is destroyed every where', except for 'a few which happen'd to be housed', and 'in a very few deep…and turfy moulded gardens where some, perhaps enough for seed for the same ground, are sound.'"&lt;ref&gt;Dickson (1997), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, potatoes were typically stored in the fields where they were grown, in earthen banks known as potato clamps.&lt;ref name="clamp"&gt;[http://secrets-of-self-sufficiency.com/how-to-store-vegetables Illustrative Potato Clamp Design]&lt;/ref&gt; They were put among layers of soil and straw that normally prevented frost from penetrating deeply enough to destroy the contents of the clamp. This disruption of the agricultural cycle created problems in Ireland in the winter of 1740–1741.

==Spring drought, 1740==
In spring 1740, the expected rains did not arrive. Although the Frost dissipated, the temperatures remained low and the northerly winds fierce. The drought killed off animals in the field, particularly sheep in [[Connacht]] and black cattle in the south.

By the end of April, it destroyed much of the [[tillage]] crops (wheat and barley) sown the previous autumn, and grains were more important in the diet than were potatoes. The important corn crop also failed, which resulted in greater mortality in Ireland than in Britain or the Continent.&lt;ref name="crawford"&gt;Clarkson and Crawford (2001), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Grains were so scarce that the Irish hierarchy of the Catholic Church allowed Catholics to eat meat four days each week during [[Lent]], but not everyone could afford meat, either. The potato crisis caused an increase in grain prices, resulting in smaller and smaller loaves of bread for the old price. Dickson explains that the "wholesale rise in the price of wheat, oats and barley reflected not just the current supply position, but the dealers' assessment as to the state of things later in the year."&lt;ref&gt;Dickson (1997), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

By summer 1740, the Frost had decimated the potatoes, and the drought had decimated the grain harvest and herds of cattle and sheep. Starving rural dwellers started a "mass vagrancy" towards the better-supplied towns, such as Cork in southern Ireland. By mid-June 1740, beggars lined the streets.

==Food riots==
With the soaring cost of food, hungry townspeople "vented their frustration on grain dealers, meal-mongers and bakers, and when they turned to direct action the most likely flashpoints were markets or warehouses" where food owners stored bulk food.&lt;ref name="Dickson, p 27"&gt;Dickson (1997), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The first "flareup" occurred at [[Drogheda]], north of Dublin on the east coast of Ireland, in mid-April. A band of citizens boarded a vessel laden with oatmeal, which was preparing to depart for Scotland. They removed the rudder and sails. The Drogheda officials made sure that Scotland would receive no more food from their port. They, like the Cork Corporation officials, wanted no trouble from the Irish citizens.

A riot broke out in Dublin on Saturday and Sunday near the end of May 1740 when the populace believed that bakers were holding off baking bread. They [[Looting|broke into the bakers' shops]] and sold some of the loaves, giving the money to the bakers. Other people simply took the bread and left. On Monday, rioters raided to take the meal from mills near the city and resold it at discounted prices. Trying to restore order, troops from the Royal Barracks [[Police Brutality|killed several rioters.]] City officials tried to "smoke out hoarders of grain and to police food markets, but prices remained stubbornly high throughout the summer."&lt;ref name="Dickson, p 27"/&gt;

Similar skirmishes over food continued in different Irish cities throughout the summer of 1740. The [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740-48) began, interrupting trade as Spanish [[privateers]] captured ships bound for Ireland, including those carrying grain. Linen, salted beef and pickled butter were Ireland's chief export earners, and the war endangered this trade as well.

==The cold returns==
In autumn 1740, a meagre harvest commenced and prices in the towns started to fall. Cattle began to recover. But in the dairying districts, cows had been so weak after the Frost that at least a third of them had failed to "take bull," or become impregnated at breeding. This resulted in fewer calves, a shortage of milk, which was widely consumed, and a decline in butter production.

To make conditions worse, blizzards swept along the east coast in late October 1740 depositing snow and returned several times in November. A massive rain downpour on 9 December 1740 caused widespread flooding. A day after the floods, the temperature plummeted, snow fell, and rivers and other bodies of water froze. Warm temperatures followed the cold snap, which lasted about ten days. Great chunks of ice careened down the Liffey River through the heart of Dublin, overturning light vessels and causing larger vessels to break anchor.

The strange autumn of 1740 pushed food prices back up, e.g., Dublin wheat prices on 20 December were at an all-time high. The widening wars in mid-December 1740 encouraged people with stored food to hold onto it. The populace needed food, and riots erupted again in various cities throughout the country. By December 1740, signs were growing that full-blown famine and epidemic were upon the citizens of Ireland.

==Relief schemes==
The [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]], Samuel Cooke, consulted with the [[Lord Justices (Ireland)|Lords Justices]]- [[Archbishop Boulter]], [[Henry Boyle, 1st Earl of Shannon|Henry Boyle, Speaker of the Commons]] and the [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]], [[Robert Jocelyn, 1st Viscount Jocelyn|Lord Jocelyn]]- on 15 December 1740 to figure out a way to bring down the price of corn. Boulter launched an emergency feeding program for the poor of Dublin at his own expense. The Privy Council instructed the [[High Sheriff]] in each county to count all stocks of grain in the possession of farmers and merchants and to report total cereal stocks in their county.

The reports indicated a number of privately held stocks, for instance [[County Louth]] held over 85,000 barrels of grain, mainly oats, owned by some 1,655 farmers. Some major landowners, such as the widow of Speaker [[William Conolly]], builder of [[Castletown House]], distributed food and cash during the "black spring" of 1741 on their own initiative . The widow Conolly and other philanthropists hired workers to develop infrastructure or do work associated with local improvements: such as building an obelisk, paving, fencing, draining, making roads or canals, and cleaning harbours. In Drogheda the [[Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas]], [[Henry Singleton (judge)|Henry Singleton]],  a citizen of the town, donated much of his private fortune for famine relief.

==Return of normal weather==
Five vessels loaded with grain, presumably from America, reached [[Galway]] on the west coast in June 1741. In the first week of July 1741, grain prices at last decreased and old hoarded wheat suddenly flooded the market. The quality of the Autumn harvest of 1741 was mixed. The food crisis was over, however, and seasons of rare plenty followed for the next two years.

==Death toll==
Documentation of deaths was poor during the Great Frost. Cemeteries provide fragmentary information, e.g., during February and March 1740, 47 children were buried in St. Catherine's parish. The normal death rate tripled in January and February 1740, and burials averaged out about 50% higher during the twenty-one-month crisis than for the years 1737–1739, according to Dickson. Summing up all his sources, Dickson suggests that the famine resulted in the deaths of between 13–20% of the population.

Based on contemporary accounts and burial parish records, famine-related deaths may have totaled 300,000-480,000 in Ireland, with rates highest in the south and east of the country. This was a proportionately greater toll than during the Great Famine (1845–49).&lt;ref&gt;Sir William Wilde, "Table of Cosmical Phenomena," pp. 124-32; Dickson, "The other great famine," in Cathal Póirtéir, (ed.) ''The Great Irish Famine'' (1955), Mercier Press, pp. 53-55; and David Dickson, "The gap in famines: a useful myth?", in E. Margaret Crawford (ed.), ''Famine: the Irish experience'', Edinburgh: John Donald, 1989, pp. 97-98&lt;/ref&gt;  That famine, however, was unique in "cause, scale and timing," persisting over several years.&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson and Crawford (2001), p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the deaths occurred among the lower classes, with the poorest third of the population gaining all their nutrition from potatoes alone, the crop which the blight affected. Therefore, when the potatoes blight occurred these people were left with practically no means of sustenance.

==Summary==
The Irish Great Frost of 1740–1741 demonstrated human social behaviour under crisis conditions, and the far-reaching effects of a major climate crisis. As conditions eased, "the population entered into a period of unprecedented growth," although additional famines occurred during the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson and Crawford (2001), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Dickson notes that an upsurge in migration out of Ireland in the years after the 1740–1741 crisis did not take place, perhaps in part because conditions improved relatively quickly although the most likely primary reason was that a transoceanic voyage was far beyond the means of most of the population at this time. Irish [[Dendrochronologist]] Mike Baillie has confirmed tree ring patterns in 1740 that were consistent with severe cold.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Baillie: ''A Slice Through Time: Dendrochronology and Precision Dating.'' Routledge, London, 1996, pp. 16–31&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 1741, during which the famine was at its worst and mortality was greatest, was known in folk memory as the "year of the slaughter" (or ''bliain an áir'' in Irish).

Ireland faced an extended crisis in the 1840s famine, which lasted longer than the 1740s events. One-third of the potato crop failed in 1845 and 1848, but two-thirds failed in 1846, a massive loss.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17971">In [[financial economics]], a '''liquidity crisis''' refers to an acute shortage (or "drying up") of ''liquidity''.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of liquidity crises and liquidity more broadly, see the book by Amihud, Mendelson and Pedersen, "Market Liquidity: Asset Pricing, Risk, and Crises", Cambridge University Press, 2013. http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521139656&lt;/ref&gt; Liquidity may refer to [[market liquidity]] (the ease with which an asset can be converted into a liquid medium, e.g. cash), [[funding liquidity]] (the ease with which borrowers can obtain external funding), or [[accounting liquidity]] (the health of an institution's [[balance sheet]] measured in terms of its cash-like assets). Additionally, some economists define a market to be liquid if it can absorb "liquidity trades" (sale of [[Security (finance)|securities]] by [[investor]]s to meet sudden needs for cash) without large changes in price. This shortage of liquidity could reflect a fall in asset prices below their long run fundamental price, deterioration in external financing conditions, reduction in the number of market participants, or simply difficulty in trading assets.&lt;ref&gt;These definitions are based on the "Arvind Krishnamurthy, Amplification Mechanisms in Liquidity Crises," Northwestern, mimeo.&lt;/ref&gt;

The above-mentioned forces mutually reinforce each other during a liquidity crisis. Market participants in need of [[cash]] find it hard to locate potential trading partners to sell their [[asset]]s. This may result either due to limited market participation or because of a decrease in cash held by [[financial market participants]]. Thus asset holders may be forced to sell their assets at a price below the long term fundamental price. Borrowers typically face higher loan costs and [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] requirements, compared to periods of ample liquidity, and [[unsecured debt]] is nearly impossible to obtain. Typically, during a liquidity crisis, the [[interbank lending market]] does not function smoothly either.

Several mechanisms operating through the mutual reinforcement of asset market liquidity and funding liquidity can amplify the effects of a small negative shock to the economy and result in lack of liquidity and eventually a full blown [[financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Arvind Krishnamurthy, Amplification Mechanisms in Liquidity Crises," Northwestern, mimeo&lt;/ref&gt;

== A model of liquidity crisis ==
{{main|Diamond–Dybvig model}}

One of the earliest and most influential models of liquidity crisis and bank runs was given by Diamond and Dybvig in 1983. The [[Diamond–Dybvig model]] demonstrates how [[financial intermediation]] by banks, performed by accepting assets that are inherently illiquid and offering liabilities which are much more liquid (offer a smoother pattern of returns),  can make banks vulnerable to a [[bank run]]. Emphasizing the role played by demand deposit contracts in providing liquidity and better risk sharing among people, they argue that such a [[demand deposit]] contract has a potential undesirable equilibrium where all depositors panic and withdraw their deposits immediately. This gives rise to self-fulfilling panics among depositors, as we observe withdrawals by even those depositors who would have actually preferred to leave their deposits in, if they were not concerned about the bank failing. This can lead to failure of even 'healthy' banks and eventually an economy-wide contraction of liquidity, resulting in a full blown financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond DW, Dybvig PH (1983). "Bank runs, deposit insurance, and liquidity". Journal of Political Economy 91 (3): 401–419. {{doi|10.1086/261155}}. Reprinted (2000) Fed Res Bank Mn Q Rev 24 (1), 14–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond and Dybvig demonstrate that when banks provide pure demand deposit contracts, we can actually have multiple equilibria. If confidence is maintained, such contracts can actually improve on the [[competitive market]] outcome and provide better risk sharing. In such an equilibrium, a depositor will only withdraw when it is appropriate for him to do so under optimal risk–sharing. However, if agents panic, their incentives are distorted and in such an equilibrium, all depositors withdraw their deposits. Since liquidated assets are sold at a loss, therefore in this scenario, a bank will liquidate all its assets, even if not all depositors withdraw.

Note that the underlying reason for withdrawals by depositors in the Diamond–Dybvig model is a '''shift in expectations'''. Alternatively, a bank run may occur because bank's assets, which are liquid but risky, no longer cover the nominally fixed liability (demand deposits), and depositors therefore withdraw quickly to minimize their potential losses.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Fisher, The Purchasing Power of Money, its Determination and Relation to Credit, Interest and Crises [1911]&lt;/ref&gt;

The model also provides a suitable framework for analysis of devices that can be used to contain and even prevent a liquidity crisis (elaborated below).

== Amplification mechanisms ==
{{main|Financial accelerator}}

One of the mechanisms, that can work to amplify the effects of a small negative shock to the economy, is the '''Balance Sheet Mechanism'''. Under this mechanism, a negative shock in the financial market lowers asset prices and erodes the financial institution's capital thus worsening its balance sheet. Consequently, two '''liquidity spirals''' come into effect, which amplify the impact of the initial negative shock. In an attempt to maintain its [[leverage ratio]], the financial institution must sell its assets, precisely at a time when their price is low. Thus, assuming that asset prices depend on the health of investors' balance sheet, erosion of investors' [[net worth]] further reduces asset prices, which feeds back into their balance sheet and so on. This is what [[Markus Brunnermeier|Brunnermeier]] and [[Lasse Heje Pedersen|Pedersen]] (2008) term as the "loss spiral". At the same time, lending standards and [[Margin (finance)|margins]] tighten, leading to the "margin spiral". Both these effects cause the borrowers to engage in a [[fire sale]], lowering prices and deteriorating external financing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;"Arvind Krishnamurthy, Amplification Mechanisms in Liquidity Crises," Northwestern, mimeo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunnermeier, Markus and [[Lasse Heje Pedersen|Lasse H. Pedersen]] (2008), "Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity," Review of Financial Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the "Balance Sheet Mechanism" described above, the lending channel can also dry up for reasons exogenous to the borrower's [[credit worthiness]]. For instance, banks may become concerned about their future access to capital markets in the event of a negative shock and may engage in '''precautionary hoarding''' of funds. This would result in reduction of funds available in the economy and a slowdown in economic activity. Additionally, the fact that most financial institutions are simultaneously engaged in lending and borrowing can give rise to a [[Network effect]].  In a setting that involves multiple parties, a gridlock can occur when concerns about counterparty [[credit risk]] result in failure to cancel out offsetting positions. Each party then has to hold additional funds to protect itself against the risks that are not netted out, reducing liquidity in the market. These mechanisms may explain the 'gridlock'  observed in the [[interbank lending market]] during the recent subprime crisis, when banks were unwilling to lend to each other and instead hoarded their reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnermeier, Markus and [[Lasse Heje Pedersen|Lasse H. Pedersen]] (2008), "Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity," Review of Financial Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides, a liquidity crisis may even result due to ''uncertainty'' associated with market activities. Typically, market participants jump on the [[financial innovation]] bandwagon, often before they can fully apprehend the risks associated with new financial assets. Unexpected behaviour of such new financial assets can lead to market participants disengaging from risks they don't understand and investing in more liquid or familiar assets. This can be described as the '''Information Amplification Mechanism'''. In the subprime mortagage crisis, rapid endorsement and later abandonment of complicated [[structured finance]] products such as [[collateralized debt obligation]]s, [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]], etc. played a pivotal role in amplifying the effects of a drop in property prices.&lt;ref&gt;Caballero, Ricardo J. and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008), "Collective Risk Management in a Flight to Quality Episode," Journal of Finance 63(5)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Amplification Mechanisms in Liquidity Crises," Northwestern, mimeo&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liquidity crises and asset prices ==

Many asset prices drop significantly during liquidity crises. Hence, asset prices are subject to [[liquidity risk]] and risk-averse investors naturally require higher expected return as compensation for this risk. The liquidity-adjusted CAPM pricing model therefore states that, the higher an asset's market-liquidity risk, the higher its required return.&lt;ref&gt;Viral Acharya and Lasse Heje Pedersen, "Asset pricing with liquidity risk."  Journal of Financial Economics 77, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Liquidity crises such as the [[Liquidity crisis of September 2008]] and the [[LTCM]] crisis of 1998 also result in deviations from the [[Law of one price]], meaning that almost identical securities trade at different prices. This happens when investors are financially constrained and liquidity spirals affect more securities that are difficult to borrow against. Hence, a security's margin requirement can affect its value.&lt;ref&gt;
See Geanakoplos (1997), "Promises, Promises," In: The Economy as an Evolving Complex System II, Addison Wesley Longman, pp. 285–320 and Garleanu and Pedersen (2011), "Margin-Based Asset Pricing and Deviations from the Law of One Price," The Review of Financial Studies, 24(6), 1980-2022, http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/%7Elpederse/papers/MarginPricingLoOP.pdf . Garleanu and Pedersen (2011) derive a Margin Capital Asset Pricing Model (Margin CAPM) that shows how larger margin requirements are associated with higher required returns.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liquidity crunch and flight to liquidity ==

A phenomenon frequently observed during liquidity crises is [[flight to liquidity]] as investors exit illiquid investments and turn to secondary markets in pursuit of cash–like or easily saleable assets. Empirical evidence points towards widening price differentials, during periods of liquidity shortage, among assets that are otherwise alike, but differ in terms of their asset market liquidity. For instance, there are often large liquidity premia (in some cases as much as 10-15%) in [[Treasury bond]] prices. An example of a flight to liquidity occurred during the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]], when the price of Treasury bonds sharply rose relative to less liquid debt instruments. This resulted in widening of credit spreads and major losses at [[Long-Term Capital Management]] and many other hedge funds.&lt;ref&gt;Longstaff, Francis A. 2004. "The Flight-to-Liquidity Premium in U.S. Treasury Bond Prices." Journal of Business, 77(3): 511–26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caballero, Ricardo J. and Arvind Krishnamurthy (2008), "Collective Risk Management in a Flight to Quality Episode," Journal of Finance 63(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role for policy ==

There exists scope for government policy to alleviate a liquidity crunch, by absorbing less liquid assets and in turn providing the private sector with more liquid government – backed assets, through the following channels:

'''Pre-emptive or ex-ante policy:''' Imposition of minimum [[Equity (finance)|equity]]:[[Financial capital|capital]] requirements or ceilings on [[debt-to-equity ratio]] on financial institutions other than commercial banks would lead to more resilient balance sheets. In the context of the [[Diamond–Dybvig model]], an example of a demand deposit contract that mitigates banks' vulnerability to bank runs, while allowing them to be providers of liquidity and optimal risk sharing, is one that entails '''suspension of [[convertibility]] ''' when there are too many withdrawals. For instance, consider a contract which is identical to the pure demand deposit contract, except that it states that a depositor will not receive anything on a given date if he attempts to prematurely withdraw, after a certain fraction of the bank's total deposits have been withdrawn. Such a contract has a unique [[Nash Equilibrium]] which is stable and achieves optimal risk sharing.

'''Expost policy intervention:''' Some experts suggest that the Central Bank should provide downside insurance in the event of a liquidity crisis. This could take the form of direct provision of insurance to asset-holders against losses or a commitment to purchasing assets in the event that the asset price falls below a threshold. Such 'Asset Purchases' will help drive up the demand and consequently the price of the asset in question, thereby easing the liquidity shortage faced by borrowers. Alternatively, the Government could provide 'deposit insurance', where it guarantees that a promised return will be paid to all those who withdraw. In the framework of the Diamond Dybvig model, demand deposit contracts with government deposit insurance help achieve the optimal equilibrium if the Government imposes an optimal tax to finance the deposit insurance. Alternative mechanisms through which the Central Bank could intervene are direct injection of equity into the system in the event of a liquidity crunch or engaging in a  [[debt for equity swap]]. It could also lend through the [[discount window]] or other lending facilities, providing credit to distressed financial institutions on easier terms. Ashcraft, Garleanu, and Pedersen (2010) argue that controlling the credit supply through such lending facilities with low margin requirements is an important second monetary tool (in addition to the interest rate tool), which can raise asset prices, lower bond yields, and ease the funding problems in the financial system during crises.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Ashcraft, Nicolae Garleanu, and Lasse H. Pedersen (2010), "Two Monetary Tools: Interest Rates and Haircuts," NBER Macroeconomics Annual, 25, 143-180. http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~lpederse/papers/TwoMonetaryTools.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While there are such benefits of intervention, there is also costs. It is argued by many economists that if the [[Central Bank]] declares itself as a 'Lender of Last Resort' (LLR), this might result in a [[moral hazard]] problem, with the private sector becoming lapse and this may even exacerbate the problem. Many economists therefore assert that the LLR must only be employed in extreme cases and must be a discretion of the Government rather than a rule.&lt;ref&gt;"Amplification Mechanisms in Liquidity Crises," Northwestern, mimeo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caballero, Ricardo J., and Pablo Kurat. 2009. "Public-Private Partnerships for Liquidity Provision&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liquidity crisis in emerging markets ==

It has been argued by some economists that financial liberalization and increased inflows of foreign capital, especially if short term, can aggravate illiquidity of banks and increase their vulnerability. In this context, 'International Illiquidity' refers to a situation in which a country's short term financial obligations denominated in foreign/hard currency exceed the amount of foreign/hard currency that it can obtain on a short notice. Empirical evidence reveals that weak fundamentals alone cannot account for all foreign capital outflows, especially from [[emerging markets]]. [[Open economy]] extensions of the Diamond – Dybvig Model, where runs on domestic deposits interact with foreign [[creditor]] panics (depending on the maturity of the foreign debt and the possibility of international default), offer a plausible explanation for the financial crises that were observed in Mexico, East Asia, Russia etc. These models assert that international factors can play a particularly important role in increasing domestic financial vulnerability and likelihood of a liquidity crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Chang and Andres Velasco (May, 2001), "A Model of Financial Crises in Emerging Markets ", The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

The onset of capital outflows can have particularly destabilising consequences for emerging markets. Unlike the banks of advanced economies, which typically have a number of potential investors in the world capital markets, ''informational frictions'' imply that investors in emerging markets are 'fair weather friends'. Thus self – fulfilling panics akin to those observed during a bank run, are much more likely for these economies. Moreover, policy distortions in these countries work to magnify the effects of adverse shocks. Given the limited access of emerging markets to world capital markets, illiquidity resulting from contemporaneous loss of domestic and foreign investor confidence is nearly sufficient to cause a financial and currency crises, the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]  being one example.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Roberto and Andres Velasco (1999), "Liquidity Crises in Emerging Markets: Theory and Policy," in NBER Macroeconomics Annual 1999, edited by Ben Bernanke and Julio Rotemberg, Cambridge: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chari, V.V. and Pat Kehoe (2003), "Hot Money," Journal of Political Economy 111, pp. 1262-1292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Chang and Andres Velasco (May, 2001), "A Model of Financial Crises in Emerging Markets ", The Quarterly Journal of Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften Berlin 2006 (flüssiger Stickstoff).jpg|thumbnail|The event at [[TU Berlin]] in 2006.]]

The '''Long Night of the Sciences''' ({{lang-de|'''Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften'''}}) has become an established form of [[public relations]] activity in Germany. On one night of the year, large scientific institutions hold lectures and demonstrations for the general public in order to present themselves and a general overview of their research topics. The events cover all aspects of science, from natural sciences to social sciences. The public can usually visit the institutions between around 5pm and 1am on the "Long Night of the Sciences" in exchange for a fee.

== Origin ==

The format of the event is inspired by the successful [[Long Night of Museums]] in [[Berlin]]. The event first took place as part of the Science Summer 2000 ({{lang-de|'''Wissenschaftssommer 2000'''}}) event in [[Bonn]]. Berlin organized a similar event the following year and gained a larger response, with a total of {{formatnum:61972}} visitors.

== Distribution ==

[[File:Nacht der Wissenschaft 2007.JPG|thumbnail|Advertisement for the event in the Rhine-Neckar metropolitan region]]

Besides Berlin, this event format has also been successfully implemented in other scientific locations, including:

* [[Hamburg]] (since 2005)
* [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] (since 2001)
* [[Dresden]] (since 2002)
* [[Rostock]]
* [[Aachen]] (since 2003)
* [[Nuremberg]]/[[Fürth]]/[[Erlangen]] (since 2003)
* [[Tübingen]], [[Jena]] (since 2005)
* [[Stuttgart]] (2006)
* [[Erfurt]], [[Duisburg]]-[[Essen]] (since 2007)
* [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]] (since 2007)
* [[Heidelberg]], [[Mannheim]], [[Ludwigshafen]] (since 2007)
* [[Garching bei München|Garching]] (since 2007)
* [[Leipzig]] (since 2008)
* [[Magdeburg]]
* [[Frankfurt]]

== Berlin and Potsdam ==

The program for the 9th "Long Night of the Sciences" in Berlin and [[Potsdam]] on 13 June 2009  featured more than {{formatnum:2000}} individual events held by 67 participants in 160 buildings. 15 special bus routes were provided for the night. There were around {{formatnum:238750}} visitors in total.

== Nuremberg, Fürth, Erlangen ==

"The Long Night of the Sciences" in the region of Nuremberg, Fürth and Erlangen is held every two years and offers events in the fields of natural sciences, technology, medicine and health as well as social, cultural and economic sciences. The event, which started in 2003, will open its doors for the seventh time on Saturday 24 October 2015. The goal is to build a bridge between research and public. The program contains a wide range of exhibitions, experiments and presentations - hosted by more than 300 institutions including the six regional universities as well as innovative companies and local establishments. In the afternoon there is also a special program for children. During the night the participating institutions will be connected by a special bus service driving ten different routes.

In 2013 there had been registered more than 30.000 participants on 130 locations. Most of the visitors were younger than 30 years.

==Career==
An Eric Trump Foundation staff biography of Patton states that she was involved in casting the 2012 and 2014 seasons of ''[[The Celebrity Apprentice]]''.&lt;ref name="ETFBIO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirkland|first1=Allegra|title=Trump's Onetime Rivals Resurface For RNC's 'Make America First Again' Night|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/speakers-convention-make-america-first-again-night|work=[[Talking Points Memo]]|accessdate=November 16, 2017|date=July 20, 2016|quote=played a key role in casting the 2012 and 2014 seasons of "The Celebrity Apprentice."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Marching Song''''' is a play about the legend of abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], written in 1932 by [[Orson Welles]] and Roger Hill. It is most notable for its narrative device of a journalist piecing together a man's life through multiple, contradictory recollections—a framework that Welles would famously employ in his 1941 film, ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.&lt;ref name="Gilpin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilpin |first=R.

==History==

In March 1932, two months shy of his 17th birthday, Orson Welles returned to Chicago from his post-graduation trip to Europe and his time with the [[Gate Theatre]] in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=March 18, 1932 |title=Chicago Schoolboy Who Won Place on Dublin Stage Returns |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1932/03/18/page/17/article/costume-jewelry-inspired-by-leis-of-pacific-isles |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |location= |access-date=2016-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding that he had few prospects despite his success in Ireland,&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brady |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Brady (writer) |title=Citizen Welles: A Biography of Orson Welles |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |location=New York |date=1989 |isbn=0-385-26759-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|38–39}} Welles persuaded Roger Hill, his former teacher and lifelong friend, to collaborate with him on a biographical play about abolitionist John Brown and his efforts to organize a slave revolt in 1859. In May, Welles visited [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|Harper's Ferry]] and other historic sites with Hill, who was leading a two-week field trip for boys attending the [[Todd Seminary for Boys|Todd School]].&lt;ref name="McGilligan"/&gt;{{Rp|218–219}} In August, Welles retreated to [[Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin]], and stayed at the summer home of James B. Meigs and his family while he wrote the play.&lt;ref name="McGilligan"/&gt;{{Rp|220–221}} Welles typed a cover page that credits the play as being by "Orson Welles and Roger Hill"; Hill said he wrote only a few scenes that Welles edited and reworked.&lt;ref name="McGilligan"/&gt;{{Rp|223, 226}} 

"My own contribution to writing that play was a first draft of a first act," Hill recalled. "In other words, just enough to start our tireless boy off and, more importantly, ''send'' him off. Out of my hair."&lt;ref name="Time and Chance"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill |first=Roger |date=1977 |title=One Man's Time and Chance, a Memoir of Eighty Years 1895 to 1975 |url=http://lookatillinois.info/content/one-mans-time-and-chance-memoir-eighty-years-1895-1975-cover |location= |publisher=Privately printed; Woodstock Public Library collection, digitized by Illinois State Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|119}}

==Production==

Though Welles's complete playscript for ''Marching Song'' has not been produced,&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt; the Todd School for Boys presented an abbreviated world premiere of the play June 7–8, 1950, at the [[Woodstock Opera House]]. Hascy Tarbox, Welles's Todd School classmate and Hill's son-in-law, trimmed the four-hour play to two hours and staged the two performances for the benefit of the Woodstock Hospital.&lt;ref name="Tarbox"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time and Chance"/&gt;{{Rp|119}}

On September 30, 1985, Hill told Welles that he had located his own copy of the play, which he planned to give him. "For my money it remains a compelling, if overly long, play.

Since 2010, [[Fashion Week]] producers in [[New_York_Fashion_Week|New York]], [[London_Fashion_Week|London]], [[Paris_fashion_week |Paris]] and Vancouver have pushed to expand the realm of Fashion Week by creating a [[Men's Fashion Week|separate Fashion Week (weekend or day) for menswear]] fashion designers and retail brands.  Los Angeles is the 5th in the world to develop a Fashion Week for menswear, succeeding [[New_York_Fashion_Week|New York]], [[London_Fashion_Week|London]], [[Paris_fashion_week |Paris]] and Vancouver.

During Men’s Fashion Week LA (MFWLA), menswear fashion designers and retail brands present their latest collections to industry insiders—press, media, bloggers, buyers, stylists, high-profile guests and fashion occult. Men’s Fashion Week LA is held twice a year: January (Autumn/Winter); and June (Spring/Summer).  The one-week event is held a few days preceding the traditional (women’s) [[Los Angeles Fashion Week]].
  
Men’s Fashion Week Los Angeles was created to provide a platform for the evolving menswear apparel segment.  MFWLA fuses fashion week runway shows, trade show style exhibits and market week type custom pop-up showrooms.  Men’s Fashion Week Los Angeles’ calendar is generally composed of designer runway shows, one department store showcase, one emerging talent student showcase, launch parties and the like. MFWLA also features press installations.

Additional amenities found at Men’s Fashion Week LA are a “Gentry Suite”, “Cigar Lounge”, “Pop-Up Barber Shop”, “Gaming Suite” and a “Bow Tie Technique Suite”.

To reflect the original working-name, “Gentlemen’s Week”, a bow tie was linked to the company logo.  The bow tie personifies MFWLA’s company philosophy, which (as indicated by the company website) was founded on honor and civility among aesthete gentlemen.

'''''Minggu Pagi''''' (Indonesian for ''Sunday Morning'') is an Indonesian general interest weekly published by the [[Yogyakarta]]-based [[Kedaulatan Rakyat|Kedaulatan Rakyat Group]]. It began in 1948 as a magazine, switching to the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid format]] in the 1980s.

==History==
[[File:Minggu Pagi 6.45 (7 February 1954) cover.jpg|thumb|Cover of the ''Minggu Pagi'' magazine (7 February 1954), featuring the actress [[Lies Noor]]]]
''Minggu Pagi'' was established as a magazine in the central [[Java]]n city of [[Yogyakarta]] on 7 December 1948 by M. Wonohito and H. Samawi; the former was the editor in chief of the newspaper ''[[Kedaulatan Rakyat]]''.{{Sfn|Swift|1989|p=170}}{{sfn|Ministry of Education, Minggu Pagi}} Afterwards, the magazine did not publish again until 1950. The issues published through early 1951 were listed as Volume&amp;nbsp;2. In April 1953 ''Minggu Pagi'' jumped from Volume&amp;nbsp;4 to Volume&amp;nbsp;6, thus bringing the number of volumes in-line with the years since the magazine was established.{{sfn|Kratz|1988|p=827}}

During a period of [[hyperinflation]] in [[Economic_history_of_Indonesia#Sukarno_presidency|the early 1960s]], ''Minggu Pagi'' ceased publication as a standalone magazine. It was reduced to eight pages and included as a supplemental with the newspaper ''Kedaulatan Rakyat''; as a result, the magazine's subscribers were required to pay extra for the newspaper. As the economy improved in the 1970s, ''Minggu Pagi'' was again issued as a stand-alone publication.{{sfn|Ministry of Education, Minggu Pagi}} It ultimately migrated to the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid format]] in the 1980s.{{sfn|USIS|1992|p=77}} 

In 1992 the [[United States Information Service]] described ''Minggu Pagi'', which by then consisted of twelve pages, as one of the oldest extant press publications in Indonesia.{{sfn|USIS|1992|p=77}} At this time it was one of several media published by [[Kedaulatan Rakyat|Kedaulatan Rakyat Group]], together with the newspaper ''[[Kedaulatan Rakyat]]'', the children's magazine ''Gatotkaca'', and the [[Javanese language|Javanese-language]] magazine ''Mekar Sari''.{{sfn|USIS|1992|p=46}} 

==Contents==
In its early years, ''Minggu Pagi'' included articles on a variety of topics, including science, film, traditional culture, tourism, and sports. It also included space for literary works, primarily short stories. Among short story writers and other authors, the magazine was seen as providing an alternative space for publication, one accessible to those who had not yet been recognized by the Jakarta-based "rulers"&lt;!--''penguasa'' in the original--&gt; of the Indonesian literary canon.{{sfn|Ministry of Education, Minggu Pagi}} Given this opportunity, as well as the honorariums paid to authors, ''Minggu Pagi'' soon became a popular medium in which local writers could publish their works.{{sfn|Derks|2002|p=333}} 

In the 1950s, the Indonesian author {{Interlanguage link multi|Nasjah Djamin|id}} described ''Minggu Pagi'', as a "cesspool", a descriptor that the academic Will Derks characterises as "embracing the low status and insignificance [the magazine] might have had in the eyes of scholars and critics".{{sfn|Derks|2002|p=333}} Nevertheless, by 1988 more than four hundred writers had contributed their literary works to the magazine and its successor. These included [[Motinggo Busye]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Satyagraha Hoerip|id}}, [[Rendra]], [[Bakri Siregar]], and Djamin, who published his novel ''Hilanglah Si Anak Hilang'' in ''Minggu Pagi'' between 1960 and 1961 on request of the editors.{{efn|The novel was published in Volume 13, issues 39–42 {{harv|Kratz|1988|p=158}}.}}{{sfn|Derks|2002|p=333}}{{sfn|Kratz|1988|pp=158, 862–864}}

In the 1990s, ''Minggu Pagi'' had a column on sexuality, "Liku-Lika Seksualitas", managed by a "Dr. Rosi".{{sfn|Budiman|2000|p=55}} It also regularly featured information on miraculous healing, sacred sites, and invulnerability practices.{{Sfn|Browne|1999|p=90}}

'''Parapotamii''' or '''Parapotamioi''' ({{lang-grc|Παραποτάμιοι}})&lt;ref name=Strabo&gt;{{Cite Strabo|9.2.19, 9.3.16, 9.3.16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pausanias&gt;{{Cite Pausanias|10|3|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Parapotamia''' (Παραποταμία),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Stephanus|''s.v.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; both meaning near the river, was a town of [[ancient Phocis]] on the left bank of the [[Cephissus (Boeotia)|Cephissus]] (whence its name), and near the frontier of [[ancient Boeotia|Boeotia]]. Its position is described in a passage of [[Theopompus]], preserved by [[Strabo]], who says that it stood at a distance of 40 [[stadion (unit)|stadia]] from [[Chaeroneia]], in the entrance from Boeotia into Phocis, on a height of moderate elevation, situated between [[Parnassus]] and Mount Hedylium; he adds that these two mountains were separated from each other by an interval of 5 stadia, through which the Cephissus flowed.&lt;ref name=Strabo/&gt; The Cephissus flowed into the territory of Parapotamii after leaving that of Elateia and before that of [[Panopeus]]; Parapotamii's territory was adjacent to those of [[Ambrysus (Phocis)|Ambrysus]], Panopeus, and [[Daulis]].&lt;ref name=Strabo/&gt; 

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] emphasized the great fertility of its area which was such that it was even said that the name of Parapotamii was the designation for those who had their crops next to Cephissus and that they referred to a verse of [[Homer]] in the ''[[Catalogue of Ships]]'' of the ''[[Iliad]]'' that read: "And those who dwelt by the divine river Cephissus"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Iliad|2.522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pausanias|10|33|7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], Parapotamii was one of the places destroyed by the [[Achaemenid]] army under [[Xerxes I]] in 480&amp;nbsp;BCE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Herodotus|8.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 395&amp;nbsp;BCE, its territory was sacked by the [[ancient Boeotia|Boeotians]], who however were unsuccessful in their attempt to assault the city.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hellenica Oxyrhynchia]]'' 21.5.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the cities devastated by [[Philip II of Macedon]] at the conclusion of the [[Third Sacred War]].&lt;ref name=Pausanias/&gt; Pausanias mentions that, during the first [[Pythian Games]] (582&amp;nbsp;BCE) organized by the [[Delphic Amphictyony]], in the youth boxing, Ecmeas of Parapotamii was a victor. He adds that after its destruction it was not rebuilt and that in his time (2nd century) there were no more ruins and no one remembered the exact place where it was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pausanias|10|33|8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] in his life of Sulla speaks of the acropolis of the deserted city, which he describes as a stony height surrounded with a precipice and separated from Mt. Hedylium only by the river Assus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Sulla'', 100.16&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of Parapotamii is near the modern village of Belesi (Levendi).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DARE|29427}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Barrington|55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22475">The number of '''personal watercraft-related accidents''' has increased with the popularity of [[personal watercraft]] (PWC) (also commonly known as jet skis) since their introduction during the late 1960s. The use of the term "jet ski" for all types of PWCs is a [[misnomer]]; [[Jet Ski]] is a [[Trademark|registered trademark]] in the United States for a line of PWCs manufactured by [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0913875791 | title = Boat Accident Reconstruction and Litigation | last1 = Rickman | first1 = Roy Scott |author2=Michael M. Sampsel, Jeanne-Marie D. van Hemmen | year = 1996 | publisher = Lawyers and Judges Publishing | page = 68  }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increased use of personal watercraft since their inception, the hazards accompanying their use have also increased. According to U.S. government reports, most accidents are associated with rental operators, underage operators, under-trained and undereducated boaters and a variety of factors associated with recreational-boating accidents (excessive speed, inattention, reckless operation, alcohol consumption and violations of the "Rules of the Road").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caufield|first=T.G.|title=A Beginner's Guide to the Rules of the Road|year=2001|publisher=Great Lakes Marine Transportation LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rules&gt;Almost all bodies of water in the United States are governed by the Inland Navigation Rules or their state law equivalents. These "rules" are typically referred to as the "rules of the road."&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their affordability, ease of use, and relatively low transportation and maintenance costs, personal watercraft have significantly increased the number of water-based enthusiasts in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This rise in participation has created conflicts between the various boating segments in the U.S. and a need for additional boater education. Recreational-boating accidents are the second-largest transportation-related cause of injury in the U.S. (after automobile accidents).&lt;ref name=accidents&gt;NTSB Boating Safety Report (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|PWC}}Background ==
Personal watercraft are vessels designed for recreational use on the water, carrying between one and four passengers. The [[U.S. Coast Guard]] defines PWC as "craft less than 13 feet in length designed to be operated by a person or persons sitting, standing or kneeling on the craft rather than within the confines of a hull".&lt;ref name=osix&gt;"Boating Statistics 2006." {{cite web |url=http://www.uscgboating.org/statistics/Boating_Statistics_2006.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902191629/http://www.uscgboating.org/statistics/boating_statistics_2006.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-02 |df= }} Retrieved on December 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The original PWCs were manufactured during the mid-1950s in the United Kingdom and Europe. Ten years later Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP) began manufacturing PWC's in the USA under the name [[Sea-Doo (disambiguation)|Sea-Doo]]. BRP left the PWC business shortly thereafter, and in 1973 Kawasaki introduced a "stand-up" watercraft designed for a single operator (with a tray for standing or kneeling, in place of a seat). By the late 1980s "sit-down" models had appeared on the market, allowing the rider to be seated (similar to a [[snowmobile]] or motorcycle seat). These sit-down models were made by Kawasaki (1986), [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] (1987) and BRP (1988). Polaris and Arctic were two American companies which entered the market during the early 1990s.

PWC have an [[Inboard motor|inboard engine]] with a screw-shaped [[impeller]] to create [[thrust]] and [[Marine propulsion|propulsion]] for steering. They are small, fast, and easy to maneuver; PWCs do not use external [[Propeller (marine)|propellers]], making them safer for swimmers and wildlife. The [[Usability|user-friendly]] properties of PWCs have contributed to the increase in popularity amongst less-experienced watercraft users. To increase safety, a number of U.S. [[Consumer organization|consumer groups]] suggested that all boats should utilize the jet-drive mechanism (also called a [[pump-jet]]) employed by PWC manufacturers since this would reduce the risk of propeller injuries.&lt;ref name=prop&gt;The Coast Guard's Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for houseboats provided that houseboats should either have a propeller guard installed or be converted to jet drive power.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accidents ==
All boating accidents in the United States either occur on state- or federally-patrolled waters.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Whether state or federal, reports must be filed for a predefined level of damage and are compiled by the [[United States Coast Guard]] (which uses the reported data for its annual BAR—Boating Accident Report—Statistical Reports). As automotive [[Law enforcement officer#United States|law-enforcement officers]] outnumber [[Water police#List of water police units|boating law-enforcement officers]] in the U.S., federal government reports for watercraft are comparatively fewer.&lt;ref name=rept&gt;As a general rule of thumb the Coast Guard believes that it receives about 10% of the "property damage only" accidents, but 90% of the serious personal injury accidents.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Transportation Safety Board|National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)]] conducted general investigation of the recreational-boating accident-reporting system in 1998 and compiled its findings in a published report.&lt;ref name=invt&gt;National Transportation Safety Board: Personal Watercraft Safety." 1998. http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/8000/8400/8418/SS9801.pdf Retrieved on December 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The NTSB's investigation emerged with data seen as representative of overall recreational boating; an example follows from the report's conclusion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Inattention (attributed to 307 operators), inexperience (attributed to 296 operators), and inappropriate speed for the operating conditions (attributed to 246 operators) were the most frequently cited causes that contributed to the PWC accidents. One or more of these three causes were associated with 70 percent of the 814 accidents. A fourth cause, improper lookout (153), was associated with about one-fifth of the accidents.&lt;ref name=causes&gt;Page 18-19 of NTSB Report (1998). This results in 90% of all accidents being attributed to improper lookout, inexperience, inappropriate speed and inattention. The remaining 10% of the accidents were mostly due to rules of the road infractions, weather or environmental conditions and other "unknown" causes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the aforementioned interpretation of the NTSB report: 
* The vast majority of accidents (over 90 percent) were caused by operator error.
* There is a significantly higher association with accidents for rental operators (nearly 25 percent) than is the case for the general boating population; however, this may be related to the higher percentage of rental operators.&lt;ref name=edu&gt;"The Safety Board is concerned about persons who rent PWC. Nearly one-quarter of the PWC operators involved in the 1997 accidents analyzed by the Safety Board for this study (292 of 1,218, or 24 percent) were operating rented PWC" NTSB Report (page 33)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The NTSB report did not conclude that PWCs are disproportionately represented in boating-accident statistics.&lt;ref name=accd&gt;"The study was not designed to estimate how often PWC accidents occur, nor are the results of the study necessarily representative of all PWC accidents". Page i.
"However, in 1994 the number of PWC fatalities began to increase noticeably because the number of PWCs in operation increased". Page v.
"The increase in PWC fatalities is proportional to the increase of PWC in operation." Page 2.
&lt;/ref&gt;

A study performed by the Red Cross in 1991 concluded that during the research period, PWC accidents were not disproportionate to their use by the boating population. This was later supported by a Coast Guard study presented to the State of Vermont in 1996. Both studies presented findings that the comparative accident rates for personal water craft were not [[wikt:disproportionate|disproportionate]] to their use by the boating population; the reports emphasized the high level of attention and publicity that PWC accidents receive.&lt;ref name=rates&gt;There is a difference between comparing the number accidents to the number of registrations, as opposed to comparing the number of accidents to the actual hours of use of the boats. Large yachts, which spend most of their time sitting at the marina, are less at risk of an accident due to the low hours of use.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1990s, several states (including [[California]] and [[Florida]], two [[wikt:jurisdiction|jurisdictions]] which, according to the NTSB report, accounted for over 50 percent of all personal-water-craft accidents in the U.S.) changed their laws regarding the use of personal water craft. These amendments included the introduction of limits for [[wake]]-jumping, the prescribed use of a PWC within {{convert|100|ft|m}} of another vessel, "spraying" activities,{{clarify|date=May 2012}} mandated operation of PWCs within {{convert|150|ft|m}} of the shoreline, and age restrictions for operators (the operator age was raised from 12 to 16 years for all affected states, with Florida also introducing a mandatory boating-safety course for those under age 18).&lt;ref name=sfty&gt;National Transportation Safety Board: Personal Watercraft Safety." 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the State of California, these laws have directly contributed to an over-50-percent reduction in accidents.&lt;ref name=cali&gt;See footnotes to accident discussion below. California Boating and Waterways 2004 Annual Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable fatality occurred on July 1, 2012 in Little Sabine Bay (near [[Pensacola Beach]]), [[Florida]]; retired [[astronaut]] [[Alan Poindexter]] was killed when the PWC he was riding was rammed by one operated by one of his sons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/48043840/ns/today-today_tech/t/ex-astronaut-alan-poindexter-dies-jet-ski-accident/#.T_cxrtWLM4Q Ex-astronaut Alan Poindexter dies in jet ski accident]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

=== {{anchor|Reckless Driving}}Reckless driving ===
The leading cause of PWC accidents among riders in 2007 was reckless or careless driving.&lt;ref name=oseven&gt;"Boating Statistics 2006." http://www.uscgboating.org/statistics/Boating_Statistics_2007.pdf. Retrieved on December 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Transportation Safety Board in the U.S., this accounted for 26.3 percent of all PWCs involved in accidents in 2007.&lt;ref name=ntsb&gt;"National Transportation Safety Board: Personal Watercraft Safety." 1998. [http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/8000/8400/8418/SS9801.pdf] Retrieved on December 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Reckless driving has been defined in the Personal Watercraft Act of 2005 in the U.S. as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Every personal watercraft shall at all times be operated in a reasonable and prudent manner. No person shall operate a personal watercraft in an unsafe or reckless manner. Unsafe personal watercraft operation shall include, but not be limited to the following:&lt;br /&gt;
 (1) Becoming airborne or completely leaving the water while crossing the wake of another vessel within [100 feet] of the vessel creating the wake. &lt;br /&gt;Or wake jumping
      (2) Weaving through congested traffic.&lt;br /&gt;
      (3) Operating a vessel at greater than slow/no wake speed within [100 feet] of an anchored or moored vessel, shoreline, vessel underway, dock, pier, boat ramp, marina, swim float, marked swim area, person in the water, person(s) engaged in angling, or any {{Sic|?|hide=y|manually|-}}propelled vessel. &lt;br /&gt;
      (4) Operating contrary to the "Rules of the Road" or following too close to another vessel, including another personal watercraft. For the purposes of this section, following too close shall be construed as proceeding in the same direction and operating at a speed in excess of [10 MPH] when approaching within [100 feet] to the rear or [50 feet] to the side of another motorboat or sailboat which is underway unless such vessel is operating in a narrow channel, in which case a personal watercraft may operate at speed and flow of other vessel traffic.&lt;ref name=nasbla&gt;NASBLA MODEL ACT FOR PERSONAL WATERCRAFT http://www.nasbla.net/pdf/Model%20Acts/new/Personal%20Watercraft%2092105.pdf. Retrieved on December 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reckless driving is defined differently by state. For example, in Florida reckless driving on a PWC is defined as "maneuvering a personal watercraft by weaving through congested vessel traffic, jumping the wake of another vessel unreasonably close or when visibility around the vessel is obstructed, or swerving at the last possible moment to avoid collision is classified as reckless operation of a vessel".&lt;ref name=florida&gt;Florida Boating Laws Basic. http://www.boatus.org/onlinecourse/statelaws/Florida.html. Retrieved on December 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
In U.S. law, the penalties for operating a vessel in a negligent or reckless manner are defined as following:&lt;blockquote&gt;
(a) A person operating a vessel in a negligent manner or interfering with the safe operation of a vessel, so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of a person is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 in the case of a recreational vessel, or $25,000 in the case of any other vessel.&lt;br /&gt;
(b) A person operating a vessel in a grossly negligent manner that endangers the life, limb, or property of a person commits a class A misdemeanor.&lt;ref name=code&gt;"U.S. Code: Penalties for negligent operations and interfering with safe operation." https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/46/2302-. Retrieved on December 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== {{anchor|Driver Inattention}}Driver inattention ===
Because of the increasing popularity of water sports (particularly PWC), the number of vessels in use has increased in the last several decades. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, the number of registered vessels was 8,557,857 in 1980 and 12,875,568 in 2007.&lt;ref name=oseven/&gt; This has resulted in more-crowded waterways and increased hazards. Because of the increased congestion caused by the number of vessels, a heightened need for attention and caution is required by operators. In 2007, 17.2 percent of all PWC-related accidents were caused by driver inattention.&lt;ref name=oseven/&gt;

=== {{anchor|Excessive Speed}}Excessive speed ===
As the market has grown for PWC manufacturers, vessel power has also increased. Modern PWC engines have more than 250 horsepower and can reach speeds of over {{convert|70|mph}}.&lt;ref name=wave&gt;Yamaha Waverunner. http://www.yamaha-motor.com/waverunner/products/modelhome/580/0/home.aspx. Retrieved on December 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive speed accounted for nearly 15 percent of all PWC-related accidents in 2007, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.&lt;ref name=oseven/&gt;

=== {{anchor|Off Throttle Steering}}Off-throttle steering ===
The steering characteristics of jet boats (including personal watercraft) when they are "off throttle" seem to differ from conventional steering. All recreational planing boats steer with thrust. Jet boats (including PWCs) generate that thrust with a moveable nozzle connected to a jet pump; propeller boats generate thrust through a downward-placed, exposed propeller. The fact that the propeller is placed downward in the water and is exposed means that even when it is not generating thrust that some amount of steering effect is possible. Jet boats have no downward projection, and achieve no additional steering effect from the device. If the operator of a jet boat releases the throttle, steering effectiveness decreases roughly in proportion to  thrust reduction. The NTSB related an example of an off-throttle steering accident in the personal watercraft safety study of 1998: &lt;blockquote&gt;
The Florida Marine Patrol accident description states, "[Operator] was
attempting to make a turn south through a cut in the mangroves . . . . He was not real familiar with operating a jet ski with a passenger.  When he attempted to make a left turn he let off the throttle which caused the PWC to lose steering capabilities.  The forward momentum of the PWC took [operator] and passenger into the mangrove shoreline.
[Operator] received a puncture wound to the left side of his neck . . . ."&lt;ref name=ntsb/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the NTSB, 24 percent of reported PWC accidents list steering problems or loss of control as contributing factors;&lt;ref name=ntsb/&gt; in Florida, it is the second-leading cause of PWC-related accidents. PWC manufacturers have been working to develop a system to prevent off-throttle steering. Modifications have been made to solve this problem in newer PWC models.&lt;ref name=rideo&gt;Ride Technology: Off Throttle Steering http://www.ridetechnology.com/offThrottle.html. Retrieved on December 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Driver inexperience}}Driver inexperience ===
Because of the ease of operating a PWC, little training and experience is required to perform basic maneuvers of a PWC. The NTSB reported in 1998 that 32 percent of operators involved in accidents reported that they had operated a vessel between zero and ten times prior to the accident; 86 never, 75 once and 225 between 2 and 10 times. Of the 712 operators who were asked about training, 84 percent said they had received no training and the other 16 percent participated in some boating training.&lt;ref name=ntsb/&gt; Regulations concerning training courses and age limits for operators vary by state and by country. In the U.S. the minimum operator age ranges from 12–18 years; young operators may require adult supervision on the vessel and training in accordance with local laws.&lt;ref name=ntsb/&gt;

=== {{anchor|Conclusion}}Internal Orifice Injuries ===

One particularly serious type of personal watercraft injury occurs when a female rider falls off the back of the craft and into the path of the craft's high-pressure water jet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insiderexclusive.com/justice-in-america/dangerous-sports-the-personal-watercraft-industry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personalwatercraftinjuries.com|title=www.personalwatercraftinjuries.com|last=Mazzola|first=Brian|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The jet thrust is powerful enough to push water into the rider's orifices, which can result in severe internal injuries to the rider's vagina, rectum or anus, and possibly death.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insiderexclusive.com/justice-in-america/dangerous-sports-the-personal-watercraft-industry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personalwatercraftinjuries.com|title=www.personalwatercraftinjuries.com|last=Mazzola|first=Brian|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in 2014, the California Court of Appeal for the Fourth Appellate District, Division One upheld in full a [[San Diego County]] jury verdict against [[Bombardier Recreational Products]] and two other defendants in favor of two plaintiffs injured simultaneously in a single 2007 fall from a PWC, which included awards, respectively, of $3.385 million and $1.063 million in compensatory damages (with liability divided in equal portions among the three defendants).&lt;ref name="Colombo"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17317476377459507274 ''Colombo v. BRP US Inc.''], 230 Cal. App. 4th 1442; 179 Cal. Rptr. 3d 580 (2014).  As the appellate court explained in its opinion, this case was delayed after the PWC owner initiated a proceeding in federal court under the [[Limitation of Liability Act of 1851]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The appellate court also affirmed awards of $1.5 million in punitive damages against BRP alone for each plaintiff (adding up to $3 million in punitive damages) which were based on the jury's express finding that BRP's conduct manifested a "reckless or callous disregard for the rights of others".&lt;ref name="Colombo" /&gt;

However, on the other hand, there are also examples where the owner, operator, and/or user of the personal watercraft have been found entirely at fault by a jury without any fault whatsoever on the manufacturer.  For example, in 2010 in a case venued in the federal court of the Middle District of Florida, a jury found the 2006 Sea-Doo safe and not defective as to design, warnings, manufacture, and that BRP was not negligent in the design of its product.  &lt;ref&gt;See Christina Thomas v. Bombardier Recreational Products, Inc., CASE NO.: 2:07-CV-00730-JES-SPC (M.D. Fla. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  BRP maintained the Sea-Doo was reasonably safe, state-of-the-art, compliant with industry standards as well as the U.S. Coast Guard's standards, and was not the cause of plaintiff's injuries and/or accident.  The plaintiff testified she did not have any conversation with anyone concerning the use of protective gear, such as wet suit bottoms or equivalent protective clothing and was not provided any safety information before riding. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rumberger.com/?t=40&amp;an=4502&amp;format=xml&amp;p=4944&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, the operator admitted he saw, but chose not to read, the onboard warning label. He also admitted that he did not read the safety recommendations in the operator’s guide nor watch the safety video.  Counsel for BRP in the Thomas case, Scott Sarason, commented on the case that, “Statistically speaking, the probability of the type of incident involved in this case is extremely rare. Owners, operators and passengers of personal watercrafts must think safety first. It’s important for people to realize that these watercraft are classified as boats. That’s why the watercraft industry has been working diligently with authorities like the U.S. Coast Guard to introduce programs like ‘Know Before You Go’ in an effort to prevent accidents and injuries.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rumberger.com/?t=40&amp;an=4502&amp;format=xml&amp;p=4944&lt;/ref&gt; The Thomas case is just one example, of a handful, where such a rare accident is caused by extraneous persons or factors (including, but not limited to, the presence of alcohol, operator inexperience/inattention, careless or reckless operation, violation of state/local boating laws, failure on the part of the operator and/or owner to convey necessary safety information provided by the manufacturer, etc.).

The '''Puerto Rican Day Parade''' (also known as the '''National Puerto Rican Day Parade''') takes place annually in the United States along [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] in the [[Manhattan]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The parade is held on the second Sunday in June, in honor of the nearly four million inhabitants of [[Puerto Rico]] and all people of [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] birth or [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|heritage]] residing in the mainland U.S.

The parade attracts many celebrities, both Puerto Rican and of Puerto Rican heritage, and many politicians from the [[Tri-State area (NY-NJ-CT)|Tri-State area]].

The parade marches along Fifth Avenue from 44th Street to [[86th Street (Manhattan)|86th Street]] and has grown to become one of the largest parades in New York City, with nearly two million spectators annually making it one of the largest outdoor events in the United States.&lt;ref name="PRDAY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinrapper.com/prdayparade.html|title=2007 National Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York - Schedule of National &amp; NY Events|work=Latin Rapper|accessdate= April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the largest Puerto Rican cultural parade is in New York City, other cities with large Puerto Rican populations also have notable Puerto Rican parades and festivals, such as [[History of the Puerto Ricans in Philadelphia|Philadelphia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitphilly.com/events/philadelphia/puerto-rican-day-parade/|title=Annual Puerto Rican Day Parade — visitphilly.com|publisher=|accessdate=May 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prpcchicago.org/|title=口コミで話題のクレジットカード現金化サイト|website=www.prpcchicago.org|accessdate=May 30, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909052508/http://www.prpcchicago.org/|archivedate=September 9, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2014/07/28/puerto-rican-festival-of-mass-2014/|title=Puerto Rican Festival of Massachusetts 2014|first=Yadires|last=Nova-Salcedo|publisher=|accessdate=May 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ricky Martin at the National Puerto Rican Day Parade.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Ricky Martin]] as the parade's King in 2007]]
The first Puerto Rican Day Parade was held on Sunday, April 13, 1958, in [[Manhattan]], replacing the former [[Hispanic]] Day Parade. This move, part of the mission of the Catholic Archdiocese of New York (esp., Cardinal Spellman and Ivan Illich) represented a shift away from earlier attempts at "Yankeefication" toward culturally specific expressions based on traditional ''fiestas patronales''.&lt;ref&gt;http://solidarityhall.org/ivan-illichs-politics-of-carnival/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the parade became incorporated as the National Puerto Rican Day Parade and expanded beyond the parade venue itself. The parade now hosts over seven major events throughout the city.

There are dozens of other events that also take place the weekend of the parade that are not sponsored by the National Parade's corporation. One of the longest running is the street fair held one day prior to the parade. Though the size has changed over the years the heart of the parade has always been at 116th Street between Lexington and Second Avenues. In addition to the parade in New York City, there are currently over fifty smaller parades that take place throughout the United States.

The parade has attracted many New York politicians including mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], former mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] and Senator [[Charles Schumer]], as well as many political candidates running for office and looking for voters in local, state and national elections. In recent years, the parade has honored several Puerto Rican celebrities by naming them "International Grand Marshal" of the parade including singer [[Marc Anthony]], who participated in the parade along with his ex-wife [[Jennifer Lopez]], and [[Ricky Martin]] in 2007 and 2010.&lt;ref name="MARSHAL"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/12/nyregion/12parade.html?ex=1179460800&amp;en=0122f4d0329adb9f&amp;ei=5070|title=Swaying, and Marching, to a Latin Beat|work=[[The New York Times]] |date= June 12, 2006 |author=Santos, Fernanda|accessdate= April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, organizers selected internationally recognized [[telenovela]] actor [[Osvaldo Ríos]], as the parade's "Special Guest Star".

In addition to a National Grand Marshal, a variety of honorees are named for the parade, with titles such as "King", "National Ambassador of La Salsa", and "National Godmother".&lt;ref name="HONOREES"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpuertoricandayparade.org/|title=National - เทคนิคพนันบอล|website=www.nationalpuertoricandayparade.org|accessdate=May 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2004, Puerto Rican rapper [[Ivy Queen]] was designated as the "Puerto Rico Youth Godmother" of the parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2004/06/prweb130638.htm|title=Reggeton Diva Ivy Queen Announces Her Tour Calendar for the Month of June|author= Press release| publisher = [[Perfect Image Records]] (via [[PRWeb]]) |date= June 3, 2004|accessdate= April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others to be given such titles include [[Wisin &amp; Yandel]] and [[Willie Colón]].&lt;ref name="MARSHAL" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[File:PR Day parade 5 Av 53 St Fendi Coors jeh.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Scene from the 2011 parade]]
The parade itself has been featured in an episode of the [[NBC]] [[situation comedy]] ''[[Seinfeld]]'' titled "[[The Puerto Rican Day]]". In it, [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry Seinfeld]], [[George Costanza]], [[Elaine Benes]], and [[Cosmo Kramer]] get stuck in a traffic jam as a result of the parade. Due to controversy relating to a scene in which Kramer accidentally burns and then stomps on a [[Flag of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican flag]] and is chased by a mob of angry Puerto Ricans, NBC refused to air the episode again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gothamist.com/2007/06/09/pr_1.php|title=Puerto Rican Day Parade This Sunday|work=[[Gothamist]]|author=Hogarty, Dave|date=June 9, 2007|accessdate=April 10, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521034107/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/09/pr_1.php|archivedate=May 21, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was also withheld from [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] as a result, but has been shown sparingly in syndicated repeats since 2002 and has been released on [[DVD]] along with all of the sitcom's episodes.

The parade was portrayed in a negative aspect following the controversial 2000 parade in a 2001 episode of the long-running [[NBC]] crime series ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' titled "[[Sunday in the Park with Jorge]]". Before the National Puerto Rican Coalition protested the episode, network executives issued an apology. The company also made a pledge to "improve our procedures regarding sensitive programming issues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4576751.html|title='Law' Producer Says NBC Caved: Criticizes Apology over Puerto Rican Episode|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Andreeva, Nellie|date= January 30, 2001 |accessdate= April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1994, Latin American literary classic ''[[Braschi's Empire of Dreams|Empire of Dreams]]'' by [[Giannina Braschi]] staged a revolution on the Puerto Rican Day Parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hispanicny.com/2012/06/puerto-rican-day-parade-prose-poem-by.html|title= Puerto Rican Day Parade |work=Hispanic New York |author=Remeseira, Claudio|date= June 10, 2012 |accessdate= October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parade has been referenced on the [[Tru TV]] show ''[[Impractical Jokers]]'' within multiple episodes, satirically introduced as a joke about castmember [[Sal Vulcano]]'s heritage, which is Cuban, but often mistaken for Mexican or Puerto Rican.

In June 2010, controversy arose after organizers selected [[telenovela]] actor [[Osvaldo Ríos]], who served three months in a Puerto Rican prison in 2004 for assaulting his former girlfriend after a [[domestic violence|domestic-violence]] incident as the parade's "International Godfather". Many confirmed participants such as U.S. Representative [[Luis Guiterrez]] and corporate sponsors such as [[Verizon]] withdrew their participation and endorsements due to his controversial past. After mounting pressure from both the media, politicians, public officials, and domestic violence organizations, Rios decided to not attend the parade after discussing the matter with his children and U.S. Congresswoman [[Nydia Velasquez]]. He was replaced at the last minute by singer Marc Anthony, who was accompanied by his then wife Jennifer Lopez.&lt;ref&gt;(June 8, 2010). [http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/06/08/2010-06-08_soap_star_osvaldo_rios_quits_as_puerto_rican_parade_godfather_over_his_history_o.html "Soap Star Osvaldo Rios Quits as Puerto Rican Parade 'Godfather' over His History of Violence"].

In past interviews, actor and comedian [[John Leguizamo]] had always claimed Puerto Rican ancestry via his father's side, which was one of the reasons that he was selected as the 2011 Puerto Rican Day Parade Global Ambassador of the Arts. On June 10, 2011, Leguizamo's father, Albert, declared in an interview published in ''[[El Diario La Prensa]]'', the largest Spanish-language newspaper in New York, that he was not Puerto Rican - but rather, of Colombian ancestry. This contradicted his son's past claims of Puerto Rican ancestry.&lt;ref name="FN"&gt;[http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2011/06/10/leguizamos-dad-johns-not-puerto-rican/ "Leguizamo's Dad: John's Not Puerto Rican!"].

A spokesman for the National Puerto Rican Day Parade stated that despite his shifting ancestry, Leguizamo would not be stripped of his ambassadorship, and would be allowed to participate in the June 2011 parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Huge Crowd for Puerto Rican Parade|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8184052| publisher = [[WABC-TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Albizu Campos===
The theme of the 2015 parade had a strong historical focus. The year 2015 marks the 50th anniversary of the death of [[Pedro Albizu Campos]], who spent 25 years in prison and dedicated his entire life to the independence of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;Legrineire, Pedro (June 8, 2014).

Historical figures including [[Harry Houdini]], [[Evelyn Nesbit]], [[Booker T. Washington]], [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Henry Ford]], [[Stanford White]], [[Harry Kendall Thaw]], [[Admiral Peary]], [[Matthew Henson]], and [[Emma Goldman]] are represented in the stories.

==Productions==

===Original Broadway production===
The musical had its world premiere in [[Toronto]], where it opened at the Ford Centre for the Performing Arts (later renamed the [[Toronto Centre for the Arts]]) on December 8, 1996, &lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Andrea. [http://www.playbill.com/article/casting-finalized-for-ragtime-leads-com-68119# "Casting Finalized for 'Ragtime' Leads"] Playbill, July 12, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; produced by Canadian impresario [[Garth Drabinsky]] and his [[Livent]] Inc., the Toronto-production company he headed.&lt;ref&gt;Within a year of ''Ragtime'' 's Broadway opening, Livent would go bankrupt, and Drabinsky would later be convicted of fraud for activities related to his operation of the company.&lt;/ref&gt; The US premiere was at the Shubert Theatre, Los Angeles in June 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Haithman, Dianne.

Directed by [[Frank Galati]] and choreographed by [[Graciela Daniele]], ''Ragtime'' closed on January 16, 2000 after 834 performances and 27 previews.  The original cast included [[Brian Stokes Mitchell]], [[Marin Mazzie]], [[Peter Friedman]] and [[Audra McDonald]], who were all nominated for [[Tony Award]]s, and also included [[Judy Kaye]], [[Mark Jacoby]] and [[Lea Michele]].  The production was conducted by [[David Loud]].

The production received mixed reviews, with critics noting that the dazzling physical production (with a $10 million budget, including fireworks and a working [[Model T]] automobile) overshadowed problems in the script. [[Ben Brantley]]'s review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' was headlined "A diorama with nostalgia rampant."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben. [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/19/theater/theater-review-ragtime-a-diorama-with-nostalgia-rampant.html "Theater Review; 'Ragtime': A Diorama With Nostalgia Rampant"] ''The New York Times'', January 19, 1998, retrieved September 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It led the 1998 [[Tony Awards]] with thirteen Tony Award nominations, but [[Disney|Disney's]] ''[[The Lion King (Broadway musical)|The Lion King]]'' won as Best Musical. The musical won awards for Best Featured Actress (McDonald), Original Score, Book, and Orchestrations.  According to ''The New York Times'', "The chief competition for ''The Lion King'' was ''Ragtime'', a lavish musical."&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, Rick. "'Art' Wins Best Play in Tonys; 'Lion King' Gets Best Musical", ''The New York Times'', June 8, 1998, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Times'' also noted that "The season was an artistic success as well, creating one of the most competitive Tony contests in years, with a battle in almost every category capped by the titanic struggle for the best musical award between ''Ragtime'' with 13 nominations and ''The Lion King'' with 11."&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, Rick. "The Broadway Season's Last Hurrah, Live From Radio City Music Hall",  ''The New York Times'', June 5, 1998, p. E1&lt;/ref&gt; The Broadway production was not financially successful, and some Broadway insiders consider its lavish production to have been the financial "undoing" of [[Livent]].&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbaum, Ken.

===International productions===

====Original West End production====
Following its European premiere in a concert performance at the [[Cardiff]] International Festival of Musical Theatre in 2002 (which was later telecast on [[BBC Four]]), the musical was produced in the [[West End theatre|West End]], London, by [[Sonia Friedman]] at the [[Piccadilly Theatre]] for a Limited Run from 19 March 2003 - 14 June 2003. This production starred [[Maria Friedman]] in the role of Mother, for which she won the 2004 [[Olivier Award]] for Best Actress in a Musical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albemarle-london.com/awards/AwardWinners.php?Award_Type=Laurence%20Olivier%20Awards&amp;Year=2004 "2004 Oliver Award Winners and Nominations (for 2003 season)"], albemarle.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Original Norwegian production====
The musical theatre company BærMuDa premiered the first Scandinavian production on January 18, 2018, coincidentally on the day of the musical's twenty year anniversary of the first night on Broadway. It was also the first time the musical was performed in a foreign language. The production was directed by Renate Stridh, and the cast featured Mimmi Tamba (Sarah), Marvin Charles Cummings (Coalhouse Walker, Jr.), Kristin Rinde (Mother), Christian Ranke (Tateh), Kristian Grønvold (Younger Brother), Lars Arne Rinde (Father), Marianne Snekkestad/Cecilie Due (Emma Goldman) and Trine Eide Schjølberg/Ida Rinde Sunde (Evelyn Nesbit). It was translated by Christian Ranke and Cecilie Due.

The scene design was inspired by the suitcases on display at the Ellis Island immigrant museum. The production used a scaled down version of William D. Brohn's original orchestrations.

===Revivals===

==== 2009 Broadway revival ====

A new production opened at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]], Washington, DC, on April 18, 2009, and ran through May 17, 2009, with direction and choreography by [[Marcia Milgrom Dodge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showevent&amp;event=TJTSF "Ragtime"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613143957/http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showevent&amp;event=TJTSF |date=2011-06-13 }}, kennedy-center.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/130149-Kennedy_Center_Ragtime_Is_Aiming_for_Broadway 3F "Kennedy Center ''Ragtime'' Is Aiming for Broadway"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614080446/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/130149-Kennedy_Center_Ragtime_Is_Aiming_for_Broadway |date=2009-06-14 }} playbill.com&lt;/ref&gt;
The production then moved to Broadway at the [[Neil Simon Theatre]], with previews beginning on October 23, 2009 and the show officially opened on November 15, 2009. The cast featured Stephanie Umoh (Sarah), [[Quentin Earl Darrington]] (Coalhouse Walker, Jr.), [[Christiane Noll]] (Mother), [[Robert Petkoff]] (Tateh), [[Bobby Steggert]] (Younger Brother), Donna Migliaccio (Emma Goldman) and [[Ron Bohmer]] (Father).  This was the first Broadway revival of the musical and the first Broadway revival of any 1990s musical. The production opened to critical acclaim but closed on January 10, 2010 after 28 previews and 65 performances. This production had a large cast and orchestra, resulting in a significant weekly running cost that demanded the show be a popular success in order to prove financially worthwhile. "There had been rumors in recent weeks that the show would not be able to survive into early 2010; there was apparently not enough of an advance sale to encourage the producers." &lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.[https://archive.is/20120917175206/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/135790 "Say Goodbye to Music: The Era of Ragtime Ends Jan. 10"] playbill.com, January 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the closing, the production received seven Tony Award nominations, including Best Revival of Musical, Best Direction, Best Actress in Musical, and Best Featured Actor in a Musical.

==Synopsis==
'''Act One'''

The musical introduces the American experience at the turn of the 20th century through the eyes of three different facets of society, in the New York City area.  The first is an upper-class white family from [[New Rochelle]]—Mother, Father, Mother's Younger Brother, Grandfather, and the Little Boy, Edgar. Theirs is a genteel, sheltered atmosphere, far from the bustle of [[Harlem]], where the African-American community, including a beautiful young woman named Sarah, explores a new kind of music pioneered by a pianist named Coalhouse Walker Jr.  Meanwhile, immigrants from all parts of the globe set out to seek better lives in the tenements of the [[Lower East Side]], among them Tateh, a Jewish artist from Latvia, and his young daughter. These three disparate worlds are connected only by celebrities: tycoons such as [[J.P. Morgan]] and [[Henry Ford]], activists such as [[Booker T. Washington]] and [[Emma Goldman]], and entertainers such as [[Harry Houdini]] and [[Evelyn Nesbit]], who has been catapulted into fame by the murder of her wealthy lover [[Stanford White]] by her millionaire husband [[Harry K. Thaw]]. As the century dawns, the separate worlds of New York City begin to blur together (“Prologue—Ragtime”).

Mother and her Family say goodbye to Father as he embarks on [[Robert Peary]]'s expedition to the North Pole. He asks Mother to oversee his affairs, her first experience with any kind of independence. He assures her that nothing will change in his absence but Mother, feeling adrift without dreams of her own, hopes differently (“Goodbye, My Love”).  On board Admiral Peary's ship, Father encounters the ship's First Officer, [[Matthew Henson]], and is shocked to find he is a black man. He catches a glimpse of the rag ship carrying Tateh and his Little Girl to America and waves at the immigrants, who he cynically imagines "don't have a chance" in America. Tateh, incredulous anyone would want to leave such a wonderful country as America, returns the hail, while Mother, back on shore, also wishes Father a safe passage  (“Journey On”).

Mother's Younger Brother, an intense, awkward young man, is consistently in search of something fulfilling in life, and his latest obsession is Evelyn Nesbit. He takes a regular seat in the balcony of the vaudeville theatre where Evelyn performs her act, a risqué parody of her husband's murder trial (“Crime of the Century”).  After the show ends, Younger Brother confesses his love to Evelyn.  She kisses him, but only for the benefit of a press photographer, cheerfully rejecting him once he has served his purpose.

Back at the family's home in New Rochelle, Mother discovers a black newborn baby who has been buried alive in her garden.  The police arrive with Sarah, the baby's mother, and on an impulse Mother takes responsibility for both Sarah and her child. She marvels both at her newfound compassion and at the realization that her husband would never have allowed her to make such a decision were he present (“What Kind of Woman”).

At [[Ellis Island]], the immigrants arrive at their new home (“A Shtetl Iz Amereke”). Tateh eagerly begins his new life, drawing silhouettes and selling them from a street corner cart, but he quickly finds the [[American Dream]] not so readily accessible. Emma Goldman attempts to get him to join the Socialist movement, but he is determined to leave politics alone. The Little Girl grows ill and Tateh rapidly becomes destitute. A low point comes when a wealthy stranger offers to buy the Little Girl from him, and he snaps, cursing his new country. Inspired by the success of immigrant magician Harry Houdini, Tateh resolves to sell his cart and begin again somewhere else (“Success”).

The people of Harlem dance to Coalhouse's music (“His Name Was Coalhouse”) and he sings of his lost love, Sarah. Having discovered where she is, Coalhouse embarks on a plan to win back her affections (“Gettin' Ready Rag”), culminating in a visit to Henry Ford's factory for a brand new [[Model T]], and the inventor himself proudly explains his system of automated production (“Henry Ford”).

Back in New Rochelle, Mother and Edgar wait for the trolley to New York City and meet Tateh and the Little Girl, who are heading to Boston. To set an example for her son, who is staring rudely at them, Mother surprises Tateh by engaging him in polite conversation (“Nothing Like the City”). On his way to find Sarah in New Rochelle, Coalhouse encounters a volunteer fire squad, led by chief Will Conklin, who react with hostility to the sight of a black man driving his own car.  Meanwhile, Sarah sings to her son in the attic of their new home (“Your Daddy's Son”), attempting to explain how her heartbreak, fear and despair led her to make such a terrible decision.

Coalhouse arrives at the Family's door on his quest to find and win back Sarah. He is stunned to learn of her child's existence and when she refuses to see him, he resolves to return the following Sunday. This continues for some time (“The Courtship”), and eventually Mother invites him inside for a refreshment. He tells her of his career as a musician and his plans to support his family. Father returns home from the North Pole to find Coalhouse playing ragtime in the Family's parlor. He is stunned by the unexpected and unorthodox changes to his household, and he finds Mother unsympathetic to his complaints. He reflects on how much he has missed and how unsure he is of the world, but Mother and Younger Brother have embraced the changes. Hearing Coalhouse's music, Sarah finally descends to forgive him, and the lovers are joyfully reunited (“New Music”).

Coalhouse takes Sarah on an idyllic picnic, where he tells her of his hopes for the future, inspired by the words of Booker T. Washington. With their son in their arms, the pair sing about the promise this country offers their baby boy (“Wheels of a Dream”).

Emma Goldman speaks passionately in a Worker's Hall, promoting the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike|textile mills strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts]], where mill workers, including Tateh and his daughter, are suffering at the hands of the national militia called in to settle the strike.  Younger Brother takes respite from the cold inside the rally and finds inspiration, imagining Goldman is speaking directly to him (“The Night That Goldman Spoke at Union Square”).  The rally descends into a riot as Goldman is arrested, which mirrors the chaos in Lawrence. Tateh, participating in the strike, is attempting to evacuate his daughter to safety, but he is struck by a policeman and they are separated. At the last moment he leaps on the train to accompany her out of Lawrence. As she sobs, terrified at the violence, Tateh calms her by showing her his newest invention: a [[flip book]] of moving silhouettes. The conductor of the train they are on offers to buy the book and Tateh, hurriedly dubbing it a "moviebook", sells it to him for a dollar. Recognizing that he has a product people will buy, Tateh celebrates his first chance at real success and resolves never to look back (“Gliding”).

Returning home from their picnic, Coalhouse and Sarah are stopped by Will Conklin and his volunteer fire squad.  Conklin demands a toll be paid in exchange for passage but Coalhouse will not yield to the injustice. As Booker T. Washington gives a lecture advocating patience and dignity in the black community, the firemen destroy the Model T and roll it into a lake (“The Trashing of the Car”).  Incensed, Coalhouse seeks justice but the system has none to offer (“Justice”). Furious and determined to keep his dignity, Coalhouse postpones his marriage to Sarah until his car is restored, which prompts her to seek justice on his behalf.  She hears of a campaign rally in New Rochelle and goes in the hopes that the vice-presidential candidate will be able to help (“President”).  However, she is mistaken for a would-be assassin by JP Morgan and beaten to death by the Secret Service.  At her funeral, grief and anger overtake her mourners, who alternatively demand an end to such injustice and pray for the day when all people will have justice and equality. As Mother, Father, Tateh and Emma Goldman look on, Coalhouse collapses by Sarah's grave (“Till We Reach That Day”).

'''Act Two'''

In a dream sequence, The Little Boy watches Harry Houdini perform a daring escape act in which he is locked in a dynamite-laden box by Will Conklin. The box explodes, and although Houdini emerges smiling from the audience, the little boy wakes up screaming from his nightmare ("Harry Houdini, Master Escapist").  He yells for his mother, proclaiming that something bad is going to happen. He is proved correct when a volunteer firehouse is bombed and several firemen are killed.

After Sarah's death, Coalhouse vows to get justice on his own terms (“Coalhouse's Soliloquy”).  He terrorizes New Rochelle, killing several firemen and bombing a volunteer firehouse while posting demands that his car be restored and returned to him, and that Will Conklin be delivered into his hands. Booker T. Washington condemns Coalhouse's actions but many angry young men are drawn to his cause (“Coalhouse Demands”). The family stands at the center of the scandal as Mother retains custody of Sarah and Coalhouse's baby. Father blames her for bringing this turmoil into their lives, but Younger Brother furiously lambasts him for his blindness. He storms out of the house.  Mother is becoming increasingly irritated by Father's actions, and encourages him to explain to their son what is happening. Instead, Father invites Edgar to a baseball game, an act that earns him his wife's open scorn. He expects it to be the genteel, respectful game he played in college, and is horrified to find himself in the middle of a rowdy crowd of immigrants and drunks (“What a Game”).

Father's attempt at distraction is not enough to keep at bay the effects of Coalhouse's demands and acts of violence (“Fire in the City”). As the outside world bears down on the family, Father decides to move them all to Atlantic City where there is the promise of an escape from the worries of New York (“Atlantic City”).  Upon their arrival, the family encounter a film crew taking shots of the boardwalk, directed by none other than Tateh, who has re-invented himself as "the Baron Ashkenazy", a pioneering director and producer of moving pictures (“Buffalo Nickel Photoplay, Inc.”). Also present in Atlantic City are Evelyn Nesbit, whose career is now in a downward spiral, and Harry Houdini, who is recovering from the loss of his beloved mother by delving into the supernatural. When he encounters Edgar on the street, the young boy urges Houdini to "warn the Duke" before running off.   Edgar and the Little Girl soon become fast friends, prompting the growth of a friendship between Mother and Tateh.  Together they marvel in how simple and profound children's lives are, and he confesses to her his humble origins, an act of trust that touches her greatly (“Our Children”).

Back in Harlem, Younger Brother seeks out Coalhouse but is repeatedly turned away until Coalhouse is convinced that he can be trusted.  As one of Coalhouse's men leads Younger Brother to the Gang's hideout, Coalhouse, who has banished music from his life, watches a carefree young couple ("Harlem Nightclub") and remembers his first encounter with Sarah (“Sarah Brown Eyes”). Once Younger Brother arrives, he is unable to articulate why he wants to join the fight. The men's profound thoughts are narrated by Emma Goldman, but instead he merely tells Coalhouse "I know how to blow things up." (“He Wanted to Say”).

Coalhouse and his men, including Younger Brother, take over J.P. Morgan's magnificent library in the heart of New York City and threaten to blow it up. Father informs Mother that he's been summoned to New York to help reason with Coalhouse. Before he goes, he assures her that everything will soon return to the way it was, but Mother has changed too much to allow that to happen (“Back to Before”).  Upon his arrival at the tense police encampment around the library, Father suggests that Coalhouse may listen to Booker T. Washington. Coalhouse allows Washington to enter the library but remains unreachable until Washington mentions the legacy Coalhouse is leaving his son.  Coalhouse and Washington work out a deal for peaceful surrender but Younger Brother is enraged by Coalhouse's abandonment of their cause (“Look What You've Done”).

Washington leaves and Father enters the library as a hostage. The change in his life that he has been so forcefully trying to ignore finally manages to squeeze into his heart as Coalhouse convinces Younger Brother and his men that violence will not solve injustice.  Coalhouse charges them all to change society through the power of their words and by telling their children their story (“Make Them Hear You”).  Profoundly affected by their leader's sacrifice, Younger Brother and the Gang leave the Morgan Library peacefully while Father tells Coalhouse about his son.  Coalhouse thanks Father for his kindness and, as he leaves the library, is shot and killed by the police.

Edgar takes on the task of fulfilling Coalhouse's wishes that their story be told. The company returns to tell us the conclusion of each of their own stories: Younger Brother departs for Mexico to fight alongside [[Emiliano Zapata]]. Emma Goldman is arrested and deported. Booker T. Washington establishes the [[Tuskegee Institute]], while Evelyn Nesbitt fades into obscurity. Harry Houdini realizes upon the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] that Edgar's warning was the one truly mystical experience of his life. Father is killed when the [[RMS Lusitania]] is sunk, and after a year of mourning, Mother marries Tateh. They adopt Coalhouse and Sarah's son, naming him Coalhouse Walker III, and move to California. Watching his children play, Tateh is struck by an idea for a [[Our Gang|film series]] centering on a group of children of different races and classes banding together. The Era of Ragtime may be over, but as the united family is watched by the spirits of Coalhouse and Sarah, America continues to assimilate and flourish (“Epilogue: Ragtime/Wheels of a Dream: Reprise”).

The '''Rebellion of mayor Albert''' ({{lang-pl|bunt wójta Alberta}}) was an uprising by the burghers of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Polish]] city of [[Kraków]] against the duke [[Władysław I the Elbow-high]] in the years 1311–12.&lt;ref name="Abulafia1995"&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book|author=David Abulafia|title=The New Cambridge Medieval History: c. 1198-c. 1300|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bclfdU_2lesC&amp;pg=PA775|accessdate=22 May 2011|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-36289-4|page=775}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mutiny was led by Albert, the [[vogt]] ({{lang-la|advocatus}}, {{lang-pl|wójt}}) who was effectively a [[mayor]] of the town under [[Magdeburg Law]].&lt;ref name="Rădvan2010"/&gt; It ended with the duke (later king) Władysław's victory. 

==Background==
After Kraków had been devastated during the 1241 [[First Mongol invasion of Poland|Mongol invasion of Poland]], it was re-established according to [[Magdeburg rights|Magdeburg Law]] by Prince [[Bolesław V the Chaste]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan Hahn, ''Ilustrowana historia Śląska w zarysie'', Narodowa Oficyna Śląska, Zabrze 2012, {{ISBN|978-83-60540-26-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1291 the [[Seniorate Province|Duchy of Kraków]] fell to the [[Přemyslid dynasty|Přemyslid]] king [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]] who in 1300 also became King of Poland. Upon the extinction of the Přemyslids in 1306, the [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] duke [[Władysław I the Elbow-high]] assumed the rule at Kraków, while in 1310 the Bohemian Kingdom passed to the [[House of Luxembourg]]. The new king, [[John of Bohemia]], continued to claim the Polish royal title and moreover sought to vassalize the [[Silesian Piasts|Piast]] dukes of the adjacent [[Silesia]]n region.

==Rebellion==
In 1311 [[wójt]] Albert (?-1317), mayor of Kraków (1290-1312), instigated a mutiny against Prince Władysław, with the goal of turning the city &amp;ndash; then the capital of the Polish [[Seniorate Province]] &amp;ndash; over to the Bohemian [[House of Luxembourg]].&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book|author=Jerzy Jan Lerski|title=Historical dictionary of Poland, 966-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QTUTqE2difgC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=22 May 2011|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-26007-0|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert, himself of German&lt;ref name="Rădvan2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurențiu Rădvan|title=At Europe's Borders: Medieval Towns in the Romanian Principalities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0xNYmFwyCdkC&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=22 May 2011|year=2010|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-18010-9|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Czech&lt;ref name="EncyklopediaKirchen-Lexikon1876"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Encyklopedia|author2=Kirchen-Lexikon|title=Encyklopedja Kościelna podług teologicznej encyklopedji [Kirchen-lexikon] Wetzera i Weltego, wydana przez M. Nowodworskiego|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCEAAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA466|accessdate=22 May 2011|year=1876|page=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; origin, had the support of some of the city's German burghers.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt; He also had the support of Bishop [[Jan Muskata]], himself of German-Silesian origin, and the Silesian duke [[Bolko I of Opole]], as well as of many Kraków citizens. After Władysław laid siege to the city, the revolt ended in failure.&lt;ref name="Rădvan2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt; Similar rebellions took place in several other cities, particularly [[Sandomierz]] and [[Wieliczka]]; these were also crushed by Władysław.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

==Aftermath==
Albert fled to [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]]&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt; and his house was demolished, while the Polish [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] Archbishop [[Jakub Świnka]] of [[Gniezno]] charged Bishop Muskata with being "an enemy of the Polish people". In the aftermath the city of Kraków lost many of its privileges due to the support some of its burghers gave to the uprising. From Prince Władysław's point of view the revolt had been motivated by anti-Polish sentiment and the German citizens proved disloyal. He reacted with brutality, culminating in the implementation of the [[shibboleth]] ''Soczewica, koło, miele, młyn'' ("Lentil, wheel, grinds (verb), mill) to distinguish the German-speaking minority of Kraków. 

The uprising was chronicled in a contemporary [[Latin language|Latin]] poem ''De quodam advocate Cracoviensi Alberto'' ("About a Certain Reeve Albert of Kraków") written by an anonymous author.

===Background===
Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican ''[[Lucha Libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]], [[wrestling promotion|company]] [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] has held a [[Rey de Reyes]] (Spanish for "King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February,&lt;ref name="Rey1997"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#1997 | title = Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Rey de Reyes | accessdate = February 19, 2009 | date=February 21, 1997 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the [[eponym]]ious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's ''Rey''.&lt;ref name=YIR1997&gt;{{cite news|title=1997 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2332|date=January 7, 1998|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004&gt;{{cite news|title=Número Especial - Lo mejor de la lucha libre mexicana durante el 2004|work=SuperLuchas|id=Issue 91|date=January 24, 2005|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Four-man elimination match]] with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules.&lt;ref name="Rey1997"/&gt; There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004/&gt; The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the [[AAA Mega Championship]]. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual ''[[AAA Reina de Reinas Championship|Reina de Reinas]]'' ("Queen of Queens") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept.&lt;ref name=Reinas1999&gt;{{Cite book | author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter= Mexico: AAA Reina de Reinas | page= 400 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas12&gt;{{cite news | author = SuperLuchas staff | title = Lo Mejor de la Lucha Libre Mexicana 2008 | work =SuperLuchas | id = issue 296 | date =  January 6, 2008 | url=http://superluchas.net/?p=11145 | accessdate =  July 11, 2009| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas13&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2009/09/26/aaa-heroes-inmortales-homenaje-a-antonio-pena-resultados-en-vivo-26-septiembre-2009-%C2%BFque-pasara-con-la-lucha-entre-charly-manson-y-chessman-%C2%BFquien-sera-el-luchador-sorpresa/ | title= AAA- Héroes Inmortales III- (Resultados en vivo 26 septiembre 2009) – Cibernético gana el Trofeo Antonio Peña – Electroshock sustituye a Charly Manson contra Chessman – El luchador sorpresa fue Konan Big | author= Marquina, Alva | date= September 26, 2009 | accessdate= September 27, 2009 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 show was the 13th Rey de Reyes show in the series.

===Storylines===
The Rey de Reyes show featured nine [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

The full list of participants in the "Rey de Reyes" tournament was announced over a couple of weeks leading up to the show. With 16 names it followed the traditional tournament format of qualifying rounds early in the evening and a 4-way elimination match as the final. the full announced list of participants announced were: [[Silver King (wrestler)|Silver King]], [[Alan Stone (wrestler)|Alan Stone]], [[Octagón]], [[Super Fly (wrestler)|Super Fly]], [[Black Abyss]], [[Escoria]], [[Abismo Negro]], [[Electroshock (wrestler)|Electroshock]], [[Joe Lider]], [[Dark Ozz]], [[Latin Lover (wrestler)|Latin Lover]], [[Psicosis|Nicho "El Millonario"]], [[El Elegido]], [[La Parka II|La Parka]], [[Psycho Clown]], and [[Brazo de Plata|Super Porky]].&lt;ref name=" Rey2009Entrants1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rey2009EntrantsFull"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rey2009Entrants2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wrestleview.com/news2009/1234504538.php | title = Viva La Raza! #Trece Lucha Weekly| accessdate = 2009-02-19| publisher = WrestleView.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group one: Abismon Negro, Latin Lover, Dark Ozz and Black Abyss.&lt;ref name="Rey2009Card"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://superluchas.net/?p=17176 | title = El cartel de Rey de Reyes 2009 de AAA | accessdate = 2009-02-27| date = 2009-02-26 | publisher = SuperLucha.net | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group two: El Elegido, Alan Stone, Silver King and Joe Lider.&lt;ref name="Rey2009Card"/&gt; Group three: Octagón, Super Fly, Electroshock and Nicho "El Millonario".&lt;ref name="Rey2009Card"/&gt; Group four: La Parka, Super Porky, Dark Escoria and Psycho Clown.&lt;ref name="Rey2009Card"/&gt; In the days leading up to the event it was announced that Psycho Clown had been replaced by [[Kenzo Suzuki]] without any explanation.&lt;ref name="Ovaciones21527"&gt;{{cite news | author = José Miguel Pérez | title = Rey de Reyes AAA | url = http://itecor.v1.myvirtualpaper.com/15032009/2009031501/en/ | work =Ovaciones | publisher = Editorial Ovaciones, S.

Another match scheduled for the show was a match where [[Konnan]] would face off against a wrestler of Joaquin Roldan's choosing with the special ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'' ("Bet fight") wager being the hair of Joaquin Roldan against the hair of Konnan's associate Arturo Rivera.&lt;ref name="ReyDeHair"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://superluchas.net/?p=16315 | title = Arturo Rivera reta al Lic. Joaquín Roldan, WrestleMania 23 redux | accessdate = 2009-02-26 | date = 2009-02-19 | publisher = SuperLucha.net | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; This match is a result of the very long running storyline between the AAA loyalists and Konnan's [[Foreign Legion (wrestling)|La Legión Extranjera]] (Foreign Legion).&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The storyline between the factions has been the main focus of the AAA promotion for over two years.&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2008 [[Antonio Peña Memorial Show (2008)|Antonio Peña Memorial show]] the storyline saw Konnan win the ownership of AAA from the Roldan family.&lt;ref name=Cup2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/misccards.html#pena2007|title=AAA Misc. Cards – Pena Memorial show 2008|accessdate=2009-02-13|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since winning the ownership several vignettes were aired showing Konnan and La Legión taking over the offices of AAA, further promoting the storyline that Konnan really was in charge of the federation.&lt;ref name="KonnanTakeOver"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://superluchas.net/?p=8772 | title = El 15 de noviembre inicia la era de Konnan al frente de AAA | accessdate = 2009-02-26 | date = 2008-11-08 | publisher = SuperLucha.net | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of 2009 rumors of embesselment began to spread after AAA commentator wrote an article in the newspaper "Recórd" where he stated that former AAA owner Joaquin Rolando and AAA Chief Financial Officer Marisela Peña had requested that an American accountant firm audit the books of AAA.&lt;ref name="Audit"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://superluchas.net/?p=13241 | title = El Dr. Morales en el ángulo del desfalco de AAA | accessdate = 2009-02-26 | date = 2009-01-23 | publisher = SuperLucha.net | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upset with the allegations ''La Legión'' loyalist Arturo Rivera, AAA's other commentator, defended Konnan on air leading to Joaquin Roldano returning to the spotlight for the first time after losing control of the company in November, 2008. During Roldano's in-ring promo Arturo Rivera interrupted him and attacked him. After the two were pulled apart Rivera challenged Roldano to a hair vs. hair match where each picked a wrestler to represent themselves.&lt;ref name="Rey2009EntrantsFull"/&gt; Rivera picked Konnan to represent him.&lt;ref name="ReyDeHair"/&gt; On February 26 it was announced that Joaquin Roldano had chosen AAA Commissioner [[Vampiro|Vampiro Canadienese]] to represent him in the match.&lt;ref name="Rey2009Card"/&gt;

The next featured contest was a [[AAA Mega Championship]] match between champion [[El Mesias]] and challenger [[Chessman (wrestler)|Chessman]]. The scripted feud started during a television taping where Chessman and El Mesias faced off in a wrestling match, the match got so out of hand that Chessman ended up being thrown over the side of the balcony and through a stack of tables. The show went to commercial with Chessman looking seriously injured as he received medical treatment.&lt;ref name="Rey2009Entrants2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FallMexico"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://superluchas.net/?p=16067 | title = AAA: Superplancha de AeroStar - Reaparece Charly Manson - Vampiro podría volver a luchar - Chessman al fin vence a El Mesías | accessdate = 2009-02-23 | publisher = SuperLucha.net | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week another singles match between the two was scheduled but Chessman came out on crutches wearing a neck brace. Just as El Mesias though Chessman was going to announce that he was too injured to wrestle Chessman attacked him with a crutch revealing that the injury was nothing but a ruse to give Chessman an advantage as he quickly pinned the champion in their non-title match.&lt;ref name="Raza14"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wrestleview.com/news2009/1235108240.php | title = Viva La Raza! #Catorce: Lucha Weekly | accessdate = 2009-02-23 | publisher = WrestleView }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the final television taping before Rey de Reyes AAA "owner" Konnan changed a match that was supposed to see El Mesias team with Vampiro to take on Chessman and Konnan to a handicap match, stating that Vampiro was not allowed to wrestle that night and turned the match into a handicap match. After Chessman and Konnan won the match the rest of ''La Legión'' came to the ring to beat down El Mesias, teasing that Chessman may have joined La Legión Extranjera but not confirming it.&lt;ref name="LastAAAShow"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thecubsfan.com/cmll/?p=4700 | title = 03/04 AAA TV Results (SLP) | accessdate = 2009-03-06 | date = 2009-03-05 | publisher = TheCubsFan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another non-tournament match on the card was originally billed as "Radical Hell Brothers" and was supposed to feature [[Charly Manson]] and [[El Zorro (wrestler)|El Zorro]] facing off in a tag team partner where each wrestler had a "Surprise partner" that would not be announced until the time of the match. Charly Manson recently returned from an injury that forced him to sit out for 10 months and immediately came to the rescue of the AAA fan favorites when ''La Legión Extranjera'' attacked them.&lt;ref name="Return"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://superluchas.net/?p=16067 | title = AAA: Superplancha de AeroStar - Reaparece Charly Manson - Vampiro podría volver a luchar - Chessman al fin vence a El Mesías | accessdate = 2009-02-23 | date = 2009-02-15 |publisher = SuperLuchas.net | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raza15"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wrestleview.com/news2009/1235722716.php | title = Viva La Raza! #Quince: Lucha Weekly | accessdate = 2009-03-02 | publisher = WrestleView }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later at another television taping Manson made his in ring return, teaming with Latin Lover and [[X-Pac]] to defeat Konnan, Electroshock and El Zorro.&lt;ref name="Raza14"/&gt; In the week before the show the booking of this match was changed so that instead of featuring surprise partners Charly Manson would team up with D-Generation-Mex members X-Pac and [[Alex Koslov]], while El Zorro would team up with [[The Hart Foundation 2.0]] ([[Teddy Hart]] and [[Jack Evans (wrestler)|Jack Evans]]).&lt;ref name="Ovaciones21527"/&gt; It had originally been AAA's intent to have [[Cibernético]] return to the promotion and team up with Manson but when negotiations between the two parts broke down the scheduled match was changed.&lt;ref name="Rey2009News"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wrestleview.com/news2009/1236925821.php | title = Viva La Raza! #Diecisiete Lucha Weekly| accessdate = 2009-03-15| publisher = wrestleview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rock al Parque''' is a rock music festival which, since 1995, has taken place in [[Bogotá|Bogotá, Colombia]]. Entry to the festival is free of charge. In 2004, 400,000 people took part in the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockalparque.gov.co/historia.php Rock al Parque] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707053130/http://www.rockalparque.gov.co/historia.php |date=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered the largest rock festival in Colombia and one of the most important in Latin America, arguably the largest free rock festival in the continent{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}. It has ska, punk, hardcore, metal, and other genres included in its program.

==History==
[[File:Rock2008kronos.jpg|thumb|Rock al Parque 2008]]
The first edition of this festival happened in 1995. It started as a continuation of the 'Youth Music meetings' held at the city's Planetarium in 1992. The people behind the organization were Mario Duarte and Julio Correal. The initial purpose was to gain the support of Bogota's Institute of Culture and Tourism, to establish it. The first edition of this festival happened during May 26 and 29, 1995, within several venues. To mention them, the most representative one known as 'La Media Torta', The [[Simón Bolívar Park]], the 'Olaya Herrera's Stadium, and 'the Santa María Bullfighting' Ring. This last one was the only venue requesting admission fees for participants. Therefore, after 1996, the festival organisers decided to exclude this last venue, "the Santa María Bullfighting Ring", in order to feature the festival "free of charge for admission" since.

The festival, which originally only included rock music, gradually opened up its doors to promote other genres, such as punk, reggae, ska and blues musicians. Due to the increase in diversity, the festival's organizers started scheduling bands so that different types of musicians could participate alongside one another, as opposed to grouping acts by genre.

Nowadays the festival takes place over three days at [[Bogotá]]'s [[Simon Bolivar Park]]. The festival is broadcast live over [[Canal Capital]], a local public television channel, and [[Radiónica]], a public radio network.

The sale of alcohol at Rock al Parque is prohibited, as is smoking, despite the fact that the event takes place outdoors. Concertgoers are not allowed entry if they are wearing belts with metallic buckles, as these can be used as weapons. Furthermore, all concertgoers have to go through a routine security inspection before entering the concert grounds, and may even be asked to remove their shoes and socks if need be. Concerts are scheduled between 1:00 and 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.

==Participants==
The festival features national and international bands of different genres. After 1997, artists were selected by a jury after an open multi-stage process (pre-selection, presentation and live auditions). As an incentive, the chosen bands win prizes, as well as the opportunity to share the stage with international bands. Sometimes, acts are invited by the organizing committee directly. Up to year 2009 there have been 473 artists and 3,092,000 people. The third edition of the festival in 1997, had the largest number of participants, with 87 bands. On the other hand, the eighth edition, in 2002, had the fewest, with only 25. On average, 51.6 bands have performed annually at 'Rock al Parque'. The 2004 edition, which marked the festival's 10th anniversary, had over 400,000 spectators.

'''Saint Patrick's Day''', or the '''Feast of Saint Patrick''' ({{lang-ga|Lá Fhéile Pádraig}}, "the Day of the Festival of Patrick"), is a cultural and religious celebration held on 17 March, the traditional death date of [[Saint Patrick]] ({{circa}}&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;385–461), the foremost [[patron saint]] of [[Ireland]].

Saint Patrick's Day was made an official Christian [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] in the early 17th century and is observed by the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Communion]] (especially the [[Church of Ireland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ireland.anglican.org/index.php?do=news&amp;newsid=3496 |title=St Patrick's Day celebrations |website=Church of Ireland |publisher=The Irish Times |via=ireland.anglican.org |date=12 March 2011 |accessdate=17 March 2013 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515055936/http://www.ireland.anglican.org/index.php?do=news&amp;newsid=3496 |archive-date=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]].

Saint Patrick's Day is celebrated in more countries than any other [[National Day|national festival]].{{sfnp|Cronin|Adair|2002 |p=242|ps=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5TYHqrao2PwC&amp;pg=SL26-PA42]}} Modern celebrations have been greatly influenced by those of the Irish diaspora, particularly those that developed in North America. In recent years{{when|date=July 2018}}, there has been criticism of Saint Patrick's Day celebrations for having become too commercialised and for fostering negative stereotypes of the Irish people.

==Saint Patrick==
{{Main|Saint Patrick}}

Patrick was a 5th-century Romano-British Christian missionary and bishop in Ireland. Much of what is known about Saint Patrick comes from the ''Declaration'', which was allegedly written by Patrick himself. It is believed that he was born in [[Roman Britain]] in the fourth century, into a wealthy [[Romano-British]] family. His father was a [[deacon]] and his grandfather was a priest in the Christian church. According to the ''Declaration'', at the age of sixteen, he was kidnapped by Irish raiders and taken as a slave to [[Gaelic Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/patrick/confession.ii.html |title=Confession of St. Patrick |publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library at Calvin College |accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It says that he spent six years there working as a shepherd and that during this time he "found God". The ''Declaration'' says that God told Patrick to flee to the coast, where a ship would be waiting to take him home. After making his way home, Patrick went on to become a priest.

According to tradition, Patrick returned to Ireland to convert the [[Celtic polytheism|pagan]] Irish to Christianity. The ''Declaration'' says that he spent many years evangelising in the northern half of Ireland and converted "thousands". Patrick's efforts against the [[druid]]s were eventually turned into an allegory in which he drove "snakes" out of Ireland (Ireland never had any snakes).

Tradition holds that he died on 17 March and was buried at [[Downpatrick]]. Over the following centuries, many legends grew up around Patrick and he became Ireland's foremost saint.

==Celebration and traditions==

[[File:Irish clover.jpg|thumb|upright|According to legend, Saint Patrick used the three-leaved [[shamrock]] to explain the [[Holy Trinity]] to Irish pagans.]]

Today's St Patrick's Day celebrations have been greatly influenced by those that developed among the Irish diaspora, especially in North America. Until the late 20th century, St Patrick's Day was often a bigger celebration among the diaspora than it was in Ireland.{{sfnp|Cronin|Adair|2002 |p=242|ps=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5TYHqrao2PwC&amp;pg=SL26-PA42]}}

Celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals, Irish traditional music sessions ([[céilidh|céilithe]]), and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks.&lt;ref name="Irish Culture 2"/&gt; There are also formal gatherings such as banquets and dances, although these were more common in the past. St Patrick's Day parades began in North America in the 18th century but did not spread to Ireland until the 20th century.{{sfnp|Cronin|Adair|2002 |p=xxiii}} The participants generally include marching bands, the military, fire brigades, cultural organisations, charitable organisations, [[voluntary association]]s, [[Youth organization|youth groups]], [[Fraternity|fraternities]], and so on. However, over time, many of the parades have become more akin to a [[carnival]]. More effort is made to use the [[Irish language]], especially in Ireland, where the week of St Patrick's Day is "[[Seachtain na Gaeilge|Irish language week]]". Recently{{when|date=July 2018}}, famous landmarks have been lit up in green on St Patrick's Day.

Christians may also attend [[church service]]s,&lt;ref name="Irish Culture 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Culture 5"/&gt; and the [[Lenten]] restrictions [[Christian fasting|on eating]] and [[Christianity and alcohol|drinking alcohol]] are lifted for the day. Perhaps because of this, drinking alcohol – particularly Irish whiskey, beer, or cider – has become an integral part of the celebrations.&lt;ref name="Irish Culture 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Culture 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Culture 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Culture 4"/&gt; The St Patrick's Day custom of "drowning the shamrock" or "wetting the shamrock" was historically popular, especially in Ireland. At the end of the celebrations, a shamrock is put into the bottom of a cup, which is then filled with whiskey, beer, or cider. It is then drunk as a [[Toast (honor)|toast]] to St Patrick, Ireland, or those present. The shamrock would either be swallowed with the drink or taken out and tossed over the shoulder for good luck.{{sfnp|Cronin|Adair|2002 |p=26}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Santino|first=Jack|title=All Around the Year: Holidays and Celebrations in American Life |year=1995|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Donal Hickey |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/outdoors/donal-hickey/the-facts-about-shamrock-262195.html |title=The facts about shamrock |work=[[Irish Examiner]] |date=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wearing green===
[[File:Totally Irish in London.jpg|thumb|upright|Girls wearing green in London]]
On St Patrick's Day, it is customary to wear [[shamrock]]s, green clothing or green accessories. St Patrick is said to have used the shamrock, a three-leaved plant, to explain the [[Holy Trinity]] to the [[Celtic polytheism|pagan Irish]].&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jennifer |last=Vernon |date=15 March 2004 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/03/0312_040312_stpatrick_2.html |title=St. Patrick's Day: Fact vs. Fiction |website=National Geographic News |page=2 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jill |last=Newell |url= http://www.csulb.edu/~d49er/spring00/news/v7n91-holiday.html |title=Holiday has history|work=Daily Forty-Niner|date=16 March 2000 |volume=7 |issue=91 |accessdate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story first appears in writing in 1726, though it may be older. In pagan Ireland, three was a significant number and the Irish had many [[triple deity|triple deities]], a fact that may have aided St Patrick in his [[evangelism|evangelisation]] efforts.&lt;ref name="Monaghan2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Monaghan|first=Patricia|title=The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-1-438-11037-0 |quote=There is no evidence that the clover or wood sorrel (both of which are called shamrocks) were sacred to the Celts in any way. However, the Celts had a philosophical and cosmological vision of triplicity, with many of their divinities appearing in three. Thus when St. Patrick, attempting to convert the Druids on Beltane, held up a shamrock and discoursed on the Christian Trinity, the three-in-one god, he was doing more than finding a homely symbol for a complex religious concept. He was indicating knowledge of the significance of three in the Celtic realm, a knowledge that probably made his mission far easier and more successful than if he had been unaware of that number's meaning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hegarty2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hegarty|first=Neil|title=Story of Ireland|date=24 April 2012|publisher=Ebury Publishing |isbn=978-1-448-14039-8 |quote=In some ways, though, the Christian mission resonated: pre-Christian devotion was characterized by, for example, the worship of gods in groups of three, by sayings collected in threes (triads), and so on – from all of which the concept of the Holy Trinity was not so very far removed. Against this backdrop the myth of Patrick and his three-leafed shamrock fits quite neatly.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patricia Monaghan]] says there is no evidence that the shamrock was sacred to the pagan Irish.&lt;ref name="Monaghan2009" /&gt; However, [[Jack Santino]] speculates that it may have represented the regenerative powers of nature, and was recast in a Christian context{{nsmdns}}[[icon]]s of St Patrick often depict the saint "with a [[Christian cross|cross]] in one hand and a sprig of shamrocks in the other".&lt;ref name="Santino1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Santino|first=Jack|title=All Around the Year: Holidays and Celebrations in American Life|year=1995|publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=978-0-252-06516-3 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Homan writes, "We can perhaps see St Patrick drawing upon the visual concept of the ''[[Triple spiral|triskele]]'' when he uses the shamrock to explain the Trinity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Homan|first=Roger|title=The Art of the Sublime: Principles of Christian Art and Architecture|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first association of the colour green with Ireland is from the 11th century pseudo-historical book [[Lebor Gabála Érenn]] (The Book of the Taking of Ireland), which forms part of the [[Mythological Cycle]] in [[Irish Mythology]] and describes the story of [[Goídel Glas]] who is credited as the [[eponymous ancestor]] of the [[Gaels]] and creator of the [[Goidelic languages]] ([[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Manx language|Manx]]).&lt;ref name=Koch2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=MacKillop2005/&gt; In the story Goídel Glas, who was the son of [[Scota]] and Niul, was bitten by a snake and was saved from death by [[Moses]] placing his staff on the snakebite. As a reminder of the incident he would retain a green mark that would stay with him and he would lead his people to a land that would be free of snakes.&lt;ref name=Macalister1939/&gt; This is emphasized in his name Goídel which was anglicised to the word Gaelic and Glas which is the Irish word for green.&lt;ref name=Koch2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=MacKillop2005/&gt; Another story from the [[Lebor Gabála Érenn]] written after the adventures of [[Goídel Glas]] refers to [[Milesians (Irish)#Myth|Íth]] climbing the tower (in reference to the  [[Tower of Hercules]]) his father [[Breogán]] builds in Brigantia (modern day [[A Coruña|Corunna]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Spain]]) on a winters day and is so captivated by the sight of a beautiful green island in the distance that he must set sail immediately. This story also introduces three national personifications of Ireland, [[Banba]], [[Fódla]] and [[Ériu]].&lt;ref name=Koch2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=MacKillop2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macalister1939/&gt; The colour green was further associated with Ireland from the 1640s, when the [[Flag and coat of arms of Leinster|green harp flag]] was used by the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Catholic Confederation]]. Green ribbons and shamrocks have been worn on St Patrick's Day since at least the 1680s.{{sfnp|Cronin|Adair|2002}} The Friendly Brothers of St Patrick, an Irish [[fraternity]] founded in about 1750,&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, James. ''That Damn'd Thing Called Honour: Duelling in Ireland, 1570–1860''. Cork University Press, 1995. p.65&lt;/ref&gt; adopted green as its colour.&lt;ref&gt;''The Fundamental Laws, Statutes and Constitutions of the Ancient Order of the Friendly Brothers of Saint Patrick''. 1751.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the [[Order of St. Patrick]]—an Anglo-Irish [[chivalric order]]—was founded in 1783 it adopted blue as its colour, which led to blue [[St. Patrick's blue|being associated with St Patrick]]. During the 1790s, green would become associated with [[Irish nationalism]], due to its use by the [[United Irishmen]]. This was a [[Irish republicanism|republican]] organisation—led mostly by Protestants but with many Catholic members—who launched a [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion in 1798]] against British rule. The phrase "wearing of the green" comes from a [[The Wearing of the Green|song of the same name]], which laments United Irishmen supporters being persecuted for wearing green. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have seen the re-emergence of Irish cultural symbols, such as the [[Irish Language]], [[Irish mythology]], and the colour green, through the [[Gaelic Revival]] and the [[Irish Literary Revival]] which served to stir Irish nationalist sentiment. The influence of green was more prominently observable in the [[List of flags of Ireland#Political flags|flags]] of the 1916 Easter Rising such as the [[Sunburst flag|Sunburst Flag]], the [[Starry Plough (flag)|Starry Plough Banner]], and the [[Irish Republic|Proclamation Flag of the Irish Republic]] which was flown over the [[General Post Office, Dublin]] together with the [[Flag of Ireland|Irish Tricolour]]. Throughout these centuries, the colour green and its association with St Patrick's Day grew.&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{Cite video |url=http://www.history.com/topics/st-patricks-day/videos#green |title=St. Patrick: Why Green? – video |publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks |website=History.com |accessdate=17 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307170353/http://www.history.com/topics/st-patricks-day/videos |archivedate=7 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wearing of the 'St Patrick's Day Cross' was also a popular custom in Ireland until the early 20th century. These were a [[Celtic cross|Celtic Christian cross]] made of paper that was "covered with silk or ribbon of different colours, and a bunch or rosette of green silk in the centre".{{sfnp|Cronin|Adair|2002 |pp=25–26|ps=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5TYHqrao2PwC&amp;pg=PA25]}}

===Ireland===
[[File:St. Patricks Day Parade (2013) In Dublin Was Excellent But The Weather And The Turnout Was Disappointing (8566201364).jpg|thumb|A St Patrick's Day parade in Dublin]]
Saint Patrick's feast day, as a kind of national day, was already being celebrated by the Irish in Europe in the ninth and tenth centuries. In later times, he became more and more widely seen as the patron of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Liam de Paor: ''St. Patrick's World, The Christian Culture of Ireland's Apostolic Age.'' Four Courts Press, Dublin, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Patrick's [[feast day]] was finally placed on the universal [[liturgical calendar]] in the Catholic Church due to the influence of [[Waterford]]-born [[Franciscan]] scholar [[Luke Wadding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''The Catholic Encyclopedia: Luke Wadding''|accessdate=15 February 2007|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15521d.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1600s. Saint Patrick's Day thus became a [[holy day of obligation]] for Roman Catholics in Ireland. It is also a feast day in the [[Church of Ireland]], which is part of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]]. The church calendar avoids the observance of saints' feasts during certain solemnities, moving the saint's day to a time outside those periods. St Patrick's Day is occasionally affected by this requirement, when 17 March falls during [[Holy Week]]. This happened in 1940, when Saint Patrick's Day was observed on 3 April to avoid it coinciding with [[Palm Sunday]], and again in 2008, where it was officially observed on 15 March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/irish_bishops_move_st._patricks_day_2008_over_conflict_with_holy_week/ "Irish bishops move St. Patrick's Day 2008 over conflict with Holy Week"], ''Catholic News''&lt;/ref&gt; St Patrick's Day will not fall within Holy Week again until 2160.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=St. Patrick's Day, Catholic Church march to different drummers|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-03-05-stpatrick_N.htm|work=USA Today | accessdate=11 March 2008 | date=6 March 2008|first=G.

In 1903, St Patrick's Day became an official public holiday in Ireland. This was thanks to the [[Bank Holiday]] (Ireland) Act 1903, an act of the [[United Kingdom Parliament]] introduced by Irish Member of Parliament [[James O'Mara]].&lt;ref name="omara1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humphrysfamilytree.com/OMara/james.html |title=James O'Mara |publisher=HumphrysFamilyTree.com |accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Mara later introduced the law which required that [[public house]]s be shut on 17 March after drinking got out of hand, a provision that was repealed in the 1970s.

The first St Patrick's Day parade in Ireland was held in [[Waterford]] in 1903. The week of St Patrick's Day 1903 had been declared Irish Language Week by the [[Gaelic League]] and in Waterford they opted to have a procession on Sunday 15 March. The procession comprised the Mayor and members of Waterford Corporation, the Trades Hall, the various trade unions and bands who included the 'Barrack St Band' and the '[[Thomas Francis Meagher]] Band'.&lt;ref&gt;Munster Express, 14 March 1903 {{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parade began at the premises of the Gaelic League in George's St and finished in the Peoples Park, where the public were addressed by the Mayor and other dignitaries.&lt;ref name="munster express"&gt;Munster Express, 21 March 1903, p.3{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waterford Chronicle, 18 March 1903{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Tuesday 17 March, most Waterford businesses—including public houses—were closed and marching bands paraded like they had two days previously.&lt;ref&gt;Waterford News, 20 March 1903{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Waterford Trades Hall had been emphatic that the National Holiday be observed.&lt;ref name="munster express" /&gt;

On St Patrick's Day 1916, the [[Irish Volunteers]]—an Irish nationalist paramilitary organisation—held parades throughout Ireland. The authorities recorded 38 St Patrick's Day parades, involving 6,000 marchers, almost half of whom were said to be armed.{{sfnp|Cronin|Adair|2002 |p=105}} The following month, the Irish Volunteers launched the [[Easter Rising]] against British rule. This marked the beginning of the [[Irish revolutionary period]] and led to the [[Irish War of Independence]] and [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]]. During this time, St Patrick's Day celebrations in Ireland were muted, although the day was sometimes chosen to hold large political rallies.{{sfnp|Cronin|Adair|2002 |p=108}} The celebrations remained low-key after the creation of the [[Irish Free State]]; the only state-organized observance was a military procession and [[Trooping the colours|trooping of the colours]], and an Irish-language [[Mass (Catholic Church)|mass]] attended by government ministers.{{sfnp|Cronin|Adair|2002 |p=134}} In 1927, the Irish Free State government [[Prohibition|banned the selling of alcohol]] on St Patrick's Day, although it remained legal in Northern Ireland. The ban was not repealed until 1961.{{sfnp|Cronin|Adair|2002 |pp=135–136}}

The first official, state-sponsored St Patrick's Day parade in [[Dublin]] took place in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Armao, Frederic.

In [[Northern Ireland]], the celebration of St Patrick's Day was affected by sectarian divisions.{{sfnp|Cronin|Adair|2002 |pp=175–177}} A majority of the population were Protestant [[Unionism in Ireland|Ulster unionists]] who saw themselves as British, while a substantial minority were Catholic Irish nationalists who saw themselves as Irish. Although it was a public holiday, Northern Ireland's unionist government did not officially observe St Patrick's Day.{{sfnp|Cronin|Adair|2002 |pp=175–177}} During the conflict known as [[the Troubles]] (late 1960s–late 1990s), public St Patrick's Day celebrations were rare and tended to be associated with the Catholic community.{{sfnp|Cronin|Adair|2002 |pp=175–177}} In 1976, [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] [[Hillcrest Bar bombing|detonated a car bomb]] outside a pub crowded with Catholics celebrating St Patrick's Day in [[Dungannon]]; four civilians were killed and many injured. However, some Protestant unionists attempted to 're-claim' the festival, and in 1985 the [[Orange Order]] held its own St Patrick's Day parade.{{sfnp|Cronin|Adair|2002 |pp=175–177}} Since the end of the conflict in 1998 there have been cross-community St Patrick's Day parades in towns throughout Northern Ireland, which have attracted thousands of spectators.{{sfnp|Cronin|Adair|2002 |pp=175–177}}

In the mid-1990s the government of the [[Republic of Ireland]] began a campaign to use St Patrick's Day to showcase Ireland and its culture.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historychannel.com/exhibits/stpatricksday/?page=history |title=The History of the Holiday |publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks |website=The History Channel |accessdate=17 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060807060038/http://www.historychannel.com/exhibits/stpatricksday/?page=history |archivedate=7 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government set up a group called St Patrick's Festival, with the aims:

{{quotation|
*To offer a national festival that ranks amongst all of the greatest celebrations in the world
*To create energy and excitement throughout Ireland via innovation, creativity, grassroots involvement, and marketing activity
*To provide the opportunity and motivation for people of Irish descent (and those who sometimes wish they were Irish) to attend and join in the imaginative and expressive celebrations
*To project, internationally, an accurate image of Ireland as a creative, professional and sophisticated country with wide appeal.&lt;ref name=festival&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stpatricksfestival.ie/index.php/about |title=St. Patrick's Festival was established by the Government of Ireland in November 1995 |accessdate=20 March 2012 |work=St. Patrick's Festival |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312093104/http://www.stpatricksfestival.ie/index.php/about |archive-date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first St Patrick's Festival was held on 17 March 1996. In 1997, it became a three-day event, and by 2000 it was a four-day event. By 2006, the festival was five days long; more than 675,000 people attended the 2009 parade. Overall 2009's five-day festival saw almost 1&amp;nbsp;million visitors, who took part in festivities that included concerts, outdoor theatre performances, and fireworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/st-patricks-day-facts/videos#history-of-st-patricks-day |title=St. Patrick's Day Facts Video  |publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks |website=History.com |accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Skyfest]] forms the centrepiece of the festival.

The topic of the 2004 St Patrick's Symposium was "Talking Irish", during which the nature of Irish identity, economic success, and the future were discussed. Since 1996, there has been a greater emphasis on celebrating and projecting a fluid and inclusive notion of "Irishness" rather than an identity based around traditional religious or ethnic allegiance. The week around St Patrick's Day usually involves [[Irish language]] speakers using more Irish during ''[[Seachtain na Gaeilge]]'' ("Irish Language Week").&lt;ref&gt;[https://dublin.ie/whats-on/listings/seachtain-na-gaeilge/ "Seachtain na Gaeilge", Dublin City Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian leaders in Ireland have expressed concern about the secularisation of St Patrick's Day. In ''The Word'' magazine's March 2007 issue, Fr [[Vincent Twomey]] wrote, "It is time to reclaim St Patrick's Day as a church festival". He questioned the need for "mindless alcohol-fuelled revelry" and concluded that "it is time to bring the piety and the fun together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=John Cooney |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/more-piety-fewer-pints-best-way-to-celebrate-26270094.html |title=More piety, fewer pints 'best way to celebrate' |work=The Irish Independent |date=12 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as Dublin, many other cities, towns, and villages in Ireland hold their own parades and festivals, including [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Belfast]], Derry, [[Galway]], [[Kilkenny]], [[Limerick]], and [[Waterford]].

The biggest celebrations outside the cities are in [[Downpatrick]], [[County Down]], where Saint Patrick is said to be buried. The shortest St. Patrick's Day parade in the world formerly took place in [[Dripsey]], [[County Cork]]. The parade lasted just 23.4 metres and traveled between the village's two pubs. The annual event began in 1999, but ceased after five years when one of the two pubs closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=Ireland of the Welcomes |url=http://www.dripsey.com/page16/page15/index.html |title=From Here to Here |author=Jo Kerrigan |volume=53 |issue=2 |date=March–April 2004 |via=Dripsey |accessdate=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, the [[Calgary Tower]] changed its top exterior lights to new green CFL bulbs just in time for St Patrick's Day. Part of an environmental non-profit organisation's campaign (Project Porchlight), the green represented environmental concerns. Approximately 210 lights were changed in time for Saint Patrick's Day, and resembled a [[Leprechaun]]'s hat. After a week, white CFLs took their place. The change was estimated to save the Calgary Tower some $12,000 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 104 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bevan |first=Alexis |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Calgary+Tower+gets+full+green+bulb+treatment/1378992/story.html |title=Calgary Tower gets full green bulb treatment |work=Calgary Herald |date=11 March 2009 |accessdate=17 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330025307/http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Calgary%2BTower%2Bgets%2Bfull%2Bgreen%2Bbulb%2Btreatment/1378992/story.html |archivedate=30 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''San Sebastian’s Walk''' is a religious catholic event with ecological and sport characteristics, which takes place the 20th of January of each year in the outskirts of the city of [[Maracay]], [[Aragua State]], in [[Venezuela]].

The route of this peregrination begins in [[El Limón, Venezuela|El Limón]] and finishes in the Main Church of [[Ocumare de la Costa]]. The route is 29.09 miles long crossing the mountains of the [[Henri Pittier National Park]] using the only paved route that unites the city of [[Maracay]] with the coastal zone of Venezuela.

==History==

The origin of this event is associated to Celso Bethencourt, who was born in [[Canary Islands]], Spain, and to Francesco Centrone, originally from Italy, who made this first route walking with no stops to fulfill a religious promise to Saint Sebastian, finishing their long walk the 20th of January 1987 in approximately 12 hours,  after this first peregrination Francesco Centrone continued making  this passage, every year on the same day; year after year making the long walk with family and friends, forming little by little a tradition.
In 1996 Centrone and a group created the Foundation Peregrination Saint Sebastian to continue with the walk. The Foundation manages the donations and the money to support social programs in the town of [[Ocumare de la Costa]] and to foster ecological plans on the route.

==Route==

The route consists on 7.8 miles of ascent, 12.4 miles  of slope and 6.2 miles of level ground. The route traditionally has multiple points at which assistance is available.

==Details==
There is a time limit to accomplish this walk of 12 hours.
Starting time is at 6:00 a.m.

He is most notable as the subject of an [[Urban legend|urban myth]] that he was previously [[Adolf Hitler]]'s "pet alligator."

Born in 1936 in the state of [[Mississippi]], [[United States]], Saturn soon was brought to [[Germany]], residing at the [[Berlin Zoological Garden]]. It was here his association with Adolf Hitler originated, as Hitler reportedly enjoyed visiting the zoo and especially liked the alligator. However, while Hitler may have viewed Saturn at the zoo, he was never Hitler's personal pet. During [[World War II]], the Berlin zoo was destroyed, but Saturn was discovered by British soldiers, who then gave the alligator to the Soviets in 1946. He has lived at the Moscow Zoo ever since, and has become one of the zoo's most famous and popular attractions.

During [[World War II]], much of the Berlin Zoo was destroyed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Of the zoo's 16,000 animals, only 96 survived.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When the [[aquarium]] building was destroyed by a bomb on 23 November 1943, 20 to 30 alligators and crocodiles were killed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Press reports documented that the streets near the aquarium were littered with alligator and [[crocodile]] corpses, but that some, including Saturn, had survived and were wandering through the city in search of food.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At the close of the war, the area where the Berlin Zoo is located came under the jurisdiction of the [[British Zone of Occupation]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In 1946, British soldiers discovered Saturn, and brought him to [[Leipzig]], then part of the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet Zone of Occupation]], where they gave Saturn to the Soviets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ultimatemoscowguide/posts/134735677008163:0|title=The last prisoner - Adolf Hitler’s pet... - Ultimate moscow guide {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the exact details of how Saturn came to Russia are unknown since the [[Moscow]] tourist office burnt down in the 1950s, it is known that the [[Red Army]] transported Saturn, along with an [[Python molurus|Indian python]], to Moscow in July 1946, and brought him to live in the [[Moscow Zoo]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://old.themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/1994/2/article/130-years-of-history-at-the-city-zoo/351143.html|title=130 Years of History at the City Zoo|last=Dukess|first=Karen|date=15 February 1994|work=The Moscow Times|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the alligator arrived at the Moscow Zoo, he was instantly a popular attraction, as there were only two crocodiles at the zoo and no other alligators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His German origins earned him the nickname 'Hitler', but he was later given the name 'Saturn'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1993, when Russian tanks were moving down the [[Garden Ring]] after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], Saturn cried out because of the vibrations, which a zookeeper thinks reminded him of the [[Battle of Berlin]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In the 1950s, the United States gave the Soviet Union a younger, female alligator as a gift.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; She was named Shipka, and she and Saturn began [[mating]], although they did not produce any offspring, as all the eggs Shipka produced have been infertile.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Shipka, who was thirty years younger than Saturn, later died, and Saturn was so distressed by her death that he refused food for a time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By 2005, Saturn had a new mate, who was then thirty years old.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In his time at the Moscow Zoo, Saturn has had several narrow escapes from death. In the 1980s, a slab of concrete fell from the aquarium's ceiling into the alligator enclosure, but luckily for Saturn, he had made his way to a protective niche beforehand.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1990, a new aquarium building was built, but Saturn resisted the move, refusing to eat for four months and becoming close to death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once, a drunk visitor threw a boulder on his head to wake him up, after which zoo veterinarians fought to keep him alive for months.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another time, a group of tourists threw glass bottles at Saturn, injuring him.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; After these incidents, the enclosure was made more secure with the addition of thick glass wall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In the 2010s, Saturn once again stopped eating, this time for nearly a year.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Zoo staff took blood samples for analysis, and injected him with vitamins to try to keep him alive.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; He did eventually resume eating.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Today, Saturn spends much of his time sleeping. He eats a diet of fish, rabbits, and rats twice a week.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Vladimir Kudriavzew, the head of the Moscow Zoo's reptile department, says that not many visitors today know of Saturn's eventful history.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Today, zoo staff only relate Saturn's German origins to groups of visiting schoolchildren.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When school classes come, the zookeepers allow children to stick the end of a broomstick into the enclosure, which is safe because Saturn is known as generally peaceful.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His only violent incident occurred in 1970, when he tried to bite an inexperienced warden who had tried to feed him by hand.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2015, the Moscow Zoo renovated the Terrarium, where the alligator enclosure is located.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moscowzoo.su/about-zoo/news/novosti-zooparka/our-terrarium-has-opened-after-reconstruction/|title=Our Terrarium has opened after reconstruction|last=|first=|date=|website=moscowzoo.su|publisher=Moscow Zoo|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new interior and reconstructed enclosure was completed, and Saturn returned to public display.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Also in 2015, Saturn became sponsored by the French clothing company [[Lacoste]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Smart Start, Inc.''' is a [[Texas]] company that provides services and technologies that prevent [[Drunk drivers|intoxicated drivers]] from operating a vehicle. Smart Start, Inc. manufactures, installs, monitors and services the [[Ignition system|ignition]] [[Ignition interlock device|interlock devices]]. In almost all cases, these devices are installed by court order due to [[Driving under the influence|DUI]] or [[DWI]] violations.

Smart Start, Inc. was founded in 1993 by Jay and Bettye Rodgers and is headquartered in [[Irving, Texas]]. In 2016 the company filed a lawsuit against the [[Minnesota Department of Public Safety|Minnesota DPS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kstp.com/news/interlock-ignition-gps-tracking-minnesota-department-of-public-safety-smart-start-breathalyzer-law-/4326401/|title=Lawsuit Claims Minnesota Department of Public Safety Violated Constitutional Rights of Ignition Interlock Users|work=KSTP|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company alleges that the use of GPS trackers to track persons convicted of DUI violates the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minnlawyer.com/2017/01/12/ignition-interlock-data-public-commissioner-admits/|title=Ignition interlock data public, commissioner admits – Minnesota Lawyer|last=Featherly|first=Kevin|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart Start claims to have installed over 200,000 ignition interlock devices and reports that these devices have prevented over 7 million vehicle starts due to potential drivers being over the approved limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smartstartinc.com/index.php/products/in-house | title=Smart Start IN-HOM?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2957">{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2015}} Subsistence crisis can be defined as an extreme situation where the basic means of livelihood are endangered. In France, due to the rapid expansion of the population from 23 million in 1715 to 28 million in 1789, a subsistence crisis occurred. A '''subsistence crisis''' is a crisis caused by economic factors (generally high food prices), which in turn may be caused by either natural or man-made factors,&lt;ref name=Helsinki&gt;"The European subsistence crisis of 1845-1850: a comparative 
perspective", http://www.helsinki.fi/iehc2006/papers3/Vanhaute.pdf, 20 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; which threatens the food supplies and the survival prospects of large numbers of people (it is considered [[famine]] if it is extremely severe and large numbers of lives are lost). A subsistence crisis can be considered genuine if it is visible in [[demographic]] data.

It was in France that the notion of a '''subsistence crisis''' was first formulated by Meuvret in 1946, and greatly popularised by Goubert in 1960 through his influential study of the Beauvaisis in [[Beauvais]].&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;Walter, John, and Roger S. Schofield. "Famine, Disease and the Social Order in Early Modern Society". Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989. Print., https://books.google.com/books?id=uCERvGiMYdIC&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=france%20subsistence%20crisis&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q=france%20subsistence%20crisis&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of subsistence crises, in its contemporary guise, was first formulated by Meuvret in 1946. As an economic historian and specialist in price history Meuvret was struck by the coincidence between high prices and the increase in the number of deaths in the region of Gien in 1709–10. He then posed the problem of the nature of demographic crises, very tentatively at first, since he thought it was a hopeless quest to try to distinguish statistically between phenomena that were so closely associated: namely, mortality through simple inanition (starvation); mortality caused by disease, though attributable to malnutrition; and mortality by contagion, which in turn was linked to the scarcity that helped both spawn diseases and spread them through the migration of poor beggars.&lt;ref name=Cambridge /&gt;

==Examples of subsistence crises==
*The one prior to the [[French revolution]], in which two years of [[crop failures]] and [[Crop yield|low yields]] caused a [[grain]] shortage.
*The [[Great Famine of 1315–1317]]
*The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in Ireland. By the mid-1800s, the Irish had been living for decades in extreme poverty, which worsened the repeated and total failure of the potato crop, the [[starvation]], which was worsened by the [[Colony|colonial]] [[British Empire]] with ineffective [[famine relief projects]], [[evictions]] and [[emigration]] under duress, which often led to illness.

'''''The Black Pimpernel''''' ({{lang-sv|Svarta nejlikan}}; {{lang-es|El Clavel negro}}) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] drama film directed by [[Ulf Hultberg]] and starring [[Michael Nyqvist]] and [[Lisa Werlinder]]. The film also features [[Kate Del Castillo]], [[Luis Gnecco]] and [[Claire Ross-Brown]] in a minor part.

The film is about [[Harald Edelstam]], Sweden’s ambassador to [[Chile]], who after the military coup of [[Augusto Pinochet]] in 1973, managed to save the lives of more than 1,300 people by taking them to his embassy and transporting them to Sweden.

His name comes from the fictional hero [[The Scarlet Pimpernel]] who saved many lives during the [[French Revolution]].

The film was shot in Chile in the spring of 2006 and opened September 14, 2007.

'''The Black Woman Is God'''&amp;nbsp;is a recurring group exhibition of Black women artists curated by Karen Seneferu and Melorra Green, which started in 2013 and in 2016 and 2017 has been located at the San Francisco city-owned nonprofit art space [[SOMArts]]. The exhibitions challenge a popular western mindset of [[God]] as a white male and instead explores new images showing "The Black Woman is God".

== History ==

=== 2013 Exhibition at the African American Art &amp; Culture Complex ===
The first iteration of The Black Woman is God was intended as a solo exhibition for Seneferu, curated by Green, at the African American Art &amp; Culture Complex. Seneferu agreed to participate in the exhibition only if other black female artists were included&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/art/article/A-room-full-of-art-affirms-The-Black-Woman-Is-8392070.php|title=A room full of art affirms ‘The Black Woman Is God’|work=SFGate|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The exhibition included 20 visual and performance artists. The opening reception also included a performing arts show as part of the exhibition and was called "vibrant and magnificent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sfbayview.com/2013/04/the-black-woman-is-god/|title=‘The Black Woman Is God’|work=San Francisco Bay View|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sfbayview.com/2013/05/the-black-woman-is-god-part-ii/|title=‘The Black Woman Is God’ – Part II|work=San Francisco Bay View|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://peopleseye.photoshelter.com/gallery-collection/The-Black-Woman-Is-God/C0000Lih_hWEMNkk|title=The Black Woman Is God {{!}} PEOPLE'S EYE PHOTOGRAPHY|website=peopleseye.photoshelter.com|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This exhibit asserts Black women’s power and beauty and does not seek to devalue any other group in the process..... It applies pressure to the beliefs and values undergirding the laws and policies that exclude Black women’s lives from economic policymaking and their labor from economic value and protection."

=== 2017 Exhibition ===
The third iteration of The Black Woman is God, also curated by Karen Seneferu and Melorra Green, returned to SOMArts on July 20, 2017, running through August 26, 2017. The exhibition has the work of 80 artists on view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.somarts.org/theblackwomanisgod2017|title=The Black Woman is God, July 20–August 26, 2017 — SOMArts|website=www.somarts.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oaklandpost.org/2017/07/14/80-women-artists-annual-black-woman-god-exhibit/|title=80 Women Artists Showcased in Annual “Black Woman Is God” Exhibit|last=by|date=2017-07-14|website=Oakland Post|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; SOMArts, the [[California Digital Library]] and [[Art Practical]] held a Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon on July 22 in conjunction with the exhibition "to raise the online visibility of Black women artists and challenge the gaps in art history that erase or minimize Black women’s contributions as artists, activists and social change-makers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.somarts.org/theblackwomanisgodwikipedia/|title=The Black Woman is God Wikipedia Edit-a-thon|website=www.somarts.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Théâtre de l’Ambigu-Comique''' ({{IPA-fr|teɑtʁ də lɑ̃biɡy kɔmik|pron}}, literally, Theatre of the Comic-Ambiguity), a former Parisian theatre, was founded in 1769 on the [[boulevard du Temple]] immediately adjacent to the [[Théâtre de Nicolet]]. It was rebuilt in 1770 and 1786, but in 1827 was destroyed by fire. A new, larger theatre with a capacity of 2,000 as compared to the earlier 1,250 was built nearby on the boulevard Saint-Martin at its intersection with the rue de Bondy and opened the following year.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick 1993, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was eventually demolished in 1966.

==History of the first theatre in the boulevard du Temple==

It was founded in 1769 on the [[boulevard du Temple]], originally known as the Promenades des Ramparts, in Paris by [[Nicolas-Médard Audinot]], formerly a comedian of the [[Opéra-Comique]], which he had left to become a puppet-master at the Paris fairs. Audinot had already been a success in one of the sites of the [[Saint-Germain Fair]], where his large [[marionette]]s (called "bamboches") were in vogue.

Under the name of his foundation, the "Comédiens de bois", the Opéra-Comique proposed [[pantomime]]s and "féeries" (spectacles), then he enlarged his repertoire to include marionettes, child-performers, and [[acrobatics|acrobat]]s, in comedies, [[vaudeville]] shows, "opéras comiques", dramas and pantomimes.

The variety and mix of these theatrical modes justified and explained changing the theatre's name, after only one year, from "Comédiens de bois" to "Ambigu-Comique" when Audinot substituted child-performers for marionettes.  Audinot also used wooden puppets to spitefully reenact his former colleagues from the Comédie Italienne. Audinot saved the profits he made from shows and constructed a permanent theatre building on the Boulevard du Temple, which officially opened on July 9, 1769.&lt;ref&gt;Hemmings 1994, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The following April, Audinot added to his puppets with a few young children, who he trained up in the theatrical arts, and painted the motto "Sicut infantes audi nos" on the theatre's curtain.  His success caused [[Jacques Delille|Delille]] to write "Dear Audinot, childhood attired as old age".

The architectural success of the theatre was mostly due to the ambitious and inventive set designer, Louis Daguerre.  Daguerre, who is also credited with developing early photography and diorama theatre (1822), was an expert in scenic and lighting design and created picturesque effects within the theatre.

[[Image:Plans of the theatres Ambigu-Comique and Gaîté on the Boulevard du Temple - Carlson 1966 p226.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Plans of the Ambigu-Comique (left) and the Théâtre de [[Jean-Baptiste Nicolet|Nicolet]] ([[Théâtre de la Gaîté (boulevard du Temple)]], right), on the boulevard du Temple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ambigu-Comique and the Gaîté had a smaller number of boxes for privileged clientele than other Parisian theatres. These were separated by only half partitions that were more steeply angled toward the stage. The boxes usually found at the rear of a theatre were replaced with galleries of benches which seated more people. These arrangements provided more patrons with a better view of the stage, rather than a view of the other members of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson 1966, p. 226; McCormick 1993, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A Conseil decision of 1771 (demanded by the Opéra) banned singing, dancing, and having more than four musicians aroused such emotion that it was revoked only a few days later, and Audinot took full advantage of the situation.  Judging, in 1772, that the time was right to extend the building, he gave up puppetry altogether, replacing them entirely with child-performers.  Not entirely released from the ties which had brought about his rise in the large theatres, from 1780 he had to pay the Opéra a fee for representation and to engage him but not use him, in producing ballets and lyric pieces borrowed for that scene, whose shows had at least ten years of publicity.  The Comédie-Française and the Comédie-Italienne stipulated, for their part, that dialogue pieces in the repertoire would be submitted to them before being played, so they could edit and change them to their own advantage.

Despite these problems and burdens, the Ambigu was able to rebuild and enlarge its theatre in 1786. Audinot sustained the fashion for "pantomimes historiques and "pantomimes romanesques" such as "Belle au bois dormant", "Masque de fer", "Forêt-Noire", and "Capitaine Cook". The Ambigu's success was equally down to the "comédies graveleuses" written by its official writers [[Roger-Timothée Régnard de Pleinchesne|Plainchesne]] and [[Pierre-Louis Moline|Moline]]. [[Louis Petit de Bachaumont|Bachaumont]] even noted in 1771 that Audinot's theatre was better attended than the Opéra.

Being located on the Boulevard du Temple amongst several other successful theaters created a healthy competition and a spark that the Ambigu used to strive to achieve greatness.  Some of the theaters along the Boulevard included Theatre de Nicolet, Theatre des Associes, Theatre des Delassement-Comiques, and many others.  The Comedie Francais, which was established back in 1680 and was certainly well-known throughout Europe, coexisted with the Ambigu and, therefore, they competed each other for an audience.  However, l’Ambigu’s biggest rival was Théâtre Feydeau.  The Feydeau was closed by the government due to the social “turbulence” it invoked, and on February 3, 1795 Théâtre de l’Ambigu showed a production of "Le Concert de la rue Feydeau."  This production was a satirical piece and a supposedly “lighthearted attack” against The Feydeau which was taken the wrong way to many viewers and caused “angry crowds to surround the Ambigu for two evenings until the Committee of Public Saftety demanded that the play be withdrawn in the interests of public tranquility” (Carlson.)

The proclamation of the freedom of the theatres in 1791 gave rise to a large number of rivals to the Ambigu, which was forced to close in 1799. In 1801, Audinot inaugurated a [[melodrama]] with [[Guilbert de Pixérécourt]], [[Louis-Charles Caigniez|Caigniez]] and [[Victor Henri-Joseph Brahain Ducange|Victor Ducange]].  In addition to the big name of Pixerecourt, actor Frederick Lemaitre played “Robert Macaire,” a classic villain in many French plays, in 1823 with outstanding success.  After Audinot stepped down as the director, one of the company’s actors named Picardeaux took over, followed by Andre Coffin-Rosny, then Hector Chaussier, and another actor, Cammaile Saint-Aubin. The Ambigu's building burned down on 13 July 1827.

The theatre was rebuilt to plans by the architects [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]] and [[Jean-François-Joseph Lecointe]] on the [[boulevard Saint-Martin]], at the corner of [[rue de Bondy]] (now [[rue René-Boulanger]]).  The 19th century saw the Ambigu's success augmented, so much so that its grand spectacles, dramas, melodramas, "[[boulevard theatre (aesthetic)|pièces de boulevard]]" and vaudeville shows remain the most faithful representation of the dramatic traditions of what is called "the [[Boulevard du Crime|boulevard of crime]]" ("le boulevard du crime").

Productions of adapted novels were successful such as Émile Zola’s ''L’Assommoir'' in 1879 and ''Nana'' in 1881.

[[Image:Albert Guillaume - Gigolette.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Poster for an 1896 production at the Theâtre]]

===20th century===
In the 1920s, the building was briefly turned into a cinema.  In 1954, the comedian [[Christian Casadesus]] reopened the Théâtre de l'Ambigu, and plays were staged there once again, by contemporary authors such as [[François Billetdoux]] and [[Roger Vitrac]]. In 1966, despite several demonstrations and a spectacular parade by the whole theatrical profession, the theatre was closed for good and demolished.  The department of [[André Malraux]], minister of culture, promised that the auditorium, then the whole building, would be preserved, when demolition works had already begun.

The '''University of Hong Kong pro-vice-chancellor selection controversy''' surrounds alleged political interference behind the [[University of Hong Kong]] governing council's rejection of [[Johannes Chan]]'s recommended appointment to the post of [[pro-vice-chancellor]] in charge of staffing and resources. Chan, dean of the [[University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]] from 2002 until 2014, had been unanimously recommended for the post by a selection committee headed by university president [[Peter Mathieson (professor)|Peter Mathieson]]. The governing council's decision, the first time that a candidate selected by the committee has been rejected, is widely viewed as political retaliation for Chan's involvement with pro-democratic figures including his former subordinate [[Benny Tai]]. A majority of HKU Council members are not students or staff of the university, and many are directly appointed by incumbent HKSAR Chief executive [[Leung Chun-ying]]. The decision has received international condemnation, and is being viewed as part of a Beijing-backed curtailing of [[academic freedom]]s that will damage Hong Kong's academic reputation.&lt;ref name=WSJ151007&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong University Purge: Pro-Beijing forces target a top school's leaders to intimidate professors|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-university-purge-1444261236|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=7 October 2015}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to his liberal political stance, criticism of Chan by media controlled by the Communist Party of China was stepped up as soon as his candidacy for the post became known.&lt;ref name=hundreds&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zhao|first1=Shirley|last2=Ng|first2=Joyce|title=Hundreds sign petition urging University of Hong Kong to end delay of liberal scholar's appointment|work=South China Morning Post|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was derided in ''[[Ta Kung Pao]]'' and ''[[Wen Wei Po]]'', which together published more than 350 articles attacking him and accusing him of "meddling in politics" for his involvement with pro-democratic figures including his former subordinate [[Benny Tai]].&lt;ref name=hkfpexplainer/&gt;&lt;ref name=straits&gt;{{cite news|title=1,000 in silent HK uni protest to defend academic freedom|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/1000-in-silent-hk-uni-protest-to-defend-academic-freedom|work=[[The Straits Times]]|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ng|first1=Joyce|title=HKU law professors unite to denounce Wen Wei Po attack on Johannes Chan|work=South China Morning Post|date=13 February 2015|page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ejinsightjuly2&gt;{{cite news|title=HKU delays pro vice chancellor appointment – again|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20150702-hku-delays-pro-vice-chancellor-appointment-again/|work=Hong Kong Economic Journal|date=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communist Party-controlled newspaper ''[[Global Times]]'' also bashed Chan, calling him a "ringleader" of the [[2014 Hong Kong protests|2014 pro-democratic protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zeng|first1=Vivienne|title=State-run Global Times slams 'Occupy ringleader' Johannes Chan over HKU appointment row|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/09/30/state-run-global-times-slams-occupy-ringleader-johannes-chan-over-hku-appointment-row/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chan's treatment in Beijing-controlled media has been described as a [[smear campaign]] and [[character assassination]].&lt;ref name=scmp25sept&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Jerome A.|last2=Cheung|first2=Alvin|title=Delay in HKU appointment of Johannes Chan makes a mockery of Beijing's pledged support for rule of law|work=South China Morning Post|date=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chu&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chu|first1=Winston Ka-sun|title=Bickering over HKU job raises fears about academic freedom|work=South China Morning Post|date=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smeared/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes7oct&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Mike|title=China Doesn't Know How To Treat An International Financial Center|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikegonzalez3/2015/10/07/china-doesnt-know-how-to-treat-an-international-financial-center/|work=Forbes|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Council composition===
The HKU Council normally comprises 24 members, although in mid-2015 two seats were vacant and Margaret Leung served in two roles. Two further members, Yuen Kwok-yung and Aloysius Arokiaraj, resigned in July but continued to serve on the council until their replacements were elected. The council's ''Guide and Code of Practice'' includes a confidentiality clause. It was updated in August 2015 to state that "it is ''absolutely'' necessary to keep confidential the council agenda, supporting papers and minutes", while the previous version (from 2004) had stated less strictly, "it is ''normally'' necessary".&lt;ref name=transparency/&gt;

The decision not to appoint Chan is seen as a pro-government act of retaliation against "pro-democracy leaders and participants" and a blow to academic freedom.&lt;ref name=scmpchan/&gt;&lt;ref name=csm1/&gt; This is partly because six members of the council are directly appointed by the [[Chief executive of Hong Kong]], who acts as chancellor of all publicly funded tertiary institutions in the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lo|first1=Alex|title=Chief executive as chancellor of Hong Kong universities is an anachronism|url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1838191/chief-executive-chancellor-hong-kong-universities?page=all|work=South China Morning Post|date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five members are delegates to the [[National People's Congress]] in Beijing, and as such are obliged to toe the Communist Party line or otherwise risk expulsion.&lt;ref name=nytimes11&gt;{{cite news|last1=Forsythe|first1=Michael|title=Vote at Hong Kong University Stirs Concern Over Beijing's Influence|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/world/asia/hong-kong-university-votes-against-promoting-johannes-chan.html|work=The New York Times|date=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In overall council makeup, university students and staff are outnumbered by members from outside the university.&lt;ref name=nytimes11/&gt;

Customarily the HKU Council accepts the recommendations of search committees for senior posts, with no prior recommendation having been rejected by the council in the university's history.&lt;ref name=scmpchan/&gt;&lt;ref name=csm1/&gt;&lt;ref name=voa1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huang|first1=Joyce|title=Beijing Seen as Meddling in Hong Kong University Election|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/beijing-seen-as-meddling-in-hong-kong-university-election/2986995.html|publisher=Voice of America|date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university initiated a worldwide search for five pro-vice-chancellors in mid-2014. Two of them, Ian Holliday and Douglas So, were appointed in November 2014. Another two, Andy Hor and John Kao, were appointed in March 2015 to commence employment in September 2015. The sole candidate for position of pro-vice-chancellor (academic staffing and resources), recommended by unanimity, was Johannes Chan.&lt;ref name=20150702hongkongfp&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/07/02/hku-alumni-petition-against-delay-in-pro-democracy-scholars-promotion/|title=HKU alumni petition against delay in pro-democracy scholar's promotion |work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news of the selection committee's recommendation was broken by ''Wen Wei Po'' in a feature report "in the best interest of the public" even before the HKU council had been informed of the selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wong|first1=Joseph Wing-ping|title=Will govt take the right decision on HKU Council?|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20151109-will-govt-take-the-right-decision-on-hku-council/|work=Hong Kong Economic Journal|date=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chan then became the target of a concerted attack by ''Wen Wei Po'' and ''Ta Kung Po'' for his academic record.&lt;ref name=20150212ejinsight&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20150212-apple-daily-leung-tried-to-stop-chans-hku-appointment/|title=Apple Daily: Leung tried to stop Chan's HKU appointment|work=EJ Insight|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?art_id=153939&amp;con_type=1 "Ex-HKU dean feels Beijing media heat"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004125855/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?art_id=153939&amp;con_type=1 |date=4 October 2015 }}. ''The Standard'', 4 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wen Wei Po'', citing from a leaked University Grants Commission report, stated that Chan's academic record on research was not up to international standards while he was dean of the law school.

''The Standard'', 27 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article by Kevin Lau in ''Ming Pao'', parties close to the government applied pressure on committee members behind the scenes to block Chan's appointment.&lt;ref name=20150212ejinsight/&gt;&lt;ref name=20150213hks/&gt;&lt;ref name="nextmedia.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=傳政府阻港大陳文敏升職 羅范：點會重蹈覆轍|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/realtime/news/20150212/53429851|work=Apple Daily|date=12 February 2015|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief executive [[Leung Chun-ying]] was reported to have telephoned members of the committee to persuade them to vote against Chan's appointment,&lt;ref name=20150213hks/&gt; whilst Sophia Kao, member of the [[Central Policy Unit]], admitted that she may have mentioned Chan's candidature to someone "casually" but said she did not recall with whom and in what context.&lt;ref name=ejinsight20150213&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20150213-top-leung-adviser-i-might-have-discussed-chan-with-certain-people/|title=Leung adviser: I might have discussed Chan with certain people|work=EJ Insight|date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hkej.com/instantnews/current/article/989711/%E9%AB%98%E9%9D%9C%E8%8A%9D%E6%89%BF%E8%AA%8D%E3%80%8C%E8%8C%B6%E9%A4%98%E9%A3%AF%E5%BE%8C%E3%80%8D%E6%9B%BE%E8%A8%8E%E8%AB%96%E9%99%B3%E6%96%87%E6%95%8F%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6|title=高靜芝承認「茶餘飯後」曾討論陳文敏事件|publisher=hkej.com|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20150212yahoo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hk.news.yahoo.com/%E9%83%AD%E6%A6%AE%E9%8F%97-%E9%AB%98%E9%9D%9C%E8%8A%9D%E8%BA%AB%E5%88%86%E7%89%B9%E6%AE%8A-%E6%98%AF%E5%90%A6%E4%B8%BB%E5%8B%95%E8%AB%87%E9%99%B3%E6%96%87%E6%95%8F%E9%83%BD%E6%9C%89%E5%95%8F%E9%A1%8C-131000147.html|title=郭榮鏗：高靜芝身分特殊　是否主動談陳文敏都有問題|date=12 February 2015|publisher=Yahoo!

''The Standard''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[i-Cable Communications|i-Cable]] and ''South China Morning Post'' subsequently revealed that CY Leung had convened at least three meetings with Peter Mathieson within four months during the period the decision was being deferred. On one occasion, Leung allegedly met Mathieson with HKU council chairman Leong Chee-hung and education secretary Eddie Ng. Although Ng said he had no recollection of the meeting, the [[Office of the Chief executive]] did not deny that such a meeting had taken place.&lt;ref name=20151010nextmedia&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mak|first1=Chi-wing|last2=Poon|first2=Pak-lam|last3=Chu|first3=Chun-wing|title=校委表決副校任命前　梁三晤馬斐森 4,000人港大抗政治黑手|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20151010/19328048|work=Apple Daily|date=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20151009scmp&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheung|first1=Gary|title=CY Leung met HKU vice-chancellor Peter Mathieson in weeks leading up to controversial Johannes Chan snub|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/1865423/cy-leung-met-hku-vice-chancellor-peter-mathieson|work=South China Morning Post|date=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The council was criticised when it repeatedly deferred the decision to appoint Chan, stating that it should wait until a new provost was in place. The decision was repeatedly delayed through votes on 30 June and 28 July. Just after the council voted down a motion to stop delaying the appointment at the latter meeting, dozens of students rushed into the conference room in protest.&lt;ref name="student leader"/&gt; During the incident, council member Lo Chung-mau fell down and alleged he was pushed over. He said his knee was injured; he reported this to the police and was taken to hospital. Students' union president Billy Fung expressed disbelief that Lo was injured by a student.&lt;ref name="student leader"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheung|first1=Tony|title=HKU student leader refuses to rule out more protests over delay in appointment of liberal scholar to key role|work=South China Morning Post|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online videos appeared to show Lo fainting or falling on his own.

The students' storming of the conference was denounced by vice-chancellor Peter Mathieson, as well as the ten university deans who issued a statement urging "all parties to put the interest of the university first" and expressing conviction in the guarantee of academic freedom and university autonomy by the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] Article 137.&lt;ref name="student leader"/&gt; Council member Arthur Li compared the students to the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] of the [[Cultural Revolution]] who tortured intellectuals.&lt;ref name=topsci/&gt;

On the other hand, 15 ex-presidents of the university released a joint statement supporting the students and expressing regret that Mathieson and the incumbent university deans had condemned the protest. The presidents called the demonstration a "righteous action of the students to safeguard the academic freedom and university's autonomy."&lt;ref name=topsci/&gt; They said the composition of the current council, stacked with pro-government members from outside the university, violated the principle of institutional autonomy.&lt;ref name=topsci/&gt; Billy Fung said that the storming of the conference room helped bring the issue into the public spotlight.&lt;ref name="student leader"/&gt;

Following the postponement of 30 June, the postgraduate student representative, Aloysius Arokiaraj, resigned from the council in frustration, stating that the decisions "[fell] short of my expected standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ng|first1=Joyce|last2=Lam|first2=Jeffie|title=HKU struggles to contain fallout over delayed appointment of Johannes Chan Man-mun as pro-vice-chancellor|work=South China Morning Post|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he tendered his resignation on 3 July, Arokiaraj remained on the council so that the position was not left vacant while a replacement is found.&lt;ref name=hkfpexplainer/&gt;&lt;ref name=topsci/&gt; At the meeting on 28 July Arokiaraj voted against the deferral but in a letter to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' he criticised students' angry conduct during the storming of the conference room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zhao|first1=Shirley|title=University of Hong Kong PhD student criticises appointment delay, but unhappy over chaos|work=South China Morning Post|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Respected microbiologist [[Yuen Kwok-yung]], considered a "neutral party" in the controversy, also resigned following the incident. He criticised both the students and the university governance, stating that he was "incapable of dealing with the politics in the university council". He dismissed Arthur Li's likening of the students to Red Guards, stating that the behaviour of the Hong Kong students was not as serious.&lt;ref name=topsci/&gt; Like Arokiaraj, Yuen continued to serve on the council until his replacement was elected.&lt;ref name=topsci&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheung|first1=Tony|last2=Cheung|first2=Gary|title=Top scientist quits HKU council, warning students against 'opening door to Satan' with violence|work=South China Morning Post|date=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of July an alumni concern group had collected more than 3,000 signatures demanding the council stop delaying the decision. It was signed by numerous legislators and HKU alumni including [[Ip Kin-yuen]], [[Sin Chung-kai]], [[Alan Leong]], [[Tanya Chan]], [[Audrey Eu]], [[Paul Zimmerman (politician)|Paul Zimmerman]], [[Joseph Wong]], [[Anson Chan]], [[Andrew Wong (politician)|Andrew Wong]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zhao|first1=Shirley|title=HKU students rally to call for end to delay in appointment of liberal scholar to key position|work=South China Morning Post|date=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathieson complained that he and others who had backed the appointment of Johannes Chan as pro-vice-chancellor had been subjected to "orchestrated" pressure by some political elements, his personal emails having been hacked and some of it published in pro-Beijing media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HKU's Mathieson suspects political hand in Johannes Chan saga|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20150930-hkus-mathieson-suspects-political-hand-in-johannes-chan-saga/|work=Hong Kong Economic Journal|date=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 September, the council rejected Chan's appointment (12 votes to 8) through a secret ballot in a closed meeting; no reason for the decision was disclosed.&lt;ref name=hkfpexplainer/&gt; Political motivations were widely suspected and the opacity of the council criticised.&lt;ref name=csm1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marquand|first1=Robert|title=China meddles in Hong Kong rejection of top university figure|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2015/0930/China-meddles-in-Hong-Kong-rejection-of-top-university-figure|work=The Christian Science Monitor|date=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the suggestion of a council member, all phones had been taken away and sealed in envelopes for the duration of the meeting to prevent anyone leaking information to the media.&lt;ref name=transparency&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zhao|first1=Shirley|last2=Ng|first2=Joyce|title=University of Hong Kong council leak prompts debate over transparency|work=South China Morning Post|date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the meeting, dozens of protesters from two pro-Beijing groups stood outside the venue and denigrated Chan as "incompetent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HKU Council rejects pro-vice-chancellor choice|url=http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1214351-20150929.htm|work=Radio Television Hong Kong|date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Billy Fung disclosures===
[[File:Billy Fung Jing-en.jpg|thumbnail|Student representative Billy Fung]]
Billy Fung, attending the meeting as president of the [[Hong Kong University Students' Union]], stated that some council members said Chan was not qualified to be pro-vice-chancellor because he lacked a doctorate degree, and quoted member Arthur Li as stating that Chan may have been appointed dean of law simply because he is a "nice guy"; Lo Chung-mau complained that Chan had not shown him enough sympathy after he fell down during the meeting of 28 July.&lt;ref name=scmpfinalvote/&gt;&lt;ref name=scmp1862650/&gt; Fung said that of the eight who voted for Chan's appointment, seven were staff and students of the university.&lt;ref name=scmpfinalvote&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zhao|first1=Shirley|last2=Ng|first2=Joyce|last3=Chan|first3=Gloria|title=University of Hong Kong's council votes 12–8 to reject Johannes Chan's appointment as pro-vice-chancellor|work=South China Morning Post|date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HKU Council chairman [[Edward Leong]] called Fung's leak a "deplorable action", accusing him of using "dishonest means to achieve his aim". He said that if the council discussions were open, it would discourage free discussion.&lt;ref name=scmpfinalvote/&gt; Other council members criticised Fung's integrity, but refused to reveal what they had said during the meeting.&lt;ref name=swinging/&gt; Council members Lo Chung-mau and Arthur Li accused Fung of lying about the discussions.&lt;ref name=scmp1862650&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/1862650/going-down-swinging-university-hong-kongs|title=Going down swinging: University of Hong Kong's Johannes Chan decries political interference and wants reasons after appointment defeat|date=30 September 2015|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scmp1863459&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/1863459/university-hong-kong-council-member-accuses|title=University of Hong Kong council member accuses student of 'dishonest means' in Johannes Chan decision uproar|date=2 October 2015|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20151029ejinsight&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20151029-how-arthur-li-is-getting-a-dose-of-his-own-medicine/|title=How Arthur Li is getting a dose of his own medicine|work=EJ Insight|date=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChanResponse"/&gt; Leonie Ki, another council member, alleged that Fung's English language proficiency was so low that he could not understand what was being discussed during the council meetings.&lt;ref name=20151006thestandard&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chugani|first1=Michael|title=Spilling the beans on lousy English|url=http://thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=5&amp;art_id=161844&amp;sid=45315849&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20151006&amp;fc=4|work=The Standard|date=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three council members, including Ki, had spoken against Chan for making a high-profiled claim that he was the only candidate, whereas in fact the revelations were made only after a highly placed source leaked the fact to ''Wen Wei Po''.&lt;ref name="ChanResponse"&gt;{{cite news|date=30 September 2015|publisher=DBC|url=http://www.dbc.hk/radio2/news-detail/Id/95428/type/10/%E3%80%90%E6%B8%AF%E5%A4%A7%E9%A2%A8%E6%B3%A2%E3%80%91%E9%99%B3%E6%96%87%E6%95%8F%E5%8F%8D%E9%A7%81%E6%A0%A1%E5%8B%99%E5%A7%94%E5%93%A1%E6%9C%83%E5%B0%8D%E4%BB%96%E7%9A%84%E6%89%B9%E8%A9%95|title=【港大風波】陳文敏反駁校務委員會對他的批評|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017234418/http://www.dbc.hk/radio2/news-detail/Id/95428/type/10/%E3%80%90%E6%B8%AF%E5%A4%A7%E9%A2%A8%E6%B3%A2%E3%80%91%E9%99%B3%E6%96%87%E6%95%8F%E5%8F%8D%E9%A7%81%E6%A0%A1%E5%8B%99%E5%A7%94%E5%93%A1%E6%9C%83%E5%B0%8D%E4%BB%96%E7%9A%84%E6%89%B9%E8%A9%95|archivedate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education professor Li Hui said that Fung was "too young" to understand what is fair.&lt;ref name=scmprow/&gt; Pro-Beijing legislator [[Christopher Chung]] called for Fung to be removed.&lt;ref name=transparency/&gt; Fung responded to criticism by stating that upholding institutional transparency is more important than the confidentiality rules.&lt;ref name=20151002hongkongfp&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arora|first1=Medhavi|title=Hero or traitor?

=== Audio recordings leaked ===
A recording of the proceedings was obtained by [[Commercial Radio Hong Kong]], which then broadcast excerpts of the discussions in late October featuring Arthur Li and Leonie Ki that confirmed the relevant parts of Billy Fung's accounts.&lt;ref name=20151028hongkongfp&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheng|first1=Kris|title=Leaked HKU Council recording confirms reasons behind Johannes Chan rejection|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/10/28/leaked-hku-council-recording-confirms-reasons-behind-johannes-chan-rejection/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university, citing breach of confidentiality, sought and obtained an interim court order banning the radio station and "persons unknown" from publishing material from the confidential meetings; council chairman Edward Leong said the court order was sought to "protect the dignity of HKU."&lt;ref name=scmp1874312&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/1874312/university-hong-kong-obtains-court-injunction|title=University of Hong Kong obtains court injunction to prevent further council meeting leaks|date=30 October 2015|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20151102hongkongfp&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/11/02/media-unions-hit-back-as-hku-gagging-order-may-allow-for-republishing-of-leaked-council-tapes/|title=Media unions hit back as HKU gagging order may allow for republishing of leaked Council tapes|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20151106ejinsight/&gt; The council, which had voted to suspend Fung from future meetings, authorised the hiring of a security professional in an attempt to identify the source of the audio, and also brought in the police to investigate whether a crime had been committed.&lt;ref name=20151030ejinsight&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20151030-hku-council-backed-intrusive-investigation-to-find-leaker/|title=HKU council backed 'intrusive investigation' to find leaker|work=EJ Insight|date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent lawyers, however, said that no crime had been committed, and that any attempt to prosecute the leaker would fail. One senior legal academic criticised the council for wasting police resources.&lt;ref name=ejinsight151029&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20151029-police-probing-leaked-recording-of-hku-council-meeting/|title=Police probing leaked recording of HKU council meeting|work=EJ Insight|date=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial Radio (CR) reached an agreement with HKU on 5 November undertaking not to air any other content of the council's past or future meetings unless these had already been reported by other media, meaning compliance with the terms of the interim injunction obtained by the university a few days earlier.&lt;ref name=rthk1221767&gt;{{cite news|title=Commercial Radio, HKU strike deal on audio leaks|url=http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1221767-20151105.htm|work=Radio Television Hong Kong|date=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presiding High Court judge expressed reservations that Leong, on behalf of HKU, was seeking a "perpetual injunction on all meetings, future, past, and present". While CR's lawyer said agreement to comply with the court order did not imply that the station is compromising on press freedom, Hong Kong Journalists Association expressed disappointment at the broadcaster's decision. Pundits suggested that CR was bowing to political pressure as its broadcasting licence was up for renewal next year.&lt;ref name=20151106ejinsight&gt;{{cite news|title=Commercial Radio agrees not to contest HKU gag order|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20151106-commercial-radio-agrees-not-contest-hku-gag-order/|work=Hong Kong Economic Journal|date=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university insisted that the radio broadcaster must disclose the source of the leaked recording, which CR vowed it would never do,&lt;ref name=20151106hongkongfp&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheung|first1=Karen|title=HKU injunction on leaked tapes to continue as radio station vows never to reveal source|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/11/06/hku-injunction-on-leaked-tapes-to-continue-as-radio-station-vows-never-to-reveal-source/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a legal expert noted that privacy was not on equal footing with the freedom of information, and that legislation protecting whistleblowers was lacking in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=20151105ejinsight&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moir|first1=Jane|title=Privacy rights vs freedom of information: Which comes first?|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20151105-privacy-rights-versus-freedom-of-information/|work=Hong Kong Economic Journal|date=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a court hearing on 6 November, the court extended the injunction to 24 November, but reduced its scope. It covers "persons unknown" who possess information about the five HKU council meetings held between June and October only. While HKU sought to adjourn the case, other interested parties – a legislator the HK Journalists Association, ''Apple Daily'', and two HKU law student (one of whom being chief editor of HKU student magazine ''Undergrad'') – joined the case seeking to have it dismissed outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ng|first1=Joyce|title=Leaks 'in the public domain': Hong Kong court extends HKU gag order but it no longer covers future meetings|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/1876250/leaks-public-domain-hong-kong-court-extends-hku-gag-order|work=South China Morning Post|date=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blanket protection for future council meetings no longer applied.

== Reaction ==
[[File:HKU academic freedom protest 2015-10-09.JPG|thumbnail|Students and faculty convene at Sun Yat-sen Place on the evening of 9 October]]
After the decision, Johannes Chan said that as a statutory publicly funded body, the council should act in an open and transparent manner and confirmed that he thought that his rejection was politically motivated.&lt;ref name=swinging/&gt; He stated, "This is not an issue of personal gain or loss, but one about the core values of academic freedom and institutional autonomy."&lt;ref name=scmpfinalvote/&gt;

=== Students and scholars ===
Other key international public law scholars came to Chan's defence. [[Yash Ghai]] stated that "as a long-serving member of HKU [...] it grieves me greatly to see the council turn to these nasty tricks to deny [Chan the job] in order to – one must assume – appease the Chinese government".&lt;ref name=swinging&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zhao|first1=Shirley|last2=Ng|first2=Joyce|last3=Au Yeung|first3=Alan|title=Going down swinging: University of Hong Kong's Johannes Chan decries political interference and wants reasons after appointment defeat|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/1862650/going-down-swinging-university-hong-kongs|work=South China Morning Post|date=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome A. Cohen]] compared the vote to a [[Mao Zedong|Mao]]-era political tactic and called the decision "very sad news for Hong Kong's autonomy and freedom".&lt;ref name=nytimes11/&gt; [[Roderick MacFarquhar]] called the vote an example of the [[Chinese government]]'s push under [[Xi Jinping]], current [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]], to eradicate so-called Western values.&lt;ref name=nytimes11/&gt;

The Hong Kong University Students' Union called the decision unjust and unfair, and demanded an explanation from the council members who voted against Chan's appointment.&lt;ref name=hkfpexplainer/&gt; The [[Hong Kong Federation of Students]] stated that "the Hong Kong Communist administration has brazenly invaded Hong Kong's higher education, [and] political suppression of academia is now a fact".&lt;ref name=hkfpexplainer/&gt; Education lawmaker [[Ip Kin-yuen]] said "It's obvious that the decision was a political one [...] Academic freedom will no longer exist after this" and "Today is the saddest day in the University of Hong Kong's 100 years of history."&lt;ref name=scmpfinalvote/&gt;&lt;ref name=ibtimes/&gt; Others noted that the decision would serve as a warning to other academics not to engage in pro-democratic politics, and would severely tarnish Hong Kong's reputation for academic freedom and educational excellence.&lt;ref name=voa1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ibtimes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tejas|first1=Aditya|title=Johannes Chan Blocked From Hong Kong University Post, Raising Academic Freedom Concerns|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/johannes-chan-blocked-hong-kong-university-post-raising-academic-freedom-concerns-2120232|work=International Business Times|date=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law faculty released a rare statement defending Chan against the council members who said he was not suitable for the post. The statement said that the accusations levelled against Chan were groundless, and that "[The faculty] refutes in the strongest possible terms unfair criticisms that were said to have been made [...] Chan is internationally recognised as a leading scholar in his field. He was appointed dean of law for his vision, his leadership, his integrity, his passion for legal education, and above all his outstanding abilities.

On 8 October 2015, academics from across Hong Kong's tertiary education sector convened to form a new group to defend [[academic freedom]] called Scholars' Alliance for Academic Freedom (SAAF). The group stated, "academic freedom can only exist through perpetual awareness, insistence and collective work".&lt;ref name=afp9oct&gt;{{cite news|title=HKU students, alumni and teachers protest over academic freedom as anger mounts|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/10/09/hku-students-alumni-and-teachers-protest-over-academic-freedom-as-anger-mounts/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In elections to elect three full-time teaching members of its governing Council to replace those retiring in December, Head of the School of Humanities Timothy O'Leary, politics professor Joseph Chan and Mechanical engineering professor Cheung Kie-chung topped the poll with 322, 328 and 183 votes respectively.

=== Doctorate degree issue ===
Numerous academics have rebuked the repeated attacks in pro-government media against Chan's lack of a doctorate degree, a point that Billy Fung says was cited by Arthur Li and Edward Chen as a primary reason for not appointing Chan.&lt;ref name=smeared&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lian|first1=Joseph Yizheng|title=How Johannes Chan is being preposterously smeared|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20151006-how-johannes-chan-is-being-preposterously-smeared/|work=Hong Kong Economic Journal|date=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Lian Yizheng, prominent former member of the [[Central Policy Unit]], noted that no incumbent law school dean in Hong Kong has a doctoral degree, nor do numerous deans of top international law schools.&lt;ref name=smeared/&gt; He wrote that such a requirement is "irrelevant" in the law profession, and alleged that many of those on the HKU council who head academic departments yet do not hold PhDs were being hypocritical.&lt;ref name=smeared/&gt; Sing Ming, a professor at the [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]], echoed the observation that a lack of a PhD is not unusual among heads of law schools internationally.&lt;ref name=meddling/&gt; [[Chinese University of Hong Kong|Chinese University]] international relations professor Simon Shen wrote that it was "ridiculous" to require a doctoral degree for the post, citing the case of celebrated Chinese historian and educator [[Ch'ien Mu]], who had only a junior high education.&lt;ref name=necessary&gt;{{cite news|title=Is a doctorate degree necessary for a pro vice chancellor?|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20151002-is-a-doctorate-degree-necessary-for-a-pro-vice-chancellor/|work=[[Hong Kong Economic Journal]]|date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ming Pao]] Daily'' noted that only four out of six current or former Hong Kong pro-vice-chancellors since 2013 hold doctorate degrees.&lt;ref name=necessary/&gt; Chan himself says that he began study for a doctoral degree in 1988 at the [[London School of Economics]], but dropped out because he wanted to help Hong Kong people understand legal issues during the complicated run-up to the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|1997 transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name=necessary/&gt;

=== Demonstrations ===
On 6 October 2015, up to 2,000 faculty and students donned black dress and held a [[walkout]], marching in silent protest through the university campus.&lt;ref name=aus1007&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murdoch|first1=Scott|title=Walkouts at Hong Kong Uni after academic is snubbed for top job|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/walkouts-at-hong-kong-uni-after-academic-is-snubbed-for-top-job/story-e6frgcjx-1227559411644|work=The Australian|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banners appeared around the campus reading, "The institutional autonomy of the University of Hong Kong is under attack."&lt;ref name=aus1007/&gt; Speaking at the protest Timothy O'Leary, head of the Humanities Department, described Chan's non-appointment as "an absolute disgrace", and said "we march in silence to demonstrate to ourselves and to the city of Hong Kong what a university could be like if its academic staff and students were silent."&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|last1=Iyengar|first1=Rishi|title=Academics and Students in Hong Kong Protest Against Interference From China|url=http://time.com/4062330/hong-kong-university-protest-johannes-chan/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Tom|title=Academics and students march in Hong Kong against 'Beijing crackdown'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/06/hong-kong-academics-students-march-beijing-crackdown|work=The Guardian|date=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second protest took place at 9 October 2015 at Sun Yat-sen Place, outside the university library.&lt;ref name=afp9oct/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian1/&gt; It was co-organised by the Students' Union, the HKU Academic Staff Association, the HKU Alumni Concern Group, and 18 professional institutes representing lawyers, accountants, surveyors, information technology workers, nurses, social workers, psychologists, and other professions. The organisers called the council's decision "unprecedented and naked political interference" in university affairs and said that it undermines "Hong Kong values" in demonstrating that hard work and competence may be worthless if you have political views deemed unacceptable by the establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lai|first1=Ying-kit|title=Lawyers, nurses, accountants, IT workers to join HKU students in protest over appointment row|work=South China Morning Post|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== US Congress ===
The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission published its annual report in mid-November drawing attention to declining press and academic freedom in Hong Kong. It specifically mentioned the controversy surrounding the appointment of Chan to pro-vice-chancellor of the university.
 
The HK government retorted that Hong Kong enjoyed a high degree of autonomy under one country, two systems enshrined in the Basic Law, adding that the eight "University Grants Committee-funded institutions were all independent and autonomous statutory bodies". The government warned foreign governments and legislatures that they "should not interfere in any form in Hong Kong's internal affairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheung|first1=Karen|title=Foreign gov'ts warned to 'not interfere' after US report highlights threats to Hong Kong's freedoms|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/11/19/foreign-govts-warned-to-not-interfere-after-us-report-highlights-threats-to-hong-kongs-freedoms/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Widecombe Fair''' is a [[fair]] that takes place annually in the [[Dartmoor]] [[village]] of [[Widecombe-in-the-Moor]], on the second Tuesday in September. It is well known as the subject of the [[folk song]] of the same name, featuring [[Uncle Tom Cobley]] and his friends.

== History ==

The earliest written record was in 1850, when it was described in the [[Plymouth Gazette]] as ‘a cattle fair’. It soon became an opportunity to show and sell other [[livestock]] - particularly locally-bred [[sheep]] and [[Dartmoor pony|Dartmoor ponies]], and by the 1920s it had also become a sports day for local schoolchildren. In 1933, stalls were introduced, selling rural arts and crafts.

Widecombe Fair was suspended during the [[Second World War]], but reinstated in 1945 with new attractions, including a [[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|gymkhana]] and [[tug of war]]. All profits were donated to the 'Local Welcome Home Fund' for returning soldiers, sailors and airmen. 

In 1989, it was decided to cancel the [[pony]] classes following an outbreak of [[Equine influenza|Equine flu]] (these were replaced with [[terrier]] races, which have continued ever since). The Fair was cancelled altogether in 2001 due to the outbreak of [[2001 UK foot and mouth crisis|Foot and Mouth Disease]].

However, despite these interruptions, the event has steadily grown in size and reputation. In its earlier years, it was held in various locations around the village, including the [[village green]]. Today, however, it occupies a large field to the south of Widecombe (known to locals as The Fair Field). Other fields become car parks, and a complex policing and marshalling system is put in place, with the narrow lanes transformed into a one-way road system.

Today's visitors will still see displays of quality livestock, although there are many other attractions, including: a [[dog]] show, displays of local produce, vintage farm machinery, rural arts and crafts, [[bale tossing]] and a now traditional appearance by Uncle Tom Cobley himself - featuring a local resident in [[fancy dress]], riding a grey mare.

==History==

The World Education Games is a major free online educational competition-style event, hosted by the global e-learning provider 3P Learning (creators of subscription-based e-learning platforms designed primarily for schools - such as Mathletics, Spellodrome and IntoScience).

The World Education Games (or WEG) had its origins purely as a mathematics-based event, then known as [[World Maths Day]] in 2007. The event was powered by 3P Learning's flagship online learning resource, Mathletics.

In 2011, the event expanded to include a second subject (World Spelling Day, renamed World Literacy Day in 2013), followed a year later by a third subject (World Science Day) and at which point the event took on the fully encompassing '''World Education Games'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The World Education Games Brings Together 8MM Students From 30,000 Schools in 200 Countries and Challenges Kids in Math, Literacy and Science|url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-world-education-games-brings-together-8mm-students-from-30000-schools-in-200-countries-and-challenges-kids-in-math-literacy-and-science-300145744.html|website = www.prnewswire.com|accessdate = 2015-09-25|first = The World Education|last = Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; name and branding.

Since 2012 The World Education Games has been collaborating with UNICEF&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Support UNICEF|url = http://support.unicef.org/|website = support.unicef.org|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the framework of a program called "School in a Box&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Education Games|url = https://secured.unicef.org.au/Appeal/weg2015|website = secured.unicef.org.au|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;" that supports the development of education in regions that are affected by various disasters and poverty.

== Rules ==
'''Summary:''' Participation in the Games is open to all students from any country and is completely free. Registration is required and an access to the internet is a must. Students are matched according to their age/ grade levels or abilities if such is requested by their teachers. Students play randomly against other students from all over the world. Students answer as many questions as possible during the allotted time for each Game.

Correct answers get points, wrong answers no points and three wrong answers end the game prematurely. Each student plays and scored for the points accumulated during the first 20 games only.

Results are announced after counting all the points and after the organizers had communicated with the parents/ teachers of possible winners and ensured that they had participated in the Games under their own registered accounts. Multiple registrations and/ or playing under someone's else account is a violation punishable by annulling the results of everyone involved.
Winners are the students who score the highest points in their grade level in each competition separately and in total.

Schools are also awarded for receiving the highest point-average in each grade level as long as at least 10 students had participated from that school.

Top 100 participants also get their achievements listed on the Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Education Games 2015|url = http://worldeducationgames.com/WEGRegistration/#/register|website = worldeducationgames.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who win their regional lead-up events in their countries are hand-picked to become Ambassadors.

The building itself is also the oldest still functioning theatre house in Finland. The name means "The Swedish theatre of Åbo"; [[Åbo]] is the Swedish name of the city of Turku.

== History ==
Turku was the capital city of Finland during Finland's epoch as a part of [[Sweden]], and Swedish theatre companies visited Finland during the 18th-century, the first of whom was the [[Stenborg Troupe]] in 1761&lt;ref&gt;Tryggve Byström (1981). Svenska komedien 1737-1754. Borås: Centraltryckeriet AB. {{ISBN|91-1-813241-3}} &lt;/ref&gt;and the company of [[Carl Seuerling]] in the 1780s.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://runeberg.org/nfbh/0175.html 	 	Nordisk familjebok / Uggleupplagan. 8. Feiss - Fruktmögel ]'' &lt;/ref&gt; There where however, no proper theatre building until the ''[[Bonuviers Teater]]'' was erected in the 1810s. When the old theatre was destroyed during the [[Great Fire of Turku]] in 1827, there was a need of a new theater house.  

===1839-1894===
The theatre has been located in its present building since 1839, when it was opened by a local amateur society with the play ''[[Gubben i Bergsbygden]]'' the 21 January 1839.  Later that same year, the theatre house was used by its first professional theatre company, that of [[Ulrik Torsslow]], and its first professional concert singer, [[Betty Boije]].&lt;ref&gt;Gustaf Cygnaeus, ''[https://archive.org/stream/boteater00cygngoog/boteater00cygngoog_djvu.txt  Åbo teater, 1839-1889]''&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1843, concerts by [[Johanna von Schoultz]] and [[Jenny Lind]] where both performed on its stage.&lt;ref&gt;Gustaf Cygnaeus, ''[https://archive.org/stream/boteater00cygngoog/boteater00cygngoog_djvu.txt  Åbo teater, 1839-1889]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to 1894, the theatre did not have a permanent staff, as Finland did not have any native actors at this point, and during the 19th-century the theatre house was used by travelling theatre companies from Sweden. The most notable of these where the company of [[Pierre Deland]], which visited the theatre regularly from 1840 to 1861, as well as the so called "Finnish Company" of [[Edvard Stjernström]], which enjoyed theatre monopoly in Southern Finland in 1850-53.&lt;ref&gt;Gustaf Cygnaeus, ''[https://archive.org/stream/boteater00cygngoog/boteater00cygngoog_djvu.txt  Åbo teater, 1839-1889]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1870s and 1880s, the famed Swedish company of [[Thérèse Elfforss]] frequnelty visited the theatre. &lt;ref&gt;Gustaf Cygnaeus, ''[https://archive.org/stream/boteater00cygngoog/boteater00cygngoog_djvu.txt  Åbo teater, 1839-1889]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The first native theatre company performed in the theatre was the company of [[August Westermark]] in 1872, though it was not to be until 1894, that the first performance was given by a permanent native ensemble at the theatre.
