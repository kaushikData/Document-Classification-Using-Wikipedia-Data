'''{{mp|(172034) 2001 WR|1}}''', provisional designation ''{{mp|2001 WR|1}}'', is a sub-kilometer [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Amor asteroid|Amor group]], approximately {{convert|650|m|ft|abbr=off|sigfig=2|sp=us}} in diameter. The [[S-type asteroid]] has been identified as a potential flyby target of the ''[[Hayabusa2]]'' mission.&lt;ref name="Sarli-2017" /&gt; It was discovered on 17 November 2001, by astronomers with the [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] at the [[Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site]] near Socorro, New Mexico, in the United States.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; The asteroid has a [[rotation period]] of 8.0 hours and possibly an elongated shape.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt; It remains unnamed since its [[Minor planet designation|numbering]] in December 2007.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

''{{mp|2001 WR|1}}'' is an [[Amor asteroid]] – a subgroup of near-Earth asteroids that approach the orbit of Earth from beyond, but do not cross it. The object orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.02–1.54&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 17 months (527 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 1.28&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.20 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 25[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The body's [[observation arc]] begins with its first observation in February 1953, more than 48 years prior to its official discovery observation at Socorro. The [[precovery]] was taken at [[Palomar Observatory]] and published by the [[Digitized Sky Survey]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

=== Close encounters ===

''{{mp|2001 WR|1}}'' has an Earth [[minimum orbital intersection distance]] of {{convert |0.0747 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3}} which corresponds to 29.1 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; In September 1926, it approached Earth to {{convert |0.1496 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3}}, its closest approach of all close encounters since 1900. Only in September 2199, it will approach Earth at a similar distance of {{convert |0.1514 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3}}.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== ''Hayabusa2'' mission ==

''{{mp|2001 WR|1}}'' is currently the prime target of the ''[[Hayabusa2]]'' mission for a [[Planetary flyby|flyby]] planned to occur on 27 June 2023.&lt;ref name="Sarli-2017" /&gt; When the spacecraft returns to Earth and delivers the sample capsule in December 2020, it is expected to retain 30&amp;nbsp;kg of [[xenon]] propellant, which can be used to extend its service and flyby new targets to explore.&lt;ref name="Sarli-2017" /&gt;

== Numbering and naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was [[Minor planet designation|numbered]] by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 24 December 2007 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 61443}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt; As of 2018, it has not been [[List of named minor planets (numerical)|named]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

''{{mp|2001 WR|1}}'' has been characterized as a common, stony [[S-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name="Carry-2016" /&gt;

=== Rotation period ===

In March 2018, a rotational [[lightcurve]] of ''{{mp|2001 WR|1}}'' was obtained from [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] observations by [[Brian D. Warner|Brian Warner]] at the Palmer Divide Station {{Obscode|U82}} in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a [[rotation period]] of {{val|8.0475|0.0003}} hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.95 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=3]]}}), indicative of a non-spherical shape.&lt;ref name="Warner-2018h" /&gt;{{efn|name=lightcurveplot-Warner}}

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by the [[NEOWISE]] mission of NASA's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]], ''{{mp|2001 WR|1}}'' has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.34 and measures 0.63 and 0.66 kilometers in diameter, respectively.&lt;ref name="Mainzer-2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nugent-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nugent-2016" /&gt; The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes a standard albedo for a stony asteroid of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 0.818 kilometers based on an [[absolute magnitude]] of 17.8.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

On 18 December 1963 a number of students from [[Ghana]] and other African countries organized a protest on [[Moscow]]'s [[Red Square]] in response to the alleged murder of medical student Edmund Assare-Addo. The number of participants was reported at 500–700,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1963/12/19/page/4/article/500-african-students-riot-in-red-square|title=500 AFRICAN STUDENTS RIOT IN RED SQUARE|date=December 19, 1963|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DI"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&amp;d=DIL19631221.2.11#| title = Russia Issues Warning|publisher =''[[Daily Illini]]''|date=21 December 1963| accessdate =15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cairn"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.cairn.info/zen.php?ID_ARTICLE=CMR_471_0033| title =Death of an African Student in Moscow|publisher =CAIRN.info|author=Julie Hessler| accessdate =15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but according to the Ghanaian physician Edward Na, who participated in the events, there were at most 150 protesters.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/russian/russia/2010/02/100204_peoples_friendship_lumumba.shtml| script-title=ru:Они учились в СССР |author=Лина Розовская|publisher =[[BBC]]|language=Russian| accessdate =15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ambassador of Ghana in the [[Soviet Union]] [[John Banks Elliott]] requested a [[militsiya]] protection of the Ghanaian embassy.&lt;ref name="DI"/&gt;

This was the first recorded political protest on Red Square since the late 1920s.&lt;ref name="cairn"/&gt;

==Background==
Edmund Assare-Addo was a 29-year-old student of the Kalinin Medical Institute. His body was found in a stretch of wasteland along a country road leading to the [[Moscow Ring Road]].&lt;ref name="cairn"/&gt; African students alleged that he was knifed&lt;ref name="DI"/&gt; by a Soviet man because Assare-Addo courted a Russian girl.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The African students based their allegation on the unlikelihood of a student venturing into that remote place.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The Soviet authorities stated that Assare-Addo froze to death in a snow while being drunk. According to the [[autopsy]], performed by Soviet medics with two advanced medical students from Ghana as observers, the death was "an effect of cold in a state of alcohol-induced [[stupor]]".&lt;ref name="cairn"/&gt; No signs of physical trauma were found, with the possible exception of a small scar on the neck.&lt;ref name="cairn"/&gt;

Discussing the incident&lt;!--the death, or the protest?--&gt; with Soviet officials, Elliot indicated the Western embassies in Moscow ("the U.S., England, France, the FRG, or even Holland") as the probable instigators of the incident.&lt;ref name="cairn"/&gt; Elliot went so far as to suggest that students who "behaved poorly" and "skipped class" should be expelled from the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="cairn"/&gt; Before the students' march to the Red Square Elliott alleged that the students broke into the Ghanaian embassy and damaged furniture and pictures.&lt;ref name="DI"/&gt;

==Protest==
{{wikisource|Memorandum to the Soviet Government from African Students in the Soviet Union}}
The protesters were African students studying in Soviet universities and institutes. Having assembled on the morning of 18 December 1963, they wrote a memorandum to present to Soviet authorities. The protesters carried placards with slogans "Moscow – center of discrimination", "Stop killing Africans!" and "Moscow, a second [[Alabama]]", while shouting in English, Russian, and French.&lt;ref name="cairn"/&gt; The protesters marched to the [[Spasskaya Tower|Spasskiye Gates]] of the [[Kremlin]], where they posed for photographs and gave interviews to the Western correspondents.&lt;ref name="cairn"/&gt; The Soviet [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] news agency responded with a statement: "It is to be regretted that the meetings of the Ghanaian students which began in connection with their claims to the embassy of their country resulted in the disturbance of public order in Moscow streets. It is quite natural that this is resented by the Russian people".&lt;ref name="DI"/&gt;

On 20 December, the students returned to classes and militsiya ceased the protection of the Ghanaian embassy.&lt;ref name="DI"/&gt;

{{Anti-austerity movement in the European Union}}
The '''anti-austerity movement in [[Greece]]''' involves a series of demonstrations and [[general strike]]s that took place across the country. The events, which began on 5 May 2010, were provoked by plans to cut public spending and raise taxes as [[austerity measure]]s in exchange for a {{Nowrap|€110 billion}} bail-out, aimed at solving the [[Greek government-debt crisis]]. Three people were killed on 5 May in one of the largest demonstrations in Greece [[Athens Polytechnic Uprising|since 1973]].

On {{Start date|2011|5|25|df=y}}, anti-austerity activists organised by the [[Direct Democracy Now!]] movement, known as the '''Indignant Citizens Movement''' ({{lang-el|Κίνημα Αγανακτισμένων Πολιτών}}, ''Kínima Aganaktisménon-Politón''), started demonstrating in major cities across Greece.

==Background of the 2010 events==
{{Greek economic crisis}}
{{further|Greek government-debt crisis|Economy of Greece#2010–2017 government debt crisis}}

In the early to mid-2000s, the government took advantage of Greece's strong economy by running a large deficit. As the world economy cooled in the late 2000s, Greece was hit hard because its main industries—[[Greek Merchant Navy|shipping]] and [[tourism in Greece|tourism]]—were sensitive to changes in the business cycle. As a result, the country's debt began to pile up rapidly. In early 2010 policy makers{{who|date=November 2011}} suggested that emergency bailouts might be necessary.

On 5 March 2010, the [[Hellenic Parliament]] passed the cost-cutting Economy Protection Bill. On 23 April, the Greek government requested that a bailout package offered by the [[European Union]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] be activated.&lt;ref name="bailout request"/&gt; The funds were expected to be available quickly, but it was unclear if they would be activated before a crucial 19 May debt rollover. On 27 April, [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] cut the country's main debt rating to BB+ ("junk" status), increasing concern that a [[Default (finance)|default]] might occur.&lt;ref name=nyt04282010&gt;{{cite news|title= Cuts to Debt Rating Stir Anxiety in Europe |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/business/global/28drachma.html |work=The New York Times |author=Jack Ewing and Jack Healy |date=27 April 2010|accessdate=6 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100503034602/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/business/global/28drachma.html| archivedate= 3 May 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/markets/sp-downgrades-greek-debt-to-junk/story-e6frg91o-1225859110788 |title= S&amp;P downgrades Greek debt to junk |author=Katie Martin and Terence Roth |publisher=Dow Jones Newswires |date=28 April 2010|accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austerity measures===
On 1 May, Prime Minister [[George Papandreou (junior)|George Papandreou]] announced a [[Third austerity package (Greece)|fourth round of austerity measures]] by the Greek government, described as "unprecedented".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/09/greece-debt-crisis-euro-imf |title= The Greek spirit of resistance turns its guns on the IMF |author=Helena Smith |date=9 May 2010|accessdate=10 May 2010|work=The Guardian |location=UK | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100510014536/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/09/greece-debt-crisis-euro-imf| archivedate= 10 May 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include more public sector pay cuts, pension reductions, new taxes on company profits, an increase on luxury and [[sin tax]]es, and an increase of the [[value added tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8655711.stm|title=Greece police tear gas anti-austerity protesters|date=1 May 2010|publisher=BBC News  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gr/news/article.asp?lngEntityID=1132263&amp;lngDtrID=251|title=Fourth raft of new measures|language=Greek|publisher=[[In.gr]] |date=2 May 2010|accessdate=5 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100505125922/http://www.in.gr/news/article.asp?lngEntityID=1132263&amp;lngDtrID=251| archivedate= 5 May 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed changes, which aim to save {{Nowrap|€30 billion}} through 2012, represent the biggest government overhaul within a single generation.&lt;ref name="NY Times protest" /&gt; The cuts are in line with the EU-[[International Monetary Fund]] loan proposals, which demand that Greece liberalise its economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ametroepeia.pblogs.gr/2011/11/o-kybos-errifthh-alea-jacta-est-and-shit-has-hit-the-fan.html|title=wrath of the People|publisher=Mike Kamateros}}&lt;/ref&gt; They helped Greece reach a loan agreement, announced on 2 May, for an immediate {{Nowrap|€45 billion}} in loans (with a 5% interest for the most part, provided by the EU), with additional funds available in the future.&lt;ref name="NY Times protest" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Greece Accepts Terms of EU-Led Bailout, 'Savage' Cuts (Update2)&amp;nbsp;– Bloomberg.com | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a9f8X9yDMcdI&amp;pos=1 | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=3 May 2010|accessdate=7 May 2010|author=Flavia Krause-Jackson and Gabi Thesing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = EU puts positive spin on Greek rescue|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/08a87e4e-55c4-11df-b835-00144feab49a.html|work=Financial Times|date=2 May 2010|accessdate=2 May 2010|first=Kerin|last=Hope| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100504203836/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/08a87e4e-55c4-11df-b835-00144feab49a.html| archivedate= 4 May 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="businessweek20100305"/&gt; The total value of the loans was expected to be in the {{Nowrap|€110 billion}} range.&lt;ref name="BBC protest" /&gt; Papandreou submitted the bill to Parliament on 4 May.&lt;ref name="ABC protest" /&gt;

===Relationship to the 2008 Greek riots===

The [[2008 Greek riots]] started on 6 December 2008, when Alexandros Grigoropoulos ({{lang-el|Αλέξανδρος Γρηγορόπουλος}}), a 15-year-old student, was killed by two policemen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100033_13/06/2009_108067|title=POLICE TRIAL Two indicted over teen shooting |publisher=Kathimerini}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Exarcheia]] district of central [[Athens]].

==2010 protests==

===Before 5 May 2010===
On May Day, there were protest marches in [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]], by many unions, left-wing, anarchist and communist party supporters. Violent clashes broke out when riot police were sent out to contain the protestors.&lt;ref name="BBC may day rallies"/&gt;&lt;!-- strikes by unions, civil servants, and teachers also took place before 5 May. --&gt;

On 4 May, members of the [[Communist Party of Greece]] broke into the [[Acropolis of Athens]] and hung banners: "Peoples of Europe Rise Up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews/ynews_wl1925|title=In Photos: Greek protesters storm the Acropolis|publisher=[[Yahoo! News]]|date=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===5 May 2010 strike and demonstrations===

In response to the proposed spending cuts and tax increases, a nationwide strike was called for 5 May. Starting at midnight, aeroplane, train, and ferry traffic in and out of the country ceased.&lt;ref name="BBC protest" /&gt; Schools, some hospitals, and many private businesses were closed.&lt;ref name="BBC protest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC protest" /&gt; The demonstrations are seen by some as the most widespread since the end of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]].&lt;ref name=burns &gt;{{cite news|title= Greek bailout: Athens burns – and crisis strikes at heart of the EU |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/05/greek-bailout-economic-crisis-deaths |author=Helena Smith |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=5 May 2010|accessdate=7 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100506032545/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/05/greek-bailout-economic-crisis-deaths| archivedate= 6 May 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 100,000 people marched through Athens,&lt;ref name="ABC protest" /&gt;&lt;ref name=burns /&gt; with some estimates stretching to 500,000.&lt;ref name="turnout 5 may rallies"/&gt; As protests gained momentum, a large group tried to storm the parliament building in [[Syntagma Square]] in Athens, where they scuffled with police, causing some of the [[Presidential Guard (Greece)|Presidential Guard]] to flee from the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]].&lt;ref name=burns /&gt; The protesters accused members of parliament of being "thieves".&lt;ref name="BBC protest" /&gt; Riot police were able to push the crowds back with [[tear gas]], [[flash bomb]]s and [[smoke bomb]]s.&lt;ref name="ABC protest" /&gt; Nearby buildings, including a finance ministry building, were set on fire.&lt;ref name="BBC protest" /&gt; Prime Minister George Papandreou responded "Nobody has the right to violence and particularly violence that leads to murder. Violence breeds violence."&lt;ref name="BBC protest" /&gt;

[[File:Outside MARFIN bank.png|thumb|People paying their respects to the memory of the people who died on 5 May.]]
Protesters set fire to a [[Marfin Investment Group|Marfin Bank]] branch on [[Stadiou Street]] with [[Molotov cocktail]]s; witnesses said that protestors marching past the bank ignored the employees' cries for help, while others chanted [[anti-capitalist]] slogans.&lt;ref name="BBC protest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC protest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kathimerini protest"/&gt; Most of the bank's employees managed to escape the burning building, but two employees who jumped from the second-story balcony were injured and two women and a man were found dead after the fire was extinguished.&lt;ref name="Kerdos protest"/&gt; It was reported that fire crews had difficulty reaching the scene because of demonstrations moving through the area.&lt;ref name="Kathimerini protest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs newshour interview"/&gt; The victims died of [[asphyxiation]] from toxic fumes when they were unable to escape from a roof exit that was blocked.

Police started a widespread search, with the help of closed-circuit television footage to detect and arrest the suspects. The police blamed "hooded youth" for the incident,&lt;ref name="ABC protest" /&gt; while one protestor who spoke to BBC blamed police brutality for the escalation of violence which was started when protestors threw [[Molotov cocktail]]s at police; the police responded with pepper spray and tear gas.&lt;ref name="BBC protest" /&gt; In response to the incident, the [[Greek Federation of Bank Employees' Unions]] blamed bank management for inadequate safety measures in the building and called for strike action.&lt;ref name="bank employees strike"/&gt;

Also on 5 May, the German parliament began debating the bailout package, as Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] urged rapid passage.&lt;ref name="BBC protest" /&gt; Merkel remarked that "Quite simply, Europe's future is at stake."&lt;ref name="BBC protest" /&gt; The plan requires Germany to provide the largest share, {{Nowrap|€22 billion}}, of the bailout funds.&lt;ref name="BBC protest" /&gt; The plan must be approved by 15 [[Eurozone]] countries in total.&lt;ref name="BBC protest" /&gt;

Analysts said the protests could mark the beginning of protracted [[social unrest]].&lt;ref name="NY Times protest" /&gt; If that occurs, the country could be pushed into deep recession.&lt;ref name="NY Times protest" /&gt; Economists have warned that it could be ten years before the Greek economy recovers, even if it does not worsen first.&lt;ref name="NY Times protest" /&gt;

There has been advocacy for a [[political coalition]] from within the Greek political elite, and by the Greek journalist [[Alexis Papahelas]] who said that Papandreou should 'get rid of some of the novices he has in his government, make an overture to the opposition and go full-steam ahead.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_100006_06/05/2010_116895|title=Which path will we take?|publisher=[[Kathimerini]]|first=Alexis|last=Papachelas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One columnist at [[The Guardian]] suggested in an editorial that the protests speak of a deeper issue in Greek politics: she asks, 'What the advocates of this scenario [coalition government] do not seem to grasp is that the political class is out of touch with the population,' and 'How can we expect to see solutions and progress by the very same people who are inextricably, causally linked to the problem?'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/06/national-unity-greece-crisis|title=Greek debt crisis: coalition won't solve anything|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=6 May 2010|first=Matina|last=Stevis }}&lt;/ref&gt; However other sources&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/22936994/Beyond_Spontaneity|title=Beyond Spontaneity|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the movement was a positive reaction triggering a series of innovative socio-political processes.

==Background of the 2011 protests==

The memorandum signed between Greece and the IMF became largely unpopular in Greece, with some polls showing that 62% believe it was a bad decision. This memorandum came into action 7 October 2011.&lt;ref name="Public Issue"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mνημόνιο ένα χρόνο μετά: Aποδοκιμασία, αγανάκτηση, απαξίωση, ανασφάλεια |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/169875/mnimonio-ena-hrono-meta-apodokimasia-aganaktisi-apaxiosi-anasfaleia/ |publisher=skai.gr |accessdate=18 May 2011|date=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid accusations that the government has not achieved its goals according to the IMF memorandum, some countries in the [[European Union]] have stated that they will not be lending Greece any more money if the IMF does not do so, including the Netherlands, Germany and Sweden.&lt;ref name="Skai 29 3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Σκληρή γραμμή έναντι της Αθήνας από τους Ολλανδούς |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/finance/article/170745/skliri-grammi-enadi-tis-athinas-apo-tous-ollandous-/ |publisher=skai.gr |accessdate=29 May 2011|date=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skai 28 3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ενέχυρο κρατική περιουσία θέλουν Γερμανία, Φινλανδία και Ολλανδία |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/finance/article/170713/enehuro-kratiki-periousia-theloun-germania-finlandia-kai-ollandia-/ |publisher=skai.gr |accessdate=29 May 2011|date=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some European officials went so far as to say that Greece should start selling its assets to other European nations to receive loans, and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] Minister of Finance said that the Greek parliament would not like this proposal and characterised the opinion of the Greek parliament as "a sensibility" that no one can consider at this time.&lt;ref name="Skai 28 3" /&gt; Meanwhile, unemployment exceeded 15%, while a large percentage of full-time workers only received the minimum wage of 592 Euros, or less.&lt;ref name="in.gr minimum wage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Την ελάχιστη αμοιβή παίρνει το 25% των εργαζομένων- Ακάλυπτοι από το νόμο οι άνεργοι |url=http://news.in.gr/economy/article/?aid=1231110553 |publisher=in.gr |accessdate=31 May 2011|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imerisia unemployment"&gt;{{cite web|title=Στο 15,9% η ανεργία το Φεβρουάριο |url=http://www.imerisia.gr/article.asp?catid=12336&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=111171174 |publisher=imerisia.gr |accessdate=31 May 2011|date=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumours suggesting Greece's future exclusion from the [[Eurozone]] also added to frustration, but these were categorically rejected by the Greek government, the [[European Central Bank]], the [[Bank of Greece]] and IMF-director nominee, and French Finance Minister, [[Christine Lagarde]].&lt;ref name="Skai 29 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Λαγκάρντ: Η αλληλεγγύη αντίστοιχη με τις ελληνικές προσπάθειες |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/finance/article/170752/papadimos-i-katastasi-tis-oikonomias-epideinothike-/ |publisher=skai.gr |accessdate=29 May 2011|date=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skai 27 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Προβόπουλος: Παντελώς γελοία τα περί εξόδου από το ευρώ |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/finance/article/170661/provopoulos-padelos-geloia-ta-peri-exodou-apo-to-euro-/ |publisher=skai.gr |accessdate=29 May 2011|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 June 2011, amid violent protests, the second austerity package was passed with 155 votes in favour in the 300-seat parliament. The next day, the Office of the [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]] of the United Nations reported an independent UN expert's warning that the austerity measures could result in violations of the Greek people's human rights, such as "rights to food, water, adequate housing and work under fair and equitable conditions".&lt;ref name="UN human rights"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38901&amp;Cr=austerity&amp;Cr1= |title=Greek austerity measures could violate human rights, UN expert says |date=30 June 2011|publisher=United Nations |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, other international media have questioned the necessity of a second austerity package, when the first one brought in no results.&lt;ref name="The Guardian austerity"&gt;{{cite news|title=Greece and austerity: Brussels v the people |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/29/greece-austerity-brussels-people?intcmp=239 |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=4 July 2011|date=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Greece signed the Memorandum with the European Union and the IMF in 2010, the matter of the constitutional legality of the memorandum came under criticism in Greece, both by the people and some of the country's most prominent university professors of law.&lt;ref name="Eleftherotypia constitution 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Και "Αρμα" κατά του Μνημονίου |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.article&amp;id=267498 |publisher=enet.gr |accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eleftherotypia constitution 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ανάλυση στα γεγονότα |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=issue.el.home&amp;date=15/04/2011&amp;s=analysh-sta-gegonota |publisher=enet.gr |accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Athens Association of Lawyers, as well as a number of labour unions, brought the question of the legality of the memorandum to the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] of the Greek government, but the Council judged the contract to be constitutional in late June 2011.&lt;ref name="Proto Thema mnimonio"&gt;{{cite web|title="Mάχη" για την συνταγματικότητα του μνημονίου |url=http://www.protothema.gr/greece/article/?aid=88822 |publisher=protothema.gr |accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Council of State"&gt;{{cite web|title=ΣτΕ: Συνταγματικό το Μνημόνιο |url=http://portal.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_kathbreak_1_21/06/2011_395425 |publisher=kathimerini.gr |accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the economic crisis, there is also a developing political crisis in the country.

On 28 June 2011, Greek unions, including those whose members dominate the country's health, transportation, education, and government jobs began a 48-hour strike, in protest of the deteriorating economic situation and suggestions on the part of the government of new austerity measures.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/greek-unions-launch-48-hour-strike-against-austerity-measures-1.370020 |title=Greek unions launch 48-hour strike against austerity measures |date=28 June 2011|work=Haaretz |location=Israel |accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The walkout led to the freezing of a number of public services.&lt;ref name="Haaretz" /&gt; Journalists and a number of artists also stopped working in solidarity with the protest.&lt;ref name="Haaretz" /&gt; That day demonstrations turned violent as protestors clashed with police in front of the Greek parliament and other areas of central [[Athens]].&lt;ref name="Skai Entasi" /&gt; Violence continued during the night and on 29 June, the day when a new package of deeply unpopular austerity measures was passed.&lt;ref name="BBC Greece crisis"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13953077 |title=Greece crisis: Greece crisis: MPs vote on austerity package |accessdate=29 June 2011|work=BBC News |date=29 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629112143/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13953077| archivedate= 29 June 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of Greece's most famous hotels located on Syntagma Square were forced to evacuate their guests and personnel in view of the uncontrollable situation, something that the media say has not happened since the [[Dekemvriana|events of December 1944]], which started the [[Greek Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Skai 30 June" /&gt;

Meanwhile, in [[Thessaloniki]], a crowd of people had blocked a number of important political and religious figures from exiting the grounds of the [[Papafeio|Papafeio Orphanage]], including Minister of Health [[Andreas Loverdos]] and the metropolitan bishop of Thessaloniki, Anthimus.&lt;ref name="Makedonia papafeio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://makthes.gr/news/reportage/76226/ |script-title=el:Αγανακτισμένο μπλόκο στο Παπάφειο |accessdate=29 June 2011|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crowds demanded that the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] help Greece in this time of crisis and accused the clergy of receiving oversized salaries.&lt;ref name="Makedonia papafeio" /&gt; When protesters asked the metropolitan bishop how much his religious attire costs, he replied "not much, it's fake".&lt;ref name="Makedonia papafeio" /&gt; They were forced to exit the grounds through the back door with the aid of the police, using police cars and taxis, while Anthimus left on foot.&lt;ref name="Makedonia papafeio" /&gt;

Despite the violent protests and use of tear gas by police to evacuate Syntagma Square the previous evening, peaceful protests continued on 30 June with thousands of people gathered in front of the Greek parliament.&lt;ref name="Skai 30 June" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Agelioforos 30 June"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agelioforos.gr/default.asp?pid=7&amp;ct=1&amp;artid=100228 |script-title=el:Επιστρέφουν στην Πλατεία Συντάγματος οι Αγανακτισμένοι για να εμποδίσουν την ψήφιση του βασικού εφαρμοστικού νόμου |accessdate=30 June 2011 |language=Greek |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005083720/http://www.agelioforos.gr/default.asp?pid=7&amp;ct=1&amp;artid=100228 |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations also took place in Greece's second city, [[Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref name="Agelioforos 30 June 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agelioforos.gr/default.asp?pid=7&amp;ct=1&amp;artid=100259 |script-title=el:Θεσσαλονίκη: Σήμερα στις 19:00 οι Αγανακτισμένοι στο Λευκό Πύργο ανασυγκροτούνται |accessdate=30 June 2011|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====July====
Protests across the country continued in July, marking 5 weeks and 2 days of protest on 1 July. Despite the fact that the austerity measures had been passed, a large crowd, but smaller than on previous days, gathered in front of the Greek parliament to protest peacefully on 2 July.&lt;ref name="Skai 2 July"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/greece/article/173863/pistoi-sto-radevou-tous-oi-aganaktismenoi/ |script-title=el:Πιστοί στο ραντεβού τους οι "Αγανακτισμένοι" |accessdate=3 July 2011|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====August====
The sit-in at [[Thessaloniki]]'s [[White Tower of Thessaloniki|White Tower]] Square held throughout July and early August, until the municipal police evacuated the square of all protesters that had camped inside on 7 August 2011.&lt;ref name="Proto Thema 7 Avgoustou" /&gt; The police said that the protesters were in violation of various archaeological and environmental provisions,&lt;ref name="Proto Thema 7 Avgoustou" /&gt; while also making seven arrests.&lt;ref name="Proto Thema 7 Avgoustou" /&gt;

On 14 August 2011, the indignant protesters at [[Heraklion]]'s Eleftherias Square agreed to leave the square peacefully,&lt;ref name="Skai 14 August"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/greece/article/177319/xilothike-kai-to-kioski-ton-aganaktismenon-tis-kritis-/ |script-title=el:Ξηλώθηκε και το κιόσκι των "Αγανακτισμένων" της Κρήτης |accessdate=23 August 2011|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the intervention of a local prosecutor;&lt;ref name="Skai 14 August" /&gt; the prosecutor had warned that unless the demonstrators evacuate the square, force would be used, like in Athens.&lt;ref name="Skai 14 August" /&gt; Following the evacuation of the square by the protesters, police cleared the square of the kiosk that the demonstrators had set up.&lt;ref name="Skai 14 August" /&gt;

====Political reactions====
In an interview for the Greek newspaper ''Ethnos'' on 29 May 2011, the vice-president of the [[Government of Greece|Greek government]], Theodoros Pangalos, against whom various slogans had been shouted during the demonstrations, adopted an ironic stance towards the movement. He said that "the formation of a political movement, however much the people who follow the technological trends don't want to hear this, does not depend on how many 'likes' or 'dislikes' it gets on Facebook".&lt;ref name="Ethnos 29"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22767&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=63097052 |script-title=el:Επιστροφή στη δραχμή θέλουν οι μαυραγορίτες |language=Greek |date=29 May 2011|publisher=ethnos.gr |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skai 29"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/170747/theodoros-pagalos-kata-aganaktismenon-/ |script-title=el:Θεόδωρος Πάγκαλος κατά "Αγανακτισμένων" |language=Greek |date=29 May 2011|publisher=skai.gr |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Proto Thema 29"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protothema.gr/greece/article/?aid=124924 |script-title=el:Μόδα των  τεχνολογιών οι Αγανακτισμένοι... |language=Greek |date=29 May 2011|publisher=protothema.gr |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added "movements without ideology and organization, that is to say movements based on anger, can only lead to either an ineffective release [of tension], which at the end of the day is of no interest to the political world, or pave the way for an undemocratic change of regime by organized minorities".&lt;ref name="Ethnos 29" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skai 29" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Proto Thema 29" /&gt; In response, the demonstrations addressed many chants to the vice-president, like "the country is sinking, Theodore, lose some weight!" and other more vulgar ones.&lt;ref name="Ethnos 29" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skai 29" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Proto Thema 29" /&gt;

On 29 May, the spokesman of the Greek government, [[Giorgos Petalotis]], spoke out against Pangalos, saying that Pangalos should remember that when he took part in demonstrations against the dictatorship as a member of the [[Communist Party of Greece|Communist Party]] in 1973, "some people considered these demonstrations provocative".&lt;ref name="Ta Nea Petalotis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tanea.gr/default.asp?pid=2&amp;ct=1&amp;artId=4633196 |script-title=el:Η µεγάλη γιορτή της διαµαρτυρίας |language=Greek |date=30 May 2011|publisher=tanea.gr |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further added that not only does the Indignant Citizens Movement have a clear ideology (even if it is a "technology trend" as Pangalos described it), but that it also "reflects the real needs of the Greek society".&lt;ref name="Ta Nea Petalotis" /&gt; He pointed out that "denial [of the system] and no proposals lead nowhere".&lt;ref name="Ta Nea Petalotis" /&gt;

On 1 June, the [[Prime Minister of Greece]], [[George Papandreou]], commented in regards to the Indignant Citizens Movement saying that "today protesters in Greece and the world are demonstrating against matters of national governance which are more weak than they used to be and, despite their inner weaknesses, are trapped by the global powers and the changes of a global system".&lt;ref name="Skai Papandreou"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/171063/sholio-papandreou-gia-aganaktismenous-polites/ |script-title=el:Σχόλιο Παπανδρέου για "Αγανακτισμένους πολίτες" |language=Greek |date=1 June 2011|publisher=skai.gr |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the blockade of the Parliament by angry citizens on 31 May, which prevented the MPs inside from exiting the building, and also after the angry reactions against the MPs when they were allowed to exit (such as the throwing of empty water bottles, fruit and other objects), the deputy Minister of Education said "I understand that the Indignant Citizens Movement is not a threat to democracy, but violence is, and I condemn it".&lt;ref name="Skai Antidraseis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/greece/article/171043/adidraseis-gia-tin-poliorkia-tis-voulis-apo-aganaktismenous-/ |script-title=el:Αντιδράσεις για την "πολιορκία" της Βουλής από "Αγανακτισμένους" |language=Greek |date=1 June 2011|publisher=skai.gr |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She added that "in a democracy, violence should be prevented and not tolerated" and that "the majority of the MPs in parliament are young; they should receive the same treatment as old MPs".&lt;ref name="Skai Antidraseis" /&gt; The deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs commented that "I can accept tougher questioning and criticism, but not the leveling of our political system. Democracy can give [a] solution. The flattening of our democracy can only lead to a slippery road. The majority of the Greek people can be angry, but not under these circumstances".&lt;ref name="Skai Antidraseis" /&gt;

[[Member of the European Parliament|European Parliament MP]] Theodoros Skylakakis, who is aligned with the newly founded [[Democratic Alliance (Greece)|Democratic Alliance]] party, said that "these people need to get a sense of political ideology and move to a deeper revelation: from what they don't like, to what they like",&lt;ref name="Skai 29 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/170750/skulakakis-ginetai-tsakomos-eno-erhetai-to-tsounami/ |script-title=el:Σκυλακάκης: Γίνεται τσακωμός ενώ έρχεται το τσουνάμι |language=Greek |date=29 May 2011|publisher=skai.gr |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; implying that a non-political movement will be ineffective and without results. [[Alexis Tsipras]], leader of the [[Synaspismos]] radical left party and the first party leader to comment on the demonstrations, said that "no one has the right to make the people [silent], or tell them that they have no say in their country's future by means of a referendum".&lt;ref name="Eleftherotypia Tsipras"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.politikh&amp;id=279502 |script-title=el:Τρέμουν την κοινωνική αναταραχή στην Ευρώπη |language=Greek |date=29 May 2011|publisher=enet.gr |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the [[Left (politics)|Left]] should be supportive of the demonstrations and that "things are turning at a fast pace, and the people are waking up".&lt;ref name="Eleftherotypia Tsipras" /&gt;

The [[Mayor of Athens]] said on 30 May that the protest was a "healthy and sound demonstration", but when a motion was put forth at the municipal council to declare the municipality's support for the demonstrations, the mayor said that he felt "it is not appropriate to express our sympathy".&lt;ref name="Skai 6i" /&gt;

In an interview with a Greek newspaper on 1 June 2011, the Spanish [[Democracia real Ya]]! movement, which organised the [[2011 Spanish Protests]] and sparked the Greek protests, said that its members support the Greek demonstrations and that "this is only the beginning".&lt;ref name="Proto Thema Democracia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protothema.gr/world/article/?aid=125534 |title=H "Πραγματική Δημοκρατία Τώρα" καλεί τους Ελληνες να ξεσηκωθούν! |language=Greek |date=1 June 2011|publisher=protothema.gr |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 2011, 16 parliament members of PASOK publicly demanded of [[George Papandreou]] that the parliament make a full report of country's current financial situation.&lt;ref name="Το Βήμα"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tovima.gr/politics/article/?aid=404346 |script-title=el:Δήμητρα Κρουστάλλη: ΠαΣοΚ: Με επιστολή τους 16 βουλευτές ζητούν άμεση σύγκληση των οργάνων του κόμματος |language=Greek |date=2 June 2011|publisher=tovima.gr |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was caused by the forthcoming second memorandum voting, which [[George Papandreou]] characterised as "urgent".

In the early hours of 22 June 2011, George Papandreou and his government narrowly survived a [[vote of confidence]] in the [[Greek parliament]], with 155 of the 300 seats voting in favour.&lt;ref name="BBC confidence"&gt;{{cite news|title=Greek government survives confidence vote |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-13869428 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 June 2011|date=21 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110622112016/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-13869428| archivedate= 22 June 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 2011, amid violent protests in the square outside parliament, the [[Hellenic Parliament]] voted in favour of passing a new set of [[austerity measures]] with a marginal majority of 155 seats in the 300-seat parliament.&lt;ref name="Skai Mesoprothesmo 30"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/173650/efarmostikos-psifisthike-epi-tis-arhis-apo-155-vouleutes/ |script-title=el:Εφαρμοστικός: Ψηφίσθηκε επί της αρχής από 155 βουλευτές |language=Greek |date=30 June 2011|publisher=skai.gr |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measures themselves had attracted much criticism both from the Greek public and within the country's political scene. Between June and July 2011, [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) went from a 156-seat majority to a 154-seat one, while [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] also lost one seat.

The allegations of [[police brutality]] by Greek and foreign media&lt;ref name="BBC police brutality" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian police brutality" /&gt; as well as [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref name="Amnesty International police brutality" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty International police brutality2" /&gt; sparked heated debate in the [[Hellenic Parliament]], with all parties in the house asking the government for explanations, including MPs of the ruling PASOK party.&lt;ref name="Skai Askos Aiolou"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/173639/anoixe-o-askos-tou-aiolou-sti-vouli-exaitias-ton-epeisodion/ |script-title=el:Άνοιξε ο ασκός του Αιόλου στη Βουλή εξαιτίας των επεισοδίων |language=Greek |date=30 June 2011|publisher=skai.gr |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of the opposition, [[Antonis Samaras]], characterised the situation as almost that of a "parastate",&lt;ref name="Skai Askos Aiolou" /&gt; while [[George Karatzaferis]] of the [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] accused the government of "not being able to control 200 thugs in central Athens".&lt;ref name="Skai Askos Aiolou" /&gt; The [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] party accused the government of "abolishing the very principles of democracy"&lt;ref name="Skai Askos Aiolou" /&gt; and filed a complaint against the government for "cheering while at the same time outside the building tear gas was being overly used".&lt;ref name="Skai Askos Aiolou" /&gt; Members of the parliamentary group of PASOK characterised the actions of the police as "barbaric"&lt;ref name="Skai Askos Aiolou" /&gt; [[Christos Papoutsis]], the [[Minister for Citizen Protection]], denied all accusations claiming that "it's the police that operates, not the government".&lt;ref name="Skai Askos Aiolou" /&gt; Regarding the video in which police are allegedly helping hooded youth, he said that the people in the video are not police;&lt;ref name="Skai Askos Aiolou" /&gt; the Athens Prosecutor accepted the demands for an investigation into the matter.&lt;ref name="Skai Paremvasi" /&gt; On the matter of the attack on the [[Syntagma station|Sytagma Square metro station]] using tear gas by police, the minister said that "people with health issues were transported to hospitals and the others left inside were wearing gas masks more expensive than the ones used by police".&lt;ref name="Skai Askos Aiolou" /&gt; [[Giannis Ragousis]], Minister for Transport, asked for a disciplinary measure to punish those responsible.&lt;ref name="Skai Askos Aiolou" /&gt; The [[European Commission]] stated that any use of violence is sad and unacceptable.&lt;ref name="Skai Askos Aiolou" /&gt;

Additionally, the Greek government has pledged to amend the constitution as a result of the protests.&lt;ref name="Kathimerini referendum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Δημοψήφισμα πριν από την αναθεώρηση |url=http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_1_21/06/2011_446517 |publisher=kathimerini.gr |accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most important aspects of the constitutional reform will be the change of the functions of the Greek political system.&lt;ref name="Kathimerini referendum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Government reform"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ενημέρωση Συντακτών 20.06.2011 |url=http://government.gov.gr/2011/06/20/15769/ |publisher=government.gov.gr |accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek government has said it will open up the discussion on constitutional amendment in September, both to the public and the media.&lt;ref name="Government reform" /&gt; Other media have pointed out that this could not be legal before 2013 because the [[Greek constitutional amendment of 2008|constitutional amendment of 2008]] forbids any other changes to the constitution prior to 2013.&lt;ref name="Kathimerini referendum" /&gt;

====Public perception and media coverage====
In a survey published in June 2011 by Public Issue on behalf of the Greek TV channel [[Skai TV|Skai]], 98% of people asked said they were informed about the protests.&lt;ref name="Public Issue PDF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/files/1/PDF/aganaktismenoi.pdf |script-title=el:Το Κίνημα των Αγανακτισμένων Πολιτών |language=Greek |date=June 2011 |publisher=skai.gr |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, 95% of people asked said they had positive impressions about the movement.&lt;ref name="Public Issue PDF" /&gt; When asked about their overall opinion of the movement, 86% replied either positive (76%) or probably positive (10%) while 6% replied negative, with an additional 2% as probably negative.&lt;ref name="Public Issue PDF" /&gt; 35% of the people asked said they had participated in at least one protest.&lt;ref name="Public Issue PDF" /&gt; When asked about their opinion in regards to the media coverage of the events, 53% replied negative and 39% positive.&lt;ref name="Public Issue PDF" /&gt; 51% thought the demonstrations are a "very important" event, while 34% felt it was "quite important", with 12% replying they viewed it as either not very important or not important at all.&lt;ref name="Public Issue PDF" /&gt; When asked if they believe that the protests may have been politically orchestrated by a political power within the country, 80% replied no and 16% yes.&lt;ref name="Public Issue PDF" /&gt; Finally, 52% believed that the protests will bring results, while 39% believed they will not.&lt;ref name="Public Issue PDF" /&gt;

Demonstrations were scheduled to continue for "as long as it takes".&lt;ref name="Skai Proti Grammi 27" /&gt; These demonstrations were the largest event to be organised over the internet in Greece.&lt;ref name="ERT 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ert.gr/index.php/eidiseis/ellada/38-koinonia/6496-2011-05-26-14-42-50.html |title=''Αγανακτισμένοι'' ξανά ("Outraged" again) |language=Greek |date=26 May 2011|publisher=news.ert.gr |accessdate=26 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110611040609/http://www.ert.gr/index.php/eidiseis/ellada/38-koinonia/6496-2011-05-26-14-42-50.html| archivedate= 11 June 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of [[Skai TV]], [[Star Channel (Greece)|Star Channel]] and Zougla Radio, which provided live coverage of the demonstrations in [[Athens]], media coverage of these events was relatively poor in the first weeks. Major Greek TV channel [[Mega Channel|Mega]] was forced to temporarily deactivate its Facebook page as thousands of people left negative and derogatory comments on the page because the channel did not cover the events of 29 May.&lt;ref name="Eleftherotypia 31" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mega Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/tvmega/posts/211454365562228 |title=Mega Tv's Profile |date=30 May 2011|publisher=facebook.com |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrations did catch the attention of the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the spokesman of the organisation expressed "understanding" for the demonstrators.&lt;ref name="Eleftherotypia 27"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.ellada&amp;id=278949 |title=Κατανοεί τους "Αγανακτισμένους" της Ελλάδας το ΔΝΤ |date=27 May 2011|publisher=enet.gr |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF 27"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/tr/2011/tr052611.htm |title=Transcript of a Press Briefing by Caroline Atkinson, director, External Relations Department, International Monetary Fund |date=26 May 2011|publisher=imf.org |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the demonstrations have also been featured in [[Euronews]], ''[[El País]]'', ''El Economista'' and [[CNN]].&lt;ref name="CNN 100,000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Euronews 25"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euronews.net/2011/05/25/outraged-greek-youth-follow-spanish-example/ |title=Outraged Greek youth follow Spanish example |date=25 May 2011|publisher=euronews.eu |accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El País 25"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2011/05/25/actualidad/1306346980_133998.html |title=Miles de griegos protestan contra los recortes frente al Parlamento de Atenas |language=Spanish |date=25 May 2011|publisher=politica.elpais.com |accessdate=28 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110627053738/http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2011/05/25/actualidad/1306346980_133998.html| archivedate= 27 June 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El Economista 25"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eleconomista.es/mercados-cotizaciones/noticias/3103568/05/11/Miles-de-indignados-griegos-toman-la-plaza-Sintagma-en-contra-de-recortes.html |title=Miles de "indignados" griegos toman la plaza Sintagma en contra de recortes |language=Spanish |date=25 May 2011|publisher=eleconomista.es |accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikis Theodorakis]], prominent Greek songwriter and political activist, especially during the years of the dictatorship (1967–1974), also expressed his support for the movement in an open letter addressed to the demonstrators.&lt;ref name="Eleftherotypia 28 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.politikh&amp;id=279626 |script-title=el:Ο Μίκης στέλνει γράμμα στις Πλατείες |language=Greek |date=28 May 2011|publisher=enet.gr |accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous Greek singer Giannis Kotsiras also expressed his open support for the initiative.

===Other protests in 2011===

On 23 August 2011, there was a demonstration by workers in the tourism sector. The Pan-Worker's Front staged a [[sit-in]] at some of Athens' most famous hotels on [[Syntagma Square]],&lt;ref name="Skai Varea"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/greece/article/177968/pame-bloko-sta-xenodoheia-tis-plateias-sudagmatos/ |script-title=el:Νικητιάδης για τα μπλόκα σε ξενοδοχεία: Λυπηρά φαινόμενα στον τουρισμό |language=Greek |date=23 August 2011|publisher=skai.gr |accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skai Synexizetai"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/greece/article/177987/diamarturia-ergazomenon-ston-tourismo-gia-ta-varea-kai-anthugieina-/ |script-title=el:Συνεχίζεται η διαμαρτυρία εργαζομένων στον τουρισμό για τα βαρέα και ανθυγιεινά |language=Greek |date=23 August 2011|publisher=skai.gr |accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the iconic Electra Palace Hotel in [[Thessaloniki]]'s [[Aristotelous Square]].&lt;ref name="Skai Varea" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skai Synexizetai" /&gt; Meanwhile, the Federation of Tourism Workers held a 24-hour strike and a demonstration in a central square of Athens.&lt;ref name="Skai Varea" /&gt; The Federation also said that they would hold another 24-hour strike, but did not define a date for it.&lt;ref name="Skai Varea" /&gt; The sit-in at various hotels was met with criticism from government officials as well as various labour unions involved in the tourism sector.&lt;ref name="Skai Varea" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skai Synexizetai" /&gt;

====September====
In early September 2011, as new measures were announced by the Minister for Finance on 6 September,&lt;ref name="Eleftherotypia Venizelos Troika"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.oikonomia&amp;id=307512 |script-title=el:Η κυβέρνηση αποφάσισε ό,τι διέταξε η τρόικα |language=Greek |date=6 September 2011|publisher=enet.gr |accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; various unions of the country's public sector announced they would go on strike.&lt;ref name="Skai Baraz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/greece/article/179345/baraz-kinitopoiiseon-kata-ton-kuvernitikon-apofaseon/ |script-title=el:Μπαράζ κινητοποιήσεων κατά των κυβερνητικών αποφάσεων |language=Greek |date=7 September 2011|publisher=skai.gr |accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ta Nea Pyretos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tanea.gr/ellada/article/?aid=4655229 |script-title=el:Απεργιακός "πυρετός" στη χώρα μετά τα μέτρα της κυβέρνησης |language=Greek |date=7 September 2011|publisher=tanea.gr |accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include teachers, doctors, taxi drivers, customs officials and tax collectors,&lt;ref name="Eleftherotypia Eforiakoi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.oikonomia&amp;id=307803 |script-title=el:Απεργούν Δευτέρα και Τρίτη εφοριακοί και τελωνειακοί |language=Greek |date=7 September 2011|publisher=enet.gr |accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[waste collector]]s working for the municipality of [[Athens]].&lt;ref name="Skai Baraz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ta Nea Pyretos" /&gt; Additionally, the [[air traffic controller]]'s union announced that, in the interest of serving the public, air traffic controllers would not go on strike but would refuse to work overtime.&lt;ref name="Eleftherotypia Enaeria"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.ellada&amp;id=307814 |script-title=el:Με λευκή απεργία απειλούν οι ελεγκτές εναέριας κυκλοφορίας |language=Greek |date=7 September 2011|publisher=enet.gr |accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers at the Swedens Urban Transport Organization (which includes the [[Athens Metro]]) are considering going on strike as well.&lt;ref name="Ta Nea Pyretos" /&gt;

====October====
On 5 October 2011, there was a general strike.&lt;ref name="October BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15177457 |title=Greece strike: Police and protesters clash in Athens |date=5 October 2011|publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the demonstrations police clashed with youth and made 10 arrests.&lt;ref name="October Skai"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/greece/article/182418/ennea-sullipseis-kata-ta-epeisodia-stin-athina/ |title=Δέκα συλλήψεις κατά τα επεισόδια στην Αθήνα |date=5 October 2011|publisher=skai.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police are also investigating claims by journalists that they were assaulted by police officers.&lt;ref name="October Skai" /&gt; The police officer who assaulted the journalist was arrested, but then released on 6 October until conclusive evidence is found.&lt;ref name="October Skai 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/greece/article/182533/eleutheros-me-edoli-eisaggelea-afethike-o-astunomikos-pou-htupise-ti-fotoreporter/ |title=Ελεύθερος με εντολή εισαγγελέα αφέθηκε ο αστυνομικός που χτύπησε τη φωτορεπόρτερ |date=5 October 2011|publisher=skai.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were demonstrations in co-ordination with the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement on [[15 October 2011 global protests|15 October]]. Only 7,000 demonstrators, according to estimates by local media, gathered on Syntagma square in a peaceful demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2011/10/15/greek-demonstrators-join-global-day-of-rage/ |title=Greek Demonstrators Join Global "Day of Rage" |date=15 October 2011|publisher=greece.greekreporter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further protests and strikes were organised for 19 and 20 October.

The strikes in fact began on 17 October, when the seaman's union walked off the job for 48 hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/17/us-greece-strikes-idUSTRE79F2XD20111017 |title=Greece heads for standstill before austerity vote |date=17 October 2011|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; shutting down the ferry services between the islands. Customs officials who clear fuel refinery deliveries also held a 24-hour strike that day. The shortage of fuel and goods in the Greek islands due to the strike of ferry and fuel services has already begun to manifest itself.&lt;ref name="Skai Trofima Venzini"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/greece/article/184114/xemenoun-ta-nisia-apo-trofima-venzini-/ |title=Ξεμένουν τα νησιά από τρόφιμα – βενζίνη |accessdate=23 October 2011|publisher=skai.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second day of the protests was marked by clashes between members of [[Communist Party of Greece|Communist Party]] (KKE) and hard-line protestors (mainly [[Anarchism in Greece|anarchists]]) who tried to invade the parliament, resulting in the death of one KKE member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9QG3LKG2.htm |title=1 dead in Athens demonstration clashes |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October (a national holiday [[Ochi Day|in Greece]]), protests occurred nationwide. In [[Thessaloniki]], where a national military parade is held annually, protesters prevented the parade from officially taking place&lt;ref name="Skai Parelasi Thessaloniki" /&gt; (the first time this occurred since the parade was first held in 1941) and shouted slogans against [[Karolos Papoulias]],&lt;ref name="Skai Parelasi Thessaloniki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/greece/article/184631/akurothike-i-parelasi-sti-thessaloniki-apohorise-o-k-papoulias/ |title=Ακυρώθηκε η παρέλαση στη Θεσσαλονίκη – Αποχώρησε οργισμένος ο Κ.

====November====
On 17 November, as part of the ongoing protests that led to the resignation of the [[George Papandreou|Papandreau]] government, over 50 thousand people marched in Athens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/17/us-eurozone-idUSTRE7AC15K20111117 | agency=Reuters | title=Greek protests as France, Spain face squeeze | date=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====December====
On 6 December, to mark an anniversary of the death of [[Alexandros Grigoropoulos]], thousands of people marched on the Parliament building, throwing [[Molotov Cocktail]]s at the police, who responded with tear gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2011/dec/07/greek-protests-student-shooting-anniversary |location=London |work=The Guardian  | title=Greece (News),Protest (News),Europe (News),World news | date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 protests==
On 12 February, as many as 500,000 protesters gathered in Athens outside the Parliament House to voice opposition to [[Lucas Papademos]]' caretaker cabinet's austerity measures which were being debated in Parliament. The passing of the austerity measures is a precondition for the next €130 billion lending package from the [[European Union]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] to the Greek government, without which the country would face [[sovereign default]] by 20 March. Police used large amounts of tear gas and flash grenades, while protesters hurled stones and [[Molotov cocktail]]s. In total 45 buildings were set ablaze and 25 protesters and 40 officers were injured.&lt;ref name="cnn2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/02/12/world/europe/greece-debt-crisis/index.html|title=Clashes erupt as Greek Parliament debates austerity measures|date=12 February 2012|publisher=CNN|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17003432|title=Buildings set ablaze as Greek MPs debate austerity plan|date=12 February 2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests had been preceded by a 24-hour nationwide general strike on 7 February, when the two largest labour unions in Greece said the proposed measures would "drive Greek society to despair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/greek_unions_call_for_strike_austerity_talks_continue_int/24475192.html|title=Greek Unions Call For Strike As Crisis Talks Continue|date=6 February 2012|work=Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty homepage|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to members of Parliament, Papademos called for calm and urged members to pass the plan while asserting that violence and vandalism had no place in democracy. He also stated to the lawmakers that if the majority of them chose to vote against the austerity measures there would be several onerous consequences, including that the government would not be able to pay the salaries of its employees. On 13 February, the Greek Parliament subsequently approved this latest round of austerity measures by a vote of 199 to 74.&lt;ref name="cnn2012" /&gt; On 20 March, the government finally announced they have defaulted and rejected another package from Brussels Bailout and are starting to reform the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/moody-s-greece-default-debt-241/ |title=Moody's: Greece has defaulted — RT News |publisher=Rt.com |date= |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 April, people once again demonstrated against the government after a pensioner named [[Dimitris Christoulas]] committed suicide by shooting himself, refusing to share the fate of those people who have had to search for food in garbage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/greece-protest-pensioner-suicide-306/ |title=Pensioner's suicide over 'occupation govt' sparks riots in Greece (PHOTOS, VIDEO) — RT News |publisher=Rt.com |date=5 April 2012 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/greece-suicide-218/ |title=Pensioner shoots himself at Greek Parliament, refuses to 'search for food in garbage' (PHOTOS) — RT News |publisher=Rt.com |date= |accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atlantic Championship''' is a [[formula racing|formula race car]] series with races throughout North America. It has been called '''Champ Car Atlantics''' (after its former name), '''Toyota Atlantics''' (due to the series' previous history of using Toyota-powered engines), or just Atlantics or '''Formula Atlantic''', although the latter two terms risk confusion with the [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s amateur Formula Atlantics division.

Starting in 2012, the series was revived with SCCA Pro Racing sanction by Formula Race Promotions, with the series last raced in 2009 under IMSA sanction. FRP switched to [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] sanctioning in 2017.

==Series information==
The Atlantics series is a developmental [[open-wheel]] racing series in North America, also called a "ladder series". In 2005, a new factor was announced to solidify this reputation as the last series in which a driver will compete before moving to [[Champ Car]], or the highest levels of sports car racing such as [[American Le Mans]].  A [[United States dollar|US$]]2 million prize was announced for the winner of the 2006 racing season and future seasons, with the restriction that it can only be used towards the cost of racing in the [[Champ Car|Champ Car World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.champcarworldseries.com/News/Article.asp?ID=9659 Champ Car &gt; News Friday, September 16, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Pagenaud]] became champion in 2006 and claimed the first such prize. He promptly moved to Champ Car in 2007 to race for [[Walker Racing]].

The series champion for 2007, [[Raphael Matos]], also won the $2 million prize towards a Champ Car ride.  However, he elected not to accept it as he felt that without other sponsorship, he would be driving for a non-competitive team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crash.net/motorsport/indycar/news/159025-0/content.html Indycar: Matos may race 500., motorsport news, results, features, teams, drivers, updates&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Matos instead accepted an offer from the [[Andretti Green Racing]] team in the developmental [[Firestone Indy Lights Series]] instead, where he was promised the chance to race in the [[Indy 500]] and a future ride in the [[IndyCar Series]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indycar.com/pro/news/story.php?story_id=10426 Looking forward :: Indy Racing League Indy Pro Series&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  2007 runner-up [[Franck Perera]], who finished on the podium eight times during the season and won three races ultimately signed to race with Champ Car team [[Conquest Racing]]. When Champ Car was purchased by IndyCar prior to the 2008 season, Conquest joined IndyCar with Perera.

As of 2009, the series offers an unrestricted $1 million prize to the season champion, $500,000 to the runner-up, and $250,000 to the third-place finisher on the season. These season rewards are part of total of $3 million in total prize money, which also features $50,000 for each race win, and other bonuses such as a monetary [[pole position]] reward.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=318038&amp;FS=atlantic&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race equipment===
Starting in 2006, the series has been run exclusively with [[Swift Engineering|Swift]] 016.a chassis powered by [[Mazda]]-[[Cosworth]] MZR 2300&amp;nbsp;cm³ (2.3 L) [[DOHC]] [[inline-4]] engines producing 300&amp;nbsp;bhp (224&amp;nbsp;kW). The cars are capable of speeds in excess of 175&amp;nbsp;mph (280&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref&gt;[http://champcaratlantic.com/News/Article.asp?ID=3322 Champ Car Atlantic News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new formula has lowered the costs of running a full Atlantic season to around $500,000–$600,000.  This reduction in costs, plus the addition of the aforementioned $2 million prize, had an immediate effect on increasing the number of competitors in the series (car count), which had dwindled over the previous few seasons.  For example, the 2007 season featured 30 drivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.champcaratlantic.com/Drivers/DriverIndex.asp Champ Car Atlantic Drivers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213145014/http://www.champcaratlantic.com/Drivers/DriverIndex.asp |date=December 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the series had been run on Yokohama tires since 1991, the Japanese company elected to end its relationship with the series after the 2006 series, at which point it was replaced by [[Cooper Tire]] and became title sponsor for the series.

==History==
&lt;!--[[Image:2005 Toyota Atlantic Championship season (logo).jpg|right|thumb|2005 Toyota Atlantic Championship logo]]--&gt;
&lt;!--[[File:Atlantic Championship Champ Car 2007 logo.svg|right|thumb|2007 Champ Car Atlantic logo]]--&gt;

The history of Formula Atlantic begins with the [[SCCA]] Formula B class, created in 1965 for single-seat formula cars with engines not exceeding 1600&amp;nbsp;cm³ in capacity. Prior to Formula Atlantic, professional Formula B races were held in the United States from 1965 to 1972, first with the SCCA's poorly supported Formula A, then as part of the SCCA Formula Continental Championship in 1968 (when they were largely overshadowed by the V8-powered [[Formula 5000]] cars) and then as an independent series from 1969 to 1972.

Formula Atlantic as a class evolved in the United Kingdom in 1971 from the US Formula B rules, with 1600&amp;nbsp;cm³ production-based twin-cam engines (initially dominated by [[Lotus-Ford Twin Cam]]-based dry-sump [[Cosworth]] Mk.XIII, then by Cosworth BDD when the class became Atlantic in the United States, however other engines like Alfa Romeo and BMW were also eligible). Conceived by John Webb of [[Brands Hatch]] (who would later also develop the [[Sports 2000]] class) as a category for national competitors with the performance near a Formula Two car but running costs at or below that of a contemporary Formula Three car. A single ([[Yellow Pages]] championship ran in 1971–72, with a rival [[British Petroleum|BP]] backed series appearing in 1973. 1974 saw the BP series changing sponsor to [[Imperial Tobacco|John Player]] and the Yellow Pages series becoming backed by John Webb's MCD organisation and Southern Organs. In practice most top drivers competed in both series and there were no date clashes. Only one series ran in 1975-76, in the final year taking the title '''Indylantic'' and adopting Indianapolis-style single-car qualifying. But the formula was under threat from [[Formula 3]] and no series ran in 1977–78. The series returned in 1979 with backing (for one season only) from [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] and continued to 1983, with diminishing grids and few new cars appearing.

As a result of its similarity to [[Formula 2]] and [[Formula 3]] in terms of chassis regulations, Formula Atlantic typically used chassis closely related to these cars — with performance somewhere in between the two — so most of the manufacturers were familiar from those classes, particularly the likes of [[Brabham]], [[Team Lotus|Lotus]], [[March Engineering|March]], [[Chevron Cars Ltd|Chevron]] early on, with [[Ralt]] and then [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]] later. US manufacturer [[Swift Engineering|Swift]] came to displace the British imports and dominate in North America. Several smaller marques also appeared.

The first professional races run under Formula Atlantic rules in North America were conducted in 1974 by the [[Canadian Automobile Sport Clubs]] (CASC) in Canada (now ASN Canada), drawing much attention and large fields due to its national [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] television coverage. [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] in the United States took advantage of the large number of teams and organized its own series in 1976.

During these years, the series attracted guest drivers from Europe, including Formula One, particularly at the [[Trois-Rivières, Quebec|Trois-Rivières]] street race in Quebec, Canada. Guest drivers included [[James Hunt]], [[Jean-Pierre Jarier]], [[Riccardo Patrese]], [[Patrick Depailler]], [[Jacques Laffite]], [[Didier Pironi]] and [[Vittorio Brambilla]].

In 1977, the SCCA sanctioned the US events and in 1978 the CASC and SCCA series merged and conducted the series jointly until 1983, when it ran as the ''Formula Mondial North American Cup''; [[Michael Andretti]] won the championship. The series could not sustain the success of earlier seasons and was cancelled for 1984.

In its place a "Pacific" series was conducted exclusively on the US West Coast in 1985. This rebirth expanded to an East Coast "Atlantic" series the following year and the two ran concurrently through 1990. From 1990 to 2005, the series was sponsored by [[Toyota]] and the cars were powered by 1600 cc [[Toyota 4A-GE]] engines available in kit form from [[Toyota Racing Development]]. With the support of Toyota, the two US series were reunited into a single North American championship and have remained so to this date.

[[Image:CCFA6086.jpg|thumb|550px|2006 Champ Car Atlantic Drivers pose for group photo at California Speedway]]

The same rules were adopted as [[Formula Pacific]] (not to be confused with the US Formula Atlantic Pacific Championship) and races were run in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], where Formula Pacific became the top class of racing. For a few years the prestigious [[Macau Grand Prix]] was run to Formula Pacific rules before becoming a [[Formula Three]] race. South Africa also adopted Formula Atlantic rules, but later mandated that the cars were fitted with [[Mazda]] [[Wankel]] engines.

In recognition of the global acceptance of the formula it was briefly renamed [[Formula Mondial]] in 1983, but this series failed to materialize.

Among Atlantic drivers in races through 1982 were Keke Rosberg, Gilles villeneuve, Michael Andretti, Bobby Rahal, Howdy Holmes, Tom Gloy, Dave McMikllan, Kevin Cogn, Jacques Villeneuve Sr, Chris Kneifel and Roberto Moreno.

In 1983, Jon Norman, Gudrun and Rick Shea and Tim Fortner, formed West Coast Atlantic Racing - WCAR - and ran a series of professional races for Atlantic cars on the U.S. west coast, with Al Brizzard as Chief Steward. WCAR had originally sprung up with the FIA's "Formula Mondial" championship and when that folded prematurely, WCAR became Atlantic racing in the United States.

On the east coast, Vicki O'Connor decided to establish a similar series. Thus, East Coast Atlantic Racing - ECAR - was born. Simultaneously, Vicki established Pro-Motion Agency Ltd as the organizing and managing body to run the series and had SCCA as the sanctioning body.

The first ECAR race was at Summit Point Motorsports Park in West Virginia on 07 Jul 1985. Incidentally, this race and all subsequent Atlantic series races except those on ovals, used a series signature standing start following a group warm-up lap.

Both WCAR and ECAR ran races for a while until the two series were merged under Vicki's management in 1991.

Vicki brought to the management of the Atlantic series the many years of experience she'd accumulated while working for [[Carl Haas]] in his Lola, Hewland and other racing equipment import business, and more directly, her involvement in Carl's race team management in the CanAm and other series.

Vicki's biography as a member of the Road Racing Drivers Club reads in part "… the Toyota Atlantic Series which developed into the most successful and longest-running open-wheel driver development series in North America".

The Toyota Atlantic Series ran on road courses, ovals,  street courses and airports in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The success of the series brought it the sponsorship and engine development of Toyota Motor Corporation in 1989 under its North American competition division, [[Toyota Racing Development]], led by Les Unger.

Later races were sanctioned by CART (Championship Auto Racing Teams) when CART bought Promotion Agency, LTD.  When Champ Car succeeded CARt in 2004, Toyota Atlantic continued under their sanctioning.  The series ended with the bankruptcy of Champ Car in 2007.

The series raised to prominence a great number of drivers including Michael Andretti, Jacques Vlleneuve, Scott Goodyear, Joey Hand, Buddy Rice, Sam Hornish, Ryan Hunter-Reay, Brian Till, Dan Wheldon, Alex Tagliani, Calvin Fish, Danica Patrick, Simon Pagenaud, A. J. Allmendinger, Graham Rahal and Katherine Legge.

The latest in a long line of television celebrities to enter this series—starting with [[Dick Smothers]] at the very first race in 1968&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldracingcars.com/results/result.php?RaceID=CL68 OldRacingCars.com | US Formula 5000 | Continental Divide 26 May 1968&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;—was [[Frankie Muniz]] of the [[Fox Network]] comedy [[Malcolm in the Middle]], making his debut in 2007.  Sharing the dream of many American open wheel racers, Muniz stated his intention to use Champ Car Atlantics as a direct path to racing in the [[Champ Car World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankiemunizracing.com/apr2007.html Frankie Muniz Racing - April 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015040713/http://www.frankiemunizracing.com/apr2007.html |date=October 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in the Atlantic Championship===
A few women have chosen to participate in Atlantic racing under the Toyota Atlantic or Atlantic Championship powered by Mazda banner.

As mentioned in the list of former drivers, [[Danica Patrick]] was an Atlantic competitor in 2003 and 2004. She was the first woman to score a pole position in the series and the first woman to finish on the podium. She also led the 2004 season briefly before finishing third overall in season results, but did not score a win in two years of Atlantic competition.

[[Katherine Legge]] also competed in Atlantic for a season.  In 2005, she became the first woman in history to win a professional open wheel race in North America, at [[Long Beach Grand Prix|Long Beach, CA]].  She then amassed two more wins in the same season and finished third overall in season results.

Christal Waddy was the first African American female Motorsport Director in the United States for a professional motorsport team.  In 2006 Christal campaigned a two car entry for car owner Bob Gelles of Gelles Racing sponsored by Western Union.  Driver [[Robbie Pecorari]] won a race in Toronto, Canada and finished eleventh in points.  [[Stephen Simpson]] competed in three races with his best finish of fifth place in Monterrey, Mexico.  Christal was also the owner of sponsor Roadblock Protective Systems and Team Manager for BMW of Sterling Motorsports.

[[Simona De Silvestro]] was an Atlantic Championship contender who led a large portion [[2009 Atlantic Championship season]], ultimately finishing third.  In three years in the series, she has bettered Katherine Legge's career mark of three wins, with one in 2008 and four in 2009.

===Series ownership and sponsor commitments===
On October 31, 2008, an official announcement was made that the Atlantic Championship series had been purchased by Ben Johnston, an Atlanta area businessman and one-time Atlantic racer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crash.net/motorsport/indycar/news/171247-0/content.html&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Mazda and Cooper Tires also announced a continuing commitment to the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f1sa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8387&amp;Itemid=219 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328180837/http://www.f1sa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8387&amp;Itemid=219 |archivedate=2009-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 2009, Mazda recommitted its support to the Atlantic Championship by extending an engine contract that covers the series through the year 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whowon.com/sResults.asp?SanctionID%3D1289%26StoryID%3D270251 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528203335/http://www.whowon.com/sResults.asp?SanctionID=1289&amp;StoryID=270251 |archivedate=2009-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television and other video==
Atlantic Championship races have previously been shown on multiple networks, including [[Speed (TV channel)|SPEED]]. For 2009, a new [[high definition television]] package was announced on [[HDNet]], which features live coverage of certain events and replays of others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2009/06/05/464552.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Web video of events has also historically been available on the series website, and the series also has its own official [[YouTube]] channel under the username "AtlanticRacingSeries."

==Current status of series==

In early 2010, Atlantic Championship personnel publicized several features intended to attract new drivers and retain existing racers and teams. One was to brand the series as the "Road to F1", announcing that "at least one current European F1 team manager" would be in attendance to monitor a test for interested racers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atlantic-championship.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=124:atlantic-championship-series-announces-more-for-less-on-the-road-to-f1&amp;catid=1:series-news&amp;Itemid=1&lt;/ref&gt; Another was to announce prize money that would be paid directly to drivers, rather than to teams.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atlantic-championship.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=126:atlantic-championship-series-announces-2010-prize-fund-for-drivers-&amp;catid=1:series-news&amp;Itemid=1&lt;/ref&gt; Another press release listed teams that were committed to the series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atlantic-championship.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=127:atlantic-grid-for-sebring-season-opener-filling-up-fast&amp;catid=1:series-news&amp;Itemid=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these efforts, on March 3, 2010 series officials announced that the 2010 season had been put on hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racer.com/atlantic-championship-on-hold-for-2010/article/165031/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307093654/http://www.racer.com/atlantic-championship-on-hold-for-2010/article/165031/ |archivedate=2010-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Davis of Mazda North American Operations said: "All of us at Mazda are disappointed that the Atlantic Championship will be on hiatus this year."  Series president Ben Johnston stated: "The Atlantic Championship office will be working during the down time in order to deliver an unparalleled racing offering when economic conditions allow."

On December 29, 2011, Mike Rand, Bob Wright and Al Guibord Jr. of Formula Race Promotions, which operates the F1600 and [[F2000 Championship Series]] sanctioned by the [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s Pro Racing Division, announced the Atlantic Championship would be revived for the 2012 season with a schedule that will be held during three of their F1600 and F2000 series weekends - [[Road Atlanta]] (May 10–12), [[New Jersey Motorsports Park]] (June 28-July 1) and [[Summit Point Raceway]] (August 24–26).  SCCA engine and chassis rules will apply and the cars will race exclusively on Hoosier tires.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atlanticchampionshipseries.com/news/483-atlantic-championship-series-launching-for-2012.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 2012, it was announced that the 2013 schedule had been suspended.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atlanticchampionshipseries.com/news/535-atlantic-championship-series-suspended-for-2013.html&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 2013, it was announced that the series would return in 2014 with a twelve race, six weekend race calendar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racer.com/atlantic-championship-series-expands-for-2014/article/314140/ Atlantic Championship series expands for 2014], ''Racer'', October 1, 2013, Retrieved 2013-10-02&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[2017 Atlantic Championship]], sanctioning transitioned from the SCCA to the [[United States Auto Club]] but Formula Race Promotions continued in their role as promoter.

In 2018, the series will allow the former [[Star Mazda]] cars to compete.

The '''awareness avatar''' is a method of creating rapid awareness in social media through [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] modification or a single icon's use. The awareness avatar may have first been used in the [[New Zealand Internet Blackout]], to protest copyright law changes in New Zealand. Globally, protesters replaced their icons with black squares to show solidarity. The protest was successful and proved the method effective at both raising awareness and effecting change.

Since, other campaigns have used this protest method.

== History ==
On 16 December 1971 Bangladesh won its independence from [[Pakistan]] through the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladesh Liberation war]]. There was mass [[Rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War|rape during the Bangladesh Liberation war]] with an estimated 200,000-400,000 women were raped by [[Pakistan Army]] and their collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/leesa-gazi-/birangona-women-of-war_b_5030204.html|title = Birangona: Will the World Listen?|website = The Huffington Post|language = en-GB|access-date = 2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thedailystar.net/in-focus/the-war-not-over-yet-1380949|title = “The war is not over yet”|date = 2017-03-25|work = The Daily Star|access-date = 2017-04-21|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 1971 the Government of Bangladesh declared women who had been raped Birangona or war-heroine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/long-form/history-and-the-birangona-1380280|title = HISTORY AND THE BIRANGONA|date = 2017-03-24|work = The Daily Star|access-date = 2017-04-21|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] asked Bangladesh to "''give due honor and dignity to the women oppressed by the Pakistani army''" and called them his daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archive.thedailystar.net/forum/2011/march/liberating.htm|title = Forum|website = archive.thedailystar.net|access-date = 2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4WEBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA277&amp;dq=Birangona&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVtMWbvLbTAhUJRiYKHYLpAiIQ6AEIXjAL#v=onepage&amp;q=Birangona&amp;f=false|title = Children and Global Conflict|last = Huynh|first = Kim|last2 = D'Costa|first2 = Bina|last3 = Lee-Koo|first3 = Katrina|date = 2015-04-09|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year =|isbn = 9781107038844|location =|pages = 277|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet many of them committed suicide, a section of them left the country to work as servants abroad, and a great many were killed in the hands of the unskilled mid-wives during abortion. This prompted the government to set up 'seba sadans' to give them clinical support. Kendrio Mohila Punorbashon Songstha was established in January 1972 to rehabilitate these violated women with the  technical and humanitarian support from International Planned Parenthood, the International Abortion Research and Training Centre, and the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Milon, A. Z. M. M. M. (2012). The Crime Never Considered a Crime.http://archive.thedailystar.net/forum/2012/March/land.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the government provided them with vocational training and launched a campaign to get them married. Which led to accusations that Bangladesh was trying to hide the Birongonas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thedailystar.net/healing-the-hidden-wounds-of-war-53558|title = Healing the Hidden Wounds of War|date = 2014-12-05|work = The Daily Star|access-date = 2017-04-21|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Birangonas have often been ostracised by society and their family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thedailystar.net/shedding-the-cloak-of-invisibility-10033|title = Shedding the Cloak of Invisibility|date = 2014-02-07|work = The Daily Star|access-date = 2017-04-21|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6916">The '''Black and White Ball''' was a [[masquerade ball]] held on November 28, 1966 at the [[Plaza Hotel]] in [[New York City]]. Hosted by author [[Truman Capote]], the ball was in honor of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' publisher [[Katharine Graham]].

==Impulse==
[[Truman Capote]] decided in June 1966 to throw a lavish party. He was at the height of his popularity as an author and as a public figure following the publication of his [[non-fiction novel]], ''[[In Cold Blood]]'', earlier that year. For the first time Capote had the financial resources to host a party he deemed worthy of the friends he had cultivated in [[High society (group)|high society]].

According to Capote's friend, the writer and editor [[Leo Lerman]], Capote had declared in 1942 on a journey to the writer's colony [[Yaddo]] that when he, Capote, became rich and famous he would throw a party for his rich and famous friends. Capote always discounted the story but through constant repetition it became part of the ball's legend.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Capote's friend, author [[Dominick Dunne]], had given a black and white ball in 1964 for his tenth wedding anniversary. Capote attended with Alvin Dewey and others he had met while researching ''In Cold Blood''.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, quoted in Plimpton, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Capote was also inspired by the "[[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]] scene" from the film ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' in which the women were all dressed in black and white.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning==
After deciding to throw the party, Capote had to select a guest of honor. Throwing the party for himself would have been viewed by his society friends as vulgar. Rather than selecting from amongst his stable of beautiful society women he called his "swans", Capote chose ''The Washington Post'' publisher Katharine Graham. "Truman called me up that summer and said, 'I think you need cheering up. And I'm going to give you a ball.'...I was...sort of baffled....I felt a little bit like Truman was going to give the ball anyway and that I was part of the props."&lt;ref&gt;Graham, quoted in Plimpton, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

For his venue, Capote chose the Grand Ballroom of the [[Plaza Hotel]] in New York City. Capote had long held a deep affection for the Plaza, even setting the opening scene of his attempted first novel, ''[[Summer Crossing]]'', in a Plaza dining room.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Capote enlisted Evie Backer, who had decorated his apartment at [[United Nations Plaza (street)|United Nations Plaza]], for the event's decor.&lt;ref name = happening&gt;{{Cite news 
  | title = Party's a Social 'Happening'
  | newspaper = St. Petersburg Times
  | page = 6-D
  | publisher = The Washington Post
  | date = 1966-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Capote planned to cover the ballroom's white and gold walls with heavy red drapes but Backer and Capote's friend [[Babe Paley]] convinced him to abandon this idea.&lt;ref name = davis157&gt;Davis, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he brought in the color with red tablecloths. Rather than flowers, Capote had the tables adorned with gold candelabra wound with [[smilax]] and bearing white tapers.&lt;ref name = happening /&gt; The night's menu, to be served at midnight, consisted of scrambled eggs, sausages, biscuits, pastries, spaghetti and meatballs and chicken hash, a specialty of the Plaza and one of Capote's favorite dishes.  To drink Capote laid in 450 bottles of [[Taittinger]] champagne.&lt;ref name = davis157 /&gt;

Capote spent a total of $16,000 on the ball.&lt;ref name = plaza&gt;Gathje, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guest list==
Capote purchased a black-and-white composition book and spent most of July sitting by his friend [[Eleanor Friede|Eleanor Friede's]] pool compiling his initial guest list.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; Capote carried the book with him everywhere he went for the next three months, constantly adding and deleting names.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

==November 28, 1966==
Before the ball, many of the guests attended one of sixteen small private dinner parties that Capote's friends had been drafted to host.

==After the ball==
The Black and White Ball was credited with starting an immediate upsurge in masquerade and costume parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news 
  | last = "Our Own Correspondent"
  | title = Jet Set crowd put New York in daze
  | newspaper = Sydney Morning Herald
  | page = 42
  | date = 1966-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "a pinnacle of New York's social history".&lt;ref&gt;Nowell, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Six days after the ball, on the December 4 episode of the television panel show ''[[What's My Line?]],'' panelist [[Arlene Francis]] wore the mask she had worn at the party, transformed into a blindfold. The wearing of blindfolds during the show's special Mystery Guest segment was customary on the part of the panel.

==Re-creations==
Princess [[Yasmin Aga Khan]] hosted a Black and White Ball in 1991, commemorating the 25th anniversary of the original. The ball, held in a tent outside [[Tavern on the Green]], was a charity event that raised $1.4 million for the Alzheimer's Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

  | first = Georgia
  | title = Silver Anniversary, in Black and White
  | newspaper = The New York Times
  | page = 29
  | date = 1991-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In anticipation of selling the contents of the Plaza Hotel, [[Christie's]] Auction House recreated the Black and White Ball in 2006 at [[Rockefeller Center]]. The event followed Capote's dress code, schedule and menu exactly and the [[Peter Duchin]] Orchestra, which had played the original, played the recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news 
  | title = Black and White Magic
  | newspaper = Town &amp; Country

TV chef [[Ina Garten]] recreated a scaled-down version of the event for a themed dinner party on her daytime cookery show [[Barefoot Contessa]]. She served chicken hash followed by French toast and truffles for dessert, in keeping with the black and white theme of Capote's party.

The '''Brighton Applefest''' was created in 1975 by the merchants of [[Brighton, Ontario|Brighton]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] to promote the Brighton area, and the [[apple]]-based culture around it.&lt;ref name="AppleHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.applefest.reach.net/history.html|title= The History of Applefest|publisher= Brighton Applefest|accessdate= 2012-07-04|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120222112000/http://www.applefest.reach.net/history.html|archivedate= 2012-02-22|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now Brighton's largest yearly event, taking place annually during the last week of September, and can draw up to 30,000 visitors. The attendance at the 2011 festival, which did not feature the typical car show, was estimated at 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.northumberlandnews.com/news/article/1111103--brighton-applefest-draws-thousands |last= Longwell|first= Karen|title= Brighton Applefest draws thousands|newspaper= Northumberland News|date= 2011-09-28|accessdate= 2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival offers a variety of attractions. Its primary draw is its parade, and a street festival featuring fresh foods and local crafts. Other attractions include [[hayride]]s, a classic car show, live music, and a children's [[amusement park]], in addition to a vendors selling local arts and crafts.

'''''Clash of Loyalties''''' ({{lang-ar|Al-Mas'ala Al-Kubra}}, aka '''''The Great Question''''') is a 1983 Iraqi film focusing on the formation of [[Iraq]] out of [[Mesopotamia]] in the aftermath of the First World War.&lt;ref name=Armes206 /&gt;

The film was financed by [[Saddam Hussein]], filmed in Iraq (mainly at the Baghdad Film Studios in [[Baghdad]]'s [[Mansour neighbourhood]] and on location at the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system|Tigris-Euphrates marshlands]], [[Babylon]] and [[Kut]]) at the height of the [[Iran–Iraq War]] and starred [[Oliver Reed]] as [[Gerard Leachman]], [[Marc Sinden]] as Captain Dawson&lt;ref name="The Film Programme interview"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Film Programme interview| date=2011-08-05| newspaper=BBC Radio 4| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b012x12w/The_Film_Programme_05_08_2011/| accessdate=2011-08-06| ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Helen Ryan]] as [[Gertrude Bell]], with a stirring score by [[Ron Goodwin]].&lt;ref name="IMDB - cast credits"&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085911/fullcredits#cast|title=IMDB - cast credits|accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigative journalist James Montague, writing in the July 2014 issue of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine, claimed that [[Marc Sinden]] spied for the British Government's [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6) during the filming of ''Clash of Loyalties'' in Iraq, after being made "an offer he couldn’t refuse, appealing to his duty and his pride in Queen and Country." In the article Sinden admitted that it was true.&lt;ref name="When Saddam Met Oliver Reed"&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|url=http://www.esquireme.com/saddam-met-oliver-reed/|title=When Saddam Met Oliver Reed by James Montague|publisher=''Esquire Magazine''|date=15 July 2014|accessdate=15 July 2014|location=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204080237/http://www.esquireme.com/saddam-met-oliver-reed/|archivedate=4 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/07/24/oliver-reed-saddam-hussein-and-the-true-story-of-the-worlds-most/&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known for being the last film made to use the now banned "Running W" technique, invented by famed stuntman [[Yakima Canutt|Yakima (Yak) Canutt]], which was a method of bringing down a horse at the gallop by attaching a wire, anchored to the ground, to its fetlocks and so launching the rider forwards spectacularly at a designated point. It invariably killed the horse, or at best it was unrideable afterwards.&lt;ref name=Baxter&gt;{{cite book |title=Stunt: the story of the great movie stunt men|last=Baxter|first=John O. |year=1974 |publisher= Garden City, N.Y: Doubleday.|isbn=0-385-06520-5 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British stuntman Ken Buckle (who had been trained by Yak) performed the highly-dangerous stunt three times during the huge cavalry charge sequence.&lt;ref name="The Film Programme interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kent Messenger 12/10/84"&gt;Kent Messenger 12/10/84&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18688">The online distribution of counterfeit medicines has been growing during the last decades. The role of [[Internet]] as an unregulated medicine market is the main reasons behind this phenomenon, especially the effectiveness of “[[Spam (electronic)|spam]]” as a tool for advertising and promoting these products. Websites and social media are new powerful instruments that [[organized crime|organized criminal groups]] could exploit to conduct their illicit businesses. The spread of this emerging threat worldwide poses a very high risk for the health and safety of unaware consumers.

On 29 May 2017, the World Health Assembly hosted by the [[World Health Organization]] agreed to have “Substandard and Falsified (SF) medical products” as the term to be used in all future documentation on the subject of substandard, spurious, falsified, falsely-labelled and counterfeit (SSFFC) medical products.&lt;ref&gt;For more information see also WHO website: http://www.who.int/medicines/regulation/ssffc/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, a [[counterfeit medications|counterfeit medicine]] is a falsified pharmaceutical product. The term "counterfeit" is avoided as this is connected to intellectual property rights rather than public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1470-2045(18)30101-3 | author = Venhuis BJ, Oostlander AE, Giorgio DD, Mosimann R, du Plessis I. | title = Oncology drugs in the crosshairs of pharmaceutical crime. | year = 2018 | volume = 19 | journal= The Lancet Oncology | pages=e209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning associated with “counterfeit medicines” incorporates various cases that are ascribable to the intentional replication of a product, or product parts, without permission.

==Role of the Internet==
The Internet has radically changed the approach towards commerce, drastically modifying also buyers’ attitudes towards the purchase of goods in general. Research has demonstrated that using a computer to fill a prescription online and using online chat groups to learn about health topics are strong independent predictors of prescription drug importation from foreign countries by United States consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zullo|first1=Andrew R.|last2=Dore|first2=David D.|last3=Galárraga|first3=Omar|title=Development and validation of an index to predict personal prescription drug importation by adults in the United States|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical Health Services Research|date=March 2015|volume=6|issue=1|pages=33–41|doi=10.1111/jphs.12088|pmid=27375777|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jphs.12088/full|accessdate=27 July 2015|pmc=4930104}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cheap prices are often the primary reason behind consumers’ purchase decisions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zullo|first1=AR|last2=Howe|first2=CJ|last3=Galárraga|first3=O|title=Estimating the Effect of Health Insurance on Personal Prescription Drug Importation|journal=Medical care research and review : MCRR|volume=74|issue=2|pages=178–207|date=2 February 2016|pmid=26837427|pmc=4970983|doi=10.1177/1077558716629039}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nonetheless, in the specific case of medicines the level of anonymity granted by the Internet is another driving motive pushing consumers to prefer online consumers (i.e. those people suffering from diseases considered as taboos, such as sexual or psychological illnesses);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zullo|first1=AR|last2=Howe|first2=CJ|last3=Galárraga|first3=O|title=Estimating the Effect of Health Insurance on Personal Prescription Drug Importation|journal=Medical care research and review : MCRR|volume=74|issue=2|pages=178–207|date=2 February 2016|pmid=26837427|pmc=4970983|doi=10.1177/1077558716629039}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Practical convenience is another good reason: pharmaceuticals are delivered directly at consumers’ place;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zullo|first1=AR|last2=Howe|first2=CJ|last3=Galárraga|first3=O|title=Estimating the Effect of Health Insurance on Personal Prescription Drug Importation|journal=Medical care research and review : MCRR|volume=74|issue=2|pages=178–207|date=2 February 2016|pmid=26837427|pmc=4970983|doi=10.1177/1077558716629039}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Consumers can also find online a wider range of products, not always authorized in their own countries (''illegal medicines'').

If on the one side the Internet created new opportunities for [[consumer]]s, on the other it also represents a new powerful instrument that organized criminals could exploit to conduct their illicit businesses. With the Internet criminals have found an emerging marketplace that could possibly be exploited in many different ways to take advantage of the almost unlimited possibilities offered by [[cyberspace]].&lt;ref&gt;For more in-depth information on the role of Internet in counterfeiting see UNICRI (2007), Counterfeiting: a global spread a global threat, chapter 5, p.89, available online at: http://counterfeiting.unicri.it/report2008.php&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent years counterfeiters have been exploiting the Internet as an important channel to offer counterfeit medicines both at the wholesale and at the retail level, often creating an independent distribution process which directly targets distributors and final users.

At the wholesale, counterfeiter can exploit distributors’ constant search for low costs products to maximize the profit.  For what concerns the [[retail]] level, counterfeiters deceive consumers both with low prices and by sending a constant stream of spam messages to their e-mail inboxes. It is clear that the development of new communication technologies and the possibility of exploiting the massive Internet market, has unwillingly favored illegal activities.

==E-pharmacies==
Browsing through the Internet, it is easy to hit on [[online pharmacy|online pharmacies]] that operate according to the regulations and with transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zullo|first1=AR|last2=Howe|first2=CJ|last3=Galárraga|first3=O|title=Estimating the Effect of Health Insurance on Personal Prescription Drug Importation|journal=Medical care research and review : MCRR|volume=74|issue=2|pages=178–207|date=2 February 2016|pmid=26837427|pmc=4970983|doi=10.1177/1077558716629039}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, criminals are harsh unscrupulous competitors who advertise fake drugs and put at risk the reputation of all online pharmacies which operate honestly. 
However, the Internet nowadays plays a significant role in the worldwide diffusion of counterfeit pharmaceutical products. 
To support the business of legal online pharmacies, some institutions (for instance in the U.S.) developed an accreditation system for both online pharmacies connected with territorial ones and for those only operating through the Internet. Main limits concerning these systems are: the official seals of these institutions, to be posted on pharmacies website as a warrantee, can be roughly imitated; these institutions operate at the national level and, due to the different domestic laws of the countries, it is difficult for any of them to provide customers with reliable information concerning the quality of pharmaceuticals available online.

An overview of the various typologies of illicit e-pharmacies is now presented, basically focused on rogue and fake e-pharmacies.&lt;ref&gt;See also AIFA-EDQM (2011), "Counterfeit Medical Products and Similar Crimes. Risk Communication"&lt;/ref&gt; 
Rogue e-pharmacies are those that not adhere to accepted standards of medicine and/or pharmacy practice, including standards of safety, thus violating regulations, and those that engage in fraudulent and deceptive business practices. They sell counterfeit pharmaceuticals through ad hoc designed websites which pretend authenticity and often contain features which aim to imitate legitimate ones. The impact of illicit e-pharmacies should not be underestimated: sewage epidemiology showed that &gt;60% of the consumed sildenafil in the Netherlands was obtained from illegal sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bmj.g4317 | author = Venhuis BJ, de Voogt, P, Emke, E, Causanilles, A, Keizers, PHJ | title = Success of rogue online pharmacies: sewage study of sildenafil in the Netherlands | year = 2014 | volume = 349 | pmid = 24989165 | journal=BMJ | pages=g4317}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumers still seem unable to grasp the risks associated with this particular issue. This happens also because the issue of online sales of counterfeit medicines does not seem to receive due attention by the media. 
On the other side, through fake e-pharmacies cyber criminals do not really sell medicines, but only use them as baits to defraud online buyers, as in the case of [[Identity theft|ID theft]] and credit card cloning. The scheme implies a spider-web composed of numerous websites aiming to attract victims. The goal is to infect the computers of the latter with a virus to steal valuable data.

Both types of deceptive e-pharmacies - rogue and fake ones - are often efficiently promoted by spam messages, which work even better during times of health crisis, when people go into frenzy over certain types of medicines and when there is a surge of [[computer crime|cyber criminals]] seeking to cash in on the pandemic.

==Deceiving strategies and tools used by criminals==
The exploitation of the Internet by criminals caused the spread of uncontrolled and unverified pieces of information and products.
Internet search engines, for instance, unwillingly contribute to keep illegal e-pharmacies in business. The struggle against rogue and fake online pharmacies requires combined efforts at different levels.

Besides the already mentioned “attractive factors”. such as lower prices and anonymity, counterfeiters also use a variety of deceiving methods that are based on the fact that the potential buyers will never have the possibility to verify the authenticity of what is presented in the fake website.    
One of these elements is the logos of genuine online pharmacies, or the approval seal of controlling authorities. Moreover, to reassure potential consumers very often it is requested a medical prescription, as a requisite to purchase the online medicines. 
Thanks to these strategies, the phenomenon of counterfeit medicines sold online is more and more increasing. According to the EAASM&lt;ref&gt;EAASM (2011), When is a medicine not a medicine?, online at http://www.eaasm.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; (European Alliance for Access to safe Medicines) 6 times out of 10, medicines bought online turned to be fakes.

==International cooperation==
With the launch of Operation Pangea&lt;ref&gt;INTERPOL, http://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Pharmaceutical-crime/Operations/Operation-Pangea&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008, for the first time illegal online pharmacies were targeted at the international level. In particular, the operation targeted three main components used by illegal websites: the ISP ([[Internet Service Provider]]), the payment systems and the delivery service.
Along the years the operation gained notable momentum as the number of the participating countries rose from 10 to more than 80 in 2011. The four operations Pangea carried out between 2008 and 2011 led to always increasing number of arrests and seizures all around the world. In 2011 Pangea IV was the largest operation of its kind, involving 165 agencies and leading to the seizure of 2.4 million illicit and counterfeit pills originating from 43 countries; the shutting down of 13,500 websites and the inspection of 45,000 packages.

Due to the almost unlimited possibilities offered by cyberspace, purchasing pharmaceuticals over the Internet is easy while, on the contrary, tracing the various phases within the distribution chain can be difficult. It is for this reason that cooperation among different [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] in different countries becomes essential.

==Role of spam==
Another interesting element to be analyzed is the role of spamming, to present how criminals are able to increase the possibility of success of their deceiving actions by reaching a greater number of potential victims and advertise their products. The term spam is used to describe the abuse of electronic messaging systems in order to indiscriminately send unsolicited bulk messages. The term unsolicited refers to the fact that the message is sent without a verifiable permission granted by the recipient. A message is considered bulk when it is sent as part of a larger collection of messages, all of which have an identical content. ''Spam is a problem of consent, rather than content''. This is a significant element to take into consideration, as attempts to regulate contents of e-mail messages risk to contribute undermining the freedom of speech instead of efficiently fighting the phenomenon of spamming.   
92% to 96% of e-mails received by most organizations are spam.&lt;ref&gt;FIRSTBROOK P. (2007), "Benchmarking Anti-spam Effectiveness", Gartner, September 18th, Securing the Network from Spam, Malware and other Threats. A Strategic Overview Featuring Gartner Content, 3rd issue, Clearswift, available online: http://www.clearswift.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/3674/Clearswift_issue3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Spam volumes around the world reach about 250 billion messages a day, that is to say almost 40 spam e-mail messages a day for each woman, man and child in the world.&lt;ref&gt;"Spam, a lot", The New York Times, published 13 January 2011. Article available here: https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/opinion/14fri4.html?_r=1&amp;ref=spamelectronicmail&lt;/ref&gt;  As it is a cheap and anonymous way to promote products on the Internet and since it also allows reaching a large number of people all over the world, spamming represents a very powerful advertising instrument. It is therefore one of the favorite ways used by organized crime to advertise their illegal activities and illicit products.

Online trade of counterfeit pharmaceuticals does not escape the rule and medicines are by all means among the most spammed online products. In particular, in some cases it is particular easy for spammers to take advantage of consumers’ weaknesses. 
Some of the steps taken by organized criminals to make their operation effective are now presented. 
* Once spammers have decided the product they want to illicit advertise – i.e. the medicine or a series of medicines – their next step is to reach an agreement with a website dealing with that type of medicines. The lists with e-mail addresses to be used as spam recipients are commonly sold between crackers and spammers. Such lists contain million of e-mail addresses, most of which are verified and known to be working.
* To avoid [[anti-spam techniques|anti-spam filters]], based on a list of “dirty words”, the junk e-mails dealing with medicines could simply just contain an image. Since the filters are also designed to protect from certain types of images, the spammers have learnt how to create pictures which do not come out as [[jpeg]] files or similar thus being able to elude filters once again.
* As last step, the spammer only requires a [[software]] designed to send bulk e-mails (i.e. ''[[Dark Mailer]]'')
In the past years several companies settled a series of actions against spammers. The various “joint actions” put in place are an important sign of the determination of the private sector to stop the misuse of the Internet for illegal purposes, nevertheless there are thousand of other smaller companies dealing with spamming on a daily basis that are unable to dispose of such amount of technological, financial and human resources to get engaged in such a fight.

==Involvement of organized crime==
The interest of organized crime towards the illicit trafficking of counterfeit medicines is clearly demonstrated by figures.&lt;ref&gt;For more information on organized crime involvement in counterfeiting activities see also UNICRI (2007), Counterfeiting: a global spread a global threat, chapter 6, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a pill of ecstasy costs between €0.20 and €0.30 and it is generally sold at €5. A [[Viagra]] pill costs around €0.15 and it is sold via an illicit website at around 8 to €10. A kilo of counterfeit Viagra pills (1,700 units) costs €255 and the retail value is from 13,600 to €17,000.

Organized crime is very much involved in the activity of many rogue and fake e-pharmacies all over the Internet, also through the spamming activity. Spamming is usually part of a wider criminal scheme: spam is a powerful advertising tool therefore organized criminals use it in order to expand their market. In this regard organized crime could rather be seen as a veritable illicit enterprise in which spammers hold the role of a sort of an advertising department.

Criminal operations over the Internet are clearly facilitated by the fact that it is indeed easy to register a domain name and to set up a website in a country, to create a back office in another one and to install an online shop in a third country, especially if one considers that many criminal groups operating at the transnational level already have established alliances and operate in several countries. Once the [[online shopping|online shop]] is operational, it could as well easily direct payments to a fourth country and eventually invest the profits in a tax haven. Moreover, very often, in order to further confuse investigators, money is transferred between a chain of bank accounts, creating a smoke-screen which makes investigations more difficult.

As the [[Spanish Civil War]] proceeded on the Northern front (from 1937 onwards), the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republican]] authorities arranged the evacuation of children.

==Evacuations==
These Spanish War children were shipped to Britain, Belgium, the Soviet Union, other European countries and Mexico. These children were referred to as "Basque refugees", but included also non-Basques. They were embarked in Bilbao ([[Santurtzi]]) on boats chartered by the Basque government, loyal to the Republic. Those in Western European countries were able to return to their families after the war,{{Specify|date=April 2016}} but those in the Soviet Union, from Communist families, were forbidden to return – by Stalin and by Franco.  The first opportunity for most of them to do so came in 1956, three years after Stalin's death.  They lived in Soviet orphanages and were regularly transferred from one orphanage to another according to the progress of the Second World War.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}  Thus they experienced the War and its effects on the Soviet Union at first hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n15/curzio-malaparte/the-traitor |title='The Traitor' by Curzio Malaparte, translated by Walter Murch |journal=[[London Review of Books]] |volume=33 |number=15 |pages=32–34 |date=28 July 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stoneham Camp in England=== 
Just under 4,000 children arrived at the Southampton Docks on 23 May 1937. They travelled to Britain on the steamship ''Habana''. The ship had been equipped to accommodate 800 passengers, but this voyage consisted of 3,886 children, 96 teachers, 118 assistants, and 16 Catholic priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.basquechildren.org/reference/passengers|title=Passengers on the 'Habana'|last=Hoare|first=Gerald|date=23 February 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the children and accompanying adults were housed in a single, large refugee camp in [[North Stoneham]], Eastleigh, near Southampton..The camp at North Stoneham had been finished construction only two days prior to their arrival. A local farmer Mr Brown, had provided three of his fields to be used for the Basque children's camp. Work on the camp had begun two weeks before, but the estimated numbers had then been only 2,000, the number was then increased to an expected 4,000. The camp and the sleeping tents were overcrowded. Sanitation was also a problem in the beginning as the children had been living through war and their hygienic habits had been disrupted by their turbulent lives.  Even with the cramped conditions illness was not a large problem within the camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=25367539 |title=Typhoid Fever In The Basque Refugee Camp |first=Richard |last=Taylor |journal=[[The British Medical Journal]] |volume=2 |number=4006 |date=16 October 1937 |pages=760–761 |publisher=BMJ Publishing Group |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The children were under the overall care of the Basque Children's Committee (BCC) part of the [[National Joint Committee for Spanish Relief]] (NJCSR) a cross-party organization that co-ordinated aid to Spain.The plan was to move the refugees out of the camp and disperse them into 'colonies' throughout Britain.  These 'colonies' consisted of groups of children each with an accompanying Spanish teacher and assistants, they were housed in both large and small houses that were lent, or otherwise made available; some colonies were large - a hundred or more children , and some housed only a dozen or so.  By September all of the children were  moved into these colonies. Several hundred were taken in by The Salvation Army, the Catholic Church took about a third of the children, the rest were cared for and supported by many organizations including churches, political  and humanitarian groups, local association, businesses and individuals and other volunteers. As the war in Spain progressed and areas became safer the children started to be repatriated, the first few after barely a month. The Spanish Civil War ended 1 April 1939 to be followed rapidly by and the beginning of the Second World War in September.  By this time only some 400 children remained in Britain, and by 1948 only 280 remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.basquechildren.org/reference/background1948|title=Names of Basque Children (Niños) who remained in Great Britain, 1948|last=Hoare|first=Gerald|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout their stay and the subsequent repatriations those age 16 and above were allowed to decide whether or not they wanted to leave the country. Some had to stay because their parents had been killed or imprisoned, others stayed by choice and made their lives in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basquechildren.org/colonies/history |title=History of the Colonies |website=Basque Children of '37 Association UK |accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Failed SMPS controller IC ISL6251.jpg|thumb|Failed [[integrated circuit|IC]] in a laptop. Wrong input voltage has caused massive overheating of the chip and melted the plastic casing.]]

'''Electronic components''' have a wide range of '''[[failure mode]]s'''. These can be classified in various ways, such as by time or cause. Failures can be caused by excess temperature, excess current or voltage, [[ionizing radiation]], mechanical shock, stress or impact, and many other causes. In semiconductor devices, problems in the device package may cause failures due to contamination, mechanical stress of the device, or open or short circuits.

Failures most commonly occur near the beginning and near the ending of the lifetime of the parts, resulting in the [[bathtub curve]] graph of [[failure rate]]s.  [[Burn-in]] procedures are used to detect early failures. In semiconductor devices, [[parasitic structure]]s, irrelevant for normal operation, become important in the context of failures; they can be both a source and protection against failure.

Applications such as aerospace systems, life support systems, telecommunications, railway signals, and computers use great numbers of individual electronic components. Analysis of the statistical properties of failures can give guidance in designs to establish a given level of reliability. For example, power-handling ability of a resistor may be greatly derated when applied in high-altitude aircraft to obtain adequate service life.
A sudden fail-open fault can cause multiple secondary failures if it is fast and the circuit contains an [[inductance]]; this causes large voltage spikes, which may exceed 500 volts. A broken metallisation on a chip may thus cause secondary overvoltage damage.&lt;ref name="istfa2001"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-jlSjurXBc0C&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=resistor+failure&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=16#v=onepage&amp;q=resistor%20failure&amp;f=false STFA 2001: proceedings of the 27th International Symposium for Testing and Failure Analysis]: 11–15 November 2001, Santa Clara Convention Center, Santa Clara, California, p. 267 {{ISBN|0-87170-746-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thermal runaway]] can cause sudden failures including melting, fire or explosions.

==Packaging failures==
&lt;!-- This section seems to be written primarily about failure modes of military hermetic components but don't really apply to most modern electronics which are plastic, ie glass metal interfaces and atmosphere within cavities are not found in most modern electronics --&gt;
The majority of electronic parts failures are [[electronic packaging|packaging]]-related.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Packaging, as the barrier between electronic parts and the environment, is very susceptible to environmental factors. [[Thermal expansion]] produces mechanical stresses that may cause [[material fatigue]], especially when the thermal expansion coefficients of the materials are different. Humidity and aggressive chemicals can cause corrosion of the packaging materials and leads, potentially breaking them and damaging the inside parts, leading to electrical failure. Exceeding the allowed environmental temperature range can cause overstressing of wire bonds, thus tearing the connections loose, cracking the semiconductor dies, or causing packaging cracks. Humidity and subsequent high temperature heating may also cause cracking, as may mechanical damage or shock.

During encapsulation, bonding wires can be severed, shorted, or touch the chip die, usually at the edge. Dies can crack due to mechanical overstress or thermal shock; defects introduced during processing, like scribing, can develop into fractures. Lead frames may contain excessive material or burrs, causing shorts. Ionic contaminants like [[alkali metal]]s and [[halogen]]s can migrate from the packaging materials to the semiconductor dies, causing corrosion or parameter deterioration. Glass-metal seals commonly fail by forming radial cracks that originate at the pin-glass interface and permeate outwards; other causes include a weak oxide layer on the interface and poor formation of a glass meniscus around the pin.&lt;ref name="elecmatpack"/&gt;

Various gases may be present in the package cavity, either as impurities trapped during manufacturing, [[outgassing]] of the materials used, or chemical reactions, as is when the packaging material gets overheated (the products are often ionic and facilitate corrosion with delayed failure). To detect this, [[helium]] is often in the inert atmosphere inside the packaging as a [[tracer gas]] to detect leaks during testing. Carbon dioxide and hydrogen may form from organic materials, moisture is outgassed by polymers and amine-cured epoxies outgas [[ammonia]]. Formation of cracks and intermetallic growth in die attachments may lead to formation of voids and delamination, impairing heat transfer from the chip die to the substrate and heatsink and causing a thermal failure. As some semiconductors like silicon and [[gallium arsenide]] are infrared-transparent, infrared microscopy can check the integrity of die bonding and under-die structures.&lt;ref name="elecmatpack"/&gt;

[[Red phosphorus]], used as a charring-promoter [[flame retardant]], facilitates silver migration when present in packaging. It is normally coated with [[aluminium hydroxide]]; if the coating is incomplete, the phosphorus particles oxidize to the highly [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] [[phosphorus pentoxide]], which reacts with moisture to [[phosphoric acid]]. This is a corrosive electrolyte that in the presence of electric fields facilitates dissolution and migration of silver, short-circuiting adjacent packaging pins, [[lead frame]] leads, tie bars, chip mount structures, and chip pads. The silver bridge may be interrupted by thermal expansion of the package; thus, disappearance of the shorting when the chip is heated and its reappearance after cooling is an indication of this problem.&lt;ref name="istfa2008"/&gt; Delamination and thermal expansion may move the chip die relative to the packaging, deforming and possibly shorting or cracking the bonding wires.&lt;ref name="istfa2001"/&gt;

==Contact failures==
Soldered joints can fail in many ways like [[electromigration]] and formation of brittle [[intermetallic]] layers. Some failures show only at extreme joint temperatures, hindering troubleshooting. Thermal expansion mismatch between the printed circuit board material and its packaging strains the part-to-board bonds; while leaded parts can absorb the strain by bending, leadless parts rely on the solder to absorb stresses. Thermal cycling may lead to fatigue cracking of the solder joints, especially with [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] solders; various approaches are used to mitigate such incidents. Loose particles, like bonding wire and weld flash, can form in the device cavity and migrate inside the packaging, causing often intermittent and shock-sensitive shorts. Corrosion may cause buildup of oxides and other nonconductive products on the contact surfaces. When closed, these then show unacceptably high resistance; they may also migrate and cause shorts.&lt;ref name="elecmatpack"/&gt; [[Tin whisker]]s can form on tin-coated metals like the internal side of the packagings; loose whiskers then can cause intermittent short circuits inside the packaging. [[Electrical cable|Cables]], in addition to the methods described above, may fail by fraying and fire damage.

==Printed circuit board failures==
[[File:PCB corrosion.jpg|thumb|right|Severe PCB corrosion from a leaky PCB mounted Ni-Cd battery]]
[[Printed circuit board]]s (PCBs) are vulnerable to environmental influences; for example, the traces are corrosion-prone and may be improperly etched leaving partial shorts, while the [[via (electronics)|vias]] may be insufficiently plated through or filled with solder. The traces may crack under mechanical loads, often resulting in unreliable PCB operation. Residues of solder flux may facilitate corrosion; those of other materials on PCBs can cause electrical leaks. Polar covalent compounds can attract moisture like [[antistatic agent]]s, forming a thin layer of conductive moisture between the traces; ionic compounds like [[chloride]]s tend to facilitate corrosion. Alkali metal ions may migrate through plastic packaging and influence the functioning of semiconductors. [[Chlorinated hydrocarbon]] residues may [[hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] and release corrosive chlorides; these are problems that occur after years. Polar molecules may dissipate high-frequency energy, causing parasitic [[dielectric loss]]es.

Above the [[glass transition temperature]] of PCBs, the resin matrix softens and becomes susceptible contaminant diffusion. For example, polyglycols from the [[flux (metallurgy)|solder flux]] can enter the board and increase its humidity intake, with corresponding deterioration of dielectric and corrosion properties.&lt;ref name="lfreli"&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dOFYjXIDm9YC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=solder+flux+rosin#v=onepage&amp;q=solder%20flux%20rosin&amp;f=false | title = Lead-free solder interconnect reliability | isbn = 978-0-87170-816-8 | author1 = Shangguan | first1 = Dongkai | date = 2005-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multilayer substrates using ceramics suffer from many of the same problems.

[[Conductive anodic filament]]s (CAFs) may grow within the boards along the fibers of the composite material. Metal is introduced to a vulnerable surface typically from plating the vias, then migrates in presence of ions, moisture, and electrical potential; drilling damage and poor glass-resin bonding promotes such failures.&lt;ref name="micelfailanal"/&gt; The formation of CAFs usually begins by poor glass-resin bonding; a layer of adsorbed moisture then provides a channel through which ions and corrosion products migrate. In presence of chloride ions, the precipitated material is [[atacamite]]; its semiconductive properties lead to increased current leakage, deteriorated dielectric strength, and short circuits between traces. Absorbed glycols from flux residues aggravate the problem. The difference in thermal expansion of the fibers and the matrix weakens the bond when the board is soldered; the lead-free solders which require higher soldering temperatures increase the occurrence of CAFs. Besides this, CAFs depend on absorbed humidity; below a certain threshold, they do not occur.&lt;ref name="lfreli"/&gt; Delamination may occur to separate the board layers, cracking the vias and conductors to introduce pathways for corrosive contaminants and migration of conductive species.&lt;ref name="micelfailanal"/&gt;

==Relay failures==

Every time the contacts of an electromechanical [[relay]] or [[contactor]] are opened or closed, there is a certain amount of [[Contact protection#Contact wear|contact wear]]. An [[electric arc]] occurs between the contact points (electrodes) both during the transition from closed to open (break) or from open to closed (make). The arc caused during the contact break (break arc) is akin to [[arc welding]], as the break arc is typically more energetic and more destructive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | publisher = Springer-Verlag, Berlin / Göttingen / Heidelberg

 | isbn =
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heat and current of the electrical arc across the contacts creates specific cone &amp; crater formations from metal migration. In addition to the physical contact damage, there appears also a coating of carbon and other matter. This degradation drastically limits the overall operating life of a relay or contactor to a range of perhaps 100,000 operations, a level representing 1% or less than the mechanical life expectancy of the same device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lab Note #105 ''Contact Life - Unsuppressed vs. Suppressed Arcing'' | publisher = Arc Suppression Technologies | date = August 2011 | url = http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/ | accessdate = March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semiconductor failures==
{{See also|Reliability (semiconductor)}}

Many failures result in generation of [[hot electron]]s. These are observable under an optical microscope, as they generate near-[[infrared]] photons detectable by a [[CCD camera]]. [[Latchup]]s can be observed this way.&lt;ref name="micfailanal"/&gt; If visible, the location of failure may present clues to the nature of the overstress. Liquid crystal coatings can be used for localization of faults: cholesteric liquid crystals are [[thermochromic]] and are used for visualisation of locations of heat production on the chips, while nematic liquid crystals respond to voltage and are used for visualising current leaks through oxide defects and of charge states on the chip surface (particularly logical states).&lt;ref name="elecmatpack"/&gt; Laser marking of plastic-encapsulated packages may damage the chip if glass spheres in the packaging line up and direct the laser to the chip.&lt;ref name="istfa2008"/&gt;

Examples of semiconductor failures relating to semiconductor crystals include:
* [[Nucleation]] and growth of [[dislocation]]s. This requires an existing defect in the crystal, as is done by radiation, and is accelerated by heat, high current density and emitted light. With LEDs, [[gallium arsenide]] and [[aluminium gallium arsenide]] are more susceptible to this than [[gallium arsenide phosphide]] and [[indium phosphide]]; [[gallium nitride]] and [[indium gallium nitride]] are insensitive to this defect.
* Accumulation of [[charge carrier]]s trapped in the [[gate oxide]] of [[MOSFET]]s. This introduces permanent gate [[biasing]], influencing the transistor's threshold voltage; it may be caused by [[hot carrier injection]], [[ionizing radiation]] or nominal use. With [[EEPROM]] cells, this is the major factor limiting the number of erase-write cycles.
* Migration of charge carriers from [[floating gate]]s. This limits the lifetime of stored data in [[EEPROM]] and flash EPROM structures.
* Improper passivation. [[Corrosion]] is a significant source of delayed failures; semiconductors, metallic interconnects, and passivation glasses are all susceptible. The surface of semiconductors subjected to moisture has an oxide layer; the liberated hydrogen reacts with deeper layers of the material, yielding volatile [[hydride]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lg8ZuZPYG5oC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=semiconductor+failure+microphotograph&amp;cd=41#v=onepage&amp;q=|page=251 |title=Corrosion and reliability of electronic materials and devices: proceedings of the Fourth International Symposium|publisher=The Electrochemical Society|year=1999|isbn=1-56677-252-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parameter failures===
[[Via (electronics)|Vias]] are a common source of unwanted serial resistance on chips; defective vias show unacceptably high resistance and therefore increase propagation delays. As their resistivity drops with increasing temperature, degradation of the maximum operating frequency of the chip the other way is an indicator of such a fault. ''Mousebites'' are regions where metallization has a decreased width; such defects usually do not show during electrical testing but present a major reliability risk. Increased current density in the mousebite can aggravate electromigration problems; a large degree of voiding is needed to create a temperature-sensitive propagation delay.&lt;ref name="micfailanal"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MyVHpqi1SXwC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=esd+junction+failure&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=13#v=onepage&amp;q=esd%20junction%20failure&amp;f=false Microelectronics failure analysis: desk reference] By Electronic Device Failure Analysis Society. Desk Reference Committee, ASM International, 2004 {{ISBN|0-87170-804-3}} p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, circuit tolerances can make erratic behaviour difficult to trace; for example, a weak driver transistor, a higher series resistance and the capacitance of the gate of the subsequent transistor may be within tolerance but can significantly increase signal [[propagation delay]]. These can manifest only at specific environmental conditions, high clock speeds, low power supply voltages, and sometimes specific circuit signal states; significant variations can occur on a single die.&lt;ref name="micfailanal"/&gt; Overstress-induced damage like ohmic shunts or a reduced transistor output current can increase such delays, leading to erratic behavior. As propagation delays depend heavily on supply voltage, tolerance-bound fluctuations of the latter can trigger such behavior.

[[Gallium arsenide]] [[monolithic microwave integrated circuit]]s can have these failures:&lt;ref name="nasammic4"&gt;[http://parts.jpl.nasa.gov/mmic/4.PDF Chapter 4. Basic Failure Modes and Mechanisms], S. Kayali&lt;/ref&gt;
* Degradation of I&lt;sub&gt;DSS&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="I_DSS"&gt;[http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/What-is-IDSS-of-a-FET-transistor What is IDSS of a FET Transistor?]&lt;/ref&gt; by gate sinking and [[hydrogen]] poisoning. This failure is the most common and easiest to detect, and is affected by reduction of the active channel of the transistor in gate sinking and depletion of the donor density in the active channel for hydrogen poisoning.
* Degradation in gate [[leakage current]]. This occurs at accelerated life tests or high temperatures and is suspected to be caused by surface-state effects.
* Degradation in [[Threshold voltage|pinch-off voltage]]. This is a common failure mode for gallium arsenide devices operating at high temperature, and primarily stems from semiconductor-metal interactions and degradation of gate metal structures, with hydrogen being another reason. It can be hindered by a suitable [[barrier metal]] between the contacts and gallium arsenide.
* Increase in drain-to-source resistance. It is observed in high-temperature devices, and is caused by metal-semiconductor interactions, gate sinking and ohmic contact degradation.

===Metallisation failures===
[[File:Failed transistor.jpg|thumb|right|Micro-photograph of a failed TO3 power transistor due to short circuit]]
Metallisation failures are more common and serious causes of FET transistor degradation than material processes; [[amorphous]] materials have no grain boundaries, hindering interdiffusion and corrosion.&lt;ref name="semidevrel"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZW83tWdamvgC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=semiconductor+failure+microphotograph&amp;cd=12#v=onepage&amp;q= |page=221|title=Semiconductor device reliability |author1=A. Christou |author2=B. A. Unger |publisher=Springer|year=1990|isbn=0-7923-0536-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such failures include:
* [[Electromigration]] moving atoms out of active regions, causing dislocations and point defects acting as nonradiative recombination centers producing heat. This may occur with aluminium gates in [[MESFET]]s with [[radio frequency|RF]] signals, causing erratic drain current; electromigration in this case is called ''gate sinking''. This issue does not occur with gold gates.&lt;ref name="semidevrel"/&gt; With structures having aluminium over a refractory metal barrier, electromigration primarily affects aluminium but not the refractory metal, causing the structure's resistance to erratically increase. Displaced aluminium may cause shorts to neighbouring structures; 0.5-4% of [[copper]] in the aluminium increases electromigration resistance, the copper accumulating on the alloy grain boundaries and increasing the energy needed to dislodge atoms from them.&lt;ref name="analogart"/&gt; Other than that, [[indium tin oxide]] and silver are subject to electromigration, causing leakage current and (in LEDs) [[nonradiative recombination]] along chip edges. In all cases, electromigration can cause changes in dimensions and parameters of the transistor gates and semiconductor junctions.
* Mechanical stresses, high currents, and corrosive environments forming of [[whisker (metallurgy)|whiskers]] and short circuits. These effects can occur both within packaging and on [[circuit board]]s.
* Formation of silicon nodules. Aluminium interconnects may be silicon-doped to saturation during deposition to prevent alloy spikes. During thermal cycling, the silicon atoms may migrate and clump together forming nodules that act as voids, increasing local resistance and lowering device lifetime.&lt;ref name="elecmatpack"/&gt;
* [[Ohmic contact]] degradation between metallisation and semiconductor layers. With gallium arsenide, a layer of gold-germanium alloy (sometimes with nickel) is used to achieve low contact resistance; an ohmic contact is formed by diffusion of germanium, forming a thin, highly n-doped region under the metal facilitating the connection, leaving gold deposited over it. Gallium atoms may migrate through this layer and get scavenged by the gold above, creating a defect-rich gallium-depleted zone under the contact; gold and oxygen then migrate oppositely, resulting in increased resistance of the ohmic contact and depletion of effective doping level.&lt;ref name="semidevrel"/&gt; Formation of [[intermetallic]] compounds also plays a role in this failure mode.

===Electrical overstress===
Most stress-related semiconductor failures are electrothermal in nature microscopically; locally increased temperatures can lead to immediate failure by melting or vaporising metallisation layers, melting the semiconductor or by changing structures. Diffusion and electromigration tend to be accelerated by high temperatures, shortening the lifetime of the device; damage to junctions not leading to immediate failure may manifest as altered [[current-voltage characteristic]]s of the junctions. Electrical overstress failures can be classified as thermally-induced, electromigration-related and electric field-related failures; examples of such failures include:
* [[Thermal runaway]], where clusters in the substrate cause localised loss of [[thermal conductivity]], leading to damage producing more heat; the most common causes are voids caused by incomplete [[soldering]], electromigration effects and [[Kirkendall voiding]]. Clustered distribution of current density over the junction or [[current filament]]s lead to [[current crowding]] localised hot spots, which may evolve to a thermal runaway.
* [[Reverse bias]]. Some semiconductor devices are diode junction-based and are nominally rectifiers; however, the reverse-breakdown mode may be at a very low voltage, with a moderate reverse bias voltage causing immediate degradation and vastly accelerated failure. 5&amp;nbsp;V is a maximum reverse-bias voltage for typical LEDs, with some types having lower figures.
* Severely overloaded [[Zener diode]]s in reverse bias shorting. A sufficiently high voltage causes avalanche breakdown of the Zener junction; that and a large current being passed through the diode causes extreme localised heating, melting the junction and metallisation and forming a silicon-aluminium alloy that shorts the terminals. This is sometimes intentionally used as a method of hardwiring connections via fuses.&lt;ref name="analogart"/&gt;
* [[Latchup]]s (when the device is subjected to an over- or undervoltage pulse); a [[parasitic structure]] acting as a triggered [[Silicon-controlled rectifier|SCR]] then may cause an overcurrent-based failure. In ICs, latchups are classified as internal (like [[transmission line]] reflections and [[ground bounce]]s) or external (like signals introduced via I/O pins and [[cosmic ray]]s); external latchups can be triggered by an electrostatic discharge while internal latchups cannot. Latchups can be triggered by charge carriers injected into chip substrate or another latchup; the [[JEDEC78]] standard tests susceptibility to latchups.&lt;ref name="micfailanal"/&gt;

====Electrostatic discharge====
{{Main article|Electrostatic discharge}}
Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is a subclass of electrical overstress and may cause immediate device failure, permanent parameter shifts and latent damage causing increased degradation rate. It has at least one of three components, localized heat generation, high current density and high electric field gradient; prolonged presence of currents of several amperes transfer energy to the device structure to cause damage. ESD in real circuits causes a [[damped wave]] with rapidly alternating polarity, the junctions stressed in the same manner; it has four basic mechanisms:&lt;ref name="esdprotcmos"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=L4BI1wjbgBUC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=esd+junction+failure&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=10#v=onepage&amp;q=esd%20junction%20failure&amp;f=false ESD protection device and circuit design for advanced CMOS technologies] By Oleg Semenov, Hossein Sarbishaei, Manoj Sachdev, Springer, 2008, p. 4 {{ISBN|1-4020-8300-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Oxide breakdown occurring at field strengths above 6–10&amp;nbsp;MV/cm.
* Junction damage manifesting as reverse-bias leakage increases to the point of shorting.
* Metallisation and polysilicon burnout, where damage is limited to metal and [[polysilicon]] interconnects, thin film resistors and diffused resistors.
* Charge injection, where hot carriers generated by avalanche breakdown are injected into the oxide layer.

Catastrophic ESD failure modes include:
* Junction burnout, where a conductive path forms through the junction and shorts it
* Metallisation burnout, where melting or vaporizing of a part of the metal interconnect interrupts it
* Oxide punch-through, formation of a conductive path through the insulating layer between two conductors or semiconductors; the [[gate oxide]]s are thinnest and therefore most sensitive. The damaged transistor shows a low-ohmic junction between gate and drain terminals.

A parametric failure only shifts the device parameters and may manifest in [[stress testing]]; sometimes, the degree of damage can lower over time. Latent ESD failure modes occur in a delayed fashion and include:
* Insulator damage by weakening of the insulator structures.
* Junction damage by lowering minority carrier lifetimes, increasing forward-bias resistance and increasing reverse-bias leakage.
* Metallisation damage by conductor weakening.

Catastrophic failures require the highest discharge voltages, are the easiest to test for and are rarest to occur. Parametric failures occur at intermediate discharge voltages and occur more often, with latent failures the most common. For each parametric failure, there are 4–10 latent ones.&lt;ref name="contesd"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CP4hdPlAmzYC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=esd+junction+failure&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=esd%20junction%20failure|page=68 |title=Contamination and ESD control in high-technology manufacturing|author1=R. W. Welker |author2=Ramamurthy Nagarajan |author3=Carl E. Newberg |publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2006|isbn=0-471-41452-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[VLSI]] circuits are more ESD-sensitive, with smaller features, lower capacitance and higher voltage-to-charge ratio. Silicon deposition of the conductive layers makes them more conductive, reducing the ballast resistance that has a protective role.

The [[gate oxide]] of some [[MOSFET]]s can be damaged by 50 volts of potential, the gate isolated from the junction and potential accumulating on it causing extreme stress on the thin dielectric layer; stressed oxide can shatter and fail immediately. The gate oxide itself does not fail immediately but can be accelerated by [[stress induced leakage current]], the oxide damage leading to a delayed failure after prolonged operation hours; on-chip capacitors using oxide or nitride dielectrics are also vulnerable. Smaller structures are more vulnerable because of their lower [[capacitance]], meaning the same amount of charge carriers charges the capacitor to a higher voltage. All thin layers of dielectrics are vulnerable; hence, chips made by processes employing thicker oxide layers are less vulnerable.&lt;ref name="analogart"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRmTP6puA3oC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=esd+junction+failure&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=esd%20junction%20failure|page=120|author=黑斯廷斯 |title=The art of analog layout|publisher=清华大学出版社|year=2004|isbn=7-302-08226-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current-induced failures are more common in bipolar junction devices, where Schottky and PN junctions are predominant. The high power of the discharge, above 5 kilowatts for less than a microsecond, can melt and vaporise materials. Thin-film resistors may have their value altered by a discharge path forming across them, or having part of the thin film vaporized; this can be problematic in precision applications where such values are critical.&lt;ref name="esdaz"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDENBxWoSQwC&amp;pg=PA32|page=32 |title=ESD from A to Z: electrostatic discharge control for electronics|author1=John M. Kolyer |author2=Donald E. Watson |publisher=Springer|year=1996|isbn=0-412-08381-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newer CMOS [[output buffer]]s using lightly doped [[silicide]] drains are more ESD sensitive; the N-channel driver usually suffers damage in the oxide layer or n+/p well junction. This is  caused by current crowding during the snapback of the parasitic NPN transistor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guHeExcizZwC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=esd+junction+failure&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=esd%20junction%20failure|page=67 |title=Esd Program Management: A Realistic Approach to Continuous Measurable Improvement in Static Control|author=G. Theodore|publisher=Springer|year=1990|isbn=0-412-09781-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In P/NMOS totem-pole structures, the NMOS transistor is almost always the one damaged.&lt;ref name="modeleosic"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1DQFoNRHHdAC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=esd+junction+failure&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=12#v=onepage&amp;q=esd%20junction%20failure&amp;f=false Modeling of electrical overstress in integrated circuits] By Carlos Hernando Díaz, Sung-Mo Kang, Charvaka Duvvury, Springer,1995, p. 3 {{ISBN|0-7923-9505-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of the junction influences its ESD sensitivity; corners and defects can lead to current crowding, reducing the damage threshold. Forward-biased junctions are less sensitive than reverse-biased ones because the [[Joule heat]] of forward-biased junctions is dissipated through a thicker layer of the material, as compared to the narrow depletion region in reverse-biased junction.&lt;ref name="relifail"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxSyMjosCwcC&amp;pg=PA349&amp;dq=esd+junction+failure&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=esd%20junction%20failure |title=Reliability and failure of electronic materials and devices|author=Milton Ohring|page=349|publisher=Academic Press|year=1998|isbn=0-12-524985-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistors===
{{Main article|Resistor#Failure modes|l1=Failure modes of resistors}}
[[File:Resistor damaged arcing.jpg|thumb|right|A resistor removed from a high voltage tube circuit shows damage from voltaic arcing on the resistive metal oxide layer.]]
Resistors can fail open or short, alongside their value changing under environmental conditions and outside performance limits. Examples of resistor failures include:
* Manufacturing defects causing intermittent problems. For example, improperly crimped caps on carbon or metal resistors can loosen and lose contact, and the resistor-to-cap resistance can change the values of the resistor&lt;ref name="elecmatpack"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c2YxCCaM9RIC&amp;pg=PA970&amp;dq=resistor+failure&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=resistor%20failure&amp;f=false Electronic Materials Handbook: Packaging] By Merrill L.

====Potentiometers and trimmers====
[[Potentiometer]]s and [[trimmer (electronics)|trimmers]] are three-terminal electromechanical parts, containing a resistive path with an adjustable wiper contact. Along with the failure modes for normal resistors, mechanical wear on the wiper and the resistive layer, corrosion, surface contamination, and mechanical deformations may lead to intermittent path-wiper resistance changes, which are a problem with audio amplifiers. Many types are not perfectly sealed, with contaminants and moisture entering the part; an especially common contaminant is the [[solder flux]]. Mechanical deformations (like an impaired wiper-path contact) can occur by housing warpage during soldering or mechanical stress during mounting. Excess stress on leads can cause substrate cracking and open failure when the crack penetrates the resistive path.&lt;ref name="elecmatpack"/&gt;

===Capacitors===
{{main article|Capacitor}}
Capacitors are characterized by their [[capacitance]], parasitic resistance in series and parallel, [[breakdown voltage]] and [[dissipation factor]]; both parasitic parameters are often frequency- and voltage-dependent. Structurally, capacitors consist of electrodes separated by a dielectric, connecting leads, and housing; deterioration of any of these may cause parameter shifts or failure. Shorted failures and leakage due to increase of parallel parasitic resistance are the most common failure modes of capacitors, followed by open failures.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Some examples of capacitor failures include:
* [[Dielectric breakdown]] due to overvoltage or aging of the dielectric, occurring when breakdown voltage falls below operating voltage. Some types of capacitors "self-heal", as internal arcing vaporizes parts of the electrodes around the failed spot.  Others form a conductive pathway through the dielectric, leading to shorting or partial loss of dielectric resistance.&lt;ref name="elecmatpack"/&gt;
* Electrode materials migrating across the dielectric, forming conductive paths.&lt;ref name="elecmatpack"/&gt;
* Leads separated from the capacitor by rough handling during storage, assembly or operation, leading to an open failure. The failure can occur invisibly inside the packaging and is measurable.&lt;ref name="elecmatpack"/&gt;
* Increase of [[dissipation factor]] due to contamination of capacitor materials, particularly from flux and solvent residues.&lt;ref name="elecmatpack"/&gt;

====Electrolytic capacitors====
In addition to the problems listed above, [[electrolytic capacitor]]s suffer from these failures:
* Aluminium versions having their electrolyte dry out for a gradual leakage, equivalent series resistance and loss of capacitance. Power dissipation by high ripple currents and internal resistances cause an increase of the capacitor's internal temperature beyond specifications, accelerating the deterioration rate; such capacitors usually fail short.&lt;ref name="elecmatpack"/&gt;
* Electrolyte contamination (like from moisture) corroding the electrodes, leading to capacitance loss and shorts.&lt;ref name="elecmatpack"/&gt;
* Electrolytes evolving a gas, increasing pressure inside the capacitor housing and sometimes causing an explosion; an example is the [[capacitor plague]].{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
* [[Tantalum capacitor|Tantalum versions]] being electrically overstressed, permanently degrading the dielectric and sometimes causing open or short failure.&lt;ref name="elecmatpack"/&gt; Sites that have failed this way are usually visible as a discolored dielectric or as a locally melted anode.&lt;ref name="micelfailanal"/&gt;

===Metal oxide varistors===
{{Main article|Varistor}}

Metal oxide [[varistor]]s typically have lower resistance as they heat up; if connected directly across a power bus, for protection against [[electrical transient]]s, a varistor with a lowered trigger voltage can slide into catastrophic thermal runaway and sometimes a small explosion or fire.&lt;ref name=Brown2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Kenneth|title=Metal Oxide Varistor Degradation|journal=IAEI Magazine|date=March 2004|url=http://www.iaei.org/magazine/2004/03/metal-oxide-varistor-degradation/|accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent this, the fault current is typically limited by a thermal fuse, circuit breaker, or other current limiting device.

==MEMS failures==
[[Microelectromechanical systems]] suffer from various types of failures:
* [[Stiction]] causing moving parts to stick; an external impulse sometimes restores functionality. Non-stick coatings, reduction of contact area, and increased awareness mitigate the problem in contemporary systems.&lt;ref name="micfailanal"/&gt;
* Particles migrating in the system and blocking their movements. Conductive particles may short out circuits like electrostatic actuators. [[Wear]] damages the surfaces and releases debris that can be a source of particle contamination.
* [[Fracture]]s causing loss of mechanical parts.
* [[Material fatigue]] inducing cracks in moving structures.
* Dielectric charging leading to change of functionality and at some point parameter failures.&lt;ref name="memsdielcharging"/&gt;

==Recreating failure modes==
In order to reduce failures, a precise knowledge of bond strength quality measurement during product design and subsequent manufacture is of vital importance. The best place to start is with the failure mode. This is based on the assumption that there is a particular failure mode, or range of modes, that may occur within a product. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the bond test should replicate the mode, or modes of interest. However, exact replication is not always possible. The test load must be applied to some part of the sample and transferred through the sample to the bond. If this part of the sample is the only option and is weaker than the bond itself, the sample will fail before the bond.&lt;ref name="sykes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xyztec.com/bondtesting/ |title=Why test bonds? |first=Bob |last=Sykes |publisher=Global SMT &amp; Packaging magazine |date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gaian Variations''''' is an environmental oratorio by classical composer [[Nathan Currier]], an abruptly terminated premiere of which took place at [[Avery Fisher Hall]], Lincoln Center, New York on April 21, 2004. 

The work is about the [[Gaia hypothesis]] of [[James Lovelock]]. Currier spent several years writing the large work; he felt that the urgency of climate change made raising awareness of Gaia theory important, and since the failed premiere has given talks on climate change for Al Gore’s [[The Climate Project]]. When two institutions involved in the premiere, the [[Brooklyn Philharmonic]] and [[Earth Day Network]], failed to raise the funds needed, Currier used personal funds to prevent its cancellation. 

During the premiere, the Brooklyn Philharmonic orchestra suddenly stopped in the midst of the performance. The orchestra claimed it was headed into overtime, although Currier has disputed that in a lawsuit filed over the event. Allan Kozinn, at the time music critic for the ''New York Times'' said that the composer “seemed unable to end the work,” claimed that the texts were “pseudoscientific,” and harshly criticized the composition. Prominent American composer John Corigliano, also a board member of the Brooklyn Philharmonic, said on the other hand that Gaian Variations was “Just beautiful. Very, very skilled work, and very inspired too.” Currier was given a pro bono lawyer through [[Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts]] shortly after the performance. The Executive Vice President and Director of the Hess Oil Company,  J. Barclay Collins II, also a client of the same firm and Chairman of the Board of the Brooklyn Philharmonic, complained to the law firm, and Currier lost legal representation. On the ''New York Times'' Arts Beat Blog, Collins (who retired in January 2010 from the multi-billion dollar company) was also quoted as saying that Currier’s lawsuit was "totally without merit."&lt;ref name="Wakin"&gt;Wakin, Daniel J. (April 17, 2009). [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/nathan-currier/ "Brooklyn Philharmonic Cancels Concerts"]. ''New York Times'' Arts Beat Blog.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2008 Currier was represented by [[Alex Roshuk|Alex T. Roshuk]], and the case was filed against the orchestra in Supreme Court of the State of New York, Kings County, in 2009. 

An archival website about Gaian Variations and its premiere, gaianvariations.com, still exists. in the book ''Back to Darwin: A Richer Account of Evolution'', by John B. Cobb (Eerdmans, 2008), Currier's Gaian Variations was discussed.  In noting how a Gaia-oriented view might be beginning to spread around the world, Cobb wrote that, “The very existence of the new oratorio by Nathan Currier supports my hope.”

A '''[[garden]] / [[flora]] festival or exposition''' is a [[festival]] and [[Trade fair|exposition]] held to celebrate the [[art]]s of [[gardening]], [[garden design]], [[landscaping]] and [[landscape architecture]]. There are local garden festivals, regional garden festivals, [[National Garden Festival]]s and [[International Garden Festival]]s. The idea probably originated with Germany's [[Bundesgartenschau]]. The UK held five garden festivals in the period 1984-92 but blundered through not planning an after-use for the festival grounds during their design and planning phase.

To qualify as an International Exhibition, an Expo must be recognised by the [[Bureau International des Expositions]] (BIE), which was established by a diplomatic international Convention, signed in Paris, in 1928. Horticultural Expos can also be recognised by the [[AIPH|International Association of Horticultural Producers]] (IAHP / AIPH). To qualify as a National Exhibition, a garden festival must be recognised by a national government.

Because [[garden design]] is becoming more popular and featuring on TV, there is an ever-growing number of garden festivals: permanent and temporary, official and non-official. One of the best known is International Garden Festival held on a permanent site at Chaumont in France. Despite the name, Chaumont does not come within the BIE definition of an 'international' festival. Other shows feature garden design but describe themselves as 'flower shows'.  The best-known example in this category, the [[Chelsea Flower Show]], emphasises [[garden design]].  It spun off a [[Chelsea Fringe]] events in 2012 which featured a variety of unusual gardens and gardening across London.

[[File:Cinema around the world.jpg|right|thumb|Cinema tent at the 2006 Big Green Gathering]]
The '''Green Gathering''', formerly known as the '''Big Green Gathering''' is an award winning [[festival]] with an environmental and social justice focus, including workshops and talks on permaculture, politics, ecology and crafts, as well as art, live music and spoken word performances. The first Big Green Gathering was held in 1994 and the festival is currently held in [[Chepstow]], [[Monmouthshire]] although it has previously been held in various locations in [[Somerset]] and [[Wiltshire]], [[England]].

==History==
The event grew from the Green Fields area of the [[Glastonbury Festival]].&lt;ref name="mendiptimes"&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Mark Adler |date=August 2006 | title = It's my party | journal = Mendip Times | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 14–15 | id = | url = http://www.mendiptimes.co.uk/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
And in their turn, the Green Fields at Glastonbury Festival had evolved from an earlier series of Green Gatherings held from the late 1970s until 1983 at two Somerset venues, some being formally associated with the Ecology Party, as the UK [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] was then named.

The first Big Green Gathering was held in 1994 at [[Watchfield]], north east of [[Swindon]].&lt;ref name="safe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safeconcerts.com/festivals/finished%20festivals/biggreengathering.asp|title=The big green gathering|publisher=Safeconcerts.com|accessdate=2008-08-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080720064301/http://www.safeconcerts.com/festivals/finished%20festivals/biggreengathering.asp| archivedate= 20 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the event moved to a site at [[Pertwood|Lower Pertwood Farm]], about 10&amp;nbsp;miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) south of [[Warminster]], in [[Wiltshire]], and the event was repeated at that site in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2000.&lt;ref name="safe"/&gt; The next Green Gathering took place in 2002 at Winchester Farm on the [[Somerset Levels]] in [[Cheddar, Somerset|Cheddar]]. In 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2007 the BGG was held at Fernhill Farm, a 160-acre (65&amp;nbsp;hectare) site which can hold up to 20,000 visitors, in the [[Mendip Hills]]. No festival was held in 2008 due to financial problems.

In 2009 the festival was scheduled to return to Fernhill Farm, 29 July to 2 August. Mendip council granted a licence at the end of June. According to The Guardian: "On 23 July, the organisers were suddenly confronted with a list of demands that they believed they had already met".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is the Big Green Gathering another victim of the crackdown on dissent?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/aug/03/green-activism-police-licence|website=The Guardian|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days before it was due to open, the organisers surrendered their licence to hold the event, following the threat of injunction proceedings in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] by [[Mendip District Council]], supported by [[Avon and Somerset Police]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jul/26/big-green-festival-cancelled Big Green Gathering festival cancelled at last minute] [[The Guardian]] 26 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cameron |first=Alex|title= Somerset's Big Green Gathering festival cancelled|url=http://www.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/news/4513788.Somerset_s_Big_Green_Gathering_festival_cancelled/|work=Somerset County Gazette|publisher=Newsquest Media Group|accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guardian stated: "Festival directors accused the police of taking a politically motivated decision to shut down the festival..." and quoted the police as saying "The organisers voluntarily surrendered their licence... therefore it was their decision to cancel, not ours." The Guardian article further stated "The Big Green Gathering ... has been running in its present form since 1994 without complaints about public safety or crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Green Gathering festival cancelled after 'political pressure'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/27/big-green-gathering-climate-camp|website=The Guardian|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisers were able to arrange ticket swaps but not refunds for all ticket holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Rupert|title=Big Green Gathering's ticket refund policy hits dud note|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/nov/07/big-green-gathering-ticket-refund-policy?INTCMP=SRCH|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 January 2011|location=London|date=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event re-launched as 'The Green Gathering' in 2011 at [[Piercefield Park]], near Chepstow in the [[Wye Valley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latest News|url=http://greengathering2011.com/latest-news/|website=The 2011 Green Gathering|accessdate=15 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328060315/http://greengathering2011.com/latest-news/|archivedate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it has run annually since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PAST &amp; FUTURE|url=http://www.greengathering.org.uk/festival/history/|website=The Green Gathering|accessdate=15 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128215306/http://www.greengathering.org.uk/festival/history/|archivedate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the UK Festival Awards 2017, The Green Gathering was presented with the top UK accolade for green events – The Greener Festival Award, for outstanding commitment to reducing its environmental impact and creating positive social impact. http://www.agreenerfestival.com/2017/12/green-gathering-wins-the-uk-greener-festival-award-2017/

==Events==

The Green Gathering is described by its organisers as being "A festival beyond hedonism - a place to party, then wake up the next morning and put the world to rights with your new mates from the night before."

In 2015, an [[eFestivals]] Review described The Green Gathering as "An inspiring modern festival with a refreshing old school edge".

Many environmental and social justice groups such as [[Greenpeace]], Green and Black Cross (GBC was founded in November 2010 to provide legal support for protests against the government’s wave of massive spending cuts.), Refugee Community Kitchen and Reclaim The Power (Reclaim the Power is a UK based direct action network fighting for social, environmental and economic justice.) have a presence at the festival. The Gathering has pioneered renewable energy with every Gathering being powered by wind, sun and people.

Between 2011 and 2015, Green MEP and economist [[Molly Scott Cato]], [[Jenny Jones, Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb|Baronness Jenny Jones]], Green Party leader [[Natalie Bennett]] and Green MP [[Caroline Lucas]] shared the bill in the festival's Speakers' Forum with radical activist Ewa Jasiewicz, Guardian journalist [[Rob Evans (basketball)|Rob Evans]], [[Radical Routes]] co-operators, anti-GM campaigner [[Hector Christie]] and [[Simon Fairlie]], editor of The Land magazine - amongst many others.

On the festival site there are several distinct areas including:

*Permaculture Zone
*Crafts Area
*Campaigns Field
*Low Impact Village
*Healing Field
*Faerie Glade
*Assisted Camping
*An extensive Kids Area

Although The Green Gathering is not primarily a music festival, live music is performed across several small stages and venues. Past performers have included [[3 Daft Monkeys]], [[Banco de Gaia]], [[Nik Turner]], [[Martha Tilston]], [[Radical Dance Faction]], [[Seize the Day (band)|Seize The Day]] and [[Transglobal Underground]].

'''Father Hubert F. Schiffer, S.J.''' (1915 in [[Gütersloh]] – March 27, 1982 in [[Frankfurt]], [[West Germany]])&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12370089/miamian_who_dropped_bomb/ |title=Miamian who dropped bomb |first=Donald P. |last=Myers |newspaper=[[The Miami News]] |date=August 6, 1982 |accessdate=July 14, 2017 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref|DOD|note}} was a [[Germans|German]] [[Jesuit]] who survived the [[nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] "[[Little Boy]]" dropped on [[Hiroshima]].

==Hiroshima bombing==
Schiffer was one of several Jesuit priests who were at their [[Mission (station)|mission]] compound, less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} from [[ground zero]] when the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|explosion occurred]].

;Jesuits and their location
Many retellings of the event state there were eight Jesuit priests (or [[Missionary|missionaries]]), who were eight blocks from ground zero.&lt;ref name=RosaryAd&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12387493/rosary_miracle_at_hiroshima/ |title=Rosary Miracle at Hiroshima (advertisement) |newspaper=[[The News Journal]] |location=[[Wilmington, Delaware]] |date=March 19, 2011 |accessdate=July 15, 2017 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=holysouls&gt;{{cite web |url=http://holysouls.com/sar/rosarymiracle.htm |title=Rosary Miracle - Safe in the Midst of Hiroshima Nuclear Blast !! |date=February 2000 |first=Stephen |last=Rinehart}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hersey]], in his contemporary 1946 account ''[[Hiroshima (book)|Hiroshima]]'', lists four Jesuit priests (Father Superior LaSalle [sic], Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, Father Cieslik, and Father Schiffer) and places them {{convert|1400|yd|m}} "from the center."&lt;ref name=Hersey/&gt; Schiffer himself states there were four Jesuit priests — "Father [[Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle|Hugo Lassalle]], Superior of the whole Jesuit Mission in Japan, and Fathers Kleinsorge, Cieslik, and Schiffer" — and describes his own location as "within the most deadly one-mile radius."&lt;ref name=Rosary/&gt; Schiffer also notes the name of their church — "the Jesuit Church of Our Lady's Assumption."&lt;ref name=Rosary/&gt;

;Explosion
According to the 1946 account of Jesuit priest Father John Siemes, who had been on the outskirts of the city:
{{quote|They were in their rooms at the Parish House—it was a quarter after eight, exactly the time when we had heard the explosion in Nagatsuke—when came the intense light and immediately thereafter the sound of breaking windows, walls and furniture. They were showered with glass splinters and fragments of wreckage. Father Schiffer was buried beneath a portion of a wall and suffered a severe head injury. The Father Superior received most of the splinters in his back and lower extremity from which he bled copiously. Everything was thrown about in the rooms themselves, but the wooden framework of the house remained intact.&lt;ref name=Siemes&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SAwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;pg=PA1 |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |title=Hiroshima—August 6, 1945 |first=John |last=Siemes |date=May 15, 1946 |volume=1 |number=11 |pp=2–6 |via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schiffer's own account describes the explosion:
{{quote|Suddenly, a terrific explosion filled the air with one bursting thunderstroke. An invisible force lifted me from the chair, hurled me through the air, shook me, battered me, whirled me 'round and 'round like a leaf in a gust of autumn wind.&lt;ref name=Rosary&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/library_specialcollections/2/ |title=The Rosary Of Hiroshima |first=Hubert F. |last=Schiffer |date=1953 |website=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

;Survivors
All four Jesuit priests survived the explosion.&lt;ref name=Rosary/&gt; Quoted in 1950, Schiffer said, "Of 14 clergy and [[Laity|laymen]] we lost only one, a Japanese."&lt;ref name=PI1950&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12387872/hiroshima_victim_here_describes_atom/ |title=Hiroshima Victim Here, Describes Atom Horrors |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=March 8, 1950 |accessdate=July 15, 2017 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuits were in a building stronger than most surrounding buildings, as noted by Hersey and Siemes, respectively:
{{quote|sign=|source=|[Father Kleinsorge saw] that all the buildings round about had fallen down except the Jesuits’ mission house, which had long before been braced and double-braced by a priest named Gropper, who was terrified of earthquakes&lt;ref name=Hersey&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1946/08/31/hiroshima |title=Hiroshima |first=John |last=Hersey |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=August 31, 1946 |author-link=John Hersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|sign=|source=|The solidity of the structure which was the work of Brother Gropper again shone forth.&lt;ref name=Siemes/&gt;}}
They were not the only survivors close to ground zero; an estimated 14% of people within {{convert|1|km|mi}} of ground zero survived the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hiroshima-remembered.com/maps/HiroshimaMap.html |title=Atomic Bomb Damage of Hiroshima |website=Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki Remembered}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other survivors included ten people in a streetcar {{convert|750|m|yd}} from ground zero, and a woman in a bank {{convert|260|m|yd}} away from the blast.&lt;ref name="hibakusha"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/twocities/hiroshima/page14.shtml |title=The Story of Hiroshima, Hibakusha Stories |website=atomicarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; One person survived at a distance of just {{convert|170|m|yd}}, protected in the basement of a building while looking for documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/virtual/VirtualMuseum_e/exhibit_e/exh0203_e/exh02033_e.html |title=Hiroshima Testimony: Special Exhibit 3 |website=Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum Special Exhibition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Religious aspects
The survival of the priests has sometimes been referred to as a [[miracle]].&lt;ref name=RosaryAd/&gt;&lt;ref name=holysouls/&gt; In 1951, Schiffer said:
{{quote|sign=|source=|I won't call it a miracle exactly, but I think we were under the special protection of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=http://cdm16313.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/LMNP01/id/22051 |title=A-Bombed Priest Final Forum Speaker Tuesday |newspaper=The Loyola Maroon |location=[[New Orleans]] |pp=1, 6 |date=May 11, 1951 |accessdate=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Similarities with [[Nagasaki]] are sometimes highlighted, where a [[Franciscan]] [[friary]] established by St. [[Maximilian Kolbe]] was "unaffected by the bomb which fell there",&lt;ref name=CH/&gt; as "the friary was protected from the force of the bomb by an intervening mountain".&lt;ref name=CH&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2015/08/09/the-priests-who-survived-the-atomic-bomb/ |title=The priests who survived the atomic bomb |magazine=[[The Catholic Herald]] |first=Donal Anthony |last=Foley |date=August 9, 2015 |accessdate=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Schiffer met both the pilot and co-pilot of the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] that bombed Hiroshima, the ''[[Enola Gay]]''. In [[New York City]] in 1951, Schiffer met co-pilot [[Robert A.

The '''Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival''' ('''HVSF''') is a non-profit professional theater company based at [[Boscobel (mansion)|Boscobel]] in [[Garrison, New York]]. The festival runs a roughly twelve-week repertory season each year, operating under a large open-air theater tent. Its productions attract a total audience of about 50,000 from the Hudson Valley, New York City, and 40 US states.

HVSF also performs [[William Shakespeare]]'s works and live theater throughout the tri-state area by touring. The company has limited runs of its most popular programs through its "HVSF On The Road" series and brings student-oriented productions and education programs to about 50,000 elementary, middle, and high school students and teachers each year. HVSF’s arts education programs also include training for early-career theater artists by way of its Conservatory Company, professional development for educators, and free audience engagement offerings before and after performances throughout the summer.

==History==
HVSF was founded by Melissa Stern and Terry O’Brien in September 1987 with an outdoor production of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]'' at [[Manitoga]], home of industrial designer [[Russel Wright]], in Garrison, New York. The following year, Boscobel House and Gardens agreed to host HVSF’s mainstage season on the estate’s expansive grounds, and that summer’s production of Shakespeare’s ''[[As You Like It]]'' was performed under a tent overlooking the Hudson River.

In 1994, the festival added a second show to its season and began hands-on, performance-driven education programs within area schools. In 2004, HVSF began to tour productions to middle and high schools. In 2006, HVSF acquired a custom-designed, open-air theater tent with seating for 540.

The Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival was the subject of a one-hour documentary and two hour film of a performance of ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' which premiered on the [[PBS]] affiliate [[WNET]] (Channel 13 in New York City) on September 18, 2008. The program also aired on WLIW (Channel 21 on Long Island).&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.thirteen.org/episode/show/1672]''[[PBS]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/120398.html]''[[Playbill]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 500,000 patrons have been served since HVSF's first season in 1987. Terry O’Brien led the theater for 27 years, directing more than 30 productions, and stepped down as Artistic Director in December 2013. After a search for his successor, HVSF’s Board of Directors appointed Davis McCallum as Artistic Director in May 2014.

In 2016, the festival produced a community-driven production of Thornton Wilder's ''[[Our Town]]'' with a cast of about 40 citizen actors from the Hudson Valley region, directed by John Christian Plummer.

In 2017, the festival mounted its first new plays: ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' by Kate Hamill (adapted from the novel by [[Jane Austen]]), and [[Lauren Gunderson]]'s ''The Book of Will''.

==Location==
With its plays performed in an open-air theater tent on the grounds of the Boscobel, the festival is known for its backdrop.&lt;ref name="obrien"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/07/movies/nature-s-a-stage-and-often-a-player.html?smid=pl-share|title=Nature's a Stage and Often a Player|last=Marks|first=Peter|date=7 July 2000|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newsday&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hudson Valley Shakespeare fest returns to Boscobel|last=Serico|first=Chris|date=11 June 2012|publisher=Newsday|url=http://newyork.newsday.com/entertainment/things-to-do/hudson-valley-shakespeare-fest-returns-to-boscobel-1.3770457}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stage, a rough patch of dirt that is on the same level as the first few rows of the audience, recedes into lawns with a view&lt;ref name=obrien/&gt; of the [[Hudson River]] and [[West Point, New York|West Point]] in the distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=THE UNCERTAIN ART: Is There a Doctor in the House?|last=Nuland|first=Sherwin B.|journal=The American Scholar|volume=69|issue=4|date=Autumn 2000|jstor=41213080}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company uses the vast open space behind the stage as scenery for the plays.&lt;ref name=newsday/&gt; According to [[Ben Brantley]] of ''The New York Times'', "nature and Shakespeare are the stars" in this festival.&lt;ref name=tempest&gt;{{Cite news|title=Prospero May Manipulate Nature, but Here, Nature Sets the Stage|last=Brantley|first=Ben|publisher=The New York Times|date=3 August 2005|url=http://theater2.nytimes.com/2005/08/03/theater/reviews/03temp.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
The festival was named among The New York Times' "50 Essential Summer Festivals" in 2016, was [[Hudson Valley (magazine)|Hudson Valley Magazine]]'s 2016 Editors’ Pick for Best Summer Theater, and was nominated for a Drama League Award for its 2015 production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''.

It produces classic and new works with an economy of style, focusing on script, actors and audience with the Hudson River and [[Hudson Highlands]] as its set and setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Much Ado about Nothing by William Shakespeare|last=Gulley|first=Ervene|journal=Theatre Journal|volume=42|issue=2|date=May 1991|jstor=3208227}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Wall Street Journal]] hails it as, "The most purely enjoyable summer Shakespeare festival in America," while The New York Times comments, "If anyone wonders about the future of live theater or asks where the audience is, the answer is 'Under that tent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater2.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/06theatwe.html]''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

It is listed as a "Major Festival" in the book ''Shakespeare Festivals Around the World'' by Marcus D. Gregio (Editor), 2004.

==Education programs==
In addition to its summer productions, the festival sponsors year-round education programs to about 50,000 students and teachers annually. These programs include in-school residencies and theater arts workshops for students, resource workshops for educators, a fall touring production for students in grades K-5, a spring touring production for students in grades 6-12, its annual Shakespeare Summer Camp for ages 8–16, and the Teachers' Shakespeare Institute. HVSF's Conservatory Company, a performance based training program for 6 - 8 early career actors, offers on- and off-stage opportunities to work alongside the festival's acting company.

'''''India's Daughter''''' is a [[documentary film]] directed by [[Leslee Udwin]] and is part of the [[BBC]]'s ongoing [[Storyville (TV series)|Storyville]] series.&lt;ref name=SoulFilmMaker&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Delhi gang rapist left 'stain on my soul', says British film maker|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/11446337/Interview-with-Delhi-gang-rapist-left-stain-on-my-soul-says-British-film-maker.html|accessdate=6 March 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is based on the [[2012 Delhi gang rape]] and murder of 23-year-old Jyoti Singh who was a [[physiotherapy]] student.&lt;ref name=YoutubeBlock /&gt;&lt;ref name=IndiaBansTV&gt;{{cite news|title=India bans TV stations from showing interview with man who raped student|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/03/india-outraged-interview-man-convicted-gang-rape-student|accessdate=6 March 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was scheduled to be aired on TV channels round the world on March 8, 2015 to coincide with  [[International Women's Day]]. However, when excerpts of the film, which included an interview with Mukesh Singh, one of the four men convicted of the rape and murder, were broadcast, a court stay order prohibiting the broadcast was obtained by the Indian police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dec 16 documentary: Media trials tend to influence judges, says HC|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dec-16-documentary-media-trials-tend-to-influence-judges-says-hc/article1-1325487.aspx|accessdate=27 March 2015|quote=Delhi Police approached a lower court last week to prevent the broadcast on International Women’s Day.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BBC complied with the request and did not air the film in India. Yet it aired outside of India on 4 March, was uploaded on [[YouTube]], and soon went [[viral video|viral]] via shares on social media. On 5 March, the Indian government directed YouTube to block the video in India.&lt;ref name=YoutubeBlock&gt;{{cite news|title=India asks YouTube to block banned rape film|url=https://news.yahoo.com/delhi-rape-victims-father-urges-viewing-documentary-080939613.html|accessdate=6 March 2015|work=[[Yahoo News]]|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YoutubeBlocks&gt;{{cite news|title=YouTube blocks BBC's Nirbhaya documentary video|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/videos/532286/youtube-blocks-access-to-bbc-documentary-nirbhaya-in-india.html|accessdate=6 March 2015|work=[[India Today]]|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Delhi protests-Another lamp-post revolutionary.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Students protesting at [[Raisina Hill]], [[Rajpath]], December 2012]]
The documentary is based on the [[2012 Delhi gang rape|Delhi gang rape]], an incident that occurred on 16 December 2012 in [[South Delhi]].&lt;ref name=Chaotic&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2258306/Delhi-gang-rape-Five-men-charged-Jyoti-Singh-Pandey-murder-appear-court.html | title=Judge bars Delhi gang rape defendants from chaotic courtroom after 150 people cram into space meant for 30 | work=[[Daily Mail]] | date=7 January 2013 | accessdate=5 March 2015 | last=Hills | first=Suzannah}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The victim, Jyoti Singh, watched the film ''[[Life of Pi (film)|Life of Pi]]'' with a male friend, Awindra Pratap Pandey,&lt;ref name=tragedy&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/exploring-the-lives-of-the-rape-victim-and-suspects-in-india-a-879187.html|title= Rape Tragedy in India: Dreams of 'the Fearless One'|work=Der Spiegel|date=25 January 2013 |first1=Matthias | last1=Schulz | first2=Wieland | last2=Wagner}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which they boarded a privately run bus to return home.&lt;ref name=Rahman&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/03/india-outraged-interview-man-convicted-gang-rape-student|title=India bans TV stations from showing interview with man who raped student |work=The Guardian|date=2015-03-04|first=Maseeh | last=Rahman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was [[assault]]ed and [[gang rape]]d on the bus; her friend was also physically assaulted during the incident. Both of them were subsequently thrown from the bus. She received [[Emergency medicine|emergency treatment]] including several [[surgery|surgeries]] in India and [[Singapore]] but died on 29 December 2012 due to the serious nature of the [[injury|injuries]] she sustained in the assault.&lt;ref name=VicDies&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-20860569 | title=Delhi gang-rape victim dies in hospital in Singapore | work=[[BBC News]] | date=29 December 2012 | accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident received widespread media coverage. It was condemned and triggered widespread public protest and criticism of the [[Government of India|Indian government]] for not providing enough protection to women. International media covered the incident only after persistent public protests.&lt;ref name=magnifies&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/world/asia/weak-response-of-india-government-in-rape-case-stokes-rage.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | title=Leaders’ Response Magnifies Outrage in India Rape Case | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=29 December 2012 | accessdate=5 March 2015 | last=Yardley | first=Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six men were arrested, including a 17-year-old juvenile, and accused as perpetrators of the assaults.

Udwin has said it was the protests in response to the rape that drew her to make this film.  "I was absolutely awestruck by the ordinary men and women of India who poured out onto the streets in response to this horrific gang rape and who demanded change for women's rights.

== Interview ==
One of the convicted rapists serving life imprisonment, Mukesh Singh, was interviewed for the documentary. He said in the interview "When being raped, she shouldn’t fight back. She should just be silent and allow the rape. Then they’d have dropped her off after ‘doing her’, and only hit the boy."&lt;ref name=EarlyBBC&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/05/delhi-gang-rape-documentary-airs-early-on-bbc-following-objections | title=Delhi gang-rape documentary airs early on BBC following objections | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=5 March 2015| accessdate=5 March 2015 | last=Rawlinson | first=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He later added, "A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy … A decent girl won’t roam around at nine o’clock at night … Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing indecent things, wearing indecent clothes."&lt;ref name=Rahman /&gt;  A report by the [[Navbharat Times]] has suggested that Mukesh Singh was paid {{currency|40,000|INR}} (about {{currency|420|GBP}}) to do the interview. According to the report, initially he had asked for {{currency|200,000|INR}}, but the amount was negotiated down and the sum was given to his family.&lt;ref name=paid&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-india-s-daughter-rape-convict-paid-rs40000-for-interview-2066496 |title=India's Daughter: Rape convict paid Rs.40,000 for interview? |author= |date=6 March 2015 |work=[[DNA India]] | |accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the filmmakers deny that he was paid for the interview.&lt;ref name="isnot"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/indias-daughters-the-ban-that-actually-isnt/article6975342.ece | title=The ban that actually isn’t | work=[[The Hindu]] | date=10 March 2015 | accessdate=10 March 2015 | author=Hegde, Sanjay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A. P. Singh, a defence lawyer in the case, was shown saying, “If my daughter or sister engaged in pre-marital activities and disgraced herself and allowed herself to lose face and character by doing such things, I would most certainly take this sort of sister or daughter to my farmhouse, and in front of my entire family, I would put petrol on her and set her alight.”  Asked later if he stood by those comments, he insisted that he did.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/indias-daughter-how-india-tried-to-suppress-the-bbc-delhi-gangrape-documentary-10088890.html | title=India's Daughter: How India tried to suppress the BBC Delhi gang-rape documentary | work=[[The Independent]] | date=5 March 2015 | accessdate=5 March 2015 | last=Withnall | first=Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She  says that the film is part of a wider [[White savior narrative in film|"white saviour"]] mentality.  She also said the film failed to profile Indian men who are "on the side of law and order and morality"&lt;ref name="nprKrishnan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyo.in/politics/kavita-krishnan-nirbhaya-december-16-indias-daughter-leslee-udwin-mukesh-singh-bbc/story/1/2347.html |title=Nirbhaya film: Solidarity is what we want, not a civilising mission |author=Kavita Krishnan |date=3 March 2015 |website= |work=DailyO |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.N.

[[Meenakshi Lekhi]], a [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] spokesperson, alleged that in screening the documentary on [[BBC 4]], a channel dedicated to international arts, music and cultural content, that the makers didn't stick to the stated objective of a "social purpose" and were instead trying to benefit commercially by creating controversies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Rape-is-a-global-issue-then-why-is-only-India-in-the-spotlight-BJPs-Meenakshi-Lekhi/articleshow/46513189.cms | title=Rape is a global issue, then why is only India in the spotlight | work=[[The Times of India]] | date=10 March 2015 | accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Indianola Texas.jpg|thumb|400px|Indianola by Helmuth Holtz, Sept. 1860]]

'''Indianola''' is a [[ghost town]] located on [[Matagorda Bay]] in [[Calhoun County, Texas|Calhoun County]], [[Texas]], [[United States]].  The community, once the [[county seat]] of Calhoun County, is a part of the [[Victoria, Texas]], [[Victoria metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].  In 1875, the city had a population of 5,000, but on September 15 of that year, a powerful [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] struck, killing between 150 and 300 and almost entirely destroying the town. Indianola was rebuilt, only to be wiped out on August 19, 1886, by [[Indianola Hurricane of 1886|another intense hurricane]], which was followed by a fire. Indianola was designated a [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark]] in 1963, marker number 2642.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indianola, Texas|url=http://www.9key.com/markers/marker_detail.asp?atlas_number=5057002642|work=Recorded Texas Historic Landmark|publisher=William Nienke, Sam Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===German immigration port of entry===
[[Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels]], representing the [[Adelsverein]], selected Indian Point in December, 1844 as port of entry for the Verein colonists from [[Germany]].   Prince Solms renamed the port Carlshafen in honor of himself, Count Carl of Castell-Castell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brister|first=Louis E|title=Count Carl of Castell-Castell |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fcaap|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Count Victor August of Leiningen-Westerburg-Alt-Leiningen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brister|first=Louis E|title=Count Victor August of Leiningen-Westerburg-Alt-Leiningen |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fle60|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom Solms claimed had been christened Carl. Prince Solms' choice of Carlshafen and its inadequate accommodations as a port of entry, as well as the isolated route to New Braunfels, was to keep the Germans from interacting with any Americans.&lt;ref&gt;King (1967) pp.52-58&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1845 [[Henry Francis Fisher]] conspired with [[Friedrich Armand Strubberg|Dr. F. Schubbert]] to coerce incoming immigrants to sign legal documents disassociating themselves from the Verein and to join Schubbert's colony in [[Milam County, Texas|Milam County]].&lt;ref&gt;Solms (2000) p.131&lt;/ref&gt;{{details|Friedrich Armand Strubberg}}

In May 1846, Meusebach received a letter from Count Castell informing him 4,304 colonists were on their way to Texas. With no funds and no new settlements, the mass of emigrants were stalled at Carlshafen. Meusebach's requests to the Verein for more money, and his warnings at pending bankruptcy for the Verein, brought no results. As a last resort, Meusebach instructed D.H. Klaener to publish the plight in the German news media. Embarrassed by the publicity, the Verein established an inadequate $60,000 letter of credit.&lt;ref&gt;King (1967) pp.75-83&lt;/ref&gt; Meusebach had arranged with the Torrey Brothers for transporting the emigrants inland, but the [[United States]] hired the Torrey Brothers for use in the [[Mexican–American War]].&lt;ref&gt;King (1967) pp.85,87&lt;/ref&gt; An epidemic of [[spinal meningitis]] broke out at Carlshafen and spread with the emigrants to [[New Braunfels, Texas|New Braunfels]] and [[Fredericksburg, Texas|Fredericksburg]].&lt;ref&gt;King (1967) p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel Addition White and William M. Cook founded Indian Point, later Indianola, in August, 1846.&lt;ref name="Indianola, Texas"&gt;{{cite web|last=Malsch|first=Brownson|title=Indianola, Texas|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hvi11|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these immigrants purchased land from Samuel White and established a settlement at Indian Point. The name of the settlement changed to Indianola in 1849 by combining the word ''Indian'' with ''ola'', the Spanish word for "wave". The German immigrants continued to refer to the community as ''Carlshaven'' (Carl's Harbor) in honor of Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels.&lt;ref name=wolff&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolff|first=Linda|title=Indianola and Matagorda Island 1837–1887|year=1999|publisher=Eakin Press|location=Austin, Texas|isbn=1-57168-340-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
[[Image:Indianola.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Indianola, Texas in 1875]]
From its founding in 1846, Indianola served as a major port, and before the 1875 storm was second only to [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] as Texas's primary port.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/mobot31753000247996|title=Personal narrative of explorations and incidents in Texas, New Mexico, California, Sonora, and Chihuahua, connected with the United States and Mexican boundary commission, during the years 1850, '51, '52, and '53 /By John Russell Bartlett, United States commissioner during that period ...|last=Bartlett|first=John Russell|date=1854|publisher=New York and London : D. Appleton &amp; company,|others=Missouri Botanical Garden}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town incorporated in 1853. In 1856, the port received cargoes of [[camel]]s, part of the [[US Army Camel Corps]] experiment to replace horses and mules as the primary pack animal in the southwestern parts of the country.

During the [[American Civil War]], Indianola was twice occupied by [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops, in October 1862 and November 1863. During the second occupation, part of a Union infantry regiment moving from Indianola to [[Matagorda Island]] [[69th Indiana Infantry drownings|drowned in Matagorda Bay]].

In 1869, the world's first mechanically-refrigerated shipment of beef left Indianola for [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].

During [[World War II]], the [[U.S. Army]] constructed an anti-aircraft firing range along the Indianola shoreline to train gunners and the facility was used primarily by military personnel from [[Camp Hulen]], located outside of [[Palacios, Texas|Palacios]].

===Impact of storms===
Having survived severe storms before, Indianola was almost totally destroyed [[1875_Atlantic_hurricane_season#Hurricane_Three|on 16 September 1875]]. ''The New York Times'' reported in detail on the extensive loss of life and property. Even the lighthouses were swept away&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|title=The Gulf Cyclone: Additional Particulars Of The Destruction Of Indianola. Hardly A House Left Unharmed|date=September 30, 1875|accessdate=November 9, 2013|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30D15FF385F1A7493C2AA1782D85F418784F9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lighthouse keeper|keepers]], including Thomas H. Mayne and Edward Flick Jr. of the East Shoal Lighthouse, killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67362597|title=Thomas Louis Mayne|accessdate=November 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town was rebuilt but events were repeated in 1886. The destruction served as an abject lesson for many residents of [[Galveston]], 100 miles up the Texas coast. However, their calls for a [[seawall]] to protect that city went unheeded, and Galveston nearly shared Indianola's fate when the [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]] struck the island.

A railroad was intended to connect the port of Indianola to [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]].  After the two storms, discouraged investors abandoned the venture and made Galveston the port of choice. After Galveston's hurricane, shipping traffic recentered over time to inland [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].

After the 1886 storm, the county seat was moved to [[Port Lavaca, Texas|Port Lavaca]]. On October 4, 1887, the post office in Indianola was permanently closed and the town declared "dead".&lt;ref name=wolff /&gt; Today, almost nothing remains of the original Indianola, as, due to storm [[erosion]], most of the site of the city is now under water. A [[granite]] marker was placed on the shore at the nearest point to the Indianola courthouse, now 300 feet (about 90 meters) away in Matagorda Bay. It reads, "Calhoun County Courthouse. Edward Beaumont, Architect 1859. During the Storms of 1875 and 1886, precious lives were saved within its walls of shell, concrete, and lime. Abandoned 1886."  The site is also home to a statue of [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]].

Indianola is now the site of a small [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] fishing village.

==Popular culture==

===In literature===
In [[Elizabeth Hand]]'s novel ''Aestival Tide'', a reconstructed Indianola is featured as the lowermost level of the central ziggurat in the dome city of Araboth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hand, Elizabeth|title=Aestival Tide|edition=Spectra Special Editions|publisher=Spectra|date=August 1, 1992|isbn=978-0-553-29542-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel ''Matagorda'' by author [[Louis L'Amour]], much of the action took place in Indianola, Texas on the day it was destroyed by the 1875 hurricane.  The courthouse, the site of which is now underwater out in the bay, was featured as the last refuge of the townspeople.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Matagorda: A Novel|author=L'Amour, Louis|publisher=Bantam|date=February 1, 1985|isbn=978-0-553-28108-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Part I of ''[[Isaac's Storm]]'', in the chapter "Galveston: An Absurd Delusion" (pages 79–84), [[Erik Larson (author)|Erik Larson]] describes the two storms that ravaged Indianola and the significance of these storms for [[Galveston, Texas]], leading up to the [[Galveston storm of 1900]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Erik Larson (author)|Larson, Erik]]|year=1999|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/isaacsstorm/book/index.html|title=Isaac's Storm|publisher=[[Random House]] Publishing|isbn= 0-609-60233-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He notes: "At first, Galveston's leading men seemed to grasp the significance of the Indianola storms. Anyone who looked at a map could see that Galveston was even more vulnerable to destruction than Indianola.  It had no picket of barrier islands to shelter it, no buffer of mainland prairie.  The city faced the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] head-on." He further observes: "Six weeks after the second Indianola storm, a group of thirty prominent Galveston residents calling themselves the Progressive Association met and resolved to build a seawall", and "The city's ''Evening Tribune'' endorsed the plan". However, although "The state eventually did authorize a bond to pay for the work," the city's engineer E.M. Hartwick observed, "this was some months after the flood, and by then the attitude was, Oh, we'll never get another one--and they didn't build."

Larson criticizes meteorologist [[Isaac Cline]] (among others) for this failure. For example, Larson cites statements Cline published in the July 1891 Galveston ''News'' article, "West India Hurricanes":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cline, Isaac M.|title=West India Hurricanes|work=Galveston 'News'|date=July 16, 1891}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''If Galveston had any lingering anxiety about its failure to erect a seawall Isaac's 1891 article would have eased them.  It was here that he belittled hurricane fears as the artifacts of 'an absurd delusion.'  He was especially confident about storm surges.  Galveston would escape harm, he argued, because the incoming water would spread first over the vast lowlands ''behind'' Galveston, on the Texas mainland north of the bay where the land was even closer to sea level.

:'' 'It would be impossible,' he wrote, 'for any cyclone to create a storm wave which could materially injure the city.' ''

Further, in Part III of ''Isaac's Storm'', in a chapter titled "Ritter's Cafe: ''You Can't Frighten Me''", Larson publishes the recollections of Mollie Cohen, whose impressions of the Galveston Storm of 1900 reminded her of the second Indianola hurricane: 
:'' 'We had a storm like this in '86,' Mollie said, referring to the winds and rain that had reached Galveston from the last of the big Indianola hurricanes. 'My father's store on Market Street was flooded,' she said, casually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Erik Larson (author)|Larson, Erik]]|year=1999|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/isaacsstorm/book/index.html|title=Isaac's Storm|publisher=[[Random House]] Publishing|page=157|isbn= 0-609-60233-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In music===
{{refimprove|date=June 2012}}
Singer/songwriter, [[Charlie Robison]], included a song titled "Indianola" on the 1998 album ''Life of the Party'' that is a specific reference to Indianola, Texas. The song begins from the perspective of a German immigrant approaching Indianola by sea and chronicling details of the narrator's family. The narrator and his cousin attempt to traverse the South to join the [[Union Army]] in the [[American Civil War]], though they encounter Rebel resistance in Indianola, TX.  The next scene of the folk song briefly addresses the [[stock market crash of 1929]] in an indirect fashion, noting that little change occurred in their respective lives other than rust's accumulating on wagon wheels. While this verse is brief in regards to words and time, it denotes a subtle and increasing disaffection in the American/Texan experience, adversely affected by seemingly non-relevant incidences. The storyline then progresses to World War II, introducing an internal struggle between the call of duty of the United States of America and its armed conflict with Germany, the ancestral point of origin of many Americans. The overall sentiment of the song begins as a story of new promises followed by a series of fictional, though personally carved facts, that illustrate a common experience for the individualist. Texas exemplifies a spirit that is not only uniquely a Texan story, but an American one, thrusting the individual against the external influence that would assume its right to assert its own values. This, however, should not be confused with contemporary movements deviating from the spirit of this song.

Singer/songwriter [http://www.brianburnsmusic.com/about.php Brian Burns] included the song "Indianola" on his 2004 album "[http://www.brianburnsmusic.com/music.php Heavy Weather]".    The [http://www.brianburnsmusic.com/song.php?songinfo=040515 lyrics] of the song chronicle the full life cycle of Indianola with verses from the points of view of a personified Matagorda bay,  an immigrant who helped build the city (Johann), a worker who came to help "bury the lost souls who perished that day" (Isaac), and finally the songwriter himself visiting the site (Brian).   It is unclear whether the "Johann" mentioned in verse three refers to the Johann Dethardt, the first ship to bring settlers into the area,  or Johann Swartz, the owner/builder of the first home erected in what would become Indianola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~txcalhou/indianolatownmarkers.html|title=Town of Indianola Markers|website=www.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Injury''', also known as '''physical trauma''', is damage to the body caused by external force.&lt;ref name=NIH2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/woundsandinjuries.html |title=Wounds and Injuries: MedlinePlus |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be caused by accidents, falls, hits, weapons, and other causes.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; [[Major trauma]] is injury that has the potential to cause prolonged [[disability]] or [[death]].

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) developed the [[International Classification of External Causes of Injury]] (ICECI). Under this system, injuries are classified by:
* mechanism of injury;
* objects/substances producing injury;
* place of occurrence;
* activity when injured;
* the role of human intent;
and additional modules. These codes allow the identification of distributions of injuries in specific populations and case identification for more detailed research on causes and preventive efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/adaptations/iceci/en/ |title=International Classification of External Causes of Injury (ICECI) |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, LS (2015) Injury Epidemiology: Fourth Edition. Free online at www.nanlee.net&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] developed the Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System (OIICS). Under this system injuries are classified by
* nature,
* part of body affected,
* source and secondary source, and
* event or exposure.
The OIICS was first published in 1992 and has been updated several times since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwn.cdc.gov/wisards/oiics/ |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |title=Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Chisholm''', 16th-century Scottish soldier and chief officer, Comptroller and ''Prefect'' of the Scottish artillery for [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and [[James VI of Scotland]], and keeper of the '''King's Wark''' in Leith. Chisholm was a supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots after her exile in England.

==Career==

===Mary's fireworks===
[[Mary, Queen of Scots]] was eager for Chisholm's arrival as a messenger in Perth in April 1564.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Pollen ed., ''Papal Negotiations with Mary Queen of Scots'' (SHS, Edinburgh, 1901), p. 450.&lt;/ref&gt; As Comptroller of the Royal Artillery for Mary, he received in 1565 the large sum of 10,000 Scottish marks on behalf of the Queen, from the Burgh council of [[Edinburgh]], for the right of superiority of Edinburgh over [[Leith]]. The money was used to take the royal artillery to the west of Scotland during the rebellion called the [[Chaseabout Raid]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Marwick ed., ''Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh, 1557–1571'' (Edinburgh, 1875), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Chisholm arranged the [[fireworks|firework display]] for the baptism of her son Prince James at [[Stirling Castle]] in December 1566. The preparations were expensive, and John had to send to the Queen twice for extra money. John's account for the event lists his ingredients, including, [[colophony]], [[orpiment]], [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]], arrows and dozens of small pottery vessels. The fireworks were made in Leith and shipped to [[Stirling]] in great secrecy, being carried to the castle at the dead of night "for feir of knowledge thairof." John also arranged the making of costumes used in a pageant of an assault on a mock castle.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland'' vol.12 (1970), pp. 58 and 403–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1567 [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] confirmed in [[Parliament of Scotland|Parliament]] John Chisholm's possession of the King's Wark in Leith,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1567/4/15 ''The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707'', K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2013) Retrieved: 3 March 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; which he had held in ''feu'' since May 1564.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w4MvAAAAYAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Robertson, David, ''The Sculptured Stones of Leith'', (1851)], p.67 citing charter in City archives.&lt;/ref&gt; There, John was in charge of the long established Shore-side arsenal which served the [[Royal Scots Navy]]. The arsenal had been founded by [[James I of Scotland]] in 1434. The buildings, which included a tower had been burnt in May 1544 during the war of the [[Rough Wooing]] after 80,000 cannonballs were [[Burning of Edinburgh (1544)|looted by the English army]].&lt;ref&gt;Patten, William, in ''Tudor Tracts'', (1903), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1545 [[Robert Logan of Restalrig]] used the tower as a [[Tolbooth]] for Leith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/51945/details/edinburgh+leith+the+shore+king+s+wark/ RCAHMS Canmore database: King's Wark]&lt;/ref&gt; Now demolished, the tower was depicted in a drawing by [[John Slezer]] in 1693.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalcollections.org.uk/index.php?a=ViewItem&amp;i=440&amp;WINID=1362442350460 Slezer drawings, Edinburgh City Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; The site is now a bar and restaurant.

[[Anne of Denmark]] arrived in Scotland on 1 May 1590 with James VI, and stayed five nights in the King's Wark.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10, (Edinburgh, 1936), 863.&lt;/ref&gt; The path from the ship to their throne room in Chisholm's house was strewn with [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|tapestry]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, David, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'', (1985), pp. 100 and 139: [https://archive.org/stream/papersrelativeto00crairich#page/n69/mode/2up ''Papers Relative to the Marriage of James VI'', (1828) pp.37-8]: [https://archive.org/stream/memoirsaffairss01denngoog#page/n122/mode/2up Moysie, David, ''Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland'', (1830), p. 83].&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony of the reception at Leith and the King's Wark had been carefully planned the previous September. A special wooden stair was built for her to enter directly into the first-floor hall. There were chairs for Anne and James VI on this "scaffold", where they sat in public and listened to a speech of welcome called an oration or "harangue," made by [[James Elphinstone, 1st Lord Balmerino|James Elphinstone]] in French. The directions included the order of entry, seating, and even where people should look. Once Anne was in the King's Wark, the scaffold was taken away, and the people of Leith were ordered to unload any guns and forbidden to mend ships on the Shore until she left.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Napier Thomson|Thomson, Thomas]], ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=cGALAAAAYAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''David Calderwood's History of Kirk of Scotland'', vol. 5 (1844)], pp. 60–64, 94. (James Elphinstone also had a house on the Shore in Leith, "Balmerino's House".)&lt;/ref&gt;

The buildings passed to Bernard Lindsay of Lochhill in 1606 by Act of Parliament. Bernard Lindsay, a chamber servant of James VI, was required to reserve a cellar for storing wines for the King's use.&lt;ref&gt;''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland'', vol.4 (1816), p.315&lt;/ref&gt; He also added a [[royal tennis|tennis court]]. As a courtier Lindsay had brought [[Henry Wotton]] to James VI at [[Dunfermline Palace]] in 1601, when Wotton was masquerading as an Italian "Octavio Baldi".&lt;ref&gt;''CSP. Scotland'', vol. 13 (HMSO 1969), p. 876: H. Wotton, ''Reliquiae Wottonianae'' (London 1654), 29–35.&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for James's "salmonlike" return to Scotland in 1617, cannon wheels and stocks were kept there, and in 1623 the [[Master of Work to the Crown of Scotland|Master of Work]], [[James Murray (architect)|James Murray of Kilbaberton]] stored cannon and shot from a Dunkirk ship in Bernard Lindsay's Close.&lt;ref&gt;Imrie &amp; Dunbar, ed., ''Accounts of the Master's of Work'', vol. 2, HMSO, Edinburgh (1882), pp. 81, 157 and 159.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that Bernard Street takes its name from Lindsay of Lochhill. In 1647 the site was acquired by Edinburgh burgh council from William Dick of Braid.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Marguerite, ed., ''Extracts Burgh Records Edinburgh, 1604-1624'', (1931), p.376: [https://books.google.com/books?id=caIJAAAAIAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Tales, Traditions, &amp; Antiquities of Leith'' (1865)], pp. 36–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adversity===
John Chisholm was appointed Prefect and "Second Person" of the royal artillery of Scotland (S. D. N. Regis Machinarii Bellitarii Prefecti) on 23 August 1569, during the Regency of the [[Regent Moray|James Stewart, Earl of Moray]].&lt;ref&gt;''Register of the Great Seal of Scotland'', vol. 6 (1963), p. 141, no. 723.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1570, Chisholm joined [[William Kirkcaldy of Grange]] in the garrison of [[Edinburgh Castle]] that remained loyal to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. During the following 'Lang Siege' of the Castle and [[Marian civil war]], Chisholm travelled abroad seeking support and supplies. In February 1571 he was in London and wrote about ongoing peace negotiations, hoping that [[Elizabeth I of England]] would act to restore Mary to the Scottish throne. He hoped that the frustrating talks would be concluded soon; "I hoip seurlie within sax ouilkis (six weeks), we salbe at our wittis end and sooner."

Chisholm visited Mary at [[Sheffield Castle]], and took letters to France in April, borrowing £3 from [[John Lesley]], [[Bishop of Ross (Scotland)|Bishop of Ross]]. The Bishop kept a note of Chisholm's movements; he returned to Scotland from Dieppe in June 1571, carrying money sent by the exiled [[James Beaton (archbishop of Glasgow)|Bishop of Glasgow]], cannonballs of four different calibres and [[pike (weapon)|pikes]]. These supplies were obtained from [[Charles IX of France]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/correspondancedi00feneuoft#page/203/mode/1up ''Correspondance Diplomatique De Bertrand De Salignac De La Mothe Fenelon'', vol. 4, Paris (1840), pp. 203–4.]&lt;/ref&gt; Chisholm and his ship were captured at [[North Queensferry]] in July by [[Patrick Lindsay, 6th Lord Lindsay|Patrick, Lord Lindsay]], but he managed to pass some of the money to Mary's supporters. It was thought he had intended to take [[Tantallon Castle]], linking up with Mary's supporters who unsuccessfully attacked the castle on 2 July 1571.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 3 (1903), pp. 478–80, 485–87, 529, 532–33, 535, 620–21, 623–24 and 636.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chisholm was allowed to return to France and joined the Bishop of Glasgow. In March 1573 [[William Maitland of Lethington]] thought his adversaries had discovered the key to the cipher code he used in his letters when James Kirkcaldy was captured. He used John Chisholm's code in a letter to the Bishop. Agents of the English Secretary of State, [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], intercepted and easily decoded this letter.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 4 (1905), p. 523, no. 586.&lt;/ref&gt; John wrote to Mary, Queen of Scots from Paris in August 1575. He asked that he might come to England and serve in her household with his wife, and concluded his letter with his hopes of Mary's "suddane" delivery from her troubles.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol.5 (1907), pp. 158–60, no. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

After this period of exile,&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 12 (1970), p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; in July 1576 Chisholm gained an official pardon for his support of Mary and Grange and unauthorized travel abroad. On 31 May 1579 he was re-appointed as "Comptroller and Second Person of the Artillery and Munition within all parts of Scotland."&lt;ref&gt;''Register of the Privy Council of Scotland'', vol. 7, HMSO Edinburgh (1966), p. 97, no. 659, and pp. 312–13,  no. 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; The gift of the King's Wark, "Opus Regium," was confirmed in May 1588, giving his title as; ''Compotorus Rotulatori Tormentorum Bellicorum'' – Controller of the accounting rolls for war machines.&lt;ref&gt;''Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, 1580–93'', (1888), pp. 529–30, no. 1547.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Ambassador [[Bertrand de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon]] noted that Chisholm was still active as a supporter of Mary in February 1583, and Chisholm asked that Mary should continue paying him a pension. In May 1583 The English diplomat [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] reported him as a "notorious instrument" for Maineville, the agent of the [[Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox]] who was expelled from Scotland by the [[Raid of Ruthven|Gowrie Regime]].&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 6 (1910), pp. 312, 375, 441 and 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign resulted in a resolution by the [[United States Senate]] and contributed to the decision to send troops by the [[African Union]]. The film also called for an April 20 world wide canvassing campaign, called "Cover the Night". On April 5, 2012, Invisible Children released a follow-up video, titled ''[[#Kony 2012 Part II|Kony 2012: Part II&amp;nbsp;– Beyond Famous]]'', which failed to repeat the success of the original.

==''Kony 2012''==
The film documents the [[Invisible Children, Inc.|Invisible Children]]'s plans and efforts to capture [[Joseph Kony]]. It describes Kony's actions with his rebel militia group [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA), including [[Impressment|forced recruitment]] of [[child soldiers]], and the regions (northern [[Uganda]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[South Sudan]]) in which they have been active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altoona.psu.edu/now/news.php?value=3646 |title=KONY 2012, an Invisible Children film, to show on campus March 12 |accessdate=March 7, 2012 |date=March 5, 2012 |publisher=[[Penn State Altoona]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310034444/http://www.altoona.psu.edu/now/news.php?value=3646 |archivedate=March 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main people featured in the film is a young Ugandan named Jacob Avaye, whose brother was killed by the LRA. In response, director and founder of Invisible Children, [[Jason Russell]], promises Jacob that he will help "stop Kony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Celebs Help 'Stop Kony' Trend on Twitter: Who Is Kony? |author=Jenny McGrath |url=http://www.wetpaint.com/network/articles/celebs-help-stop-kony-tweet-on-twitter-who-is-kony |newspaper=[[Wetpaint]] |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film advocates the restoration of social order and curtailing compelled and coerced [[Military use of children|youth military service]].&lt;ref name=JCTSK/&gt; The video also has clips of Jason Russell's young son reacting to the information about Kony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cunningham |first=Todd |url=http://www.thewrap.com/media/article/kony-2012-part-ii-beyond-famous-takes-warlord-and-critics-36822 |title='Kony 2012: Part II - Beyond Famous' Takes on Warlord and Critics |publisher=Thewrap.com |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the film, a 2011 announcement from U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] is shown authorizing the deployment of 100 [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] military advisers to provide "information, advice, and assistance to partner nation forces" of [[Central Africa]]n countries to "remove Joseph Kony from the battlefield".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Uganda: Obama Sends U.S. Military Advisers to Help Track LRA's Kony |author=Jim Lobe |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201110150156.html |newspaper=[[AllAfrica]] |date=October 15, 2011 |accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video concludes by urging viewers to join its publicity campaign by putting up posters and helping out in their communities.&lt;ref name=YouTube&gt;{{cite video|year=2012 |title=KONY 2012 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4MnpzG5Sqc |medium=Motion picture |publisher=Invisible Children |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invisible Children==
The Invisible Children charity has focused on obtaining the support of a select group of individuals in order to "help bring awareness to the abuse and killing of children in the [[East Africa|East]] and Central African countries at the hands of Kony and his leadership." This list included 20 "celebrity culture makers", such as [[George Clooney]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Oprah Winfrey]] (who significantly helped to spread the video&lt;ref name=numbers/&gt;), [[Taylor Swift]] and [[Ryan Seacrest]].&lt;ref name="E!"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012: George Clooney, Angelina Jolie and You Asked to Save Africa's Invisible Children From Torture |author=Rebecca Macatee |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/kony_2012_george_clooney_angelina_jolie/299424 |publisher=[[E!]] |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Basulto |first=Dominic |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/post/clooney-kony-soldiers-spy-satellites-celebrity-philanthropy-goes-high-tech/2012/03/30/gIQADM0MlS_blog.html |title=Clooney, Kony, soldier, spy: Celebrity activism goes high-tech&amp;nbsp;– Ideas@Innovations |work=The Washington Post |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list also featured 12 "policy makers" that have "the power to keep U.S. government officials in Africa" in order to work toward the capture of Kony. This list includes former U.S. President [[George W.

As part of the campaign, American supporters were asked to put up posters in their hometowns in an action named "Cover the Night", which took place on April 20, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Harris in New York |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/13/kony-2012-invisble-children-day-of-action |title=Kony 2012 organisers plan massive day of action across US cities |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 22, 2012 |date=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invisible Children website offers posters and T-shirts in an attempt to gain wider recognition. They also created action kits to help spread awareness that include campaign buttons, posters, bracelets and stickers.&lt;ref name="Lees0307"/&gt;

The "Cover the Night" event took place worldwide on April 20, 2012, and was to be conducted by supporters who were encouraged to perform some sort of charity work that morning in their local community. Then, that evening, they were to post flyers and posters throughout their city for the Kony 2012 campaign. The turnout for the event worldwide was much smaller than initially expected, with no organized spots officially announced and much fewer people attending than had pledged to attend. A tweet from Invisible Children stated, "There is no official meet-up as we are asking people to act locally with friends+family {{sic}} in their neighborhoods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Catch Kony campaign loses couch potatoes |author=Nick Miller |url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/catch-kony-campaign-loses-couch-potatoes-20120421-1xdqc.html |newspaper=The Age |date=April 22, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One gathering in [[Vancouver]] had only 17 people; another in [[Brisbane]] had fewer than 50 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 campaign fails to go offline in Vancouver |author=Mike Hager |url=http://www.globaltvbc.com/kony+2012+campaign+fails+to+go+offline+in+vancouver/6442625789/story.html |newspaper=[[Global BC]] |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=KONY 2012's struggle to remain visible |author=Chris Paine |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/kony-2012-how-the-phenomenon-faded/story-e6freuzr-1226334893369 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kelowna]], [[British Columbia]], several signs and posters were put up, including two large banners that were "placed on both sides of the pedestrian overpass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kelowna makes Kony famous|url=http://www.kelownacapnews.com/news/148386225.html |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canberra]], several [[Facebook]] groups resulted in a few gatherings of two or three people each; [[Pierre Johannessen]], a "law firm partner who runs a charity for disadvantaged children", distributed around 3,000 posters to the groups to be put up throughout the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 poster boy for Civic unrest |author=Douglas Fry |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/kony-2012-poster-boy-for-civic-unrest-20120421-1xebl.html |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=April 22, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], 200 posters were put up by "college students and other people in their teens and 20s", along with a number of chalk and stencil messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 supporters 'cover the night' in downtown Phoenix |url=http://downtowndevil.com/2012/04/21/26874/kony-2012-phoenix-uganda/ |newspaper=Downtown Devil |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clear left}}

==Reception==
The film sparked a heated controversy regarding its merits, with very differing opinions being expressed by various [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] workers, government and international officials, journalists, and other groups and individuals.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/efforts-arrest-joseph-kony-must-respect-human-rights-2012-03-08 |title=Efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect human rights |publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WTF Was Kony 2012?

=== Social Media Response ===
After the video was released, various social media outlets went into a frenzy and exploded the Kony 2012 movement into the world-wide news.  The video, directed by [[Jason Russell]], began to generate a tremendous amount of social media attention.  After being the quickest video to reach 100 million views within 6 days,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kony 2012 took over social media with hashtags like #Kony2012.

In under a week, the video created by Invisible Children, Kony 2012 had been viewed over 100 million times.&lt;ref name="newsfeed.time.com"&gt;http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/03/12/kony-2012-documentary-becomes-most-viral-video-in-history/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' magazine credits Invisible Children's strong base of followers on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Unlike other videos that accidentally "go viral", Kony 2012 was created to elicit emotional responses and encourage viewers to share the footage and spread the hashtag. This attracted the attention of celebrities like [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Rihanna]], [[Bill Gates]], [[Ryan Seacrest]], [[Justin Bieber]], and [[Kim Kardashian-West]].&lt;ref name="newsfeed.time.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;https://www.npr.org/2014/06/14/321853244/the-kony-2012-effect-recovering-from-a-viral-sensation&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the video's popularity, not all interactions were positive. But the more criticism the video drew, the more people watched it and shared it so that they could be a part of the conversation. Their Public Relations team was not ready for the over night fame and failed to control the narrative of the fall out.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

Forbes gives a breakdown of 12 reasons why the video went so viral. They cite that the video invoked positive feelings, grabbed viewers attention, made it personal, referenced mainstream media, pulled on the heartstrings, conveyed immediacy, made it simple, made it real, gave it a scale, used celebrities, created events, and made it easy to get involved.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/03/09/12-lessons-from-kony-2012-from-social-media-power-users/#45f979dd4328&lt;/ref&gt; These 12 basic tactics affected viewers so much so that the Kony 2012 campaign sold out of merchandise when their two interns could not keep up with the hundreds of thousands of action kits supporters could buy. Jason Russel told Business Insider, "We sourced every single red T-shirt in the entire US.

[[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW)'s Africa division senior researcher [[Anneke Van Woudenberg]] wrote in a statement: "We've spent years investigating the horrors perpetrated by the LRA in central Africa—Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, [[Central African Republic]] (CAR), and South Sudan.

Erwin van der Borght, the organization's Africa director, wrote in a statement: "Joseph Kony and other LRA leaders have evaded arrest for far too long and this campaign is a salient reminder of the continuing crimes by LRA members and the need to arrest and surrender their leaders to the ICC so they can face trial," but added: "Anyone joining the Kony 2012 campaign should insist that efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect [[human rights]]", especially because "many of LRA members were themselves victims of human rights violations including forcible recruitment", and ensure the protection of civilians.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"/&gt;

Opinions on the film were mixed in [[Gulu]], one of former centers of rebel activities in northern Uganda, during a showing of the film, with several of the leaders expressing support and criticism. One of the attendees, State Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Henry Oryem Okello]], said that the criticisms directed at the film and Invisible Children were "unfounded", going on to state, "Invisible Children has done visible things in [[Acholi]][land], for example offering scholarships to thousands of children and anyone against them is our enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 video divides opinion in Gulu |author1=Sam Lawino |author2=Moses Akena |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/1369072/-/ax98g6z/-/ |newspaper=Saturday Monitor |date=March 19, 2012 |accessdate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Betty Bigombe]], a Ugandan cabinet minister and former peace negotiator, said, "I do not know whether it makes any difference as far as taking [Kony] out is concerned.

Journalist [[Nicholas D.

He also said that complexity had long been "a leading excuse for inaction during atrocities" and that Kony remains a threat in Uganda's neighbour countries, so the simplicity of the film "has left the American public more informed" than it would be otherwise, and that if he "were a Congolese villager", he would "welcome these uncertain efforts over the sneering scorn of do-nothing armchair cynics."&lt;ref name=Kristof&gt;{{cite news |title=Viral Video, Vicious Warlord |author=[[Nicholas D.

Mikaela Luttrell-Rowland from [[Clark University]]'s Strassler Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies stated that it was "irresponsible to prize feel good, simplistic messages over complex history and to treat [[consumerism|consumerist]]-consciousness raising as interchangeable with education."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mikaela-luttrellrowland/consumerism-trumps-educat_b_1337067.html Consumerism Trumps Education: The Kony 2012 Campaign], ''Huffington Post'', November 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Africa researcher [[Alex de Waal]] accused the film of "peddling dangerous and patronizing falsehoods," criticized the campaign as "naive" for "elevating Kony to a global celebrity, the embodiment of evil," that might only help him as a terrorist and cult leader, and called for instead "demystifying Kony—reducing him to a common criminal and a failed provincial politician."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.tufts.edu/reinventingpeace/2012/03/10/dont-elevate-kony/ |title=Don't Elevate Kony &amp;#124; Reinventing Peace |publisher=Sites.tufts.edu |date=March 10, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One point of criticism is that the film gives a misleading impression of the whereabouts and magnitude of Kony's remaining LRA forces. As of early 2012, Kony's followers were thought to number only in the hundreds, and Kony himself was believed to be in the Central African Republic rather than Uganda—a fact that receives only a passing mention in the video.&lt;ref name="Keating20120307"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/03/07/guest_post_joseph_kony_is_not_in_uganda_and_other_complicated_things |title=Guest post: Joseph Kony is not in Uganda (and other complicated things) |accessdate=March 8, 2012|date=March 7, 2012|work=Foreign Policy|author=Keating, Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem raised questions about the plausibility of Ugandan army intervention, which the video advocates. Since Kony and most of the LRA forces are currently not in Uganda, the Ugandan army would need to coordinate with the governments and militaries of the other countries where the LRA is active.&lt;ref name=infamous&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/08/148239201/joseph-kony-is-now-a-star-but-will-he-be-caught | title=Joseph Kony is Infamous&amp;nbsp;– But will he be caught? | publisher=NPR | accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dinaw Mengestu]], an [[Ethiopian American]] writer and Africa researcher, wrote that the real world Kony is "not a click away", and a simple solution of raising popular awareness, "a beautiful equation that can only work so long as we believe that nothing in the world happens unless we know about it&amp;nbsp;... only works in the [[Myopia|myopic]] reality of the film, a reality that deliberately eschews depth and complexity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warscapes.com/reportage/not-click-away-joseph-kony-real-world |title=Not a Click Away: Joseph Kony in the Real World |publisher=Warscapes |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Amanda Weisbaum of the charity [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] said that "just getting rid of one person does not solve the problem" and the film's focus should have been rather on helping ex-child soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trust.org/alertnet/blogs/technotalk/not-enough-focus-on-child-soldiers-lives-in-kony-2012-war-child/ |title=Not enough focus on child soldiers’ lives in "Kony 2012" -War Child&amp;nbsp;– AlertNet |publisher=Trust.org |date=April 4, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705072012/http://www.trust.org/alertnet/blogs/technotalk/not-enough-focus-on-child-soldiers-lives-in-kony-2012-war-child |archivedate=July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Goddard, president and CEO of [[ChildFund|ChildFund International]], wrote that "by narrowing the focus on Kony, by defining success so singularly, it gives people a greater sense that the issue [of globally widespread conscription of young children] can be resolved.

After the film's release, there was criticism in Uganda of its failure to state more clearly that Kony and his forces fled northern Uganda in 2006 and were dispersed across the jungles of three neighbouring countries. Fred Opolot, spokesman for the Ugandan government, said, "It is totally misleading to suggest that the war is still in Uganda."&lt;ref name="pflanz"/&gt; Arthur Larok, [[ActionAid]]'s director in Uganda, said, "It doesn't sound like a fair representation of Uganda.

A March 2012 mass showing of the film in [[Lira, Uganda|Lira]], the site of one of Kony's worst atrocities in Uganda, was met with jeering and thrown objects at the screen and at the group African Youth Initiative Network, which screened the film and provided translations.

Mahmood Mamdani, director of the Institute of Social Research at [[Makerere University]], [[Kampala]], argued that the LRA is "a Ugandan problem calling for a Ugandan political solution" and against "mobilisation of millions [to] be subverted into yet another weapon in the hands of those who want to further militarise the region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/03/20123138139642455.html |title=Kony: What Jason did not tell the Invisible Children&amp;nbsp;– Opinion|publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ugandan journalist Rosebell Kagumire said that "the war is much more complex than one man called Joseph Kony."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/mar/08/kony-2012-what-s-the-story |title=Kony 2012: what's the real story? |publisher=theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent showing of ''Kony 2012'' at Pece War Memorial Stadium in Gulu, Uganda sparked a riot in which dozens of people were injured. The archbishop of Gulu, Rt Rev. John Baptist Odama, was reported as saying that the video "has ill motives and geared towards igniting anger in the population to cause violence." Margaret Aciro, whose picture appears in the video showing her face mutilated by the LRA, said she "became sad" after seeing it being "used to profit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/1387926/-/aw2cd3z/-/index.html |title=Kony 2012 video makers using us to make profit, war victim says - National |publisher=monitor.co.ug |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Ernest Sugule, national coordinator of the Congolese non-governmental organization SAIPD in [[Dungu, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Dungu, DRC]], claimed that the few people there "who have succeeded in watching [''Kony 2012''] are very critical on the film," as is he himself.&lt;ref name=next/&gt; Charlie Beckett, a media communications expert at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), said Invisible Children, "haven't got the capacity for is to take that beyond another action.

===Decline of the Movement===



The fame of director [[Jason Russell]]'s 30-minute documentary was short-lived. After becoming the fastest video in history to have reached 100 million views,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wasserman|first1=Todd|title='KONY 2012' Tops 100 Million Views, Becomes the Most Viral Video in History [STUDY]|url=http://mashable.com/2012/03/12/kony-most-viral/#0IHt2sGJXEqF|accessdate=18 October 2017|agency=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt; the popularity of the video dwindled&amp;nbsp;– in 5&amp;nbsp;years it had added less than 1/50 of its views it had garnered in its first 144 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KONY 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4MnpzG5Sqc|website=YouTube|publisher=Invisible Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Occupy Wall Street]], the climb toward the most popular peak of the movement lasted 3 months&amp;nbsp;– from August 2011 to October 2011&lt;ref&gt;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2010-10-03%202017-11-03&amp;q=%23occupywallstreet&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Visible Children also criticized the Kony 2012 movement for making Joseph Kony "famous", citing Ugandan opinions that even more supporters rallied behind Kony for publicity. Delinquent acts of graffiti from the movement's followers and lewd acts by creator Jason Russell led to further criticism of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holt|first1=Mytheos|title=‘Kony 2012’: Viral Video’s Filmmaker Arrested for Lewd Acts|url=http://www.theblaze.com/news/2012/03/16/scandals-dog-kony-2012-graffiti-appears-in-texas-originator-arrested-for-lewd-acts/|accessdate=18 October 2017|agency=The Blaze|date=March 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the movement's nature as a meme transformed it to be unattractive platform for some to donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=Katie|title=Think Twice Before Donating to Kony 2012, the Charitable Meme du Jour|url=https://jezebel.com/5891269/think-twice-before-donating-to-kony-2012-the-meme-du-jour|accessdate=18 October 2017|agency=jezebel|publisher=gizmodo|date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invisible Children's response===
On March 8, 2012, Invisible Children released an official response addressing the criticisms directed at ''Kony 2012''. As an explanation for the simplicity of the movie, they stated that "in [their] quest to garner wide public support of nuanced policy, [they] sought to explain the conflict in an easily understandable format." Jedidiah Jenkins, the director of idea development for Invisible Children, responded to the new criticisms by saying that they were "myopic" and that the video itself was a "tipping point" that "got young people to care about an issue on the other side of the planet that doesn't affect them."&lt;ref name="Post1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Invisible Children responds to criticism about 'Stop Kony' campaign |author=Elizabeth Flock |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/invisible-childrens-stop-kony-campaign/2012/03/07/gIQA7B31wR_blog.html?wprss=blogpost |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to concerns about working with the Ugandan government, Invisible Children explained that they "do not defend any of the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Ugandan government or the Ugandan army". They added that the reason why they are working with the Ugandan army even though Kony is no longer in Uganda is that the army is "more organized and better equipped than that of any of the other affected countries (DRC, South Sudan, CAR) to track down Joseph Kony" and that they want all of the governments in the region to work together to arrest Kony.&lt;ref name="Invisible Children Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Invisible Children Critiques |url=http://www.invisiblechildren.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/critiques.html |accessdate=March 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308102109/http://www.invisiblechildren.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/critiques.html |archivedate=March 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins stated, "There is a huge problem with [[political corruption]] in Africa.

A video titled ''Thank you, KONY 2012 Supporters'' was released on March 12, 2012 to address the criticisms directed at the film and to be "fully transparent", according to Invisible Children CEO Ben Keesey. The film begins with Keesey discussing the three things that the charity focuses on, which are to "create films with compelling narratives, promote international advocacy and run on-the-ground initiatives." He also points out that "overhead and travel costs are essential to those efforts", as a part of the group's management expenses, along with going toward "thousands of free screenings of the group's films worldwide, as well as toward bringing survivors of the Lord's Resistance Army&amp;nbsp;... to speak at these events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Invisible Children Releases New Video in Response to ‘Kony 2012’ Criticism |author=Samantha Grossman |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/03/12/invisible-children-releases-new-video-in-response-to-kony-2012-criticism/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 12, 2012 |accessdate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keesey explains the way the charity's annual expenditures are made, with "80.5 percent to 85.7 percent of total annual spending from fiscal 2007 to 2011" going toward {{"'}}program expenses'—money that directly benefits their cause",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Joseph Kony 2012: Invisible Children release new film responding to criticism |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/joseph-kony/9139970/Joseph-Kony-2012-Invisible-Children-release-new-film-responding-to-criticism.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=March 13, 2012 |accessdate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finished by urging interested parties to make inquires to the group via [[Twitter]], using the account @invisible and hashtag #AskICAnything.

===Reception===
In a pre-release comment, [[popular culture]] expert [[Robert Thompson (professor)|Robert Thompson]] said: "The fact is, the story has developed in so many odd ways with all the controversy, and the sequel can't really promise the bang of that first video—which is informing people of something they did not know before.

==Impact==

===United States===
On March 21, 2012, a resolution "condemning Joseph Kony and his ruthless guerrilla group for a 26-year campaign of terror" was put forward by [[United States Senate|Senators]] [[Jim Inhofe]] and [[Chris Coons]]. The resolution stated that it would back "the effort of Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and the newest country, South Sudan, to stop Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army", along with an official statement of support "for the U.S. effort to help regional forces pursue commanders of the militia group." Overall, the resolution received support from 34 senators, both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Senate pushes measure condemning Kony |author=Donna Cassata |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2012/03/21/senate_pushes_measure_condemning_kony/|date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate=March 2, 2015 |work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Politico"&gt;{{cite news |title=Joseph Kony captures Congress' attention |author=Scott Wong |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74355.html |newspaper=[[Politico]] |date=March 22, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support among senators for the resolution came about after the release of the ''Kony 2012'' video and its subsequent popularity. One of the resolution leaders, Senator Chris Coons, became aware of the situation after his daughters asked him what he was doing to stop Kony and Senator [[Roy Blunt]] was informed "at a Missouri caucus in St. Louis when a constituent quizzed him about Kony". One of the co-sponsors of the resolution, Senator [[Lindsey Graham]], stated that, "When you get 100 million Americans looking at something, you will get our attention. This YouTube sensation is gonna help the Congress be more aggressive and will do more to lead to his demise than all other action combined."&lt;ref name="Politico"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19407">In March 2015, media reports appeared showing  email messages sent by German Professor [[Annette Beck-Sickinger]], the head of the biochemistry department at [[Leipzig University]], to an anonymous male internship applicant from India. According to the released email texts, Beck-Sickinger does not accept ''“any Indian male students for internships”'', and ''“many female professors in Germany decided to no longer accept male Indian students”''. She references India's "rape problem" as the reason for not accepting any Indian male applicant for internships. Beck-Sickinger has described the released text as taken out of context but says she "made a mistake" in the incident.&lt;ref name="post" /&gt; Subsequently, an additional anonymous Indian student released emails that appeared to show similar commentary made by Beck-Sickinger in 2014.&lt;ref name="indep" /&gt;

The alleged messages were publicly condemned in an open letter from [[Germany-India relations|German ambassador to India]] [[Michael Steiner]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osborne|first1=Louise|title=German professor rebuked for rejecting intern over 'India's rape problem'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/09/german-professor-rebuked-for-discrimination-over-indias-problem|website=The Guardian|accessdate=23 March 2015|date=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident occurred shortly before a scheduled [[List of Prime Ministerial trips made by Narendra Modi|official visit]] by Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] at the invitation of German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacob|first1=Jayanth|title=PM Modi to visit Germany in April for better ties, Merkel to reciprocate|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-visit-germany-in-april-for-better-ties-merkel-to-reciprocate/article1-1293740.aspx|website=Hindustan Times|accessdate=23 March 2015|date=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First disclosure – 2015 ==

Reports alleging that a university professor in Germany does not accept ''“any Indian male students for internships”'', and that ''“many female professors in Germany decided to no longer accept male Indian students”''&lt;ref name="indept"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-professor-rejects-indian-student-due-to-the-countrys-rape-problem-10095607.html|title=German Professor rejects Indian student due to the country's 'rape|date=9 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; surfaced on social media in early March 2015. Screen-shots of e-mails, allegedly sent by [[Annette Beck-Sickinger]] of the Institute of Biochemistry at Leipzig University, appeared to show that she explained her actions by reference to India's '[[Rape culture|culture of rape]]'.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/03/09/german-professor-triggers-controversy-by-citing-indias-rape-problem-in-e-mail-to-rejected-indian-applicant/ German professor cites India’s ‘rape problem’ in rejection of Indian applicant (Washington Post)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/germany-professor-denies-indian-internship-citing-his-countrys-rape-problem-1491209|title=Germany: Professor denies Indian internship citing his country's 'rape problem'|date=9 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; News reports stated that Huffington Post India contacted Prof. Beck-Sickinger who confirmed that the e-mails were real but insists that they were taken out of context.&lt;ref name="indept" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2015/03/09/leipzig-university-apolog_n_6829270.html|title=German Professor Is Sorry That She Cited India's 'Rape Problem' To Deny An Internship|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 2015, the German ambassador to India, [[Michael Steiner]], rebuked Beck-Sickinger's opinions as oversimplified and discriminative.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Steiner's apology contrasted that of the rector of Leipzig University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zv.uni-leipzig.de/en/service/press-office/press-releases.html?ifab_modus=detail&amp;ifab_uid=11d867796d20150309125530&amp;ifab_id=5954 Biochemie-Professorin Annette Beck-Sickinger entschuldigt sich für Äußerungen (University Leipzig) German] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910212106/http://www.zv.uni-leipzig.de/en/service/press-office/press-releases.html?ifab_modus=detail&amp;ifab_uid=11d867796d20150309125530&amp;ifab_id=5954 |date=2015-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bildung/nach-ablehnung-von-indischem-bewerber-praesidentin-der-uni-leipzig-haelt-zu-professorin-1.2391846|title=Nach Ablehnung von indischem Bewerber: Rektorin der Uni Leipzig hält an Professorin fest|publisher=|via=Sueddeutsche.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Beate Schücking]], who offered support for Beck-Sickinger's apology: ''“Her comments on the issue of violence against women in India were not her first answer but were made in reply to a provocative e-mail which followed the initial e-mail. To say it clearly: I do not tolerate these comments. However, I accept Professor Beck-Sickinger's apology. And I can say: the published e-mail has obviously been faked.”''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zv.uni-leipzig.de/service/presse/nachrichten.html?ifab_modus=detail&amp;ifab_id=5962|title=Universität Leipzig: Nachrichten|first=Universität|last=Leipzig|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.dw.de/english/mobile.A-18305964-9097.html India's 'rape problem' a problem for Leipzig University (Deutsche Welle) 10 March 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428215234/http://m.dw.de/english/mobile.A-18305964-9097.html |date=28 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beate Schücking refused to speculate about consequences because the issue was currently being reviewed internally by her office and the Council of Deans and would be subject to review by the Academic Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nachricht 075/2015 Statement of the rector of Leipzig University|url=http://www.zv.uni-leipzig.de/en/service/press-office/press-releases.html?ifab_modus=detail&amp;ifab_uid=42a85a010220150323151825&amp;ifab_id=5962|agency=Pressestelle|publisher=Leipzig University|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Prof. Schücking, the students council of the Leipzig University had the chance to review all relevant e-mails. A statement was published saying that the student was rejected for formal reasons and in reply to the refusal, the student provoked a discussion about social and cultural problems in India. The mail which was initially published by the student is claimed to be fake, or a "mashup",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stura.uni-leipzig.de/news/statement-der-causa-beck-sickinger|title=Statement in der Causa Beck-Sickinger|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in earlier press reports&lt;ref name="indept" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huff" /&gt; the professor herself is reported to have confirmed that the mail is not a hoax.

While Leipzig University has declined to release the full text of the emails due to privacy issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-31834228|title=Second student allegedly rejected because of India's 'rape problem' - BBC News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it released a statement in which it explained that the applicant had been rejected because there were no further internship openings, but had continued to converse with Beck-Sickinger by email. Beck-Sickinger released a statement in which she apologized for the incident, said she had "made a mistake", and pointed out that Indian students were members of both her research group and the internship program, but did not specify their genders.&lt;ref name="post" /&gt;

== Second disclosure – 2014 ==

In the wake of the incident, a second anonymous Indian man alleged that he had previously been rejected by [[Beck-Sickinger]] as a PhD candidate in early 2014.&lt;ref name="indep"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/second-indian-student-rejected-by-german-professor-because-of-indias-rape-problem-10103373.html|title=Another student says he was rejected by a German professor 'because of India's rape problem'|date=12 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These emails allegedly contained the text:&lt;ref name=bbctrending&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wendling|first1=Michael|title=Second student allegedly rejected because of India's 'rape problem'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-31834228|website=BBC Trending|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 March 2015|date=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|''thanks a lot for your application. Unfortunately I do no longer accept any male Indian guests, trainees, doctorial students or PostDocs due to the severe rape problem in India. I cannot support a society which is not able to respect females in any aspects. I think cultured people cannot close their eyes.''}}

The university responded to the second set of allegations, saying that Beck-Sickinger had deleted the message in question and that she denies having responded as claimed.&lt;ref name="bbctrending" /&gt;

==Reactions==
{{See also|Germany–India relations}}

=== Political===
Junior minister of the Indian Government, Minister of State for External Affairs (Independent Charge) [[V. K. Singh]], said that the incident was the result of 'misunderstanding' of India and hoped that the matter could be resolved at the earliest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/german-prof-email-row-minister-blames-misunderstanding-115031000611_1.html|title=German prof email row: VK Singh cites misunderstanding as cause|first=Press Trust of|last=India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Tariq Anwar said: ''“If such comment has been made, then it is condemnable.

The political response to the incident in Germany has been muted despite the global media coverage. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, an alumnus of Leipzig University, has not commented on the incident. Saxony Regional Minister of Science, Eva-Maria Stange, said: ''“I assume that Professor Beck-Sickinger no intention to hurt the feelings of the Indian students.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sz-online.de/sachsen/leipziger-professorin-lehnt-indischen-praktikanten-ab-3055224.html|title=Leipziger Professorin lehnt indischen Praktikanten ab|first=|last=sz-online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migazin.de/2015/03/13/je-suis-vergewaltiger/|title=Einwurf - Je suis Vergewaltiger - MiGAZIN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomatic===

German ambassador to India [[Michael Steiner]] responded to the incident with an [[open letter]], excerpted below, addressed to Beck-Sickinger.
 
:''“Your oversimplifying and discriminating generalisation is an offence to women and men ardently committed to furthering women's empowerment in India; and is an offence to millions of law-abiding, tolerant, open-minded and hard-working Indians. Let's be clear: India is not a country of rapists,”''

:''“The [[2012 Delhi gang rape|2012 Nirbhaya rape]] case has refocused attention on the issue of violence against women. Rape is indeed a serious issue in India as in most countries, [[Rape in Germany|including Germany]]. In India, the Nirbhaya case has triggered lively, honest, sustained and very healthy public debate - a public debate of a quality that wouldn't be possible in many other countries,”''.

:''“I would encourage you to learn more about the diverse, dynamic and fascinating country and the many welcoming and open-minded people of India so that you could correct a simplistic image, which – in my opinion – is particularly unsuitable for a professor and teacher.”''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-is-not-a-country-of-rapists-german-envoy-to-discriminating-german-professor/article6975221.ece?homepage=true|title=India is not a country of rapists: German envoy to discriminating German professor|date=9 March 2015|publisher=|via=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20150309/professor-causes-india-spat-over-rape-problem|title=Prof rejects Indian intern over 'rape problem'|date=9 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/german-professor-apologises-denying-internship-indian-student-citing-rape-problem-625708|title=German Professor Apologises for Denying Internship to Indian Student, Citing 'Rape Problem'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150309/world-europe/article/german-professor-denies-internship-indian-student-citing-india%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98rape|title=German professor denies internship to Indian student citing India’s ‘rape problem’|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-professor-apologizes-for-rape-problem-email-to-indian-student/article1-1324468.aspx|title=German prof apologises for 'India's rape problem' mail to student|date=9 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic ===

The incident gave rise to commentaries by European academics who scrutinized the underlying issues raised by the incident: persistence of a colonial mind-set in Europe, an anti-Indian bias in European media, the philosophical justification for an indiscriminate academic embargo, an overview of sex related crimes in Europe, and the human rights situation in Germany with regard to discrimination and treatment of minority groups in Germany.

* ''A professor in Germany is a civil servant of the German state. Is it suitable for a civil servant of the German state to be openly racist?'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/et-commentary/now-a-crusading-racist-alias-a-german-professor-on-the-generic-rapist/|title=Now, a crusading racist alias a German professor on the generic rapist|date=12 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; - Benjamin Zachariah, Historian, University of Heidelberg, Germany
* ''India and the West could together look for solutions to the problems that we share. Instead, Western commentators reproduce old colonial stories about India as an immoral culture. This gives them a twisted relationship to the Indian people. On the one hand, they keep turning towards the same class of Indian journalists, activists, and intellectuals for ‘local knowledge’. But these native informants merely talk the talk of the West to the West. On the other hand, more and more Indians are disgusted by the West’s condescending attitude towards their country. And this is then dismissed as hurt pride. If we want to bring our two peoples and cultures closer together in this new age, reason and empathy are our only hope. The madness of the current discourse about India must end.''  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niticentral.com/2015/03/11/indias-daughter-and-bbc-belgian-professor-speaks-out-306333.html India’s Daughter and BBC – Belgian Professor speaks out (Jakob De Roover, University of Ghent, Belgium)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313141816/http://www.niticentral.com/2015/03/11/indias-daughter-and-bbc-belgian-professor-speaks-out-306333.html |date=2015-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; - Jakob De Roover, University of Ghent, Belgium

Ranjan Ghosh, a lecturer at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences at Uppsala, and who formerly taught in Germany opined that the incident was most likely an isolated incident. Ranjan Ghosh acknowledged that despite regulations against any racial prejudice being stringent in Germany, after the ''[[2012 Delhi gang rape|Nirbhaya]]'' case, Indians are increasingly confronted with questions about India’s rape situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Germany has much to offer in education for Indian students|url=http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/globalindian/germany-has-much-to-offer-in-education-for-indian-students/|publisher=The Economic Times|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident is seen as a fallout from biased views of India in Western media and comes on the heels of the controversy surrounding the release of the BBC documentary film about the [[2012 Delhi gang rape]] called ''[[India's Daughter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21646271-stifling-debate-about-social-problems-politicians-make-them-harder-solve-how-damage-indias|title=How to damage India’s reputation|publisher=|via=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why to blacken India on rape do they have to omit the facts?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/11472416/Why-to-blacken-India-on-rape-do-they-have-to-omit-the-facts.html|agency=The Telegraph|date=14 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social Media ===

Social media called upon university authorities in Germany to offer an unconditional apology.&lt;ref name="niticentral.com"&gt;[http://www.niticentral.com/2015/03/09/german-racism-meets-german-sanctimony-over-indias-daughter-306032.html German Racism meets German Sanctimony over India’s Daughter (Niti Central)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722054302/http://www.niticentral.com/2015/03/09/german-racism-meets-german-sanctimony-over-indias-daughter-306032.html |date=2015-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kbzk.com/story/28348033/german-prof-apologizes-for-comments-about-rape-in-india-to-rejected-candidate German prof apologizes for comments about rape in India to rejected candidate (KBZK)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2988666/WHIPLASH-Nirbhaya-shame-continues-haunt-India.html|title=WHIPLASH: The Nirbhaya shame continues to haunt India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public response in India, whilst unanimous in condemning Beck-Sickinger's comments and allegations of an academic boycott, were also severely critical of efforts undertaken by the government to prevent horrendous crimes, including rapes, in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Letters to editor|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1150316/jsp/opinion/story_8846.jsp#.VQbOFY5N2So|publisher=The Telegraph, Calcutta|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''London Conference (1939)''', or ''St James's Palace Conference'', which took place between 7 February-17 March 1939, was called by the [[Fourth National ministry|British Government]] to plan the future governance of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and an end of the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate]]. It opened on 7 February 1939 in [[St James's Palace]] after which the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]], [[Malcolm MacDonald]] held a series of separate meetings with an Arab and a Jewish delegation, because the Arab delegation refused to sit in the same room as the Jewish delegation. When MacDonald first announced the proposed conference he made clear that if no agreement was reached the government would impose a solution. The process came to an end after five and a half weeks with the British announcing proposals which were later published as the [[1939 White Paper]].

==Background==
On 1936 Arabs in Palestine went for a [[Palestinian general strike|1936 general strike]]. During the strike, Palestinian Arab leaders formed the [[Arab Higher Committee|Higher National Committee (HNC)]].

Following the strike the British Government established the [[Peel Commission]], chaired by [[William Peel, 1st Earl Peel|Lord Peel]], to investigate the causes of the general strike, and to make recommendations to the British government, in the light of commitments made in the [[Balfour Declaration]], to the establishment of a [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish National Home]] in Palestine. The commission concluded that the only solution was to partition the country into a Jewish State and an Arab State. The two main Jewish leaders, [[Chaim Weizmann]] and [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben Gurion]] had convinced the [[World Zionist Congress|Zionist Congress]] to approve equivocally the Peel recommendations as a basis for more negotiation.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.il"&gt;William Roger Louis, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Ends_of_British_Imperialism.html?id=NQnpQNKeKKAC&amp;redir_esc=y Ends of British Imperialism: The Scramble for Empire, Suez, and Decolonization], 2006, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2009, p. 66"&gt;Benny Morris, One state, two states:resolving the Israel/Palestine conflict,  2009, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benny Morris p. 48"&gt;Benny Morris,  [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Birth_of_the_Palestinian_Refugee_Pro.html?id=uM_kFX6edX8C&amp;redir_esc=y The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited],  p. 48; p. 11 "while the Zionist movement, after much agonising, accepted the principle of partition and the proposals as a basis for negotiation"; p. 49 "In the end, after bitter debate, the Congress equivocally approved – by a vote of 299 to 160 – the Peel recommendations as a basis for further negotiation."&lt;/ref&gt;

The partition idea that was rejected by the Arabs. On 1 October 1937, with a resurgence of violence following the publication of the Peel Commission proposals, the HNC and all nationalist committees were outlawed. Five prominent Palestinians, including three members of the HNC where deported to the [[Seychelles]]. The remaining members of the HNC were either already out of the country or like [[Haj Amin Husseini]] went into hiding and then into exile in Cairo, Damascus and Beirut.&lt;ref&gt;Abcarius. p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the summer of 1938, anti-government and inter-communal violence in Palestine reached new heights. Arab militants were in control of large areas of the countryside and controlled several towns including the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]], Jerusalem. The Jewish underground set off a series of lethal bombs in Arab markets across the country and the Jewish [[Special Night Squads]] launched their first operations.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen. pp. 210,211&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn the British authorities launched a counter-offensive. More British troops were sent and [[Martial Law]] was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Kayyali. pp. 214,215&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, a second [[Woodhead Commission|commission]] was sent to Palestine to report on how to implement the partition proposals. This commission, chaired by Sir John Woodhead, was boycotted by the Palestinian Arabs whose leaders had been deported or were in exile and who had no wish to discuss the partitioning of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Survey of Palestine, p. 47; Abcarius, p. 197; Cohen, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Woodhead Commission]] considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out).&lt;ref name="WoodheadReport1938"/&gt;  With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but emphasised serious problems with it that included a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the proposed Arab State.&lt;ref name="WoodheadReport1938"/&gt; The British Government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable due to "political, administrative and financial difficulties".&lt;ref&gt;Statement by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, Presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty November 1938. {{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/4941922311B4E3C585256D17004BD2E2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103061306/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/4941922311B4E3C585256D17004BD2E2 |archivedate=3 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinciding with the publication of the Woodhead Commission Report on 9 November 1938, the government issued a statement that it wished to end the Mandate, and that Britain would continue to govern Palestine until a new regime was established. To this end the Colonial Secretary, [[Malcolm MacDonald]] invited an Arab and a Jewish delegation to London to discuss what form of government should be established. The statement concluded that if agreement was not reached with the two delegations the government would put forward and implement its own proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab delegation was to include Palestinian Arabs as well as representatives from five, pro-British, Arab regimes. The Jewish delegation was selected by the [[Jewish Agency]] and included Jews from the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]] as well as the [[Yishuv]].

By the winter of 1938 British [[Munich Agreement|thinking]] was dominated by the territorial expansion of [[Nazi Germany]]. In the event of a European [[World War II|war]] it was essential that Britain maintained control over Egypt, Iraq and Palestine. It was certain that concessions would be offered to the Arabs and that the [[Zionists]] would be disappointed.&lt;ref&gt;Marlow. pp. 208, 219; Teveth, p. 697&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
[[File:Palestinian deportees in Seychelles.jpg|thumb|right|HNC leaders prior to their release from exile in the Seychelles, December 1938. Hussein al Khalidi seated left, Fuad Saba standing right. [[Ahmed Hilmi Pasha|Ahmad Hilmi]] centre.]]
Some Palestinian leaders welcomed the proposed conference but it soon became clear that there was not going to be any alternative to dealing with the disbanded [[Arab Higher Committee|Higher National Committee (HNC)]] and former [[Mufti]] of Jerusalem [[Haj Amin al-Husseini|Amin Husseini]]. On 23 November the Colonial Secretary, [[Malcolm MacDonald]], repeated his refusal to allow Amin Husseini to be a delegate, but announced his willingness to allow the five Palestinian leaders held in the [[Seychelles]] take part in the conference. This was part of an agreement made in London following informal meetings between MacDonald and [[Musa Alami]] to ensure a Palestinian Arab presence at the conference. MacDonald also assured Alami that the Mandate would be replaced with a treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Abcarius. p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The deportees were released on 19 December and allowed to travel to [[Cairo]] and then, with [[Jamal Husseini]], to [[Beirut]] where a new Higher National Committee was established. Amin Husseini, who was living in Beirut, was not a member of the resulting delegation but it was under his direction. This can be seen in the refusal to accept any delegates from the [[National Defence Party (Palestine)|National Defence Party (NDP)]]. Attempts to form an alternative, more pro-British and less militant, Palestinian delegation led to two additional NDP delegates being added to the Palestinian representation after the start of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe. pp. 209–215&lt;/ref&gt;

The five Arab regimes invited were the Kingdoms of [[Farouk of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ghazi of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Ibn Saud|Saudi Arabia]], and [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din|Yemen]], and the Emirate of [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Transjordan]] - all under the British sphere of influence. Egypt, Iraq and Saudi had been instrumental in ending the 1936 strike.&lt;ref&gt;Abcarius. p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zionists had reacted negatively to the proposed conference and debated whether they should attend.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen. p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Their delegation was led by [[Chaim Weizmann]] in the name of the [[Jewish Agency]]. To emphasise its claim to represent all Jews, and to counterbalance the presence of representatives from the Arab states, the delegation included members from the USA, Europe, Britain, South Africa, and Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe. pp. 214, 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference was opened by the Prime Minister, [[Neville Chamberlain]] on 7 February 1939 at [[St James's Palace]], London. The Arab delegation refused to attend any joint sessions with the Jewish Agency delegation so there were two ceremonies. This was at the insistence of the Palestinian Arab delegates.  The first ceremony, for the Arab delegation, was at 10.30 a.m., the second for the Jewish Agency delegation was at 11.45.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Zohar, p.94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teveth, ''Burning Ground.'' p.696; Marlowe. p.215.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meetings with the Arab Delegation==
The Palestinian Arab delegation was led by [[Jamal Husseini]] and consisted of [[Awni Abd al-Hadi]], [[Husayin al-Khalidi]], Alfred Roch and [[Musa Alami]]. They were accompanied by [[George Antonius]] and Fu'ad Saba who were to act as secretaries.&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian delegate was [[Ali Mahir Pasha|Aly Maher]] and Iraq was represented by its Prime Minister, [[Nuri Said]].&lt;ref&gt;Weizmann, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt; The Saudis were represented by Prince [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]] and Prince [[Khalid of Saudi Arabia|Khalid]], both future kings of Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palestinian delegates had meetings with the representatives from the Arab states in Cairo from 17 January. Despite pressure from the other delegates the Palestinian group refused to include any representatives from the National Defence Party (NDP) of [[Raghib al-Nashashibi]]. A campaign of violence between the rebels and supporters of the NDP led to 136 deaths in 1939. The NDP claimed to represent a majority of the upper classes and demanded representation at the London conference. The British let it be known that if agreement could not be reached they would talk to two Palestinian Arab delegations.  Raghib al-Nashashibi and Yacoub Farraj joined the Arab delegation two days after opening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe. p. 213; Survey. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Palestinian delegates refused to have any contact with the Jewish Agency delegation some meetings did take place with other Arab delegates (see below).

On 9 February Jamal Husseini put forward the Arab position:
* Independence
* No Jewish National Home in Palestine
* Replacement of the Mandate by a Treaty
* End to Jewish immigration&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe. p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

The first task the conference set itself was to establish the meaning of a series of letters, written in Arabic, during 1915–1916, between the [[Asquith coalition ministry|British Government]] and the governor of [[Mecca]], [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein bin Ali]]. Known as the [[McMahon-Hussein Correspondence|McMahon Correspondence]] they are credited with encouraging Husseini to call for an [[Arab Revolt|Arab revolt]] against the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]]. An Anglo-Arab committee was set up, with the [[Frederic Maugham, 1st Viscount Maugham|Lord Chancellor]] presiding, to examine the issue. An official version of the letters was published for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes. p. 205. An accurate translation had been printed in Antonius' "The Arab Awaking", 1938, as well as extracts in the [[Daily Mail]] in 1922&lt;/ref&gt; The committee concluded that the Arab perspective had been down-played and that, as of 1918, the British Government had no authority to ignore the views of the existing inhabitants of what was to become Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, pp. 200, 201&lt;/ref&gt; But the two sides failed to agree on the exact meaning of some of the territorial references, in particular whether "the parts of Syria extending west of [[Damascus]], [[Hamah]], [[Homs]] and [[Aleppo]] districts" included Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen. p. 232; Abcarius. p. 205; Survey. p. 50. "unable to reach agreement upon an interpretation of the correspondence."; Marlowe. p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

One option discussed with both delegations was the idea of a Jewish canton as part of a Greater Syria - this proposal was quickly rejected by both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes. pp. 203,204&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March a member of the Egyptian Foreign Ministry flew from Cairo to Beirut to try to get Amin Husseini to approve concessions being considered by the delegation. Husseini insisted that they continue rejecting the British proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe. p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March, having warned the delegation the day before, Colonial Secretary MacDonald read a statement outlining the British proposals and closed the conference. There had been fourteen British-Arab sessions. The British proposals were published two months later in what became known as the 1939 White Paper.&lt;ref&gt;Abcarius. pp. 205,206; Survey. p. 51; Marlowe. p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meetings with the Jewish Agency Delegation==

The [[Jewish Agency]] delegation was led by [[Chaim Weizmann]], chairman of the [[World Zionist Organization]], but it was [[David Ben Gurion]], leader of the [[Jewish Agency]], who dominated decision making. It was Ben Gurion who argued that the delegation should be in the name of the Jewish Agency rather than be called the Jewish delegation. But since they claimed to represent all Jews it included some non-Zionists such as [[Sholem Asch]] and [[Baron Melchett|Lord Melchett]], as well as the president of [[Agudat Yisrael]]. The Zionists from American included [[Rabbi Stephen Wise]] and [[Henrietta Szold]]. The British Zionists included [[Selig Brodetsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Israel Pocket Library, p. 70. Two pictures of delegations in identical poses.&lt;/ref&gt; A sign of Ben Gurion's power was his success in blocking [[Herbert Samuel|Lord Herbert Samuel's]] membership of the delegation.&lt;ref&gt;Teveth, ''The Burning Ground.'' p. 696; Cohen. p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Also attending were [[Moshe Sharett]], Doris May, Leonard Stein, [[Berl Katznelson]] and Blanch Dugdale.&lt;ref&gt;Teveth, ''Burning Ground.''  pp. 698, 705&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conference marked Ben Gurion becoming the prime mover in Zionist policy-making. It also saw a change in his thinking towards what he called "combatitive Zionism". He believed that the [[Yeshuv]] in Palestine was strong enough to defend itself. Out of a population of 440,000 around 45,000 were armed. His priority was that there should be continued and increased immigration. In particular young people of military age.&lt;ref&gt;Teveth, ''Burning Ground.'' pp. 681,699.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the opening ceremony the meetings were chaired by MacDonald. Weizmann's presentation of the Jewish Agency position reduced to four points:
* no minority status for the Jewish community in Palestine
* the Mandate to remain in place
* Jewish immigration to continue, governed by the capacity of the country to absorb the incomers
* investment to speed up development in Palestine&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe. pp. 215, 216&lt;/ref&gt;

The delegation was willing to accept the partition of the country, as recommended by the Peel Commission, but under protest. The 2 main Jewish leaders, [[Chaim Weizmann]] and [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben Gurion]] had convinced the [[World Zionist Congress|Zionist Congress]] to approve equivocally the Peel recommendations as a basis for more negotiation.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.il"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2009, p. 66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benny Morris p. 48"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sykes. pp. 202, 204; Abcarias. p. 197; Cohen. p, 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Palestinian Arab boycott of any meetings with Jewish Agency delegates some meetings did take place with Arab delegates. On the evening of 7 March the British managed to hold an informal meeting between three Arab deligates and four of the Jewish delegates with MacDonald and three other British officials present. The Egyptian delegate, [[Ali Mahir Pasha|Aly Maher]], appealed for a slowing down of Jewish immigration and an end to violence. Weizmann replied suggesting they might be able to find common ground but was interrupted by Ben Gurion who insisted that there could be no slow down. The meeting ended shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Zohar, pp. 96, 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien. p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

What went on in the closed meetings was difficult to keep secret. At one point the Jewish Agency delegation was upset by reports of a remark made to the Arab delegation by MacDonald which was taken to be anti-Semitic.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes. pp. 202, 203&lt;/ref&gt;

At the meeting on 24 February 1939 Ben Gurion laid out the Jewish Agency's minimum terms which were the continuation of the Mandate and the rejection of anything that would imply Jewish minority status. At the same meeting MacDonald announced the outlines of the British policy, which was that, after a transition period, Palestine would become an independent state allied to Britain and the Jewish minority would have protected status.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes. p. 204; Cohen pp. 213, 214; Marlowe. p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; On 26th both delegations received a written summary of what was planned. That evening the Jewish Agency delegation refused to attend a government ceremonial dinner in their honour. On 27 February the [[Mapai]] newspaper in Palestine, [[Davar]], published a cable from Ben Gurion: "There is a scheme afoot to liquidate the National Home and turn us over to the rule of gang leaders." On the same day a coordinated series of bombs across Palestine killed 38 Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;Survey. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The delegation refused to hold any further formal sessions and reduced its involvement to informal meetings in MacDonald's office.

[[St John Philby]], who was present as an advisor to the Saudi delegates, held a lunch at his home on 28 February with Weizmann, Ben Gurion and Faud Hamza, the Saudi foreign affairs official, at which Philby put forward his own proposals.

On 3 March Ben Gurion failed to get the delegation to disband and it was agreed that they should remain in London.&lt;ref&gt;Teveth, ''Burning Ground''. pp. 702, 703, 704&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 March Ben Gurion became ill and had to withdraw for several days.&lt;ref&gt;Teveth, ''Burning Ground''. p. 695.&lt;/ref&gt; By 16 March many of the delegates had left London.&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe. p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March Weizmann sent a letter to MacDonald: "The Jewish delegation, having given profound consideration to the proposals placed before it by His Majesty's Government on 15 March 1939, regrets that it is unable to accept them as a basis for agreement, and has therefore decided to disband." &lt;ref&gt;Bar-Zohar, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teveth, ''Burning Ground.''  p. 705.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome==
Two days before the end of the conference [[Hitler]]'s army began its occupation of [[Anschluss|Czechoslovakia]].

The Colonial Secretary's final proposals, which were published on 17 May 1939, were:
* A limit to Jewish immigration over the following five years after which numbers would be set by agreement with the Palestinian Arabs; restrictions on what parts of the country Jews could buy land.
* Gradual introduction of Palestinians, Jews and Arabs, into senior administrative posts.
* After a period of ten years the British would transfer all powers to a representative Government.

These proposals were conditional on the end of violence in Palestine. If after ten years no agreement had been reached about the form of government the British would reconsider the situation.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien. p. 238; Sykes. p. 207; Survey. pp. 90–99. Full text of White Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the delegations had left London the British made a further attempt to get Arab approval by suggesting a speeded up transfer of power, conditional on an end to violence, and involvement of the [[League of Nations]] if conditions were not right for independence after 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Survey. p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In May the HNC delegation announced its rejection of the White Paper, with Amin Husseini imposing the decision on the majority of delegates who were in favour of accepting. This was a tactical blunder which did not help the [[Arab National Council]] in any way. It is suggested that he had to refuse to deal with the British in order to maintain his leadership of the actual rebels in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi. pp. 115–117; Marlow. p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ben-Zvi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi|Ben Zvi]] addresses anti-White Paper demonstration, Jerusalem, 18 May 1939]]
On 17 April the [[Histadrut]] announced the launch of a campaign against the proposals. In the first month after the end of the conference over 1,700 Jewish illegal immigrants entered Palestine. On 17 May, to mark the publishing of the White Paper, telephone wires were cut and Government offices attacked. There were riots in Jerusalem. Jewish attacks on Arabs and Government property continued through the summer. The Jewish underground organisation, [[Irgun|Etzel]], claimed to have killed more than 130 people over this period.&lt;ref&gt;Survey. pp. 51–54; Segev, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an increase in illegal immigrants, with 6,323 arriving between April and October, leading to a peak in Jewish unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes. p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

In Zionist circles [[Herbert Samuel]] was accused of being responsible for some of the ideas in the White Paper.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes. p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Gurion wrote in his diary: "This is not the last word." He later claimed that the Prime Minister, [[Neville Chamberlain]], had explicitly told him that the policy would not outlive the war.&lt;ref&gt;Segev. p. 449&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MV ''Derbyshire''''' was an [[ore-bulk-oil carrier|ore-bulk-oil combination carrier]] built in 1976 by [[Swan Hunter]], as the last in the series of the [[Bridge-class OBO carrier|''Bridge''-class]] sextet. She was registered at [[Liverpool]] and owned by [[Bibby Line]].&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web|title=MV Derbyshire - HC Deb 03 July 1996 vol 280 cc883-904|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1996/jul/03/mv-derbyshire|website=www.hansard.millbanksystems.com|publisher=Hansard / House of Commons proceedings|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was lost on 9 September 1980 during [[1980 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Orchid (Toyang)|Typhoon Orchid]], south of [[Japan]]. All 42 crew members and two of their wives were killed in the sinking. At 91,655 [[gross register ton]]s, she was—and remains—the largest British ship ever to have been lost at sea.&lt;ref name="list"&gt;{{cite web|title=List of websites and links of the enquiries of Derbyshire sinking|url=http://c4tx.org/ctx/job/cdb/cas_list/precis.php?id=19800909_001|website=www.c4tx.org|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Derbyshire'' was launched in late 1975 and entered service in June 1976, as the last ship of the ''Bridge''-class combination carrier, originally named ''Liverpool Bridge''. ''Liverpool Bridge'' and ''English Bridge'' (later ''Worcestershire'', and ''Kowloon Bridge'' respectively) were built by Seabridge for Bibby Line. The ship was laid up for two of its four years of service life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What really happened to the Derbyshire|url=http://www.bsnet.co.uk/derbyshire/|accessdate=17 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917114552/http://www.bsnet.co.uk/derbyshire/|archivedate=17 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, ''Liverpool Bridge'' was renamed ''Derbyshire'', the fourth vessel to carry the name in the company's fleet. On 11 July 1980, on what turned out to be the vessel's final voyage, ''Derbyshire'' left [[Sept-Îles, Quebec]], Canada, her destination being [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], [[Japan]], though she foundered near [[Okinawa]] (Southern Japan). ''Derbyshire'' was carrying a cargo of 157,446 tonnes of iron ore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The final voyage of Derbyshire|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/visit/floor-plan/life-at-sea/derbyshire/final-voyage.aspx|website=www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|publisher=Liverpool museum|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 1980, ''Derbyshire'' [[Heaving to|hove-to]] in [[1980 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Orchid .28Toyang.29|Typhoon Orchid]] some 230 miles from Okinawa, and was overwhelmed by the tropical storm killing all aboard. ''Derbyshire'' never issued a [[Mayday]] distress message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The final voyage of MV Derbyshire|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/exhibitions/derbyshire/final_voyage.aspx|publisher=Liverpool Museums|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel had been following [[weather routing]] advice by "Ocean routes", a commercial [[weather routing]] company (subsequently renamed WRI Weather routing incorporated).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us - Our history|url=http://www.wriwx.com/cargo/contactus.php#about|website=www.wriwx.com|publisher=WRI|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marston|first1=Paul|title=Crew cleared over sinking of Derbyshire|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1373769/Crew-cleared-over-sinking-of-Derbyshire.html|accessdate=27 July 2017|publisher=The Telegraph|date=9 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The search for ''Derbyshire'' commenced on 15 September 1980 and was called off six days later when no trace of the vessel was found, and it was declared lost. Six weeks after ''Derbyshire'' sank, one of the vessel's lifeboats was sighted by a Japanese tanker.&lt;ref name="Mearns"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mearns |first=David |title=Searching for the Derbyshire |url=http://www.north-country.co.uk/derbyshire.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010813033209/http://www.north-country.co.uk/Derbyshire.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 August 2001 |accessdate=17 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the loss of her sister ship ''[[MV Kowloon Bridge]]'' off the coast of the Republic of Ireland in 1986, after an unfortunate series of events precipitated by deck cracking discovered after an Atlantic crossing the ''Derbyshire'' investigation was re-opened by the relatives of the victims of the sinking. With financial support from the Seafarers Union in 1994 a deep water search began.

In June 1994, the wreck of ''Derbyshire'' was found at a depth of 4&amp;nbsp;km, spread over 1.3&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conclusions |url=http://www.bsnet.co.uk/derbyshire/conclusion.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000408225347/http://www.bsnet.co.uk/derbyshire/conclusion.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 April 2000 |accessdate=17 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional expedition spent over 40 days photographing and examining the debris field looking for evidence of what sank the ship. Ultimately it was determined that waves crashing over the front of the ship had sheared off the covers of small ventilation pipes near the bow. Over the next 30+ hours, seawater had entered through the exposed pipes into the forward section of the ship, causing the bow to slowly ride lower and lower in the water. Eventually, the bow was completely exposed to the full force of the rough waves which caused the massive hatch on the first cargo hold to buckle inward allowing hundreds of tons of water to enter in moments. As the ship started to sink, the second, then third hatches also failed, dragging the ship underwater. As the ship sank, the water pressure caused the ship to be twisted and torn apart by implosion.

==Memorials==
[[File:MV Derbyshire memorial 2.jpg|thumb|left|The memorial in Liverpool]]
A bronze plaque was placed on the wreckage as a memorial to those who were lost.&lt;ref name="Mearns" /&gt;

On 21 September 1980, the Bibby Line vessel ''Cambridgeshire'' held a memorial service for the ''Derbyshire'' in the area the vessel was lost.

The 20th anniversary of the vessel's loss was marked by a memorial service in [[Liverpool, England]], which was attended by Deputy Prime Minister [[John Prescott]], himself a former merchant seaman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prescott remembers Derbyshire victims|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/917209.stm|publisher=BBC News | date=9 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a memorial service was held in the vessel's home port of Liverpool on the 30th anniversary of ''Derbyshire'''s loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Gary|title=Memorial service to remember loss of MV Derbyshire|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2010/09/13/memorial-service-to-remember-loss-of-mv-derbyshire-92534-27255388/|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A permanent memorial was dedicated on 15th September 2018 in the garden of the [[Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool]].

The '''National Theater''' ({{lang-de|'''Nationaltheater'''}}) on [[Max-Joseph-Platz]] in [[Munich]], Germany, is a historic opera house, home of the [[Bavarian State Opera]], [[Bavarian State Orchestra]] and the [[Bayerisches Staatsballett|Bavarian State Ballet]]. 

== Building ==

===First theatre – 1818 to 1823===
The first theatre was commissioned in 1810 by King [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian I]] of Bavaria because the nearby [[Cuvilliés Theatre]] had too little space. It was designed by [[Karl von Fischer]], with the 1782 [[Odéon]] in [[Paris]] as architectural precedent.&lt;ref name=focus /&gt; Construction began on 26 October 1811 but was interrupted in 1813 by financing problems.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; In 1817 a fire occurred in the unfinished building.

The new theatre finally opened on 12 October 1818 with a performance of ''Die Weihe'' by [[Ferdinand Fränzl]], but was soon destroyed by another fire on 14 January 1823;&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |date= |title=History of the Bayerische Staatsoper |url=https://www.staatsoper.de/en/staatsoper/history/bayerische-staatsoper.html |work= |location= |access-date=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the stage décor caught fire during a performance of ''Die beyden Füchse'' by [[Étienne Méhul]] and the fire could not be put out because the water supply was frozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=1823 |title=Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, Band 25 |url= |location=Leipzig |publisher=Breitkopf und Härtel |page=79 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Görl |first=Wolfgang  |date=1 April 2016 |title=Auch Bier kann den Brand löschen |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/sz-serie-feuer-flamme-teil-auch-bier-kann-den-brand-loeschen-1.2930404 |work=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] |location=Munich |language=German |access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally the Paris Odéon itself burned down in 1818.

===Second theatre – 1825 to 1943===
Designed by [[Leo von Klenze]], the second theater incorporated [[Neo-Grec]] features in its portico and triangular pediment and an entrance supported by [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns. In 1925 it was modified to create an enlarged stage area with updated equipment. The building was gutted in an air raid on the night of 3 October 1943.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

===Third theatre – 1963 to present===
The third and present theatre (1963) recreates Karl von Fischer's original neo-classical design, though on a slightly larger, 2,100-seat scale.&lt;ref name=focus&gt;{{cite news |last=Schönbauer |first=Sina |date=15 June 2016 |title=Die Bayerische Staatsoper ist die drittgrößte Bühne Europas |url=http://www.focus.de/regional/muenchen/das-nationaltheater-in-muenchen-bayerische-staatsoper-die-drittgroesste-buehne-europas_id_3791523.html |work=[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]] |location= |language=German |access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnificent royal [[box (theatre)|box]] is the center of the interior rondel, decorated with two large [[caryatid]]s. The new stage covers {{convert|2500|m2|sqyd}}, and is thus the world's third largest, after the [[Opéra Bastille]] in Paris and the [[Grand Theatre, Warsaw]].&lt;ref name=focus /&gt;

Through the consistent use of wood as a building material, the auditorium has excellent acoustics. Architect [[Gerhard Moritz Graubner]] closely preserved the original look of the foyer and main staircase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Abendroth |first=Walter |date=23 February 1956 |title=Wie soll das neue Nationaltheater aussehen? |url=http://www.zeit.de/1956/08/wie-soll-das-neue-nationaltheater-aussehen |work=[[Die Zeit]] |location=Hamburg |language=German |access-date=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on 21 November 1963 with an invitation-only performance of ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' under the baton of [[Joseph Keilberth]].&lt;ref name=zeit&gt;{{cite news |last=Abendroth |first=Walter |date=29 November 1963 |title=272 Scheinwerfer im Nationaltheater |url=http://www.zeit.de/1963/48/272-scheinwerfer-im-nationaltheater |work=[[Die Zeit]] |location=Hamburg |language=German |access-date=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two nights later came the first public performance, of ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'', again under Keilberth.&lt;ref name=zeit /&gt;

== Music ==
During its early years, the National Theatre saw the premières of a significant number of operas, including many by German composers.  These included Wagner’s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' (1865), ''Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg'' (1868), ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' (1869) and ''[[Die Walküre]]'' (1870), after which Wagner chose to build the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Festspielhaus]] in [[Bayreuth]] and held further premières of his works there.

During the latter part of the 19th century, it was [[Richard Strauss]] who would make his mark on the theatre in the city in which he was born in 1864.  After accepting the position of conductor for a short time, Strauss returned to the theatre to become principal conductor from 1894 to 1898.  In the pre-War period, his ''[[Friedenstag]]'' (1938) and ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]'' were premièred in Munich. In the post-War period, the house has seen significant productions and many world premieres.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24752">Little is known about the exact origin of the music now known as the [[blues]].&lt;ref name="Southern, pg. 332"&gt;Southern, pg. 332&lt;/ref&gt;  No specific year can be cited as the origin of the blues, largely because the style evolved over a long period and existed in approaching its modern form before the term ''blues'' was introduced and before the style was thoroughly documented. [[Ethnomusicologist]] Gerhard Kubik traces the roots of many of the elements that were to develop into the blues back to the [[African music|African]] continent, the "cradle of the blues".&lt;ref&gt;Kubik, Gerhard (1999). ''Africa and the Blues''. Jackson, MI: University Press of Mississippi. {{ISBN|1-57806-146-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; One important early mention of something closely resembling the blues comes from 1901, when an [[archaeologist]] in [[Mississippi]] described the songs of [[African-American|black]] workers which had lyrical themes and technical elements in common with the blues.&lt;ref name="Southern, pg. 334"&gt;Southern, pg. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

==African roots==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[W. C. Handy]] --&gt;
There are few characteristics common to all blues, as the genre takes its shape from the peculiarities of each individual performance.&lt;ref name="Mule"/&gt; Some characteristics, however, were present prior to the creation of the modern blues, and are common to most styles of [[African American music]]. The earliest blues-like music was a "functional expression, rendered in a [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] style without accompaniment or harmony and unbounded by the formality of any particular musical structure".&lt;ref&gt;Garofalo, pg. 44&lt;/ref&gt; This pre-blues music was adapted from the field shouts and hollers performed during slave times, expanded into "simple solo songs laden with emotional content".&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, pg. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gambia kora havard.jpg|thumb|250px|Master Kora maker Alieu Suso in the [[Gambia]]]]
Many of these blues elements, such as the call-and-response format, can be traced back to the [[music of Africa]]. The use of [[melisma]] and a wavy, nasal intonation also suggests a connection between the music of West and Central Africa and the blues.  The belief that blues is historically derived from the [[West African music]] including from [[Mali]] is reflected in [[Martin Scorsese]]’s often quoted characterization of [[Ali Farka Touré]]’s tradition as constituting "the DNA of the blues".&lt;ref&gt;Global South: ''[http://sephisemagazine.org/contemporary-south/our-homage-to-a-great-master-ali-farka-toure.html Our Homage To A Great Master - Ali Farka Toure]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most compelling African instrument that is a predecessor to an African-American instrument is the "[[Akonting]]", a folk lute of the [[Jola people|Jola]] tribe of [[Senegambia (geography)|Senegambia]]. It is a clear predecessor to the American [[banjo]] in its playing style, the construction of the instrument itself and in its social role as a folk instrument. The [[Kora (instrument)|Kora]] is played by a professional caste of praise singers for the rich and aristocracy (called [[griot]]s or jalis) and is not considered folk music. [[Jola people|Jola]] music may not have been influenced much by [[Music of North Africa|North African]]/[[Middle Eastern music]], which may point to African American music not being, according to [[Sam Charters]], related to kora music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} The music of the Akonting and that played by on the banjo by elder African-American banjo players, even into the mid 20th century is easily identified as being very similar. The akonting is perhaps the most important and concrete link that exists between African and African-American music.

The historian [[Sylviane Diouf]] and [[ethnomusicologist]] [[Gerhard Kubik]] identify [[Islamic music]] as an influence on blues music.&lt;ref name="Curiel"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/08/15/INGMC85SSK1.DTL |title=Muslim Roots of the Blues |work=[[SFGate]] |publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' |accessdate=August 24, 2005 |first=Jonathan |last=Curiel |authorlink=Jonathan Curiel |date=August 15, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905161734/http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2004%2F08%2F15%2FINGMC85SSK1.DTL |archivedate=September 5, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diouf notes a striking resemblance between the [[Adhan|Islamic call to prayer]] (originating from [[Bilal ibn Rabah]], a famous [[Abyssinian people|Abyssinian]] [[Islam in Africa|African Muslim]] in the early 7th century) and 19th-century [[field holler]] music, noting that both have similar lyrics praising God, melody, note changes, "words that seem to quiver and shake" in the vocal chords, dramatic changes in [[musical scale]]s, and nasal [[Intonation (music)|intonation]]. She attributes the origins of field holler music to [[African-American Muslims|African Muslim slaves]] who accounted for an estimated 30% of African slaves in America. According to Kubik, "the vocal style of many blues singers using [[melisma]], wavy intonation, and so forth is a heritage of that large region of [[West Africa]] that had been in contact with the [[Arabic world|Arabic]]-[[Islamic world]] of the [[Maghreb]] since the seventh and eighth centuries." Kubik also notes that stringed instruments (including ancestors of the banjo) were generally favored by Muslim African slaves, while drumming was generally favored by non-Muslim African slaves.&lt;ref name="Curiel"/&gt;

While the findings of Kubik and others clearly attest to the essential Africanness of many essential aspects of blues expression, studies by [[Willie Ruff]] and others have situated the origin of "black" spiritual music inside enslaved peoples' exposure to their masters' [[Hebrides|Hebridean]]-originated gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kelbie, "Gospel Truth - Hebrides Invented Church Spirituals", ''The Independent'' - UK, 9-19-3&lt;/ref&gt;  African-American economist and historian [[Thomas Sowell]] also notes that the southern, black, ex-slave population was acculturated to a considerable degree by and among their Scots-Irish "[[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]]" neighbours.    Additionally, there are theories that the four-beats-per-measure structure of the blues might share its origins with the Native American tradition of [[pow wow]] drumming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanindiannews.org/2009/09/music-exploring-native-american-influence-on-the-blues|title=MUSIC: Exploring Native American influence on the blues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of field hollers==
[[Field holler]] music, also known as Levee Camp Holler music, was an early form of [[African American music]], described in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Curiel"/&gt; Field hollers laid the foundations for the blues, [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]], and eventually [[rhythm and blues]].&lt;ref name=shaw&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Arnold|title=Honkers and Shouters: The Golden Years of Rhythm &amp; Blues|date=1978|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=0-02-061740-2|page=3|edition=First}}&lt;!--|accessdate=19 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Field hollers, cries and hollers of the [[slaves]] and later [[sharecropper]]s working in cotton fields, prison [[chain gangs]], railway gangs ([[Gandy dancer]]s) or turpentine camps were the precursor to the [[call and response]] of African American spirituals and [[Gospel music#Roots and background|gospel music]], to [[jug bands]], [[minstrel shows]], [[stride piano]], and ultimately to the blues, [[rhythm and blues]], [[jazz]] and [[African American music]] in general.&lt;ref name=shaw/&gt; [[Sylviane Diouf]] and [[Gerhard Kubik]] have traced the origins of field hollers to [[African-American Muslims|African Muslim slaves]], who were influenced by the [[Islamic music]]al [[Music of West Africa|tradition of West Africa]] (see ''[[#African roots|African roots]]'' above).&lt;ref name="Curiel"/&gt;

== Influence of spirituals ==

[[File:Religious Camp Meeting (Burbank 1839).jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[watercolor]] painting of a camp meeting circa 1839 (New Bedford Whaling Museum).]]
The most important American antecedent of the blues was the [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]], a form of religious song with its roots in the [[camp meeting]]s of the [[Second Great Awakening|Great Awakening]] of the early 19th century. Spirituals were a passionate song form, that "convey(ed) to listeners the same feeling of rootlessness and misery" as the blues.&lt;ref name="Mule"/&gt;  Spirituals, however, were less specifically concerning the performer, instead about the general loneliness of mankind, and were more figurative than direct in their lyrics.&lt;ref name="Mule"&gt;Southern, pg. 333&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these differences, the two forms are similar enough that they can not be easily separated &amp;mdash; many spirituals would probably have been called ''blues'' had that word been in wide use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 333-334&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social and economic aspects ==

[[File:EMANCI4.jpg|thumb|300px|Emancipation from Freedmen's viewpoint; illustration from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' 1865]]
[[File:Virginia Minstrels, 1843.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Detail from cover of ''The Celebrated Negro Melodies, as Sung by the Virginia Minstrels'', 1843]]
The social and economic reasons for the appearance of the blues are not fully known.&lt;ref&gt;Philip V. Bohlman, "Immigrant, folk, and regional music in the twentieth century", in 'The Cambridge History of American Music', ed. David Nicholls, 1999, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-45429-8}}, pg. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Blues has evolved from an unaccompanied vocal music of poor black laborers into a wide variety of styles and subgenres, with regional variations across the United States. African American [[work song]]s were an important precursor to the modern blues; these included the songs sung by laborers like [[stevedores]] and [[roustabout]]s, and the [[field hollers]] and "[[ring shout|shout]]s" of slaves.&lt;ref name="Southern, pg. 334"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/MusicAtlas/Volume2/playpagevol2ch10.html&lt;/ref&gt; The first appearance of the blues is not well defined and is often dated between 1870 and 1900, a period that coincides with the [[Abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] of the slaves and the transition from slavery to sharecropping and small-scale agricultural production in the southern United States.

Several scholars characterize the early 1900s development of blues music as a move from group performances to a more individualized style. They argue that the development of the blues is associated with the newly acquired freedom of the slaves. According to [[Lawrence W. Levine|Lawrence Levine]],&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence W. Levine, ''Black Culture and Black Consciousness: Afro-American Folk Thought from Slavery to Freedom'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1977, {{ISBN|0-19-502374-9}}, pg. 223&lt;/ref&gt; "there was a direct relationship between the national [[Individualism|ideological emphasis upon the individual]], the popularity of [[Booker T. Washington]]'s teachings, and the rise of the blues." Levine states that "psychologically, socially, and economically, Negroes were being acculturated in a way that would have been impossible during slavery, and it is hardly surprising that their secular music reflected this as much as their religious music did."

An important reason for the lack of certain knowledge about the origins of the blues is the earliest blues musicians' tendency to wander through communities, leaving little or no record of precisely what sort of music they played or where it came from. Blues was generally regarded as lower-class music, unfit for documentation, study or enjoyment by the upper- and middle-classes&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 332-333&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blues around 1900==

[[File:Okahumkee-On-The-Ockl.jpg|left|thumb|200px|An 1890s photo of the tourist steamer ''Okahumke'e' on the [[Ocklawaha River]], with black guitarists on board]]
[[Blue note]]s pre-date their use in blues. English composer [[Samuel Coleridge-Taylor]]'s "A Negro Love Song", from his ''The African Suite for Piano'' composed in 1898, contains blue third and seventh notes.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Derek B. ''From the Erotic to the Demonic: On Critical Musicology.'' Oxford University Press (2003) page 182: "A blues idiom is hinted at in "A Negro Love-Song", a pentatonic melody with blue third and seventh in Coleridge-Taylor's ''African Suite'' of 1898, many years before the first blues publications."&lt;/ref&gt;

African American composer [[W. C. Handy]] wrote in his autobiography of the experience of sleeping on a train traveling through (or stopping at the station of) [[Tutwiler, Mississippi]] around 1903, and being awakened by:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... a lean, loose-jointed Negro who had commenced plucking a guitar beside me while I slept. His clothes were rags; his feet peeped out of his shoes. His face had on it some of the sadness of the ages. As he played, he pressed a knife on the strings in a manner popularized by Hawaiian guitarists who used steel bars. ... The effect was unforgettable. His song, too, struck me instantly... The singer repeated the line ("Going' where the Southern cross' the Dog") three times, accompanying himself on the guitar with the weirdest music I had ever heard.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Handy had mixed feelings about this music, which he regarded as rather primitive and monotonous,&lt;ref&gt;Parrish, Tim; ''Walking Blues: Making Americans from Emerson to Elvis'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]] (2001), p. 185: "Handy declares their music to be an endless 'monotony,' a 'thump-thump-thump' sound that he associates&amp;mdash;with evident distaste&amp;mdash;with 'cane rows and levee camps' (77). Nor does he admire the enthusiastic dancing the music elicits."&lt;/ref&gt; but he used the "Southern cross' the Dog" line in his 1914 "[[Yellow Dog Rag]]", which he retitled "Yellow Dog Blues" after the term blues became popular.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elijah Wald|Wald, Elijah]]; ''Escaping the Delta: Robert Johnson and the Invention of the Blues'', Harper Collins (2004), p. 283: "When the popular taste for blues asserted itself I took out that old number and changed its name to 'Yellow Dog Blues.' Other than the name, I altered nothing."&lt;/ref&gt;  "Yellow Dog" was the nickname of the [[Yellow Dog Railroad|Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad]].

Blues later adopted elements from the "Ethiopian (here, meaning "[[black people|black]]") airs" of [[minstrel show]]s and [[Negro spiritual]]s, including instrumental and harmonic accompaniment.&lt;ref&gt;Garofalo, pg. 44 ''Gradually, instrumental and harmonic accompaniment were added, reflecting increasing cross-cultural contact.''  Garofalo goes on to cite others mentioning the "Ethiopian airs" and "Negro spirituals".&lt;/ref&gt; The style also was closely related to [[ragtime]], which developed at about the same time, though the blues better preserved "the original melodic patterns of African music".&lt;ref&gt;Schuller, cited in Garofalo, pg. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1890s, the American [[sheet music]] publishing industry had produced a great deal of [[ragtime]] music. The first published ragtime song to include a 12-bar section was "One o' Them Things!" in 1904. Written by James Chapman and Leroy Smith, it was published in St. Louis, Missouri, by Jos. Plachet and Son.&lt;ref&gt;Saffle, Michael, ''Perspectives on American Music, 1900-1950,'' Routledge (2000) page 74: "Chapman and smith's "One O' Those Things" (1904) an earlier blues/rag mix (see Figure 3.2)."&lt;/ref&gt; Another early rag/blues mix was "[[I Got the Blues]]" published in 1908 by Antonio Maggio of New Orleans
&lt;ref&gt;Saffle, Michael, ''Perspectives on American Music, 1900-1950,'' Routledge (2000) page 74: "In Maggio's "I Got the Blues" (1908), a twelve-bar blues in G Major is followed by a section in G minor, ending with a rag riff (see Figure 3.1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a long interview conducted by [[Alan Lomax]] in 1938, [[Jelly Roll Morton]] recalled that the first blues he had heard, probably around 1900, was played by a singer and prostitute, Mamie Desdunes, in [[Garden District, New Orleans]]. Morton sang the blues: "Can’t give me a dollar, give me a lousy dime/ You can’t give me a dollar, give me a lousy dime/ Just to feed that hungry man of mine". The interview was released as ''[[The Complete Library of Congress Recordings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Marybeth|year=2007|pages=130–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continued development of the blues in the 1910s ==

In 1912 the sheet music industry published another blues composition&amp;mdash;"[[Dallas Blues]]" by [[Hart A. Wand]] of [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;Samuel B. Charters, ''The Country Blues'' (Da Capo Press, 1975), {{ISBN|0-306-80014-4}}, pages 34-35: "The first was Hart Wand's "Dallas Blues", published in March; the second was Arthur Seals's "Bab Seals' Blues", published in August; Handy finally brought out his blues in September. Both Handy and Arthur Seals were Negroes, but the music that they titled "blues is more or less derived from the standard popular musical styles of the "coon-song" and "cake-walk" type. It is ironic the first published piece in the Negro "blues idiom", ''Dallas Blues'', was by a white man, Hart Wand."&lt;/ref&gt; Two other blues-like compositions, precipitating the [[Tin Pan Alley]] adoption of blues elements, were also published in 1912: "Baby Seals' Blues" by [[Baby Franklin Seals]] (arranged by [[Artie Matthews]]) and "[[The Memphis Blues|Memphis Blues]]", another ragtime arrangement with a single 12-bar section,&lt;ref&gt;Saffle, Michael, ''Perspectives on American Music, 1900-1950,'' Routledge (2000) page 74: "White's "Original Chicago Blues" (1915) is a later blues/rag almagam, as is "The Memphis Blues."&lt;/ref&gt; by [[W. C. Handy]].&lt;ref&gt;Garofalo, pg. 27; Garofalo cites Barlow in ''Handy's sudden success demonstrated [the] commercial potential of [the blues], which in turn made the genre attractive to the Tin Pan Alley hacks, who wasted little time in turning out a deluge of imitations''. (parentheticals in Garofalo)&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1912 (on November 9), another song, "The Blues", was copyrighted by LeRoy "Lasses" White, but not actually published until 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Monge, Luigi; David Evans. "New Songs of Blind Lemon Jefferson". ''Journal of Texas Music History'' 3:2 (Fall 2003), p. 19: "In fact, in addition to its textual relationship in the first stanza to 'Michigan Water Blues,' Jefferson's 'Light House Blues' is related textually and musically to an even older song, 'The Negro Blues'/'[[Nigger Blues]]' by Leroy 'Lasses' White of Dallas. White registered his tune with a set of fifteen three-line stanzas for copyright on November 9, 1912, under the former title. In 1913, a shortened version of the piece was published under the latter infelicitous title, containing only six stanzas, five of which are close variants of stanzas in the longer version and one of which is new."&lt;/ref&gt;

Handy was a formally trained musician, composer and arranger who helped to popularize the blues by transcribing and orchestrating blues in an almost symphonic style, with bands and singers. He became a popular and prolific composer, and billed himself as the "Father of the Blues"; however, his compositions can be described as a fusion of blues with ragtime and jazz, a merger facilitated using the [[Afro-Cuban]] [[habanera (music)|habanera]] rhythm that had long been a part of ragtime;&lt;ref&gt;Garofalo, pg. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morales, pg. 277&lt;/ref&gt;  Handy's signature work was the ''[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]''.

Songs from this period had many different structures. A testimony of those times can be found for instance in [[Henry Thomas (blues musician)|Henry Thomas]]'s recordings. However, the [[twelve bar blues|twelve-]], [[eight-bar blues|eight-bar]], or [[sixteen bar blues|sixteen-bar]] structure based on [[tonic chord|tonic]], [[subdominant chord|subdominant]] and [[dominant chord]]s became the most common.&lt;ref&gt;Garofalo, pgs. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; Melodically, blues music is marked by the use of the [[lowered third]] and [[dominant seventh]] (so-called [[blue note]]s) of the associated [[major scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, pg. 143&lt;/ref&gt; The standard 12-bar blues form is noted in uncorroborated [[oral history|oral histories]] as appearing communities throughout the region along the lower [[Mississippi River]] during the decade of the 1900s (and performed in [[New Orleans]] at least since 1908). One of these early sites of blues evolution was along [[Beale Street]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. However, author [[Eileen Southern]] has pointed out several contrasting statements by old-time musicians. She cites [[Eubie Blake]] as saying "Blues in Baltimore? Why, Baltimore is the blues!" and [[Bunk Johnson]] as claiming that the blues was around in his childhood, in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Southern, pg. 332"/&gt;

== Growth of the blues (1920s onward) ==

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Mamie Smith-Complete Works Vol 1.png|right|frame|Mamie Smith on the sleeve of volume 1 of the ''Complete Recorded Works'' reissue collection]] --&gt;
One of the first professional blues singers was [[Ma Rainey]], who claimed to have coined the term ''blues''.  [[classic female blues|Classic female urban]] or [[vaudeville]] blues singers were popular in the 1920s, among them [[Mamie Smith]], Gertrude Ma Rainey, [[Bessie Smith]], and  [[Victoria Spivey]]. Mamie Smith, more a vaudeville performer than a blues artist, was the first African- American to record a blues in 1920; her "Crazy Blues" sold over 75,000 copies in its first month.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkeye Herman, General background on African American Music, Blues Foundation, Essays: What is the blues?{{cite web|url=http://www.blues.org/blues/essays.php4?Id%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210013210/http://www.blues.org/blues/essays.php4?Id=3 |archivedate=December 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical forms and styles that are now considered the "blues" as well as modern "[[country music]]" arose in the same regions during the nineteenth century in the southern United States. Recorded blues and country can be found from as far back as the 1920s, when the popular record industry developed and created marketing categories called "[[race music]]" and "[[hillbilly music]]" to sell music by blacks for blacks and by whites for whites respectively. At the time, there was no clear musical division between "blues" and "country", except for the race of the performer, and even that sometimes was documented incorrectly by record companies.&lt;ref&gt;Garofalo, pgs. 44-47 ''As marketing categories, designations like race and [[hillbilly]] intentionally separated artists along racial lines and conveyed the impression that their music came from mutually exclusive sources. Nothing could have been further from the truth... In cultural terms, blues and country were more equal than they were separate.'' Garofalo claims that ''artists were sometimes listed in the wrong racial category in record company catalogues.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in [[Tuscany]], the '''Piccola Accademia di Montisi''' is a meeting place for musicians who have an interest in the [[harpsichord]].

== Background ==
In recent years, popular access to original instruments has diminished, with many institutions regarding their collections as historical artefacts to be seen and not heard. The Piccola Accademia is addressing this problem by creating a collection of antique and replica harpsichords. This approach aims to guarantee the veracity of the original musical compositions for future generations by ensuring that they are performed upon historically authentic instruments. The ultimate aim is to promote the harpsichord as a vibrant, living medium.

== Mission statement ==
The Piccola Accademia describes itself as "committed to providing access to exceptional instruments, teaching and recording facilities to the musical community, as well more broadly raising the profile of quality historic performance and appreciation of the harpsichord through regular performances, festivals, community events and communications".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piccolaaccademia.org/content/ Piccola Accademia website]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617101458/http://www.piccolaaccademia.org/content/ |date=June 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
The Piccola Accademia plays an active role in promoting the harpsichord to modern performers and audiences. This is achieved through the annual Montisi festival and also by educative master classes given by experts. Regular concerts are held in the stunning churches and monasteries within [[San Giovanni d'Asso|Montisi]] and the surrounding area. Held in [[Montisi]], the Accademia's annual festival presents instrumental and vocal ensembles which showcase composers informed by the harpsichord. Artists range from rising stars of the genre to distinguished exponents of historic performance such as [[Alan Curtis (harpsichordist)|Alan Curtis]], noted American [[harpsichordist]], [[musicologist]], and conductor of [[baroque opera]]. The 2007 Montisi festival marked the 250th anniversary of [[Domenico Scarlatti]]’s death with performances by [[Gustav Leonhardt]], [[Mahan Esfahani]], [[Capriccio Stravagante]] and others. The Piccola Accademia plans to visit London in November 2008, participating in the [[London Bach Society]]’s ‘Bachfest’ programme. Performers will include [[Laurence Cummings]] and [[Warwick Thompson]]. The 2008 Montisi festival featured performances by [[Bob van Asperen]], Francesco Cera and ensemble, [[Mahan Esfahani]], and [[Pieter Wispelwey]], while the 2009 festival featured performances by [[Pierre Hantai]], [[Gustav Leonhardt]], and [[Mahan Esfahani]].

'''Portland Film Festival''' is a non-profit independent film festival that is held in several local theaters in [[Portland, Oregon]]. It was founded in 2013 by Joshua Leake and Jay Cornelius. The first film festival was held from August 27 through September 1, 2013 and featured networking events, workshops, a [[beer garden]], and food carts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='For The Love Of Film': Portland's Newest Cinema Festival Debuts|url=http://www.opb.org/artsandlife/article/for-love-of-film-portlands-newest-cinema-festival-debuts/|publisher=OPB|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 83 films were shown in the inaugural festival and over 600 were submitted for consideration at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Festival Spotlight Friday: Portland Film Festival is the Artist Colony of Your Dreams|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/festivals/festival-spotlight-friday-portland-film-festival-is-the-artist-colony-of-your-dreams/|publisher=MovieMaker|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highlights of the event included [[Andy Mingo]]'s short film ''Romance'', which was based on a [[Chuck Palahniuk]] short story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Palahniuk helps readers (and now filmgoers) find 'Romance'|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/index.ssf/2013/08/palahniuk_helps_readers_and_no.html|publisher=Oregon Live|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dispatches from the Portland Film Festival: Chuck Palahniuk Hands Out Stuffed Kittens|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-30618-dispatches_from_the_portland_film_festival_chuck_p.html|publisher=WWeek|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rape by gender''' classifies types of [[rape]] by the [[sex or gender]] of both the rapist and the victim. This scope includes both rape and [[sexual assault]] more generally. Most research indicates that rape affects women disproportionately, with the majority of people convicted being men; however, since the broadening of the definition of rape in 2012 by the [[FBI]], more attention is being given to [[male rape]], including females raping males.

Since only a small percentage of acts of [[sexual violence]] are brought to the attention of the authorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=26309&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=675|title=The Secretary Generals database on violence against women |publisher=UN Secretary General's Database on Violence Against Women|date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2013-02-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201182537/http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=26309&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=675|archivedate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rds.homeoffice.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110314171826/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-03-14 |title=A gap or a chasm? Attrition in reported rape cases |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to compile accurate [[rape statistics]]. Conviction rates differ by the gender of both the perpetrator and victim. Various studies argue that male-male and female-female [[prison rape]] are quite common and may be the least reported form of rape.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]][https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2001/prison/report7.html#_1_48 No Escape: Male Rape In U.S. Prisons.

More men (54%) than women (28%) reported an incident that was classified as rape."&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a large number of rape cases take place when the victims are below the [[age of consent]], bringing in the issue of [[child sexual abuse]] or [[statutory rape]].

== Rape of females ==
{{violence against women}}
In a 2000 research article from the [[Home Office]], in England and Wales, around 1 in 20 women (5%) said that they had been raped at some point in their life from the age of 16 beyond.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135832/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r159.pdf Rape and sexual assault of women: findings from the British Crime Survey]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the US  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that "nearly 20% of all women" in the [[United States]] suffered attempted rape or rape sometime in their life. More than a third of the victims were raped before the age of 18.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite news|title=Nearly 20% of women in the US are raped or suffer attempted rape at some point in their lives, a US study says.|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16192494|accessdate=15 December 2011|newspaper=BBC World|date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NISVS2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf | title=National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey 2010 Summary Report | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 report by the CDC, 28% of victimized heterosexual women and a full 48% of bisexual women experienced their first rape between the ages of 11 and 17.&lt;ref name=lgbt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/25/us-usa-gays-violence-idUSBRE90O11W20130125|first=Susan|last=Heavey|title=Data shows domestic violence, rape an issue for gays|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=October 31, 2013|date=January 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rape of females by males===

Many rapes by males against females are unreported because of "fear of reprisal from the assailant"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimevictimservices.org/page/sexassault/76 |title=(CVS) |publisher=Crime Victim Services |accessdate=2013-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615195527/http://www.crimevictimservices.org/page/sexassault/76 |archivedate=2013-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and because of "shame...and deep-seated cultural notions that the woman is somehow to blame".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kued/nosafeplace/studyg/rape.html |title=Rape and Sexual Assault |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from the University of Surrey estimate that approximately 1 in 7 rapes by males against females are reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surrey.ac.uk/mediacentre/press/2009/16532_between_7090_rapes_thought_to_go_unreported_and_94_of_reported_cases_dont_end_in_a_conviction.htm |title=Between 70-90% rapes thought to go unreported …and 94% of reported cases don’t end in a conviction - University of Surrey - Guildford |publisher=Surrey.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pregnancy [[Pregnancy from rape|may result from rape]]. The rate varies between settings and depends particularly on the extent to which [[non-barrier contraceptives]] are being used. A study of adolescents in [[Ethiopia]] found that among those who reported being raped, 17% became pregnant after the rape,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Prevalence and outcomes of sexual violence among high school students|pmid=10214457|year= 1998|last1= Mulugeta|first1= E|last2= Kassaye|first2= M|last3= Berhane|first3= Y|volume= 36|issue= 3|pages= 167–74|journal= Ethiopian medical journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; a figure which is similar to the 15–18% reported by rape crisis centres in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Evaluacio´n de proyecto para educacio´n, capacitacio´n y atencio´n a mujeres y menores de edad en materia de violencia sexual, enero a diciembre 1990.

Assault by forcible stimulation of female genitalia by a female perpetrator is possible by [[Fingering (sexual act)|digital manipulation]], [[oral sex]], [[Strap-on dildo|strap-ons]], other [[dildos]] or other foreign objects, or [[tribadism]].&lt;ref&gt;Renzetti, Claire M.

In the same survey, approximately 1 in 8 lesbians (13.1%) reported having been raped in their lifetime, but the sex of their rapists was not reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVS_FactSheet_LBG-a.pdf|title=National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey: 2010 Findings on Victimization by Sexual Orientation|work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 survey by the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault (CALCASA) concluded that one in three lesbian-identified participants had been sexually assaulted by a woman.  Fear of coming out, distrust of and/or indifference and hostility by the police, unwillingness to turn in  members of the LGBT community, and a sense that female on female rape is not taken as seriously as rape by men causes some victims to be reluctant to report rapes by other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a19495/women-raped-by-women/|title=When Your Rapist Is a Woman|author=|date=30 March 2016|website=marieclaire.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one publicized case involving students at [[Smith College]] in 2005, two women were charged with  the rape of another, but the victim ultimately refused to testify, and charges were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/20050120/News/301209949|title=Two women arraigned on rape charges|first=THE ASSOCIATED|last=PRESS|date=|website=southcoasttoday.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycollegian.com/2005/09/07/rape-charges-dropped-against-local-women/|title=Rape charges dropped against local women|first=Matt Belliveau, Collegian|last=Staff|date=|website=dailycollegian.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Rape of males}}

A CDC study found that, in the US, 1 in 71 men had been raped or suffered an attempt within their lifetime. The same study found that approximately 1 in 21 or 4.8% men in a survey had been made to penetrate someone else, usually an intimate partner or acquaintance.&lt;ref&gt;Black, M.C., Basile, K.C., Breiding, M.J., Smith, S.G., Walters, M.L., Merrick, M.T., Chen, J., &amp; Stevens, M.R.

Using these statistics it was estimated that, in the US, 92,748 men had been raped in the previous year.{{when|date=April 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;P., Tjaden, &amp; N., Thoennes (2000). [https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/183781.pdf Full Report of the Prevalence, Incidence, and Consequence of Violence Against Women.] US Department of Justice, pp. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In another study by the School of Public Health at Boston University,  30 percent of gay and bisexual men reported having experienced at least one form of sexual assault during their lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/today/2011/lesbians-gays-bisexuals-at-increased-risk-for-sexual-assault/|title=Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals at Increased Risk for Sexual Assault - BU Today - Boston University|author=|date=|website=bu.edu|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rape of men has often been documented as a weapon of war.&lt;ref name="Storr"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/17/the-rape-of-men|title=The rape of men : Society : The Observer|last=Storr|first=Will|date=17 July 2011|work=[[The Observer]]|publisher=Guardian.co.uk|accessdate=17 July 2011|quote=Sexual violence is one of the most horrific weapons of war, an instrument of terror used against women. Yet huge numbers of men are also victims.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male sexual assault is also prevalent on US college campuses. On US campuses, 1 in 16 men are survivors of sexual assault.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Although the rate of male sexual assault is relatively high, many do not file reports due to the misconception of sexual assault being a women’s issue due to “preconceived notions about both sexual violence and gender."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jmm.sagepub.com/content/12/3/275.full.pdf+html|title=Sign In|website=jmm.sagepub.com|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some cases when men will speak up about being a survivor, such as in the documentary ''[[The Hunting Ground]],'' which is about the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses in the US and the failure of college administration to adequately deal with it.

===Rape of males by males===
Rape by males against males has been heavily [[Social stigma|stigmatized]]. According to psychologist Dr. Sarah Crome, fewer than 1 in 10 male-male rapes are reported. As a group, male rape victims reported a lack of services and support, and legal systems are often ill-equipped to deal with this type of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Male rape victims left to suffer in silence|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/stories/s244535.htm|date=February 9, 2001|accessdate=2007-05-30|publisher=abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies argue that male-male [[Prison rape|prisoner rape]], as well as female-female prisoner rape, are common types of rape which go unreported even more frequently than rape in the general population.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]] [https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2001/prison/report7.html#_1_48 No Escape: Male Rape In U.S. Prisons.

Sometimes referred to as "made to penetrate" cases (by the CDC and the NISVS), male rape victims are forced to engage in penetration of the female without proper consent. In many cases, the male victims are [[drug facilitated sexual assault|under the influence of drugs]] or being held in life-threatening positions. The case of Cierra Ross'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/06/cierra-ross-charged-raping-man_n_3882608.html Cierra Ross, Chicago Mom, Charged With Raping Man At Gunpoint], Huffington Post, September 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; sexual assault of a man in Chicago gained national headlines and Ross was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual abuse and armed robbery with a bail set at $75,000. A similar case includes James Landrith, who was made to penetrate a female acquaintance in a hotel room while incapacitated from drinking, along with his rapist citing the fact that she was pregnant to advise him not to struggle, as this might hurt the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/09/living/chris-brown-female-on-male-rape/ |title=Against his will: The reality of male rape |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=2014-01-11 |date=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Landrith|first1=James A.|title=I've Got the T-Shirt and the Trauma Response to Go With It|url=https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/ive-got-the-t-shirt-and-the-trauma-response-to-go-with-it/|website=The Good Men Project|date=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the 1970s [[Mormon sex in chains case]] brought increased awareness of the possibility of female-on-male rape. A young [[Mormon missionary]] named Kirk Anderson went missing in 1977, in [[Ewell]], [[Surrey]], after being abducted from the steps of a church [[meetinghouse]].&lt;ref name=ECBC&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture |first= Fatima |last= Fernandes |article= Sex scandals |editor= Peter Childs and Mike Storry |year= 1999 |publisher= [[Taylor &amp; Francis|Taylor &amp;amp; Francis]] |isbn= 978-0-415-14726-2 |pp=489}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, Anderson made a report to the police that he had been abducted and imprisoned against his will. He said that while chained to a bed, Joyce Bernann McKinney attempted to seduce him, and then raped him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_10152074 |title= Cloned-dog owner is '70s fugitive |first= Jennifer |last= Dobner |newspaper= [[The Denver Post]] |agency= ([[Associated Press|AP]]) |date= 2008-08-10 |accessdate= 2014-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bone2008&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article4481742.ece |title= Missing years in Bernann McKinney's strange journey from Mormon sex case to clones called Booger |newspaper= [[The Sunday Times]] |date= 2008-08-08 |last1= Bone |first1= James |first2= Dominic |last2= Kennedy |accessdate= 2009-02-22 |place= London }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StPetersburgTimes1&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= [[St. Petersburg Times]] |date= 2008-08-13 |page= A1 |title= Corrections }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SacramentoBee1&gt;{{cite news |title= Setting it straight|date=2008-08-13 |page= A2 |newspaper= [[The Sacramento Bee]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/i-dress-my-dog-in-a-pumpkin-costume---is-that-a-gateway-to-madness/article1349792/ |title= I dress my dog in a pumpkin costume - is that a gateway to madness? |newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] |first= Rebecca |last= Dube |date= August 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; News coverage was extensive, in part because the case was considered so anomalous, having involved the rape of a man by a woman.&lt;ref name=Delano1978&gt;{{cite book |last= Delano |first= Anthony |year= 1978 |title= Joyce McKinney and the Manacled Mormon |place= London |publisher= Mirror Books |isbn= 085939140X |oclc= 4525404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McKinney fled to the US, extradition was not pursued by Britain, and the English court sentenced McKinney ''in absentia'' to a year in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/columnists/2008/01/29/a-mormon-a-beauty-queen-and-manacles-91466-20404168/|title=A Mormon, a beauty queen and manacles...|work=[[South Wales Echo]]|date=2008-01-29|last=O'Neill|first=Dan|accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the then-[[Sexual Offences Act 1956]], due to the victim's gender, technically no crime of rape was committed, though indecent assault of a man applied.&lt;ref name=OPSI1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1956/cukpga_19560069_en_2|title=Sexual Offences Act 1956 (c.69), section Intercourse by force, intimidation, etc|publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]]|accessdate=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several widely publicized cases of female-on-male [[statutory rape]] in the United States involved school teachers engaging in sexual intercourse with their underage students. Each of the 50 states has laws regarding the [[age of consent]], but all have it set at 16, 17 or 18. These laws make any sexual encounters between adults and minors under the age of consent sexual assault (see [[Mary Kay Letourneau]] and [[Debra Lafave]]).

'''''Reeves v CH Robinson Worldwide, Inc''''',  5 No. 07-10270 (11th Cir. January 20, 2010) is a [[US labor law]] case under [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act]] of 1964 heard  before the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] which ruled  that a [[hostile work environment]] can be created in a workplace where [[sexually explicit language]]  and [[pornography]] are present.  A  [[hostile workplace]] may exist even if it is not targeted at any  particular employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dozierlawgroup.com/blog/|title=Dozier Law Group Blog|website=www.dozierlawgroup.com|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
Ms. Reeves was the only woman working in her area as a transportation [[sales representative]] in the [[Birmingham, Ala.]], office of [[C.H. Robinson]], an [[Eden Prairie, Minnesota]]-based transportation services firm. In her [[lawsuit]] she claimed that "sexually offensive language permeated the work environment" from both her co-workers and her supervisor. Sexually explicit radio programming played on a daily basis and when she complained about it she was told it was up to her to play her own radio stations. When she did change the channel others would change it back. She resigned in 2004 and filed a complaint in 2006, claiming that the sexually offensive language created a hostile work environment. 

A lower court dismissed her case granting summary judgment to her employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.findlaw.com/eleventh_circuit/2010/01/reeves-v-ch-robinson-worldwide-inc-no-07-10270.html|title=Reeves v.

'''Remembrance Day''' (sometimes known informally as '''Poppy Day''' owing to the tradition of the [[remembrance poppy]]) is a memorial day observed in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] member states since the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] to remember the members of their [[Military|armed forces]] who have died in the line of duty. Following a tradition inaugurated by King [[George V]] in 1919,&lt;ref name=lRSA&gt;{{cite web | publisher=rsa.org.nz | title=The Remembrance Ceremony | url=http://www.rsa.org.nz/remem/rsa_hist_ceremony.html |accessdate=11 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604230050/http://www.rsa.org.nz/remem/rsa_hist_ceremony.html|archivedate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the day is also marked by war remembrances in many non-Commonwealth countries. Remembrance Day is observed on 11 November in most countries to recall the end of hostilities of [[World War I]] on that date in 1918. Hostilities formally ended "at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month", in accordance with [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|the armistice]] signed by representatives of Germany and the Entente between 5:12 and 5:20 that morning. ("At the 11th hour" refers to the ''passing'' of the 11th hour, or 11:00&amp;nbsp;am.) The First World War officially ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] on 28 June 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=World War I Ended With the Treaty of Versailles | url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/jazz/jb_jazz_ww1_1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of Remembrance Day evolved out of  [[Armistice Day]]. The initial Armistice Day was observed at [[Buckingham Palace]], commencing with King George V hosting a "Banquet in Honour of the President of the [[French Republic]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|1000799|Banquet in honour of The President of the French Republic, Monday 10 November 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the evening hours of 10 November 1919. The first official Armistice Day was subsequently held on the grounds of Buckingham Palace the following morning. During World War II, many countries changed the name of the holiday. Member states of the Commonwealth of Nations adopted Remembrance Day, while the US chose [[Veterans Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/armistice-day-remembrance-day-and-veterans-day-whats-the-difference-a6730081.html|title=Armistice Day, Remembrance Day and Veterans Day - what's the difference?|first=Samuel|last=Osborne|date=11 November 2015|access-date=18 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118032603/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/armistice-day-remembrance-day-and-veterans-day-whats-the-difference-a6730081.html|archive-date=18 November 2018|newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observance in the Commonwealth==
[[File:Inflandersfieldslestweforget01.JPG|thumb| Canadian [[Papaver rhoeas|Poppy]] pins adorn a memorial at [[McCrae House]] in [[Guelph]], [[Ontario]]]]
The common British, Canadian, South African, and [[Anzac Day|ANZAC]] tradition includes a one- or [[two-minute silence]] at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month (11:00&amp;nbsp;am, 11 November), as that marks the time (in the United Kingdom) when the armistice became effective.

The Service of Remembrance in many Commonwealth countries generally includes the sounding of the "[[Last Post]]", followed by the period of silence, followed by the sounding of "[[Reveille]]" or sometimes just "[[The Rouse]]" (often confused for each other), and finished by a recitation of the "[[Ode of Remembrance]]". The "[[Flowers of the Forest]]", "[[O Valiant Hearts]]", "[[I Vow to Thee, My Country]]" and "[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]" are often played during the service. Services also include wreaths laid to honour the fallen, a blessing, and national anthems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/feature/vetweek/comm_guide |title=A Guide to Commemorative Services – Veterans Affairs Canada |publisher=Veterans Affairs Canada |date=1 October 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central ritual at [[cenotaph]]s throughout the Commonwealth is a stylised night vigil. [[The Last Post]] was the common bugle call at the close of the military day, and [[The Rouse]] was the first call of the morning. For military purposes, the traditional night vigil over the slain was not just to ensure they were indeed dead and not unconscious or in a coma, but also to guard them from being mutilated or despoiled by the enemy, or dragged off by scavengers. This makes the ritual more than just an act of remembrance but also a pledge to guard the honour of war dead. The act is enhanced by the use of dedicated cenotaphs (literally Greek for "empty tomb") and the laying of wreaths—the traditional means of signalling high honours in ancient Greece and Rome.

===Australia===
[[File:11 Nov gnangarra-9.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Governor of Western Australia]], [[Malcolm McCusker]], laying a wreath at the Eternal flame, [[Kings Park, Western Australia]], 11 November 2011]]
In Australia, Remembrance Day is always observed on 11 November, regardless of the day of the week, and is not a public holiday; it is a time when people can pay their respects to the substantial number of soldiers who died in battle. Some institutions observe two-minutes' silence at 11&amp;nbsp;am through a programme named Read 2 Remember,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.read2remember.org.au/ |title=Read 2 Remember |accessdate=11 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113165704/http://www.read2remember.org.au/ |archivedate=13 November 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; children read the ''Pledge of Remembrance'' by Rupert McCall and teachers deliver specially developed resources to help children understand the significance of the day and the resilience of those who have fought for their country and call on children to also be resilient when facing difficult times. Services are held at 11&amp;nbsp;am at [[war memorial]]s and schools in suburbs and cities across the country, at which the "Last Post" is sounded by a bugler and a one-minute silence is observed. In recent decades, Remembrance Day has been largely eclipsed as the national day of war commemoration by [[ANZAC Day]] (25 April), which is a public holiday in all states.

When Remembrance Day falls on a normal working day in Melbourne and other major cities, buglers from the [[Australian Defence Force]] often play the "Last Post" at major street corners in the CBD. While this occurs, the majority of passers-by stop and observe a moment of silence while waiting for the bugler to finish the recital.

===Barbados===
In [[Barbados]], Remembrance Day is not a [[Public holidays in Barbados|public holiday]]. It is recognised as 11 November, but the parade and ceremonial events are carried out on Remembrance Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Remembrance Day Parade |author=Staff writer |first= |last= |authorlink= |url=http://www.cbc.bb/index.pl/article?id=5297144 |agency=[[Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation]] |newspaper= |publisher=CBC |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id=5297144 |date=9 November 2009 |page= |pages= |accessdate=10 November 2009 |trans-title=|quote= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230714/http://www.cbc.bb/index.pl/article?id=5297144 |archivedate=3 March 2016 |ref= |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The day is celebrated to recognise the Barbadian soldiers who died fighting in the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World Wars]]. The parade is held at [[National Heroes Square|National Heroes' Square]], where an interdenominational service is held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Donna |last=Sealy |title=Salute to war dead |url=http://www.nationnews.com/news/local/remembrance-day-FRONT-PAGE-OTHER |newspaper=[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)|Nation Newspaper]] |date=9 November 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2009 |quote= }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Governor-General of Barbados|Governor-General]] and Barbadian [[Prime Minister of Barbados|Prime Minister]] are among those who attend, along with other government dignitaries and the heads of the [[Royal Barbados Police Force|police]] and [[Barbados Defence Force|military]] forces. During the main ceremony a [[Gun salute#Heavy arms: gun salutes|gun salute]], wreaths, and prayers are also performed at the war memorial Cenotaph at the heart of Heroes' Square in [[Bridgetown]].

===Belize===
In [[Belize]], Remembrance Day is observed on 11 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trujillo|first1=Renee|title=Remembrance Day Observed in Belize|url=http://lovefm.com/2015/11/11/remembrance-day-observed-in-belize/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114014940/http://lovefm.com/2015/11/11/remembrance-day-observed-in-belize/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 November 2015|accessdate=12 November 2015|work=LoveFM|date=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a [[public holidays in Belize|public holiday]].

===Bermuda===
[[File:Rembrance Day Parade Bermuda.jpg|thumb|Remembrance Day Parade, Hamilton, Bermuda, 1991]]
In [[Bermuda]], which sent the first colonial volunteer unit to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1915, and which had more people per capita in uniform during the [[Second World War]] than any other part of the Empire, Remembrance Day is still an important holiday. The parade in Hamilton had historically been a large and colourful one, as contingents from the Royal Navy, British Regular Army and Territorial Army units of the [[Bermuda Garrison]], the Canadian Forces, the US Army, Air Force, and Navy, and various cadet corps and other services all at one time or another marched with the veterans. Since the closing of British, Canadian, and American bases in 1995, the parade has barely grown smaller. In addition to the ceremony held in the City of [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]] on Remembrance Day itself, marching to the Cenotaph (a smaller replica of the one in London), where wreaths are laid and orations made, the Royal Navy and the [[Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps]] held a parade the same day at the {{HMS|Jervis Bay}} memorial in Hamilton, and a smaller military parade is also held in [[St. George, Bermuda|St. George's]] on the nearest Sunday to Remembrance Day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bermuda-online.org/warveterans.htm "Bermuda Online honors Bermuda's war veterans"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, Remembrance Day is a [[Public holidays in Canada|statutory holiday]] in all three territories and in six of the ten provinces ([[Nova Scotia]], [[Manitoba]], [[Ontario]], and [[Quebec]] being the exceptions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/lae/employmentrights/remembrance.asp| last=Ministry of Labour and Advanced Education| title=Remembrance Day Holiday in Nova Scotia| publisher=Queen's Printer for Nova Scotia| accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.statutoryholidays.com/ontario.php| title=Statutory holidays in Ontario| publisher=Statutory Holidays Canada| accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/labour/standards/doc,remembrance-day,factsheet.html| last=Office of Employment Standards| title=Remembrance Day in Manitoba| publisher=Queen's Printer for Manitoba| accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.statutoryholidays.com/index.php| title=Public Holidays in Canada| publisher=Statutory Holidays Canada| accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1921 to 1930, the Armistice Day Act provided that Thanksgiving would be observed on [[Armistice Day]], which was fixed by statute on the Monday of the week in which 11 November fell. In 1931, [[Parliament of Canada|the federal parliament]] adopted an act to amend the ''Armistice Day Act'', providing that the day should be observed on 11 November and that the day should be known as ''Remembrance Day''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/jfa-ha/action-eng.cfm| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=Thanksgiving and Remembrance Day| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bill (C-597) intended to make Remembrance Day a federal statutory holiday was tabled in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] during the [[41st Canadian Parliament|41st parliament]], but died on the order paper when parliament was dissolved for a federal election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/remembrance-day-a-statutory-holiday-attempt-to-make-it-so-clears-hurdle-1.2090497| title=Remembrance Day a statutory holiday?

The federal department of [[Veterans Affairs Canada]] states that the date is of "remembrance for the men and women who have served, and continue to serve our country during times of war, conflict and peace"; particularly the First and Second World Wars, the [[Korean War]], and all conflicts since then in which members of the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] have participated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/history/a-day-of-remembrance/r_intro| last=Veterans Affairs Canada| authorlink=Veterans Affairs Canada| title=Remembrance – History – A Day of Remembrance – Introduction| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada|date=23 October 2014|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department runs a program called ''Canada Remembers'' with the mission of helping young and new Canadians, most of whom have never known war, "come to understand and appreciate what those who have served Canada in times of war, armed conflict and peace stand for and what they have sacrificed for their country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/canrem| last=Veterans Affairs Canada| authorlink=Veterans Affairs Canada| title=Canada Remembers &gt; About Canada Remembers| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=11 November 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119065820/http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/canrem| archivedate=19 January 2012| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official national ceremonies are held at the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|National War Memorial]] in Ottawa. These are presided over by the [[Governor General of Canada]] and attended by the [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], other dignitaries, the [[Silver Cross Mother]], and public observers. Occasionally, a member of the [[Monarchy of Canada#Royal family and house|Canadian Royal Family]] may also be present (such as [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/eng/1294862464851/1294862464853 | title=Government of Canada Announces the Itinerary for the 2009 Visit of The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall |date= 30 October 2009 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/11/11/canada_remembers_national_war_memorial_rededicated.html| author=The Canadian Press| title=Canada remembers: Governor General rededicates National War Memorial| date=11 November 2014| newspaper=Toronto Star| accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Before the start of the event, four sentries and three sentinels (two flag sentinels and one nursing sister) are posted at the foot of the cenotaph. The commemoration then typically begin with the tolling of the [[carillon]] in the [[Peace Tower]], during which current members of the armed forces arrive at [[Confederation Park|Confederation Square]], followed by the Ottawa [[diplomatic corps]], [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]], special guests, the [[Royal Canadian Legion]] (RCL), the royal party (if present), and the [[Viceroy|viceregal]] party. The arrival of the governor general is announced by a trumpeter sounding the "Alert", whereupon the [[viceroy]] is met by the Dominion President of the RCL and escorted to a dais to receive the [[Honors music|Viceregal Salute]], after which the [[national anthem]], "[[O Canada]]", is played.
[[File:Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with poppies.jpg|thumb|left|Poppies are laid on the [[Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] on Remembrance Day in [[Ottawa]]]]

The moment of remembrance begins with the bugling of "[[Last Post]]" immediately before 11:00&amp;nbsp;am, at which time the gun salute fires and the bells of the Peace Tower toll the hour. Another gun salute signals the end of the two minutes of silence, and cues the playing of a [[lament]], the bugling of "[[The Rouse]]", and the reading of the ''[[Act of Remembrance]]''. A [[flypast]] of [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] craft then occurs at the start of a [[21-gun salute]], upon the completion of which a choir sings "[[In Flanders Fields]]". The various parties then lay their wreaths at the base of the memorial; one wreath is set by the Silver Cross Mother (a recent recipient of the [[Memorial Cross]]) on behalf of all mothers whose children died in conflicts in which Canada participated. The viceregal and/or royal group return to the dais to receive the playing of the Canadian Royal Anthem, "[[God Save the Queen]]", prior to the assembled armed forces personnel and veterans performing a [[March (music)|march past]] in front of the viceroy and any royal guest, bringing about the end of the official ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.legion.ca/asp/docs/feature/RemDay_e.asp| title=National Remembrance Day Ceremony 2007| publisher=Royal Canadian Legion| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525114057/http://www.legion.ca/asp/docs/feature/RemDay_e.asp| archivedate=25 May 2008|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tradition of paying more personal tribute has emerged since erection of the [[Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] at the War Memorial in 2000: after the official ceremony the general public place their poppies atop the tomb.

Similar ceremonies take place in provincial capitals across the country, officiated by the relevant [[Lieutenant Governor (Canada)|lieutenant governor]], as well as in other cities, towns, and even hotels or corporate headquarters. Schools will usually hold special assemblies for the first half of the day, or on the school day prior, with various presentations concerning the remembrance of the war dead. The largest indoor ceremony in Canada is usually held in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, with over 9,000 gathering in [[Credit Union Centre]] in 2010;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris |last=Carr |title=Thousands gather for Remembrance Day ceremony in Saskatoon |url=http://www.newstalk980.com/story/20101111/43093 |publisher=StarPhoenix |date=11 November 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ceremony participants include veterans, current members of the Canadian forces, and sea, army, and air cadet units.

In 1994, [[National Aboriginal Veterans Day]] was inaugurated to recognise the contribution of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/indigenous-canadians-remember-ancestors-who-fought-died-in-war/article32725644/|work=Globe &amp; ail|author=Berthiaume, Lee|title=Indigenous Canadians remember ancestors who fought, died in war|date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Merchant Navy Remembrance Day was created by the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]], designating 3 September as a day to recognise the contributions and sacrifice of [[Canadian merchant mariners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mastermariners-capital.ca/resolutions.htm| title=R-03-2001: A Resolution to designate the 3rd of September each year as "Merchant Navy Day"| publisher=Company of Master Mariners of Canada| accessdate=7 August 2014| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414112616/http://www.mastermariners-capital.ca/resolutions.htm|archivedate=14 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In [[India]], the day is usually marked by tributes and ceremonies in army cantonments. There are memorial services in some churches such as St. Mark's Cathedral and St. John's Church in [[Bangalore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-remembrance-day-commemorated-in-bangalore-1763661 |title=Remembrance day commemorated in Bangalore &amp;#124; Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=12 November 2012 |accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Kohima]] and [[Imphal]] in the remote hillsides of [[North East India]], services of remembrance supported by the [[Indian Army]] are observed at [[Kohima War Cemetery|Kohima]] and [[Imphal War Cemetery|Imphal War Cemeteries]] (maintained by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]). The day is also marked at the [[Delhi War Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Centenary Digital |url=http://www.centenarynews.com/article/?id=1227 |title=Delhi War Cemetery marks Remembrance Day 2013 |publisher=Centenarynews.com |date= |accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other places in India this event is not observed. In 2013, [[Prince Charles]] and [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]], marked the day in [[Mumbai]]'s St. John the Evangelist Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nelson|first1=Dean|title=Prince of Wales commemorates Remembrance Sunday in India|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-charles/10438991/Prince-of-Wales-commemorates-Remembrance-Sunday-in-India.html|accessdate=5 September 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenya===
In [[Kenya]], the Kenya Armed Forces Old Comrades Association (KAFOCA) was established in Kenya immediately in 1945 to cater for the welfare of the Ex-servicemen of the First and the Second World Wars. The KAFOCA and Kenyan government recognise Remembrance Day.

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]]'s national day of remembrance is [[Anzac Day]], 25 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/nz-identity-heritage |title=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage: Anzac Day |publisher=Mch.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Poppy Day" usually occurs on the Friday before Anzac Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsa.org.nz/remem/poppy_intro.html |title=NZ Returned Services Association: Poppy Day |publisher=Rsa.org.nz |date= |accessdate=11 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019191349/http://www.rsa.org.nz/remem/poppy_intro.html |archivedate=19 October 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reason for New Zealand having their remembrance on Anzac Day happened in 1921. The paper Poppies for Armistice that year arrived by ship too late for 11 November 1921, so an RSA branch distributed them at the next commemoration date (25 April 1922, which happened to be Anzac Day) and that date stuck as the new Poppy Day in New Zealand.

Armistice Day was observed in New Zealand between the World Wars, although it was always secondary to Anzac Day. As in other countries, New Zealand's Armistice Day was converted to Remembrance Day after World War II, but this was not a success. By the mid-1950s the day was virtually ignored, even by churches and veterans' organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Robinson, 'Lest we Forget? The Fading of New Zealand War Commemorations, 1946–1966', ''New Zealand Journal of History'', 44, 1 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[New Zealand Tomb of the Unknown Warrior|Unknown Warrior]] being returned to New Zealand for Armistice Day 2004, more ceremonies are now being held in New Zealand on Armistice Day and more churches are now observing Remembrance Sunday.

===Saint Lucia===
Like Barbados, [[Saint Lucia|St. Lucia]] does not recognise Remembrance day as a public holiday. Instead, ceremonial events such as parades and other activities are held on Remembrance Sunday. The parade is held at the central square, namely the [[Derek Walcott Square]], where the [[Cenotaph]] is located. There, members of the [[Law enforcement in Saint Lucia|Royal St Lucia Police Force]] and other uniformed groups such as the St Lucia Cadet Corps pay tribute through commemoration of St. Lucian men and women who fought in the war.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, Remembrance Day is not a public holiday. Commemoration ceremonies are usually held on the nearest Sunday, at which the "Last Post" is played by a bugler followed by the observation of a two-minute silence. Ceremonies to mark the event in South Africa are held at the [[The Cenotaph, Cape Town|Cenotaph]] in [[Cape Town]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cenotaph war memorial restored in time for Remembrance Day |url=https://www.capetown.gov.za/en/Pages/CenotaphwarmemorialrestoredRemembranceDay.aspx |date=28 October 2013 |publisher=[[City of Cape Town]] |accessdate=2 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RWZevTHT?url=https://www.capetown.gov.za/en/Pages/CenotaphwarmemorialrestoredRemembranceDay.aspx |archivedate=2 August 2014 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Pretoria]] at the [[Voortrekker Monument]] cenotaph and the War Memorial at the [[Union Buildings]]. Many high schools hold Remembrance Day services to honour the past pupils who died in the two World Wars and the [[South African Border War|Border war]]. In addition, the [[South African Legion of Military Veterans]] holds a street collection on the nearest Saturday to gather funds to assist in welfare work among military veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salegion.co.za/about-the-sa-legion.html |title=About the South African Legion |publisher=SA Legion |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Remembrance Day ceremonies====
Wreath-laying ceremonies, usually organised by local branches of the [[Royal British Legion]], are observed on Remembrance Day at most war memorials across the UK at 11&amp;nbsp;am on 11 November, with [[Two-minute silence|two minutes of silence]] observed; a custom which had lapsed before a campaign for its revival began in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/515640.stm|title=UK War dead remembered |last=Hall|first=Robert|date=11 November 1999|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many employers and businesses invite their staff and customers to observe the two minutes' silence at 11:00&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=BBC | title=War dead remembered  | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/515640.stm |date=11 November 1999 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning and end of the two minutes' silence is often marked in large towns and cities by the firing of ceremonial cannon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbwm.gov.uk/web/news_20713_remembrance_arrangements.htm|title=The Royal Borough remembers&amp;nbsp;— Remembrance Day and Armistice Day arrangements|last=Anon|publisher=The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead|accessdate=6 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207012511/http://www.rbwm.gov.uk/web/news_20713_remembrance_arrangements.htm|archivedate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two-minute silence held in London (11 November 1919) was reported in the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' on 12 November 1919:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The first stroke of eleven produced a magical effect.

The tram cars glided into stillness, motors ceased to cough and fume, and stopped dead, and the mighty-limbed dray horses hunched back upon their loads and stopped also, seeming to do it of their own volition.

Someone took off his hat, and with a nervous hesitancy the rest of the men bowed their heads also. Here and there an old soldier could be detected slipping unconsciously into the posture of 'attention'. An elderly woman, not far away, wiped her eyes, and the man beside her looked white and stern. Everyone stood very still ... The hush deepened. It had spread over the whole city and become so pronounced as to impress one with a sense of audibility. It was a silence which was almost pain ... And the spirit of memory brooded over it all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/CUSTOMS/Remembrance.html|title=Remembrance Day in Britain|last=Barrow|first=Mandy|publisher=[[Woodlands Junior School]]|accessdate=11 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110170814/http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/Remembrance.html|archivedate=10 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Remembrance Sunday====
{{main|Remembrance Sunday}}

In the United Kingdom, the main observance is [[Remembrance Sunday]], held on the Sunday nearest to 11 November. There is a [[National Service of Remembrance]] in London, as well as other services and ceremonies in the regions. Typically, poppy wreaths are laid by representatives of the Crown, the armed forces, and local civic leaders, as well as by local organisations including ex-servicemen organisations, [[Cadets|cadet forces]], the [[The Scout Association|Scouts]], [[Girlguiding UK|Guides]], [[Boys' Brigade]], [[St John Ambulance]] and the [[Salvation Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hundreds turn out for Remembrance Day parade in Rugby |newspaper=[[The Rugby Advertiser]] |date=12 November 2012 |url=http://www.rugbyadvertiser.co.uk/news/hundreds-turn-out-for-remembrance-day-parade-in-rugby-1-4468602 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="BBC2016"&gt;{{cite news |title=Remembrance Sunday: Services honour war dead |date=13 November 2016 |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37965546 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A minute's or two minutes' silence is also frequently incorporated into church services.&lt;ref name="Telegraph2017"&gt;{{cite news |date=11 November 2017 |title=Armistice Day, poppies and why the act of remembrance matters |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/what-is-armistice-day-why-do-we-wear-poppies-and-when-is-remembr/ |accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Royal British Legion's Paper Poppy - white background.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Royal British Legion poppy]]
====Commemorative coins and exhibitions====
In 2014 the [[Royal Mint]] issued a colour-printed [[Alderney]] [[Five pounds (British coin)|£5 coin]], designed by engraver Laura Clancy, to commemorate Remembrance Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalmint.com/shop/The_Remembrance_Day_2014_Alderney_5_pound_Brilliant_Uncirculated_Coin|title=The Remembrance Day 2014 Alderney £5 Brilliant Uncirculated Coin|author=Darrell|work=The Royal Mint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2014, to commemorate the outbreak of World War I a huge display called [[Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red]], consisting of 888,246 ceramic poppies was installed in the moat of the [[Tower of London]], each poppy representing a British Empire fatality.

On 5 November 2018 and set to continue for 4 months, about 10,000 torches were lit at the foot of the Tower’s walls, in its dry [[moat]] to mark the [[centenary]] of the end of the World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/05/tower-of-london-lights-up-in-stunning-armistice-memorial|title=Tower of London lights up in stunning Armistice memorial|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
Remembrance Day is officially observed in [[Northern Ireland]] in the same way as in the rest of United Kingdom, although it tends to be associated more with the [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] community. Most [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] and [[Irish republicanism|republicans]] do not take part in the public commemoration of British soldiers organized by the Royal British Legion. This is mainly due to the [[Operation Banner#Controversies|actions of the British Army]] during [[The Troubles]]. However, some moderate nationalists began to attend Remembrance Day events as a way to connect with the unionist community. In 1987 a [[Remembrance Day bombing|bomb was detonated]] by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) just before a Remembrance Sunday ceremony in [[Enniskillen]], killing eleven people. The IRA said it had made a mistake and had been targeting soldiers parading to the war memorial. The bombing was widely condemned and attendance at Remembrance events, by both nationalists and unionists, rose in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Robinson, 'Remembering War in the Midst of Conflict: First World War Commemorations in the Northern Irish Troubles', ''20th Century British History'', 21, 1 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republic of Ireland]] has a [[National Day of Commemoration]] in July for all [[Irish people]] who have died in war.

==Similar observances outside the Commonwealth==

===France and Belgium===
[[File:Bleuet de France circa 1950.jpg|thumb|''Bleuet de France'', circa 1950]]
Remembrance Day (11 November) is a national holiday in France and Belgium. It commemorates the armistice signed between the Allies and Germany at Compiègne, France, for the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front, which took effect at 11:00&amp;nbsp;am—the "eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month." Armistice Day is one of the most important military celebrations in France, since it was a major French victory and the French paid a heavy price in blood to achieve it. The First World War was considered in France as the "Great Patriotic War".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Baptiste Duroselle, ''La Grande Guerre des Français 1914–1918'' (''The Great War of the French 1914–1918''), Perrin, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all French villages feature memorials dedicated to those fallen during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;''Les lieux de mémoire'' (''Places of Memory''), under the direction of Pierre Nora, Gallimard, Paris, 1997, 3 volumes&lt;/ref&gt; In France the blue [[cornflower]] ''([[Bleuet de France]])'' is used symbolically rather than the poppy.

=== Denmark ===
In 2009 the Danish government established Veterans' Day with early events on 5 September where past and present members of the armed forces, who have done service in armed conflict, are remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arbejderen.dk/indland/anerkendelse-er-mere-end-en-flagdag |title=Anerkendelse er mere end en flagdag &amp;#124; Arbejderen |language=da |publisher=Arbejderen.dk |date= |accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the major German churches has its own festivals for commemorating the dead, observed in November: [[All Souls Day]] in the case of the Roman Catholic Church, ''[[Totensonntag|Ewigkeitssonntag]]'' or "Eternity Sunday" in the case of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church.

Although Hong Kong ceased to be part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in 1997, the memorial service still resembles those in many other Commonwealth countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harper honours Canadian war dead in Hong Kong on Remembrance Day |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/harper-honours-canadian-war-dead-in-hong-kong-on-remembrance-day/article5182285/ |accessdate=20 November 2018 |publisher=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service includes the sounding of "[[Last Post]]", two minutes of silence, the sounding of "[[The Rouse|Reveille]]", the laying of wreaths, and prayers, and ends with a recitation of the "[[Ode of Remembrance]]". The [[Hong Kong Police Band]] continues to perform their ceremonial duty at the service. Members of the [[Hong Kong Air Cadet Corps]] (including the [[Ceremonial Squadron]]), [[Hong Kong Adventure Corps]], [[Hong Kong Sea Cadet Corps]] and scouting organisations are also in attendance.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], Armistice or Remembrance Day is not a public holiday. In July there is a [[National Day of Commemoration]] for Irish men and women who have died in war. Nevertheless, Remembrance Sunday is marked by a ceremony in [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]], which the [[President of Ireland]] attends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1650036.stm | work=BBC News | title=Northern Ireland honours war dead | date=11 November 2001 | accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=9 November 2003 – 11:09:32 |url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/kfcwauqlaukf/ |title=President to attend Remembrance Day ceremony in Dublin |publisher=BreakingNews.ie |date=18 February 2008 |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/1111/6news_av.html?2307800,null,230 ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108071008/http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/1111/6news_av.html?2307800%2Cnull%2C230 |date= 8 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I, many Irishmen served in the British Army, but official commemoration of them (and other British soldiers) has been controversial. The British Army was used to suppress the [[Easter Rising]] (1916) and fought the forces of the [[Irish Republic]] during the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–22). A very small number of people living in the Republic still enlist in the British Army,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/north-and-south-of-ireland-fighting-the-taliban-together-13922458.html |title=North and South of Ireland fighting the Taliban together |publisher=Belfasttelegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bootcamp Ireland |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/irish-soldier-killed-in-bomb-blast-told-of-afghan-fears-1470617.html |title=Irish soldier killed in bomb blast told of Afghan fears – National News, Frontpage |publisher=Independent.ie |date= 6 September 2008|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Self-catering |url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/jobs-careers/the-irish-recruits-who-fight-for-queen-and-country-1502910.html |title=The Irish recruits who fight for Queen and country – Jobs &amp; Careers, Lifestyle |publisher=Independent.ie |date= 18 October 2008|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the British Army is banned from recruiting there under the ''Defence Act 1954''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1954/en/act/pub/0018/print.html |title=Defence Act, 1954 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=13 May 1954 |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anphoblacht.com/news/detail/39792 |title=Taxpayers' money used for British Army recruitment in Limerick |publisher=An Phoblacht |date= |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Irish National War Memorial Gardens]] in Dublin is dedicated to the memory of the 49,400 Irish soldiers who were killed in action in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/index.asp?docID=2746 |title=Department of Taoiseach |publisher=Taoiseach.gov.ie |date= |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In [[Israel]] there are two ceremonies, the first being in [[Jerusalem]], at the [[Jerusalem British War Cemetery|British War Cemetery]] on the Saturday before Remembrance Sunday, organised by the British Consul in Jerusalem. The second ceremony is in [[Ramleh Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery|Ramleh]] on the Sunday itself, organised by the British embassy in [[Tel Aviv]]. The Ramleh ceremony is the larger, and is also attended by veterans of the Second World War.

===Italy===
In Italy, soldiers who died for the nation are remembered on 4 November, when the ceasefire that followed the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] in 1918 began. The Day is known as the ''Day of National Unity Day of the Armed Forces'', ''Giorno dell'Unità Nazionale Giornata delle Forze Armate'' in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.governo.it/GovernoInforma/Dossier/4_novembre_2010/celebrazioni.html |title=4 novembre 2010 – Giorno dell'Unità Nazionale Giornata delle Forze Armate |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1977, this day has not been a public holiday; now, many services are held on the first Sunday in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governo.it/Presidenza/cerimoniale/varie/legge_260.pdf |title=From the Italian government website |publisher=Governo.it |date= |accessdate=23 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325095202/http://www.governo.it/Presidenza/cerimoniale/varie/legge_260.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
{{main|Remembrance of the Dead}}
In the [[Netherlands]], [[Remembrance of the Dead|Remembrance Day]] is commemorated annually on 4 May. It is not a public holiday. Throughout the country, military personnel and civilians fallen in various conflicts since World War II are remembered. The main ceremonies are at the [[Waalsdorpervlakte]] near [[The Hague]], the [[Grebbeberg]] near [[Wageningen]] and [[Dam Square]] in Amsterdam. Two minutes of silence are observed at 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm. Remembrance Day is followed by [[Liberation Day (The Netherlands)|Liberation Day]] on 5 May.

===Norway===
{{main|Veterans Day (Norway)}}
In [[Norway]] the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]] commemorate Veteran's Day. The Norwegian Parliament, the [[Storting]], decreed that Veteran's Day would be observed on the same day as [[Victory in Europe Day]], in Norway known as "Frigjøringsdagen", or Liberation Day. The ceremonies are held annually in [[Akershus Fortress]], with the [[King of Norway]], [[Harald V]], present. The first of such ceremonies was held on 8 May 2011, with two [[Forsvarets Spesialkommando|Norwegian Special Forces Operators]] being awarded the [[War Cross (Norway)|War Cross]] for deployments in the recent [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]]. The ceremonies are observed with memorials and military salutes.

===Poland===
{{main|Polish Independence Day}}
11 November is a public holiday in Poland called [[Polish Independence Day|Independence Day]], as the ending of First World War allowed Polish people to regain the freedom and unity of their country after over a hundred years of partitions. Major events include laying flowers on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by members of the government and highest authorities, other public ceremonies and church services and school celebrations.

===Serbia===

It has been a statutory holiday in [[Serbia]] since 2012. Serbia is an Allied force that suffered [[World War I casualties|the biggest casualty rate in World War I]]. To commemorate their victims, people in Serbia wear [[Ramonda nathaliae|Natalie's ramonda]] as a symbol of remembrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.b92.net/eng/news/society.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=09&amp;nav_id=83083|title=Serbia to mark Armistice Day as state holiday|date=9 November 2012|access-date=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
&lt;!--This section uses American English.--&gt;
[[Veterans Day]] is observed in the United States on 11 November, and is both a federal holiday and a state holiday in all states. However, the function of the observance elsewhere is more closely matched by [[Memorial Day]] in May. In the United States, and some other allied nations, 11 November was formerly known as Armistice Day; in the United States it was given its new name in 1954 at the end of the [[Korean War]] to honour all veterans. Veterans Day is observed with memorial ceremonies, salutes at military cemeteries, and parades.

The '''Southern Theatre''' is an historic [[theater (structure)|theater]] located at 21 East Main Street in [[downtown Columbus, Ohio|downtown]] [[Columbus, Ohio]]. It opened on September 21, 1896 and is the oldest surviving theater in Central Ohio and one of the oldest in the state of [[Ohio]]. The Southern Theatre is currently owned and operated as a home for live concerts, plays and opera by CAPA (the [[Columbus Association for the Performing Arts]]). CAPA also manages several other venues in Columbus including the [[Ohio Theatre (Columbus)|Ohio]], the [[Palace Theatre (Columbus, Ohio)|Palace]], and the [[Lincoln Theatre (Columbus, Ohio)|Lincoln Theatre]]s.&lt;ref name="capav"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capa.com/columbus/venues/|title=CAPA, Venues|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Design===
Between 1889 and 1893 a series of fires destroyed five downtown Columbus theaters. As a result, a group of businessmen decided to develop a new hotel and theater with modern construction and safety features on the southern edge of downtown. The building was called "The Great Southern Fireproof Hotel and Opera House", and was designed by the local architectural firm of Dauben, Krumm, and Riebel. Construction began in 1894. Both the theater and the hotel were constructed of "fireproof" tile, brick, iron, steel, and concrete.&lt;ref name=capa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capa.com/venues/southern-theatre/theatre-history|title=Southern Theatre History|accessdate=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater's auditorium design was progressive for its day and was reminiscent of [[Louis H. Sullivan]]'s 1891 [[Garrick Theater (Chicago)|Schiller Theatre]] in Chicago. From the [[proscenium]] opening, a series of concentric arches dotted with incandescent electric lights radiate into the house, resulting in superior lighting and excellent acoustics. Built to be self-sufficient, the theater, one of the first commercial buildings in Columbus to use electricity, [[electricity generation|generated]] its own power. Additionally, the building had three [[water well|wells]] in the basement, from which it produced its own water supply.&lt;ref name=capa/&gt; The theatre currently seats 933&lt;ref name="CJO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzartsgroup.org/cjo/venue.php |title=Columbus Jazz Orchestra |accessdate=2009-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205065450/http://jazzartsgroup.org/cjo/venue.php |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an intimate "jewel box" type theater with two balconies.

In 1982, the Southern Theatre and its associated hotel were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=nris /&gt;

===Use===
The Great Southern Theatre originally hosted theatrical touring productions. [[Sarah Bernhardt]] was just one of the famous performers to play the theater in its first two decades. In the 1910s and 1920s the theater, now called the Southern, featured first run [[silent films]] and live [[vaudeville]]. From the 1930s on, the Southern was a popular home for second-run double features. In the 1970s the theater briefly returned to first run fare as the Towne Cinema, showing black exploitation movies. Throughout the 1970s the Southern also hosted a weekly live Country Music Jamboree, sponsored by local radio station [[WMNI]].&lt;ref name=capa/&gt;

The theater closed in 1979 and in 1986 was acquired by CAPA. After sitting empty for nearly two decades, the Southern was completely restored by CAPA in 1997-98 during an extensive 14-month rebuilding process. The newly restored Southern Theatre reopened on September 26, 1998.

'''Super Bowl LIII''', the 53rd [[Super Bowl]] and the 49th modern-era [[National Football League]] (NFL) championship game, will decide the league champion for the [[2018 NFL season]]. The game is scheduled to be played on February 3, 2019, at [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. This will be the third Super Bowl in Atlanta, having previously hosted [[Super Bowl XXVIII]] in 1994 and [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] in 2000 at the [[Georgia Dome]].

== Background ==
===Host-selection process===
[[File:Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Jan 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Mercedes-Benz Stadium, host venue of Super Bowl LIII.]]
On May 19, 2015, the league announced the four finalists that will compete to host Super Bowl LIII in 2019, LIV in 2020, and LV in 2021. NFL owners voted on these cities on May 24, 2016, with the first round of voting determining the host for Super Bowl LIII, the second round deciding a different site for [[Super Bowl LIV]], and the third round deciding the site for [[Super Bowl LV]]. The four finalists for Super Bowl LIII, all in the [[Southeastern United States]], were:&lt;ref name="CBS20150519"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25190240/finalists-for-2019-2020-super-bowls-atlanta-miami-new-orleans-tampa | title=Finalists for 2019, 2020 Super Bowls: Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans, Tampa | publisher=CBS Sports | first=Sean | last=Wagner-McGough | date=May 19, 2015 | accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN20150519"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12916777/atlanta-miami-new-orleans-tampa-bidding-2019-2020-super-bowls | title=Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans, Tampa eye 2019, 2020 Super Bowls | publisher=ESPN | first=Mike | last=Triplett | date=May 19, 2015 | accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]], [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]: This will be the first Super Bowl played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium after it opened in 2017. The city has previously hosted two Super Bowls at the [[Georgia Dome]], with the last being [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] in 2000. 
* [[Hard Rock Stadium]], [[Miami Gardens, Florida]]: South Florida has previously hosted 10 Super Bowls, with the last being [[Super Bowl XLIV]] in 2010.
* [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]], [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]]: New Orleans has previously hosted 10 Super Bowls, with the last being [[Super Bowl XLVII]] in 2013.
* [[Raymond James Stadium]], [[Tampa, Florida]]: Tampa has hosted four Super Bowls, with the last being [[Super Bowl XLIII]] in 2009.

After three votes, Atlanta was awarded Super Bowl LIII at the NFL owners' meeting on May 24, 2016. The losing candidates, except for New Orleans which removed itself from the voting for all games except Super Bowl LIII due to event conflicts in 2020 and 2021, were then pitted against [[Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park]] in [[Inglewood, California]] for [[Super Bowl LIV]] and [[Super Bowl LV]] hosting rights. Miami eventually won the rights to host [[Super Bowl LIV]], and Los Angeles won the rights to host Super Bowl LV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Gregg|title=Atlanta, South Florida, L.A. chosen to host Super Bowls|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000664704/article/atlanta-south-florida-la-chosen-to-host-super-bowls|website=NFL.com|accessdate=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/live-updates-nfl-announcing-sites-for-super-bowls-53-54-55|title=NFL awards future Super Bowls to Atlanta, South Florida and Los Angeles|publisher=CBS Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, on May 23, 2017, NFL owners opted to award [[Super Bowl LV]] to Tampa and give [[Super Bowl LVI]] to Los Angeles after it was announced that [[Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park]] would open in 2020 due to construction delays. New Orleans would be awarded [[Super Bowl LVIII]].

The NFL unveiled the official logo for Super Bowl LIII in February 2018; it is a navy blue-tinted version of the design introduced at [[Super Bowl LI]], and the overall branding of the game will feature use of blue and red. The host committee logo features a stylized overhead rendition of Mercedes-Benz Stadium's roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.myajc.com/sports/leadoff-atlanta-super-bowl-gets-second-logo-from-nfl/ZD3mMsWBQy11SELltjcByH/|title=LEADOFF: Atlanta’s Super Bowl gets a second logo from NFL|work=Atlanta Journal Constitution|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Oswald goes to a dental clinic for treatment to his cavity problem. While the dentist tries to pull out his damaged tooth, news break out of a radio in the shop, reporting that the king is in serious depression and needs to be cheered up. In this, Oswald abandons his dental treatment, and heads outside to spread the word.

In his castle, [[Old King Cole]] &lt;ref&gt;Jeff Lenburg, "The Great Cartoon Directors", Da Capo Press, 1993, page 164.&lt;/ref&gt; is having a long face for some reason. His personal jester tries to brighten him up but to no avail, and therefore leaves the throne room. Oswald then shows up and reads to him a book of comical rhymes. The rabbit's attempt helps a little and the king's mood improves slightly. Other entertainers (caricatures of film comedians [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], The [[Marx Brothers]] and [[Jimmy Durante]] &lt;ref&gt;Jeff Lenburg, "The Great Cartoon Directors", Da Capo Press, 1993, page 164.&lt;/ref&gt;) also come in for a similar cause. Each of them has a distinctive method in providing comedy. It all comes down when some of them employs an act that involves hurling pies at each other. Eventually, everyone in the room joins the food fight, and so does the king who starts to enjoy it.

Momentarilly, the jester returns to the throne room to see what is happening. Upon noticing the king back in good spirits, the jester grows envious, and decides to take his grudge on one of the entertainers. The jester captures Oswald and brings the rabbit into a torture chamber at a basement of the castle. He then puts a noose around Oswald's neck, with other end of the rope being pulled by three elephants. Oswald finds this ordeal impossible to get out of.

It appears the experience at the castle was nothing more than a nightmare as Oswald wakes up and sees himself still at the dental clinic. The dentist, at last, succeeds in extracting the tooth, and Oswald is relieved of his dental worries.

==Availability==
The short is available on ''[[The Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection]]'' DVD box set.

'''The Ratman of Southend''' is an English [[urban legend]] originating in [[Southend-on-Sea]], [[Essex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Haunted-Southend-Dee-Gordon/dp/075246082X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1468704278&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=haunted+southend|title=Haunted Southend|first=Dee|last=Gordon|date=1 January 2012|publisher=The History Press|accessdate=5 June 2017|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The story of the Ratman tells of an old homeless man, seeking shelter from the cold in an underpass, was set upon by a group of youths and beaten to near-death, cold and blood loss doing the rest. As he died, the numerous vermin who inhabit the area gathered, and were found to have devoured his face. After this, a ghostly figure was spotted in the underpass, with people hearing ratlike squealing, and scraping, as if large claws were moving across the walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stuff-Brits-Like-Guide-Britain-ebook/dp/B01HPVH8II/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1468704408&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=stuff+brits+like|title=Stuff Brits Like: A Guide to What's Great about Great Britain|first=Fraser|last=McAlpine|date=24 June 2014|publisher=Nicholas Brealey Publishing|accessdate=5 June 2017|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4105">The '''Toronto Fringe Festival''' is an annual theatre [[festival]], featuring un-juried plays by unknown or well-known artists, taking place in the theatres of [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. Several productions originally mounted at the Fringe have later been remounted for larger audiences, including the [[Tony Award]]-winning [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[The Drowsy Chaperone]]''.

== Features ==

The Toronto Fringe Festival started in 1989. Today the festival presents over 150 individual productions from Canada and around the world. It is well known for not having a jury to judge which plays will be presented.  Instead it uses a lottery system which gives each play an equal chance.  It depends mostly on volunteers, donors/sponsors, and government grants.  One notable feature is the 24-hour playwriting contest in which contestants write a play in one day based on items selected by the Fringe and the winning play is performed on the last day of the festival.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In 2008 "The Fringe of Toronto" launched a second festival called "The Next Stage Festival" (NSTF) which takes place annually in January. Unlike the summer festival, NSTF is juried and presents both new and remounted projects by "Fringe Artists". Also, unlike the summer Fringe Festival NSTF only showcases 8 productions.

NSTF was the first major step in the organization branching out to a year-round support organization that brings many opportunities to artists and arts-lovers. Since the launch of NSTF "The Toronto Fringe" has also introduced a number of artists outreach programs including The Fringe Evolution Fund to help independent producers remount their shows outside of the festival, and youth outreach programs including 10x10x10 which distributes 1,000 rush passes to priority youth in and around Toronto.

In 2010 the Toronto Fringe launched a new and expanded Fringe Club featuring free nightly entertainment, an expanded beer tent, a public stage called "Postscript Patio", art installations called Fringe-Pretty-Things, and food service provided by local restaurants.
2011 saw the grand opening of yet another expansion, this time a year-round fixture called "The Fringe Creation Lab".The Creation Lab is the new home of the Toronto Fringe and the indie arts community. The Lab consists of two studio spaces and the Toronto Fringe admin office, both housed on the 4th floor of the Centre for Social Innovation in the Annex. (Just steps away from Bathurst Station.) Both studios are available for anyone to rent at any time to do whatever they want. The spaces can be rented at various levels of subsidy, on a first-come, first-served basis. The studios are already a buzzing arts hub, bookable all hours of the day and night, where artists can focus on their craft and connect with their community without breaking the bank

It seems nearly all members of Toronto's professional theatre scene have performed in, or written a Fringe show at some point in their careers. Some notable productions include ''[[Da Kink in My Hair]]'', which was later developed into a TV show by GlobalTV; and ''[[The Drowsy Chaperone]]'', which went on to Broadway and several world tours. In 2009, ''My Mother's Lesbian Jewish-Wiccan Wedding'' was picked up by Mirvish Productions from the festival and opened only 3 months later at Toronto's [[Panasonic Theatre]]. ''[[Kim's Convenience (play)|Kim's Convenience]]'', winner of the 2011 Best New Play award, was remounted in 2012 by [[Soulpepper Theatre]], and went on to become the successful TV series ''[[Kim's Convenience (tv series)|Kim's Convenience]]'' .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20842">Elections to [[Trafford]] Council were held on 3 May 1984.  One third of the council was up for election, with each successful candidate to serve a four-year term of office, expiring in 1988. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] retained overall control of the council.&lt;ref&gt;"Trafford M. B. C. Election Results Sheet, 29 June 1984", Trafford M.B.C.(1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the death of one of the candidates for Timperley ward after the close of nominations, the election for Timperley was postponed until 28 June 1984. The result shown on this page is the result of that election.

After the election, the composition of the council was as follows:
