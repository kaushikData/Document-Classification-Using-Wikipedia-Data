      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="483">In [[mathematical logic]], an '''algebraic definition''' is one that can be given using only equations between terms with [[free variable]]s.  Inequalities and quantifiers are specifically disallowed.

Saying that a definition is algebraic is a stronger condition than saying it is [[elementary definition|elementary]].

&lt;!---the above disambiguation link does make sense when this article is reached via the REDIRECT from "probability 1"---&gt;
In [[probability theory]], one says that an [[event (probability theory)|event]] happens '''almost surely''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''a.s.''') if it happens with probability one. In other words, the set of possible exceptions may be non-empty, but it has probability zero. The concept is precisely the same as the concept of "[[almost everywhere]]" in [[measure theory]].

In probability experiments on a finite [[sample space]], there is often no difference between ''almost surely'' and ''surely''. However, the distinction becomes important when the [[sample space]] is an [[infinite set]], because an infinite set can have non-empty subsets of probability zero.

Some examples of the use of this concept include the strong and uniform versions of the [[law of large numbers]], and the continuity of the paths of [[Brownian motion]].

The terms '''almost certainly''' (a.c.) and '''almost always''' (a.a.) are also used. '''Almost never''' describes the opposite of ''almost surely'': an event that happens with probability zero happens ''almost never''.&lt;ref name=Gradel&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grädel |first1=Erich |last2=Kolaitis |first2=Phokion G. |last3=Libkin |first3=Leonid | author3-link=Leonid Libkin |last4=Marx |first4=Maarten |last5=Spencer |first5=Joel |last6=Vardi |first6=Moshe Y. |last7=Venema |first7=Yde |last8=Weinstein |first8=Scott |title=Finite Model Theory and Its Applications |date=2007 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-00428-8 |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[probability space]]. An [[event (probability theory)|event]] &lt;math&gt;E \in \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; happens ''almost surely'' if &lt;math&gt;P(E)=1&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; happens almost surely if the probability of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; not occurring is [[0 (number)|zero]]: &lt;math&gt;P(E^C) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. More generally, any event &lt;math&gt;E \subseteq \Omega&lt;/math&gt; (not necessarily in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;) happens almost surely if &lt;math&gt;E^C&lt;/math&gt; is contained in a [[null set]]: a subset of some &lt;math&gt;N\in\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; such that {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;P(N)=0&lt;/math&gt;.}}&lt;ref name="Jacod"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacod|first=Jean|author2=Protter, |year=2004|title=Probability Essentials|publisher=Springer|page=37|isbn=978-3-540-438717}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of almost sureness depends on the probability measure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. If it is necessary to emphasize this dependence, it is customary to say that the event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; occurs ''P''-almost surely, or almost surely (''P'').

==Illustrative examples==
In general, an event can happen "almost surely" even if the probability space in question includes outcomes which do not belong to the event, as is illustrated in the examples below.

===Throwing a dart===
Imagine throwing a dart at a unit square (i.e. a square with area 1) so that the dart always hits exactly one point of the square, and so that each point in the square is equally likely to be hit. 

Now, notice that since the square has area 1, the probability that the dart will hit any particular subregion of the square equals the area of that subregion. For example, the probability that the dart will hit the right half of the square is 0.5, since the right half has area 0.5.

Next, consider the event that "the dart hits a diagonal of the unit square exactly". Since the areas of the diagonals of the square are zero, the probability that the dart lands exactly on a diagonal is zero. So, the dart will '''almost never''' land on a diagonal (i.e. it will '''almost surely''' ''not'' land on a diagonal). Nonetheless the set of points on the diagonals is not empty and a point on a diagonal is no less possible than any other point: the diagonal does contain valid outcomes of the experiment.

===Tossing a coin repeatedly===
Consider the case where a (possibly biased) coin is tossed, corresponding to the probability space &lt;math&gt;(\{H,T\}, 2^{\{H, T\}}, P)&lt;/math&gt;, where the event &lt;math&gt;\{H\}&lt;/math&gt; occurs if heads is flipped, and &lt;math&gt;\{T\}&lt;/math&gt; if tails. For this particular coin, assume the probability of flipping heads is &lt;math&gt;P(H) = p\in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt; from which it follows that the complement event, flipping tails, has &lt;math&gt;P(T) = 1 - p&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose we were to conduct an experiment where the coin is tossed repeatedly, with outcomes &lt;math&gt;\omega_1,\omega_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, and it is assumed each flip's outcome is independent of all the others. That is, they are [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|''i.i.d.'']]. Define the sequence of random variables on the coin toss space, &lt;math&gt;(X_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X_i(\omega)=\omega_i&lt;/math&gt;. ''i.e.'' each &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; records the outcome of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th flip.

Any infinite sequence of heads and tails is a possible outcome of the experiment.  However, any particular infinite sequence of heads and tails has probability zero of being the exact outcome of the (infinite) experiment.  To see why, note that the [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|''i.i.d.'']] assumption implies that the probability of flipping all heads over &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; flips is simply &lt;math&gt;P(X_i = H, \ i=1,2,\dots,n)=\left(P(X_1 = H)\right)^n = p^n&lt;/math&gt;. Letting &lt;math&gt;n\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; yields zero, since &lt;math&gt;p\in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt; by assumption. Note that the result is the same no matter how much we bias the coin towards heads, so long as we constrain &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to be greater than 0, and less than 1.

In particular, the event "the sequence contains at least one &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;" happens almost surely (i.e., with probability 1).
However, if instead of an infinite number of flips we stop flipping after some finite time, say a million flips, then the all-heads sequence has non-zero probability. The all-heads sequence has probability &lt;math&gt;p^{1,000,000}\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, while the probability of getting at least one tails is &lt;math&gt;1 - p^{1,000,000}&lt;/math&gt; and the event is no longer '''almost sure'''.

==Asymptotically almost surely==
In [[asymptotic analysis]], one says that a property holds '''asymptotically almost surely''' ('''a.a.s.''') if, over a sequence of sets, the probability converges to 1. For instance, a large number is asymptotically almost surely [[composite number|composite]], by the [[prime number theorem]]; and in [[random graph|random graph theory]], the statement "&lt;math&gt;G(n,p_n)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connected]]" (where [[Erdős–Rényi model|&lt;math&gt;G(n,p)&lt;/math&gt;]] denotes the graphs on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices with edge probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;) is true a.a.s. when, for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p_n &lt; \tfrac{(1+\varepsilon) \ln n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=RandGraph&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friedgut |first1=Ehud |last2=Rödl |first2=Vojtech |last3=Rucinski |first3=Andrzej |last4=Tetali |first4=Prasad|author4-link= Prasad V.

In [[number theory]] this is referred to as "[[almost all]]", as in "almost all numbers are composite". Similarly, in graph theory, this is sometimes referred to as "almost surely".&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite book |last=Spencer |first=Joel H. |title=The Strange Logic of Random Graphs |publisher=Springer |date=2001 |series=Algorithms and Combinatorics |volume=22 |isbn=978-3540416548 |chapter=0.

==Education and early life==
Wiles was born on 11 April &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://famous-mathematicians.com/andrew-wiles/|title=Andrew Wiles|website=famous-mathematicians.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1953 in [[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]], England, the son of [[Maurice Wiles|Maurice Frank Wiles]] (1923–2005), the [[Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford]],&lt;ref name="whoswho"/&gt; and Patricia Wiles (née Mowll). His father worked as the Chaplain at [[Ridley Hall, Cambridge]], for the years 1952–55. Wiles attended King's College School, Cambridge, and [[The Leys School, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambridge-born mathematician awarded top prize for solving centuries-old numerical problem|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/cambridge-born-mathematician-awarded-prize/story-28927992-detail/story.html|accessdate=16 March 2016|publisher=[[Cambridge News]]}}{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiles states that he came across Fermat's Last Theorem on his way home from school when he was 10 years old. He stopped at his local library where he found a book about the theorem.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Fascinated by the existence of a theorem that was so easy to state that he, a ten-year-old, could understand it, but that no one had proven, he decided to be the first person to prove it. However, he soon realised that his knowledge was too limited, so he abandoned his childhood dream, until it was brought back to his attention at the age of 33 by [[Ken Ribet]]'s 1986 proof of the [[epsilon conjecture]], which [[Gerhard Frey]] had previously linked to Fermat's famous equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Sooyoung|title=Academic Genealogy of Mathematicians|date=2011|isbn=9789814282291|page=207|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4siw31DPONUC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and research==
Wiles earned his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[mathematics]] in 1974 at [[Merton College, Oxford]], and a PhD in 1980 as a graduate student of [[Clare College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=wphd&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|title=Reciprocity laws and the conjecture of birch and swinnerton-dyer|first= Andrew John|last=Wiles|date=1978|url=http://ulmss-newton.lib.cam.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=15254|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.477263}}|website=lib.cam.ac.uk|oclc=500589130}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a stay at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] in 1981, Wiles became a [[Princeton University Department of Mathematics|Professor of Mathematics]] at [[Princeton University]]. In 1985–86, Wiles was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] near Paris and at the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. From 1988 to 1990, Wiles was a [[Royal Society]] Research Professor at the [[University of Oxford]], and then he returned to Princeton. From 1994 - 2009, Wiles was a [[Eugene Higgins Professor]] at Princeton. He rejoined Oxford in 2011 as Royal Society Research Professor.&lt;ref name=andrew&gt;{{cite web|first1=John J.|last1=O'Connor|first2=Edmund F.|last2=Robertson|title=Wiles Biography|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Wiles.html|publisher=[[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]]|date=September 2009|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018 he was appointed [[Regius Professor]] of Mathematics at Oxford, the first in the university's history.&lt;ref name="RProf"/&gt; 

Wiles's graduate research was guided by [[John Coates (mathematician)|John Coates]] beginning in the summer of 1975. Together these colleagues worked on the arithmetic of [[elliptic curve]]s with [[complex multiplication]] by the methods of [[Iwasawa theory]]. He further worked with [[Barry Mazur]] on the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory over the [[rational number]]s, and soon afterward, he generalised this result to [[totally real field]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Wiles|url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/3001745.html|publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His biographical page at Princeton University's website states that "Andrew has few equals in terms of his impact on modern number theory. Many of the world’s very best young number theorists received their Ph.D.’s under Andrew ... and many of these are today leaders and professors at top institutions around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dof.princeton.edu/about/clerk-faculty/emeritus/andrew-john-wiles|title=Andrew John Wiles - Dean of the Faculty|website=dof.princeton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem===
{{main|Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem}}
Starting in mid-1986, based on successive progress of the previous few years of [[Gerhard Frey]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Ken Ribet]], it became clear that [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] could be proven as a corollary of a limited form of the [[modularity theorem]] (unproven at the time and then known as the "Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture"). The modularity theorem involved elliptic curves, which was also Wiles's own specialist area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Peter|title=How Math's Most Famous Proof Nearly Broke|url=http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-maths-most-famous-proof-nearly-broke|publisher=Nautilus|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as important, but extraordinarily difficult or perhaps impossible to prove.&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;[[Simon Singh]] (1997). ''Fermat's Last Theorem''. {{ISBN|1-85702-521-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|203–205, 223, 226}} For example, Wiles's ex-supervisor [[John H. Coates|John Coates]] states that it seemed "impossible to actually prove",&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;{{rp|226}} and [[Ken Ribet]] considered himself "one of the vast majority of people who believed [it] was completely inaccessible", adding that "Andrew Wiles was probably one of the few people on earth who had the audacity to dream that you can actually go and prove [it]."&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt;{{rp|223}}

Despite this, Wiles, with his from-childhood fascination with Fermat's Last Theorem, decided to undertake the challenge of proving the conjecture, at least to the extent needed for [[Frey's elliptic curve|Frey's curve]].&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;{{rp|226}} He dedicated all of his research time to this problem for over six years in near-total secrecy, covering up his efforts by releasing prior work in small segments as separate papers and confiding only in his wife.&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;{{rp|229–230}}

In June 1993, he presented his proof to the public for the first time at a conference in Cambridge.
{{quote|He gave a lecture a day on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday with the title 'Modular Forms, Elliptic Curves and Galois Representations.' There was no hint in the title that Fermat's last theorem would be discussed, Dr. Ribet said. ... Finally, at the end of his third lecture, Dr. Wiles concluded that he had proved a general case of the Taniyama conjecture. Then, seemingly as an afterthought, he noted that that meant that Fermat's last theorem was true. Q.E.D.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Kolata|first=Gina|title=At Last, Shout of 'Eureka!'

In August 1993, it was discovered that the proof contained a flaw in one area. Wiles tried and failed for over a year to repair his proof. According to Wiles, the crucial idea for circumventing, rather than closing this area, came to him on 19 September 1994, when he was on the verge of giving up. Together with his former student [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]], he published a second paper which circumvented the problem and thus completed the proof. Both papers were published in May 1995 in a dedicated issue of the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiles|first=Andrew|date=May 1995|title=Issue 3|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/i310703|journal=Annals of Mathematics|volume=141|pages=1-551|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are mathematicians finally satisfied with Andrew Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem?

Wiles's 1987 certificate of election to the [[Royal Society]] reads:
{{Block quote|Andrew Wiles is almost unique amongst number-theorists in his ability to bring to bear new tools and new ideas on some of the most intractable problems of number theory. His finest achievement to date has been his proof, in joint work with [[Barry Mazur|Mazur]], of the "main conjecture" of Iwasawa theory for cyclotomic extensions of the rational field. This work settles many of the basic problems on [[cyclotomic field]]s which go back to Kummer, and is unquestionably one of the major advances in number theory in our times. Earlier he did deep work on the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer for elliptic curves with complex multiplication – one offshoot of this was his proof of an unexpected and beautiful generalisation of the classical explicit reciprocity laws of Artin–Hasse–Iwasawa. Most recently, he has made new progress on the construction of l-adic representations attached to Hilbert modular forms, and has applied these to prove the "main conjecture" for cyclotomic extensions of totally real fields – again a remarkable result since none of the classical tools of cyclotomic fields applied to these problems.&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1989%2F39%27) |title = EC/1989/39: Wiles, Sir Andrew John |publisher=[[The Royal Society]]|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9344">In [[mathematics]], an '''asymptotic expansion''', '''asymptotic series''' or '''Poincaré expansion''' (after [[Henri Poincaré]]) is a [[formal series]] of functions which has the property that [[truncation|truncating]] the series after a finite number of terms provides an approximation to a given function as the argument of the function tends towards a particular, often infinite, point. Investigations by {{Harvtxt|Dingle|1973}} revealed that the divergent part of an asymptotic expansion is latently meaningful, i.e. contains information about the exact value of the expanded function.

The most common type of asymptotic expansion is a power series in either positive or negative powers. Methods of generating such expansions include the [[Euler–Maclaurin summation formula]] and integral transforms such as the [[Laplace transform|Laplace]] and [[Mellin transform|Mellin]] transforms. Repeated [[integration by parts]] will often lead to an asymptotic expansion.

Since a ''[[Convergence (mathematics)|convergent]]'' [[Taylor series]] fits the definition of asymptotic expansion as well, the phrase "asymptotic series" usually implies a ''non-convergent'' series. Despite non-convergence, the asymptotic expansion is useful when truncated to a finite number of terms. The approximation may provide benefits by being more mathematically tractable than the function being expanded, or by an increase in the speed of computation of the expanded function. Typically, the best approximation is given when the series is truncated at the smallest term. This way of optimally truncating an asymptotic expansion is known as '''superasymptotics'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=John P.|last= Boyd|title= The Devil's Invention: Asymptotic, Superasymptotic and Hyperasymptotic Series |journal= [[Acta Applicandae Mathematicae]] |volume=56|issue=1|pages=1–98|year=1999|doi=10.1023/A:1006145903624}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The error is then typically of the form {{math|~&amp;thinsp;exp(−''c''/ε)}} where {{math|ε}} is the expansion parameter. The error is thus beyond all orders in the expansion parameter. It is possible to improve on the superasymptotic error, e.g. by employing resummation methods such as [[Borel resummation]] to the divergent tail. Such methods are often referred to as '''hyperasymptotic approximations'''.

See [[asymptotic analysis]] and [[big O notation]] for the notation used in this article.

==Formal definition==

First we define an asymptotic scale, and then give the formal definition of an asymptotic expansion.

If &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a sequence of [[continuous function]]s on some domain, and if ''L'' is a [[limit point]] of the domain, then the sequence constitutes an '''asymptotic scale''' if for every ''n'',
&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{n+1}(x) = o(\varphi_n(x)) \  (x \rightarrow L)&lt;/math&gt;.  (''L'' may be taken to be infinity.) In other words, a sequence of functions is an asymptotic scale if each function in the sequence grows strictly slower (in the limit &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow L&lt;/math&gt;) than the preceding function.

If ''f'' is a continuous function on the domain of the asymptotic scale, then ''f'' has an asymptotic expansion of order ''N'' with respect to the scale as a formal series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^N a_n \varphi_{n}(x)&lt;/math&gt; if
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) - \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} a_n \varphi_{n}(x) = O(\varphi_{N}(x)) \  (x \rightarrow L)&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) - \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} a_n \varphi_{n}(x) = o(\varphi_{N-1}(x)) \  (x \rightarrow L).&lt;/math&gt;
If one or the other holds for all ''N'', then we write{{cn|date=November 2017}}
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) \sim \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n \varphi_n(x)  \  (x \rightarrow L).&lt;/math&gt;

In contrast to a convergent series for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, wherein the series converges for any ''fixed'' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the limit &lt;math&gt;N \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;, one can think of the asymptotic series as converging for ''fixed'' &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; in the limit &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow L&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; possibly infinite).

The horizontal axis is the number of terms in the asymptotic expansion. Blue points are for x=2 and red points are for x=3. It can be seen that the least error is encountered when there are 14 terms for x=2, and 20 terms for x=3, beyond which the error diverges.]]

where {{math|(2''n''&amp;thinsp;−&amp;thinsp;1)!!}} is the [[double factorial]].

Asymptotic expansions often occur when an ordinary series is used in a formal expression that forces the taking of values outside of its [[domain of convergence]]. Thus, for example, one may start with the ordinary series

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-w}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty w^n.&lt;/math&gt;

The expression on the left is valid on the entire [[complex plane]] &lt;math&gt;w\ne 1&lt;/math&gt;, while the right hand side converges only for &lt;math&gt;|w|&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. Multiplying by &lt;math&gt;e^{-w/t}&lt;/math&gt; and integrating both sides yields

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-w/t}}{1-w}\, dw 
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty t^{n+1} \int_0^\infty e^{-u} u^n\, du,&lt;/math&gt;

after the substitution &lt;math&gt;u=w/t&lt;/math&gt; on the right hand side.  The integral on the left hand side, understood as a [[Cauchy principal value]], can be expressed in terms of the [[exponential integral]].  The integral on the right hand side may be recognized as the [[gamma function]]. Evaluating both, one obtains the asymptotic expansion

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-1/t} \operatorname{Ei}\left(\frac{1}{t}\right) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty n! \; t^{n+1}. &lt;/math&gt;

Here, the right hand side is clearly not convergent for any non-zero value of ''t''. However, by truncating the series on the right to a finite number of terms, one may obtain a fairly good approximation to the value of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ei}(1/t)&lt;/math&gt; for sufficiently small ''t''. Substituting &lt;math&gt;x=-1/t&lt;/math&gt; and noting that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ei}(x)=-E_1(-x)&lt;/math&gt; results in the asymptotic expansion given earlier in this article.

==Properties==
===Uniqueness for a given asymptotic scale===
For a given asymptotic scale &lt;math&gt;\{\varphi_n(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; the asymptotic expansion of function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is unique.&lt;ref name="Malham"&gt;S.J.A. Malham, "[http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~simonm/ae.pdf An introduction to asymptotic analysis]", [[Heriot-Watt University]].&lt;/ref&gt;
That is: the coefficients &lt;math&gt;\{a_n\}&lt;/math&gt; are uniquely determined in the following way:

&lt;math&gt;
a_0 = \lim_{x \to L} \frac{f(x)}{\varphi_0(x)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
a_1 = \lim_{x \to L} \frac{f(x) - a_0 \varphi_0(x)} {\varphi_1(x)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\vdots
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
a_N = \lim_{x \to L} \frac {f(x) - \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} a_n \varphi_n(x)} {\varphi_N(x)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the limit point of this asymptotic expansion (may be &lt;math&gt;\pm \infty&lt;/math&gt;).

===Non-uniqueness for a given function===
A given function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; may have many asymptotic expansions (each with a different asymptotic scale).&lt;ref name="Malham"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdominance===
An asymptotic expansion may be asymptotic expansion to more than one function.&lt;ref name="Malham"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[graph theory]], a '''biconnected component''' (also known as a '''block''' or '''2-connected component''') is a maximal [[biconnected graph|biconnected]] [[glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]].  Any [[Connectivity (graph theory)#Connected graph|connected]] graph decomposes into a tree of biconnected components called the '''block-cut tree''' of the graph. The blocks are attached to each other at shared [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] called '''cut vertices''' or '''articulation points'''.  Specifically, a '''cut vertex''' is any vertex whose removal increases the number of [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected components]].

== Algorithms ==

===Linear time depth first search===
The classic [[sequential algorithm]] for computing biconnected components in a connected [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Undirected graph|undirected]] graph is due to [[John Hopcroft]] and [[Robert Tarjan]] (1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = J.| first2 = R.| last1 = Hopcroft| last2 =  Tarjan| title = Algorithm 447: efficient algorithms for graph manipulation| journal = Communications of the ACM| volume = 16| issue = 6| pages = 372–378| year = 1973| doi = 10.1145/362248.362272}}&lt;/ref&gt; It runs in [[Time complexity#Linear time|linear time]], and is based on [[depth-first search]]. This algorithm is also outlined as Problem 22-2 of [[Introduction to Algorithms]] (both 2nd and 3rd editions).

The idea is to run a depth-first search while maintaining the following information:
# the depth of each vertex in the depth-first-search tree (once it gets visited), and
# for each vertex ''v'', the lowest depth of neighbors of all descendants of ''v'' (including ''v'' itself) in the depth-first-search tree, called the '''lowpoint'''.
The depth is standard to maintain during a depth-first search.  The lowpoint of ''v'' can be computed after visiting all descendants of ''v'' (i.e., just before ''v'' gets popped off the depth-first-search [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]]) as the minimum of the depth of ''v'', the depth of all neighbors of ''v'' (other than the parent of ''v'' in the depth-first-search tree) and the lowpoint of all children of ''v'' in the depth-first-search tree.

The key fact is that a nonroot vertex ''v'' is a cut vertex (or articulation point) separating two biconnected components if and only if there is a child ''y'' of ''v'' such that lowpoint(''y'') ≥ depth(''v''). This property can be tested once the depth-first search returned from every child of ''v'' (i.e., just before ''v'' gets popped off the depth-first-search stack), and if true, ''v'' separates the graph into different biconnected components. This can be represented by computing one biconnected component out of every such ''y'' (a component which contains ''y'' will contain the subtree of ''y'', plus ''v''), and then erasing the subtree of ''y'' from the tree.

The root vertex must be handled separately: it is a cut vertex if and only if it has at least two children.  Thus, it suffices to simply build one component out of each child subtree of the root (including the root).

===Pseudocode===

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
GetArticulationPoints(i, d)
    visited[i] = true
    depth[i] = d
    low[i] = d
    childCount = 0
    isArticulation = false
    for each ni in adj[i]
        if not visited[ni]
            parent[ni] = i
            GetArticulationPoints(ni, d + 1)
            childCount = childCount + 1
            if low[ni] &gt;= depth[i]
                isArticulation = true
            low[i] = Min(low[i], low[ni])
        else if ni &lt;&gt; parent[i]
            low[i] = Min(low[i], depth[ni])
    if (parent[i] &lt;&gt; null and isArticulation) or (parent[i] == null and childCount &gt; 1)
        Output i as articulation point
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Note that the terms child and parent denote the relations in the DFS tree, not the original graph.

&lt;div&gt;[[File:TarjanAPDemoDepth.gif|400px|thumb|A demo of Tarjan's algorithm to find cut vertices. '''D''' denotes depth and '''L''' denotes lowpoint.]]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

=== Other algorithms ===
A simple alternative to the above algorithm uses [[chain decomposition]]s, which are special ear decompositions depending on [[depth-first search|DFS]]-trees.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{citation

Let ''C'' be a chain decomposition of ''G''. Then ''G'' is 2-vertex-connected if and only if ''G'' has minimum [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] 2 and ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the only [[Cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] in ''C''. This gives immediately a linear-time 2-connectivity test and can be extended to list all cut vertices of ''G'' in linear time using the following statement: A vertex ''v'' in a connected graph ''G'' (with minimum degree 2) is a cut vertex if and only if ''v'' is incident to a [[Bridge (graph theory)|bridge]] or ''v'' is the first vertex of a cycle in ''C - C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''. The list of cut vertices can be used to create the [[block-cut tree]] of ''G'' in linear time.

In the [[online algorithm|online]] version of the problem, vertices and edges are added (but not removed) dynamically, and a data structure must maintain the biconnected components.  [[Jeffery Westbrook]] and [[Robert Tarjan]] (1992) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = J.| first2 = R. E.| title = Maintaining bridge-connected and biconnected components on-line| last1 = Westbrook| journal = Algorithmica| volume = 7| pages = 433–464| year = 1992| doi = 10.1007/BF01758773| last2 =  Tarjan}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an efficient data structure for this problem based on [[disjoint-set data structure]]s.  Specifically, it processes ''n'' vertex additions and ''m'' edge additions in O(''m''&amp;nbsp;''&amp;alpha;''(''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'')) total time, where α is the [[inverse Ackermann function]].  This time bound is proved to be optimal.

Speedups exceeding 30 based on the original Tarjan-Vishkin algorithm were reported by James A. Edwards and [[Uzi Vishkin]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Edwards | first1 = J.

==Related structures==

=== Equivalence relation ===
One can define a [[binary relation]] on the edges of an arbitrary undirected graph, according to which two edges ''e'' and ''f'' are related if and only if either ''e''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f'' or the graph contains a [[simple cycle]] through both ''e'' and ''f''. Every edge is related to itself, and an edge ''e'' is related to another edge ''f'' if and only if ''f'' is related in the same way to ''e''. Less obviously, this is a [[transitive relation]]: if there exists a simple cycle containing edges ''e'' and ''f'', and another simple cycle containing edges ''f'' and ''g'', then one can combine these two cycles to find a simple cycle through ''e'' and ''g''. Therefore, this is an [[equivalence relation]], and it can be used to partition the edges into equivalence classes, subsets of edges with the property that two edges are related to each other if and only if they belong to the same equivalence class. The subgraphs formed by the edges in each equivalence class are the biconnected components of the given graph. Thus, the biconnected components partition the edges of the graph; however, they may share vertices with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Tarjan|Vishkin|1985}} credit the definition of this equivalence relation to {{harvtxt|Harary|1969}}; however, Harary does not appear to describe it in explicit terms.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Block graph===
The '''block graph''' of a given graph ''G'' is the [[intersection graph]] of its blocks. Thus, it has one vertex for each block of ''G'', and an edge between two vertices whenever the corresponding two blocks share a vertex.
A graph ''H'' is the block graph of another graph ''G'' exactly when all the blocks of ''H'' are complete subgraphs. The graphs ''H'' with this property are known as the [[block graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Frank|last=Harary|authorlink=Frank Harary|title=Graph Theory|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1969|page=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Block-cut tree===
A '''cutpoint''', '''cut vertex''', or '''articulation point''' of a graph ''G'' is a vertex that is shared by two or more blocks. The structure of the blocks and cutpoints of a connected graph can be described by a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] called the '''block-cut tree''' or '''BC-tree'''. This tree has a vertex for each block and for each articulation point of the given graph. There is an edge in the block-cut tree for each pair of a block and an articulation point that belongs to that block.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harary|1969}}, p.&amp;nbsp;36.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Block-cut tree2.svg|800px|thumb|none|A graph, and its block-cut tree.&lt;br/&gt;The blocks are: b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=[1,2], b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=[2,3,4], b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=[2,5,6,7], b&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;=[7,8,9,10,11], b&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;=[8,12,13,14,15], b&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;=[10,16] and b&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;=[10,17,18];&lt;br/&gt;cutpoints are: c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=2, c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=7, c&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=8 and c&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;=10.]]

is an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]]. Berndt attended college at [[Albion College]], graduating in 1961, where he also ran track. He received his master's and [[doctorate|doctoral]] degrees from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. He lectured for a year at the [[University of Glasgow]] and then, in 1967, was appointed an assistant professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], where he has remained since. In 1973–74 he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/4033 Berndt, Bruce Carl | Institute for Advanced Study]&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently ({{As of|2006|lc=on}}) [[Michio Suzuki]] Distinguished Research Professor of Mathematics at the University of Illinois.

'''Charlotte Cynthia Barnum''' (May 17, 1860 – March 27, 1934), mathematician and social activist, was the first woman to receive a [[Ph.D]] in [[mathematics]] from [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name="Green and LaDuke pp. 136-137"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.de/books?id=IRbOAwAAQBAJ | isbn=978-0-8218-4376-5 | first1 = Judy | last1 = Green | author1-link = Judy Green (mathematician) | first2 = Jeanne | last2 = LaDuke | author2-link = Jeanne LaDuke | title=Pioneering Women in American Mathematics &amp;mdash; The Pre-1940 PhD's | location= | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]], The [[London Mathematical Society]] | series=History of Mathematics | volume=34 | year = 2009 | pages=136–137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==

Charlotte Barnum was born in [[Phillipston, Massachusetts]], the third of four children of the Reverend [[Samuel Weed Barnum]] (1820–1891) and Charlotte Betts (1823–1899). Education was important in her family: two uncles had received medical degrees from Yale and her father had graduated from there with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and a [[Bachelor of Divinity]]. Her brothers Samuel and Thomas would both graduate from Yale, and her sister Clara would attend Yale graduate school after graduating from Vassar.&lt;ref name="Green and LaDuke SUPP pp. 136-137"&gt;Judy Green and Jeanne LaDuke, “Supplementary Material for Pioneering Women in American Mathematics: The Pre-1940 PhD’s,” 473–477 http://www.ams.org/publications/authors/books/postpub/hmath-34-PioneeringWomen.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from Hillhouse High School in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] Charlotte attended [[Vassar College]], where she graduated in 1881. From 1881 to 1886 she taught at a boys’ preparatory school, Betts Academy, in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] and at Hillhouse High School. She also did computing work for the [[Yale Observatory]] 1883–1885 and worked on a revision of [[James Dwight Dana]]’s ''System of Mineralogy''. Charlotte was an editorial writer for [[Webster's International Dictionary]] from 1886 to 1890, and then taught astronomy at [[Smith College]] for the academic year 1889–90.

In 1890 Charlotte applied for graduate studies at [[Johns Hopkins University]], but was turned down because they did not accept women. She persisted and with the support of [[Simon Newcomb]], professor of mathematics and astronomy at the university, she won approval to attend lectures without enrollment and without charge. Two years later, she moved to New Haven to pursue her graduate studies at Yale. In 1895 she was the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics from that institution. Her thesis was titled "Functions Having Lines or Surfaces of Discontinuity". The identity of her adviser is unclear from the record.&lt;ref name="Green and LaDuke SUPP pp. 136-137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agnesscott"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/barnum.htm|title=Charlotte Barnum|work=Biographies of Women Mathematicians|publisher=[[Agnes Scott College]]|first=Larry|last=Riddle|year=2010|accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later career ==

After receiving her Ph.D., Charlotte Barnum taught at [[Carleton College]] in [[Northfield, Minnesota]] for one year. She then left academia, and did civilian and governmental applied mathematics and editorial work the remainder of her career.

In 1898 she joined the [[American Academy of Actuaries]] and until 1901 worked as an actuarial computer for the [[Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company]], [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] and the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Company in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

In 1901 she moved to [[Washington D.C.]] to work as a computer for [[US Naval Observatory]]. She subsequently did the same work for the tidal division of the [[US Coast and Geodetic Survey]] until 1908 and then was editorial assistant in the biological survey section of the [[US Department of Agriculture]] through 1913.

She left government employment and returned to New Haven in 1914 where she did editorial work for Yale Peruvian Expeditions, the Yale University secretary’s office, and the [[Yale University Press]].

Starting in 1917 she worked in various organizations and academic institutions in Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts as an editor, actuary and teacher. All her life she was involved in social and charitable organizations and activities. In 1934 she died in [[Middletown, Connecticut]] of meningitis at the age of seventy-three.&lt;ref name="Green and LaDuke SUPP pp. 136-137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agnesscott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yale Obituary"&gt;“Charlotte Cynthia Barnum, Ph.D., 1895.” (Yale Obituary Record 1933 – 1934) pp. 204–205. http://digital.library.yale.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/1004_8/id/12679/rec/4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonard1914"/&gt;

In [[geometry]], '''Clifford's theorems''', named after the English geometer [[William Kingdon Clifford]], are a sequence of theorems relating to intersections of [[circle]]s.

== Statement of the theorem ==

The first theorem considers any four circles passing through a common point ''M'' and otherwise in [[general position]], meaning that there are six additional points where exactly two of the circles cross and that no three of these crossing points are collinear.  Every set of three of these four circles has among them three crossing points, and (by the assumption of non-collinearity) there exists a circle passing through these three crossing points. The conclusion is that, like the first set of four circles, the second set of four circles defined in this way all pass through a single point&amp;nbsp;''P'' (in general not the same point as ''M'').

The second theorem considers five circles in general position passing through a single point ''M''.  Each subset of four circles defines a new point ''P'' according to the first theorem.  Then these five points all lie on a single circle&amp;nbsp;''C''.

The third theorem consider six circles in general position that pass through a single point ''M''.  Each subset of five circles defines a new circle by the second theorem.  Then these six new circles ''C'' all pass through a single point.

The sequence of theorems can be continued indefinitely.

{{refimprove|date=June 2014}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''closed-form expression''' is a [[expression (mathematics)|mathematical expression]] that can be evaluated in a [[finite set|finite]] number of operations. It may contain [[Constant (mathematics)|constants]], [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], certain "well-known" [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]] (e.g., + − × ÷), and [[function (mathematics)|function]]s (e.g., [[Nth root|''n''th root]], [[exponent]], [[logarithm]], [[trigonometric functions]], and [[inverse hyperbolic functions]]), but usually no [[limit of a sequence|limit]]. The set of operations and functions admitted in a closed-form expression may vary with author and context.

== Example: roots of polynomials ==

The solutions of any [[quadratic equation]] with [[complex number|complex]] [[coefficients]] can be expressed in closed form in terms of [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], [[Division (mathematics)|division]], and [[square root]] extraction, each of which is an [[elementary function]]. For example, the quadratic equation

:&lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c=0,&lt;/math&gt;

is tractable since its solutions can be expressed as closed-form expression, i.e. in terms of elementary functions:

:&lt;math&gt;x={-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly solutions of cubic and quartic (third and fourth degree) equations can be expressed using arithmetic, square roots, and [[cube root]]s, or alternatively using arithmetic and trigonometric functions. However, there are [[quintic equation]]s without closed-form solutions using elementary functions, such as ''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

An area of study in mathematics referred to broadly as [[Galois theory]] involves proving that no closed-form expression exists in certain contexts, based on the central example of closed-form solutions to polynomials.

== Alternative definitions ==

Changing the definition of "well-known" to include additional functions can change the set of equations with closed-form solutions.  Many [[cumulative distribution function]]s cannot be expressed in closed form, unless one considers [[special functions]] such as the [[error function]] or [[gamma function]] to be well known.  It is possible to solve the quintic equation if general [[hypergeometric function]]s are included, although the solution is far too complicated algebraically to be useful.  For many practical computer applications, it is entirely reasonable to assume that the gamma function and other special functions are well-known since numerical implementations are widely available.

== Analytic expression ==

An '''analytic expression''' (or '''expression in analytic form''') is a [[mathematical expression]] constructed using well-known operations that lend themselves readily to calculation. Similar to closed-form expressions, the set of well-known functions allowed can vary according to context but always includes the [[Arithmetic#Arithmetic operations|basic arithmetic operations]] (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), exponentiation to a real exponent (which includes extraction of the [[nth root|{{math|''n''}}th root]]), logarithms, and trigonometric functions.

However, the class of expressions considered to be analytic expressions tends to be wider than that for closed-form expressions. In particular, [[special functions]] such as the [[Bessel functions]] and the [[gamma function]] are usually allowed, and often so are [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]] and [[continued fraction]]s. On the other hand, [[Limit of a sequence|limits]] in general, and [[integral]]s in particular, are typically excluded.{{cn|reason=This paragraph seems [[WP:OR]]. In particular, here, the distinction between series and limits is completely irrelevant.|date=June 2018}}

If an analytic expression involves only the algebraic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation to a rational exponent) and rational constants then it is more specifically referred to as an [[algebraic expression]].

==&lt;span id="Closed-form_vs._analytical_expressions"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Comparison of different classes of expressions ==

Closed-form expressions are an important sub-class of analytic expressions, which contain a bounded{{citation needed|reason=This would make the sub-class non-closed e.g. wrt. addition: if e.g. up to one application of 'sin' is allowed, both 'sin(x)' and 'sin(y)' would be a member, but their sum would not. I wonder if any author can be found for this.|date=October 2014}} or an unbounded number of applications of well-known functions. Unlike the broader analytic expressions, the closed-form expressions do not include [[Series (mathematics)#Infinite series|infinite series]] or [[continued fraction]]s; neither includes [[integral]]s or [[limit of a sequence|limits]]. Indeed, by the [[Stone–Weierstrass theorem]], any [[continuous function]] on the [[unit interval]] can be expressed as a limit of polynomials, so any class of functions containing the polynomials and closed under limits will necessarily include all continuous functions.

Similarly,  an [[equation]] or [[system of equations]] is said to have a '''closed-form solution''' if, and only if, at least one [[equation solving|solution]] can be expressed as a closed-form expression; and it is said to have an '''analytic solution''' if and only if at least one solution can be expressed as an analytic expression. There is a subtle distinction between a "closed-form ''function''" and a "[[#Closed-form number|closed-form ''number'']]" in the discussion of a "closed-form solution", discussed in {{Harv|Chow|1999}} and [[#Closed-form number|below]]. A closed-form or analytic solution is sometimes referred to as an '''explicit solution'''.

== Dealing with non-closed-form expressions ==

=== Transformation into closed-form expressions ===

The expression:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty {x \over 2^i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

is not in closed form because the summation entails an infinite number of elementary operations. However, by summing a geometric series this expression can be expressed in the closed-form:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holton|first=Glyn|title=Numerical Solution, Closed-Form Solution|url=http://www.riskglossary.com/link/closed_form_solution.htm|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(x) = 2x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Differential Galois theory ===
{{main article|Differential Galois theory}}

The integral of a closed-form expression may or may not itself be expressible as a closed-form expression. This study is referred to as [[differential Galois theory]], by analogy with algebraic Galois theory.

The basic theorem of differential Galois theory is due to [[Joseph Liouville]] in the 1830s and 1840s and hence referred to as '''[[Liouville's theorem (differential algebra)|Liouville's theorem]]'''.

A standard example of an elementary function whose antiderivative does not have a closed-form expression is:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;e^{-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

whose antiderivative is (up to constants) the [[error function]]:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{erf}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{0}^x e^{-t^2}\,\mathrm dt.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Mathematical modelling and computer simulation ===

Equations or systems too complex for closed-form or analytic solutions can often be analysed by [[mathematical model]]ling and [[computer simulation]].

== Closed-form number ==
{{see also|Transcendental number theory}}

Three subfields of the complex numbers '''C''' have been suggested as encoding the notion of a "closed-form number"; in increasing order of generality, these are the [[Liouville number (closed form expression)|Liouville numbers]], [[EL number]]s and [[elementary number]]s. The '''Liouville numbers''', denoted '''L''' (not to be confused with [[Liouville number]]s in the sense of rational approximation), form the smallest ''[[algebraically closed]]'' subfield of '''C''' closed under exponentiation and logarithm (formally, intersection of all such subfields)—that is, numbers which involve ''explicit'' exponentiation and logarithms, but allow explicit and ''implicit'' polynomials (roots of polynomials); this is defined in {{Harv|Ritt|1948|loc=p. 60}}. '''L''' was originally referred to as '''elementary numbers''', but this term is now used more broadly to refer to numbers defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of algebraic operations, exponentials, and logarithms. A narrower definition proposed in {{Harv|Chow|1999|loc=pp. 441–442}}, denoted '''E''', and referred to as '''EL numbers''', is the smallest subfield of '''C''' closed under exponentiation and logarithm—this need not be algebraically closed, and correspond to ''explicit'' algebraic, exponential, and logarithmic operations. "EL" stands both for "Exponential-Logarithmic" and as an abbreviation for "elementary".

Whether a number is a closed-form number is related to whether a number is [[transcendental number|transcendental]]. Formally, Liouville numbers and elementary numbers contain the [[algebraic number]]s, and they include some but not all transcendental numbers. In contrast, EL numbers do not contain all algebraic numbers, but do include some transcendental numbers. Closed-form numbers can be studied via [[transcendental number theory]], in which a major result is the [[Gelfond–Schneider theorem]], and a major open question is [[Schanuel's conjecture]].

== Numerical computations ==

For purposes of numeric computations, being in closed form is not in general necessary, as many limits and integrals can be efficiently computed.

== Conversion from numerical forms ==

There is software that attempts to find closed-form expressions for numerical values, including RIES,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Munafo |first = Robert |title = RIES - Find Algebraic Equations, Given Their Solution |url = http://mrob.com/pub/ries/index.html |accessdate = 30 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;tt&gt;identify&lt;/tt&gt; in [[Maple (software)|Maple]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = identify |url = http://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/Maple/view.aspx?path=identify |work = Maple Online Help |publisher = Maplesoft |accessdate = 30 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SymPy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Number identification |url = http://docs.sympy.org/0.7.1/modules/mpmath/identification.html |work = SymPy documentation }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plouffe's Inverter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Plouffe's Inverter |url = http://pi.lacim.uqam.ca/eng/server_en.html |accessdate = 30 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Inverse Symbolic Calculator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Inverse Symbolic Calculator |url = http://oldweb.cecm.sfu.ca/projects/ISC/ |accessdate = 30 April 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120329145758/http://oldweb.cecm.sfu.ca/projects/ISC/ |archivedate = 29 March 2012 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2724">In [[algebraic topology]], a '''complex-orientable cohomology theory''' is a [[multiplicative cohomology theory]] ''E'' such that the restriction map &lt;math&gt;E^2(\mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^\infty) \to E^2(\mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^1)&lt;/math&gt; is surjective. An element of &lt;math&gt;E^2(\mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^\infty)&lt;/math&gt; that restricts to the canonical generator of the reduced theory &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{E}^2(\mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^1)&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''complex orientation'''. The notion is central to Quillen's work relating cohomology to [[formal group law]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;!-- a bit vague --&gt;

If E is an even-graded theory meaning &lt;math&gt;\pi_3 E = \pi_5 E = \cdots&lt;/math&gt;, then ''E'' is complex-orientable. This follows from the [[Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence]]. 

Examples:
*An ordinary cohomology with any coefficient ring ''R'' is complex orientable, as &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{H}^2(\mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^\infty; R) \simeq \operatorname{H}^2(\mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^1;R)&lt;/math&gt;.
*Complex ''K''-theory, denoted ''KU'', is complex-orientable, as it is even-graded. ([[Bott periodicity theorem]])
*[[Complex cobordism]], whose spectrum is denoted by MU, is complex-orientable.

A complex orientation, call it ''t'', gives rise to a formal group law as follows: let ''m'' be the multiplication
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^\infty \times \mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^\infty \to \mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^\infty, ([x], [y]) \mapsto [xy]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;[x]&lt;/math&gt; denotes a line passing through ''x'' in the underlying vector space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}[t]&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;.  This is the map classifying the tensor product of the universal line bundle over &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^\infty &lt;/math&gt;. Viewing
:&lt;math&gt;E^*(\mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^\infty) = \varprojlim E^*(\mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^n) = \varprojlim R[t]/(t^{n+1}) = R[\![t]\!], \quad R =\pi_* E &lt;/math&gt;,
let &lt;math&gt;f = m^*(t)&lt;/math&gt; be the pullback of ''t'' along ''m''. It lives in
:&lt;math&gt;E^*(\mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^\infty \times \mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^\infty) = \varprojlim E^*(\mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^n \times \mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^m) = \varprojlim R[x,y]/(x^{n+1},y^{m+1}) = R[\![x, y]\!]&lt;/math&gt;
and one can show, using properties of the tensor product of line bundles, it is a formal group law (e.g., satisfies associativity).

'''Complexity''' characterises the behaviour of a [[system]] or [[model (disambiguation)|model]] whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions.&lt;ref name="steven"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is generally used to characterize something with many parts where those parts interact with each other in multiple ways, culminating in a higher order of [[emergence]] greater than the sum of its parts. The study of these complex linkages at various scales is the main goal of [[complex systems theory]].

[[Science]] {{as of | 2010 | lc = on}} takes a number of approaches to characterizing complexity; Zayed ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;
J. M. Zayed, N. Nouvel, U. Rauwald, O. A. Scherman. ''Chemical Complexity – supramolecular self-assembly of synthetic and biological building blocks in water''. Chemical Society Reviews, 2010, 39, 2806–2816 http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2010/CS/b922348g
&lt;/ref&gt;
reflect many of these. [[Neil F. Johnson|Neil Johnson]] states that "even among scientists, there is no unique definition of complexity – and the scientific notion has traditionally been conveyed using particular examples..."  Ultimately Johnson adopts the definition of "complexity science" as "the study of the phenomena which emerge from a collection of interacting objects".&lt;ref name="Neil Johnson"&gt;{{cite book

== Overview ==
Definitions of complexity often depend on the concept of a confidential "[[system]]" – a set of parts or elements that have relationships among them differentiated from relationships with other elements outside the relational regime. Many definitions tend to postulate or assume that complexity expresses a condition of numerous elements in a system and numerous forms of relationships among the elements. However, what one sees as complex and what one sees as simple is relative and changes with time.

[[Warren Weaver]] posited in 1948 two forms of complexity: disorganized complexity, and organized complexity.&lt;ref name=Weaver&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
Phenomena of 'disorganized complexity' are treated using probability theory and statistical mechanics, while 'organized complexity' deals with phenomena that escape such approaches and confront "dealing simultaneously with a sizable number of factors which are interrelated into an organic whole".&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt; Weaver's 1948 paper has influenced subsequent thinking about complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The approaches that embody concepts of systems, multiple elements, multiple relational regimes, and state spaces might be summarized as implying that complexity arises from the number of distinguishable relational regimes (and their associated state spaces) in a defined system.

Some definitions relate to the algorithmic basis for the expression of a complex phenomenon or model or mathematical expression, as later set out herein.

== Disorganized vs. organized ==
One of the problems in addressing complexity issues has been formalizing the intuitive conceptual distinction between the large number of variances in relationships extant in random collections, and the sometimes large, but smaller, number of relationships between elements in systems where constraints (related to correlation of otherwise independent elements) simultaneously reduce the variations from element independence and create distinguishable regimes of more-uniform, or correlated, relationships, or interactions.

Weaver perceived and addressed this problem, in at least a preliminary way, in drawing a distinction between "disorganized complexity" and "organized complexity".

In Weaver's view, disorganized complexity results from the particular system having a very large number of parts, say millions of parts, or many more. Though the interactions of the parts in a "disorganized complexity" situation can be seen as largely random, the properties of the system as a whole can be understood by using probability and statistical methods.

A prime example of disorganized complexity is a gas in a container, with the gas molecules as the parts. Some would suggest that a system of disorganized complexity may be compared with the (relative) [[simplicity]] of planetary orbits – the latter can be predicted by applying [[Newton's laws of motion]]. Of course, most real-world systems, including planetary orbits, eventually become theoretically unpredictable even using Newtonian dynamics; as discovered by modern [[chaos theory]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sir James Lighthill and Modern Fluid Mechanics", by Lokenath Debnath, The University of Texas-Pan American, US, Imperial College Press: {{ISBN|978-1-84816-113-9}}: {{ISBN|1-84816-113-1}}, Singapore, page 31. Online at http://cs5594.userapi.com/u11728334/docs/25eb2e1350a5/Lokenath_Debnath_Sir_James_Lighthill_and_mode.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized complexity, in Weaver's view, resides in nothing else than the non-random, or correlated, interaction between the parts. These correlated relationships create a differentiated structure that can, as a system, interact with other systems. The coordinated system manifests properties not carried or dictated by individual parts. The organized aspect of this form of complexity vis-a-vis to other systems than the subject system can be said to "emerge," without any "guiding hand".

The number of parts does not have to be very large for a particular system to have emergent properties. A system of organized complexity may be understood in its properties (behavior among the properties) through [[model (abstract)|modeling]] and [[simulation]], particularly [[computer simulation|modeling and simulation with computers]]. An example of organized complexity is a city neighborhood as a living mechanism, with the neighborhood people among the system's parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Sources and factors ==
There are generally rules which can be invoked to explain the origin of complexity in a given system.

The source of disorganized complexity is the large number of parts in the system of interest, and the lack of correlation between elements in the system.

In the case of self-organizing living systems, usefully organized complexity comes from beneficially mutated organisms being selected to survive by their environment for their differential reproductive ability or at least success over inanimate matter or less organized complex organisms. See e.g. [[Robert Ulanowicz]]'s treatment of ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Ulanowicz, Robert, "Ecology, the Ascendant Perspective", Columbia, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Complexity of an object or system is a relative property. For instance, for many functions (problems), such a computational complexity as time of computation is smaller when multitape [[Turing machine]]s are used than when Turing machines with one tape are used. [[Random Access Machine]]s allow one to even more decrease time complexity (Greenlaw and Hoover 1998: 226), while inductive Turing machines can decrease even the complexity class of a function, language or set (Burgin 2005). This shows that tools of activity can be an important factor of complexity.

== Varied meanings ==
In several scientific fields, "complexity" has a precise meaning:

* In [[computational complexity theory]], the [[Computational resource|amounts of resources]] required for the execution of [[algorithm]]s is studied. The most popular types of computational complexity are the time complexity of a problem equal to the number of steps that it takes to solve an instance of the problem as a function of the [[problem size|size of the input]] (usually measured in bits), using the most efficient algorithm, and the space complexity of a problem equal to the volume of the [[computer storage|memory]] used by the algorithm (e.g., cells of the tape) that it takes to solve an instance of the problem as a function of the size of the input (usually measured in bits), using the most efficient algorithm. This allows classification of computational problems by [[complexity class]] (such as [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP,]] etc.). An axiomatic approach to computational complexity was developed by [[Manuel Blum]]. It allows one to deduce many properties of concrete computational complexity measures, such as time complexity or space complexity, from properties of axiomatically defined measures.
* In [[algorithmic information theory]], the ''[[Kolmogorov complexity]]'' (also called ''descriptive complexity'', ''algorithmic complexity'' or ''algorithmic entropy'') of a [[string (computer science)|string]] is the length of the shortest binary [[computer program|program]] that outputs that string. [[Minimum message length]] is a practical application of this approach. Different kinds of Kolmogorov complexity are studied: the uniform complexity, prefix complexity, monotone complexity, time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, and space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. An axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity based on [[Blum axioms]] (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in the paper presented for publication by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]].&lt;ref&gt;Burgin, M. (1982) Generalized Kolmogorov complexity and duality in theory of computations, Notices of the Russian Academy of Sciences, v.25, No. 3, pp. 19–23&lt;/ref&gt; The axiomatic approach encompasses other approaches to Kolmogorov complexity. It is possible to treat different kinds of Kolmogorov complexity as particular cases of axiomatically defined generalized Kolmogorov complexity. Instead of proving similar theorems, such as the basic invariance theorem, for each particular measure, it is possible to easily deduce all such results from one corresponding theorem proved in the axiomatic setting. This is a general advantage of the axiomatic approach in mathematics. The axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity was further developed in the book (Burgin 2005) and applied to software metrics (Burgin and Debnath, 2003; Debnath and Burgin, 2003).
* In [[information processing]], complexity is a measure of the total number of [[property|properties]] transmitted by an object and detected by an [[observation|observer]]. Such a collection of properties is often referred to as a [[state (computer science)|state]].
* In [[physical systems]], complexity is a measure of the [[probability]] of the [[Quantum state|state vector]] of the system. This should not be confused with [[entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|entropy]]; it is a distinct mathematical measure, one in which two distinct states are never conflated and considered equal, as is done for the notion of entropy in [[statistical mechanics]].
* In [[mathematics]], [[Krohn–Rhodes complexity]] is an important topic in the study of finite [[semigroup]]s and [[automata theory|automata]].
* In [[Network theory]] complexity is the product of richness in the connections between components of a system,&lt;ref&gt;A complex network analysis example: "[http://www.martingrandjean.ch/complex-structures-and-international-organizations/ Complex Structures and International Organizations]" ({{Cite journal | volume = | issue = 2| last = Grandjean| first = Martin| title = Analisi e visualizzazioni delle reti in storia. L'esempio della cooperazione intellettuale della Società delle Nazioni | journal = Memoria e Ricerca | date = 2017| pages = 371–393| url = https://www.rivisteweb.it/doi/10.14647/87204 | doi = 10.14647/87204}} See also: [https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01610098v2 French version]).&lt;/ref&gt; and defined by a very unequal distribution of certain measures (some elements being highly connected and some very few, see [[complex network]]). 
* In [[software engineering]], [[programming complexity]] is a measure of the interactions of the various elements of the software. This differs from the computational complexity described above in that it is a measure of the design of the software.
* In [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]] sense – Abstract Complexity, is based on visual structures [[perception]] &lt;ref&gt;Mariusz Stanowski (2011) Abstract Complexity Definition, Complicity 2, p.78-83 [https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/complicity/article/view/11156]&lt;/ref&gt; It is complexity of binary string defined as a square of features number divided by number of elements (0's and 1's). Features comprise here all distinctive arrangements of 0's and 1's. Though the features number have to be always approximated the definition is precise and meet intuitive criterion.

Other fields introduce less precisely defined notions of complexity:

* A [[complex adaptive system]] has some or all of the following attributes:&lt;ref name="Neil Johnson" /&gt;
** The number of parts (and types of parts) in the system and the number of relations between the parts is non-trivial – however, there is no general rule to separate "trivial" from "non-trivial";
** The system has memory or includes [[feedback]];
** The system can adapt itself according to its history or feedback;
** The relations between the system and its environment are non-trivial or non-linear;
** The system can be influenced by, or can adapt itself to, its environment;
** The system is highly sensitive to initial conditions.

== Study ==
Complexity has always been a part of our environment, and therefore many scientific fields have dealt with complex systems and phenomena. From one perspective, that which is somehow complex – displaying variation without being [[randomness|random]] – is most worthy of interest given the rewards found in the depths of exploration.

The use of the term complex is often confused with the term complicated. In today's systems, this is the difference between myriad connecting "stovepipes" and effective "integrated" solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lissack, Michael R.]]; [[Johan Roos]] (2000). ''The Next Common Sense, The e-Manager's Guide to Mastering Complexity.'' Intercultural Press. {{ISBN|978-1-85788-235-3}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; This means that complex is the opposite of independent, while complicated is the opposite of simple.

While this has led some fields to come up with specific definitions of complexity, there is a more recent movement to regroup observations [[interdisciplinarity|from different fields]] to study complexity in itself, whether it appears in [[anthill]]s, [[human brain]]s, or [[stock market]]s, social systems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/30193748/Complexics_as_a_Meta-Transdisciplinary_Field|title=Complexics as a meta-transdisciplinary field|last=Bastardas-Boada|first=Albert|date=|website=Academia.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One such interdisciplinary group of fields is [[relational order theories]].

== Topics ==

=== Behaviour ===
The behavior of a complex system is often said to be due to emergence and [[self-organization]]. Chaos theory has investigated the sensitivity of systems to variations in initial conditions as one cause of complex behaviour.

===Mechanisms ===
Recent developments around [[artificial life]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithm]]s have led to an increasing emphasis on complexity and [[complex adaptive systems]].

=== Simulations ===
In [[social science]], the study on the emergence of macro-properties from the micro-properties, also known as macro-micro view in [[sociology]]. The topic is commonly recognized as [[social complexity]] that is often related to the use of computer simulation in social science, i.e.: [[computational sociology]].

=== Systems ===
{{main article|Complex system}}
[[Systems theory]] has long been concerned with the study of [[complex system]]s (in recent times, ''complexity theory'' and ''complex systems'' have also been used as names of the field). These systems are present in the research of a variety disciplines, including [[biology]], [[economics]], social studies and [[technology]]. Recently, complexity has become a natural domain of interest of real world socio-cognitive systems and emerging [[systemics]] research. Complex systems tend to be high-[[dimension]]al, [[non-linearity|non-linear]], and difficult to model. In specific circumstances, they may exhibit low-dimensional behaviour.

=== Data ===
In [[information theory]], algorithmic information theory is concerned with the complexity of strings of data.

Complex strings are harder to compress. While intuition tells us that this may depend on the [[codec]] used to compress a string (a codec could be theoretically created in any arbitrary language, including one in which the very small command "X" could cause the computer to output a very complicated string like "18995316"), any two [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] languages can be implemented in each other, meaning that the length of two encodings in different languages will vary by at most the length of the "translation" language – which will end up being negligible for sufficiently large data strings.

These algorithmic measures of complexity tend to assign high values to [[signal noise|random noise]]. However, those studying complex systems would not consider randomness as complexity{{who|date=October 2013}}.

[[Information entropy]] is also sometimes used in information theory as indicative of complexity.

Recent work in [[machine learning]] has examined the complexity of the data as it affects the performance of [[Supervised learning|supervised]] classification algorithms. Ho and Basu present a set of [[Computational complexity theory|complexity measures]] for [[binary classification]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ho, T.K.; Basu, M. (2002). "[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=990132&amp;tag=1 Complexity Measures of Supervised Classification Problems]". IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 24 (3), pp 289–300.&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity measures broadly cover:
* the overlaps in feature values from differing classes.
* the separability of the classes.
* measures of geometry, topology, and density of [[manifold]]s. Instance hardness is another approach seeks to characterize the data complexity with the goal of determining how hard a data set is to classify correctly and is not limited to binary problems.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M.R.; Martinez, T.; Giraud-Carrier, C. (2014). "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10994-013-5422-z An Instance Level Analysis of Data Complexity]". Machine Learning, 95(2): 225–256.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Instance hardness is a bottom-up approach that first seeks to identify instances that are likely to be misclassified (or, in other words, which instances are the most complex). The characteristics of the instances that are likely to be misclassified are then measured based on the output from a set of hardness measures. The hardness measures are based on several supervised learning techniques such as measuring the number of disagreeing neighbors or the likelihood of the assigned class label given the input features. The information provided by the complexity measures has been examined for use in [[Meta learning (computer science)|meta learning]] to determine for which data sets filtering (or removing suspected noisy instances from the training set) is the most beneficial&lt;ref&gt;Saez, J.; Luengo, J.; Herrera, F. (2013). "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320312003251 Predicting Noise Filtering Efficacy with Data Complexity Measures for Nearest Neighbor Classification]". Pattern Recognition 46 (1) pp 355–364.&lt;/ref&gt; and could be expanded to other areas.

=== In molecular recognition ===
A recent study based on molecular simulations and compliance constants describes [[molecular recognition]] as a phenomenon of organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Complexity in molecular recognition | author=Jorg Grunenberg | journal=Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. | year=2011 | volume=13 | pages= 10136–10146 | doi=10.1039/c1cp20097f}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even for small molecules like [[carbohydrates]], the recognition process can not be predicted or designed even assuming that each individual [[hydrogen bond]]'s strength is exactly known.

== Applications ==
Computational complexity theory is the study of the complexity of problems – that is, the difficulty of [[problem solving|solving]] them. Problems can be classified by complexity class according to the time it takes for an algorithm – usually a computer program – to solve them as a function of the problem size. Some problems are difficult to solve, while others are easy. For example, some difficult problems need algorithms that take an exponential amount of time in terms of the size of the problem to solve. Take the [[travelling salesman problem]], for example. It can be solved in time &lt;math&gt;O(n^2 2^n)&lt;/math&gt; (where ''n'' is the size of the network to visit – the number of cities the travelling salesman must visit exactly once). As the size of the network of cities grows, the time needed to find the route grows (more than) exponentially.

Even though a problem may be computationally solvable in principle, in actual practice it may not be that simple. These problems might require large amounts of time or an inordinate amount of space. [[Analysis of algorithms|Computational complexity]] may be approached from many different aspects. Computational complexity can be investigated on the basis of time, memory or other resources used to solve the problem. Time and space are two of the most important and popular considerations when problems of complexity are analyzed.

There exist a certain class of problems that although they are solvable in principle they require so much time or space that it is not practical to attempt to solve them. These problems are called [[Computational complexity theory#Intractability|intractable]].

There is another form of complexity called [[Model of hierarchical complexity|hierarchical complexity]]. It is orthogonal to the forms of complexity discussed so far, which are called horizontal complexity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9980">[[File:Polynomialdeg3.svg|thumb|right|A differentiable function]]
In [[calculus]] (a branch of [[mathematics]]), a '''differentiable function''' of one [[Real number|real]] variable is a function whose [[derivative]] exists at each point in its [[Domain of a function|domain]]. As a result, the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of a differentiable function must have a (non-[[Vertical tangent|vertical]]) [[tangent line]] at each point in its domain, be relatively smooth, and cannot contain any breaks, bends, or [[Cusp (singularity)|cusps]].

More generally, if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a point in the domain of a function ''f'', then ''f'' is said to be ''differentiable at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' if the derivative ''f'' ′(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) exists.  This means that the graph of ''f'' has a non-vertical tangent line at the point (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)).  The function ''f'' may also be called ''locally linear'' at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, as it can be well approximated by a [[linear function]] near this point.

==Differentiability of real functions of one variable==

A function &lt;math&gt;f:U\subset\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, defined on an open set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, is said to be differentiable at &lt;math&gt;a\in U&lt;/math&gt; if any of the following equivalent conditions is satisfied:

* The derivative &lt;math&gt;f'(a)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}&lt;/math&gt; exists.
* There exists a real number &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)-Lh}{h}=0&lt;/math&gt;. The number &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, when it exists, is equal to &lt;math&gt;f'(a)&lt;/math&gt;.
* There exists a function &lt;math&gt;g:U\subset\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(a+h)=f(a)+f'(a)h+g(h)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to0}\frac{g(h)}{h}=0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Differentiability and continuity==

If {{math|''f''}} is differentiable at a point {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then {{math|''f''}} must also be [[continuous function|continuous]] at {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  In particular, any differentiable function must be continuous at every point in its domain. ''The converse does not hold'': a continuous function need not be differentiable. For example, a function with a bend, [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]], or [[vertical tangent]] may be continuous, but fails to be differentiable at the location of the anomaly.

Most functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or at [[Almost everywhere|almost every]] point. However, a result of [[Stefan Banach]] states that the set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a [[meager set]] in the space of all continuous functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Banach |first=S. |title=Über die Baire'sche Kategorie gewisser Funktionenmengen |journal=[[Studia Mathematica|Studia.

The first known example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere is the [[Weierstrass function]].

However, this function is not continuously differentiable.]]
A function ''f''  is said to be ''continuously differentiable'' if the derivative ''{{prime|f}}''(''x'') exists and is itself a continuous function. Although the derivative of a differentiable function never has a [[jump discontinuity]], it is possible for the derivative to have an essential discontinuity. For example, the function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) \;=\; \begin{cases} x^2\sin (1/x) &amp; \text{if }x \ne 0 \\ 0 &amp; \text{if }x=0\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
is differentiable at 0, since
:&lt;math&gt;f'(0)=\lim_{\epsilon\to0}\left(\frac{\epsilon^2\sin(1/\epsilon)-0}{\epsilon}\right)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
exists.  However, for ''x'' ≠ 0, [[differentiation rules]] imply
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x)=2x\sin(1/x)-\cos(1/x)&lt;/math&gt;
which has no limit as ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0. Nevertheless, [[Darboux's theorem (analysis)|Darboux's theorem]] implies that the derivative of any function satisfies the conclusion of the [[intermediate value theorem]].

Continuously differentiable functions are sometimes said to be of ''class''&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. A function is of ''class''&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; if the first and [[second derivative]] of the function both exist and are continuous. More generally, a function is said to be of ''class''&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; if the first ''k'' derivatives ''{{prime|f}}''(''x''), ''{{prime|{{prime|f}}}}''(''x''), ..., ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') all exist and are continuous. If derivatives ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt; exist for all positive integers ''n'', the function is [[smooth function|smooth]] or equivalently, of ''class''&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Differentiability in higher dimensions==
{{See also|Multivariable calculus}}

A [[function of several real variables]] {{math|'''f''': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is said to be differentiable at a point {{math|'''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''}} if [[there exists]] a [[linear map]] {{math|'''J''': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} such that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\mathbf{h}\to \mathbf{0}} \frac{\|\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x_0}+\mathbf{h}) - \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x_0}) - \mathbf{J}\mathbf{(h)}\|_{\mathbf{R}^{n}}}{\| \mathbf{h} \|_{\mathbf{R}^{m}}} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If a function is differentiable at {{math|'''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''}}, then all of the [[partial derivative]]s exist at {{math|'''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''}}, and the linear map {{math|'''J'''}} is given by the [[Jacobian matrix]]. A similar formulation of the higher-dimensional derivative is provided by the [[fundamental increment lemma]] found in single-variable calculus.

If all the partial derivatives of a function exist in a [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of a point {{math|'''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''}} and are continuous at the point {{math|'''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''}}, then the function is differentiable at that point {{math|'''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''}}.

However, the existence of the partial derivatives (or even of all the [[directional derivative]]s) does not in general guarantee that a function is differentiable at a point. For example, the function {{math|''f'': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''}} defined by

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = \begin{cases}x &amp; \text{if }y \ne x^2 \\ 0 &amp; \text{if }y = x^2\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

is not differentiable at {{math|(0, 0)}}, but all of the partial derivatives and directional derivatives exist at this point.  For a continuous example, the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = \begin{cases}y^3/(x^2+y^2) &amp; \text{if }(x,y) \ne (0,0) \\ 0 &amp; \text{if }(x,y) = (0,0)\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

is not differentiable at {{math|(0, 0)}}, but again all of the partial derivatives and directional derivatives exist.

==Differentiability in complex analysis==
{{main|Holomorphic function}}
In [[complex analysis]], complex-differentiability is defined using the same definition as single-variable real functions. This is allowed by the possibility of dividing complex numbers. So, a function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt; when

:&lt;math&gt;f'(a)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;

Although this definition looks similar to the differentiability of single-variable real functions, it is however a more restrictive condition. A function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, that is complex-differentiable at a point &lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt; is automatically differentiable at that point, when viewed as a function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;. This is because the complex-differentiability implies that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to0}\frac{|f(a+h)-f(a)-f'(a)h|}{|h|}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

However, a function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; can be differentiable as a multi-variable function, while not being complex-differentiable. For example, &lt;math&gt;f(z)=\frac{z+\overline{z}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at every point, viewed as the 2-variable real function &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=x&lt;/math&gt;, but it is not complex-differentiable at any point.

Any function that is complex-differentiable in a neighborhood of a point is called [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] at that point. Such a function is necessarily infinitely differentiable, and in fact [[Analytic function|analytic]].

==Differentiable functions on manifolds==
{{See also|Differentiable manifold#Differentiable functions}}
If ''M'' is a [[differentiable manifold]], a real or complex-valued function ''f'' on ''M'' is said to be differentiable at a point ''p'' if it is differentiable with respect to some (or any) coordinate chart defined around ''p''.  More generally, if ''M'' and ''N'' are differentiable manifolds, a function ''f'':&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''N'' is said to be differentiable at a point ''p'' if it is differentiable with respect to some (or any) coordinate charts defined around ''p'' and ''f''(''p'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2619">In mathematics, a '''generalized map''' is a [[topology|topological]] model which allows one to represent and to handle subdivided objects.  This model was defined starting from [[combinatorial map]]s in order to represent non-orientable and open subdivisions, which is not possible with combinatorial maps. The main advantage of generalized map is the homogeneity of one-to-one mappings in any dimensions, which simplifies definitions and algorithms comparing to combinatorial maps. For this reason, generalized maps are sometimes used instead of combinatorial maps, even to represent orientable closed partitions.

Like combinatorial maps, generalized maps are used as efficient data structure in image representation and processing, in geometrical modeling, they are related to [[simplicial set]] and to [[combinatorial topology]], and this is a [[boundary representation]] model (B-rep or BREP), i.e. it represents object by its boundaries.

==General definition==
The definition of generalized map in any dimension is given in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/0010-4485(91)90082-8| issn = 0010-4485| volume = 23| issue = 1| pages = 59–82| last = Lienhardt| first = Pascal| title = Topological models for boundary representation: a comparison with n-dimensional generalized maps| journal = Computer-Aided Design| date = 1991-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1142/S0218195994000173| issn = 0218-1959| volume = 04| issue = 03| pages = 275–324| last = Lienhardt| first = Pascal| title = N-DIMENSIONAL GENERALIZED COMBINATORIAL MAPS AND CELLULAR QUASI-MANIFOLDS| journal = International Journal of Computational Geometry &amp; Applications| year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''n''D generalized map (or ''n''G-map) is an (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2)-tuple ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''D'',&amp;nbsp;''α''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''α''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) such that:
* ''D'' is a finite set of darts;
* ''α''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''α''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[Involution (mathematics)|involutions]] on ''D'';
* ''α''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;o&amp;nbsp;''α''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is an involution if ''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''j'' (''i'',&amp;nbsp;''j'' ∈ {&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;,...,&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;}).

An ''n''D generalized map represents the subdivision of an open or closed orientable or not ''n''D space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7600">In [[mathematics]], specifically [[commutative algebra]], '''Hilbert's basis theorem''' says that a [[polynomial ring]] over a [[Noetherian ring]] is Noetherian.
==Statement==

If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; a ring, let &lt;math&gt;R[X]&lt;/math&gt; denote the ring of polynomials in the indeterminate &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] proved that if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is "not too large", in the sense that if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is Noetherian, the same must be true for &lt;math&gt;R[X]&lt;/math&gt;. Formally,

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Hilbert's Basis Theorem.''' If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a Noetherian ring, then &lt;math&gt;R[X]&lt;/math&gt; is a Noetherian ring.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Corollary.''' If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a Noetherian ring, then &lt;math&gt;R[X_1,\dotsc,X_n]&lt;/math&gt; is a Noetherian ring.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This can be translated into [[algebraic geometry]] as follows: every [[algebraic set]] over a field can be described as the set of common roots of finitely many polynomial equations. {{harvs|txt|authorlink=David Hilbert|last=Hilbert|year=1890}} proved the theorem (for the special case of polynomial rings over a field) in the course of his proof of finite generation of rings of invariants.

Hilbert produced an innovative proof by contradiction using [[mathematical induction]]; his method does not give an [[algorithm]] to produce the finitely many basis polynomials for a given ideal: it only shows that they must exist. One can determine basis polynomials using the method of [[Gröbner basis|Gröbner bases]].

==Proof==
:'''Theorem.''' If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a left (resp. right) [[Noetherian ring]], then the [[polynomial ring]] &lt;math&gt;R[X]&lt;/math&gt; is also a left (resp. right) Noetherian ring.

'''Remark.''' We will give two proofs, in both only the "left" case is considered, the proof for the right case is similar.

===First Proof===

Suppose &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak a \subseteq R[X]&lt;/math&gt; were a non-finitely generated left-ideal. Then by recursion (using the [[axiom of dependent choice]]) there is a sequence &lt;math&gt;\{ f_0, f_1, \ldots \}&lt;/math&gt; of polynomials such that if &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak b_n&lt;/math&gt; is the left ideal generated by &lt;math&gt;f_0, \ldots, f_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f_n \in \mathfrak a \setminus \mathfrak b_n&lt;/math&gt; is of minimal degree. It is clear that &lt;math&gt;\{\deg(f_0), \deg(f_1), \ldots \}&lt;/math&gt; is a non-decreasing sequence of naturals. Let &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; be the leading coefficient of &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt; be the left ideal in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; generated by &lt;math&gt;a_0,a_1,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is Noetherian the chain of ideals

:&lt;math&gt;(a_0)\subset(a_0,a_1)\subset(a_0,a_1,a_2) \subset \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

must terminate. Thus &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak b = (a_0,\ldots ,a_{N-1})&lt;/math&gt; for some integer &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. So in particular,

:&lt;math&gt;a_N=\sum_{i&lt;N} u_{i}a_{i}, \qquad u_i \in R.&lt;/math&gt;

Now consider

:&lt;math&gt;g = \sum_{i&lt;N}u_{i}X^{\deg(f_{N})-\deg(f_{i})}f_{i},&lt;/math&gt;

whose leading term is equal to that of &lt;math&gt;f_N&lt;/math&gt;; moreover, &lt;math&gt;g\in\mathfrak b_N&lt;/math&gt;. However, &lt;math&gt;f_N \notin \mathfrak b_N&lt;/math&gt;, which means that &lt;math&gt;f_N - g \in \mathfrak a \setminus \mathfrak b_N&lt;/math&gt; has degree less than &lt;math&gt;f_N&lt;/math&gt;, contradicting the minimality.

===Second Proof=== 
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak a \subseteq R[X]&lt;/math&gt; be a left-ideal. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak b&lt;/math&gt; be the set of leading coefficients of members of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak a&lt;/math&gt;. This is obviously a left-ideal over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and so is finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak a&lt;/math&gt;; say &lt;math&gt;f_0,\ldots, f_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; be the maximum of the set &lt;math&gt;\{\deg(f_0),\ldots, \deg(f_{N-1})\}&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak b_k&lt;/math&gt; be the set of leading coefficients of members of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak a&lt;/math&gt;, whose degree is &lt;math&gt;{}\le k&lt;/math&gt;. As before, the &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak b_k&lt;/math&gt; are left-ideals over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and so are finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak a&lt;/math&gt;, say

:&lt;math&gt;f^{(k)}_{0}, \ldots, f^{(k)}_{N^{(k)}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

with degrees &lt;math&gt;{}\le k&lt;/math&gt;. Now let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak a^*\subseteq R[X]&lt;/math&gt; be the left-ideal generated by:

:&lt;math&gt;\left \{f_{i},f^{(k)}_{j} \ : \ i&lt;N,j&lt;N^{(k)},k&lt;d \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;

We have &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak a^*\subseteq\mathfrak a&lt;/math&gt; and claim also &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak a\subseteq\mathfrak a^*&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose for the sake of contradiction this is not so. Then let &lt;math&gt;h\in \mathfrak a \setminus \mathfrak a^*&lt;/math&gt; be of minimal degree, and denote its leading coefficient by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;ins&gt;Case 1:&lt;/ins&gt; &lt;math&gt;\deg(h)\ge d&lt;/math&gt;. Regardless of this condition, we have &lt;math&gt;a\in \mathfrak b&lt;/math&gt;, so is a left-linear combination

::&lt;math&gt;a=\sum_j u_j a_j&lt;/math&gt;

:of the coefficients of the &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt;. Consider

::&lt;math&gt;h_0 \triangleq\sum_{j}u_{j}X^{\deg(h)-\deg(f_{j})}f_{j},&lt;/math&gt;

:which has the same leading term as &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;; moreover &lt;math&gt;h_0 \in \mathfrak a^*&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;h\notin\mathfrak a^*&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore &lt;math&gt;h - h_0 \in \mathfrak a\setminus\mathfrak a^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\deg(h - h_0) &lt; \deg(h)&lt;/math&gt;, which contradicts minimality.

:&lt;ins&gt;Case 2:&lt;/ins&gt; &lt;math&gt;\deg(h) = k &lt; d&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;a\in\mathfrak b_k&lt;/math&gt; so is a left-linear combination

::&lt;math&gt;a=\sum_j u_j a^{(k)}_j&lt;/math&gt;

:of the leading coefficients of the &lt;math&gt;f^{(k)}_j&lt;/math&gt;. Considering

::&lt;math&gt;h_0 \triangleq\sum_j u_j X^{\deg(h)-\deg(f^{(k)}_{j})}f^{(k)}_{j},&lt;/math&gt;

:we yield a similar contradiction as in &lt;ins&gt;Case 1&lt;/ins&gt;.

Thus our claim holds, and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak a = \mathfrak a^*&lt;/math&gt; which is finitely generated.

Note that the only reason we had to split into two cases was to ensure that the powers of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; multiplying the factors, were non-negative in the constructions.

== Applications ==
Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a Noetherian commutative ring. Hilbert's basis theorem has some immediate corollaries.

#By induction we see that &lt;math&gt;R[X_0,\dotsc,X_{n-1}]&lt;/math&gt; will also be Noetherian. 
#Since any [[affine variety]] over &lt;math&gt;R^n&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. a locus-set of a collection of polynomials) may be written as the locus of an ideal &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak a\subset R[X_0, \dotsc, X_{n-1}]&lt;/math&gt; and further as the locus of its generators, it follows that every affine variety is the locus of finitely many polynomials — i.e. the intersection of finitely many [[hypersurface]]s. 
#If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a finitely-generated &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-algebra, then we know that &lt;math&gt;A \simeq R[X_0, \dotsc, X_{n-1}] / \mathfrak a&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak a&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal. The basis theorem implies that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak a&lt;/math&gt; must be finitely generated, say &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak a = (p_0,\dotsc, p_{N-1})&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[Glossary_of_ring_theory#Finitely_presented_algebra|finitely presented]].

[[File:Números hiperreales.png|450px|thumb|Infinitesimals (ε) and infinites (ω) on the hyperreal number line (ε = 1/ω)]]

In [[mathematics]], '''infinitesimals''' are things so small that there is no way to measure them. The insight with exploiting infinitesimals was that entities could still retain certain specific properties, such as [[angle]] or [[slope]], even though these entities were quantitatively small.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuity/#1&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''infinitesimal'' comes from a 17th-century [[New Latin|Modern Latin]] coinage ''infinitesimus'', which originally referred to the "[[Infinity|infinite]][[Ordinal number (linguistics)|-th]]" item in a sequence.  
Infinitesimals are a basic ingredient in the procedures of infinitesimal [[calculus]] as developed by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], including the [[law of continuity]] and the [[transcendental law of homogeneity]]. In common speech, an infinitesimal object is an object that is smaller than any feasible measurement, but not zero in size—or, so small that it cannot be distinguished from zero by any available means. Hence, when used as an adjective, "infinitesimal" means "extremely small".  To give it a meaning, it usually must be compared to another infinitesimal object in the same context (as in a [[derivative]]).  Infinitely many infinitesimals are summed to produce an [[integral]].

The concept of infinitesimals was originally introduced around 1670 by either [[Nicolaus Mercator]] or [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

I. SCIAMVS 2 (2001), 9–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In his formal published treatises, Archimedes solved the same problem using the [[method of exhaustion]].  The 15th century saw the work of [[Nicholas of Cusa]], further developed in the 17th century by [[Johannes Kepler]], in particular calculation of area of a circle by representing the latter as an infinite-sided polygon. [[Simon Stevin]]'s work on decimal representation of all numbers in the 16th century prepared the ground for the real continuum. [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]]'s method of indivisibles led to an extension of the results of the classical authors.  The method of indivisibles related to geometrical figures as being composed of entities of [[codimension]] 1. [[John Wallis]]'s infinitesimals differed from indivisibles in that he would decompose geometrical figures into infinitely thin building blocks of the same dimension as the figure, preparing the ground for general methods of the integral calculus.  He exploited an infinitesimal denoted [[1/∞]] in area calculations.

The use of infinitesimals by Leibniz relied upon heuristic principles, such as the law of continuity: what succeeds for the finite numbers succeeds also for the infinite numbers and vice versa; and the transcendental law of homogeneity that specifies procedures for replacing expressions involving inassignable quantities, by expressions involving only assignable ones. The 18th century saw routine use of infinitesimals by mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]. [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] exploited infinitesimals both in defining [[continuous function|continuity]] in his ''[[Cours d'Analyse]]'', and in defining an early form of a [[Dirac delta function]].  As Cantor and Dedekind were developing more abstract versions of Stevin's continuum, [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]] wrote a series of papers on infinitesimal-enriched continua based on growth rates of functions.  Du Bois-Reymond's work inspired both [[Émile Borel]] and [[Thoralf Skolem]].  Borel explicitly linked du Bois-Reymond's work to Cauchy's work on rates of growth of infinitesimals.  Skolem developed the first non-standard models of arithmetic in 1934.  A mathematical implementation of both the law of continuity and infinitesimals was achieved by [[Abraham Robinson]] in 1961, who developed [[non-standard analysis]] based on earlier work by [[Edwin Hewitt]] in 1948 and [[Jerzy Łoś]] in 1955.  The [[hyperreal number|hyperreals]] implement an infinitesimal-enriched continuum and the [[transfer principle]] implements Leibniz's law of continuity. The [[standard part function]] implements Fermat's [[adequality]].

[[Vladimir Arnold]] wrote in 1990:
:Nowadays, when teaching analysis, it is not very popular to talk about infinitesimal quantities. Consequently present-day students are not fully in command of this language. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to have command of it.&lt;ref&gt;Arnolʹd, V. I. ''Huygens and Barrow, Newton and Hooke. Pioneers in mathematical analysis and catastrophe theory from evolvents to quasicrystals''. Translated from the Russian by Eric J. F. Primrose. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, 1990. p.&amp;nbsp;27&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the infinitesimal==
The notion of infinitely small quantities was discussed by the [[Eleatic School]]. The [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Archimedes]] (c.287 BC–c.212 BC), in ''[[The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]'', was the first to propose a logically rigorous definition of infinitesimals.&lt;ref&gt;Archimedes, ''The Method of Mechanical Theorems''; see [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Archimedean property]] defines a number ''x'' as infinite if it satisfies the conditions |''x''|&gt;1, |''x''|&gt;1+1, |''x''|&gt;1+1+1, ..., and infinitesimal if ''x''≠0 and a similar set of conditions holds for ''x'' and the reciprocals of the positive integers. A number system is said to be Archimedean if it contains no infinite or infinitesimal members.

The English mathematician [[John Wallis]] introduced the expression 1/∞ in his 1655 book ''Treatise on the Conic Sections''. The symbol, which denotes the reciprocal, or inverse, of&amp;nbsp;[[∞]], is the symbolic representation of the mathematical concept of an infinitesimal. In his ''Treatise on the Conic Sections'' Wallis also discusses the concept of a relationship between the symbolic representation of infinitesimal 1/∞ that he introduced and the concept of infinity for which he introduced the symbol&amp;nbsp;∞. The concept suggests a [[thought experiment]] of adding an infinite number of [[parallelogram]]s of infinitesimal width to form a finite area.  This concept was the predecessor to the modern method of integration used in [[integral calculus]]. The conceptual origins of the concept of the infinitesimal 1/∞ can be traced as far back as the Greek philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]], whose [[Zeno's dichotomy paradox]] was the first mathematical concept to consider the relationship between a finite interval and an interval approaching that of an infinitesimal-sized interval.

Infinitesimals were the subject of political and religious controversies in 17th century Europe, including a ban on infinitesimals issued by clerics in Rome in 1632.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Infinitesimal: How a Dangerous Mathematical Theory Shaped the Modern World|author=[[Amir Alexander]]|isbn=978-0374176815|year=2014|publisher=Scientific American / Farrar, Straus and Giroux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the invention of calculus mathematicians were able to calculate tangent lines using [[Pierre de Fermat]]'s method of [[adequality]] and [[René Descartes]]' [[method of normals]].  There is debate among scholars as to whether the method was infinitesimal or algebraic in nature.  When [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] invented the [[Infinitesimal calculus|calculus]], they made use of infinitesimals, Newton's ''[[fluxion (mathematics)|fluxions]]'' and Leibniz' ''[[differential (infinitesimal)|differential]]''. The use of infinitesimals was attacked as incorrect by [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]] in his work ''[[The Analyst]]''.&lt;ref&gt;George Berkeley, ''The Analyst; or a discourse addressed to an infidel mathematician''&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians, scientists, and engineers continued to use infinitesimals to produce correct results. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the calculus was reformulated by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Karl Weierstrass]], [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]], [[Dedekind]], and others using the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]] and [[set theory]].  
While the followers of Cantor, Dedekind, and Weierstrass sought to rid analysis of infinitesimals, and their philosophical allies like [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]] declared that infinitesimals are ''pseudoconcepts'', [[Hermann Cohen]] and his [[Marburg school]] of [[neo-Kantianism]] sought to develop a working logic of infinitesimals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Mormann]]; [[Mikhail Katz]]. Infinitesimals as an issue of neo-Kantian philosophy of science. [[International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science|HOPOS]]: The Journal of the International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science 3 (2013), no. 2, 236–280. {{doi|10.1086/671348}}. {{JSTOR|10.1086/671348}}. {{arXiv|1304.1027}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mathematical study of systems containing infinitesimals continued through the work of [[Tullio Levi-Civita|Levi-Civita]], [[Giuseppe Veronese]], [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]], and others, throughout the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, as documented by [[Philip Ehrlich]] (2006).  In the 20th century, it was found that infinitesimals could serve as a basis for calculus and analysis; see [[hyperreal number]].

==First-order properties==
In extending the real numbers to include infinite and infinitesimal quantities, one typically wishes to be as conservative as possible by not changing any of their elementary properties. This guarantees that as many familiar results as possible are still available. Typically ''elementary'' means that there is no [[quantification (logic)|quantification]] over [[set (mathematics)|sets]], but only over elements. This limitation allows statements of the form "for any number x..." For example, the axiom that states "for any number&amp;nbsp;''x'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''" would still apply. The same is true for quantification over several numbers, e.g., "for any numbers&amp;nbsp;''x'' and ''y'', ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''yx''."  However, statements of the form "for any ''set''&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;of numbers&amp;nbsp;..." may not carry over. Logic with this limitation on quantification is referred to as [[first-order logic]].

The resulting extended number system cannot agree with the reals on all properties that can be expressed by quantification over sets, because the goal is to construct a non-Archimedean system, and the Archimedean principle can be expressed by quantification over sets. One can conservatively extend any theory including reals, including set theory, to include infinitesimals, just by adding a countably infinite list of axioms that assert that a number is smaller than 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and so on. Similarly, the [[Complete metric space|completeness]] property cannot be expected to carry over, because the reals are the unique complete ordered field up to isomorphism.

We can distinguish three levels at which a nonarchimedean number system could have first-order properties compatible with those of the reals:

# An [[ordered field]] obeys all the usual axioms of the real number system that can be stated in first-order logic. For example, the [[commutativity]] axiom ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'' holds.
# A [[real closed field]] has all the first-order properties of the real number system, regardless of whether they are usually taken as axiomatic, for statements involving the basic ordered-field relations +,&amp;nbsp;×, and&amp;nbsp;≤. This is a stronger condition than obeying the ordered-field axioms.  More specifically, one includes additional first-order properties, such as the existence of a root for every odd-degree polynomial. For example, every number must have a [[cube root]].
# The system could have all the first-order properties of the real number system for statements involving ''any'' relations (regardless of whether those relations can be expressed using&amp;nbsp;+,&amp;nbsp;×, and&amp;nbsp;≤). For example, there would have to be a [[sine]] function that is well defined for infinite inputs; the same is true for every real function.

Systems in category 1, at the weak end of the spectrum, are relatively easy to construct, but do not allow a full treatment of classical analysis using infinitesimals in the spirit of Newton and Leibniz. For example, the [[transcendental functions]] are defined in terms of infinite limiting processes, and therefore there is typically no way to define them in first-order logic. Increasing the analytic strength of the system by passing to categories&amp;nbsp;2 and&amp;nbsp;3, we find that the flavor of the treatment tends to become less constructive, and it becomes more difficult to say anything concrete about the hierarchical structure of infinities and infinitesimals.

==Number systems that include infinitesimals==

===Formal series===

====Laurent series====
An example from category 1 above is the field of [[Laurent series]] with a finite number of negative-power terms. For example, the Laurent series consisting only of the constant term 1 is identified with the real number&amp;nbsp;1, and the series with only the linear term&amp;nbsp;''x'' is thought of as the simplest infinitesimal, from which the other infinitesimals are constructed. Dictionary ordering is used, which is equivalent to considering higher powers of&amp;nbsp;''x'' as negligible compared to lower powers. [[David O. Tall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jonhoyle.com/MAAseaway/Infinitesimals.html |title=Infinitesimals in Modern Mathematics |publisher=Jonhoyle.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713115815/http://www.jonhoyle.com/MAAseaway/Infinitesimals.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to this system as the super-reals, not to be confused with the [[superreal number]] system of Dales and Woodin. Since a Taylor series evaluated with a Laurent series as its argument is still a Laurent series, the system can be used to do calculus on transcendental functions if they are analytic. These infinitesimals have different first-order properties than the reals because, for example, the basic infinitesimal&amp;nbsp;''x'' does not have a square root.

====The Levi-Civita field====
The [[Levi-Civita field]] is similar to the Laurent series, but is algebraically closed. For example, the basic infinitesimal x has a square root. This field is rich enough to allow a significant amount of analysis to be done, but its elements can still be represented on a computer in the same sense that real numbers can be represented in floating point.&lt;ref&gt;Khodr Shamseddine, "Analysis on the Levi-Civia Field: A Brief Overview," http://www.uwec.edu/surepam/media/RS-Overview.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transseries====
The field of [[transseries]] is larger than the Levi-Civita field.&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Edgar, "Transseries for Beginners," http://www.math.ohio-state.edu/~edgar/preprints/trans_begin/&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a transseries is:

:&lt;math&gt;e^\sqrt{\ln\ln x}+\ln\ln x+\sum_{j=0}^\infty e^x x^{-j},&lt;/math&gt;

where for purposes of ordering ''x'' is considered infinite.

===Surreal numbers===
Conway's [[surreal numbers]] fall into category 2. They are a system designed to be as rich as possible in different sizes of numbers, but not necessarily for convenience in doing analysis. Certain transcendental functions can be carried over to the surreals, including logarithms and exponentials, but most, e.g., the sine function, cannot{{fact|date=May 2017}}&lt;!--this seems dubious, see [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/91337/uniformizing-the-surcomplex-unit-circle] In any case, to make the assertion clear, one should be make precise what it is to be expected from such extensions --&gt;. The existence of any particular surreal number, even one that has a direct counterpart in the reals, is not known a priori, and must be proved.{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

===Hyperreals===
{{Main article|Hyperreal number}}
The most widespread technique for handling infinitesimals is the hyperreals, developed by [[Abraham Robinson]] in the 1960s. They fall into category 3 above, having been designed that way so all of classical analysis can be carried over from the reals. This property of being able to carry over all relations in a natural way is known as the [[transfer principle]], proved by [[Jerzy Łoś]] in 1955.  For example, the transcendental function sin has a natural counterpart *sin that takes a hyperreal input and gives a hyperreal output, and similarly the set of natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; has a natural counterpart &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, which contains both finite and infinite integers. A proposition such as &lt;math&gt;\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \sin n\pi=0&lt;/math&gt; carries over to the hyperreals as &lt;math&gt;\forall n \in {}^*\mathbb{N}, {}^*\!\!\sin n\pi=0&lt;/math&gt; .

===Superreals===
The [[superreal number]] system of Dales and Woodin is a generalization of the hyperreals. It is different from the super-real system defined by [[David O. Tall|David Tall]].

===Dual numbers===
{{Main article|Dual number}}
In [[linear algebra]], the [[dual number]]s extend the reals by adjoining one infinitesimal, the new element ε with the property ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 (that is, ε is [[nilpotent]]). Every dual number has the form ''z'' = ''a'' + ''b''ε with ''a'' and ''b'' being uniquely determined real numbers.

One application of dual numbers is [[automatic differentiation]]. This application can be generalized to polynomials in n variables, using the [[Exterior algebra]] of an n-dimensional vector space.

===Smooth infinitesimal analysis ===
{{Main article|Smooth infinitesimal analysis}}
[[Synthetic differential geometry]] or [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]] have roots in [[category theory]]. This approach departs from the classical logic used in conventional mathematics by denying the general applicability of the [[law of excluded middle]] – i.e., ''not'' (''a'' ≠ ''b'') does not have to mean ''a'' = ''b''. A ''nilsquare'' or ''[[nilpotent]]'' infinitesimal can then be defined. This is a number ''x'' where ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 is true, but ''x'' = 0 need not be true at the same time.  Since the background logic is [[intuitionistic logic]], it is not immediately clear how to classify this system with regard to classes 1, 2, and 3.  Intuitionistic analogues of these classes would have to be developed first.

==Infinitesimal delta functions==
[[Cauchy]] used an infinitesimal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to write down a unit impulse, infinitely tall and narrow Dirac-type delta function &lt;math&gt;\delta_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\int F(x)\delta_\alpha(x) = F(0)&lt;/math&gt; in a number of articles in 1827, see Laugwitz (1989).  Cauchy defined an infinitesimal in 1821 (Cours d'Analyse) in terms of a sequence tending to zero.  Namely, such a null sequence becomes an infinitesimal in Cauchy's and [[Lazare Carnot]]'s terminology.

Modern set-theoretic approaches allow one to define infinitesimals via the [[ultrapower]] construction, where a null sequence becomes an infinitesimal in the sense of an equivalence class modulo a relation defined in terms of a suitable [[ultrafilter]]. The article by Yamashita (2007) contains a bibliography on modern [[Dirac delta function]]s in the context of an infinitesimal-enriched continuum provided by the [[hyperreal number|hyperreals]].

==Logical properties==
The method of constructing infinitesimals of the kind used in nonstandard analysis depends on the [[Model theory|model]] and which collection of [[axiom]]s are used. We consider here systems where infinitesimals can be shown to exist.

In 1936 [[Anatoly Maltsev|Maltsev]] proved the [[compactness theorem]]. This theorem is fundamental for the existence of infinitesimals as it proves that it is possible to formalise them. A consequence of this theorem is that if there is a number system in which it is true that for any positive integer ''n'' there is a positive number ''x'' such that 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1/''n'', then there exists an extension of that number system in which it is true that there exists a positive number ''x'' such that for any positive integer ''n'' we have 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1/''n''. The possibility to switch  "for any" and "there exists" is crucial. The first statement is true in the real numbers as given in [[ZFC]] [[set theory]] : for any positive integer ''n'' it is possible to find a real number between 1/''n'' and zero, but this real number depends on ''n''. Here, one chooses ''n'' first, then one finds the corresponding ''x''. In the second expression, the statement says that there is an  ''x'' (at least one), chosen first, which is between 0 and 1/''n'' for any ''n''. In this case ''x'' is infinitesimal. This is not true in the real numbers ('''R''') given by ZFC. Nonetheless, the theorem proves that there is a model (a number system) in which this is true. The question is: what is this model? What are its properties? Is there only one such model?

There are in fact many ways to construct such a [[dimension|one-dimensional]] [[linear order|linearly ordered]] set of numbers, but fundamentally, there are two different approaches:

: 1) Extend the number system so that it contains more numbers than the real numbers.

: 2) Extend the axioms (or extend the language) so that the distinction between the infinitesimals and non-infinitesimals can be made in the real numbers themselves.

In 1960, [[Abraham Robinson]] provided an answer following the first approach. The extended set is called the [[Hyperreal number|hyperreals]] and contains numbers less in absolute value than any positive real number. The method may be considered relatively complex but it does prove that infinitesimals exist in the universe of ZFC set theory. The real numbers are called standard numbers and the new non-real hyperreals are called [[Non-standard analysis|nonstandard]].

In 1977 [[Edward Nelson]] provided an answer following the second approach. The extended axioms are IST, which stands either for [[Internal set theory]] or for the initials of the three extra axioms: Idealization, Standardization, Transfer. In this system we consider that the language is extended in such a way that we can express facts about infinitesimals. The real numbers are either standard or nonstandard. An infinitesimal is a nonstandard real number that is less, in absolute value, than any positive standard real number.

In 2006 Karel Hrbacek developed an extension of Nelson's approach in which the real numbers are stratified in (infinitely) many levels; i.e., in the coarsest level there are no infinitesimals nor unlimited numbers. Infinitesimals are in a finer level and there are also infinitesimals with respect to this new level and so on.

==Infinitesimals in teaching==
Calculus textbooks based on infinitesimals include the classic ''[[Calculus Made Easy]]'' by [[Silvanus P. Thompson]] (bearing the motto "What one fool can do another can"&lt;ref&gt;Available online at

Another elementary calculus text that uses the theory of infinitesimals as developed by Robinson is ''Infinitesimal Calculus'' by Henle and Kleinberg, originally published in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Infinitesimal Calculus|last=Henle|first=James|last2=Kleinberg|first2=Eugene|publisher=The MIT Press, rereleased by Dover}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors introduce the language of first order logic, and demonstrate the construction of a first order model of the hyperreal numbers.  The text provides an introduction to the basics of integral and differential calculus in one dimension, including sequences and series of functions.  In an Appendix, they also treat the extension of their model to the ''hyperhyper''reals, and demonstrate some applications for the extended model.

==Functions tending to zero==
In a related but somewhat different sense, which evolved from the original definition of "infinitesimal" as an infinitely small quantity, the term has also been used to refer to a function tending to zero.  More precisely, Loomis and Sternberg's ''Advanced Calculus'' defines the function class of infinitesimals, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{I}&lt;/math&gt;, as a subset of functions &lt;math&gt;f:V\to W&lt;/math&gt; between normed vector spaces by &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{I}(V,W) = \{f:V\to W\ |\ f(0)=0, 
(\forall \epsilon&gt;0) (\exists \delta&gt;0)
\ \backepsilon\ ||\xi||&lt;\delta\implies
||f(\xi)||&lt;\epsilon\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;/blockquote&gt;as well as two related classes &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{O},\mathfrak{o}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Big O notation|Big-O notation]]) by &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{O}(V,W) = \{f:V\to W\ |\ f(0)=0,\ (\exist r&gt;0,c&gt;0)\ \backepsilon\  
||\xi||&lt; r \implies ||f(\xi)||\leq c||
\xi||\}&lt;/math&gt;, and&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{o}(V,W) = \{f:V\to W\ |\ f(0)=0,\ \lim_{||\xi||\to 0} ||f(\xi)|| / ||\xi|| = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/LoomisL.H.SternbergS.AdvancedCalculusRevisedEditionJonesAndBartlett|title=Advanced Calculus|last=Loomis|first=Lynn Harold|last2=Sternberg|first2=Shlomo|publisher=World Scientific|year=2014|isbn=978-981-4583-92-3|location=Hackensack, N.J.|pages=138–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The set inclusions &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{o}(V,W)\subsetneq\mathfrak{O}(V,W)\subsetneq\mathfrak{I}(V,W)&lt;/math&gt;generally hold.  That the inclusions are proper is demonstrated by the real-valued functions of a real variable &lt;math&gt;f:x\mapsto |x|^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g:x\mapsto x &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;h:x\mapsto x^2 &lt;/math&gt;:  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;f,g,h\in\mathfrak{I}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}),\  g,h\in\mathfrak{O}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}),\ 
h\in\mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;f,g\notin\mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f\notin\mathfrak{O}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;As an application of these definitions, a mapping &lt;math&gt;F:V\to W&lt;/math&gt; between normed vector spaces is defined to be differentiable at &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in V&lt;/math&gt; if there is a &lt;math&gt;T\in\mathrm{Hom}(V,W)&lt;/math&gt; [i.e, a bounded linear map &lt;math&gt;V\to W&lt;/math&gt;] such that &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;[F(\alpha+\xi)-F(\alpha)]-T(\xi)\in \mathfrak{o}(V,W)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;in a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  If such a map exists, it is unique; this map is called the ''differential'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;dF_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;This notation is not to be confused with the many other distinct usages of ''d'' in calculus that are all loosely related to the classical notion of the differential as "taking an infinitesimally small piece of something": ''(1)'' in the expression&lt;math&gt;\int f(x)\, d\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt; indicates Riemann-Stieltjes integration with respect to the integrator function &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;; ''(2)'' in the expression &lt;math&gt;\int f\, d\mu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d\mu&lt;/math&gt; symbolizes Lebesgue integration with respect to a measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;; ''(3)'' in the expression &lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbf{R}^n} f\; dV&lt;/math&gt;, ''dV'' indicates integration with respect to volume; ''(4)'' in the expression &lt;math&gt;dx^{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{i_n}&lt;/math&gt;, the letter ''d'' represents the exterior derivative operator, and so on....&lt;/ref&gt; coinciding with the traditional notation for the classical (though logically flawed) notion of a differential as an infinitely small "piece" of ''F''.  This definition represents a generalization of the usual definition of differentiability for vector-valued functions of (open subsets of) Euclidean spaces.

==Array of random variables==
Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})&lt;/math&gt; be a [[probability space]] and let &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. An array &lt;math&gt;\{X_{n,k}:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}\mid 1\le k\le k_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt; of [[random variable]]s is called infinitesimal if for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, we have:&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite journal |last=Barczyk|first=Adam |last2=Janssen|first2=Arnold |last3=Pauly|first3=Markus |year=2011 |title=The Asymptotics of L-statistics for non-i.i.d. variables with heavy tails|journal=[[Probability and mathematical statistics]] |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=285–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\max_{1\le k\le k_{n}}\mathbb{P}\{\omega\in\Omega\mid \vert X_{n,k}(\omega)\vert\geq\epsilon\}\to 0\text{ as } n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; 
The notion of infinitesimal array is essential in some central limit theorems and it is easily seen by monotonicity of the expectation operator that any array satisfying [[Lindeberg's condition]] is infinitesimal, thus playing an important role in [[Central limit theorem#Lindeberg CLT|Lindeberg's Central Limit Theorem]] (a generalization of the [[central limit theorem]]).

In [[number theory]], '''integer factorization''' is the decomposition of a [[composite number]] into a product of smaller integers. If these integers are further restricted to [[prime number]]s, the process is called '''prime factorization'''.

When the numbers are sufficiently large, no efficient, [[quantum computer|non-quantum]] integer [[factorization]] [[algorithm]] is known. An effort by several researchers, concluded in 2009, to factor a 232-digit number ([[RSA-768]]) utilizing hundreds of machines took two years and the researchers estimated that a 1024-bit RSA modulus would take about a thousand times as long.&lt;ref name=rsa768&gt;{{cite journal

|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has not been proven that no efficient algorithm exists. The presumed difficulty of this problem is at the heart of widely used algorithms in [[cryptography]] such as [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]. Many areas of [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] have been brought to bear on the problem, including [[elliptic curve]]s, [[algebraic number theory]], and [[quantum computer|quantum computing]].

Not all numbers of a given length are equally hard to factor. The hardest instances of these problems (for currently known techniques) are [[semiprime]]s, the product of two prime numbers. When they are both large, for instance more than two thousand [[bit]]s long, randomly chosen, and about the same size (but not too close, e.g., to avoid efficient factorization by [[Fermat's factorization method]]), even the fastest prime factorization algorithms on the fastest computers can take enough time to make the search impractical; that is, as the number of digits of the primes being factored increases, the number of operations required to perform the factorization on any computer increases drastically.

Many cryptographic protocols are based on the difficulty of factoring large composite integers or a related problem—for example, the [[RSA problem]]. An algorithm that efficiently factors an arbitrary integer would render [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]-based [[public-key]] cryptography insecure.

==Prime decomposition==
[[Image:PrimeDecompositionExample.svg|right|thumb|190px|This image demonstrates the prime decomposition of 864. A shorthand way of writing the resulting prime factors is 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; × 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]
By the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], every positive integer has a unique [[Prime factor|prime factorization]]. (By convention, 1 is the [[empty product]].) If the integer is prime then it can be recognized as such in [[Primality test|polynomial time]], for example, by the [[AKS primality test]]. If composite however, the theorem gives no insight into how to obtain the factors.

Given a general algorithm for integer factorization, any integer can be factored into its constituent [[prime factor]]s by repeated application of this algorithm. The situation is more complicated with special-purpose factorization algorithms, whose benefits may not be realized as well or even at all with the factors produced during decomposition. For example, if {{nowrap|1=''N'' = 171 × ''p'' × ''q''}} where {{nowrap|''p'' &lt; ''q''}} are very large primes, [[trial division]] will quickly produce the factors 3 and 19 but will take ''p'' divisions to find the next factor. As a contrasting example, if ''N'' is the product of the primes 13729, 1372933, and 18848997161, where {{nowrap|1=13729 × 1372933 = 18848997157}}, Fermat's factorization method will begin with {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ⌈{{sqrt|''N''}}⌉ = 18848997159}} which immediately yields {{nowrap|1=''b'' = {{sqrt|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''N''}} = {{sqrt|4}} = 2}} and hence the factors {{nowrap|1=''a'' − ''b'' = 18848997157}} and {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''b'' = 18848997161}}. While these are easily recognized as composite and prime respectively, Fermat's method will take much longer to factor the composite number because the starting value of {{nowrap|1=⌈{{sqrt|18848997157}}⌉ = 137292}} for ''a'' is nowhere near 1372933.

==Current state of the art==
{{See also|integer factorization records}}
Among the ''b''-bit numbers, the most difficult to factor in practice using existing algorithms are those that are products of two primes of similar size. For this reason, these are the integers used in cryptographic applications. The largest such semiprime yet factored was [[RSA numbers#RSA-768|RSA-768]], a 768-bit number with 232 decimal digits, on December 12, 2009.&lt;ref name=rsa768 /&gt; This factorization was a collaboration of several research institutions, spanning two years and taking the equivalent of almost 2000 years of computing on a single-core 2.2&amp;nbsp;GHz [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Opteron]]. Like all recent factorization records, this factorization was completed with a highly optimized implementation of the [[general number field sieve]] run on hundreds of machines.

===Difficulty and complexity===
No [[algorithm]] has been published that can factor all integers in [[polynomial time]], i.e., that can factor ''b''-bit numbers in time [[Big O notation|O]](''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;) for some constant ''k''.  {{citation needed span|text=Neither the existence nor non-existence of such algorithms has been proved, but it is generally suspected that they do not exist and hence that the problem is not in class P.|date=August 2017}}   The problem is clearly in class NP but has not been proved to be or not be [[NP-complete]]. {{citation needed span|text=It is generally suspected not to be NP-complete.|date=April 2018}}

There are published algorithms that are faster than O((1+''ε'')&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;) for all positive ''ε'', i.e., [[Time_complexity#Sub-exponential_time|sub-exponential]].  The best published asymptotic running time is for the general number field sieve (GNFS) algorithm, which, for a ''b''-bit number ''n'', is:

:&lt;math&gt;O\left(\exp\sqrt[3]{\frac{64}{9} b (\log b)^2}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

For current computers, GNFS is the best published algorithm for large ''n'' (more than about 400 bits). For a quantum computer, however, [[Peter Shor]] discovered an algorithm in 1994 that solves it in polynomial time. This will have significant implications for cryptography if quantum computation becomes scalable. [[Shor's algorithm]] takes only {{math|O(''b''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} time and O(''b'') space on ''b''-bit number inputs. In 2001, the first seven-qubit quantum computer became the first to run Shor's algorithm. It factored the number 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

When discussing what [[complexity class]]es the integer factorization problem falls into, it is necessary to distinguish two slightly different versions of the problem:

* The [[function problem]] version: given an integer ''N'', find an integer ''d'' with {{nowrap|1 &lt; ''d'' &lt; ''N''}} that divides ''N'' (or conclude that ''N'' is prime). This problem is trivially in [[FNP (complexity)|FNP]] and it's not known whether it lies in [[FP (complexity)|FP]] or not. This is the version solved by practical implementations.
* The [[decision problem]] version: given an integer ''N'' and an integer ''M'' with {{nowrap|1 &lt; ''M'' &lt; ''N''}}, does ''N'' have a factor ''d'' with {{nowrap|1 &lt; ''d'' ≤ ''M''}}? This version is useful because most well studied complexity classes are defined as classes of decision problems, not function problems. 

For {{nowrap|{{sqrt|''N''}} ≤ ''M'' &lt; ''N''}}, the decision problem is equivalent to asking if ''N'' is not prime. 

An algorithm for either version provides one for the other. Repeated application of the function problem (applied to ''d'' and ''N''/''d'', and their factors, if needed) will eventually provide either a factor of ''N'' no larger than ''M'' or a factorization into primes all greater than ''M''. All known algorithms for the decision problem work in this way. Hence it is only of theoretical interest that, with at most log&amp;nbsp;''N'' queries using an algorithm for the decision problem, one would isolate a factor of ''N'' (or prove it prime) by [[binary search]]. 

It is not known exactly which [[computational complexity theory|complexity classes]] contain the decision version of the integer factorization problem. It is known to be in both [[NP (complexity)|NP]] and [[co-NP]]. This is because both YES and NO answers can be verified in polynomial time. An answer of YES can be certified by exhibiting a factorization {{nowrap|1=''N'' = ''d''(''N''/''d'')}} with {{nowrap|''d'' ≤ ''M''}}. An answer of NO can be certified by exhibiting the factorization of ''N'' into distinct primes, all larger than ''M''. We can verify their primality using the [[AKS primality test]] and that their product is ''N'' by multiplication. The [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] guarantees that there is only one possible string that will be accepted (providing the factors are required to be listed in order), which shows that the problem is in both '''[[UP (complexity)|UP]]''' and '''co-UP'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known to be in [[BQP]] because of Shor's algorithm. It is suspected to be outside of all three of the complexity classes P, NP-complete, and [[co-NP-complete]]. It is therefore a candidate for the [[NP-intermediate]] complexity class. If it could be proved that it is in either NP-Complete or co-NP-Complete, that would imply NP = co-NP. That would be a very surprising result, and therefore integer factorization is widely suspected to be outside both of those classes. Many people have tried to find classical polynomial-time algorithms for it and failed, and therefore it is widely suspected to be outside P.

In contrast, the decision problem "is ''N'' a composite number?" (or equivalently: "is ''N'' a prime number?") appears to be much easier than the problem of actually finding the factors of ''N''. Specifically, the former can be solved in polynomial time (in the number ''n'' of digits of ''N'') with the [[AKS primality test]]. In addition, there are a number of [[randomized algorithm|probabilistic algorithm]]s that can test primality very quickly in practice if one is willing to accept the vanishingly small possibility of error. The ease of [[primality test]]ing is a crucial part of the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm, as it is necessary to find large prime numbers to start with.

===Special-purpose===
A special-purpose factoring algorithm's running time depends on the properties of the number to be factored or on one of its unknown factors: size, special form, etc. Exactly what the running time depends on varies between algorithms.

An important subclass of special-purpose factoring algorithms is the ''Category 1'' or ''First Category'' algorithms, whose running time depends on the size of smallest prime factor. Given an integer of unknown form, these methods are usually applied before general-purpose methods to remove small factors.&lt;ref name="Bressoud and Wagon"&gt;{{cite book

===General-purpose===
A general-purpose factoring algorithm, also known as a ''Category 2'', ''Second Category'', or ''Kraitchik family'' algorithm (after [[Maurice Kraitchik]]),&lt;ref name="Bressoud and Wagon"/&gt; has a running time which depends solely on the size of the integer to be factored. This is the type of algorithm used to factor [[RSA number]]s. Most general-purpose factoring algorithms are based on the [[congruence of squares]] method.

==Heuristic running time==
In number theory, there are many integer factoring algorithms that heuristically have expected [[Time complexity|running time]]

:&lt;math&gt;L_n\left[\tfrac12,1+o(1)\right]=e^{(1+o(1))\sqrt{(\log n)(\log \log n)}}&lt;/math&gt;

in big O and [[L-notation]].
Some examples of those algorithms are the [[elliptic curve method]] and the [[quadratic sieve]].
Another such algorithm is the '''class group relations method''' proposed by Schnorr,&lt;ref name=1982-schnorr&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schnorr|first=Claus P.|year=1982|title=Refined analysis and improvements on some factoring algorithms|journal=Journal of Algorithms|volume=3|pages=101–127 | doi=10.1016/0196-6774(82)90012-8 | issue=2 | mr=0657269|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA096348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seysen,&lt;ref name=1987-seysen&gt;{{cite journal| last=Seysen|first=Martin|year=1987|title=A probabilistic factorization algorithm with quadratic forms of negative discriminant|journal=Mathematics of Computation|volume=48|pages=757–780| doi=10.1090/S0025-5718-1987-0878705-X| issue=178 | mr=0878705}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lenstra,&lt;ref name=1988-lenstra &gt;{{cite journal|last=Lenstra|first=Arjen K|year=1988|title=Fast and rigorous factorization under the generalized Riemann hypothesis|journal=Indagationes Mathematicae|volume=50|pages=443–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is proved under the assumption of the [[Generalized Riemann hypothesis|Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH)]].

==Rigorous running time==
The Schnorr-Seysen-Lenstra probabilistic algorithm has been rigorously proven by Lenstra and Pomerance&lt;ref name=lenstra-pomerance/&gt; to have expected running time &lt;math&gt;L_n\left[\tfrac12,1+o(1)\right]&lt;/math&gt; by replacing the GRH assumption with the use of multipliers.
The algorithm uses the [[Ideal class group|class group]] of positive binary [[quadratic form]]s of [[Discriminant of a quadratic form|discriminant]] Δ denoted by ''G''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt;.
''G''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of triples of integers (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') in which those integers are relative prime.

===Schnorr-Seysen-Lenstra Algorithm===
Given an integer ''n'' that will be factored, where ''n'' is an odd positive integer greater than a certain constant. In this factoring algorithm the discriminant Δ is chosen as a multiple of ''n'', {{nowrap|1=Δ = −''dn''}}, where ''d'' is some positive multiplier. The algorithm expects that for one ''d'' there exist enough [[smooth number|smooth]] forms in ''G''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt;. Lenstra and Pomerance show that the choice of ''d'' can be restricted to a small set to guarantee the smoothness result.

Denote by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt; the set of all primes ''q'' with [[Kronecker symbol]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{\Delta}{q}\right)=1&lt;/math&gt;. By constructing a set of [[Generating set of a group|generators]] of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt; and prime forms ''f''&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt; with ''q'' in ''P''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt; a sequence of relations between the set of generators and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; are produced.
The size of ''q'' can be bounded by &lt;math&gt;c_0(\log|\Delta|)^2&lt;/math&gt; for some constant &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt;.

The relation that will be used is a relation between the product of powers that is equal to the [[group (mathematics)|neutral element]] of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt;. These relations will be used to construct a so-called ambiguous form of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt;, which is an element of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt; of order dividing 2. By calculating the corresponding factorization of Δ and by taking a [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]], this ambiguous form provides the complete prime factorization of ''n''. This algorithm has these main steps:

Let ''n'' be the number to be factored.
# Let Δ be a negative integer with {{nowrap|1=Δ = −''dn''}}, where ''d'' is a multiplier and Δ is the negative discriminant of some quadratic form.
# Take the ''t'' first primes &lt;math&gt;p_1=2,p_2=3,p_3=5, \dots ,p_t&lt;/math&gt;, for some &lt;math&gt;t\in{\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;f_q&lt;/math&gt; be a random prime form of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{\Delta}{q}\right)=1&lt;/math&gt;.
# Find a generating set ''X'' of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt;
# Collect a sequence of relations between set ''X'' and {{nowrap|{''f&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; : q'' ∈ ''P''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt;}}} satisfying: &lt;math&gt;\left(\prod_{x \in X_{}} x^{r(x)}\right).\left(\prod_{q \in P_\Delta} f^{t(q)}_{q}\right) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
# Construct an ambiguous form {{tmath|(a, b, c)}} that is an element ''f'' ∈ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt; of order dividing 2 to obtain a coprime factorization of the largest odd divisor of Δ in which &lt;math&gt;\Delta = -4ac \text{ or } a(a - 4c) \text{ or } (b - 2a)(b + 2a)&lt;/math&gt;
# If the ambiguous form provides a factorization of ''n'' then stop, otherwise find another ambiguous form until the factorization of ''n'' is found. In order to prevent useless ambiguous forms from generating, build up the [[Sylow theorems|2-Sylow]] group Sll&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Δ) of ''G''(Δ).

To obtain an algorithm for factoring any positive integer, it is necessary to add a few steps to this algorithm such as trial division, and the [[Adleman–Pomerance–Rumely primality test|Jacobi sum test]].

===Expected running time===
The algorithm as stated is a [[probabilistic algorithm]] as it makes random choices. Its expected running time is at most &lt;math&gt;L_n\left[\tfrac12,1+o(1)\right]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=lenstra-pomerance&gt;{{cite journal | first1=H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2170">{{Primary sources|article|date=August 2008}}In [[cryptography]], the '''Iraqi block cipher''' was a [[block cipher]] published in [[C (programming language)|C]] [[source code]] form by [[anonymous FTP]] upload around July 1999, and widely distributed on [[Usenet]]. It is a five round [[Feistel cipher|unbalanced Feistel cipher]] operating on a [[Block size (cryptography)|256 bit block]] with a [[key size|160 bit key]].

A [[comment (computer programming)|comment]] suggests that it is of [[Iraq]]i origin. However, like the [[S-1 block cipher]], it is generally regarded as a [[hoax]], although of lesser quality than S-1. Although the comment suggests that it is Iraqi in origin, all comments, variable and function names and printed [[string (computer science)|string]]s are in English rather than Arabic; the code is fairly inefficient (including some pointless operations), and the cipher's security may be flawed (no proof).

Because it has a constant [[key schedule]] the cipher is vulnerable to a [[slide attack]]. However, it may take 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; chosen texts to create a single slid pair, which would make the attack unfeasible. It also has a large number of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s, although that is not
necessarily a problem, except possibly for hashing modes. No public attack is currently available. As with S-1, it was [[David A. Wagner|David Wagner]] who first spotted the security flaws.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Large numbers''' are numbers that are significantly larger than those ordinarily used in everyday life, for instance in simple counting or in monetary transactions. The term typically refers to large positive [[integer]]s, or more generally, large positive [[real number]]s, but it may also be used in other contexts.

Very large numbers often occur in fields such as [[mathematics]], [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[cryptography]], and [[statistical mechanics]]. Sometimes people refer to numbers as being "astronomically large". However, it is easy to mathematically define numbers that are much larger even than those used in astronomy.

== Using scientific notation to handle large and small numbers ==
{{See also|scientific notation|logarithmic scale|orders of magnitude}}

[[Scientific notation]] was created to handle the wide range of values that occur in scientific study.  1.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, for example, means one [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], a 1 followed by nine zeros: 1 000 000 000, and 1.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; means one billionth, or 0.000 000 001.  Writing 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; instead of nine zeros saves readers the effort and hazard of counting a long series of zeros to see how large the number is.

== Large numbers in the everyday world ==
{{references|date=October 2017}}
Examples of large numbers describing everyday real-world objects are:
* The number of [[bit]]s on a computer [[hard disk]] ({{as of|2010|lc=true}}, typically about 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;, 500–1000&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]])&lt;!-- if you think this is wrong, read the numbers again, carefully. These are bits, not bytes. --&gt;
* The estimated number of [[atom]]s in the observable universe (10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;) 
* Earth's mass consist of about (4x10&lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;) [[nucleon]]s 
* The number of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the human body (more than 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;)
* The number of [[Neuron|neuronal connections]] in the human brain (estimated at 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;)
* The lower bound on the game-tree complexity of chess, also known as the "[[Shannon number]]" (estimated at around 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt;)
* The [[Avogadro constant]], the number of "elementary entities" (usually atoms or molecules) in one [[Mole (unit)|mole]]; the number of atoms in 12&amp;nbsp;grams of [[carbon-12]]; (approximately 6.022 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;)

== Astronomically large numbers ==
Other large numbers, as regards length and time, are found in [[astronomy]] and [[cosmology]]. For example, the current [[Big Bang model]] suggests that the universe is 13.8&amp;nbsp;billion years (4.355 × 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) old, and that the [[observable universe]] is 93&amp;nbsp;billion [[light years]] across (8.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; metres), and contains about 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; stars, organized into around 125&amp;nbsp;billion (1.25 × 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;) galaxies, according to  Hubble Space Telescope observations. There are about 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; atoms in the [[observable universe]], by rough estimation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universetoday.com/36302/atoms-in-the-universe/#gsc.tab=0 Atoms in the Universe]. Universe Today. 30-07-2009. Retrieved 02-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]], physicist at the University of Alberta, Canada, the longest finite time that has so far been explicitly calculated by any physicist is

::::&lt;math&gt;10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{1.1}}}}} \mbox{ years}&lt;/math&gt;

which corresponds to the scale of an estimated [[Poincaré recurrence theorem|Poincaré recurrence time]] for the quantum state of a hypothetical box containing a black hole with the estimated mass of the entire universe, observable or not, assuming a certain [[inflation (cosmology)|inflationary]] model with an [[inflaton]] whose mass is 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Planck mass]]es.&lt;ref name=page95&gt;Information Loss in Black Holes and/or Conscious Beings?, Don N. Page, ''Heat Kernel Techniques and Quantum Gravity'' (1995), S. A. Fulling (ed), p. 461. Discourses in Mathematics and its Applications, No. 4, Texas A&amp;M University Department of Mathematics. {{arxiv|hep-th/9411193}}. {{isbn|0-9630728-3-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpx.de/fp/Fun/Googolplex/GetAGoogol.html How to Get A Googolplex]&lt;/ref&gt; This time assumes a statistical model subject to Poincaré recurrence. A much simplified way of thinking about this time is in a model where the universe's history [[Loschmidt's paradox|repeats itself]] arbitrarily many times due to [[Ergodic hypothesis|properties of statistical mechanics]]; this is the time scale when it will first be somewhat similar (for a reasonable choice of "similar") to its current state again.

[[Combinatorial]] processes rapidly generate even larger numbers. The [[factorial]] function, which defines the number of [[permutation]]s on a set of fixed objects, grows very rapidly with the number of objects. [[Stirling's formula]] gives a precise asymptotic expression for this rate of growth.

Combinatorial processes generate very large numbers in [[statistical mechanics]]. These numbers are so large that they are typically only referred to using their [[logarithm]]s.

[[Gödel number]]s, and similar numbers used to represent bit-strings in [[algorithmic information theory]], are very large, even for mathematical statements of reasonable length. However, some [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] numbers are even larger than the Gödel numbers of typical mathematical propositions.

Logician [[Harvey Friedman]] has done work related to very large numbers, such as with [[Kruskal's tree theorem]] and the [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]].

== Computers and computational complexity ==
{{Original research|section|date=September 2009}}

Between 1980 and 2000, personal computer hard disk sizes increased from about 10 megabytes (10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; bytes) to over 100 gigabytes (10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; bytes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.numbersleuth.org/trends/the-amazing-history-of-information-storage-how-small-has-become-beautiful/|title = History of Information Storage|date = August 30, 2012|accessdate = October 9, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 100-gigabyte disk could store the favorite color of all of Earth's seven billion inhabitants without using data compression (storing 14 bytes times 7 billion inhabitants would equal 98 GB used). But what about a dictionary-on-disk storing all possible passwords containing up to 40 characters? Assuming each character equals one byte, there are about 2&lt;sup&gt;320&lt;/sup&gt; such passwords, which is about 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;96&lt;/sup&gt;. In his paper ''Computational capacity of the universe'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lloyd | first = Seth | authorlink = Seth Lloyd | year = 2002 | title = Computational capacity of the universe | journal = Phys. Rev. Lett. | volume = 88 | pages = 237901 | arxiv = quant-ph/0110141 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.237901 | pmid = 12059399 | issue = 23 | bibcode=2002PhRvL..88w7901L}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seth Lloyd]] points out that if every particle in the universe could be used as part of a huge computer, it could store only about 10&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt; bits, less than one millionth of the size such a dictionary would require.  However, storing information on hard disk and computing it are very different functions. On the one hand storage currently has limitations as stated, but computational speed is a different matter. It is quite conceivable {{By whom|date=February 2013}} that the stated limitations regarding storage have no bearing on the limitations of actual computational capacity, {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} especially if the current research into quantum computers results in a "quantum leap" (but see ''[[holographic principle]]'').

Still, computers can easily be programmed to start creating and displaying all possible 40-character passwords one at a time. Such a program could be left to run indefinitely. Assuming a modern PC could output 1&amp;nbsp;billion strings per second, it would take one billionth of 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;96&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, or 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt; seconds to complete its task, which is about 6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt; years. By contrast, the universe is estimated to be 13.8&amp;nbsp;billion (1.38 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) years old. Computers will presumably continue to get faster, but the same paper mentioned before estimates that the entire universe functioning as a giant computer could have performed no more than 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt; operations since the [[Big Bang]]. This is trillions of times more computation than is required for displaying all 40-character passwords, but computing all ''50'' character passwords would outstrip the estimated computational potential of the entire universe.

Problems like this [[exponential growth|grow exponentially]] in the number of computations they require, and they are one reason why exponentially difficult problems are called "intractable" in computer science: for even small numbers like the 40 or 50 characters described earlier, the number of computations required exceeds even theoretical limits {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} on mankind's computing power. The [[P = NP problem|traditional division]] between "easy" and "hard" problems is thus drawn between programs that do and do not require exponentially increasing resources to execute.

Such limits are an advantage in [[cryptography]], since any [[cipher]]-breaking technique that requires more than, say, the 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt; operations mentioned before will never be feasible.  Such ciphers must be broken by finding efficient techniques unknown to the cipher's designer. Likewise, much of the research throughout all branches of [[computer science]] focuses on finding efficient solutions to problems that work with far fewer resources than are required by a [[naïve solution]]. For example, one way of finding the [[greatest common divisor]] between two 1000-digit numbers is to compute all their factors by trial division. This will take up to 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;500&lt;/sup&gt; division operations, far too large to contemplate. But the [[Euclidean algorithm]], using a much more efficient technique, takes only a fraction of a second to compute the GCD for even huge numbers such as these.

As a general rule, then, PCs in 2005 can perform 2&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; calculations in a few minutes. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} A few thousand PCs working for a few years could solve a problem requiring 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; calculations, but no amount of traditional computing power will solve a problem requiring 2&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt; operations (which is about what would be required to brute-force the encryption keys in 128-bit [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] commonly used in web browsers, assuming the underlying ciphers remain secure). Limits on computer storage are comparable. {{quantify|date=February 2013}} [[Quantum computing]] might allow certain problems that require an exponential amount of calculations to become feasible. However, it has practical and theoretical challenges that may never be overcome, such as the mass production of [[qubit]]s, the fundamental building block of quantum computing.

The total amount of printed material in the world is roughly 1.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; bits{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}; therefore the contents can be represented by a number somewhere in the range 0 to roughly &lt;math&gt;2^{1.6 \times 10^{18}}\approx 10^{4.8 \times 10^{17}}&lt;/math&gt;

The first number is much larger than the second, due to the larger height of the power tower, and in spite of the small numbers 1.1. In comparing the magnitude of each successive exponent in the last number with &lt;math&gt;10^{10^{10}}&lt;/math&gt;, we find a difference in the magnitude of effect on the final exponent.

==Systematically creating ever-faster-increasing sequences==
{{Main article|fast-growing hierarchy}}
Given a strictly increasing integer sequence/function &lt;math&gt;f_0(n)&lt;/math&gt; (''n''≥1) we can produce a faster-growing sequence &lt;math&gt;f_1(n) = f_0^n(n)&lt;/math&gt; (where the superscript ''n'' denotes the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[functional power]]). This can be repeated any number of times by letting &lt;math&gt;f_k(n) = f_{k-1}^n(n)&lt;/math&gt;, each sequence growing much faster than the one before it. Then we could define &lt;math&gt;f_\omega(n) = f_n(n)&lt;/math&gt;, which grows much faster than any &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt; for finite ''k'' (here ω is the first infinite [[ordinal number]], representing the limit of all finite numbers k).  This is the basis for the [[fast-growing hierarchy]] of functions, in which the indexing subscript is extended to ever-larger ordinals.

For example, starting with  ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = ''n'' + 1:

* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') = ''n'' + ''n'' = 2''n''
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''n'' &gt; (2 ↑) ''n'' for n ≥ 2 (using [[Knuth up-arrow notation]])
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') &gt; (2 ↑)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'' ≥ 2 ↑&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'' for ''n'' ≥ 2.
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &gt; 2 ↑&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'' for ''n'' ≥ 2, ''k'' &lt; ω.
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &gt; 2 ↑&lt;sup&gt;''n'' – 1&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'' &gt; 2 ↑&lt;sup&gt;''n'' − 2&lt;/sup&gt; (''n'' + 3) − 3 = ''A''(''n'', ''n'') for ''n'' ≥ 2, where ''A'' is the [[Ackermann function]] (of which ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; is a unary version).
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω+1&lt;/sub&gt;(64) &gt; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;(6) &gt; [[Graham's number#Definition|Graham's number]] (= ''g''&lt;sub&gt;64&lt;/sub&gt; in the sequence defined by ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 4, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3 ↑&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 3).
**This follows by noting ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &gt; 2 ↑&lt;sup&gt;''n'' – 1&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'' &gt; 3 ↑&lt;sup&gt;''n'' – 2&lt;/sup&gt; 3 + 2, and hence ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;(''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; + 2) &gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; + 2.
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &gt; 2 ↑&lt;sup&gt;''n'' – 1&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'' =  (2 → ''n'' → ''n''-1)  =  (2 → ''n'' → ''n''-1 → 1) (using [[Conway chained arrow notation]])

== Standardized system of writing very large numbers ==

A standardized way of writing very large numbers allows them to be easily sorted in increasing order, and one can get a good idea of how much larger a number is than another one.

To compare numbers in scientific notation, say 5×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and 2×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, compare the exponents first, in this case 5 &gt; 4, so 2×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 5×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. If the exponents are equal, the ''mantissa'' (or coefficient) should be compared, thus 5×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 2×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; because 5 &gt; 2.

[[Tetration]] with base 10 gives the sequence &lt;math&gt;10 \uparrow \uparrow n=10 \to n \to 2=(10\uparrow)^n 1&lt;/math&gt;, the power towers of numbers 10, where &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow)^n&lt;/math&gt; denotes a [[functional power]] of the function &lt;math&gt;f(n)=10^n&lt;/math&gt; (the function also expressed by the suffix "-plex" as in [[googolplex]], see [[Names of large numbers#The googol family|the Googol family]]).

These are very round numbers, each representing an [[order of magnitude]] in a generalized sense. A crude way of specifying how large a number is, is specifying between which two numbers in this sequence it is.

More accurately, numbers in between can be expressed in the form &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow)^n a&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., with a power tower of 10s and a number at the top, possibly in scientific notation, e.g. &lt;math&gt;10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{4.829}}}}}&lt;/math&gt;, a number between &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow 5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow 6&lt;/math&gt; (note that &lt;math&gt;10 \uparrow\uparrow n &lt; (10\uparrow)^n a &lt; 10 \uparrow\uparrow (n+1)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt; a &lt; 10&lt;/math&gt;). (See also [[Tetration#Extension to real heights|extension of tetration to real heights]].)

Thus googolplex is &lt;math&gt;10^{10^{100}} = (10\uparrow)^2 100 = (10\uparrow)^3 2&lt;/math&gt;

Another example:
:&lt;math&gt;2 \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 4 = 
  \begin{matrix}
   \underbrace{2_{}^{2^{{}^{.\,^{.\,^{.\,^2}}}}}}\\
   \qquad\quad\ \ \ 65,536\mbox{ copies of }2  \end{matrix}
  \approx (10\uparrow)^{65,531}(6.0 \times 10^{19,728}) \approx (10\uparrow)^{65,533} 4.3
&lt;/math&gt; (between &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow 65,533&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow 65,534&lt;/math&gt;)

Thus the "order of magnitude" of a number (on a larger scale than usually meant), can be characterized by the number of times (''n'') one has to take the &lt;math&gt;log_{10}&lt;/math&gt; to get a number between 1 and 10. Thus, the number is between &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow (n+1)&lt;/math&gt;. As explained, a more accurate description of a number also specifies the value of this number between 1 and 10, or the previous number (taking the logarithm one time less) between 10 and 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, or the next, between 0 and 1.

Note that
:&lt;math&gt;10^{(10\uparrow)^{n}x}=(10\uparrow)^{n}10^x&lt;/math&gt;
I.e., if a number ''x'' is too large for a representation &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow)^{n}x&lt;/math&gt; we can make the power tower one higher, replacing ''x'' by log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''x'', or find ''x'' from the lower-tower representation of the log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; of the whole number. If the power tower would contain one or more numbers different from 10, the two approaches would lead to different results, corresponding to the fact that extending the power tower with a 10 at the bottom is then not the same as extending it with a 10 at the top (but, of course, similar remarks apply if the whole power tower consists of copies of the same number, different from 10).

If the height of the tower is large, the various representations for large numbers can be applied to the height itself. If the height is given only approximately,  giving a value at the top does not make sense, so we can use the double-arrow notation, e.g. &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow(7.21\times 10^8)&lt;/math&gt;. If the value after the double arrow is a very large number itself, the above can recursively be applied to that value.

Examples:
:&lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow 10^{\,\!10^{10^{3.81\times 10^{17}}}}&lt;/math&gt; (between &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 3&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow 10\uparrow\uparrow (10\uparrow)^{497}(9.73\times 10^{32})=(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{2} (10\uparrow)^{497}(9.73\times 10^{32})&lt;/math&gt; (between &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 5&lt;/math&gt;)

Similarly to the above, if the exponent of &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow)&lt;/math&gt; is not exactly given then giving a value at the right does not make sense, and we can, instead of using the power notation of &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow)&lt;/math&gt;, add 1 to the exponent of &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow\uparrow)&lt;/math&gt;, so we get e.g. &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{3} (2.8\times 10^{12})&lt;/math&gt;.

If the exponent of &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow \uparrow)&lt;/math&gt; is large, the various representations for large numbers can be applied to this exponent itself. If this exponent is not exactly given then, again, giving a value at the right does not make sense, and we can, instead of using the power notation of &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow \uparrow)&lt;/math&gt;, use the triple arrow operator, e.g. &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow(7.3\times 10^{6})&lt;/math&gt;.

If the right-hand argument of the triple arrow operator is large the above applies to it, so we have e.g. &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{2} (10\uparrow)^{497}(9.73\times 10^{32})&lt;/math&gt; (between &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 5&lt;/math&gt;). This can be done recursively, so we can have a power of the triple arrow operator.

We can proceed with operators with higher numbers of arrows, written &lt;math&gt;\uparrow^n&lt;/math&gt;.

Compare this notation with the [[hyper operator]] and the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;a\uparrow^n b&lt;/math&gt; = ( ''a'' → ''b'' → ''n'' ) = hyper(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;''b'')
An advantage of the first is that when considered as function of ''b'', there is a natural notation for powers of this function (just like when writing out the ''n'' arrows): &lt;math&gt;(a\uparrow^n)^k b&lt;/math&gt;. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow^2)^3 b&lt;/math&gt; = ( 10 → ( 10 → ( 10 → ''b'' → 2 ) → 2 ) → 2 )
and only in special cases the long nested chain notation is reduced; for ''b'' = 1 we get:
:&lt;math&gt;10\uparrow^3 3 = (10\uparrow^2)^3 1&lt;/math&gt; = ( 10 → 3 → 3 )

Since the ''b'' can also be very large, in general we write a number with a sequence of powers &lt;math&gt;(10 \uparrow^n)^{k_n}&lt;/math&gt; with decreasing values of ''n'' (with exactly given integer exponents &lt;math&gt;{k_n}&lt;/math&gt;) with at the end a number in ordinary scientific notation. Whenever a &lt;math&gt;{k_n}&lt;/math&gt; is too large to be given exactly, the value of &lt;math&gt;{k_{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt; is increased by 1 and everything to the right of &lt;math&gt;({n+1})^{k_{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt; is rewritten.

For describing numbers approximately, deviations from the decreasing order of values of ''n'' are not needed. For example, &lt;math&gt;10 \uparrow (10 \uparrow \uparrow)^5 a=(10 \uparrow \uparrow)^6 a&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;10 \uparrow (10 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3)=10 \uparrow \uparrow (10 \uparrow \uparrow 10 + 1)\approx 10 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have the somewhat counterintuitive result that a number ''x'' can be so large that, in a way, ''x'' and 10&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; are "almost equal" (for arithmetic of large numbers see also below).

If the superscript of the upward arrow is large, the various representations for large numbers can be applied to this superscript itself. If this superscript is not exactly given then there is no point in raising the operator to a particular power or to adjust the value on which it acts. We can simply use a standard value at the right, say 10, and the expression reduces to &lt;math&gt;10 \uparrow^n 10=(10 \to 10 \to n)&lt;/math&gt; with an approximate ''n''. For such numbers the advantage of using the upward arrow notation no longer applies, and we can also use the chain notation.

The above can be applied recursively for this ''n'', so we get the notation &lt;math&gt;\uparrow^n&lt;/math&gt; in the superscript of the first arrow, etc., or we have a nested chain notation, e.g.:

:(10 → 10 → (10 → 10 → &lt;math&gt;3 \times 10^5&lt;/math&gt;) ) = &lt;math&gt;10 \uparrow ^{10 \uparrow ^{3 \times 10^5} 10} 10 &lt;/math&gt;

If the number of levels gets too large to be convenient, a notation is used where this number of levels is written down as a number (like using the superscript of the arrow instead of writing many arrows). Introducing a function &lt;math&gt;f(n)=10 \uparrow^{n} 10&lt;/math&gt; = (10 → 10 → ''n''), these levels become functional powers of ''f'', allowing us to write a number in the form &lt;math&gt;f^m(n)&lt;/math&gt; where ''m'' is given exactly and n is an integer which may or may not be given exactly (for the example: &lt;math&gt;f^2(3 \times 10^5)&lt;/math&gt;. If ''n'' is large we can use any of the above for expressing it. The "roundest" of these numbers are those of the form ''f''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;(1) = (10→10→''m''→2). For example, &lt;math&gt;(10 \to 10 \to 3\to 2) = 10 \uparrow ^{10 \uparrow ^{10^{10}} 10} 10 &lt;/math&gt;

Compare the definition of [[Graham's number]]: it uses numbers 3 instead of 10 and has 64 arrow levels and the number 4 at the top; thus &lt;math&gt; G &lt; 3\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 65\rightarrow 2 &lt;(10 \to 10 \to 65\to 2)=f^{65}(1)&lt;/math&gt;, but also &lt;math&gt; G &lt; f^{64}(4)&lt;f^{65}(1)&lt;/math&gt;.

If ''m'' in &lt;math&gt;f^m(n)&lt;/math&gt; is too large to give exactly we can use a fixed ''n'', e.g. ''n'' = 1, and apply the above recursively to ''m'', i.e., the number of levels of upward arrows is itself represented in the superscripted upward-arrow notation, etc. Using the functional power notation of ''f'' this gives multiple levels of ''f''. Introducing a function &lt;math&gt;g(n)=f^{n}(1)&lt;/math&gt; these levels become functional powers of ''g'', allowing us to write a number in the form &lt;math&gt;g^m(n)&lt;/math&gt; where ''m'' is given exactly and n is an integer which may or may not be given exactly. We have (10→10→''m''→3) = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;(1). If ''n'' is large we can use any of the above for expressing it. Similarly we can introduce a function ''h'', etc. If we need many such functions we can better number them instead of using a new letter every time, e.g. as a subscript, so we get numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;f_k^m(n)&lt;/math&gt; where ''k'' and ''m'' are given exactly and n is an integer which may or may not be given exactly. Using ''k''=1 for the ''f'' above, ''k''=2 for ''g'', etc., we have (10→10→''n''→''k'') = &lt;math&gt;f_k(n)=f_{k-1}^n(1)&lt;/math&gt;. If ''n'' is large we can use any of the above for expressing it. Thus we get a nesting of forms &lt;math&gt;{f_k}^{m_k}&lt;/math&gt; where going inward the ''k'' decreases, and with as inner argument a sequence of powers &lt;math&gt;(10 \uparrow^n)^{p_n}&lt;/math&gt; with decreasing values of ''n'' (where all these numbers are exactly given integers) with at the end a number in ordinary scientific notation.

When ''k'' is too large to be given exactly, the number concerned can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;{f_n}(10)&lt;/math&gt;=(10→10→10→''n'') with an approximate ''n''. Note that the process of going from the sequence &lt;math&gt;10^{n}&lt;/math&gt;=(10→''n'') to the sequence &lt;math&gt;10 \uparrow^n 10&lt;/math&gt;=(10→10→''n'') is very similar to going from the latter to the sequence &lt;math&gt;{f_n}(10)&lt;/math&gt;=(10→10→10→''n''): it is the general process of adding an element 10 to the chain in the chain notation; this process can be repeated again (see also the previous section). Numbering the subsequent versions of this function a number can be described using functions &lt;math&gt;{f_{qk}}^{m_{qk}}&lt;/math&gt;, nested in [[lexicographical order]] with ''q'' the most significant number, but with decreasing order for ''q'' and for ''k''; as inner argument we have a sequence of powers &lt;math&gt;(10 \uparrow^n)^{p_n}&lt;/math&gt; with decreasing values of ''n'' (where all these numbers are exactly given integers) with at the end a number in ordinary scientific notation.

For a number too large to write down in the Conway chained arrow notation we can describe how large it is by the length of that chain, for example only using elements 10 in the chain; in other words, we specify its position in the sequence 10, 10→10, 10→10→10, .. If even the position in the sequence is a large number we can apply the same techniques again for that.

== Comparison of base values ==
The following illustrates the effect of a base different from 10, base 100. It also illustrates representations of numbers, and the arithmetic.

&lt;math&gt;100^{12}=10^{24}&lt;/math&gt;, with base 10 the exponent is doubled.

&lt;math&gt;100^{100^{12}}=10^{2*10^{24}}&lt;/math&gt;, ditto.

&lt;math&gt;100^{100^{100^{12}}} \approx 10^{10^{2*10^{24}+0.30103}}&lt;/math&gt;, the highest exponent is very little more than doubled (increased by log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;2).

*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow 2=10^ {200} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow 3=10^ {2 \times 10^ {200}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow 4=(10\uparrow)^2 (2 \times 10^ {200}+0.3)=(10\uparrow)^2 (2\times 10^ {200})=(10\uparrow)^3 200.3=(10\uparrow)^4 2.3&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow n=(10\uparrow)^{n-2} (2 \times 10^ {200})=(10\uparrow)^{n-1} 200.3=(10\uparrow)^{n}2.3&lt;10\uparrow\uparrow (n+1)&lt;/math&gt; (thus if ''n'' is large it seems fair to say that &lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow n&lt;/math&gt; is "approximately equal to" &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow n&lt;/math&gt;)
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 2=(10\uparrow)^{98} (2 \times 10^ {200})=(10\uparrow)^{100} 2.3&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 3=10\uparrow\uparrow(10\uparrow)^{98} (2 \times 10^ {200})=10\uparrow\uparrow(10\uparrow)^{100} 2.3&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow n=(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{n-2}(10\uparrow)^{98} (2 \times 10^ {200})=(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{n-2}(10\uparrow)^{100} 2.3&lt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow (n+1)&lt;/math&gt; (compare &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow n=(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{n-2}(10\uparrow)^{10}1&lt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow (n+1)&lt;/math&gt;; thus if ''n'' is large it seems fair to say that &lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow n&lt;/math&gt; is "approximately equal to" &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow n&lt;/math&gt;)
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 2=(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{98}(10\uparrow)^{100} 2.3&lt;/math&gt; (compare &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 2=(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{8}(10\uparrow)^{10}1&lt;/math&gt;)
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 3=10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{98}(10\uparrow)^{100} 2.3&lt;/math&gt; (compare &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 3=10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{8}(10\uparrow)^{10}1&lt;/math&gt;)
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow n=(10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow)^{n-2}(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{98}(10\uparrow)^{100} 2.3&lt;/math&gt; (compare &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow n=(10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow)^{n-2}(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{8}(10\uparrow)^{10}1&lt;/math&gt;; if ''n'' is large this is "approximately" equal)

== Accuracy ==

Note that for a number &lt;math&gt;10^n&lt;/math&gt;, one unit change in ''n'' changes the result by a factor 10. In a number like &lt;math&gt;10^{\,\!6.2 \times 10^3}&lt;/math&gt;, with the 6.2 the result of proper rounding using significant figures, the true value of the exponent may be 50 less or 50 more. Hence the result may be a factor &lt;math&gt;10^{50}&lt;/math&gt; too large or too small. This seems like extremely poor accuracy, but for such a large number it may be considered fair (a large error in a large number may be "relatively small" and therefore acceptable).

=== Accuracy for very large numbers ===

In the case of an approximation of an extremely large number, the relative error may be large, yet there may still be a sense in which we want to consider the numbers as "close in magnitude". For example, consider

:&lt;math&gt;10^{10}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10^9&lt;/math&gt;

The relative error is

:&lt;math&gt;1 - \frac{10^9}{10^{10}} = 1 - \frac{1}{10} = 90\%&lt;/math&gt;

a large relative error. However, we can also consider the relative error in the [[logarithms]]; in this case, the logarithms (to base 10) are 10 and 9, so the relative error in the logarithms is only 10%.

The point is that [[exponential function]]s magnify relative errors greatly – if ''a'' and ''b'' have a small relative error,

:&lt;math&gt;10^a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10^b&lt;/math&gt;

the relative error is larger, and

:&lt;math&gt;10^{10^a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10^{10^b}&lt;/math&gt;

will have even larger relative error. The question then becomes: on which level of iterated logarithms do we wish to compare two numbers? There is a sense in which we may want to consider

:&lt;math&gt;10^{10^{10}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10^{10^9}&lt;/math&gt;

to be "close in magnitude". The relative error between these two numbers is large, and the relative error between their logarithms is still large; however, the relative error in their second-iterated logarithms is small:

:&lt;math&gt;\log_{10}(\log_{10}(10^{10^{10}})) = 10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\log_{10}(\log_{10}(10^{10^9})) = 9&lt;/math&gt;

Such comparisons of iterated logarithms are common, e.g., in [[analytic number theory]].

===Approximate arithmetic for very large numbers===

There are some general rules relating to the usual arithmetic operations performed on very large numbers:

*The sum and the product of two very large numbers are both "approximately" equal to the larger one.
*&lt;math&gt;(10^a)^{\,\!10^b}=10^{a 10^b}=10^{10^{b+\log _{10} a}}&lt;/math&gt;
Hence:
*A very large number raised to a very large power is "approximately" equal to the larger of the following two values: the first value and 10 to the power the second. For example, for very large n we have &lt;math&gt;n^n\approx 10^n&lt;/math&gt; (see e.g. [[Steinhaus-Moser notation#Mega|the computation of mega]]) and also &lt;math&gt;2^n\approx 10^n&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;2\uparrow\uparrow 65536 \approx 10\uparrow\uparrow 65533&lt;/math&gt;, see [[Knuth's up-arrow notation#Tables of values|table]].

== Large numbers in some noncomputable sequences ==

The [[busy beaver]] function Σ is an example of a function which grows faster than any [[Computability theory (computer science)|computable]] function. Its value for even relatively small input is huge. The  values of Σ(''n'') for ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, 4 are 1, 4, 6, 13 {{OEIS|id=A028444}}. Σ(5) is not known but is definitely ≥ 4098. Σ(6) is at least 3.5×10&lt;sup&gt;18267&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Infinite numbers ==
{{Main article|cardinal number}}
{{See also|large cardinal|Mahlo cardinal|totally indescribable cardinal}}
Although all the numbers discussed above are very large, they are all still decidedly [[finite set|finite]].  Certain fields of mathematics define [[Infinity|infinite]] and [[transfinite number]]s. For example, [[aleph-null]] is the [[cardinality]] of the [[infinite set]] of [[natural number]]s, and [[aleph-one]] is the next greatest cardinal number. &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cardinality of the continuum|cardinality of the reals]].  The proposition that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c} = \aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[continuum hypothesis]].

== Notations ==
Some notations for extremely large numbers:
*[[Knuth's up-arrow notation]]/[[hyperoperator]]s/[[Ackermann function]], including [[tetration]]
*[[Conway chained arrow notation]]
*[[Steinhaus-Moser notation]]; apart from the method of construction of large numbers, this also involves a graphical notation  with [[polygon]]s. Alternative notations, like a more conventional function notation, can also be used with the same functions.
*[[Bird's array notation]]
These notations are essentially functions of integer variables, which increase very rapidly with those integers. Ever-faster-increasing functions can easily be constructed recursively by applying these functions with large integers as argument.

A function with a vertical asymptote is not helpful in defining a very large number, although the function increases very rapidly: one has to define an argument very close to the asymptote, i.e. use a very small number, and constructing that is equivalent to constructing a very large number, e.g. the reciprocal.

Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a [[monic polynomial|monic]], [[irreducible polynomial]] of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.  The Latimer–MacDuffee theorem gives a [[Bijection|one-to-one correspondence]] between &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;-[[matrix similarity|similarity classes]] of &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with [[characteristic polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and the [[ideal class]]es in the [[Order (ring theory)|order]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[x]/(f(x)). &lt;/math&gt;

where ideals are considered equivalent if they are equal up to an overall (nonzero) rational scalar multiple. (Note that this order need not be the full ring of integers, so nonzero ideals need not be invertible.)  Since an order in a number field has only finitely many ideal classes (even if it is not the maximal order, and we mean here ideals classes for all nonzero ideals, not just the invertible ones), it follows that there are only finitely many [[conjugacy class]]es of matrices over the integers with characteristic polynomial &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[mathematical physics]], '''level spacing''' is the difference between [[consecutive]] elements in some set of [[real numbers]].  In particular, it is the difference between consecutive energy levels or [[eigenvalues]] of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] or linear operator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5705">The '''Lwów–Warsaw school''' ({{lang-pl|Szkoła lwowsko-warszawska}}) was a Polish [[school of thought]] founded by [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] in 1895 in [[Lemberg]] (now [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]).

Although the members represented a variety of disciplines, from [[mathematics]] through [[logic]] to [[psychology]], the School is widely considered to have been a philosophical movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Woleński]], ''Filozoficzna szkoła lwowsko-warszawska'', Warsaw, [[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]], 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Developed in the 1920s and 1930s, the school's work was interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Despite this, the members went on and fundamentally influenced modern science, notably mathematics and logic, in the post-war period. The most prominent member of this school, [[Alfred Tarski]], has been ranked as one of the four greatest logicians of all time—along with [[Aristotle]], [[Gottlob Frege]], and [[Kurt Gödel]].&lt;ref name="FF"&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vaught"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vaught|first=Robert L.|date=Dec 1986|title=Alfred Tarski's Work in Model Theory|journal=[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]|publisher=ASL|volume=51|issue=4|pages=869–882|doi=10.2307/2273900|jstor=2273900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Restall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/|title=Great Moments in Logic |last=Restall|first=Greg|date=2002–2006|accessdate=2009-01-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206052240/http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/| archivedate= 6 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kazimierz Twardowski 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kazimierz Twardowski]], 1933]]
The Lwów–Warsaw school of logic lay at the origin of [[Polish logic]] and was closely associated with the [[Warsaw school of mathematics]]. It began as a more general philosophical school but steadily moved toward logic. In the 1930s Alfred Tarski initiated contacts with the [[Vienna Circle]]. In addition to Brentano, his pupils [[Anton Marty]], [[Alexius Meinong]] and [[Edmund Husserl]] also considerably influenced Polish philosophy and the Lwów–Warsaw school.

Principal topics of interest to that school included formal [[ontology]], [[mereology]], and universal or [[categorial grammar]].

==Members==
As mentioned above, many of the school's members worked in more than one field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3146">In [[mathematics]], the '''Minkowski–Hlawka theorem''' is a result on the [[lattice packing]] of [[hypersphere]]s in dimension ''n'' &gt; 1. It states that there is a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] in [[Euclidean space]] of dimension ''n'', such that the corresponding best packing of hyperspheres with centres at the [[lattice point]]s has [[packing density|density]] &amp;Delta; satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \geq \frac{\zeta(n)}{2^{n-1}},&lt;/math&gt;

with &amp;zeta; the [[Riemann zeta function]]. Here as ''n'' &amp;rarr; &amp;infin;, &amp;zeta;(''n'') &amp;rarr; 1. The proof of this theorem is indirect and does not give an explicit example, however, and there is still no known simple and explicit way to construct lattices with packing densities exceeding this bound for arbitrary ''n''. In principle one can find explicit examples: for example, even just picking a few "random" lattices will work with high probability. The problem is that testing these lattices to see if they are solutions requires finding their shortest vectors, and the number of cases to check grows very fast with the dimension, so this could take a very long time.

This result was stated without proof by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Hermann Minkowski|first=Hermann |last=Minkowski|year=1911|loc=pages 265–276}}  and proved by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Edmund Hlawka|first=Edmund|last= Hlawka|year=1943}}.  The result is related to a linear [[lower bound]] for the [[Hermite constant]].

==Siegel's theorem==

{{harvtxt|Siegel|1945}} proved the following generalization of the  Minkowski–Hlawka theorem. If ''S'' is a bounded set in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with Jordan volume vol(''S'') then the average number of nonzero lattice vectors in ''S'' is vol(''S'')/''D'', where the average is taken over all lattices with a fundamental domain of volume ''D'', and similarly the average number of primitive lattice vectors in ''S'' is vol(''S'')/''D''ζ(''n'').

The Minkowski–Hlawka theorem follows easily from this, using the fact that if ''S'' is a star-shaped centrally symmetric body (such as a ball) containing less than 2 primitive lattice vectors then it contains no nonzero lattice vectors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5611">The '''Nahm equations''' are a system of [[ordinary differential equation]]s introduced by [[Werner Nahm]] in the context of the ''Nahm transform'' &amp;ndash; an alternative to [[Richard S. Ward|Ward]]'s [[Twistor theory|twistor]] construction of [[monopole (mathematics)|monopoles]]. The Nahm equations are formally analogous to the algebraic equations in the [[ADHM construction]] of [[instanton]]s, where finite order matrices are replaced by differential operators. 

Deep study of the Nahm equations was carried out by [[Nigel Hitchin]] and [[Simon Donaldson]]. Conceptually, the equations arise in the process of infinite-dimensional [[hyperkähler reduction]]. Among their many applications we can mention: Hitchin's construction of monopoles, where this approach is critical for establishing nonsingularity of monopole solutions; Donaldson's description of the [[moduli space]] of monopoles; and the existence of [[hyperkähler manifold|hyperkähler structure]] on [[coadjoint orbit]]s of complex [[semisimple Lie group]]s, proved by [[Peter Kronheimer]], Olivier Biquard, and A.G. Kovalev.

== Equations ==

Let ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''z''),''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''z''), ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') be three matrix-valued meromorphic functions of a complex variable ''z''. The Nahm equations are a system of matrix differential equations

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{dT_1}{dz}&amp;=[T_2,T_3]\\[3pt]
\frac{dT_2}{dz}&amp;=[T_3,T_1]\\[3pt]
\frac{dT_3}{dz}&amp;=[T_1,T_2],
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

together with certain analyticity properties, reality conditions, and boundary conditions. The three equations can be written concisely using the [[Levi-Civita symbol]], in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dT_i}{dz}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j,k}\epsilon_{ijk}[T_j,T_k]=\sum_{j,k}\epsilon_{ijk}T_j T_k. &lt;/math&gt;  

More generally, instead of considering ''N'' by ''N'' matrices, one can consider Nahm's equations with values in a Lie algebra '''g'''.

=== Additional conditions ===
The variable ''z'' is restricted to the open interval (0,2), and the following conditions are imposed:
# &lt;math&gt;T^*_i = -T_i;&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;T_i(2-z)=T_i(z)^{T};\,&lt;/math&gt;
# ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be continued to a meromorphic function of ''z'' in a neighborhood of the closed interval [0,2], analytic outside of 0 and 2, and with simple poles at ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2; and
# At the poles, the residues of  (''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) form an irreducible representation of the group [[SU(2)]].

== Nahm&amp;ndash;Hitchin description of monopoles ==

There is a natural equivalence between 
# the monopoles of charge ''k'' for the group SU(2), modulo gauge transformations, and 
# the solutions of Nahm equations satisfying the additional conditions above, modulo the simultaneous conjugation of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by the group O(k,'''R''').

== Lax representation ==

The Nahm equations can be written in the [[Lax form]] as follows. Set

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
&amp; A_0=T_1+iT_2, \quad A_1=-2i T_3, \quad A_2=T_1-iT_2 \\[3 pt]
&amp; A(\zeta)=A_0+\zeta A_1+\zeta^2 A_2, \quad B(\zeta)=\frac{1}{2}\frac{dA}{d\zeta}=\frac{1}{2}A_1+\zeta A_2, 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

then the system of Nahm equations is equivalent to the Lax equation

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dA}{dz}=[A,B]. &lt;/math&gt;

As an immediate corollary, we obtain that the spectrum of the matrix ''A'' does not depend on ''z''. Therefore, the characteristic equation 

:&lt;math&gt; \det(\lambda I+A(\zeta,z))=0, &lt;/math&gt;

which determines the so-called '''spectral curve''' in the [[twistor space]] ''TP''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, is invariant under the flow in ''z''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2125">The '''Frederic Esser Nemmers Prize in Mathematics''' is awarded biennially from [[Northwestern University]]. It was initially endowed along with a companion prize, the [[Erwin Plein Nemmers Prize in Economics]], as part of a $14 million donation from the Nemmers brothers. They envisioned creating an award that would be as prestigious as the Nobel prize. To this end, the majority of the income earned from the endowment is returned to the principal in order to increase the size of the award. Even so, it is still "believed to be the largest monetary awards in the United States designated specifically for academic excellence in mathematics.&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;Observer Online, April 2004. http://www.northwestern.edu/observer/issues/2004-04-08/nemmers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the award carries a $200,000 stipend and the scholar spends several weeks in residence at Northwestern University.&lt;ref name="Nemmers_math"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nemmers.northwestern.edu/mathematics.html |title=The Frederic Esser Nemmers Prize in Mathematics |publisher=[[Northwestern University]] |accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6561">'''Nets within Nets''' is a modelling method belonging to the family of [[Petri net]]s.
This method is distinguished from other sorts of Petri nets by the possibility to provide their tokens with a proper structure, which is based on Petri net modelling again. Hence, a net can contain further net items, being able to move around and fire themselves.

== Motivation ==

Nets within nets are well suited for the modelling of distributed systems under the particular aspects of
* hierarchy,
* mobility
* encapsulation.

In a lot of publications in relation to [[object-oriented design]]  is  given,  in order to combine the ability of Petri nets in modelling distributed computing with the modelling of objects, being able to be created and to interact.

== History ==

Starting from the need of practical applications, by the mid of nineties, different formalisms have been created, which fit the description of „nets within nets“. Lomazova and Schnoebelen are listing&lt;ref&gt;Irina A. Lomazova, Philippe Schnoebelen: ''Some decidability results for nested Petri nets'', Springer LNCS 1755, 2000, pp. 208-220&lt;/ref&gt;
some of these approaches, namely by Sibertin-Blanc,&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Sibertin-Blanc: ''Cooperative Nets'', Springer LNCS 815, 1994, pp. 471-490&lt;/ref&gt; Lakos,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lakos: ''From coloured Petri nets to object Petri nets'', Springer LNCS 935, 1995, pp. 278-297&lt;/ref&gt; Moldt und Wienberg&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Moldt und Frank Wienberg: ''Multi-agent-systems based on coloured Petri nets'', Springer LNCS 1248, 1997, pp. 82-101&lt;/ref&gt;  as extending [[Coloured Petri net]]s,  aside the Object Nets of Valk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rüdiger Valk]]: ''Petri nets as token objects'', Springer LNCS 1420, 1998, pp. 1-24&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest use of such hierarchic net models appeared by [[Rüdiger Valk]] in Valk and Jessen,&lt;ref&gt;Eike Jessen, [[Rüdiger Valk]]: ''Rechensysteme: Grundlagen der Modellbildung'', Springer, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  where the so-called task-flow nets&lt;ref&gt;[[Rüdiger Valk]]: ''Modelling Concurrency by Task/Flow EN Systems''. Proceedings 3rd Workshop on Concurrency and Compositionality, GMD-Studien Nr. 191, Bonn, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  are introduced in order to model task systems in operating systems. In these models tasks are modelled by a Petri net, which represents the precedences of tasks and their state of execution.

== Semantics ==

The most important differences in semantics is given by the execution of net tokens. On the one side net tokens can be [[Reference (programming)|references]]  to net items,&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Kummer: ''Referenznetze'', Dissertation, Universität Hamburg, Logos Verlag Berlin 2002&lt;/ref&gt; which case is called „reference semantics“. This kind of semantic is distinguished from [[value semantics]], where net objects may exist in different places and different internal states. In value semantics different copies can be created to model concurrent execution. The corresponding join of such a split can be defined in different ways, as for instance by „distributed token semantics“&lt;ref&gt;Michael Köhler, Heiko Rölke: ''Properties of Object Petri Nets''. Springer LNCS 3099, 2004, pp. 278-297&lt;/ref&gt;   or „history process semantics“.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rüdiger Valk]]: ''Object Petri Nets'', Springer LNCS 3098, 2004, pp. 819-848&lt;/ref&gt; In connection with mobile computing hybrid versions of reference and value semantics are of importance.&lt;ref&gt;Berndt Farwer, Michael Köhler: ''Modelling global and local name spaces for mobile agents using object nets'', Fundamenta Informaticae, Vol. 72, No 1, pp. 109-122, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In distributed token semantics the important calculus of place invariants for Petri nets remains  valid.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Köhler-Bußmeier, Daniel Moldt: ''Analysis of mobile agents using invariants of object nets''. Electronic Communications of the EASST: Special Issue on Formal Modeling of Adaptive and Mobile Processes, 12, 2009. http://www.easst.org/eceasst/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communication ==

The formalism of nets within nets would be of few importance without communication between net tokens. Like in [[object-oriented programming]]  communication of net tokens is    introduced via predefined interfaces which are dynamically bound.

[[File:forthandback.svg|thumb|Figure 1: Nested Petri net containing channels via inscriptions]]

In Figure 1 a Petri net is shown containing a token Petri net in place „a“. The token net can move around from place „a“ to place „b“ and back by firing of the transitions of the outer net. The channel inscriptions at the transitions behave like a call of a [[Method (computer programming)|method]], resulting in the synchronised firing of the calling transition in the outer net [e.g. labelled by x:forth()] and the called transition [e.g. labelled by :forth()] in the token net. The variable „x“ at an arrow is bound to the token net in the place connected with this arrow. The brackets may contain parameters to be passed. This example is so simple that reference and value semantics coincide.

== Algorithms and restricted formalisms ==

Standard Petri net properties like [[Petri net|reachability]], [[Petri net|boundedness]] and [[Petri net|liveness]] show a mixed picture. A paper &lt;ref&gt;Michael Köhler-Bußmeier: ''A Survey of Decidability Results for Elementary Object Systems'': Fundamenta Informaticae, Vol.  130, No 1, pp. 99-123, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; of  Köhler-Bußmeier gives a survey on decidability results for elementary object systems.
To reduce the complexity of the formalism subclasses have been defined by restricting the structure of the Petri nets, as for instance to state machines. Such restrictions still allow complex modelling of distributed and mobile systems, but have polynomial complexity in [[model checking]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank Heitmann, Michael Köhler-Bußmeier: ''P- and t-systems in the nets-within-nets formalism'': Springer LNCS 7347, 2012, pp. 368-387&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Albert Gordan''' (27 April 1837 &amp;ndash; 21 December 1912) was a [[Jewish-German]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bergmann|first1=Birgit|last2=|first2=|date=2012|title=Transcending Tradition: Jewish Mathematicians in German Speaking Academic Culture|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=7z8DTwXGO-oC|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mathematician]], a student of [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]] at the [[University of Königsberg]] before obtaining his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Breslau]] (1862),&lt;ref name="mg"&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Gordan}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a professor at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]].

He was born in [[Breslau]], Germany (now [[Wrocław]], Poland), and died in [[Erlangen]], Germany.

He was known as "the king of [[invariant theory]]".&lt;ref name="itatg"&gt;{{citation|page=49|series=Invariant theory and algebraic transformation groups|title=Computational Invariant Theory|publisher=Springer-Verlag|editor1-first=Harm|editor1-last=Derkson|editor2-first=Gregor|editor2-last=Kemper|isbn=3-540-43476-3|author=Harm Derksen, Gregor Kemper.|year=2002|oclc=49493513}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="m19c"&gt;{{citation|page=85|title=Mathematics of the 19th Century: Mathematical Logic, Algebra, Number Theory, Probability Theory|editor1-first=A.

Gordan also served as the thesis advisor for [[Emmy Noether]].&lt;ref name="mg"/&gt;

A famous quote attributed to Gordan about [[David Hilbert]]'s proof of [[Hilbert's basis theorem]], a result which vastly generalized his result on invariants, is "This is not [[mathematics]]; this is [[theology]]."&lt;ref name="itatg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermann Weyl]], ''David Hilbert. 1862-1943'', Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society (1944).&lt;/ref&gt; The proof in question was the (non-constructive) existence of a finite basis for invariants. It is not clear if Gordan really said this since the earliest reference to it is 25 years after the events and after his death, and nor is it clear whether the quote was intended as criticism,  or praise, or a subtle joke. Gordan himself encouraged Hilbert and used Hilbert's results and methods, and the widespread story that he opposed Hilbert's work on invariant theory is a myth (though he did correctly point out in a referee's report that some of the reasoning in Hilbert's paper was incomplete).&lt;ref name="debunk"&gt;{{Citation|first=Colin|last=Mclarty|year=2008|url=http://www.institut.math.jussieu.fr/~harris/theology.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090116011329/http://www.institut.math.jussieu.fr/~harris/theology.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 January 2009|title=Theology and its discontents|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3184">The discipline of '''probability management''' communicates and calculates uncertainties as vector arrays of simulated or historical realizations and meta data called [[Stochastic Information Packet]]s (SIPs). A set of SIPs, which preserve statistical relationships between variables is said to be coherent and  is referred to as a '''S'''tochastic '''L'''ibrary '''U'''nit with '''R'''elationships '''P'''reserved (SLURP). SIPs and SLURPs allow Stochastic Simulations to Communicate with each other. See for example, Analytica ([[Analytica (software)|Wikipedia]]), Analytica ([http://www.lumina.com/technology/sips-and-slurps/ SIP page]), [https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E12825_01/epm.111/cb_user/frameset.htm?apas10.html Oracle Crystal Ball], [http://www.solver.com/risk-solver-stochastic-libraries Frontline Solvers], and [http://www.autobox.com/cms/ Autobox].

The first large documented application of SIPs involved the exploration portfolio of Royal Dutch Shell in 2005 as reported by Savage, Scholtes, and Zweidler, who formalized the discipline of probability management in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Probability Management, Sam Savage, Stefan Scholtes and Daniel Zweidler, OR/MS Today, February 2006, Volume 33 Number 1

&lt;nowiki&gt;http://probabilitymanagement.org/library/Probability_Management_Part1s.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The topic is also explored at length in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Flaw of Averages, Why we Underestimate Risk in the Face of Uncertainty|last=Savage|first=Sam|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2009|isbn=978 0-471-38197-6|location=Hoboken|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vectors of simulated realizations of probability distributions have been used to drive stochastic optimization since at least 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dembo|first=Ron|year=1991|title=Scenario Optimization|url=https://www.springer.com/business+%26+management/operations+research/journal/10479|journal=Annals of Operations Research|volume=30|pages=63–80|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Gelman]] has described such arrays of realizations as Random Variable Objects in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gelman|first=Andrew|year=2007|title=Manipulating and summarizing posterior simulations using random variable objects|url=https://link.springer.com/journal/11222|journal=Statistics and Computing|volume=17|pages=235–244|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 [http://probabilitymanagement.org/ ProbabilityManagement.org] was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit that supports this approach through education, tools, and open standards. The Executive Director, Sam Savage, is author of ''The Flaw of Averages: Why we Underestimate Risk in the Face of Uncertainty'' and Adjunct Professor at Stanford University. He is joined on the board by [[Harry Markowitz]], Nobel laureate in Economics. The nonprofit has received financial support from Chevron Corporation, General Electric, Lockheed Martin, PG&amp;E and Wells Fargo Bank.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6442">In mathematics, the '''random Fibonacci sequence''' is a stochastic analogue of the [[Fibonacci sequence]] defined by the [[recurrence relation]] ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; ± ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sub&gt;, where the signs + or − are chosen [[Bernoulli distribution|at random]] with equal probability 1/2, [[Independence (probability theory)|independently]] for different ''n''.

== Description ==
The random Fibonacci sequence is an integer random sequence  {''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}, where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and the subsequent terms are determined from the random recurrence relation

:&lt;math&gt;
f_n = \begin{cases}
f_{n-1}+f_{n-2}, &amp; \text{ with probability 1/2}; \\
f_{n-1}-f_{n-2}, &amp; \text{ with probability 1/2}.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

A run of the random Fibonacci sequence starts with 1,1 and the value of the each subsequent term is determined by a [[fair coin]] toss: given two consecutive elements of the sequence, the next element is either their sum or their difference with probability 1/2, independently of all the choices made previously. If in the random Fibonacci sequence the plus sign is chosen at each step, the corresponding run is the [[Fibonacci sequence]] {''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;},

: &lt;math&gt; 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,\ldots. &lt;/math&gt;

If the signs alternate in minus-plus-plus-minus-plus-plus-... pattern, the result is the sequence

: &lt;math&gt; 1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,\ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

However, such patterns occur with vanishing probability in a random experiment. In a typical run, the terms will not follow a predictable pattern:

: &lt;math&gt; 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, -2, -3, -5, -2, -3, \ldots
\text{ for the signs } +, +, +, -, -, +, -, -, \ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly to the deterministic case, the random Fibonacci sequence may be profitably described via matrices:

:&lt;math&gt;{f_{n-1} \choose f_{n}} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ \pm 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} {f_{n-2} \choose f_{n-1}},&lt;/math&gt;

where the signs are chosen independently for different ''n'' with equal probabilities for + or −. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;{f_{n-1} \choose f_{n}} =  M_{n}M_{n-1}\ldots M_3{f_{1} \choose f_{2}},&lt;/math&gt;

where {''M''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;} is a sequence of [[Independent and identically-distributed random variables|independent identically distributed random matrices]] taking values ''A'' or ''B'' with probability 1/2:

: &lt;math&gt; A=\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad
B=\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

== Growth rate ==

[[Johannes Kepler]] discovered that as ''n'' increases, the ratio of the successive terms of the Fibonacci sequence {''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} approaches the [[golden ratio]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi=(1+\sqrt{5})/2,&lt;/math&gt; which is approximately 1.61803. In 1765, [[Leonhard Euler]] published an explicit formula, known today as the [[Binet formula]],

:&lt;math&gt; F_n = {{\varphi^n-(-1/\varphi)^{n}} \over {\sqrt 5}}. &lt;/math&gt;

It demonstrates that the Fibonacci numbers grow at an exponential rate equal to the golden ratio ''φ''.

In 1960, [[Hillel Furstenberg]] and [[Harry Kesten]] showed that for a general class of random [[matrix (math)|matrix]] products, the [[matrix norm|norm]] grows as ''λ''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is the number of factors. Their results apply to a broad class of random sequence generating processes that includes the random Fibonacci sequence. As a consequence, the ''n''th root of |''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;| converges to a constant value ''[[almost surely]]'', or with probability one:

:&lt;math&gt; \sqrt[n]{|f_n|} \to 1.13198824\dots \text{ as } n \to \infty. &lt;/math&gt;

An explicit expression for this constant was found by Divakar Viswanath in 1999. It uses Furstenberg's formula for the [[Lyapunov exponent]] of a random matrix product and integration over a certain [[fractal|fractal measure]] on the [[Stern–Brocot tree]]. Moreover, Viswanath computed the numerical value above using [[floating point]] arithmetics validated by an analysis of the [[rounding error]].

[[File:Number-systems.svg|thumb|The rational numbers (ℚ) are included in the [[real numbers]] (ℝ). On the other hand, they include the [[integers]] (ℤ), which in turn include the [[natural numbers]] (ℕ)]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''rational number''' is any [[number]] that can be expressed as the [[quotient]] or [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] {{math|''p''/''q''}} of two [[integer]]s, a [[numerator]] {{math|''p''}} and a non-zero [[denominator]] {{math|''q''}}.&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite book |last = Rosen |first=Kenneth |year=2007 |title=Discrete Mathematics and its Applications |edition=6th |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-288008-3 |pages=105, 158–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since {{math|''q''}} may be equal to&amp;nbsp;1, every integer is a rational number. The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all rational numbers, often referred to as "'''the rationals'''", the '''field of rationals''' or the '''field of rational numbers''' is usually denoted by a boldface {{math|'''Q'''}} (or [[blackboard bold]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, Unicode &amp;#x211A;);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rouse|first1=Margaret|title=Mathematical Symbols|url=http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/definition/Mathematical-Symbols|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was thus denoted in 1895 by [[Giuseppe Peano]] after ''[[wikt:quoziente|quoziente]]'', Italian for "[[quotient]]".

The [[decimal expansion]] of a rational number always either terminates after a finite number of [[numerical digit|digits]] or begins to [[repeating decimal|repeat]] the same finite [[sequence]] of digits over and over. Moreover, any repeating or terminating decimal represents a rational number. These statements hold true not just for [[decimal|base 10]], but also for any other integer [[radix|base]] (e.g. [[binary numeral system|binary]], [[hexadecimal]]).

A [[real number]] that is not rational is called [[irrational number|irrational]]. Irrational numbers include [[square root of 2|{{math|{{sqrt|2}}}}]], [[Pi|{{pi}}]], [[E (mathematical constant)|{{math|''e''}}]], and [[Golden ratio|{{math|''φ''}}]]. The decimal expansion of an irrational number continues without repeating. Since the set of rational numbers is [[countable set|countable]], and the set of real numbers is [[uncountable set|uncountable]], [[almost all]] real numbers are irrational.&lt;ref name="Rosen"/&gt;

Rational numbers can be [[Formalism (mathematics)|formally]] defined as [[equivalence class]]es of pairs of integers {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}} such that {{math|''q'' ≠ 0}}, for the [[equivalence relation]] defined by {{math|(''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ~ (''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} [[iff|if, and only if]] {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. With this formal definition, the fraction {{math|''p''/''q''}} becomes the standard notation for the equivalence class of {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}}.

Rational numbers together with [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] form a [[field (mathematics)|field]] which contains the [[integer]]s and is contained in any field containing the integers. In other words, the field of rational numbers is a [[prime field]], and a field has [[characteristic zero]] if and only if it contains the rational numbers as a subfield. Finite [[field extension|extensions]] of {{math|'''Q'''}} are called [[algebraic number field]]s, and the [[algebraic closure]] of {{math|'''Q'''}} is the field of [[algebraic number]]s.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=Jimmie |last2=Linda |first2=Gilbert|author2-link=Linda Gilbert Saucier |year=2005 |title=Elements of Modern Algebra |edition=6th |publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |location=Belmont, CA |isbn=0-534-40264-X |pages=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematical analysis]], the rational numbers form a [[dense set|dense subset]] of the real numbers. The real numbers can be constructed from the rational numbers by [[completion (metric space)|completion]], using [[Cauchy sequence]]s, [[Dedekind cut]]s, or infinite [[decimal]]s.

==Terminology==
The term ''rational'' in reference to the set '''Q''' refers to the fact that a rational number represents a ''[[ratio]]'' of two integers. In mathematics, "rational" is often used as a noun abbreviating "rational number". The adjective ''rational'' sometimes means that the [[coefficient]]s are rational numbers. For example, a [[rational point]] is a point with rational [[coordinates]] (that is a point whose coordinates are rational numbers; a ''rational matrix'' is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of rational numbers; a ''rational polynomial'' may be a polynomial with rational coefficients, although the term "polynomial over the rationals" is generally preferred, for avoiding confusion with "[[rational fraction|rational expression]]" and "[[rational function]]" (a polynomial is a rational expression and defines a rational function, even if its coefficients are not rational numbers). However, a [[rational curve]] ''is not'' a curve defined over the rationals, but a curve which can be parameterized by rational functions.

==Arithmetic==
{{see also|Fraction (mathematics)#Arithmetic with fractions}}
===Irreducible fraction===
Every rational number may be expressed in a unique way as an [[irreducible fraction]] {{math|''a''/''b''}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are [[coprime integers]], and {{math|''b'' &gt; 0}}. This is often called the [[canonical form]].

Starting from a rational number {{math|''a''/''b''}}, its canonical form may be obtained by dividing {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} by their [[greatest common divisor]], and, if {{math|''b'' &lt; 0}}, changing the sign of the resulting numerator and denominator.

===Embedding of integers===
Any integer {{math|''n''}} can be expressed as the rational number {{math|''n''/1}}, which is its canonical form as a rational number.

===Equality===
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;ad = bc.&lt;/math&gt;

If both fractions are in canonical form then 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a = c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b = d&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--Examples: 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{-1}{2} = \frac{1}{-2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{0}{1} = \frac{0}{2}&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;

===Ordering===
If both denominators are positive, and, in particular, if both fractions are in canonical form,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} &lt; \frac{c}{d}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;ad &lt; bc.&lt;/math&gt;

If either denominator is negative, each fraction with a negative denominator must first be converted into an equivalent form with a positive denominator by changing the signs of both its numerator and denominator.

===Addition===
Two fractions are added as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad+bc}{bd}.&lt;/math&gt;

If both fractions are in canonical form, the result is in canonical form if and only if {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|d}} are [[coprime integers]].

===Subtraction===
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} - \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad-bc}{bd}.&lt;/math&gt;

If both fractions are in canonical form, the result is in canonical form if and only if {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|d}} are [[coprime integers]].

===Multiplication===
The rule for multiplication is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} \cdot\frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}.&lt;/math&gt;

Even if both fractions are in canonical form, the result may be a [[reducible fraction]].

===Inverse===
Every rational number {{math|''a''/''b''}} has an [[additive inverse]], often called its ''opposite'',
:&lt;math&gt; - \left( \frac{a}{b} \right) = \frac{-a}{b}.&lt;/math&gt;
If {{math|''a''/''b''}} is in canonical form, the same is true for its opposite.

A nonzero rational number {{math|''a''/''b''}} has a [[multiplicative inverse]], also called its ''reciprocal'',
:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{-1} = \frac{b}{a}. &lt;/math&gt;
If {{math|''a''/''b''}} is in canonical form, then the canonical form of its reciprocal is either {{tmath|\frac{b}{a} }} or {{tmath|\frac{-b}{-a} }}, depending on the sign of {{mvar|a}}.

===Division===
If both {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}} are nonzero, the division rule is 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{a}{b}} {\frac{c}{d}} = \frac{ad}{bc}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, dividing {{math|''a''/''b''}} by {{math|''c''/''d''}} is equivalent to multiplying {{math|''a''/''b''}} by the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of {{math|''c''/''d''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ad}{bc} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{d}{c}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Exponentiation to integer power===
If {{math|''n''}} is a non-negative integer, then
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}.&lt;/math&gt;
The result is in canonical form if the same is true for {{math|''a''/''b''}}.
In particular, 
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^0 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{-n} = \frac{b^n}{a^n}.&lt;/math&gt;
If {{math|''a''/''b''}} is in canonical form, the canonical form of the result is &lt;math&gt;\frac{b^n}{a^n}&lt;/math&gt; if either {{math|''a'' &gt; 0}} or {{mvar|n}} is even. Otherwise, the canonical form of the result is &lt;math&gt;\frac{-b^n}{-a^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Continued fraction representation==
{{Main|Continued fraction}}
A '''finite continued fraction''' is an expression such as
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{ \ddots + \cfrac{1}{a_n} }}},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are integers. Every rational number ''a''/''b'' can be represented as a finite continued fraction, whose [[coefficient]]s ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be determined by applying the [[Euclidean algorithm]] to (''a'',''b'').

== Other representations ==

* [[common fraction]]: &lt;math&gt;\frac{8}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
* [[mixed numeral]]: &lt;math&gt;2\tfrac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
* [[repeating decimal]] using a [[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]]: &lt;math&gt;2.\overline{6}&lt;/math&gt;
* [[repeating decimal]] using [[parentheses]]: &lt;math&gt;2.(6)&lt;/math&gt;
* [[continued fraction]] using traditional typography: &lt;math&gt;2 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{2} }&lt;/math&gt;
* continued fraction in abbreviated notation: [2; 1, 2]
* [[egyptian fraction]]: &lt;math&gt; 2 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Fundamental theorem of arithmetic#Canonical representation of a positive integer|prime power decomposition]]: &lt;math&gt;2^3\times3^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
* [[quote notation]]: '''3!6'''

are different ways to represent the same rational value.

==Formal construction==
[[File:Rational Representation.svg|thumb|right|300px|A diagram showing a representation of the equivalent classes of pairs of integers]]
The rational numbers may be built as [[equivalence class]]es of [[ordered pair]]s of [[integer]]s. 

More precisely, let {{math|('''Z''' × ('''Z''' \ {0}))}} be the set of the pairs {{math|(''m'', ''n'')}} of integers such {{math|''n'' ≠ 0}}. An [[equivalence relation]] is defined on this set by 
:(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ~ (''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} if and only {{math|1=''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Addition and multiplication can be defined by the following rules:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(m_1, n_1\right) + \left(m_2, n_2\right) \equiv \left(m_1n_2 + n_1m_2, n_1n_2\right),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left(m_1, n_1\right) \times \left(m_2, n_2\right) \equiv \left(m_1m_2, n_1n_2\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This equivalence relation is a [[congruence relation]], which means that it is compatible with the addition and multiplication defined above; the set of rational numbers {{math|'''Q'''}} is the defined as the [[quotient set]] by this equivalence relation, {{math|1=('''Z''' × ('''Z''' \ {0})) / ~}}, equipped with the addition and the multiplication induced by the above operations. (This construction can be carried out with any [[integral domain]] and produces its [[field of fractions]].) 

The equivalence class of a pair {{math|(''m'', ''n'')}} is denoted &lt;math&gt;\frac mn.&lt;/math&gt;  
Two pairs {{math|(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|(''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} belong to the same equivalence class (that is are equivalent) if and only if &lt;math&gt;m_1n_2=m_2n_1.&lt;/math&gt; this means that &lt;math&gt;\frac{m_1}{n_1}=\frac{m_2}{n_2}&lt;/math&gt; if and only &lt;math&gt;m_1n_2=m_2n_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Every equivalence class &lt;math&gt;\frac mn&lt;/math&gt; may be represented by infinitely many pairs, since
:&lt;math&gt;\cdots  = \frac{-2m}{-2n} = \frac{-m}{-n} = \frac{m}{n} = \frac{2m}{2n} = \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;
It is often convenient to chose, once for all, in each equivalence class a specific element called the ''canonical representative element''. This canonical representative is the unique pair {{math|(''m'', ''n'')}} in the equivalence class such that {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} are [[coprime]], and {{math|''m'' ≥ 0}}. It is called the [[irreducible fraction|representation in lowest terms]] of the rational number.

The integers may be considered to be rational numbers identifying the integer {{mvar|n}} with the rational number &lt;math&gt;\frac n1.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[total order]] may be defined on the rational numbers, that extends the natural order of the integers. One has &lt;math&gt;\frac{m_1}{n_1}\le\frac{m_2}{n_2}&lt;/math&gt; if
:&lt;math&gt;(m_1n_2 \le n_1m_2 \quad\text{if}\quad n_1n_2&gt;0)\quad \text{or}\quad (m_1n_2 \ge n_1m_2 \quad\text{if} \quad n_1n_2 &lt; 0).&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
[[File:Diagonal argument.svg|thumb|right|170px|A diagram illustrating the countability of the positive rationals]]
The set '''Q''', together with the addition and multiplication operations shown above, forms a [[field (mathematics)|field]], the [[field of fractions]] of the [[integer]]s '''Z'''.

The rationals are the smallest field with [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] zero: every other field of characteristic zero contains a copy of '''Q'''. The rational numbers are therefore the [[prime field]] for characteristic zero.

The [[algebraic closure]] of '''Q''', i.e. the field of roots of rational polynomials, is the [[algebraic number]]s.

The set of all rational numbers is [[countable]]. Since the set of all real numbers is uncountable, we say that [[almost all]] real numbers are irrational, in the sense of [[Lebesgue measure]], i.e. the set of rational numbers is a [[null set]].

The rationals are a [[densely ordered]] set: between any two rationals, there sits another one, and, therefore, infinitely many other ones. For example, for any two fractions such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} &lt; \frac{c}{d}&lt;/math&gt;
(where &lt;math&gt;b,d&lt;/math&gt; are positive), we have
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} &lt; \frac{ad + bc}{2bd} &lt; \frac{c}{d}.&lt;/math&gt;

Any [[totally ordered]] set which is countable, dense (in the above sense), and has no least or greatest element is [[order isomorphism|order isomorphic]] to the rational numbers.

==Real numbers and topological properties==
The rationals are a [[dense set|dense subset]] of the real numbers: every real number has rational numbers arbitrarily close to it. A related property is that rational numbers are the only numbers with [[finite set|finite]] expansions as [[continued fraction|regular continued fractions]].

By virtue of their order, the rationals carry an [[order topology]]. The rational numbers, as a subspace of the real numbers, also carry a [[subspace topology]]. The rational numbers form a [[metric space]] by using the [[absolute difference]] metric {{nowrap|''d''(''x'',''y'') {{=}} {{!}}''x'' − ''y''{{!}},}} and this yields a third topology on '''Q'''. All three topologies coincide and turn the rationals into a [[topological field]]. The rational numbers are an important example of a space which is not [[locally compact]]. The rationals are characterized topologically as the unique [[countable]] [[Topological property|metrizable space]] without [[isolated point]]s. The space is also [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]]. The rational numbers do not form a [[completeness (topology)|complete metric space]]; the [[real numbers]] are the completion of '''Q''' under the metric {{nowrap|''d''(''x'',''y'') {{=}} {{!}}''x'' − ''y''{{!}},}} above.

==''p''-adic numbers==
{{Main article|p-adic number}}
In addition to the absolute value metric mentioned above, there are other metrics which turn '''Q''' into a topological field:

Let ''p'' be a [[prime number]] and for any non-zero integer ''a'', let {{nowrap|{{!}}''a''{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''p''&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the highest power of ''p'' [[divisor|dividing]] ''a''.

In addition set {{nowrap|{{!}}0{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0.}} For any rational number ''a''/''b'', we set {{nowrap|{{!}}''a''/''b''{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{!}}''a''{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; / {{!}}''b''{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.}}

Then {{nowrap|''d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'',''y'') {{=}} {{!}}''x'' − ''y''{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} defines a [[metric space|metric]] on '''Q'''.

The metric space ('''Q''',''d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'') is not complete, and its completion is the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic number field]] '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Ostrowski's theorem]] states that any non-trivial [[absolute value (algebra)|absolute value]] on the rational numbers '''Q''' is equivalent to either the usual real absolute value or a [[p-adic number|''p''-adic]] absolute value.

Schnorr]], is a large prime-order [[subgroup]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_p^\times&lt;/math&gt;, the [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplicative group of integers modulo &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;]] for some [[prime]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. To generate such a group, generate &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; such that

with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; prime. Then choose any &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; in the range &lt;math&gt;1 &lt; h &lt; p&lt;/math&gt; until you find one such that

:&lt;math&gt;h^r \not\equiv 1\;(\text{mod}\;p)&lt;/math&gt;.

This value

Schnorr groups are useful in [[discrete log]] based [[cryptosystems]] including [[Schnorr signature]]s and [[Digital Signature Algorithm|DSA]]. In such applications, typically &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be large enough to resist [[index calculus]] and related methods of solving the discrete-log problem (perhaps 1024 to 3072 bits), while &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is large enough to resist the [[Birthday attack|birthday attack]] on discrete log problems, which works in any group (perhaps 160 to 256 bits).  Because the Schnorr group is of prime order, it has no non-trivial proper subgroups, thwarting [[Small subgroup confinement attack | confinement attacks]] due to small subgroups.  Implementations of protocols that use Schnorr groups must verify where appropriate that integers supplied by other parties are in fact members of the Schnorr group; &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a member of the group if &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; x &lt; p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^q \equiv 1\;(\text{mod }p)&lt;/math&gt;. Any member of the group except the element &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; is also a generator of the group.

'''Seked''' (or '''seqed''') is an ancient Egyptian term describing the inclination of the triangular faces of a right pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;Gillings: ''Mathematics in the Time of the Pharaohs'' 1982: pp 212&lt;/ref&gt; The system was based on the Egyptian's length measure known as the ''[[cubit#Ancient_Egyptian_royal_cubit|royal cubit]]''. It was subdivided into seven ''palms'', each of which was sub-divided into four ''digits''. The inclination of measured slopes was therefore expressed as the number of horizontal palms and digits relative to each royal cubit rise.

The seked is proportional to the reciprocal of our modern measure of [[slope]] or gradient, and to the cotangent of the angle of elevation.&lt;ref name=gillings&gt;Gillings: Mathematics in the Time of the Pharaohs 1982: pp 212&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, if ''s'' is the seked, ''m'' the slope (rise over run), and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; the angle of elevation from horizontal, then:
:&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{7}{m} = 7\cot(\phi).&lt;/math&gt;

The most famous example of a seked slope is of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in Egypt built around 2,550 B.C. Based on modern surveys, the faces of this monument had a seked of 5 1/2, or 5 palms and 2 digits, in modern terms equivalent to a slope of 1.27, a gradient of 127%, and an elevation of 51.84° from the horizontal (in our 360 degree system). 

==Overview==
Information on the use of the seked in the design of pyramids has been obtained from two mathematical papyri; the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] in the British Museum and the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] in the Museum of Fine Arts.&lt;ref&gt;Gillings: ''Mathematics in the Time of the Pharaohs'' 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no direct evidence of its application from the archaeology of the Old Kingdom, there are a number of examples from the two mathematical papyrii, which date to the Middle Kingdom that show the use of this system for defining the slopes of the sides of pyramids, based on their height and base dimensions. The most widely quoted example is perhaps problem 56 from the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]].

The most famous of all the pyramids of Egypt is the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] of Giza built around 2,550 B.C.. Based on the surveys of this structure that have been carried out by [[Flinders Petrie]] and others, the slopes of the faces of this monument were a seked of 5&amp;nbsp;1/2, or 5 palms and 2 digits [see figure above] which equates to a slope of 51.84° from the horizontal, using the modern 360 degree system. This slope would probably have been accurately applied during construction by way of 'A frame' shaped wooden tools with plumb bobs, marked to the correct incline, so that slopes could be measured out and checked efficiently.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Furthermore, according to Petrie's survey data in "The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh" &lt;ref&gt;Petrie: The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh 1893: pp58&lt;/ref&gt; the mean slope of the Great Pyramid's entrance passage is&amp;nbsp;26°&amp;nbsp;31'&amp;nbsp;23"&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;5". This is less than 1/20th of one degree in deviation from an ideal slope of 1 in 2, which is&amp;nbsp;26°&amp;nbsp;33'&amp;nbsp;54".  This equates to a seked of 14, and is generally considered to have been the intentional designed slope applied by the Old Kingdom builders for internal passages.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Pyramid slopes==
[[File:KhufuPyramidCasingStone-BritishMuseum-August19-08.jpg|thumb|Casing stone from the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]]]]
The ''seked of a pyramid'' is described by Richard Gillings in his book 'Mathematics in the Time of the Pharaohs' as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The seked of a right pyramid is the inclination of any one of the four triangular faces to the horizontal plane of its base, and is measured as so many horizontal units per one vertical unit rise. It is thus a measure equivalent to our modern cotangent of the angle of slope. In general, the seked of a pyramid is a kind of fraction, given as so many palms horizontally for each cubit of vertically, where 7 palm equal one cubit. The Egyptian word 'seked' is thus related to our modern word 'gradient'."&lt;ref name=gillings/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of the smaller pyramids in Egypt have varying slopes; however, like the Great Pyramid of Giza, the pyramid at [[Meidum]] is thought to have had sides that sloped by &lt;ref&gt;Petrie: Medum 1892&lt;/ref&gt; 51.842° or&amp;nbsp;51°&amp;nbsp;50'&amp;nbsp;35", which is a seked of 5{{frac|1|2}} palms.

The Great Pyramid scholar Professor I.E.S Edwards considered this to have been the 'normal' or most typical slope choice for pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards. The Pyramids of Egypt 1979. pp269&lt;/ref&gt; Flinders Petrie also noted the similarity of the slope of this pyramid to that of the Great Pyramid at Giza, and both Egyptologists considered it to have been a deliberate choice, based on a desire to ensure that the circuit of the base of the pyramids precisely equalled the length of a circle that would be swept out if the pyramid's height were used as a radius.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbody. Egyptian Tomb Architecture: The Archaeological Facts of Pharaonic Circular Symbolism 2008: pp 22–27,&lt;/ref&gt; Petrie wrote "...these relations of areas and of circular ratio are so systematic that we should grant that they were in the builder's design".&lt;ref&gt;Petrie Wisdom of the Egyptians 1940: 30&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2733">The '''Sierpiński arrowhead curve''' is a fractal curve similar in appearance and identical in limit to the [[Sierpiński triangle]].

[[Image:Arrowhead curve 1 through 6.png|thumb|right|400px|Evolution of Sierpiński arrowhead curve]]

The Sierpiński arrowhead curve draws an equilateral triangle with triangular holes at equal intervals. It can be described with two substituting production rules: (A → B-A-B) and (B → A+B+A). A and B recur and at the bottom do the same thing — draw a line. Plus and minus (+ and -) mean turn 60 degrees either left or right. The terminating point of the Sierpiński arrowhead curve is always the same provided you recur an even number of times and you halve the length of the line at each recursion. If you recur to an odd depth (order is odd) then you end up turned 60 degrees, at a different point in the triangle.

In code, given these drawing functions:
void draw_line( double distance);
void turn( int angle_in_degrees);
The code to draw an (approximate) Sierpiński arrowhead curve looks like this.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="cpp"&gt;
void sierpinski_arrowhead_curve( unsigned order, double length)
{
    // If order is even we can just draw the curve.
    if ( 0 == (order &amp; 1) ) {
        curve( order, length, +60);
    }
    else /* order is odd */ {
        turn( +60);
        curve( order, length, -60);
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="cpp"&gt;
void curve( unsigned order, double length, int angle)
{
    if ( 0 == order ) {
        draw_line( length);
    } else {
        curve( order - 1, length / 2, - angle);
        turn( + angle);
        curve( order - 1, length / 2, + angle);
        turn( + angle);
        curve( order - 1, length / 2, - angle);
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Representation as Lindenmayer system==
The Sierpiński arrowhead curve can be expressed by a [[rewriting|rewrite system]] ([[L-system]]).

:'''Alphabet''':   X, Y
:'''Constants''':   F, +, &amp;minus;
:'''Axiom''':   XF   
:'''Production rules''':     
:       X &amp;rarr; YF + XF + Y
:       Y &amp;rarr; XF &amp;minus; YF &amp;minus; X

Here, ''F'' means “draw forward”, + means “turn left 60°”, and ''&amp;minus;'' means “turn right 60°” (see [[turtle graphics]]).

Like many two-dimensional fractal curves, the Sierpiński arrowhead curve can be extended to three dimensions:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4069">In [[mathematics]], the '''Smith conjecture'''  states that if ''f'' is a [[diffeomorphism]]  of the [[3-sphere]] of [[Order (group theory)|finite order]], then the [[fixed point set]] of ''f'' cannot be a nontrivial [[knot (mathematics)|knot]].

{{harvs|txt|last=Smith|first=Paul A.|authorlink=Paul Althaus Smith|year=1939|loc=remark after theorem 4}} showed that a non-trivial [[orientation-preserving]] diffeomorphism of finite order with fixed points must have fixed point set equal to a circle, and asked in {{harv|Eilenberg|1949|loc=Problem 36}} if the fixed point set can be knotted.  {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Friedhelm Waldhausen|last=Waldhausen|first=Friedhelm|year=1969}} proved the Smith conjecture for the special case of diffeomorphisms of order 2 (and hence any even order).  The proof of the general case was  described by {{harvs|txt| last1=Morgan | first1=John| author1-link=John Morgan (mathematician)|last2=Bass | first2=Hyman|author2-link=Hyman Bass|year=1984}} and depended on several major advances in [[3-manifold]] theory, in particular the work of [[William Thurston]] on [[hyperbolic 3-manifold|hyperbolic structures]] on 3-manifolds, and results by [[William Meeks]] and [[Shing-Tung Yau]] on [[minimal surface]]s in 3-manifolds, with some additional help from Bass,  [[Cameron Gordon (mathematician)|Cameron Gordon]], [[Peter Shalen]], and Rick Litherland.

{{harvs|txt| last1=Montgomery | first1=Deane |author1-link=Deane Montgomery| last2=Zippin | first2=Leo|author2-link=Leo Zippin |year=1954}} gave an example of a continuous involution of the 3-sphere whose fixed point set is a wildly embedded circle, so the Smith conjecture is false in the topological (rather than the smooth or PL) category. {{harvs|txt|last=Giffen|first=Charles|year=1966}} showed that the analogue of the Smith conjecture in higher dimensions is false: the fixed point set of a periodic diffeomorphism  of a sphere of dimension at least 4 can be a knotted sphere of codimension 2.

'''Spectral flux''' is a measure of how quickly the [[power spectrum]] of a [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] is changing, calculated by comparing the power spectrum for one frame against the power spectrum from the previous frame.&lt;ref name=Giannoulis/&gt; More precisely, it is usually calculated as the 2-norm (also known as the [[Euclidean distance]]) between the two [[Audio normalization|normalised]] spectra.

Calculated this way, the spectral flux is not dependent upon overall power (since the spectra are normalised), nor on phase considerations (since only the magnitudes are compared).

The spectral flux can be used to determine the [[timbre]] of an audio signal, or in [[Onset (audio)|onset]] detection,&lt;ref name=Dixon/&gt; among other things.

==Variations==

Some implementations use the 1-norm rather than the 2-norm (i.e. the sum rather than the Euclidean distance).

Some implementations do not normalise the spectra.

For onset detection, increases in energy are important (not decreases), so some algorithms only include values calculated from bins in which the energy is increasing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19862">The '''Stackelberg leadership model''' is a strategic game in [[economics]] in which the leader firm moves first and then the follower firms move sequentially. It is named after the German economist [[Heinrich Freiherr von Stackelberg]] who published ''[[Market Structure and Equilibrium]] (Marktform und Gleichgewicht)'' in 1934 which described the model.

In [[game theory]] terms, the players of this game are a ''leader'' and a ''follower'' and they compete on quantity. The Stackelberg leader is sometimes referred to as the Market Leader.

There are some further constraints upon the sustaining of a Stackelberg equilibrium. The leader must know ''[[ex ante]]'' that the follower observes its action. The follower must have no means of committing to a future non-Stackelberg follower action and the leader must know this. Indeed, if the 'follower' could commit to a Stackelberg leader action and the 'leader' knew this, the leader's best response would be to play a Stackelberg follower action.

Firms may engage in Stackelberg competition if one has some sort of advantage enabling it to move first. More generally, the leader must have [[Promise|commitment]] power. Moving observably first is the most obvious means of commitment: once the leader has made its move, it cannot undo it - it is committed to that action. Moving first may be possible if the leader was the incumbent monopoly of the industry and the follower is a new entrant. Holding excess capacity is another means of commitment.

== Subgame perfect Nash equilibrium ==

The Stackelberg model can be solved to find the [[subgame perfect Nash equilibrium]] or equilibria (SPNE), i.e. the strategy profile that serves best each player, given the strategies of the other player and that entails every player playing in a [[Nash equilibrium]] in every [[subgame]].

In very general terms, let the price function for the (duopoly) industry be &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;; price is simply a function of total (industry) output, so is &lt;math&gt;P(q_1+q_2)&lt;/math&gt; where the subscript 1 represents the leader and 2 represents the follower. Suppose firm &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; has the cost structure &lt;math&gt;C_i(q_i)&lt;/math&gt;. The model is solved by [[solution concept|backward induction]]. The leader considers what the [[best response]] of the follower is, i.e. how it ''will'' respond once it has observed the quantity of the leader. The leader then picks a quantity that maximises its payoff, anticipating the predicted response of the follower. The follower actually observes this and in equilibrium picks the expected quantity as a response.

To calculate the SPNE, the [[the best response|best response functions]] of the follower must first be calculated (calculation moves 'backwards' because of backward induction).

The profit of firm 2 (the follower) is revenue minus cost. Revenue is the product of price and quantity and cost is given by the firm's cost structure, so profit is:
&lt;math&gt;\Pi_2 = P(q_1+q_2) \cdot q_2 - C_2(q_2)&lt;/math&gt;. The best response is to find the value of &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; that maximises &lt;math&gt;\Pi_2&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. given the output of the leader (firm 1), the output that maximises the follower's profit is found. Hence, the maximum of &lt;math&gt;\Pi_2&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; is to be found. First differentiate &lt;math&gt;\Pi_2&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Pi_2 }{\partial q_2} = \frac{\partial P(q_1+q_2) }{\partial q_2} \cdot q_2 + P(q_1+q_2) - \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Setting this to zero for maximisation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Pi_2 }{\partial q_2} = \frac{\partial P(q_1+q_2) }{\partial q_2} \cdot q_2 + P(q_1+q_2) - \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The values of &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy this equation are the best responses. Now the best response function of the leader is considered. This function is calculated by considering the follower's output as a function of the leader's output, as just computed.

The profit of firm 1 (the leader) is &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1 = P(q_1+q_2(q_1)).q_1 - C_1(q_1)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q_2(q_1)&lt;/math&gt; is the follower's quantity as a function of the leader's quantity, namely the function calculated above. The best response is to find the value of &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; that maximises &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;q_2(q_1)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. given the best response function of the follower (firm 2), the output that maximises the leader's profit is found. Hence, the maximum of &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; is to be found. First, differentiate &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Pi_1}{\partial q_1} = \frac{\partial P(q_1+q_2)}{\partial q_2} \cdot \frac{\partial q_2(q_1)}{\partial q_1} \cdot q_1 +\frac{\partial P(q_1+q_2)}{\partial q_1} \cdot q_1+ P(q_1+q_2(q_1)) - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Setting this to zero for maximisation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Pi_1}{\partial q_1} = \frac{\partial P(q_1+q_2)}{\partial q_2} \cdot \frac{\partial q_2(q_1)}{\partial q_1} \cdot q_1+\frac{\partial P(q_1+q_2)}{\partial q_1} \cdot q_1 + P(q_1+q_2(q_1)) - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Examples ===

The following example is very general. It assumes a generalised linear demand structure

:&lt;math&gt;p(q_1+q_2) = \bigg(a - b(q_1+q_2)\bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

and imposes some restrictions on cost structures for simplicity's sake so the problem can be resolved.

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial ^2C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_i  \cdot  \partial q_j}=0,\forall j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial C_i (q_i)}{\partial q_j}=0, j \ne \ i&lt;/math&gt;

for ease of computation.

The follower's profit is:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_2 = \bigg(a - b(q_1+q_2)\bigg) \cdot q_2 - C_2(q_2).&lt;/math&gt;

The maximisation problem resolves to (from the general case):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \bigg(a - b(q_1+q_2)\bigg) }{\partial q_2} \cdot q_2 + a - b(q_1+q_2) - \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ - bq_2 + a - b(q_1+q_2) - \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ q_2 = \frac{a - bq_1 - \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}}{2b}.&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the leader's problem:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi_1 = \bigg(a - b(q_1+q_2(q_1))\bigg) \cdot q_1 - C_1(q_1).&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for &lt;math&gt;q_2(q_1)&lt;/math&gt; from the follower's problem:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi_1 = \bigg(a - b\bigg(q_1+\frac{a - bq_1 - \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}}{2b}\bigg)\bigg) \cdot q_1 - C_1(q_1),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \Pi_1 = \bigg(\frac{a - b.q_1 + \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}}{2})\bigg) \cdot q_1 - C_1(q_1).&lt;/math&gt;

The maximisation problem resolves to (from the general case):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial \pi_1}{\partial q_1} = \bigg(\frac{a - 2bq_1 + \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}}{2}\bigg) - \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Now solving for &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;q_1^*&lt;/math&gt;, the leader's optimal action:

:&lt;math&gt;q_1^*=\frac{a + \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial p_2}- 2 \cdot  \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}}{2b}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the leader's best response to the reaction of the follower in equilibrium. The follower's actual can now be found by feeding this into its reaction function calculated earlier:

:&lt;math&gt;q_2^* = \frac{a - b \cdot  \frac{a + \frac{\partial C_2 (p_2)}{\partial p_2}- 2 \cdot  \frac{\partial C_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}}{2b} - \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}}{2b},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow q_2^* = \frac{a - 3 \cdot  \frac{\partial C_2 (q_2)}{\partial q_2}+ 2 \cdot  \frac{\partial q_1 (q_1)}{\partial q_1}}{4b}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Nash equilibria are all &lt;math&gt;(q_1^*, q_2^*)&lt;/math&gt;. It is clear (if marginal costs are assumed to be zero - i.e. cost is essentially ignored) that the leader has a significant advantage. Intuitively, if the leader was no better off than the follower, it would simply adopt a [[Cournot competition]] strategy.

Plugging the follower's quantity &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;, back into the leader's best response function will not yield &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt;. This is because once leader has committed to an output and observed the followers it always wants to reduce its output ex-post. However its inability to do so is what allows it to receive higher profits than under cournot.

== Economic analysis ==

An extensive-form representation is often used to analyze the Stackelberg leader-follower model. Also referred to as a “[[decision tree]]”, the model shows the combination of outputs and payoffs both firms have in the Stackelberg game

[[File:Extensive form game 4.JPG|300px|left|thumb|A Stackelberg game represented in [[extensive form game|extensive form]]]]

The image on the left depicts in [[extensive form game|extensive form]] a Stackelberg game. The payoffs are shown on the right. This example is fairly simple. There is a basic cost structure involving only [[marginal cost]] (there is no [[fixed cost]]). The demand function is linear and price elasticity of demand is 1. However, it illustrates the leader's advantage.

The follower wants to choose &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; to maximise its payoff &lt;math&gt;q_2 * (5000-q_1-q_2-c_2)&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the first order derivative and equating it to zero (for maximisation) yields 
&lt;math&gt;q_2=\frac{5000-q_1-c_2}{2}&lt;/math&gt; as the maximum value of &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;.

The leader wants to choose &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; to maximise its payoff &lt;math&gt;q_1 * (5000-q_1-q_2-c_1)&lt;/math&gt;. However, in equilibrium, it knows the follower will choose &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; as above. So in fact the leader wants to maximise its payoff &lt;math&gt;q_1 * (5000-q_1-\frac{5000-q_1-c_2}{2}-c_1)&lt;/math&gt; (by substituting &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; for the follower's best response function). By differentiation, the maximum payoff is given by &lt;math&gt;q_1=\frac{5000-2c_1+c_2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Feeding this into the follower's best response function yields &lt;math&gt;q_2=\frac{5000+2c_1-3c_2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose marginal costs were equal for the firms (so the leader has no market advantage other than first move) and in particular &lt;math&gt;c_1=c_2=1000&lt;/math&gt;. The leader would produce 2000 and the follower would produce 1000. This would give the leader a profit (payoff) of two million and the follower a profit of one million. Simply by moving first, the leader has accrued twice the profit of the follower. However, [[Cournot competition|Cournot profits]] here are 1.78 million apiece (strictly, &lt;math&gt;(16/9)10^{6}&lt;/math&gt; apiece), so the leader has not gained much, but the follower has lost. However, this is example-specific. There may be cases where a Stackelberg leader has huge gains beyond Cournot profit that approach [[monopoly]] profits (for example, if the leader also had a large cost structure advantage, perhaps due to a better [[production function]]). There may also be cases where the follower actually enjoys higher profits than the leader, but only because it, say, has much lower costs. This behaviour consistently work on duopoly markets even if the firms are asymmetrical.

==Credible and non-credible threats by the follower==
If, after the leader had selected its equilibrium quantity, the follower deviated from the equilibrium and chose some non-optimal quantity it would not only hurt itself, but it could also hurt the leader. If the follower chose a much larger quantity than its best response, the market price would lower and the leader's profits would be stung, perhaps below Cournot level profits. In this case, the follower could announce to the leader before the game starts that unless the leader chooses a Cournot equilibrium quantity, the follower will choose a deviant quantity that will hit the leader's profits. After all, the quantity chosen by the leader in equilibrium is only optimal if the follower also plays in equilibrium. The leader is, however, in no danger. Once the leader has chosen its equilibrium quantity, it would be irrational for the follower to deviate because it too would be hurt. Once the leader has chosen, the follower is better off by playing on the equilibrium path. Hence, such a threat by the follower would not be credible.

However, in an (indefinitely) repeated Stackelberg game, the follower might adopt a punishment strategy where it threatens to punish the leader in the next period unless it chooses a non-optimal strategy in the current period. This threat may be credible because it could be rational for the follower to punish in the next period so that the leader chooses Cournot quantities thereafter.

== Stackelberg compared with Cournot ==

The Stackelberg and [[Cournot competition|Cournot]] models are similar because in both competition is on quantity. However, as seen, the first move gives the leader in Stackelberg a crucial advantage. There is also the important assumption of [[perfect information]] in the Stackelberg game: the follower must observe the quantity chosen by the leader, otherwise the game reduces to Cournot. With imperfect information, the threats described above can be credible. If the follower cannot observe the leader's move, it is no longer irrational for the follower to choose, say, a Cournot level of quantity (in fact, that is the equilibrium action). However, it must be that there ''is'' imperfect information and the follower ''is'' unable to observe the leader's move because it is irrational for the follower not to observe if it can once the leader has moved. If it can observe, it will so that it can make the optimal decision. Any threat by the follower claiming that it will not observe even if it can is as uncredible as those above. This is an example of too much information hurting a player. In Cournot competition, it is the simultaneity of the game (the imperfection of knowledge) that results in neither player (''[[ceteris paribus]]'') being at a disadvantage.

=== [[Game theory|Game theoretic]] considerations ===

As mentioned, imperfect information in a leadership game reduces to Cournot competition. However, some Cournot strategy profiles are sustained as [[Nash equilibria]] but can be eliminated as incredible threats (as described above) by applying the [[solution concept]] of [[subgame perfection]]. Indeed, it is the very thing that makes a Cournot strategy profile a Nash equilibrium in a Stackelberg game that prevents it from being subgame perfect.

Consider a Stackelberg game (i.e. one which fulfills the requirements described above for sustaining a Stackelberg equilibrium) in which, for some reason, the leader believes that whatever action it takes, the follower will choose a Cournot quantity (perhaps the leader believes that the follower is irrational). If the leader played a Stackelberg action, (it believes) that the follower will play Cournot. Hence it is non-optimal for the leader to play Stackelberg. In fact, its best response (by the definition of Cournot equilibrium) is to play Cournot quantity. Once it has done this, the best response of the follower is to play Cournot.

Consider the following strategy profiles: the leader plays Cournot; the follower plays Cournot if the leader plays Cournot and the follower plays non-Stackelberg if the leader plays Stackelberg and if the leader plays something else, the follower plays an arbitrary strategy (hence this actually describes several profiles). This profile is a Nash equilibrium. As argued above, on the equilibrium path play is a best response to a best response. However, playing Cournot would not have been the best response of the leader were it that the follower would play Stackelberg if it (the leader) played Stackelberg. In this case, the best response of the leader would be to play Stackelberg. Hence, what makes this profile (or rather, these profiles) a Nash equilibrium (or rather, Nash equilibria) is the fact that the follower would play non-Stackelberg if the leader were to play Stackelberg.

However, this very fact (that the follower would play non-Stackelberg if the leader were to play Stackelberg) means that this profile is not a Nash equilibrium of the subgame starting when the leader has already played Stackelberg (a subgame off the equilibrium path). If the leader has already played Stackelberg, the best response of the follower is to play Stackelberg (and therefore it is the only action that yields a Nash equilibrium in this subgame). Hence the strategy profile - which is Cournot - is not subgame perfect.

== Comparison with other oligopoly models ==

In comparison with other oligopoly models,

*The aggregate Stackelberg output is greater than the aggregate [[Cournot competition|Cournot]] output, but less than the aggregate [[Bertrand competition|Bertrand]] output.
*The Stackelberg price is lower than the Cournot price, but greater than the Bertrand price.
*The Stackelberg consumer surplus is greater than the Cournot consumer surplus, but lower than the Bertrand consumer surplus.
*The aggregate Stackelberg output is greater than pure [[monopoly]] or [[cartel]], but less than the perfectly [[competition (economics)|competitive]] output.
*The Stackelberg price is lower than the pure monopoly or cartel price, but greater than the perfectly competitive price.

== Applications ==
The Stackelberg concept has been extended to dynamic Stackelberg games. See Simaan and Cruz (1973a, 1973b). With the addition of time as a dimension, phenomena not found in static games were discovered, such as violation of the principle of optimality by the leader, Simaan and Cruz (1973b).  For a survey of applications of Stackelberg differential games to supply chain and marketing channels, see He et al. (2007). In recent years, Stackelberg games have contributed a lot in the security domain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Gerald|title=Defending critical infrastructure|journal=Interfaces|date=2006|volume=36|issue=6|pages=530–544|DOI=10.1287/inte.1060.0252}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is essential for the security personnel to protect some valuable resource and search for any potential threats to it. This is where it involves the security personnel (leader) to design his/her strategy first so that irrespective of the strategy adopted by the thief (follower), the resource remains safe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2552">In [[mathematics]] and especially in [[algebraic combinatorics]], the '''Stanley symmetric functions''' are a family of [[symmetric polynomial]]s introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Richard P. Stanley|first=Richard|last=Stanley|year=1984}} in his study of the [[symmetric group]] of [[permutation]]s.  

Formally, the Stanley symmetric function ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...) indexed by a permutation ''w'' is defined as a sum of certain [[Quasisymmetric_function#Important_bases|fundamental quasisymmetric functions]].  Each summand corresponds to a reduced decomposition of ''w'', that is, to a way of writing ''w'' as a product of a minimal possible number of [[Transposition (mathematics)|adjacent transpositions]].  They were introduced in the course of Stanley's enumeration of the reduced decompositions of permutations, and in particular his proof that the permutation ''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)...21 (written here in [[one-line notation]]) has exactly
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\binom{n}{2}! }{1^{n - 1} \cdot 3^{n - 2} \cdot 5^{n - 3} \cdots (2n - 3)^1}&lt;/math&gt;
reduced decompositions.  (Here &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{2}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[binomial coefficient]] ''n''(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)/2 and ! denotes the [[factorial]].)

==Properties==

The Stanley symmetric function ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]] with [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] equal to the number of [[inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversions]] of ''w''.  Unlike other nice families of symmetric functions, the Stanley symmetric functions have many linear dependencies and so do not form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the [[ring of symmetric functions]].  When a Stanley symmetric function is expanded in the basis of [[Schur polynomials|Schur functions]], the coefficients are all [[non-negative]] [[integer]]s.

The Stanley symmetric functions have the property that they are the stable limit of [[Schubert polynomials]]
:&lt;math&gt;F_w(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \mathfrak{S}_{1^n \times w}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
where we treat both sides as formal power series, and take the limit coefficientwise.

In [[telecommunication]], a '''two-out-of-five code''' is an [[m of n codes|m of n code]] that provides exactly ten possible combinations, and thus is popular for representing [[decimal digit]]s using five [[bit]]s.  There are ways to assign weights to each bit such that the set bits sum to the desired value, with an exception for zero.

According to [[Federal Standard 1037C]]:
# each decimal [[numerical digit|digit]] is represented by a binary numeral consisting of five bits of which two are of one kind, called ''"ones,"'' and three are of the other kind, called ''"zeros"'', and
# the usual weights assigned to the bit positions are 0-1-2-3-6.  However, in this scheme, [[0 (number)|zero]] is encoded as "binary" 01100; strictly speaking the 0-1-2-3-6 previously claimed is just a [[mnemonic]] device.&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weights give a unique encoding for most digits, but allow two encodings for 3: 0+3 or 10010 and 1+2 or 01100.  The former is used to encode the digit 3, and the latter is used to represent the otherwise unrepresentable zero.

The [[IBM 7070]], [[IBM 7072]], and [[IBM 7074]] computers used this code to represent each of the ten decimal digits in a machine word, although they numbered the bit positions 0-1-2-3-4, rather than with weights.  Each word also had a sign flag, encoded using a two-out-of-three code, that could be '''A''' Alphanumeric, '''−''' Minus, or '''+''' Plus.  When copied to a digit, the three bits were placed in bit positions 0-3-4.  (Thus producing the numeric values 3, 6 and 9, respectively.)

A variant is the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] [[POSTNET]] [[barcode]], used to represent the [[ZIP Code|ZIP+4 code]] for automated mail sorting and routing equipment.  This uses two tall bars as ''"ones"'' and three short bars as ''"zeros"''.  Here, the weights assigned to the bit positions are 7-4-2-1-0.  Again, zero is encoded specially, using the 7+4 combination (binary 11000) that would naturally encode 11.  This method was also used in North American telephone [[Multi-frequency]] and [[crossbar switch]]ing systems.[http://simplethinking.com/photo/phone/vintage/xbr%20relays.shtml]

The USPS [[Postal Alpha Numeric Encoding Technique]] (PLANET) uses the same weights, but with the opposite bar-height convention.

The following table represents [[decimal]] digits from 0 to 9 in various two-out-of-five code systems:

The limit on the number of bits set is similar to, but strictly stronger than, a [[parity check]]. All [[constant-weight code]]s, including the two-out-of-five code, can not only detect any single-bit error, but also detect any [[unidirectional error]]s -- any case where all errors in a codeword are of a single type (0→1 or 1→0).

The developers and users of these models, the decision makers using information obtained from the results of these models, and the individuals affected by decisions based on such models are all rightly concerned with whether a model and its results are "correct".&lt;ref name ="Sargent"&gt;Sargent, Robert G. [http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc11papers/016.pdf "VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF SIMULATION MODELS"]. Proceedings of the 2011 Winter Simulation Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; This concern is addressed through verification and validation of the simulation model.

Simulation models are approximate imitations of real-world systems and they never exactly imitate the real-world system.  Due to that, a model should be verified and validated to the degree needed for the models intended purpose or application.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

The verification and validation of simulation model starts after functional specifications have been documented and initial model development has been completed.&lt;ref name ="Carson" &gt;Carson, John, [http://informs-sim.org/wsc02papers/008.pdf "MODEL VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION"]. Proceedings of the 2002 Winter Simulation Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; Verification and validation is an iterative process that takes place throughout the development of a model.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt;

== Verification ==
In the context of computer simulation, '''verification''' of a model is the process of confirming that it is correctly implemented with respect to the conceptual model (it matches specifications and assumptions deemed acceptable for the given purpose of application).&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt;
During verification the model is tested to find and fix errors in the implementation of the model.&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt;
Various processes and techniques are used to assure the model matches specifications and assumptions with respect to the model concept. 
The objective of model verification is to ensure that the implementation of the model is correct.

There are many techniques that can be utilized to verify a model.
Including, but not limited to, have the model checked by an expert, making logic flow diagrams that include each logically possible action, examining the model output for reasonableness under a variety of settings of the input parameters, and using an interactive debugger.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;
Many software engineering techniques used for [[software verification]] are applicable to simulation model verification.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;

== Validation ==
Validation checks the accuracy of the model's representation of the real system.  Model validation is defined to mean "substantiation that a computerized model within its domain of applicability possesses a satisfactory range of accuracy consistent with the intended application of the model".&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; A model should be built for a specific purpose or set of objectives and its validity determined for that purpose.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

There are many approaches that can be used to validate a computer model.  The approaches range from subjective reviews to objective statistical tests.  One approach that is commonly used is to have the model builders determine validity of the model through a series of tests.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

Naylor and Finger [1967] formulated a three-step approach to model validation that has been widely followed:&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;

Step 1. Build a model that has high face validity.

Step 2. Validate model assumptions.

Step 3. Compare the model input-output transformations to corresponding input-output transformations for the real system.&lt;ref&gt;NAYLOR, T. H., AND J. M. FINGER [1967], [http://mansci.journal.informs.org/content/14/2/B-92 "Verification of Computer Simulation Models"], Management Science, Vol. 2, pp. B92– B101., cited in Banks, Jerry; Carson, John S.; Nelson, Barry L.; Nicol, David M. ''Discrete-Event System Simulation'' Fifth Edition, Upper Saddle River, Pearson Education, Inc. 2010 p. 396. {{ISBN|0136062121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face validity ===
A model that has '''face validity''' appears to be a reasonable imitation of a real-world system to people who are knowledgeable of the real world system.&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt; Face validity is tested by having users and people knowledgeable with the system examine model output for reasonableness and in the process identify deficiencies.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; An added advantage of having the users involved in validation is that the model's credibility to the users and the user's confidence in the model increases.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt; Sensitivity to model inputs can also be used to judge face validity.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; For example, if a simulation of a fast food restaurant drive through was run twice with customer arrival rates of 20 per hour and 40 per hour then model outputs such as average wait time or maximum number of customers waiting would be expected to increase with the arrival rate.

=== Validation of model assumptions ===
Assumptions made about a model generally fall into two categories: structural assumptions about how system works and data assumptions.

==== Structural assumptions ====
Assumptions made about how the system operates and how it is physically arranged are structural assumptions.  For example, the number of servers in a fast food drive through lane and if there is more than one how are they utilized?  Do the servers work in parallel where a customer completes a transaction by visiting a single server or does one server take orders and handle payment while the other prepares and serves the order.  Many structural problems in the model come from poor or incorrect assumptions.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;  If possible the workings of the actual system should be closely observed to understand how it operates.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;  The systems structure and operation should also be verified with users of the actual system.&lt;ref name="Banks" /&gt;

==== Data assumptions ====
There must be a sufficient amount of appropriate data available to build a conceptual model and validate a model.  Lack of appropriate data is often the reason attempts to validate a model fail.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;  Data should be verified to come from a reliable source.  A typical error is assuming an inappropriate statistical distribution for the data.&lt;ref name="Banks" /&gt;  The assumed statistical model should be tested using goodness of fit tests and other techniques.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; Examples of goodness of fit tests are the [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]] and the [[chi-square test]].  Any outliers in the data should be checked.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

=== Validating input-output transformations ===
The model is viewed as an input-output transformation for these tests.  The validation test consists of comparing outputs from the system under consideration to model outputs for the same set of input conditions.  Data recorded while observing the system must be available in order to perform this test.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; The model output that is of primary interest should be used as the measure of performance.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; For example, if system under consideration is a fast food drive through where input to model is customer arrival time and the output measure of performance is average customer time in line, then the actual arrival time and time spent in line for customers at the drive through would be recorded.  The model would be run with the actual arrival times and the model average time in line would be compared with the actual average time spent in line using one or more tests.

==== Hypothesis testing ====
[[Statistical hypothesis testing]] using the [[Student's t-test|t-test]] can be used as a basis to accept the model as valid or reject it as invalid.

The hypothesis to be tested is
:H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the model measure of performance = the system measure of performance
versus
:H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; the model measure of performance ≠ the system measure of performance.

The test is conducted for a given sample size and level of significance or α.  To perform the test a number ''n'' statistically independent runs of the model are conducted and an average or expected value, E(Y), for the variable of interest is produced.  Then the test statistic, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is computed for the given α, ''n'', E(Y) and the observed value for the system  μ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;t_0 = {(E(Y)-u_0)}/{(S/\sqrt{n})}&lt;/math&gt; and the critical value for α and n-1 the degrees of freedom

: &lt;math&gt;t_{a/2,n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is calculated.

If 
: &lt;math&gt; \left\vert t_0 \right\vert &gt; t_{a/2,n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
reject H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the model needs adjustment.

There are two types of error that can occur using hypothesis testing, rejecting a valid model called type I error or "model builders risk" and accepting an invalid model called Type II error, β, or "model user's risk".&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; The level of significance or α is equal the probability of type I error.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; If α is small then rejecting the null hypothesis is a strong conclusion.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; For example, if α = 0.05 and the null hypothesis is rejected there is only a 0.05 probability of rejecting a model that is valid.  Decreasing the probability of a type II error is very important.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; The probability of correctly detecting an invalid model is 1 - β.  The probability of a type II error is dependent of the sample size and the actual difference between the sample value and the observed value.  Increasing the sample size decreases the risk of a type II error.

===== Model accuracy as a range =====
A statistical technique where the amount of model accuracy is specified as a range has recently been developed.  The technique uses hypothesis testing to accept a model if the difference between a model's variable of interest and a system's variable of interest is within a specified range of accuracy.&lt;ref name="Sargent2"&gt;Sargent, R. G. 2010. "A New Statistical Procedure for Validation of Simulation and Stochastic Models." Technical Report SYR-EECS-2010-06, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement is that both the system data and model data be approximately [[Normal distribution|Normally]] [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|Independent and Identically Distributed (NIID)]].  The [[Student's t-test|t-test]] statistic is used in this technique.  If the mean of the model is μ&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; and the mean of system is μ&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; then the difference between the model and the system is D = μ&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; - μ&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;.  The hypothesis to be tested is if D is within the acceptable range of accuracy. Let L = the lower limit for accuracy and U = upper limit for accuracy.  Then

:H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; L ≤ D ≤ U
versus
:H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; D &lt; L or D &gt; U

is to be tested.

The operating characteristic (OC) curve is the probability that the null hypothesis is accepted when it is true.  The OC curve characterizes the probabilities of both type I and II errors.  Risk curves for model builder's risk and model user's can be developed from the OC curves.  Comparing curves with fixed sample size tradeoffs between model builder's risk and model user's risk can be seen easily in the risk curves.&lt;ref name="Sargent2" /&gt; If model builder's risk, model user's risk, and the upper and lower limits for the range of accuracy are all specified then the sample size needed can be calculated.&lt;ref name="Sargent2" /&gt;

==== Confidence intervals ====
Confidence intervals can be used to evaluate if a model is "close enough"&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; to a system for some variable of interest.  The difference between the known model value, μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the system value, μ, is checked to see if it is less than a value small enough that the model is valid with respect that variable of interest.  The value is denoted by the symbol ε.  To perform the test a number, ''n'', statistically independent runs of the model are conducted and a mean or expected value, E(Y) or μ for simulation output variable of interest Y, with a standard deviation ''S'' is produced.  A confidence level is selected, 100(1-α).  An interval, [a,b], is constructed by

: &lt;math&gt;a = E(Y) - t_{a/2,n-1}S/\sqrt{n} \qquad and \qquad b = E(Y) + t_{a/2,n-1}S/\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;,
where 
: &lt;math&gt;t_{a/2,n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
is the critical value from the t-distribution for the given level of significance and n-1 degrees of freedom.
: If |a-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; ε and |b-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; ε then the model needs to be calibrated since in both cases the difference is larger than acceptable.
: If |a-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; ε and |b-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; ε then the model is acceptable as in both cases the error is close enough.
: If |a-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; ε and |b-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; ε or [[vice versa]] then additional runs of the model are needed to shrink the interval.

==== Graphical comparisons ====
If statistical assumptions cannot be satisfied or there is insufficient data for the system a graphical comparisons of model outputs to system outputs can be used to make a subjective decisions, however other objective tests are preferable.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7754">[[Image:Viviani_Theorem.svg|thumb|right|250px|For any interior point P, the sum of the lengths {{nowrap|''s'' + ''u'' + ''t''}}  equals the height of the equilateral triangle.]]
'''Viviani's theorem''', named after [[Vincenzo Viviani]], states that the sum of the distances from ''any'' interior point to the sides of an [[equilateral triangle]] equals the length of the triangle's [[Altitude (triangle)|altitude]].&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=0903.0753|first=Elias|last=Abboud|title=On Viviani's Theorem and its Extensions|journal=College Mathematics Journal|volume=43|issue=3|year=2010|page=16|doi=10.4169/074683410X488683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==
This proof depends on the readily-proved proposition that the area of a triangle is half its base times its height—that is, half the product of one side with the altitude from that side.

Let ABC be an equilateral triangle whose height is ''h'' and whose side is ''a''.

Let P be any point inside the triangle, and ''u, s, t'' the distances of P from the sides. Draw a line from P to each of A, B, and C, forming three triangles PAB, PBC, and PCA.

Now, the areas of these triangles are &lt;math&gt;\frac{u \cdot a}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{s \cdot a}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\frac{t \cdot a}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  They exactly fill the enclosing triangle, so  the sum of these areas is equal to the area of the enclosing triangle.
So we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{u \cdot a}{2} + \frac{s \cdot a}{2} + \frac{t \cdot a}{2} = \frac{h \cdot a}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and thus

:''u + s + t = h.''

[[Q.E.D.]]

==Converse==

The converse also holds: If the sum of the distances from an interior point of a triangle to the sides is independent of the location of the point, the triangle is equilateral.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Zhibo|last2=Liang|first2=Tian|title=The converse of Viviani's theorem|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=37|issue=5|pages=390–391|year=2006|doi=10.2307/27646392|jstor=27646392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
[[Image:Flammability diagram methane.svg|right|thumb|400px|[[Flammability diagram]] for methane]]
{{details|Ternary plot}}

Viviani's theorem means that lines parallel to the sides of an equilateral triangle give coordinates for making [[ternary plot]]s, such as [[flammability diagram]]s.

More generally, they allow one to give coordinates on a regular [[simplex]] in the same way.

==Extensions==

===Parallelogram===

The sum of the distances from any interior point of a [[parallelogram]] to the sides is independent of the location of the point. The converse also holds: If the sum of the distances from a point in the interior of a [[quadrilateral]] to the sides is independent of the location of the point, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.&lt;ref name=Chen/&gt;

The result generalizes to any 2''n''-gon with opposite sides parallel. Since the sum of distances between any pair of opposite parallel sides is constant, it follows that the sum of all pairwise sums between the pairs of parallel sides, is also constant. The converse in general is not true, as the result holds for an ''equilateral'' hexagon, which does not necessarily have opposite sides parallel.

===Regular polygon===

If a polygon is [[regular polygon|regular]] (both equiangular and [[equilateral polygon|equilateral]]), the sum of the distances to the sides from an interior point is independent of the location of the point. Specifically, it equals ''n'' times the [[apothem]], where ''n'' is the number of sides and the apothem is the distance from the center to a side.&lt;ref name=Chen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pickover|first=Clifford A.|title=The Math Book|publisher=Stirling|year=2009|page=150|isbn=978-1402788291}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the converse does not hold; the non-square parallelogram is a counterexample.&lt;ref name=Chen/&gt;

===Equiangular polygon===

The sum of the distances from an interior point to the sides of an [[equiangular polygon]] does not depend on the location of the point.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Convex polygon===

A necessary and sufficient condition for a convex polygon to have a constant sum of distances from any interior point to the sides is that there exist three non-collinear interior points with equal sums of distances.&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt;

===Regular polyhedron===

The sum of the distances from any point in the interior of a [[regular polyhedron]] to the sides is independent of the location of the point. However, the converse does not hold, not even for [[tetrahedra]].&lt;ref name=Chen/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4422">'''William of Soissons''' was a French [[logician]] who lived in [[Paris]] in the 12th century. He belonged to a school of logicians, called the [[Parvipontians]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Graham Priest, 'What's so bad about contradictions?' in Priest, Beal and Armour-Garb, ''The law of non-contradicton'', p. 25, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soissons fundamental logical problem and solution ==

William of Soissons seems to have been the first one to answer the question, "Why is a contradiction not accepted in logic reasoning?" by the [[Principle of Explosion]]. Exposing a contradiction was already in the ancient days of [[Plato]] a way of showing that some reasoning was wrong, but there was no explicit argument as to why contradictions were incorrect. William of Soissons gave a proof in which he showed that from a contradiction any assertion can be inferred as true.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In example from:  ''It is raining (P) and  it is not raining (¬P)''   you may infer   ''that there are trees on the moon (or whatever else)(E)''. In symbolic language: P &amp; ¬P → E.

If a contradiction makes anything true then it makes it impossible to say anything meaningful: whatever you say, its contradiction is also true.

== Lewis's reconstruction of his proof ==

William's contemporairies compared his proof with a siege engine (12th century).&lt;ref&gt;Kneale and Kneale, ''The development of logic'', Clarendon Press Oxford, 1978, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1800s, [[Clarence Irving Lewis]] formalized this proof as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Martin, William’s Machine, ''Journal of Philosophy'', 83, 1986, pp. 564 – 572. In particular p. 565&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof'''

V    : or
&amp;    : and
→    : inference
P    : proposition
¬ P  : denial of P
P &amp;¬ P : contradiction.
E      : any possible assertion (Explosion).

 (1) P &amp;¬ P → P         (If P and ¬ P are both true then P is true)
 (2) P → P∨E            (If P is true then P or E is true)
 (3) P &amp;¬ P → P∨E       (If P and ¬ P are both true the P or E are true (from (2))
 (4) P &amp;¬ P → ¬P        (If P and ¬ P are both true then ¬P is true)
 (5) P &amp;¬ P → (P∨E) &amp;¬P (If P and ¬ P are both true then (P∨E) is true (from (3)) and ¬P is true (from (4)))
 (6) (P∨E) &amp;¬P → E      (If (P∨E) is true and ¬P is true then E is true)
 (7) P &amp;¬ P → E         (From (5) and (6) one after the other follows (7))

== Acceptance and criticism in later ages ==

In the 15th century this proof was rejected by a school in [[Cologne]]. They didn't accept step (6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-paraconsistent/#BrieHistExContQuod |title=Paraconsistent Logic (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 19th-century [[classical logic]], the Principle of Explosion was widely accepted as self-evident, e.g. by logicians like [[George Boole]] and [[Gottlob Frege]], though the formalization of the Soissons proof by Lewis provided additional grounding the Principle of Explosion.

== Appendix: A way of rejecting the proof ==

The above proof can be rejected as is shown below. &lt;ref&gt;A more a less similar rejection of the Soissons/Lewis proof can be found on the Talkpage of [[Principle of Explosion]]. (chapter 3)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Take the proof above and unpack the justification for line (6), taking it to rely on (6*):

 (1) .................
 (2) .................
 (3) .................
 (4) .................
  
 (5) P &amp;¬ P → (P∨E) &amp;¬P 
 (6) (P∨E) &amp;¬P  → (P &amp;¬ P) V(¬P&amp;E) 
 
Now only if (P &amp;¬ P) is rejected as invalid E can be inferred:

 (7*) (P∨E) &amp;¬P  → (¬P&amp;E)  
 (8*) (P∨E) &amp;¬P  → E

From (5) and (8*) follows:

 (9*) P &amp;¬ P → E  

On this reconstruction, only by rejecting (P &amp;¬ P) can E be concluded. So, if (P &amp;¬ P) is not rejected E cannot be concluded. But (P &amp;¬ P) can in this proof only be rejected if E is valid. So this proof is a [[vicious circle]]. 

(Rejecting this Soissons/Lewis proof does not reject the Principle of Explosion. Therefore a counterexample, in which is shown a contradiction which is not invalid, would do. &lt;ref&gt; Graham Priest shows counterexamples in Graham Priest, ''Logic A very short introduction '', Chapter 5, Oxford University Press, 2017. &lt;/ref&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="878">In algebra, '''Zariski's finiteness theorem''' gives a positive answer to [[Hilbert's 14th problem]] for the polynomial ring in two variables, as a special case.&lt;ref&gt;http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~ddaigle/articles/H14survey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Precisely, it states:
:Given a [[normal domain]] ''A'', finitely generated as an algebra over a field ''k'', if ''L'' is a subfield of the field of fractions of ''A'' containing ''k'' such that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr.deg}_k(L) \le 2&lt;/Math&gt;, then the ''k''-subalgebra &lt;math&gt;L \cap A&lt;/math&gt; is finitely generated.
