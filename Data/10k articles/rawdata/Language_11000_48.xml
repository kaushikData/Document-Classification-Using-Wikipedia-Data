      <comment>/* Vowels */ Of course, but my question was which allophone belongs to which of the vowel phonemes. So I'm guessing that [e] belongs to /a/ and [i] belongs to /ɨ ~ ə/ (and so on).</comment>

{{IPA notice}}

[[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] is a language of the [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian family]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= J. C. |last= Catford |title= Mountain of Tongues: The Languages of the Caucasus|journal =Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=6 |pages=283&amp;ndash; 314 |date=1977 |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2949334?uid=3738256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102596747473 |doi=10.1146/annurev.an.06.100177.001435}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, like the other Northwest Caucasian languages, is very rich in consonants. Abkhaz has a large consonantal inventory that contrasts 58 consonants in the literary [[Abzhywa Abkhaz|Abzhywa]] dialect, coupled with just two phonemic vowels ({{harvcolnb|Chirikba|2003|pp=18–20}}).

Abkhaz has three major dialects, Abzhywa, [[Bzyp Abkhaz|Bzyp]] and [[Sadz Abkhaz|Sadz]], which differ mainly in phonology.

Phonemes preceded by an '''asterisk''' (&lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;) are found in the Bzyp and Sadz dialects of Abkhaz, but not in Abzhywa; phonemes preceded by a '''dagger''' (&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;†&lt;/span&gt;) are unique to the Bzyp dialect. The total number of consonant phonemes in Abkhaz is, therefore, 58 in the Abzhywa dialect, 60 in the Sadz dialect, and 67 in Bzyp. The Sadz dialect also has distinctive consonant [[gemination]]; for example, Sadz Abkhaz contrasts {{IPA|/a.χʷa/}} ('ashes') vs. {{IPA|/a.χʷːa/}} ('worm'), where Abzhywa and Bzyp Abkhaz have only the one form {{IPA|/a.χʷa/}} for both; it seems that many Sadz singletons reflect positions where a consonant has been dropped from the beginning of a cluster in the Proto-Northwest Caucasian form (compare [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]] {{IPA|/tχʷa/}} 'ashes'). Some scholars (for instance, {{harvcolnb|Chirikba|2003}}) prefer to count the Sadz consonant inventory at well over 100 (thus forming the largest consonant inventory in the Caucasus, outstripping Ubykh's 80–84) by treating the geminated consonants as a set in their own right. (Note, however, that this practice is not usual in counting the consonant inventory of a language.)

The Bzyp consonant inventory appears to have been the fundamental inventory of Proto-Abkhaz, with the inventories of Abzhywa and Sadz being reduced from this total, rather than the Bzyp series being innovative. Plain alveolopalatal affricates and fricatives have merged with their corresponding alveolars in Abzhywa and Sadz Abkhaz (compare Bzyp {{IPA|/a.t͡ɕʼa.ra/}} 'to know' vs. Abzhywa {{IPA|/a.t͡sʼa.ra/}}), and in Abzhywa the labialised alveolopalatal fricatives have merged with the corresponding postalveolars (compare Bzyp {{IPA|/a.ɕʷa.ra/}} 'to measure' vs. Abzhywa {{IPA|/a.ʃʷa.ra/}}).

The non-pharyngealised dorsal fricatives of Abkhaz may be realised as either velar or uvular depending upon the context in which they are found; here, they have been ranged with the uvulars. Also, while the [[labialised palatal approximant]] {{IPA|/ɥ/}} is here placed with the approximants, it is actually the reflex of a labialised [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]], preserved in [[Abaza language|Abaza]], and a legacy of this phoneme's origin is a slight constriction of the pharynx for some speakers, resulting in the phonetic realisation {{IPA|[ɥˤ]}}.

==Vowels==
Abkhaz has only two distinctive vowels: an open vowel {{IPA|/a/}} and a close vowel {{IPA|/ɨ ~ ə/}}. These basic vowels have a wide range of [[allophone]]s in different consonantal environments, with allophones {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[i]}} respectively next to [[palatal]]s, {{IPA|[o]}} and {{IPA|[u]}} next to [[labial consonant|labials]], and {{IPA|[ø]}} and {{IPA|[y]}} next to labiopalatals. {{IPA|/a/}} also has a long variant {{IPA|/aː/}}, which is the reflex of old sequences of {{IPA|*/ʕa/}} or {{IPA|*/aʕ/}}, preserved in Abaza.

{{Expand Dutch|Bargoens|date=June 2018}}
'''''Bargoens''''' {{IPA-nl|bɑrˈɣuns|}} is a form of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] [[slang]], more specifically, it is a [[Cant (language)|cant]] language that arose in the 17th century, and was used by criminals, tramps and travelling salesmen as a secret code, like Spain's ''[[Germanía]]'' or French ''[[Argot]]''. 

However, the word ''Bargoens'' usually refers to the [[thieves' cant]] spoken in the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. The actual slang varied greatly from place to place; often ''Bargoens'' denotes the variety from the [[Holland|Holland region]] in the [[Netherlands]]. While many words from Bargoens have faded into obscurity, others have become part of standard Dutch (but are more often used in the "Hollandic" than in other Dutch dialects). ''Hufter'' (jerk), ''gappen'' (to steal) and ''poen'' (money) are examples of words now common in Dutch. As is the case for most thieves' languages, many of the words from ''Bargoens'' are either insults or concern money, crime or sex.

Due to the historically large number of [[Jews in Amsterdam]], Bargoens has many [[Yiddish]] [[loanword]]s. Examples are ''sjacheren'' (to barter), ''mesjogge'' (crazy), ''jatten'' (hands, to steal), ''gabber'' (buddy, friend), ''tof'' (great), ''hachelen'' (to eat).

The name of this cant is close to ''baragouin'', which means "[[jargon]]" in [[French language|French]]. It is supposed to have been derived either from the Breton words ''bara+gwin'' (bread+wine) or from ''Bourgondisch'' ('Burgundish', i.e. [the language] from Burgundy).

'''Bokmål''' (literally "book tongue") is an official written standard for the [[Norwegian language]], alongside [[Nynorsk]]. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90%&lt;ref name="Vikor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprakrad.no/Tema/Fakta/ |author=Vikør, Lars|authorlink=Lars Vikør|title=''Fakta om norsk språk''|accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the population in [[Norway]]. Unlike for instance the [[Italian language]], there is no nationwide standard or agreement on the pronunciation of Bokmål.

Bokmål is regulated by the governmental [[Norwegian Language Council]]. A more conservative [[orthography|orthographic]] standard, commonly known as ''[[Riksmål]]'', is regulated by the non-governmental [[Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature]]. The written standard is a Norwegianised variety of the [[Danish language]].

The first Bokmål [[orthography]] was officially adopted in 1907 under the name ''Riksmål'' after being under development since 1879.&lt;ref name="Lundeby"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprakradet.no/nb-no/Politikk-Fakta/Fakta/Andre_oversikter/Stortinget_og_spraaksaken/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130222201525/http://www.sprakradet.no/nb-no/Politikk-Fakta/Fakta/Andre_oversikter/Stortinget_og_spraaksaken/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-02-22|author=Lundeby, Einar|authorlink=Einar Lundeby|title=''Stortinget og språksaken''|accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architects behind the reform were [[Marius Nygaard (academic)|Marius Nygaard]] and Jacob Jonathan Aars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Marius Nygaard|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Eyvind Fjeld|last=Halvorsen|authorlink=Eyvind Fjeld Halvorsen|volume=|editor=Helle, Knut|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Marius_Nygaard/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=6 February 2010|editor-link=Knut Helle}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an adaptation of written Danish, which was commonly used since the past union with [[Denmark]], to the Dano-Norwegian [[koiné language|koiné]] spoken by the Norwegian urban elite, especially in the capital. When the large conservative newspaper ''[[Aftenposten]]'' adopted the 1907 orthography in 1923, Danish writing was practically out of use in Norway. The name ''Bokmål'' was officially adopted in 1929 after a proposition to call the written language ''Dano-Norwegian'' lost by a single vote in the [[Storting|Lagting]] (a chamber in the Norwegian parliament).&lt;ref name="Lundeby"/&gt;

The government does not regulate ''spoken'' Bokmål and recommends that normalised pronunciation should follow the [[phonology]] of the speaker's local dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprakradet.no/Sprakhjelp/Raad/Raad_om_uttale/|title=Råd om uttale|accessdate=2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there is a spoken variety of Norwegian that, in the region of [[Østlandet|South-Eastern Norway]], is commonly seen as the ''de facto'' standard for spoken Bokmål. In ''The Phonology of Norwegian'', Gjert Kristoffersen writes that

{{quote|Bokmål [...] is in its most common variety looked upon as reflecting formal middle-class urban speech, especially that found in the eastern part of Southern Norway [sic], with the capital Oslo as the obvious centre. One can therefore say that Bokmål has a spoken realisation that one might call an unofficial standard spoken Norwegian. It is in fact often referred to as Standard Østnorsk ('Standard East Norwegian').&lt;ref name="Kristoffersen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kristoffersen|first=Gjert|authorlink=Gjert Kristoffersen|title=The Phonology of Norwegian|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-19-823765-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Standard Østnorsk (Standard East Norwegian) is the pronunciation most commonly given in dictionaries and taught to foreigners in Norwegian language classes.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Standard Østnorsk as a spoken language is not used and does not have any particular prestige outside South-Eastern Norway. All spoken variations of the Norwegian language are used e.g. in the [[Storting]] and in Norwegian national broadcasters such as [[NRK]] and [[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]], even in cases where the conventions of Bokmål are used. The spoken variation typically reflects the region the person grew up in.

== History ==
Up until about 1300, the written language of [[Norway]], [[Old Norwegian]], was essentially the same as the other [[Old Norse#Dialects|Old Norse dialects]]. The speech, however, was gradually differentiated into local and regional dialects. As long as Norway remained an independent kingdom, the written language remained essentially constant.&lt;ref name="Haugen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haugen |first=Einar|title=Norwegian English Dictionary|publisher=Unifersitetsforlaget |location=Oslo |year=1977|isbn=0-299-03874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1380,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Norway entered into a [[personal union]] with Denmark. By the early 16th century, Norway had lost its separate political institutions, and together with Denmark formed the political unit known as [[Denmark–Norway]] until 1814, progressively becoming the weaker member of the union.{{cn|date=May 2016}} During this period, the modern Danish and Norwegian languages emerged. Norwegian went through a [[Middle Norwegian]] transition, and a Danish written language more heavily influenced by [[Low German]] was gradually standardised. This process was aided by the [[Reformation]], which prompted [[Christiern Pedersen]]'s translation of the Bible into Danish. Remnants of written Old Norse and Norwegian were thus displaced by the Danish standard, which became used for virtually all administrative documents.&lt;ref name="Haugen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gjerset"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gjerset |first=Knut |title=History of the Norwegian People, Volumes I &amp; II|publisher=The MacMillan Company|year=1915|ISBN=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Norwegians used Danish primarily in writing, but it gradually came to be spoken by urban elites on formal or official occasions. Although Danish never became the spoken language of the vast majority of the population, by the time Norway's ties with Denmark were severed in 1814, a [[Dano-Norwegian]] vernacular often called the "educated daily speech"{{cn|date=May 2016}} had become the mother tongue of elites in most Norwegian cities, such as [[Bergen]], [[Kristiania]] and [[Trondheim]]. This Dano-Norwegian ''[[Koiné language|koiné]]'' could be described as Danish with regional Norwegian pronunciation (see [[Norwegian dialects]]), some Norwegian vocabulary, and simplified grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoel |first=Oddmund Løkensgard |title=Nasjonalisme i norsk målstrid 1848–1865 |url=http://www.krundalen.no/blogg/?page_id=101 |location=Oslo |year=1996 |publisher=Noregs Forskingsråd |isbn=82-12-00695-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Knudknudsen.jpg|thumb|upright|Knud Knudsen, often called the "father of Bokmål".]]

With the gradual subsequent process of Norwegianisation of the written language used in the cities of Norway, from Danish to Bokmål and Riksmål, the upper-class [[sociolects]] in the cities changed accordingly. In 1814, when Norway was ceded from Denmark to Sweden, Norway defied Sweden and her allies, declared independence and adopted a democratic constitution. Although compelled to submit to a dynastic union with Sweden, this spark of independence continued to burn, influencing the evolution of language in Norway. Old language traditions were revived by the patriotic poet [[Henrik Wergeland]] (1808–1845), who championed an independent non-Danish written language.&lt;ref name="Gjerset"/&gt; Haugen indicates that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Within the first generation of liberty, two solutions emerged and won adherents, one based on the speech of the upper class and one on that of the common people. The former called for Norwegianisation of the Danish writing, the latter for a brand new start."&lt;ref name="Haugen"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The more conservative of the two language transitions was advanced by the work of writers like [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen|Peter Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]], schoolmaster and agitator for language reform [[Knud Knudsen (linguist)|Knud Knudsen]], and Knudsen's famous disciple, [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]], as well as a more cautious Norwegianisation by [[Henrik Ibsen]].&lt;ref name="Haugen" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Larsen"&gt;{{cite book|author=Larson, Karen |title=A History of Norway|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Knudsen's work on language reform in the mid-19th century was important for the 1907 orthography and a subsequent reform in 1917, so much so that he is now often called the "father of Bokmål".

== Controversy ==
{{Main|Norwegian language conflict}}

===Riksmål vs. Bokmål===
[[File:Poster against mandatory Samnorsk, 1955.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster from a campaign against mandatory {{Interlanguage link multi|Samnorsk|no}}, circa 1955.]]

The term ''Riksmål'', meaning ''National Language'', was first proposed by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson in 1899 as a name for the Norwegian variety of written Danish as well as spoken Dano-Norwegian. It was borrowed from Denmark where it denoted standard written and spoken Danish. The same year the Riksmål movement became organised under his leadership in order to fight against the growing influence of Nynorsk, eventually leading to the foundation of the [[non-governmental organisation]] [[Riksmålsforbundet]] in 1907. Bjørnson became Riksmålsforbundet's first leader until his death in 1910.

The 1917 reform introduced some elements from [[Norwegian dialects]] and Nynorsk as optional alternatives to traditional Dano-Norwegian forms. This was part of an official policy to bring the two Norwegian languages more closely together, intending eventually to merge them into one. These changes met resistance from the Riksmål movement, and ''Riksmålsvernet'' (The Society for the Protection of Riksmål) was founded in 1919.

The 1938 reform in Bokmål introduced more elements from dialects and Nynorsk, and more importantly, many traditional Dano-Norwegian forms were excluded. This so-called ''radical'' Bokmål or ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Samnorsk|no}}'' (Common Norwegian) met even stiffer resistance from the Riksmål movement, culminating in the 1950s under the leadership of [[Arnulf Øverland]]. Riksmålsforbundet organised a parents' campaign against Samnorsk in 1951, and the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature was founded in 1953. Because of this resistance, the 1959 reform was relatively modest, and the radical reforms were partially reverted in 1981 and 2005.

Currently, Riksmål denotes the moderate, chiefly{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} pre-1938, unofficial variant of Bokmål, which is still in use and is regulated by the Norwegian Academy and promoted by Riksmålsforbundet. Riksmål has gone through some spelling reforms, but none as profound as the ones that shaped Bokmål. A Riksmål dictionary was published in four volumes in the period 1937 to 1957 by Riksmålsvernet, and two supplementary volumes were published in 1995 by the Norwegian Academy. After the latest Bokmål reforms, the difference between Bokmål and Riksmål have diminished and they are now comparable to [[American and British English differences]], but the Norwegian Academy still upholds its own standard.

Norway's most popular daily newspaper, ''[[Aftenposten]]'', is notable for its use of Riksmål as its standard language. Use of Riksmål is rigorously pursued, even with regard to readers' letters, which are "translated" into the standard.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Terminology===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
[[File:Målformer i Norge.svg|thumb|right|200px|Map of the official language forms of Norwegian municipalities. Red is Bokmål, blue is [[Nynorsk]] and gray depicts neutral areas.]]In the Norwegian discourse, the term ''Dano-Norwegian'' is seldom used with reference to contemporary Bokmål and its spoken varieties. The nationality of the language has been a hotly debated topic, and its users and proponents have generally not been fond of the implied association with Danish (hence the neutral names ''Riksmål'' and ''Bokmål'', meaning ''state language'' and ''book language'' respectively). The debate intensified with the advent of [[Nynorsk]] in the 19th century, a written language based on rural [[Modern Norwegian]] dialects and [[Linguistic purism|puristic]] opposition to the Danish and Dano-Norwegian spoken in Norwegian cities.

===Differences from the traditional Oslo dialect===
Most natives of Oslo today speak a dialect that is an amalgamation of vikværsk (which is the technical term for the traditional dialects in the Oslofjord area) and written Danish; and subsequently Riksmål and Bokmål, which primarily inherited their non-Oslo elements from Danish. The present day Oslo dialect is also influenced by other Eastern Norwegian dialects.&lt;ref name="Kristoffersen"/&gt;

The following table shows some important cases where traditional Bokmål and Standard Østnorsk followed Danish rather than the traditional Oslo dialect as it is commonly portrayed in literature about Norwegian dialects.&lt;ref name="Kristoffersen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skjekkeland |first=Martin |title=Dei norske dialektane |publisher=Høyskoleforlaget |year=1997 |isbn=82-7634-103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many of these cases, radical Bokmål follows the traditional Oslo dialect and Nynorsk, and these forms are also given.

'''Misspellings in German''' are a subcategory of orthographical errors (German: ''Rechtschreibfehler''), counter the rules of [[German orthography]]. Although there is some variance following the current 'optional' status of the [[German spelling reform of 1996]].

Misspelling in German is less common than in English since most words are spelled as they are pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;Commonsense Grammar and Style: The Textbook - Phillip S. Sparks - 2004 - Page 65 "In many other languages, German and Spanish for example, almost all words are easy to spell because they are written "&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions however occur, as for the (in modern German) identical "ä" and "e" both representing the IPA [ε] sound.&lt;ref&gt;Learning to Spell: Research, Theory, and Practice Across Languages -  Charles A. Perfetti, Laurence Rieben, Michel Fayol - 1997 Page 86 "Why vowel spelling proved difficult for some of the German words is easy to understand from the misspellings listed in Table 5.1. In the case of Bär (only 66% correct), 25 children used e for /ε/. The letter e actually is the more common spelling ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Confusion can also occur with homonyms as verb prefixes: ''wiederspiegeln'' (incorrect) vs. ''widerspiegeln'' (correct).

'''Misspellings of German words''', outside Germany, also occur - for example by [[Bram Stoker]]&lt;ref&gt;Roman in Englisch-deutscher Perspektiven Susanne Stark - 2000   Page 239 "Conclusion Although misspelling of German terms, such as "Todten" in Dracula and Draculas Guest, as well as "Pinacotek", "Wehrwolf and "Gelegenbeiten" for " Gelegenheiten" in the "Working Notes",67 suggest that Stoker was perhaps not ...&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref&gt;John Gordon Finnegans Wake: A Plot Summary -1986 Page 20 "'Clubsessel' (559.06), the peculiar misspelling of German klubsessel — ' easychair' — puts it within echoing distance of 'closestool', a term (current in Bloom's day — Ulysses 179, 709) for a commode; though dubious, the innuendo seems ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14298">"'''Contempt of cop'''" is [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] [[jargon]] in the [[United States]] for behavior by people towards [[law enforcement officer]]s that the officers perceive as disrespectful or insufficiently deferential to their authority.&lt;ref&gt;Baruch et al., [https://books.google.com/books?id=VrVz3Ha_SAoC&amp;pg=PA140 140].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjdeQTU7th0C&amp;pg=PA55 55].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steverson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BZ1TsIXk-n8C&amp;pg=PA300 300].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTU4MGE4MDkwYzhiYjY4OTk2OWRlZjcyMWY0MjFkNmE= |title=Promoting Racial Paranoia |first= Heather |last = Mac Donald  |format= |work= National Review Online |accessdate=2009-07-26|date=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a play on the phrase ''[[contempt of court]]'', and not an actual offense. The phrase is associated with unlawful [[arbitrary arrest and detention]] of individuals, often for expressing or exercising rights guaranteed to them by the United States Constitution.  Contempt of cop is often discussed in connection to [[police misconduct]] such as use of [[excessive force]] or even [[police brutality]]&lt;ref name="Lawrence 48"&gt;Lawrence, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yQC3rLsqiygC&amp;pg=PA48 48].&lt;/ref&gt; as a reaction to perceived disrespectful behavior&lt;ref&gt;Walker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjdeQTU7th0C&amp;pg=PA52 52].&lt;/ref&gt; rather than for any legitimate law enforcement purpose.&lt;ref name="Collins 51"&gt;Collins, [https://books.google.com/books?id=htGP6WGvOREC&amp;pg=PA51 51]&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrests for contempt of cop may stem from a type of "occupational arrogance" when a police officer thinks his or her authority cannot or should not be challenged or questioned.&lt;ref name=NJ&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aele.org/NJAG799.html |title=New Jersey Final Attorney General Report on racial profiling | first1=John J., Jr. |last1=Farmer | authorlink=John Farmer, Jr.| first2= Paul H. | last2=Zoubek|work=State Police Review Team |date=1999-07-02 |accessdate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From such officers' perspective, contempt of cop may involve perceived or actual challenges to their authority, including a lack of [[deference]] (such as disobeying instructions,&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, [https://books.google.com/books?id=neq8l3vBVYwC&amp;pg=PA119 119].&lt;/ref&gt; or expressing interest in filing a complaint against the officer).&lt;ref name="Collins 51" /&gt; Fleeing from the police is sometimes considered a variant of contempt of cop.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjdeQTU7th0C&amp;pg=PA153 153].&lt;/ref&gt; Contempt of cop situations may be exacerbated if other officers witness the allegedly contemptuous behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/07/26/obamas_henry_gates-gate_97623.html |title= Obama's Henry Gates-gate |first = Clarence |last=Page|authorlink=Clarence Page|work= [[Real Clear Politics]]|date=2009-07-26 |accessdate=2009-07-26|quote=Maybe so, but, according to Crowley, Gate[s] was yelling at him in front of his fellow police officers. In long-standing police-civilian etiquette, that's 'contempt of cop.' You disrespect the police officer, the officer has ways of showing you that he has a longer billy club.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charges such as [[disorderly conduct]], [[resisting arrest]], [[fleeing from police]] and [[assault]]ing an officer may be cited as official reasons in a contempt of cop arrest.&lt;ref name="Collins 51" /&gt; [[Obstructing a police officer]] or [[failure to obey a police order]] is also cited in arrests in some jurisdictions, particularly as a stand-alone charge without any other charges brought.&lt;ref name=PI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilham&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.policeone.com/police-products/duty-gear/restraints/articles/1760130-N-M-cops-cant-arrest-for-refusing-to-obey/ |title=N.M. cops can't arrest for 'refusing to obey' |format= |work= PoliceOne.com|agency=[[Albuquerque Journal]]| first= T.J. | last=Wilham |accessdate=2009-07-27 |date=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
[[Freedom of speech]] is protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], so non-threatening verbal "abuse" of a police officer is not in itself criminal behavior,&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1912777,00.html |title=The Gates Case: When Disorderly Conduct is a Cop's Judgment Call | first = Bonnie | last = Rochman |work= TIME|date=2009-07-26| accessdate=2009-07-26|quote=&amp;nbsp;'In contempt of court, you get loud and abusive in a courtroom, and it's against the law,' says [Jon] Shane, now a professor of criminal justice at John Jay who specializes in police policy and practice. 'With contempt of cop, you get loud and nasty and show scorn for a law enforcement officer, but a police officer can't go out and lock you up for disorderly conduct because you were disrespectful toward them.' The First Amendment allows you to say pretty much anything to the police. 'You could tell them to go f--k themselves,' says Shane, 'and that's fine.'&amp;nbsp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Houston v. Hill"&gt;
Writing for the Court in ''[http://openjurist.org/482/us/451 City of Houston v. Hill]'', {{ussc|482|451|1987}}, [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|Justice Brennan]] said, "The freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state." —&amp;nbsp;482 U.S. 451, at 463&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duran v. Douglas"&gt;
In ''[http://openjurist.org/904/f2d/1372 Duran v. City of Douglas]'', 904 F.2d 1372 (9th Circuit, 1990) the Court held that giving a police officer the "finger" was protected speech. Writing for the Court, [[Alex Kozinski|Judge Kozinski]] said, "But disgraceful as Duran's behavior may have been, it was not illegal;  criticism of the police is not a crime."&lt;/ref&gt; though some courts have disagreed on what constitutes protected speech in this regard.&lt;ref name="Hudson"&gt;
Some lower courts have considered certain speech to constitute [[fighting words]]. See, e.g., {{cite web | url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/speech/personal/topic.aspx?topic=fighting_words |author=David L. Hudson Jr |title=Fighting words | publisher = First Amendment Center | location = Nashville, TN|accessdate=2009-07-26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 2004 the U.S. Supreme Court, without ruling on the merits, allowed to stand a [[Montana Supreme Court]] ruling that unprovoked profane utterances to a county deputy constituted fighting words. See:{{cite web |url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=13272 |title=Supreme Court won't hear dispute over cursing at cops |format= |publisher=First Amendment Center |accessdate=2009-07-27|quote=Today the justices declined without comment to review his appeal in Robinson v. Montana. Their refusal does not address the merits of the issue. By declining to hear Robinson's appeal, justices left undisturbed a Montana Supreme Court ruling that unprovoked utterances are not protected.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled [[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire|in 1942]] that [[fighting words]] that "tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace" are not protected speech, but later cases have interpreted this narrowly,&lt;ref name=SF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/08/08/MN191833.DTL |title=Swearing at police is criticism, not crime / Appeals court overturns 2 convictions |first=Bob |last=Egelko |format= |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2001-08-08|accessdate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in relation to law enforcement officers.&lt;ref name="U.S.A. v. Nolan L. Poocha"&gt;
In ''[http://openjurist.org/259/f3d/1077/united-states-of-america-v-nolan-l-poocha United States v. Poocha]'', 259 F.3d 1077 (9th Cir. 2001), Judge [[Stephen Reinhardt]] wrote for the 2-1 majority that, "criticism of the police, profane or otherwise, is not a crime."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a federal appeals court ruled that [[Finger (gesture)|giving the finger]] "alone cannot establish [[probable cause]] to believe a disorderly conduct violation has occurred".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NY court: Flipping finger at cops not worth arrest|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57561978/ny-court-flipping-finger-at-cops-not-worth-arrest/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racial aspects&lt;!--linked from [[Driving while black]]--&gt;==
The ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' conducted a study in 2008 that found that in the city of [[Seattle]], "African-Americans were arrested for the sole crime of [[obstruction of justice|obstructing]] eight times as often as whites when population is taken into account."&lt;ref name=PI&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/353020_obstructmain28.asp |title=Blacks are arrested on 'contempt of cop' charge at higher rate |first1=Eric |last1=Nalder |first2=Lewis |last2=Kamb |first3=Daniel |last3=Lathrop|format= |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=2008-02-28|accessdate=2009-07-26|quote=The P-I treated an obstructing arrest as "stand-alone" if that was the only charge or if all other charges were for closely related offenses, such as resisting arrest. The number of black men who faced stand-alone obstructing charges during the six-year period reviewed is equal to nearly 2 percent of Seattle's black male population.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the [[New Jersey Attorney General]] also found a significant number of contempt of cop cases while investigating [[racial profiling]] by the [[New Jersey State Police]], and concluded that "improper attitude and demeanor" of officers toward the public was a nationwide problem.&lt;ref name=NJ/&gt;

==Terminology==
''Contempt of cop'' has been in use since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Lawrence 48" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cashmore, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EfINAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA180 180].&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''cop'' is slang for ''police officer''; the phrase is derived by analogy from ''[[contempt of court]]'', which, unlike contempt of cop, is an offense in many jurisdictions (e.g., California Penal Code section 166, making contempt of court a misdemeanor).  Similar to this is the phrase "disturbing the police", a play on "disturbing the peace".  It has also been referred to as "flunking the attitude test".&lt;ref name="books.google.ch"&gt;Coleman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pU-h7wulivMC&amp;pg=PA136 136].&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas it is called P.O.P. (for "Pissing Off the Police") when a suspect's demeanor influences officer's response to people. "Leniency might be afforded to persons who treat officers with respect, whereas the heavy hand of the law is extended to persons who are disrespectful, ill mannered or rude."&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Christine. Introduction to Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice. Delmar Cengage Learning. 2012. 10th edition. Pg 281. {{ISBN|978-1-111-30908-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In crime writing and works about police misconduct, it has become something of a [[cliché]] to [[sardonically]] refer to contempt of cop as the worst possible crime.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Jeffrey Goldberg]] reviewing ''[[New York's Finest]]'' in the [https://books.google.com/books?id=CGV-sHezvSgC&amp;pg=PA1657 September 17, 2000 ''New York Times'']: "[The officer] was simply giving voice to one of the immutable beliefs of the New York City police officer, that contempt of cop, as it is called, is the worst crime of all"; Coady et al. at [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y35K0lamdFYC&amp;pg=PA94 94]: "Those who defy or challenge police authority are punished for failing the 'attitude test' and committing the worst crime of all—'contempt of cop'"; or [[Barbara Seranella]]'s novel ''No Man Standing'' (2003), at 18: "It was more of a power thing, daring you to commit the worst offense: Contempt of Cop."&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''display resolution''' or display modes of a [[digital television]], [[computer monitor]] or [[display device]] is the number of distinct [[pixel]]s in each dimension that can be displayed. It can be an ambiguous term especially as the displayed resolution is controlled by different factors in [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) displays, [[flat-panel display]]s (including [[liquid-crystal display]]s) and projection displays using fixed picture-element (pixel) arrays.

It is usually quoted as '''width × height''', with the units in pixels: for example, "1024 × 768" means the width is 1024 pixels and the height is 768 pixels. This example would normally be spoken as "ten twenty-four by seven sixty-eight" or "ten twenty-four by seven six eight".

One use of the term "display resolution" applies to fixed-pixel-array displays such as [[plasma display panel]]s (PDP), [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCD), [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP) projectors, [[AMOLED|OLED]] displays, and similar technologies, and is simply the physical number of columns and rows of pixels creating the display (e.g. 1920 × 1080). A consequence of having a fixed-grid display is that, for multi-format video inputs, all displays need a "scaling engine" (a digital video processor that includes a memory array) to match the incoming picture format to the display.

For device displays such as phones, tablets, monitors and televisions, the use of the word ''resolution'' as defined above is a misnomer, though common. The term "display resolution" is usually used to mean ''pixel dimensions,'' the number of pixels in each dimension (e.g. 1920 × 1080), which does not tell anything about the pixel density of the display on which the image is actually formed: resolution properly refers to the [[pixel density]], the number of pixels per unit distance or area, not ''total'' number of pixels. In digital measurement, the display resolution would be given in [[pixel density|pixels per inch]] (PPI). In analog measurement, if the screen is 10&amp;nbsp;inches high, then the horizontal resolution is measured across a square 10&amp;nbsp;inches wide. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Screen resolution?

==Considerations==
[[Image:Progressive scan hdtv.svg|thumb|right|1080p progressive scan [[HDTV]], which uses a 16:9 ratio]]
Some commentators also use display resolution to indicate a range of input formats that the display's input electronics will accept and often include formats greater than the screen's native grid size even though they have to be down-scaled to match the screen's parameters (e.g. accepting a [[1080p|1920 × 1080]] input on a display with a native 1366 × 768 pixel array). In the case of television inputs, many manufacturers will take the input and zoom it out to "[[overscan]]" the display by as much as 5% so input resolution is not necessarily display resolution. Graphics wise, the input rate of resolution only changes frame rate by a little bit (e.g. 1080p - 720p = 5f).

The eye's perception of ''display resolution'' can be affected by a number of factors{{snd}} see [[image resolution]] and [[optical resolution]]. One factor is the display screen's rectangular shape, which is expressed as the ratio of the physical picture width to the physical picture height. This is known as the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]. A screen's physical aspect ratio and the individual pixels' aspect ratio may not necessarily be the same. An array of [[Graphics display resolution#WXGA|1280 × 720]] on a [[16:9]] display has square pixels, but an array of [[Graphics display resolution#XGA (1024x768)|1024 × 768]] on a 16:9 display has oblong pixels.

An example of pixel shape affecting "resolution" or perceived sharpness: displaying more information in a smaller area using a higher resolution makes the image much clearer or "sharper". However, most recent screen technologies are fixed at a certain resolution; making the resolution lower on these kinds of screens will greatly decrease sharpness, as an interpolation process is used to "fix" the non-native resolution input into the display's [[native resolution]] output.

While some CRT-based displays may use [[video processing|digital video processing]] that involves [[image scaling]] using memory arrays, ultimately "display resolution" in CRT-type displays is affected by different parameters such as spot size and focus, [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatic effects]] in the display corners, the color phosphor pitch [[shadow mask]] (such as [[Trinitron]]) in color displays, and the video bandwidth.

==Overscan and underscan==
[[File:Fatty watching himself on TV.jpg|thumb|right|A 16:9-ratio television from October 2004]]
[[File:MacBookEeePCNintendoDS.JPG|thumb|right|Difference between screen sizes in some common devices, such as a [[Nintendo DS]] and two laptops shown here.]]
{{Main|Overscan}}

Most television display manufacturers "overscan" the pictures on their displays (CRTs and PDPs, LCDs etc.), so that the effective on-screen picture may be reduced from 720&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;576&amp;nbsp;(480) to 680&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;550&amp;nbsp;(450), for example. The size of the invisible area somewhat depends on the display device. HD televisions do this as well, to a similar extent.

Computer displays including projectors generally do not overscan although many models (particularly CRT displays) allow it. CRT displays tend to be underscanned in stock configurations, to compensate for the increasing distortions at the corners.

===Computer monitors===
{{Further information|Computer display standard}}
Computer monitors have traditionally possessed higher resolutions than most televisions.

====2000s====
{{As of |2002|7}}, 1024 × 768 [[XGA|eXtended Graphics Array]] was the most common display resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Higher screen resolutions more popular for exploring the internet according to OneStat.com |url=http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox8.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716184304/http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox8.html |publisher=OneStat.com |date=2002-07-24 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |accessdate=2012-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Screen resolution 800x600 significantly decreased for exploring the Internet according to OneStat.com |url=http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox51_screen_resolutions_internet.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716184450/http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox51_screen_resolutions_internet.html |publisher=OneStat.com |date=2007-04-18 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |accessdate=2012-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many web sites and multimedia products were re-designed from the previous 800 × 600 format to the layouts optimized for 1024 × 768.

The availability of inexpensive LCD monitors has made the 5:4 aspect ratio resolution of 1280 × 1024 more popular for desktop usage during the first decade of the 21st century. Many computer users including [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] users, graphic artists and video game players ran their computers at 1600 × 1200 resolution ([[UXGA]]) or higher such as 2048 × 1536 [[QXGA]] if they had the necessary equipment. Other available resolutions included oversize aspects like 1400 × 1050 [[SXGA+]] and wide aspects like 1280 × 800 [[Wide XGA|WXGA]], 1440 × 900 [[WXGA+]], 1680 × 1050 [[WSXGA+]], and 1920 × 1200 [[WUXGA]]; monitors built to the 720p and 1080p standard are also not unusual among home media and video game players, due to the perfect screen compatibility with movie and video game releases. A new more-than-HD resolution of 2560 × 1600 [[WQXGA]] was released in 30-inch LCD monitors in 2007.

====2010s====
{{As of|2012|3}}, 1366 × 768 was the most common display resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Higher screen resolutions more popular for exploring the internet according to OneStat.com |url=http://www.techpowerup.com/164027/1366-x-768-most-popular-screen-resolution-overtakes-1024-x-768-statcounter.html |publisher=techpowerup.com |date=2012-04-12 |accessdate=2016-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, 27-inch LCD monitors with the 2560 × 1440-pixel resolution were released by multiple manufacturers including Apple,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=J.R. |title=Apple Releases New Cinema Display: 27 inches, 2560 × 1440 Resolution |publisher=DesktopReview |date=2010-07-27 |url=http://www.desktopreview.com/default.asp?newsID=1158 |accessdate=2012-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012, Apple introduced a 2880 × 1800 display on the [[Retina MacBook Pro|MacBook Pro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple announces iOS 6, MacBook with retina display at WWDC 2012 |publisher=The Times of India |date=2012-06-11 |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-11/gadgets-special/32174166_1_macbook-pro-macbook-air-macbook-air |accessdate=2012-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Panels for professional environments, such as medical use and air traffic control, support resolutions of up to 4096 × 2160 pixels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eizo.com/global/products/duravision/fdh3601 "EIZO DuraVision FDH3601"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyevis.de/index.php?article_id=51&amp;clang=1 "EYE-LCD 6400-4K"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719004546/http://www.eyevis.de/index.php?article_id=51&amp;clang=1 |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optikview.com/?p=228 "Optik View DC801,DC802"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512041707/http://www.optikview.com/?p=228 |date=May 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a computer display resolution is set higher than the physical screen resolution (''native resolution''), some video drivers make the virtual screen scrollable over the physical screen thus realizing a two dimensional [[virtual desktop]] with its viewport. Most LCD manufacturers do make note of the panel's native resolution as working in a non-native resolution on LCDs will result in a poorer image, due to dropping of pixels to make the image fit (when using DVI) or insufficient sampling of the analog signal (when using VGA connector). Few CRT manufacturers will quote the true native resolution, because CRTs are analog in nature and can vary their display from as low as 320 × 200 (emulation of older computers or game consoles) to as high as the internal board will allow, or the image becomes too detailed for the vacuum tube to recreate (''i.e.'', analog blur). Thus, CRTs provide a variability in resolution that fixed resolution LCDs cannot provide.

In recent years the 16:9 aspect ratio has become more common in notebook displays. 1366 × 768 ([[720p|HD]]) has become popular for most notebook sizes, while 1600 × 900 (HD+) and 1920 × 1080 ([[1080p|FHD]]) are available for larger notebooks.

As far as [[Digital cinematography#Acquisition Formats|digital cinematography]] is concerned, video resolution standards depend first on the frames' aspect ratio in the [[film stock]] (which is usually [[motion picture film scanner|scanned]] for [[digital intermediate]] post-production) and then on the actual points' count. Although there is not a unique set of standardized sizes, it is commonplace within the motion picture industry to refer to "''n''K" image "quality", where ''n'' is a (small, usually even) integer number which translates into a set of actual resolutions, depending on the [[film format]]. As a reference consider that, for a 4:3 (around 1.33:1) aspect ratio which a film frame (no matter what is its format) is expected to ''horizontally fit in'', ''n'' is the multiplier of 1024 such that the horizontal resolution is exactly ''1024•n'' points.{{cn |date=May 2018}} For example, 2K reference resolution is 2048 × 1536 pixels, whereas 4K reference resolution is 4096 × 3072 pixels. Nevertheless, 2K may also refer to resolutions like 2048 × 1556 (full-aperture), 2048 × 1152 ([[HDTV]], 16:9 aspect ratio) or 2048 × 872 pixels ([[Cinemascope]], 2.35:1 aspect ratio). It is also worth noting that while a frame resolution may be, for example, 3:2 (720 × 480 NTSC), that is not what you will see on-screen (i.e. 4:3 or 16:9 depending on the orientation of the rectangular pixels).

====Evolution of standards====
&lt;!--Linked from [[Pointer (graphical user interfaces)]]--&gt;
Many personal computers introduced in the late 1970s and the 1980s were designed to use television receivers as their display devices, making the resolutions dependent on the television standards in use, including [[PAL]] and [[NTSC]]. Picture sizes were usually limited to ensure the visibility of all the pixels in the major television standards and the broad range of television sets with varying amounts of over scan. The actual drawable picture area was, therefore, somewhat smaller than the whole screen, and was usually surrounded by a static-colored border (see image to right). Also, the interlace scanning was usually omitted in order to provide more stability to the picture, effectively halving the vertical resolution in progress. 160&amp;nbsp;× 200, 320&amp;nbsp;× 200 and 640&amp;nbsp;× 200 on NTSC were relatively common resolutions in the era (224, 240 or 256 scanlines were also common). In the IBM PC world, these resolutions came to be used by 16-color [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] video cards.

One of the drawbacks of using a classic television is that the computer display resolution is higher than the television could decode. Chroma resolution for NTSC/PAL televisions are bandwidth-limited to a maximum 1.5 megahertz, or approximately 160 pixels wide, which led to blurring of the color for 320- or 640-wide signals, and made text difficult to read (see second image to right). Many users upgraded to higher-quality televisions with [[S-Video]] or [[Color Graphics Adapter|RGBI]] inputs that helped eliminate chroma blur and produce more legible displays. The earliest, lowest cost solution to the chroma problem was offered in the [[Atari 2600]] Video Computer System and the [[Apple II Plus|Apple II+]], both of which offered the option to disable the color and view a legacy black-and-white signal. On the Commodore 64, the [[GEOS (8-bit operating system)|GEOS]] mirrored the Mac OS method of using black-and-white to improve readability.

The 640 × 400i resolution (720 × 480i with borders disabled) was first introduced by home computers such as the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] and, later, Atari Falcon. These computers used interlace to boost the maximum vertical resolution. These modes were only suited to graphics or gaming, as the flickering interlace made reading text in word processor, database, or spreadsheet software difficult. (Modern game consoles solve this problem by pre-filtering the 480i video to a lower resolution. For example, [[Final Fantasy XII]] suffers from flicker when the filter is turned off, but stabilizes once filtering is restored. The computers of the 1980s lacked sufficient power to run similar filtering software.)

The advantage of a 720 × 480i overscanned computer was an easy interface with interlaced TV production, leading to the development of Newtek's [[Video Toaster]]. This device allowed Amigas to be used for CGI creation in various news departments (example: weather overlays), drama programs such as NBC's ''[[seaQuest DSV|seaQuest]]'', The WB's ''[[Babylon 5]]'', and early computer-generated animation by Disney for ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', and ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''.

In the PC world, the [[IBM PS/2]] VGA (multi-color) on-board graphics chips used a non-interlaced (progressive) 640 × 480 × 16 color resolution that was easier to read and thus more useful for office work. It was the standard resolution from 1990 to around 1996.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The standard resolution was 800 × 600 until around 2000. Microsoft [[Windows XP]], released in 2001, was designed to run at 800 × 600 minimum, although it is possible to select the original 640 × 480 in the Advanced Settings window.

Programs designed to mimic older hardware such as Atari, Sega, or Nintendo game consoles (emulators) when attached to multiscan CRTs, routinely use much lower resolutions, such as 160 × 200 or 320 × 400 for greater authenticity, though other emulators have taken advantage of pixelation recognition on circle, square, triangle and other geometric features on a lesser resolution for a more scaled vector rendering.

'''Emil Isac''' ({{IPA-ro|eˈmil iˈsak}}; May 27, 1886 – March 25, 1954) was an [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-born [[Romania]]n poet, dramatist, short story writer and critic. Noted as one of the pioneers of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[modernist literature]] in his native region of [[Transylvania]], he was in tandem one of the leading young voices of the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Symbolist movement]] in the neighboring [[Kingdom of Romania]]. Moving from [[prose poem]]s with [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] traits, fusing [[Neo-romanticism|Neo-romantic]] subjects with modernist [[free verse]], he later created a lyrical discourse in the line of [[Social Realism]]. Isac was likewise known for criticizing traditionalist and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] trends in [[Literature of Romania|local literature]], but, by the end of [[World War I]], opened his own poetry to various traditionalist influences.

Isac was a participant in civic or political causes, defending the rights of [[Romanians|ethnic Romanians]] in Austria–Hungary from a [[Socialism|socialist]] position, and, during the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|1918 union with Romania]], served as a community representative. He was however interested in preserving good relations between his ethnic group and the [[Hungarians]]. An occasional contributor to [[Hungarian language|Hungarian-language]] reviews, he reached out over political divides, maintaining close contacts with Hungarian intellectuals such as [[Endre Ady]], [[Oszkár Jászi]], [[János Thorma]] and [[Aladár Kuncz]].

During the final part of his career, which was spent in [[Communist Romania]], Emil Isac was affiliated with ''Steaua'' magazine and enjoyed political endorsement. In this context, he took the controversial decision of adapting his style to [[Socialist Realism]], producing a number of political poems which doubled as [[agitprop]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
A native of [[Cluj-Napoca]] (''Kolozsvár'') city in Transylvania, the future writer was born to [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] parents: his father, Aurel Isac, was a lawyer, later noted for representing the Romanian civil disobedience ''[[Transylvanian Memorandum|Memorandum]]'' movement, after it was prosecuted by the Hungarian authorities; his mother, Elisabeta-Eliza née Roşescu, was a schoolteacher.&lt;ref name="bjcviata"&gt;''Biobibliografie selectivă. Viaţa'', n. pag.&lt;/ref&gt; As the poet later recalled in a tongue-in-cheek [[memoir]] of his childhood: "I was born in Cluj, when the [[Someş River|Someş]] was boiling with blood and my father reaped the flowers of pain [...]. I came around when called upon by my mother—and the priest baptized me in ''[[Eau de Cologne]]'', or blood, or tears, or [[holy water]]—and my [[Godparent|godfather]] wanted to give me the name Alfred, for he loved [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]], but my father gave me the name [[Emile: or, On Education|Emil]], since he loved [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]."&lt;ref name="gc702"&gt;Călinescu, p.702&lt;/ref&gt;

From a young age, Isac was an avid reader. As he later recalled, he found an optimistic faith in science after being introduced to [[Jules Verne]]'s popular novels.&lt;ref name="caeternul"&gt;{{ro icon}} Corneliu Apetroaiei, [http://old.clujeanul.ro/articol/ziar/cluj/eternul-jules-verne/5403/ "Eternul Jules Verne"], in ''[[Clujeanul]]'', April 12, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He began his education in [[German language|German]], attending a [[Evangelical Church of Augustan Confession in Romania|Transylvanian Evangelical Church]] school in his native city, and later (1895–1901) a [[Hungarian language|Hungarian-language]] [[Catholic school]] run by the [[Piarists]].&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt; Isac was eventually moved to [[Năsăud]] (''Naszód''), at a [[military academy]] for the Romanian [[Grenz infantry|border regiment]] in [[Austro–Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian service]] (1902–1904), but, in 1907, took his ''[[Matura]]'' at the Hungarian Lycée in [[Sibiu]] (''Nagyszeben'').&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt; In the meantime, he made his debut in literature. His first published piece was a 1902 essay on the life and work of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[Vasile Alecsandri]], published in Hungarian by ''Ellenzék'' magazine.&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unifiisac"&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/CMpro-v-p-904.html "Isac Emil"], biographical note in [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/ ''Cronologia della letteratura rumena moderna (1780-1914)'' database], at the [[University of Florence]]'s Department of Neo-Latin Languages and Literatures; retrieved April 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

It was followed a year later by his Hungarian-language translation of two poems, collected from [[Romanian folklore]] and printed by the local periodical ''Koloszvári Friss Ujság'' under the pen name ''Emisac''.&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt; Also in 1903, Isac made his second debut, in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], with ''La umbra plopilor'' ("In the Shadow of Poplar Trees"), a poem published by the Transylvanian literary venue ''[[Familia (literary magazine)|Familia]]''.&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unifiisac"/&gt; He was later a member of ''Familia''{{'}}s editorial staff, where, in March 1905, he wrote Jules Verne's obituary.&lt;ref name="caeternul"/&gt; Over time, his other contributions were featured in such Transylvanian Romanian periodicals as ''[[Cele Trei Crişuri]]'', ''[[Gazeta de Transilvania]]'' and ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]''.&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt;

Emil Isac's editorial debut came in 1908, with the [[lyric poetry]] collection ''Poezii. Impresii şi senzaţii moderne'' ("Poems. Modern Impressions and Sensations").&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unifiisac"/&gt; The work attracted attention from critics, in both the Romanian-speaking areas of the Austro-Hungarian realm and the bordering [[Kingdom of Romania]]: [[Sever Dan]] in Transylvania and [[Mihail Dragomirescu]] in [[Bucharest]] both reviewed it for the cultural press.&lt;ref name="bjcrefer"&gt;''Biobibliografie selectivă. Referinţe critice'', n. pag.&lt;/ref&gt; Its rejection of convention was hotly contested by the tribune of Transylvanian traditionalism, ''[[Ţara Noastră]]'': it called Isac a "bane" for his generation and a "political traitor", referring to his lyrics as "babblings".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/taranoastra/1909/BCUCLUJ_FP_451581_1909_003_006.pdf "Vieaţa literară. Jertfirea lui Isac"], in ''[[Ţara Noastră]]'', Nr. 8/1909, p.41-42 (digitized by the [[Babeş-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, Isac took a degree in law from the [[Franz Joseph University]].&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt; It was during this episode that he met the modern Hungarian writer [[Aladár Kuncz]], who was his lifelong friend.&lt;ref name="jn169"&gt;Neubauer, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; Isac's own affiliation with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] was facilitated by a voyage to [[France]], where he observed first-hand the impact of artistic innovation.&lt;ref name="unifiisac"/&gt; Reportedly, in 1912, Isac also traveled to study in the [[German Empire]], intending to get a [[masters' degree]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="cpluiemil"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cincinat Pavelescu]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Lui_Emil_Isac ''Lui Emil Isac''] (wikisource)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political beginnings and Symbolist militancy===
[[File:Caragiale to Isac.PNG|thumb|400px|Postcard sent to Isac by [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], in which the latter explains the reasons for not wishing to preface Isac's one of Isac's works. Issued from Caragiale's home in [[Berlin]], April 1911]]
Like his father before him, Emil Isac became interested in advancing the cause of Romanians throughout [[Transleithania]] (the regions administered directly from [[Budapest]]). This [[Nationalism|nationalist]] militancy merged with his advocacy of [[left-wing]] causes, leading him to become a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Transylvania and Banat|Transylvanian Social Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unifiisac"/&gt; After 1911, he was in correspondence with the [[Romanian National Party]] activist [[Vasile Goldiş]].&lt;ref name="bjcrefer"/&gt; The young poet was a frequent traveler into the Romanian Kingdom, and he contributed to periodicals of various cultural and political interests which were published there. His work was thus featured in leftist newspapers and reviews, among them ''[[Adevărul Literar şi Artistic]]'', ''[[Dimineaţa]]'', ''[[Facla]]'', ''[[România Muncitoare]]'', but was also hosted by mainstream or even traditionalist media (''[[Sămănătorul]]'', ''[[Universul]]'').&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt; Making his acquaintance with [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romania's Symbolist trend]], Isac also contributed to periodicals which either tolerated or promoted artistic innovation, among them ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'', ''[[Rampa (Romanian magazine)|Rampa]]'', ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'', ''[[Versuri şi Proză]]'' and ''[[Vieaţa Nouă]]''.&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt;

Isac became a personal friend of ''Vieaţa Nouă'' editor, the Symbolist promoter and philologist [[Ovid Densusianu]]. The latter referred to his pupil as "Transylvania's talented poet", which perplexed the anti-Symbolist critic [[Ilarie Chendi]]; Chendi contrarly claimed that Isac was "made famous by frivolous people".&lt;ref name="icvieata"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ilarie Chendi]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/luceafarul/1912/BCUCLUJ_FP_280091_1912_011_003.pdf "Vieaţa literară în 1911 (o privire generală)"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 3/1912, p.63 (digitized by the [[Babeş-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; Emil Isac's later memoirs describe in some detail Densusianu's [[dandy]] habits and generosity, which the academic kept as a standard even as he was facing material ruin, and note that such efforts accounted for Denusianu being ostensibly "weighed down", "impoverished", "submerged in thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Iordan Datcu, [http://www.romlit.ro/omagiu_lui_ovid_densusianu "Omagiu lui Ovid Densusianu"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 19/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Although involved in such projects, Emil Isac spend the pre-[[World War I]] years building bridges with members of the [[Hungarians|ethnic Hungarian]] elite in Transylvania and beyond. He maintained personal contacts with opinion leaders, among them poets [[Endre Ady]], [[Mihály Babits]], [[Dezső Kosztolányi]], and painter [[János Thorma]].&lt;ref name="bjcrefer"/&gt; Following his interest in [[Culture of Hungary|Hungarian culture]], Isac was one of the Romanians who maintained connections with the influential Hungarian-language review ''[[Nyugat]]'', which was at the time equally interested in chronicling [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]]. Writing in 1913, [[Ignotus]], ''Nyugat'' editor and leading cultural critic, defended the political participation of non-Hungarian communities, commending both Isac and the traditionalist Romanian poet [[Octavian Goga]] for their resistance to [[Magyarization]].&lt;ref name="mdf62"&gt;Fenyo, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

While Goga, defended by Endre Ady during his [[Political prisoner|political imprisonment]] of 1912, soon disappointed the group with his [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] rhetoric and his uncompromising stance,&lt;ref&gt;Fenyo, p.61-62; Neubauer, p.168-169&lt;/ref&gt; Isac remained close to the [[Liberalism|liberal]] or left-wing Hungarian circles. After witnessing the end of Goga's friendship with Ady, he was himself involved in a conflict with the former's radical approach, arguing that people "on both sides" needed "to evaluate, without prejudice, their own blemishes and virtues".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gabriela Adameşteanu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/supliment-bucurestiul-cultural-nr-24-3384.html "Promovarea culturii costă bani, bani şi iarăşi bani!" (interview with Jenö Farkas)], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 880, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1912, Isac was working with Kuncz on a trans-communal theatrical project: the staging of Ady's ''A műhelyben'' ("In the Workshop") by a theater in Bucharest, to coincide with the Budapest performance of plays by Isac and the prestigious comedy author [[Ion Luca Caragiale]].&lt;ref name="mdf63"&gt;Fenyo, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; The project was abandoned, probably because of Caragiale's sudden death in Berlin.&lt;ref name="mdf63"/&gt;

In April of that year, Emil Isac also joined the circle formed around [[Ion Minulescu]] and his rebelliously Symbolist magazine, the Bucharest-based ''Insula''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.26-27&lt;/ref&gt; By the same time, the young poet was entering another polemic with the more traditionalist wing of Romania's intellectual movement, represented at the time by historian and literary theorist [[Nicolae Iorga]], former editor of the nationalist tribune ''[[Sămănătorul]]''. In 1912, he became a contributor to the short-lived Symbolist review ''[[Simbolul]]'', issued in Bucharest by the high school students [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Marcel Janco]] and [[Ion Vinea]] (all of whom were later [[avant-garde]] figures). It was there that Isac published [[satire]] specifically aimed at Iorga's group.&lt;ref name="pc50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ts76"&gt;[[Tom Sandqvist]], ''Dada East. The Romanians of Cabaret Voltaire'', MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts &amp; London, 2006, p.76. {{ISBN|0-262-19507-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those articles where he specifically targeted Iorga's principles enlisted a negative response from ''Consânzeana'', the [[Orăştie]]-based review of [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] priest [[Ioan Moţa]] (it called Isac ''Don Quijote de la Cluj'', "the [[Don Quixote]] of Cluj").&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Iancu, [http://istorie.uab.ro/publicatii/colectia_bcss/bcss_2/30_iancu.pdf "Istorie şi istorici în revista ''Cosânzeana'' (1911-1915)"], in the [[1 Decembrie 1918 University, Alba Iulia|December 1 University of Alba Iulia]]'s [http://istorie.uab.ro/publicatii/colectia_bcss/bcss_2/bcss2.html ''Buletinul Cercurilor Ştiinţifice Studenţeşti, 2, 1996''], p.235&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Isac's articles continued to champion mutual respect between Hungarian and Romanian intellectuals: a letter defending Ady in his dispute with Goga saw print in Ady's ''[[Világ]]'' review (February 1913), and another one, to Ignotus, was published in ''Nyugat'' as ''Az új magyar irodalom'' ("The New [[Hungarian literature|Hungarian Literature]]"); the same year, ''Nyugat'' also received his ''Új románság'' ("New Romanians") essay, in which Isac claimed that the two communities had a common interest in resisting the threat of [[Pan-Slavism]].&lt;ref name="jn168"&gt;Neubauer, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, at the [[Causes of World War I|buildup to World War I]], ''Nyugat'' published Isac's review of Goga's [[Political theatre|political play]] ''[[Mr. the Notary]]'', his sympathetic obituary to the neutralist [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol I of Romania]], and his ''A román-magyar béke'' ("The Romanian-Hungarian Peace"), which optimistically argued that the policies of [[István Tisza]] could limit dangerous distrust between the two sides in question.&lt;ref name="jn168"/&gt; The same journal published Isac's one-page-long [[sketch story]], ''A szerecsen'' ("The [[Moors|Moor]]").&lt;ref&gt;Fenyo, p.62; Neubauer, p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I and unionist activity===
Early during the war, Isac was carrying on with his literary work in the Romanian Kingdom, which still pursued a neutrality policy before joining the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] in summer 1916 (''see [[Romania during World War I]]''). During that interval, he again outraged the traditionalist public, when his dramolet ''Maica cea tânără'' ("The Young Nun"), questioning the Romanian Orthodox view of monastery life, was staged by the [[National Theater Bucharest]] (1914).&lt;ref name="pc50"&gt;Cernat, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; His second volume, comprising prose poems, was issued in and dedicated to his native region: ''Ardealule, Ardealule bătrân'' ("Transylvania, Old Transylvania"), published in 1916 by the Orthodox [[Diocese of Arad, Ienopole and Hălmagiu|Diocese of Arad]].&lt;ref name="bjcopera"&gt;''Biobibliografie selectivă. Opera'', n. pag.&lt;/ref&gt; Isac also contributed his texts to ''Cronica'', a literary and political magazine published in Bucharest by Symbolist poet [[Tudor Arghezi]]; this review was later criticized by the mainstream politicians as a venue for [[Collaborationism|collaborationists]] and [[Germanophile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian Boia]], ''"Germanofilii". Elita intelectuală românească în anii Primului Război Mondial'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 2010, p.103.  {{ISBN|978-973-50-2635-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the other magazines who received his contributions was the Symbolist tribune ''Absolutio'', published in [[Iaşi]] by the Arghezian disciple [[Isac Ludo]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1918, Isac was seeking to obtain an amicable solution to the ethnic conflicts rekindled by the war, in the context of Austria–Hungary's dissolution, the [[Aster Revolution]], and the advent of a [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]]. As early as 1917, Isac signed an [[open letter]], published by ''Világ'', in which he rallied with [[Pacifism|pacifist]] thinker [[Oszkár Jászi]] (who became Minister of Nationalities in the Aster Revolution), arguing: "For us of the [other] nationalities your name in recent months has sounded like a reassuring chime of bells, your name has signified to us vigorous defense, and through your writings democratic Hungary has made its voice heard."&lt;ref name="gl132"&gt;Litván, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[György Litván]] notes that this was the type of messages motivating Jászi to "stubbornly" believe that his [[Danubian Confederation]] projects could win support from all sides, even though other reactions were already showing their practical limitations and their unpopularity.&lt;ref name="gl132"/&gt;

In the end, Isac opted to throw his support behind the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|unionist movement]]. He attended the 9th Social Democratic Congress, and was elected a representative to the [[Alba Iulia]] assembly.&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="albani16-17"&gt;"Am trăit...", p.16-17&lt;/ref&gt; There, on December 1, the Romanian socialist clubs, together with the Romanian National Party and the various other civic forces, demanded the union with Romania  (''see [[Great Union Day]]''). According to fellow socialist [[Tiron Albani]], Isac first sparked disagreements within the unionist gathering, after endorsing proposals that the Romanian Kingdom become a republic in exchange for union. Isac's controversial address to his peers, as cited by Grapini, stresses: "a quarter of an hour ago you have approved of the resolution [to uphold civil liberties]. Now you are revolted that a human idea is being expressed. Today, when three emperors have been ejected and their crowns hurled back at them! Would you be more consistent! [...] a king may well be good and wise, but he may also be a tyrant, and he'll still be king".&lt;ref&gt;"Am trăit...", p.16&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the socialist delegation renounced its republican aims, placated by a resolution to ensure [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]] and workers' rights throughout the resulting nation.&lt;ref name="albani16-17"/&gt;

In 1919, as the act of union was being assessed by foreign powers, Isac represented the Romanian lobby as a [[press attaché]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt; Back in Cluj, Isac entered Romanian government service as superintendent of Transylvanian and [[Banat]] theaters (an office he kept from 1920 to 1940).&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt; He helped set up the Cluj branch of the [[Romanian Writers' Society]] (of which he was already a member by that time).&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt; His cultural activity in [[Greater Romania]] was rewarded with two civil decorations: he was made a Knight of the Romanian [[Order of the Crown (Romania)|Order of the Crown]] and received the ''[[Ordinul Cultural]]'' medal, First Class.&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt;

Another focus of Isac's political activity was mediating a [[Hungary–Romania relations|Hungarian–Romanian reconciliation]], both before and after the [[Hungarian–Romanian War of 1919|1919 military conflict]], while reaching out to both Hungarians in Hungary and the [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarian community in Romania]]. As noted by literary historians John Neubauer and [[Marcel Cornis-Pope]], Isac was one of the Romanian authors who could combine a nationalist outlook with respect for [[Minorities of Romania|minority cultures]]: in his articles for the Bucharest-based ''[[Ideea Europeană]]'' magazine and the Hungarian ''[[Napkelet]]'' of Cluj, he demanded equal [[cultural rights]] for all of Greater Romania's communities.&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer ''et al.'', p.272-273. See also Neubauer, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; His call to the "great masses" of Romanians and Hungarians, read: "There is only one possible politics in Romania: the politics of true democracy. By its very nature such politics safeguards the rights of everybody, [including] Hungarians, who lead today an isolated life in Transylvania. [...] it is the duty of Romanian writers to initiate divorce proceedings from the negative traditions".&lt;ref name="jn169"/&gt;

In his other political articles, Isac notably expressed his alarm at seeing the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Regency regime]] take shape in post-[[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]] Hungary, writing that the exiled Oszkár Jászi was preferable as national leader to the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[Miklós Horthy]].&lt;ref name="gl234"&gt;Litván, p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He gave a positive review to Jászi's renewed campaigning in favor of a Danubian Confederation to replace competing [[nation state]]s, but argued that there was little prospect of "today's generation", in both Romania and Hungary, to endorse the project.&lt;ref name="gl234"/&gt; Answering to this objection, Jászi himself suggested that Isac take into consideration the creation of a Danubian cultural Alliance, with "civilized" representatives from Hungary, Romania, the [[Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938)|Czechoslovak Republic]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="gl234"/&gt; Isac, György Litván notes, remained evasive, and, even as Jászi was facing much criticism from partisans of Hungarian [[ethnic nationalism]], as well as from Romanian advocates of [[Centralized government|centralism]], refused to help Jászi and his associate [[Pál Szende]] tour the Transylvanian conference circuit.&lt;ref name="gl234"/&gt;

===Interwar cultural contributions===
Isac's return to the forefront of literary debates was consecrated in 1919, when, in an interview for ''[[Rampa (Romanian magazine)|Rampa]]'', he discussed "Transylvania's role" in [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]].&lt;ref name="bjcrefer"/&gt; In August of that year, modernist literary theorist and reviewer [[Eugen Lovinescu]] wrote the article ''Emil Isac redivivus!'' ("Emil Isac Brought Back to Life!"), published by his ''[[Sburătorul]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="bjcrefer"/&gt; In the same context, Isac sparked debates by commenting negatively on ''[[Poemele luminii]]'', the debut volume of fellow Transylvanian poet [[Lucian Blaga]] (his reaction was notably received with irony by poet-critic [[Artur Enăşescu]] and his colleagues at ''Junimea de Nord'' magazine in [[Botoşani]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dan Mănucă]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MANUCAaug8.html "Arcade septentrionale"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Isac's Symbolist colleague Davidescu reviewed his entire work in the critical essay ''Poezia d-lui Emil Isac'' ("Mr. Emil Isac's Poetry"), contributed for a November 1922 issue of ''[[Flacăra]]'' journal.&lt;ref name="bjcrefer"/&gt; For part of that decade, Isac was close to [[Cezar Petrescu]]'s Cluj-based literary review ''[[Gândirea]]'', whose agenda was a distinct mix of traditionalism and modernism, and who later alienated its modernist contributors by switching to [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Geo Vasile, [http://www.romlit.ro/gndirea_fr_prejudeci "''Gândirea'', fără prejudecăţi"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 5/2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an occasional contributor to [[Ion Vinea]]'s avant-garde venue, ''[[Contimporanul]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.50; Crohmălniceanu, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, the poet was pursuing his interest in visual arts, and especially involved in the [[professionalization]] of Transylvania's art scene. To this goal, he joined [[Aurel Popp]], [[George Bacaloglu]] and [[János Thorma]] in setting up the ''Collegium Artificum Transilvanicorum'', an art salon where artists of all trades and ethnicities could exhibit their work (February 1921).&lt;ref name="vrscolile"&gt;{{ro icon}} Vasile Radu, [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/doc_db_site/tribuna/4afc38ea83992172E.pdf "Şcolile artistice din Cluj şi Timişoara între iniţiativă privată şi învăţământ public"], in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 172, November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; From 1925 to 1931,&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt; he was also a Professor of Aesthetics at the newly founded [[Art and Design University of Cluj-Napoca|Fine Arts School of Cluj]], and as such a faculty colleague of several influential figures in 20th century [[Art of Romania|Romanian art theory]], painters ([[Catul Bogdan]], [[Aurel Ciupe]], [[Anastase Demian]], [[Romulus Ladea]], [[Eugen Pascu]], [[Alexandru Popp]]) as well as intellectuals (historian [[Coriolan Petreanu]], critics [[Liviu Rusu]] and [[Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică]]).&lt;ref name="vrscolile"/&gt;

Around 1926, he was co-opted as a contributor by the venue of [[Asociaţia Transilvană pentru Literatura Română şi Cultura Poporului Român|ASTRA Society]], ''Transilvania'': it published one of Isac's poems and the text of his public lecture ''Propaganda artistică'' ("Art Propaganda").&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/transilvania/1926/BCUCLUJ_FP_279996_1926_057_001.pdf "Cuprinsul anului 1926"], in ''Transilvania'' special issue, 1926, p.II, III (digitized by the [[Babeş-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; As superintendent of the theaters and cultural activist, Isac also participated, with journalist [[Ion Clopoţel]], on a major cultural reunion of Hungarian, [[Transylvanian Saxons|Transylvanian Saxon]] and Romanian authors (November 1928); other noted participants were [[Miklós Bánffy]], [[Mária Berde]], [[Egon Hajek]], [[Sándor Makkai]], [[Adolf Meschendörfer]], [[Károly Molter]] and [[Heinrich Zillich]].&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[interwar period]], Emil Isac published several new volumes of poetry and prose, beginning with ''Poeme în proză'' ("Prose Poems", [[Oradea]], 1923), and followed by two books of articles and essays, both printed in 1925 under the auspices of the Arad Diocese: ''Cartea unui om'' ("A Man's Book") and ''Notiţele mele'' ("My Little Notes").&lt;ref name="bjcoperarefer"&gt;''Biobibliografie selectivă'': ''Opera'', ''Referinţe critice'', n. pag.&lt;/ref&gt; The writer also issued a print version of ''Maica cea tânără'' (Cluj, 1931), and two volumes of collected poems, published in 1936 by, respectively, [[Cartea Românească]] publishing house and the eponymous publishing company of ''[[Adevărul]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref name="bjcopera"/&gt; These various works kept Isac in the focus of critical attention. Reviews were notably written by: [[Ovid Densusianu]], [[Claudia Millian]] and [[Camil Petrescu]] (''Poeme în proză''); [[Romulus Dianu]] and [[Perpessicius]] (''Cartea unui om'', ''Notiţele mele''); [[Tudor Bugnariu]], [[Alexandru Al. Philippide]] and [[Eugeniu Sperantia]] (the other poetry volumes).&lt;ref name="bjcrefer"/&gt; In 1928, Isac was also interviewed by short story author [[I. Valerian]], their dialogues seeing print in ''Viaţa Literară'' magazine, with the general title ''Un precursor al poeziei moderniste. De vorbă cu d. Emil Isac'' ("A Precursor of Modernist Poetry. In Conversation with Mr. Emil Isac").&lt;ref name="bjcrefer"/&gt; Five years later, the same venue hosted Isac's conversation with cultural journalist Octavian Şireagu: ''Cu d. Emil Isac despre critici şi modernişti'' ("With Mr. Emil Isac on Critics and Modernists").&lt;ref name="bjcrefer"/&gt; Several other such interviews followed, including a 1936 ''Adevărul'' piece where he was engaged by [[George Macovescu]], the leftist activist, in a conversation about "poetry, theater [and] peace".&lt;ref name="bjcrefer"/&gt; Isac's own leftist views led him to contribute articles for the pro-socialist newspaper ''[[Cuvântul Liber (1933)|Cuvântul Liber]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II and late 1940s===
During [[World War II]] and after the cession of [[Northern Transylvania]] to Hungary, Isac left Cluj for the part of the country still controlled by Bucharest.&lt;ref name="dc14"&gt;Câmpean, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; He made his return to Cluj some time after the [[King Michael's Coup|August 23, 1944 Coup]] which toppled the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[Ion Antonescu]] regime, aligned Romania with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], and initiated the recovery of Northern Transylvania (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''). Literary historians note that he subsequently became, with [[Lucian Blaga]] and [[Ion Agârbiceanu]], one of the most important Romanian writers to continue residing in that city after 1945.&lt;ref name="dc14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pplocuri2"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Petru Poantă]], [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/doc_db_site/tribuna/tribuna75.pdf "Locuri şi personaje" (II)], in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 75, October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, poet [[Miron Radu Paraschivescu]], who had already published a review of Isac's lifelong contributions in ''[[Timpul]]'' newspaper (1942), supervised the publication of his integral edition, ''Opere'' ("Works").&lt;ref name="bjcoperarefer"/&gt; The following year, Hungarian versions of some of his poems were included in the [[anthology]] ''Mai román lira'' ("Modern Romanian Verse"), published in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name="bjcopera"/&gt;

During the political transition ending with the establishment of a [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]], Emil Isac adapted his literary and political stances to the new ideological requirements, sparking negative comments in later exegesis with his effective endorsement of a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state. His cooperation with the [[Romanian Communist Party]] and his endorsement of Romania's [[Soviet occupation of Romania|political alignment]] with the [[Soviet Union]] resulted in his collaboration on ''Veac Nou'', official newspaper of the [[Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="lcinstrumente"&gt;{{ro icon}} Letiţia Constantin, [http://www.romlit.ro/instrumente_ale_agitaiei_culturale_n_perioada_1944-1954 "Instrumente ale 'agitaţiei culturale' în perioada 1944-1954"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 19/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Cluj writers, he and Agârbiceanu became associates of the communists, while Blaga resisted such advances and was [[Censorship in Communist Romania|censored]].&lt;ref name="pplocuri2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Câmpean, p.13-15, 16, 18-21&lt;/ref&gt; Both of them, however, were for a while equally unsuccessful in setting up new Romanian-language cultural reviews: their projects were rejected by the communist authorities, who would only allow the existence of a Hungarian venue (''[[Utunk]]'') and literary supplements in local newspapers (such as ''Almanahul Literar'', which was published together with ''[[Lupta Ardealului]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Câmpean, p.14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not enlisted in the ruling Communist Party—or, as it styled itself at the time, the Workers' Party, PMR—Isac also received ''[[Ordinul Muncii]]'' medal, the regime's recognition of social or cultural importance.&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt; In 1948, he became a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy]].&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt; Nevertheless, Neubauer suggests, Isac and the entire Transylvanian generation had by then lost their cultural importance: "Some of the survivors still had a minor career after the war, in Transylvania or beyond it, but the most creative and hopeful years of the generation died with the [world] war."&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer, p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Steaua'' affiliation and final years===
Isac was affiliated with ''Almanahul Literar'' before 1949, when it was redesigned as ''Steaua'' monthly (for long still the only Romanian-language literary periodical published in Cluj).&lt;ref&gt;Câmpean, p.14-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mg(des)facem"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mariana Gorczyca, [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=8504 "Să (des)facem totul..."], in ''[[Contemporanul]]'', Nr. 12/2006 (republished by the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ ''România Culturală''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=September 2, 2011 }}); retrieved April 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His contributions reflected the politicized editorial line, especially by endorsing the [[personality cult]] of Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]]: his poem ''Scrisoare către Stalin'' ("A Letter to Stalin") opened the very first issue of ''Steaua'',&lt;ref name="mg(des)facem"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Câmpean, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; and another such piece, ''Slavă nemuritorului Stalin'' ("Glory to the Immortal Stalin"), was hosted by the review upon Stalin's 1953 death.&lt;ref&gt;Selejan, p.352&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Isac was part of ''Steaua'' jury presided upon by poet [[Anatol E. Baconsky]], awarding the magazine's annual prize to a high school student by the name of Ion Motoarcă. They were thus the unwitting subjects of a prank, played on them by the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] poet and [[Sibiu Literary Circle]] member [[Ştefan Augustin Doinaş]]: waging that he could write poetry better poetry than those authors promoted by the regime, and probably enticed by the prospect of financial gain, Doinaş had agreed to hide his [[Parody|parodic]] contributions under Motoarcă's signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} George Neagoe, [http://revistacultura.ro/nou/2010/04/pcatele-tineretii-stefan-aug-doinas-a-k-a-ion-motoarca/ "Păcatele tinereţii. Ştefan Aug. Doinaş a.k.a. Ion Motoarcă"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 66/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Emil Isac died in March 1954, in Cluj.&lt;ref name="bjcviata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unifiisac"/&gt; Some of his final works were published later that year: the [[Union of Communist Youth|Workers' Youth]] organ ''[[Scînteia Tineretului]]'' featured three pages of his posthumous poetry.&lt;ref name="bjcopera"/&gt; The PMR voice, ''[[Scînteia]]'', hosted an article signed by communist poet laureate [[Mihai Beniuc]], and similar posthumous homage pieces were published by [[Ion Brad]], [[Cezar Petrescu]], [[Veronica Porumbacu]] and, at an [[Eastern Bloc]] level, Hungarian author [[Károly Molter]] (in both ''[[Igaz Szó]]'' and ''[[Literárni Noviny]]'').&lt;ref name="bjcrefer"/&gt; In 1957, the same venue published his final text for the stage, ''Domnul Million'' ("Mr. Million").&lt;ref name="bjcopera"/&gt;

===Early positioning and Symbolist prose===
[[File:Em. Isac - Cântec.PNG|thumb|270px|Fragment from Isac's poem ''Cântec'' ("Song")]]
Emil Isac's contribution to the development of [[modernist literature]] in Romanian-speaking areas was pioneering: deemed "the first 'modernist' Transylvanian poet" by critic [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]],&lt;ref name="ggpoeti"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/poei_din_nord_ii "Poeţi din Nord" (II)], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 5/2007&lt;/ref&gt; he was also called "a [Symbolist] exception on the other side of the [[Carpathians]]" by literary historian [[Paul Cernat]].&lt;ref name="pc50"/&gt; Reviewing his own political battles, the poet identified such support for innovation with the rejection of [[isolationism]]: "I write these words, these consoled, gentle, tired words, after a violent campaign. And I am tranquil when noting that I was right after all, in maintaining that, to us Romanians, modernism is the only force that may lead to a victory. [...] The world is not aware of us, because our nationalism has sealed us hermetically in front of all propitious influences."&lt;ref&gt;Alexandru Ruja, [http://www.revistaorizont.ro/arhiva/mai2009.pdf "Modernismul literar"], in ''[[Orizont]]'', Nr. 5/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Isac's trademark contribution to the development of [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romania's Symbolist movement]] was his work in the [[prose poem]] genre, with [[Exoticism|exotic]] reveries borrowing from a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] model set in [[English literature]] by [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref name="gc702"/&gt; In general, literary historian [[George Călinescu]] notes, these pieces are "willingly grandiloquent and [[Egotism|egolatrous]], often ending with a pun".&lt;ref name="gc702"/&gt; According to Călinescu, they merged in style with Isac's various [[Satire|satirical]] articles, the latter of which make use of techniques similar to those employed by writer and humorist [[Tudor Arghezi]], but display original "[[Rococo]]" touches.&lt;ref name="gc702"/&gt; Isac's basic humorous technique, the critic notes, was one where "the most humble occurencies are eerily detached", such as in depicting a [[Japan]]ese man's visit to Cluj: "But what is it you're looking for, child of [[Empire of Japan|Dai-Nipon]], with your [[typhoon]]-like soul, here in our home?"&lt;ref name="gc702"/&gt; Similarly, the ''[[Nyugat]]'' piece ''A szerecsen'' delves into [[racial stereotype]]s, discussing the perception of [[Black people|Black men]] as [[sex symbol]]s.&lt;ref name="mdf62"/&gt; In one of his ''[[Vieaţa Nouă]]'' essays, published in 1911 to the irritation of [[Ilarie Chendi]], Isac aimed to prove that Transylvanians were "[[Demagogy|demagogues]]"—this thesis quoted liberally from philosophers such as [[Desiderius Erasmus]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref name="icvieata"/&gt;

Another product of this creative period was his main contribution to ''[[Simbolul]]'', the faux memoir piece ''Protopopii familiei mele'' ("My Family's [[Protopope]]s"). The piece was reviewed by literary historians as a relevant step in Symbolism's mutation into the [[avant-garde]]. Paul Cernat, who notes its similarity to the prose poetry of [[Absurdism|absurdist]] cult hero [[Urmuz]], defines it as "a very modern playful-ironic and imaginative-parodic piece".&lt;ref name="pc50"/&gt; The text is Isac's answer to political attacks, and indirectly evidences his solidarity with the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish-Romanian community]]. Cernat sees in it: "[Isac's] answers to [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] insinuations made by the nationalist publications, intrigued by the [Jewish] resonance of his name."&lt;ref name="pc50"/&gt; [[Sweden|Swedish]] researcher [[Tom Sandqvist]], who finds the implication of solidarity with the Romanian Jews "quite remarkable", also argues: "The story is also explicitly aimed against [[Nicolae Iorga]] and his anti-Semitism, telling how Iorga—obviously—has written that the narrator Emil Isac's omitting to properly pay homage to the great historian and philosopher Nicolae Iorga is due to the simple fact that Isac is a Jew."&lt;ref name="ts76"/&gt; Written as the short biography of a "[[Decadent movement|decadent]] joker" in relation to his extended family, ''Protopopii familiei mele'' shows its protagonist being visited at his deathbed by some unusually long-living Orthodox clergymen, who present him with absurd gifts.&lt;ref name="ts76"/&gt;

===Isac and Symbolist poetry===
Like many other Romanian Symbolists, from [[Eugeniu Ştefănescu-Est]] and [[Ion Minulescu]] to [[N. Davidescu]], [[George Bacovia]] and [[D. Iacobescu]], Isac made a point of using [[free verse]] to as a way of airing ideological differences, and, according to critic [[Vladimir Streinu]], "cultivated literary scandal either in [[macabre]] or immoral motifs, or in a [[Meter (poetry)|meter]] that defied all norms".&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, p.125&lt;/ref&gt; Alternating free verse with more conventional forms (he was among the few affiliates of the movement to still appreciate the traditional [[Foot (prosody)|metrical foot]]),&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; his Symbolist poetry is defined by Călinescu as a compilation of elements borrowed from poets based in the [[Kingdom of Romania]]: Minulescu (in his descriptions of furnished interiors) and Bacovia (the "heart rending" ambiance and the references to musical instruments).&lt;ref name="gc702"/&gt; According to the same author, Isac viewed his sources in the manner of a [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] and "[[Vlachs|Vlach]]" author in his relation to [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref name="gc702"/&gt; Together with the Minulescian or Bacovian elements, the Transylvanian author's poetry followed the other conventions of the Symbolist epoch, from depictions of the autumnal landscapes or everyday tragedies (the burial of an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest's daughter) to elements which, Călinescu notes, suggest a "tendency of transfiguring the real" (for instance, the ocean life trapped inside a jar, or a waiter's flight to [[Mars]]).&lt;ref name="gc702"/&gt;

One particular trait of Isac's poetic universe is his preference for strong chromatic contrasts. Călinescu, who notes this "pictorial aspect" (and likens it to [[poster art]]), supports his interpretation with the fragment from one of Isac's poems:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Contesa şedea pe un scaun de argint. Ochii ei erau albaştri. Am băut şampanie multă.
Contesa a vrut să plângă.
A poruncit lăutarilor să cânte vesel, căci veselia lăutarilor stoarce lacrimi.
Şi la masa de aur au cântat ţiganii negri, din lăute roşii.}}&lt;ref name="gc702"/&gt;

The countess was sitting on a silver chair. Her eyes were blue. We drank lots of champagne.
The countess wanted to sob.
She ordered the ''[[lăutari]]'' to sing merrily, for the joy of ''lăutari'' wrings tears.
And, at the golden table, the black [[Romani people|Gypsies]] sang, playing red [[lute]]s.}}

Discussing the Symbolists' overall appreciation of "[[Synesthesia|synesthesic]]" [[epithet]]s, scholar Carmen Nicolescu writes about Isac's particular reference to the color white when suggesting suffocation:
{{Verse translation|lang=ro|
Nu mai cred în tine, 
Sunt robit de ceaţă.
Moare-n mine, moare-n mine
Dragostea de viaţă.

Vine alba ceaţă,
Viaţă, neagră viaţă&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Carmen Nicolescu, [http://www.uab.ro/reviste_recunoscute/index.php?cale=2007_tom1 "Ocurenţe ale epitetului sinestezic în lirica simbolistă românească"], in the [[1 Decembrie 1918 University, Alba Iulia|December 1 University of Alba Iulia]]'s [http://www.uab.ro/reviste_recunoscute/index.php?cale=philologica ''Philologica Yearbook''], 2007 (Vol. I), p.135-136&lt;/ref&gt;

I no longer trust in you,
I'm trapped by the fog.

The love for life.

Here comes the white fog,

''Maica cea tânără'', a [[One-act play|one-act]] [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse drama]] called "[[Neo-romanticism|neo-romantic]] dramolet" by Călinescu, shows an Orthodox nun committing murder against the bride of her former lover.&lt;ref name="gc702"/&gt; Călinescu primarily notes the play for illustrating in dramatic form Isac's generic poetic principles, in particular his use of visual elements such as color clashes.&lt;ref name="gc702"/&gt;

===From protest poems to Socialist Realism===
A second stage in Isac's career came with the reorienting toward certain traditionalist subjects, in particular by taking inspiration from his rival [[Octavian Goga]], the leading voice of Transylvanian traditionalism. Like Goga and other voices in Transylvania, he wrote verse shaped by the influence of [[Mihai Eminescu]], the [[national poet]] and mentor of all traditionalist sub-currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Buzaşi, [http://www.romlit.ro/eminescu_n_transilvania "Eminescu în Transilvania"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 23/2000&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Neubauer and [[Marcel Cornis-Pope]], Isac's interwar career exemplified one of the two schools in Transylvania's Romanian-language poetry: to the current of [[Emil Giugiuca]] and other poets inspired by [[George Coşbuc]]'s [[elegiac]] tone, Isac and [[Aron Cotruş]] opposed a neo-romantic and "prophetic" attitude borrowed from Goga.&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer ''et al.'', p.264&lt;/ref&gt; While, in Cotruş's case, this came as an [[Ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalist]] discourse about "the ethnic and social battles of the Romanians", Isac "combined [[social realism]] with Symbolism, offering dramatic-grotesque descriptions of Transylvanian rural and city culture, and depictions of the poet's existential isolation."&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer ''et al.'', p.264-265&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditionalist elements in Isac's writings were inventoried by George Călinescu. He suggested that the poet merged Goga's "grief" with elements of social protest ("pale workers gathering at the sound of a [[Siren (noisemaker)|siren]], orphaned children of the ''[[Ţara Moţilor|moţi]]''") and even imagery related to that of devotional Romanian Orthodox ("Orthodoxist") poets.&lt;ref name="gc702"/&gt; Another significant trait of his modernist synthesis is, according to Grigurcu, the "air of confrontation between peasant 'health' and the 'decadent' temptation".&lt;ref name="ggpoeti"/&gt;

This aspect of Isac's career notably produced lyrics expressing his intense love for the place of his birth:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Ardealul este fântâna de aur
Ardealul este mătase,
Ardealul este lacrimi de pâne;
Ardealul este dulce ca mierea
Ardealul este ciobanul cu câne
El este visul fără deşteptare}}&lt;ref name="mgpeisaj"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihaela Grancea, [http://www.cultura-fcr.ro/IMAGINI/PDF/Numarul%204%20pagina.pdf "Peisaj cu case memoriale"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 4/2006, p.29-30&lt;/ref&gt;
|
Transylvania is the golden fountain
Transylvania is silk,
Transylvania is tears of bread;
Transylvania is as sweet as honey
Transylvania is the shepherd and his dog
It is the dream with no reveille}}

The final part of Isac's career was marked by the politicization of his writing, in line with [[Socialist Realism]] and its [[Socialist realism in Romania|Romanian literary avatar]]. His poetry pieces for ''Veac Nou'' are seen by academic Letiţia Constantin as evidence that Isac had a satisfactory political background from the communist point of view. Constantin describes them as [[agitprop]] pieces, stylistically "[[pastiche]]s" of Soviet poetry.&lt;ref name="lcinstrumente"/&gt; The importance Isac had for the new literary mainstream, shaped in the 1950s by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|censorship]] and waves of political repression, was underlined by communist poet [[Dan Deşliu]] in a 1956 report for the [[Writers' Union of Romania]]: "after [[World War I]] and especially in the period of our country's [[Fascism|fascization]], [...] the flame of poetry continued to burn, lighting the way of tomorrow. With different intensities, its rays are the creation of poets who have long since entered Romanian literary history, such as: [[George Topîrceanu|G. Topîrceanu]], [[Alexandru Toma|A. Toma]], Emil Isac, G. Bacovia or maestro Tudor Arghezi, whom we presently take joy in counting among the active members in our ranks".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cassian Maria Spiridon]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/TATAnov3.html "Un congres al scriitorilor" (II)], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The contextual relevancy of Isac's lyrical tributes to [[Joseph Stalin]] was assessed by literary historians such as Diana Câmpean and Mariana Gorczyca, who researched the impact of [[communization]] on the various literary magazines of the 1950s and '60s. In Câmpean's view, ''Scrisoare către Stalin'' as one of the signs that ''Steaua'' was "tributary to [[proletkult]] demands", as a package for the other content, which was more focused on the "actual" and "valuable" elements in Romanian literature (from the celebration of its dead classics to the recovery of non-political voices such as Blaga).&lt;ref&gt;Câmpean, p.15-16&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gorczyca, Isac's 1949 poem, together with similar ones by [[Ion Brad]], [[Victor Felea]] and [[Miron Radu Paraschivescu]], illustrates the "embarrassing obedience" to a political line imposed on writers by the country's officials.&lt;ref name="mg(des)facem"/&gt; To underline its circumstantial nature, she notes that the ''Steaua'' of the mid 1960s (that is, during [[De-Stalinization]]) replaced its cult of Stalin with that of [[Vladimir Lenin]], and afterwards dropped most politicized content.&lt;ref name="mg(des)facem"/&gt; In autumn 1953, as [[Anatol E. Baconsky]] was facing a political investigation for having opened ''Steaua'' to non-political content, official critic [[Mihu Dragomir]] suggested that "maestro Emil Isac"'s contributions were a good poetic standard to follow, urging Baconsky to again endorse it.&lt;ref&gt;Selejan, p.256&lt;/ref&gt;

Several literary historians and critics have described the impact of Emil Isac's contributions in the work of other authors, beginning with those elements which were transferred into [[Adrian Maniu]]'s modernist poetry (in particular, Călinescu notes, the "pictorial" quality the two shared).&lt;ref name="gc702"/&gt; Among the young Symbolists outside Transylvania, Isac also found a follower in the [[Moldavia]]n-born poet [[Benjamin Fondane|Benjamin Fondane (Fundoianu)]], who mentioned his importance as a literary guide in several of his early articles for the cultural press.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ana-Maria Tomescu, [http://www.uab.ro/reviste_recunoscute/index.php?cale=2005 "Tradiţionalism, modernitate sau avangardă în poezia lui Barbu Fundoianu?"], in the [[1 Decembrie 1918 University, Alba Iulia|December 1 University of Alba Iulia]]'s [http://www.uab.ro/reviste_recunoscute/index.php?cale=philologica ''Philologica Yearbook''], 2005 (Vol. III), p.229, 232&lt;/ref&gt; Outside this context, Isac was the target of two [[epigram]]s by [[Cincinat Pavelescu]] (a poet who attended Symbolist circles): connecting his visit to [[Berlin]] with [[Ion Luca Caragiale]]'s death in the same city, they mockingly assert that Caragiale would rather die than have to greet the young poet.&lt;ref name="cpluiemil"/&gt;

Isac's early commitment to radical and cosmopolitan aesthetics, generally perceived as alien by his more nationalist colleagues in Transylvania, left few traces in Isac's native region before [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="unifiisac"/&gt; However, through his eventual synthesis of modernism and traditionalism, Isac is credited with having created a school of Transylvanian poets, whose careers spanned the 20th century. This was in particular noted by Călinescu, who found that Isac's "prosaic, abrupt" use of poetic language had been assimilated, alongside echoes from [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Russian Symbolism]], into the early works of Aron Cotruş.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.841&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, researcher Carmina Tămăzlăcaru speaks of Cotruş's poems as being in the line of Goga and Isac, but modifying it through the adoption of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Carmina Tămăzlăcaru, [http://www.uab.ro/reviste_recunoscute/index.php?cale=2005_tom2 "Lirica lui Aron Cotruş"], in the [[1 Decembrie 1918 University, Alba Iulia|December 1 University of Alba Iulia]]'s [http://www.uab.ro/reviste_recunoscute/index.php?cale=philologica ''Philologica Yearbook''], 2005 (Vol. I), p.356, 358&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gheorghe Grigurcu, Isac's poetic language made possible the development of a "cosmic perspective" in Transylvanian poetry, adopted by the traditionalist-modernist ''[[Gândirea]]'' contributor [[Lucian Blaga]], and later by ''Steaua'' poet [[Aurel Rău]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/poezia_lui_aurel_ru "Poezia lui Aurel Rău"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 35/2009&lt;/ref&gt; The links between Isac and Blaga had earlier been noted by Călinescu, who suggested that the innovative elements in ''Maica cea tânără'' already announce the "stylized iconography" of Blaga's works for the stage, "which is in effect a Transylvanian perspective on things".&lt;ref name="gc702"/&gt; Gigurcu also notes that Isac's influence in [[Maramureş]] was eventually reflected in the poems of [[Gheorghe Pârja]], in what concerns their common view of the rural-urban confrontation.&lt;ref name="ggpoeti"/&gt;

Emil Isac's work was published in several new editions during the decades after his death. Such volumes enlisted contributions from several authors and critics of the day: Ion Brad, [[Veronica Porumbacu]], [[György Rába]], [[Elemér Jancsó]], [[Mircea Zaciu]], [[Mircea Tomuş]], [[Ion Oarcăsu]], [[Leon Baconsky]], [[Dumitru Micu]], [[Constantin Ciopraga]] etc.&lt;ref name="bjcrefer"/&gt; His contributions were gathered into a definitive Hungarian-language translation, printed in Bucharest in 1962, while his correspondence with Hungarian intellectuals was issued as Hungarian-language magazines and separate volumes, in both Romania and Hungary.&lt;ref name="bjcoperarefer"/&gt; His various poems were included into several [[Anthology|anthologies]] of Romanian poetry, or published individually, in [[Argentina]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], the [[Soviet Union]] ([[Russian SFSR]], [[Armenian SSR]]), and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="bjcopera"/&gt;

Isac's name was assigned to an avenue in Cluj, and his family home, located on that road, was opened as a memorial museum in 1955.&lt;ref name="mgpeisaj"/&gt; The poet was survived by his son, Dan Isac. A historian and writer, he joined the academic staff of [[Babeş-Bolyai University]],&lt;ref name="mgpeisaj"/&gt; and notably edited his father's correspondence with [[Vasile Goldiş]].&lt;ref name="bjcrefer"/&gt; During the final, [[National communism|national communist]], stage of the Romanian regime, Dan Isac was reportedly made a target of censorship for his alleged closeness to the [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarian-Romanian community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ştefan Borbély]], [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=10249 "Cu jalba-n proţap"], in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 4/2008 (republished by the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ ''România Culturală''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=September 2, 2011 }}); retrieved April 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Isac's legacy was touched by the fall of Romanian communism during the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]]. His memorial home was effectively disestablished in 2001, following an administrative decision of the [[Cluj County]] Council, and the cultural items in its patrimony were transferred to the Octavian Goga County Library.&lt;ref name="mgpeisaj"/&gt; However, in autumn 2004, Isac was one of the contributors whose work was paid homage to in ''Steaua'' magazine's 50th anniversary issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/REVISTE-STRAINE-La-lettre.-DE-ICI-DE-COLO-Steaua-Apostrof-Media-expres.-Info-Congres*articleID_12019-articles_details.html "Reviste străne: ''La lettre''.

      <comment>/* As structural transformations */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33077">In [[functional programming]], '''fold''' (also termed '''reduce''', '''accumulate''', '''aggregate''', '''compress''', or '''inject''') refers to a family of [[higher-order function]]s that [[analysis|analyze]] a [[Recursive data type|recursive]] data structure and through use of a given combining operation, recombine the results of [[recursion|recursively]] processing its constituent parts, building up a return value. Typically, a fold is presented with a combining [[Subroutine|function]], a top [[Node (computer science)|node]] of a [[data structure]], and possibly some default values to be used under certain conditions. The fold then proceeds to combine elements of the data structure's [[hierarchy]], using the function in a systematic way.

Folds are in a sense dual to [[Unfold (higher-order function)|unfolds]], which take a ''seed'' value and apply a function [[corecursion|corecursively]] to decide how to progressively construct a [[corecursive]] data structure, whereas a fold recursively breaks that structure down, replacing it with the results of applying a combining function at each node on its [[Terminal and nonterminal symbols|terminal]] values and the recursive results ([[catamorphism]], versus [[anamorphism]] of unfolds).

==As structural transformations==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
Folds can be regarded as consistently replacing the structural components of a data structure with functions and values. [[List (computing)|Lists]], for example, are built up in many functional languages from two primitives: any list is either an empty list, commonly called ''nil''&amp;thinsp; (&lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;), or is constructed by prefixing an element in front of another list, creating what is called a ''[[cons]]''&amp;thinsp; [[Node (computer science)|node]] (&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt; Cons(X1,Cons(X2,Cons(...(Cons(Xn,nil)))))&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;), resulting from application of a &lt;code&gt;cons&lt;/code&gt; function, written down as &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt; (colon) in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]. One can view a fold on lists as ''replacing''&amp;thinsp; the ''nil'' at the end of the list with a specific value, and ''replacing'' each ''cons'' with a specific function. These replacements can be viewed as a diagram:

[[Image:right-fold-transformation.png|center]]

There's another way to perform the structural transformation in a consistent manner, with the order of the two links of each node flipped when fed into the combining function:

[[Image:left-fold-transformation.png|center]]

These pictures illustrate [[#Folds on lists|''right'' and ''left'' fold of a list]] visually. They also highlight the fact that &lt;code&gt;foldr (:) []&lt;/code&gt; is the identity function on lists (a ''shallow copy'' in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] parlance), as replacing ''cons'' with &lt;code&gt;cons&lt;/code&gt; and ''nil'' with &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; will not change the result. The left fold diagram suggests an easy way to reverse a list, &lt;code&gt;foldl (flip (:)) []&lt;/code&gt;. Note that the parameters to cons must be flipped, because the element to add is now the right hand parameter of the combining function. Another easy result to see from this vantage-point is to write the higher-order [[Map (higher-order function)|map function]] in terms of &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt;, by composing the function to act on the elements with &lt;code&gt;cons&lt;/code&gt;, as:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 map f = foldr ((:) . f) []
&lt;/source&gt;

where the period (.) is an operator denoting [[Function composition (computer science)|function composition]].

This way of looking at things provides a simple route to designing fold-like functions on other [[algebraic data type]]s and structures, like various sorts of trees. One writes a function which recursively replaces the constructors of the datatype with provided functions, and any constant values of the type with provided values. Such a function is generally referred to as a [[catamorphism]].

==On lists==
The folding of the list &lt;code&gt;[1,2,3,4,5]&lt;/code&gt; with the addition operator would result in 15, the sum of the elements of the list &lt;code&gt;[1,2,3,4,5]&lt;/code&gt;. To a rough approximation, one can think of this fold as replacing the commas in the list with the + operation, giving &lt;code&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5&lt;/code&gt;.

In the example above, + is an [[associative operation]], so the final result will be the same regardless of parenthesization, although the specific way in which it is calculated will be different. In the general case of non-associative binary functions, the order in which the elements are combined may influence the final result's value. On lists, there are two obvious ways to carry this out: either by combining the first element with the result of recursively combining the rest (called a '''right fold'''), or by combining the result of recursively combining all elements but the last one, with the last element (called a '''left fold'''). This corresponds to a binary ''operator'' being either right-associative or left-associative, in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]'s or [[Prolog]]'s terminology. With a right fold, the sum would be parenthesized as &lt;code&gt;1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + 5)))&lt;/code&gt;, whereas with a left fold it would be parenthesized as &lt;code&gt;(((1 + 2) + 3) + 4) + 5&lt;/code&gt;.

In practice, it is convenient and natural to have an initial value which in the case of a right fold is used when one reaches the end of the list, and in the case of a left fold is what is initially combined with the first element of the list. In the example above, the value 0 (the [[additive identity]]) would be chosen as an initial value, giving &lt;code&gt;1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + (5 + 0))))&lt;/code&gt; for the right fold, and &lt;code&gt;((((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) + 4) + 5&lt;/code&gt; for the left fold. For multiplication, an initial choice of 0 wouldn't work: &lt;code&gt;0 * 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 0&lt;/code&gt;. The [[identity element]] for multiplication is 1. This would give us the outcome &lt;code&gt;1 * 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120 = 5!&lt;/code&gt;. 

===Linear vs. tree-like folds===
The use of an initial value is necessary when the combining function ''f''&amp;thinsp; is asymmetrical in its types, i.e., when the type of its result is different from the type of list's elements. Then an initial value must be used, with the same type as that of ''f''&amp;thinsp;'s result, for a ''linear'' chain of applications to be possible. Whether it will be left- or right-oriented will be determined by the types expected of its arguments by the combining function. If it is the second argument that must be of the same type as the result, then ''f''&amp;thinsp; could be seen as a binary operation that ''associates on the right'', and vice versa.

When the function is symmetrical in its types and the result type is the same as the list elements' type, the parentheses may be placed in arbitrary fashion thus creating a ''tree'' of nested sub-expressions, e.g., &lt;code&gt;((1 + 2) + (3 + 4)) + 5&lt;/code&gt;. If the binary operation ''f''&amp;thinsp; is associative this value will be well-defined, i.e., same for any parenthesization, although the operational details of how it is calculated will be different. This can have significant impact on efficiency if ''f''&amp;thinsp; is [[non-strict semantics|non-strict]].

Whereas linear folds are [[Recursion (computer science)#Recursive data structures (structural recursion)|node-oriented]] and operate in a consistent manner for each [[Node (computer science)|node]] of a [[List (computing)|list]], tree-like folds are whole-list oriented and operate in a consistent manner across ''groups'' of nodes.

===Special folds for non-empty lists===
One often wants to choose the [[identity element]] of the operation ''f'' as the initial value ''z''. When no initial value seems appropriate, for example, when one wants to fold the function which computes the maximum of its two parameters over a non-empty list to get the maximum element of the list, there are variants of &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt; which use the last and first element of the list respectively as the initial value. In Haskell and several other languages, these are called &lt;code&gt;foldr1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foldl1&lt;/code&gt;, the 1 making reference to the automatic provision of an initial element, and the fact that the lists they are applied to must have at least one element.

These folds use type-symmetrical binary operation: the types of both its arguments, and its result, must be the same. Richard Bird in his 2010 book proposes&lt;ref name="foldrn"&gt;Richard Bird, "Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design", Cambridge University Press 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-521-51338-8}}, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; "a general fold function on non-empty lists" &lt;code&gt;foldrn&lt;/code&gt; which transforms its last element, by applying an additional argument function to it, into a value of the result type before starting the folding itself, and is thus able to use type-asymmetrical binary operation like the regular &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; to produce a result of type different from the list's elements type.

===Implementation===

====Linear folds====
Using Haskell as an example, &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; can be formulated in a few equations.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 foldl :: (b -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b
 foldl f z []     = z
 foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (f z x) xs
&lt;/source&gt;

If the list is empty, the result is the initial value. If not, fold the tail of the list using as new initial value the result of applying f to the old initial value and the first element.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 foldr :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b
 foldr f z []     = z
 foldr f z (x:xs) = f x (foldr f z xs)
&lt;/source&gt;

If the list is empty, the result is the initial value z. If not, apply f to the first element and the result of folding the rest.

====Tree-like folds====
Lists can be folded over in a tree-like fashion, both for finite and for indefinitely defined lists:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
foldt f z []     = z
foldt f z [x]    = f x z
foldt f z xs     = foldt f z (pairs f xs)
 
foldi f z []     = z
foldi f z (x:xs) = f x (foldi f z (pairs f xs))
 
pairs f (x:y:t)  = f x y : pairs f t
pairs _ t        = t
&lt;/source&gt;

In the case of &lt;code&gt;foldi&lt;/code&gt; function, to avoid its runaway evaluation on ''indefinitely'' defined lists the function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; must ''not always'' demand its second argument's value, at least not all of it, and/or not immediately (see [[#Examples|example]] below).

==== Folds for non-empty lists ====

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
foldl1 f [x]      = x
foldl1 f (x:y:xs) = foldl1 f (f x y : xs)

foldr1 f [x]      = x
foldr1 f (x:xs)   = f x (foldr1 f xs)

foldt1 f [x]      = x
foldt1 f (x:y:xs) = foldt1 f (f x y : pairs f xs)
 
foldi1 f [x]      = x
foldi1 f (x:xs)   = f x (foldi1 f (pairs f xs))
&lt;/source&gt;

===Evaluation order considerations===

In the presence of [[lazy evaluation|lazy]], or [[non-strict semantics|non-strict]] evaluation, &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; will immediately return the application of ''f'' to the head of the list and the recursive case of folding over the rest of the list. Thus, if ''f'' is able to produce some part of its result without reference to the recursive case on its "right" i.e., in its ''second'' argument, and the rest of the result is never demanded, then the recursion will stop (e.g., {{code|1=head == foldr (\a b-&gt;a) (error "empty list")|2=haskell}}). This allows right folds to operate on infinite lists. By contrast, &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt; will immediately call itself with new parameters until it reaches the end of the list. This [[tail recursion]] can be efficiently compiled as a loop, but can't deal with infinite lists at all — it will recurse forever in an [[infinite loop]].

Having reached the end of the list, an ''expression'' is in effect built by &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt; of nested left-deepening &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;-applications, which is then presented to the caller to be evaluated. Were the function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; to refer to its second argument first here, and be able to produce some part of its result without reference to the recursive case (here, on its ''left'' i.e., in its ''first'' argument), then the recursion would stop. This means that while &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; recurses ''on the right'', it allows for a lazy combining function to inspect list's elements from the left; and conversely, while &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt; recurses ''on the left'', it allows for a lazy combining function to inspect list's elements from the right, if it so chooses (e.g., {{code|1=last == foldl (\a b-&gt;b) (error "empty list")|2=haskell}}).

Reversing a list is also tail-recursive (it can be implemented using {{code|1=rev = foldl (\ys x -&gt; x : ys) []|2=haskell}}). On ''finite'' lists, that means that left-fold and reverse can be composed to perform a right fold in a tail-recursive way (cf.&amp;thinsp; {{code|1=1+&gt;(2+&gt;(3+&gt;0)) == ((0&lt;+3)&lt;+2)&lt;+1|2=haskell}}), with a modification to the function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; so it reverses the order of its arguments (i.e., {{code|1=foldr f z == foldl (flip f) z . foldl (flip (:)) []|2=haskell}}), tail-recursively building a representation of expression that right-fold would build. The extraneous intermediate list structure can be eliminated with the [[continuation-passing style]] technique, {{code|1=foldr f z xs == foldl (\k x-&gt; k . f x) id xs z|2=haskell}}; similarly, {{code|1=foldl f z xs == foldr (\x k-&gt; k . flip f x) id xs z|2=haskell}} (&amp;thinsp;&lt;code&gt;flip&lt;/code&gt; is only needed in languages like Haskell with its flipped order of arguments to the combining function of &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt; unlike e.g., in Scheme where the same order of arguments is used for combining functions to both &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt; and {{code|1=foldr|2=haskell}}).

Another technical point is that, in the case of left folds using lazy evaluation, the new initial parameter is not being evaluated before the recursive call is made. This can lead to stack overflows when one reaches the end of the list and tries to evaluate the resulting potentially gigantic expression. For this reason, such languages often provide a stricter variant of left folding which forces the evaluation of the initial parameter before making the recursive call. In Haskell this is the &lt;code&gt;foldl'&lt;/code&gt; (note the apostrophe, pronounced 'prime') function in the &lt;code&gt;Data.List&lt;/code&gt; library (one needs to be aware of the fact though that forcing a value built with a lazy data constructor won't force its constituents automatically by itself). Combined with tail recursion, such folds approach the efficiency of loops, ensuring constant space operation, when lazy evaluation of the final result is impossible or undesirable.

===Examples===
Using a [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] interpreter, the structural transformations which fold functions perform can be illustrated by constructing a string:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
λ&gt; foldr (\x y -&gt; concat ["(",x,"+",y,")"]) "0" (map show [1..13])
"(1+(2+(3+(4+(5+(6+(7+(8+(9+(10+(11+(12+(13+0)))))))))))))"
 
λ&gt; foldl (\x y -&gt; concat ["(",x,"+",y,")"]) "0" (map show [1..13])
"(((((((((((((0+1)+2)+3)+4)+5)+6)+7)+8)+9)+10)+11)+12)+13)"
 
λ&gt; foldt (\x y -&gt; concat ["(",x,"+",y,")"]) "0" (map show [1..13])
"(((((1+2)+(3+4))+((5+6)+(7+8)))+(((9+10)+(11+12))+13))+0)"
 
λ&gt; foldi (\x y -&gt; concat ["(",x,"+",y,")"]) "0" (map show [1..13])
"(1+((2+3)+(((4+5)+(6+7))+((((8+9)+(10+11))+(12+13))+0))))"
&lt;/source&gt;

Infinite tree-like folding is demonstrated e.g., in [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] primes production by [[Sieve of Eratosthenes#Incremental sieve|unbounded sieve of Eratosthenes]] in [[Haskell features#Prime numbers|Haskell]]:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
primes = 2 : _Y ((3 :) . minus [5,7..] . foldi (\(x:xs) ys -&gt; x : union xs ys) [] 
                       . map (\p-&gt; [p*p, p*p+2*p..]))
_Y g = g (_Y g)     -- = g . g . g . g . ...
&lt;/source&gt;
where the function [[Haskell features#union|&lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt;]] operates on ordered lists in a local manner to efficiently produce their [[Union (set theory)|set union]], and [[Haskell features#minus|&lt;code&gt;minus&lt;/code&gt;]] their [[Complement (set theory)#Relative complement|set difference]].

For finite lists, e.g., [[merge sort]] (and its duplicates-removing variety, &lt;code&gt;nubsort&lt;/code&gt;) could be easily defined using tree-like folding as
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
mergesort xs = foldt merge [] [[x] | x &lt;- xs]
nubsort   xs = foldt union [] [[x] | x &lt;- xs]
&lt;/source&gt;
with the function [[Haskell 98 features#Mergesort|&lt;code&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt;]] a duplicates-preserving variant of &lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt;.

Functions &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt; could have been defined through folding as
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
head = foldr (\x r -&gt; x) (error "head: Empty list")
last = foldl (\a x -&gt; x) (error "last: Empty list")
&lt;/source&gt;

==Universality==
Fold is a [[Type polymorphism|polymorphic]] function. For any ''g'' having a definition

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 g [] = v
 g (x:xs) = f x (g xs)
&lt;/source&gt;

then ''g'' can be expressed as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |accessdate= March 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
 g = foldr f v
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Foodo''' ([[ISO 639-3]] fod) is a [[Guang language]] spoken in and around the town of [[Sèmèrè]] in the north of [[Benin]]. There are approximately 37,000 speakers (taking the most recent estimate and adding the estimated 3.2% a year growth rate for [[Benin]]&lt;ref&gt;Alexandratos, N. (ed.) (1995). World Agriculture Towards 2010: An FAO Study. New York: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;). A large proportion of the population live beyond the homeland in other parts of [[Benin]], as well as in neighboring [[Togo]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Ghana]]. There may be as many as 1,000 living in [[Ghana]].

The language has its origin in [[Ghana]]. Approximately 200 to 300 years ago, a group of [[Guang languages|Guang]] speakers migrated from the south of [[Ghana]] to [[Sèmèrè]] along the ancient cola trade route which extended through [[Togo]] and [[Benin]] to [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornevin, Robert. 1964. Contribution à l'etude des populations parlant des langues gouang au Togo et au Dahomey. Journal of African Languages 3:226-230.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bertho, J. 1951. Trois îlots linguistiques du Moyen-Dahomey: le Tshummbuli, le Bazantché, et le Basila. Bulletin de l'Institut Français d'Afrique Noire, 13:872-892.&lt;/ref&gt; The various origins of Foodo speakers are still retained in clan names." &lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, Gray C. 2009. An overview of Foodo, a linguistic island in Benin. Journal of West African Languages, 36:1-2.107-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociolinguistic background==
Foodo is one of the [[national language]]s of [[Benin]]. In the [[Beninese]] sociopolitical context 'national language' is interpreted to mean all [[African language]]s spoken within the borders of the country. 

The Foodo have close historical and cultural links through [[Islam]] to the [[Tem (Togo tribe)|Tem]] (often known as [[Kotokoli]]), in and around the town of [[Sokode]] in [[Togo]]. Many Foodo are bilingual in [[Tem language|Tem]] as a [[trade language]].

===Tones===
Foodo is a [[tonal language]], meaning that [[pitch accent|pitch]] differences are used to distinguish one word from another. These contrasts may be [[exical form|lexical]] or [[grammatical]].

There are two [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s, High (H) and Low (L).

Foodo also has automatic [[downstep]], where a H following a L is always pronounced on a lower [[pitch (music)|pitch]] than the preceding H within the same [[phonological phrase]]. Numerous [[tonal processes]] occur once words are placed in context.&lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, Gray C. (1991). The tone system of Foodo nouns: University of North Dakota. Masters thesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syllable structure===
In underlying forms, there are five possible [[syllable]] types: CV, CV:, CVV, CVC, V and VC. Except for some [[pronominal]] forms, both V and VC are limited to [[affix]]es. The only [[consonant]]s which occur in the coda position are [[nasal stop|nasals]]. &lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, Gray C. 2009. An overview of Foodo, a linguistic island in Benin. Journal of West African Languages, 36:1-2.114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowel harmony===
Foodo has [[vowel harmony]]. All [[vowels]] in the [[Word stem|stem]] agree in regard to their [[Advanced tongue root|ATR]] quality. [[Prefix]]es and most [[suffix]]es receive their [[Advanced tongue root|ATR]] feature from the [[Advanced tongue root|ATR]] quality of the [[Word stem|stem]]. There is also some [[rounding]] [[vowel harmony]] in [[nouns]], but this is more restrictive and often varies between speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, Gray C. 2009. An overview of Foodo, a linguistic island in Benin. Journal of West African Languages, 36:1-2.112.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
The Foodo [[orthography]] uses modified [[Roman script]], adding various characters to represent sounds that do not occur in [[European languages]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"&gt;Zakari, Aboubakari &amp; Gray Plunkett (1998). Guide pour lire et écrire le foodo, édition préliminaire. Sèmèrè par Djougou, Bénin: Commission Nationale de Linguistique Foodo en collaboration avec SIL.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consonants===

===Vowels===

===Tones===
The Foodo [[orthography]] marks an [[acute accent]] on the first [[syllable]] of the [[word]] if that [[syllable]] is H tone, and leaves all other [[syllable]]s unmarked. e.g.á é ɛ́ í ɩ́ ó ɔ́ ú ʊ́&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;

==Grammar==

===Noun classes===
Foodo has ten [[noun class]]es. Most [[noun]]s consist of a [[Word stem|stem]] with a [[noun class]] [[prefix]] and a [[noun class]] [[suffix]]. But it is more helpful to speak of classification being based on [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] patterns rather than just on the form of a single [[affix]]. [[Noun]]s are grouped into different sets which share common [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] phenomena within the [[noun phrase]] and on concordant [[anaphoric pronoun]]s outside the [[noun phrase]]. The [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] on [[noun class]] [[prefix]]es behaves similarly to other [[Guang languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Snider, Keith 1990b. Tone in proto-Guang nouns. African Languages and Cultures 3.1:87-105&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syntax===
Foodo is an [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]] language. [[Adverbial phrases]] are generally [[clause]] final. The order of [[morphemes]] within a verbal word is: [[subject (grammar)|subject]] [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] [[clitic]] — [[Affirmative and negative|negative]] marker — [[Tense–aspect–mood|TAM]] — [[verb]] [[Word stem|stem]] — directional]. &lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, Gray C. 2009.

'''"I'll give you my gun when you pry''' (or '''take''') '''it from my cold, dead hands"''' is a [[slogan]] popularized by the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) on a series of [[bumper sticker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/movies/06heston.html?_r=1&amp;bl&amp;ex=1207713600&amp;en=55b5ab5e7044b201&amp;ei=5087%0A&amp;oref=slogin Charlton Heston death announcement] - New York Times, April 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OyYRAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=intitle:%22McCarthy's+list%22+%22'LL+GIVE+UP+MY+GUN+WHEN+THEY+PRY+IT+OUT+OF+MY+COLD+DEAD+HANDS,+my+father's+bumper%22&amp;dq=intitle:%22McCarthy's+list%22+%22'LL+GIVE+UP+MY+GUN+WHEN+THEY+PRY+IT+OUT+OF+MY+COLD+DEAD+HANDS,+my+father's+bumper%22&amp;pgis=1 Excerpt from Mary Mackey's ''McCarthy's List'' (1979)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a variation of a slogan mentioned in a 1976 report from the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] [[Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency]]: "I Will Give Up My Gun When They Peel My Cold Dead Fingers From Around It."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WIodq3JVfisC&amp;q=%22Cold+Dead+Fingers%22+Subcommittee&amp;dq=%22Cold+Dead+Fingers%22+Subcommittee&amp;pgis=1 Excerpt from 1976 report from Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency] - p. 2221&lt;/ref&gt; The original version did not originate with the NRA, but with another [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]] group, the [[Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms]], based in [[Bellevue, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccrkba.org/|title=The Common Sense Gun Lobby Citizens Committee For The Right To Keep And Bear Arms|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It, along with "If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns", is a slogan that is often used by gun owners and their supporters in discussions of [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control in the United States]].

==Use by Charlton Heston==
A year after the [[Columbine High School massacre]], the phrase gained newfound popularity following the 129th NRA convention, in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] on May 20, 2000, when the actor, and president at the time of the NRA, [[Charlton Heston]] ended a speech by concluding:

{{quote|For the next six months, &amp;#91;[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[President of the United States|presidential]] candidate and then-[[Vice President of the United States]], [[Al Gore]]] is going to smear you as the enemy. He will slander you as gun-toting, knuckle-dragging, bloodthirsty maniacs who stand in the way of a safer America. Will you remain silent? I will not remain silent. If we are going to stop this, then it is vital to every law-abiding gun owner in America to register to vote and show up at the polls on Election Day.}}

Heston then paused to pick up a replica of a flintlock [[long rifle]] and continued:&lt;ref&gt;[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/052100nra-gore.html N.R.A. leaders cast Gore as archenemy] - ''[[New York Times]]'' article, May 20, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|So, as we set out this year to defeat the divisive forces that would take freedom away, I want to say those fighting words for everyone within the sound of my voice to hear and to heed, and especially for you, ''Mr. Gore'': 'From my cold, dead hands!'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ju4Gla2odw|title=Charlton Heston; From My Cold Dead Hands. Long Version|date=26 April 2008|work=YouTube|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; |personquoted=Charlton Heston, May 20, 2000}}

Heston repeated the phrase at the end of each NRA convention over which he presided. When he announced his retirement in 2003, he concluded by repeating "From my cold, dead hands."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=%5CNation%5Carchive%5C200304%5CNAT20030425f.html "Heston to Step down as NRA President"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411010418/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=%5CNation%5Carchive%5C200304%5CNAT20030425f.html |date=2008-04-11 }}, The Nation, April 25, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in American politics==
The phrase has been used by numerous pro-gun rights groups including The [[National Rifle Association]], [[National Association for Gun Rights]]. The term also lends itself to the Second Amendment for-profit corporation Cold Dead Hands.

==Media appearances==
In the 1984 film ''[[Red Dawn]]'', Communist paratroopers invade middle United States. A bumper sticker with the statement on it is shown, and then the camera pans to an [[M1911A1]] pistol clutched in its dead owner's hand. One of the paratroopers literally takes the gun from his dead hands, shoves it in his own belt, and then leaves.

In the 1997 film ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'', Edgar, an upstate New York farmer, tells a recently landed alien when asked to drop his shotgun, "You can have my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers." The alien responds, "Your proposal is acceptable." Edgar is then killed, and the alien uses his skin as a disguise.

The phrase is used to introduce Heston (and thence his NRA experience) to viewers of [[Michael Moore]]'s 2002 documentary film ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]''.

In 2005, the phrase was parodied by ''[[The Onion]]'' in their "300th Anniversary" issue dated June 22, 2056. A small item on the page claimed: "Grave robbers pry valuable rifle from Charlton Heston's cold, dead hands".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theonion.com/2056-06-22/ The Onion 2056] - Popular monocultures box (wait for the text to cycle round)&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2008, shortly after Charlton Heston's death, ''The Onion'' again parodied the phrase in a photo caption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/from_print/charlton_hestons_gun_taken|title=Charlton Heston's Gun Taken From His Cold, Dead Hands|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 update ''Mann vs Machine'' for the video game ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' contains a parody of the phrase as one of the Soldier character responses: "You can have this when you pry it from my cold, dead hands. And even then, good luck! Because I will have glued it to my cold, dead hands!"&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Soldier_responses#After_a_Wave Soldier responses - Official TF2 Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Jim Carrey]] with [[Eels (band)|The Eels]] created a single and accompanying music video "[[Cold Dead Hand]]", ridiculing [[gun culture in the United States]] and specifically Charlton Heston, declaring that he could not enter Heaven as even angels could not pry the gun from his hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author= |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/jim-carrey-eels-team-for-gun-culture-parody-20130325 |title=Video: Jim Carrey, Eels Team for Gun Culture Parody |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/watch-jim-carrey-mocks-gun-rights-advocates-new-video-article-1.1298481 |title=Jim Carrey releases 'Cold Dead Hand' music video mocking gun rights advocates like Charlton Heston |publisher=NY Daily News |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2013-03-30 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony Jeselnik]], on his 2013 TV show, ''The Jeselnik Offensive'', said, "They can have my gun when they pry it from my curious six-year-old's cold dead hands."

Contemporary typographers view typography as a craft with a very long [[history]] tracing its origins back to the first punches and dies used to make [[Seal (device)|seal]]s and [[currency]] in [[Ancient history|ancient times]]. The basic elements of typography are at least as old as [[civilization]] and the earliest [[writing system]]s&amp;mdash;a series of key developments that were eventually drawn together into one, systematic craft.

__TOC__

==Medieval design roots==
[[File:Gutenberg bible Old Testament Epistle of St Jerome.jpg|thumb|top|200px|First page of the first volume of the [[Gutenberg Bible]], printed with an early [[textualis|textur]] typeface c. 1455. In this copy the [[decorative]] colored initials were [[calligraphy|hand-lettered]] separately by a scribe.]]

Typography, type-founding and typeface design began as closely related crafts in mid-15th-century Europe with the introduction of [[movable type]] [[Printing press|printing]] at the junction of the medieval era and the [[Renaissance]]. Handwritten letterforms of the mid-15th century embodied 3000&amp;nbsp;years of evolved letter design, and were the natural models for letterforms in systematized typography. The scribal letter known as ''[[textualis|textur]]'' or ''textualis'', produced by the strong [[Gothic art|gothic]] spirit of [[blackletter]] from the hands of German area scribes, served as the model for the first text types.

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] employed the [[scribe]] [[Peter Schöffer]] to help design and cut the letterpunches for the first typeface&amp;mdash;the [[D-K type]] of 202 characters used to print the first printed books in Europe. A second typeface of about 300 characters designed for the [[Gutenberg Bible|42-line Bible]] c. 1455 was probably cut by the goldsmith Hans Dunne with the help of two others&amp;mdash;Götz von Shlettstadt and [[Hans von Speyer]].

Cultural tradition ensured that German typography and type design remained true to the gothic/blackletter spirit; but the parallel influence of the humanist and neo-classical typography in Italy (the second country where movable type printing was done) catalyzed textur into four additional sub-styles that were distinct, structurally rich and highly disciplined: [[Bastarda]], [[Fraktur (typeface sub-classification)|fraktur]], [[Rotunda (script)|rotunda]], and [[Schwabacher]].

The rapid spread of movable type printing across Europe produced additional Gothic, half-Gothic and Gothic-to-Roman transitional types. [[Johann Bämler]]'s Schwabacher, [[Augsburg (typeface)|Augsburg]] appeared in 1474. The half-Gothic Rotunda type of [[Erhard Ratdolt]] c. 1486 was cut to suit [[Venice|Venetian]] taste. In 1476 [[William Caxton]], having learned his craft on the Continent, printed the first books in England with a so-called Bâtarde type (an early Schwabacher design), but soon abandoned it.

The early printers of Spain were Germans who began by printing in up-to-date roman types but soon gave these up and adopted Gothic typefaces based on the letterforms of Spanish manuscripts. [[Valencia]] in the Kingdom of Aragon was the location of the first press, established in 1473. From there printers moved to other cities to set up presses. Roman types were used by the printers of Salamanca for their editions of classical authors. Printing in Portuguese began at Lisbon in 1495 (the first book printed in Portugal was a Hebrew book printed in 1489).&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, S. H. (1961) ''Five Hundred Years of Printing''. Harmondsworth: Penguin; pp. 94, 96, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical revival==
In [[Italy]] the heavy gothic styles were soon displaced by ''Venetian'' or "old style" Latin types, also called [[Antiqua (typeface class)|antiqua]]. The [[Roman square capitals|inscriptional capitals]] on [[ancient Rome|Roman]] buildings and [[monument]]s were structured on a [[Euclidean geometry|euclidean]] [[geometry|geometric]] scheme and the [[Classical order|discrete component-based model]] of [[classical architecture]]. Their structurally perfect design, near-perfect execution in stone, balanced angled stressing, contrasting thick and thin strokes, and incised [[serif]]s became the typographic ideal for [[Western culture|western civilization]]. The best-known example of Roman [[Roman square capitals|inscriptional capitals]] exists on the base of Trajan's Column, inscribed c. 113.

[[File:Trajan inscription duotone.jpg|thumb|center|580px|'''[[Roman square capitals|Roman inscriptional capitals]]''' on the base of '''[[Trajan's Column]]''', c. 113.]]

In their enthusiastic [[Neoclassicism|revival of classical culture]], Italian scribes and [[Humanism|humanist]] scholars of the early 15th century searched for ancient lower case letters to match the Roman inscriptional capitals. Practically all of the available manuscripts of classical writers had been rewritten during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], and with a lapse of three hundred years since the widespread use of this style, the humanist scribes mistook [[Carolingian minuscule]] as the authentic writing style of the ancients. Dubbing it ''lettera antica'', they began by copying the minuscule hand almost exactly, combining it with Roman capitals in the same manner as the manuscripts they were copying.&lt;ref name="nesbitt"&gt;Nesbitt, Alexander ''The History and Technique of Lettering'' (c) 1957, [[Dover Publications|Dover Publications, Inc.]] {{ISBN|0-486-20427-8}}  {{OCLC|654540}}. The Dover edition is an abridged and corrected republication of the work originally published in 1950 by Prentice-Hall, Inc. under the title ''Lettering: The History and Technique of Lettering as Design''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carolingian sample.png|thumb|center|538px|'''Sample of Carolingian writing''' from the [[Carolingian Gospel Book (British Library, MS Add. 11848)|Carolingian Gospel Book produced between 820 and 830 AD]]]]

Upon noticing the stylistic mismatch between these two very different letters, the scribes redesigned the small Carolingian letter, lengthening ascenders and descenders, and adding incised serifs and finishing strokes to integrate them with the Roman capitals. By the time [[movable type|moveable type]] reached Italy several decades later, the humanistic writing had evolved into a consistent model known as [[Humanist minuscule|humanistic minuscule]], which served as the basis for type style we know today as Venetian.&lt;ref name="nesbitt"/&gt;

==Transition from humanistic minuscule to roman type==
The classically endowed city of [[Rome]] attracted the first printers known to have set up shop outside Germany, [[Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim]], closely followed by the brothers [[Johann and Wendelin of Speyer]] (de Spira), and the Frenchman [[Nicolas Jenson]]. The sequence of appearance and production dates for types used by these printers have yet to be established with certainty; all four are known to have printed with types ranging from textur Gothic to fully developed romans inspired by the earlier humanistic writing, and within a few years the center of printing in Italy shifted from Rome to [[Venice]].

Some time before 1472 in Venice, Johann and Wendelin issued material printed with a half-Gothic-half-roman type known as "Gotico-antiqua". This design paired simplified Gothic capitals with a rationalized humanistic minuscule letter set, itself combining Gothic minuscule forms with elements of Carolingian, in a one step forward, half step back blending of styles.

Around the same time (1468) in Rome, Pannartz and Sweynheim were using another typeface that closely mimicked humanistic minuscule, known as "Lactantius". Unlike the rigid fractured forms of Speyer's half-Gothic, the Lactantius is characterized by smoothly rendered letters with a restrained organic finish. The Lactantius '''a''' departed from both the Carolingian and Gothic models; a vertical backstem and right-angled top replaced the diagonal Carolingian structure, and a continuous curved stroke replaced the fractured Gothic bowl element.

For details on the evolution of lower case letterforms from Latin capitals, see [[Latin alphabet]].

==Development of roman type==
&lt;!-- "Whiteletter" in "Broadside (music)" links directly to this section. Please don't change the heading without doing the link as well—thanks. --&gt;[[Nicolas Jenson]] began printing in Venice with his original roman font from 1470. Jenson's design and the very similar roman types cut by [[Francesco Griffo]] c. 1499 and Erhard Ratdolt c. 1486 are acknowledged as the definitive and [[archetype|archetypal]] roman faces that set the pattern for the majority of western text faces that followed.

The Jenson roman was an explicitly typographic letter designed on its own terms that declined to imitate the appearance of hand-lettering. Its effect is one of a unified cohesive whole, a seamless fusion of style with structure, and the successful convergence of the long progression of preceding letter styles. Jenson adapted the structural unity and component-based modular integration of Roman capitals to humanistic minuscule forms by masterful [[Abstraction|abstract]] stylization. The carefully modelled [[serifs]] follow an artful [[logic]] of [[asymmetry]]. The [[ratio]] of extender lengths to letter bodies and the distance between lines results in balanced, harmonious body of type. Jenson also mirrors the ideal expressed in renaissance painting of carving up space (typographic "white space") with figures (letters) to articulate the relationship between the two and make the white space dynamic.

[[File:Jenson 1475 venice laertius.png|center|thumb|600px|'''[[Nicolas Jenson]]'s roman type''' used in Venice c. 1470. Later "old style" or Venetian book romans such as [[Aldus Manutius|Aldines]], and much later [[Bembo]], were closely based on Jenson.]]

The name "roman" is customarily applied uncapitalized to distinguish early Jenson and Aldine-derived types from classical Roman letters of antiquity. Some parts of Europe call roman "antiqua" from its connection with the humanistic "lettera antica"; "medieval" and "old-style" are also employed to indicate roman types dating from the late 15th century, especially those used by [[Aldus Manutius]] (Italian: Manuzio). Roman faces based on those of Speyer and Jenson are also called Venetian.

==Italic type==
The humanist spirit driving the Renaissance produced its own unique style of formal writing, known as "cursiva humanistica". This slanted and rapidly written letter evolved from humanistic minuscule and the remaining Gothic current cursive hands in Italy, served as the model for ''[[cursive]]'' or italic typefaces. As books printed with early roman types forced humanistic minuscule out of use, cursiva humanistica gained favor as a manuscript hand for the purpose of writing. The popularity of cursive writing itself may have created some demand for a type of this style. The more decisive catalyst was probably the printing of pocket editions of [[Latin literature|Latin classics]] by Aldus Manutius.

The "Aldino" italic type, commissioned by Manutius and cut by Francesco Griffo in 1499, was a closely spaced condensed type. Griffo's punches are a delicate translation of the Italian cursive hand, featuring letters of irregular slant angle and uneven height and vertical position, with some connected pairs (''[[Ligature (typography)|ligature]]s''), and unslanted small roman capitals the height of the lower case '''t'''. The fame of Aldus Manutius and his editions made the Griffo italic widely copied and influential, although it was not the finest of the pioneer italics. The "Aldino" style quickly became known as "italic" from its Italian origin.

Around 1527 the Vatican chancellery scribe [[Ludovico Arrighi]] designed a superior italic type and had the punches cut by Lauticio di Bartolomeo dei Rotelli. The more modular structure of Arrighi's italic and its few ligatures made it less a copy of the cursive hand than Griffo's. Its slightly taller roman capitals, a gentler slant angle, taller ascenders and wider separation of lines gave the elegant effect of refined handwriting.

[[File:Arrighi italic.png|center|thumb|600px|'''Italic type''' designed by Ludovico Arrighi, c. 1527. This elegant design inspired later French italic types.]]

Surviving examples of 16th-century Italian books indicate the bulk of them were printed with italic types. By mid-century the popularity of italic types for sustained text setting began to decline until they were used only for in-line citations, block quotes, preliminary text, emphasis, and abbreviations. Italic types from the 20th century up to the present are much indebted to Arrighi and his influence on French designers.

Swiss art historian [[Jakob Burckhardt]] described the classically inspired Renaissance ''modello'' of dual case roman and cursive italic types as "The model and ideal for the whole western world". Venetian pre-eminence in type design was brought to an end by the political and economic turmoil that concluded the Renaissance in Italy with the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome in 1527]].

==Renaissance Germany and Switzerland==
Soon after 1500, roman typefaces began to gain popularity north of the Alps for printing of Latin literature.  [[Johann Froben]] of [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] set up his press in 1491, and by about 1519 (when he printed [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]'s famous edition of the Greek [[New Testament]]) he had established a set of standards for humanistic printing which were widely copied throughout the German-speaking world and also in [[Spain]] and, to a lesser extent in England.  His principal type is wholly roman in the shape of the characters but retains an echo of gothic influence in the angled serifs and the way the thick and thin strokes are organized; it was coupled with mated sets of woodcut initials (often designed by distinguished artists) and with two larger sizes of uppercase letters for use in title pages and headings—Froben was the first to use such 'display faces' consistently, breaking away from the Italian tradition in which title pages and headings tended to be set in the same size as the main text.  By using these large faces, Froben developed the title page as a fully organized artistic whole. Froben's italic face is based on that of Aldus but more even and uniform in effect.  These Swiss books are the first to have been designed in every detail as printed artifacts rather than as adaptations of manuscript technique.

After about 1550 this Swiss/German tradition was gradually overwhelmed by French influence.  Towards the end of the 16th century, the [[Wechel]] family of [[Frankfurt]], previously based in Paris, was producing fine books which used French typefaces in conjunction with heavy but resplendent woodcut ornaments to achieve a splendid page effect;  but soon after 1600 there was a general, marked decline in the quality of both skill and materials, from which German printing did not recover until the 20th century.

==16th century France==
Typography was introduced to France by the German printers Martin Crantz, Michael Freyburger and Ulrich Gering, who set up a press in [[Paris]] in 1470, where they printed with an inferior copy of the Lactantius type. Gothic types dominated in France until the end of the 15th century, when they were gradually supplanted by roman designs. [[Jodocus Badius Ascensius]] (Josse Bade) in partnership with [[Henri Estienne]] established a press in Paris in 1503. Printing with undeveloped Roman and half-Gothic types, the French pair were too occupied meeting the demand for Humanistic and classical texts to design any original types of their own. French books nonetheless began to follow the format established by Italian printers, and [[Lyon]] and Paris became the new centers of activity. Eventually, the French government fixed a standard height for all type, to ensure that different batches could be used together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers|date=1765|location=Paris|pages=Vol. 8, p. 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===De Colines, Estienne, and Augereau===
After their 1494 invasion of Italy the French were greatly influenced by Renaissance culture, and later set about converting French culture from Gothic to neo-classical. The required phonetic and orthographic changes to French language hindered the evolution of type design in France until the late 1520s. At the end of this period roman types introduced by [[Robert Estienne]], [[Simon de Colines]] and Antoine Augereau began a phase of type design with a distinctly French character. Robert Estienne carried on the establishment of his father Henri Estienne, who had died in 1520. Simon de Colines had been the elder Estienne's assistant, married his widow, and set up his own press.

The de Colines roman of 1531 resembled Griffo's 1499 roman but did not copy it closely. Narrower forms and tighter letter fit; '''a''' with low angled bowl; elevated triangular stem serifs on '''i''', '''j''', '''m''', '''n''' and '''r'''; flattened [[baseline (typography)|baseline]] serifs, delicately modeled [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] serifs and graceful, fluid lines characterize the French style. Robert Estienne's roman of 1532 was similar to the de Colines face, which Estienne complemented with a fine italic type based on that of Arrighi. The craftsmen who cut the punches for the romans used by Estienne and de Colines remain unidentified. In 1532 Antoine Augereau cut the punches for a roman type very close to Estienne's. The lower cases of the Estienne and Augereau types became the basis for post-Renaissance old style typography, and were copied by French typographers for the next 150&amp;nbsp;years.

===Garamond===
[[File:GaramondSpecimenA.svg|right|thumb|200px|'''Garamond type''' revival by [[Robert Slimbach]].]]

The svelte French style reached its fullest refinement in the roman types attributed to the best-known figure of French typography&amp;mdash;[[Claude Garamond]] (also Garamont). In 1541 [[Robert Estienne]], printer to the king, helped Garamond obtain commissions to cut the sequence of Greek fonts for King [[Francis I of France]], known as the "[[grecs du roi]]". A number of roman faces used in Garamond's publishing activities can be positively attributed to him as punch-cutter. From the dates of their appearance, and their similarity to romans used by Estienne, [[Christoffel Plantijn]] and the printer André Wechel, the types known as "Canon de Garamond" and "Petit Canon de Garamond" shown on a specimen sheet issued by the Egenolff-Berner foundry in 1592 are generally accepted as [[Garamond|Claude Garamond's final roman types]].

===Robert Granjon===
[[File:Evangelium Sanctum Domini Nostri Jesu Christi in Arabic 1590 with Arabic types of Robert Grandjon Rome Typographia Medicea.jpg|thumb|left|''Evangelium Sanctum Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'' in [[Arabic]], 1590, with Arabic types of Robert Grandjon, ''[[Typographia Medicea]]'', [[Rome]].]]
[[Robert Granjon]] worked in the second half of the 16th century, mainly at Lyon, but was also recorded at Paris, Rome and [[Antwerp]]. He is still famous because of his [[Civilité]] types, imitating French gothic cursive calligraphy.  His main contribution was an italic type known as "Parangon de Granjon". Italic type design had apparently become corrupted since the Arrighi and Aldine models. Granjon's italic had a greater slant angle, slanted roman capitals, and reduced weight and rigor. These qualities and its contrasting thick and thin strokes gave it a dazzling appearance that made it difficult to read. It was nevertheless the main influence for italic type design until the Arrighi model was revived in 1920.

In the 16th century, Western printers also developed Oriental types, such as [[François Savary de Brèves]] or Robert Granjon, usually with the objective of proselytizing the Catholic faith.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/orient.html Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture/ Orient to Rome]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition to modern type: 17th and 18th century==
[[Baroque]] and [[rococo]] aesthetic trends, use of the pointed-pen for writing, and steel [[engraving]] techniques effected a gradual shift in typographic style. Contrast between thick and thin strokes increased. Tilted stressing transformed into vertical stressing; full rounds were compressed. Blunt bracketed serifs grew sharp and delicate until they were fine straight lines. Detail became clean and precise.

Transitional roman types combined the classical features of lettera antiqua with the vertical stressing and higher contrast between thick and thin strokes characteristic of the true modern romans to come.

The roman types used c. 1618 by the Dutch printing firm of [[House of Elzevir|Elzevir]] in [[Leyden]] reiterated the 16th-century French style with higher contrast, less rigor and a lighter page effect. After 1647 most Elzevir faces were cut by the highly regarded Christoffel van Dyck, whose precise renditions were regarded by some experts at the time as finer than Garamond's.

===Fell types===
[[File:Fell english roman thumb.png|thumb|200px|right|Specimen of '''Fell type''' English roman, quoting [[Cicero]]'s [[In_Catilinam#Oratio_in_Catilinam_Prima_in_Senatu_Habita|First Oration against Catiline]].]]

From mid-16th century until the end of the 17th, interference with printing by the British Crown thwarted the development of [[type foundry|type founding]] in England&amp;mdash;most type used by 17th-century English printers was of Dutch origin. The lack of material inspired Bishop of Oxford [[John Fell (clergyman)|Doctor John Fell]] to purchase punches &amp; matrices from Holland c. 1670&amp;ndash;1672 for use by the [[Oxford University Press]]. The so-named Fell types, presumed to be the work of Dutch [[punchcutting|punchcutter]] Dirck Voskens, mark a noticeable jump from previous designs, with considerably shorter extenders, higher stroke contrast, narrowing of round letters, and flattened serifs on the baseline and descenders. The design retained a retrogressive old-style irregularity, smooth modeling from vertical to horizontal, and angled stressing of rounds (except a vertically stressed '''o'''). Fell capitals were condensed, even-width, with wide flattened serifs; all characteristics of the definitive modern romans of the late 18th century. Fell italic types were distinguished by high contrast matching the Fell romans; wider ovals; a split-branching stroke from the stems of '''m n r''' and '''u'''; and long, flat serifs&amp;mdash;prefiguring modern. They repeated the non-uniform slant of French models, and the capitals included swash '''J''' and '''Q''' forms.

An open-source digitisation of the Fell Types has been released by designer and engineer Igino Marini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marini|first1=Igino|title=The Fell Types|url=http://iginomarini.com/fell/|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caslon===
[[File:Caslon english roman thumb.png|thumb|200px|right|'''[[Caslon|Caslon English roman]]''', from a sample issued by the Caslon foundry and quoting the same text. Compare against the Fell type.]]
The first major figure in English typography is reckoned by type historians to have ended the monopoly of Dutch type founding almost single-handedly. The gun engraver-turned-punchcutter [[William Caslon]] spent 14&amp;nbsp;years creating the [[Caslon|stable of typefaces on the specimen sheet issued in 1734]]. The complete canon included roman, italic, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic ''etc.'' Caslon's Great Primer roman and English roman were retrogressive designs that very closely followed the Fell types and the roman of Miklós (Nicholas) Kis c. 1685 falsely attributed to [[Anton Janson]]. Like the Fells, Caslon's slightly bracketed serifs and old-style irregularity gave it a homely charm&amp;mdash;its precise cut and perpendicularity place it firmly in the 18th century however. Caslon's italic structures follow the Fell italics, but at a condensed width and with conventional branching from stems.

William Caslon's prodigious output was influential worldwide. Caslon type and its imitations were used throughout the expanding [[British empire]]. It was the dominant type in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] for the second half of the 18th century. Caslon marks the rise of England as the center of typographic activity.

===Fleischmann===
[[Joan Michaël Fleischman]] (1701&amp;ndash;1768) was born in [[Nürnberg]] where he trained as a punchcutter. He found employment with Dutch type founders in Holland and settled there c. 1728. At the Enschedé foundry in [[Haarlem]] he cut punches for a large amount of material. Some time after 1743 he produced a distinguished roman design&amp;mdash;related to the preceding transitional types but departing from them. It prefigured modern romans with sparse transaxial modeling joining the vertical stressing to hairline thins, and ball-ends. Fleischmann borrowed from the general mode of Phillipe Grandjean’s and Louis Simonneau’s "[[Romain du Roi]]," commissioned by [[Louis XIV]] in 1692&lt;ref name="meggs58"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Meggs | first = Philip B. | authorlink = Philip B. Meggs | title = A History of Graphic Design | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | year = 1998 | location =  | edition = Third | pages = 108–109 | isbn = 978-0-471-29198-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the Imprimerie Royale, but did not imitate that face. Fleischmann's capitals were a new variety; an even-width scheme, compressed rounds, all-vertical stressing, and triangular beak ends of '''E F L T''' and '''Z''', all characteristics prefiguring the "classical" moderns of [[Bodoni]] and [[Didot (typeface)|Didot]]. Fleischmann's italic bore some resemblance to Granjean's but had longer ascenders and followed the established Dutch structures for '''h v''' and '''w'''.

Fleischmann was held in great esteem by his contemporaries, his designs exerting a decisive influence in the last quarter of the 18th century. Renowned French punchcutter [[Pierre Simon Fournier]] (1712–1768), confessed to having copied Fleischmann's design, and was first to dub "contrast" types like the Fells, Caslon and Fleischmann "modern". Fournier's rococo-influenced designs&amp;mdash;Fournier and Narcissus&amp;mdash;and his Modèles des Caractères (1742) continued the romaine du roi style and adapted it for his own modern age. Like Baskerville, his italics were inspired by handwriting and the engraved lettering known as [[copperplate_script | copperplate]] hand. Fournier also published a two volume ''Manuel Typographique'', in which he recorded much European typographic history, and introduced the first standardized system of type size measurement&amp;mdash;the "point".

===Baskerville===
[[File:basker specimen.jpg|right|thumb|200px|'''The [[Baskerville]] typeface''' designed by John Baskerville.]]
The roman and italic types of [[John Baskerville]] c. 1772 appeared later than Fleischman's but are considered transitional and partly retrogressive with a return to lower contrast, smooth transaxial modeling, finely modeled bracketed serifs, and long stems. The exquisite design and finish of Baskerville's roman however, combining elegance and strength, was modern. His roman design, and especially his italic, were rococo-influenced. His designs did not visibly quote any previous types. They were informed by his prior experience as a writing master and the influences of his time. The types of Joseph Fry, Alexander Wilson, and John Bell closely followed Baskerville, and through his correspondence with European type founders Baskerville's influence penetrated most of western Europe. Baskerville was a meticulous artist who controlled all aspects of his creation, devising more accurate presses, blacker inks and paper sealed with hot rollers to ensure crisp impressions. Of particular note, the lower storey of his lowercase g does not fully close. Derivatives of Baskerville are often identified thus. A modern revival of Baskerville, a font called [[Mrs Eaves]], is named after Baskerville's wife who was the widow of Richard Eaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Penney|first=Chris|title=Dr B T Davis's bequest|journal=Research Libraries Bulletin|issue=6|page=21|issn=1355-9877|url=http://www.special-coll.bham.ac.uk/rlb_autumn98.pdf|accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern romans===
[[File:Bodoni mt thumb ls.png|thumb|200px|right|'''[[Facsimile]] of sample''' published with genuine [[Bodoni]] types by the Officina Bodoni in 1925. The font shown is the digital Bodoni [[Monotype]] c. 1999.]][[File:AFDidotSpecimen.svg|right|thumb|200px|'''Didot type''' Revival designed in 1991 by Adrian Frutiger for [[Mergenthaler Linotype Company|Linotype foundry]].]]
True modern romans arrived with the types of the Italian [[Giambattista Bodoni]] and the French [[Didot family|Didot]]s. Completing trends begun by the Fell types, Fleischman, Fournier and Baskerville, the so-called "classical" modern romans eschewed [[chirography|chirographic]] and organic influences, their synthetic [[Symmetry|symmetric]] geometry answering to a rationalized and reformed classical model driven by the [[Cartesian coordinate system|strict cartesian grid]] philosophy of [[René Descartes]] and the predictable clockwork universe of [[Isaac Newton]].

The "classical" appellation of modern romans stems from their return to long ascenders and descenders set on widely spaced lines, and a corresponding light page effect reminiscent of old-style&amp;mdash;occurring at a time of classical revival.

Bodoni was foremost in progressing from rococo to the new classical style. He produced an italic very close to Baskerville's, and a French cursive script type falling in between italic type and joined scripts. The roman types of [[Didot family#François-Ambroise Didot|Francois Ambroise Didot]] and son [[Firmin Didot]] closely resemble the work of Bodoni, and opinion is divided over whether the Didots or Bodoni originated the first modern romans. At any rate the Didots' mathematical precision and vanishing of rococo design reflected the "enlightenment" of post-revolution France under [[Napoleon]]. Francois Ambroise also designed "maigre" and "gras" types corresponding to later condensed and expanded font formats.

The Spanish designer [[Joaquín Ibarra]]'s roman was influenced by Baskerville, Didot and Bodoni, but hewn nearer to old-style and used in the same classical manner, including spaced capitals. In England modern romans resembling Bodoni's were cut for the printer [[William Bulmer]] c. 1786 by the punchcutter William Martin, who had been apprenticed to Baskerville and influenced by him. Martin's italic mirrored the open-tail '''g''' and overall finesse of Baskerville's.

In Britain and the United States, modern romans (emerging around 1800 and totally dominant by the 1820s) took a somewhat more rounded, less geometrical form than the designs of Didot and Bodoni; an obvious difference is that in Anglo-American faces the upper-case C has only one serif (at the top) whereas in European designs it has two.

== 19th and 20th century typography ==
&lt;!-- E.g., Art deco and art nouveau fonts --&gt;

===Industrialization===
The 19th century brought fewer stylistic innovations. The most notable invention was the rise of typefaces with strengthened serifs. Forerunners were the so-called [[Slab serif|Egyptienne]] fonts, which were used already at the beginning of the 19th century. Their name likely comes from the enthusiasm of the Napoleonic era for the orient, which in turn was started by Napoleon's [[French Invasion of Egypt (1798)|invasion in Egypt]]. In fact slab-serif fonts (''e.&amp;thinsp;g.'' [[Clarendon (typeface)|Clarendon]] from 1845) were newspaper fonts, whose serifs were strengthened in order to prevent damage during the printing process. Stylistically the serif fonts of the mid-19th century appeared very robust and otherwise had more or less neo-classical design features, which changed during the course of time: By the application of the slab serif design feature and by appending serifs to more and more typefaces, an independent intermediate group of heterogeneous fonts emerged during the 20th century. Meanwhile, the slab serifs are listed as an independent group in most typeface classifications&amp;mdash;besides both main groups '''serif''' and '''sans serif'''.

Slab-serif and sanserif types were rarely used for continuous bodies of text; their realm was that of advertisements, title-pages and other attention-catching pieces of print. By about 1820, most western countries were using modern romans and italics for continuous texts. This remained true until the 1860s, when so-called 'old style' faces&amp;mdash;a largely English-speaking phenomenon&amp;mdash;came into use. These went to the opposite extreme from the modern faces; 'thick' strokes were attenuated, and serifs at the end of thin strokes (as in C, E, L and T) were narrow and angled whereas in modern faces they were broad and vertical or nearly so. All the upper-case characters were somewhat 'condensed' (narrowed). Old style faces remained popular until about 1910.

Above all the 19th century was innovative regarding technical aspects. Automatic manufacturing processes changed the print as well as the graphical illustrations. The illustration of printed matters could be considerably standardised due to the [[lithography]] technique invented by [[Alois Senefelder]]. Finally, another invention was [[photography]], whose establishment at the end of the 19th century led to the first [[halftone|halftoning]] and reproduction procedures. The step-by-step development of a modern mass society provided a growing demand of printed matters. Besides the traditional letterpress beginnings of a newspaper landscape as well as a broad market for publications, advertisements, and posters of all kinds appeared. The challenges had changed: since printing and typography had been a straightforward craft for centuries, it now had to face the challenges of an industry-ruled mass society.

===Hot type and phototypesetting in the 20th century===
[[File:Monotype-machine.jpg|thumb|left|[[Monotype Corporation|Monotype]] machine]]
[[File:exlibris-1921.png|thumb|left|[[Bookplate|Exlibris]], 1921]]
The 90 years between 1890 and 1980 coined typography until now. The craft of printing became an industry, and the typography became a part of it as well. Both stylistically and technologically this epoch was really tumultuous. The significant developments were the following:
*The fabrication and application of typefaces more and more were affected by industrial '''manufacturing processes'''. Significant incidents were the invention of the [[Hot metal typesetting|hot type]] machine by [[Ottmar Mergenthaler]] ([[Linotype machine]], 1886) and [[Tolbert Lanston]] ([[Monotype Corporation|Monotype machine]], 1887) and a few decades later the emergence of [[phototypesetting]]. The result: Compilation and typographical design of the text could be more and more controlled by keyboards in contrast to manual typesetting.
*A result of the industrialisation process was the unimagined '''number and distribution of new typefaces'''. Whether [[Digital data|digital]] variants of ''Garamond'' and ''Bodoni'' or new contemporary type designs like ''[[Futura (typeface)|Futura]]'', ''[[Times Roman|Times]]'', and ''[[Helvetica]]'', nearly all currently used typefaces have their origin either in the following and ongoing [[Typesetting#Digital era|digital typesetting era]] or are based on designs of this epoch. The basis was the appearance of large [[type foundry|type foundries]] and type manufacturers. The result: Successful typefaces could quickly gain the status of a trademark&amp;mdash;and therefore were able to assign a unique "[[brand]]ing" to products or publications.
*Besides the traditional typography of books '''[[graphic design]]''' became a more or less independent branch. The tensions between those two branches significantly determined the stylistic development of 20th century's typography.

===Art nouveau and New Book Art===
[[File:Typeface-eckmann.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eckmann (typeface)|Eckmann]], 1901.]]
Since [[impressionism]] the modern art styles were reflected in graphic design and typography too. Since 1890 the [[Art nouveau]] became popular. Its floral ornaments, the curved forms, as well as the emphasis on graphical realisation inspired the type designers of the start of the 20th century. A popular art nouveau font was the ''[[Eckmann (typeface)|Eckmann]]'' designed by graphic artist [[Otto Eckmann]]. Furthermore, the influence of art nouveau was expressed in a lot of book illustrations and [[Bookplate|exlibris]] designs.

Altogether the return to the roots of book art become stronger around the start of the 20th century. It was initiated by British typographer, socialist, and [[private press]] publisher [[William Morris]] as well as by the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], which refers to him. Essentially this movement initiated three things: a return to the antiqua-models of the Renaissance, clarity and simplicity of book illustrations, and straightforward technical processes during the production of printed matters. An immediate consequence of the Arts and Crafts Movement was the establishment of the private press movement, which more or less was committed to Morris' ideals, and whose remains partially are still present today. An established meeting point of this scene in Germany for example is the [[Mainzer Minipressen-Messe]], which actually is held every two years.

Especially the [[New Book Art]] movement, which formed in the decade before [[World War I]], was influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement. The young type designers of the pre-war era, among them [[Fritz Helmuth Ehmcke]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Kleukens]], rejected both the late typographical classicism and the ornaments of the popular Art nouveau. The new ideal became a tidy and straightforward book typography, which dedicated itself to the ideas of the Renaissance. [[Walter Tiemann]] in Leipzig, [[Friedrich Hermann Ernst Schneidler]] in Stuttgart, and [[Rudolf Koch]] in Offenbach as instructors were the mentors of this kind of typography. They stayed influential in the field of book typesetting until a long time after the end of [[World War II]].

[[File:Holystoning the deck on HMS Pandora.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sailors holystoning the deck of {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} in the early 20th century]]
'''Holystone''' is a soft and brittle [[sandstone]] that was formerly used in the [[Royal Navy]] and [[US Navy]] for scrubbing and whitening the wooden decks of ships.

A variety of origins have been proposed for the term, including that such stones were taken from broken monuments of St. Nicholas Church in Great Yarmouth&lt;ref&gt;Dean King, [[John B. Hattendorf]], and J. Worth Estes, ''A Sea of Words'', Holt &amp; Co., NY, 1997, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; or else the ruined church of [[St Helens, Isle of Wight|St. Helens]] adjacent to the St Helens Road anchorage of the Isle of Wight where ships would often provision. The US Navy has it the term may have come from the fact that 'holystoning the deck' was originally done on one's knees, as in prayer.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;US Navy Office of Information - [http://www.navy.mil/navydata/traditions/html/navyterm.html Origins of Navy Terminology page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,741773,00.html "Army &amp; Navy: No more holystone." ''Time''. June 8, 1931]&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller holystones were called "prayer books" and larger ones "Bibles". Holystoning eventually was not generally done on the knees but with a stick resting in a depression in the flat side of the stone and held under the arm and in the hands and moved back and forth with grain on each plank while standing or partially leaning over to put pressure on the stick-driven stone.  Holystoning continued on teak-decked [[Iowa class]] battleships into the 1990s.

Holystoning was a routine activity on Royal Navy vessels until the early 1800s. The practice reached its height in 1796 when [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Admiral St Vincent]] recommended to his captains that the decks of all ships in the fleet be holystoned "every evening as well as morning during the summer months."&lt;ref name=Lavery&gt;Lavery (ed.) 1998, pp. 419–420&lt;/ref&gt; For a [[ship of the line]], the practice could take up to four hours.

St Vincent's successor, [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Admiral Keith]], rescinded the order in 1801, finding that "the custom of washing the decks of ships of war in all climates in every temperature of the air, and on stated days let the weather be what it may" was so onerous as to be damaging the health and lives of the crews.&lt;ref name=Lavery/&gt; The practice was subsequently limited to once every seven to fourteen days, interspersed with sweeping.&lt;ref name=Lavery/&gt;

Holystoning the deck was part of Queen Victoria's regulations for British-owned Emigration vessels in 1848, "11. Duties of the sweepers to be to clean the ladders, hospitals, and round houses, to sweep the decks after every meal, and to dry-holystone and scrape them after breakfast."&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=DH4SAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=abstract+of+the+queen%E2%80%99s+order+in+council+for+preserving+order+and+securing+cleanliness+and+ventilation+on+board+of+british+ships+carry+ing+passengers+to+north+america.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8YcA0q_L_q&amp;sig=ghnaS_Nz4vayv64XB4e6xd1RpOM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPr9r11uHXAhUNY98KHauOB4kQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Holystoning continued as part of Navy routine throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but was ultimately regarded merely as a means to occupy an otherwise idle crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kennerley| first =Alston  | title =Aspirant Navigator: Training and  Education at Sea during Commercial Voyages in British Merchant Ships, c. 1850 to 1950| journal =The Great Circle | volume =30 | issue =2 | page=64 | publisher =Australian Association for Maritime History | date =2008 | jstor =41563271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its lack of utility was evidenced in contemporary accounts including an 1875 British Medical Journal advice which warned against having patients "set to useless tasks simply to keep them employed, such as sailors have to do in holystoning the decks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Treatment of Dipsomaniacs|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=741|publisher=British Medical Journal|date =13 March 1875|location =London|jstor=25240702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States Navy==
Holystoning was banned in the US Navy as it wore down the decks too rapidly and caused excessive expense,&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,741773,00.html archive article (fee) ]&lt;/ref&gt; but the practice may have disappeared slowly. A 1952 graduate of the Naval Academy recalls of his Youngster (sophomore) cruise to England in the summer of 1949 aboard the {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}:

{{quote|It was with a stick in the depression of what we were told was brick normally used as insulation in the boilers. A group of 30–40 would stand behind an estimated 4–5-inch board and would move the brick back and forth in coordination with the others while the person in charge would establish the cadence, and then command 'shift' when we would all back up one board and repeat the process. As I recall, sea water and sand were used to aid the effort. The result, once finished with a sea water rinse and a sun bleach, was a clean white deck, just in time for our arrival in Portsmouth, England.}}

Holystoning is referenced in [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]]'s diary, the 1840 classic ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'', in what he calls the "Philadelphia Catechism":&lt;ref&gt;Dana, Richard Henry, ''Two Years Before the Mast'' (1840), Chapter Three.

'''Jean Berko Gleason''' (born 1931) is a [[professor emerita]] in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences (formerly the Department of Psychology) at [[Boston University]],{{refn|{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/psych/faculty/gleason/|title=Jean Berko Gleason, PhD Professor Emerita|accessdate=28 January 2013}}
}}
a [[psycholinguistics|psycholinguist]] who has made fundamental contributions to the understanding of [[language acquisition]] in children, [[aphasia]], gender differences in language development, and parent–child interactions.{{r|beginning}}

Of her '''Wug Test''', by which she demonstrated that even young children possess implicit knowledge of [[Morphology (linguistics)|linguistic morphology]], it has been said, "Perhaps no innovation other than the invention of the tape recorder has had such an indelible effect on the field of child language research", the "wug" (one of the imaginary creatures Gleason drew in creating the Wug Test) being "so basic to what [psycholinguists] know and do that increasingly it appears in the popular literature without attribution to its origins."{{r|beginning}}

==Biography==

[[File:GleasonAndrewMattei WithJean1958.jpg|upright=1.2|right|thumb|With [[Andrew M. Gleason|Andrew Gleason]], 1958]]

Jean Berko was born to Hungarian immigrant parents in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].{{refn| name=Bonvillain|{{cite book|last=Bonvillain|first=N.|title=Language, culture, and communication: the meaning of messages.|date=1993|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780135226407}} }} After graduating from [[Cleveland Heights High School]] in 1949, Gleason earned a B.A. in history and literature from [[Radcliffe College]], then an M.A. in [[linguistics]], and a combined Ph.D. in linguistics and [[psychology]], at [[Harvard]];
from 1958 to 1959 she was a postdoctoral fellow at [[MIT]].{{refn| name=cv |{{citation |url=http://www.jeanberkogleason.com/documents/jeanberkogleasoncvweb.pdf |title=Jean Berko Gleason – Curriculum Vitae}} }} In graduate school she was advised by [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]], a founder in the field of [[language acquisition|child language acquisition]]. In January 1959 she married Harvard mathematician [[Andrew Gleason]]; they had three daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bolker |first=Ethan D. |title=Andrew M.

Most of Gleason's professional career has been at [[Boston University]], where she served as Psychology Department chair and director of the Graduate Program in Applied Linguistics; [[Lise Menn]] and [[Harold Goodglass]] were among her collaborators there.

She has been a visiting scholar at [[Harvard University]], [[Stanford University]], and at the Linguistics Institute of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].{{r|ceiling}}  Although officially retired and no longer teaching, she {{as of|2006|alt=continues}} to be involved in research.&lt;ref name=Skarabela&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skarabela|first1=Barbora|title=An interview with Jean Berko Gleason|journal=IASCL – Child Language Bulletin|date=July 2006|volume=26|issue=1|url=http://www.iascl.org/bulletins/bulletinV26N1.html|accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleason is the author or coauthor of some 125 papers on language development in children, language attrition, aphasia, and gender and cultural aspects of language acquisition and use;{{refn|{{cite web |url=http://jeanberkogleason.com/?page_id=19 |title=Jean Berko Gleason – Biographical Summary}} }}

==Selected research==

==={{anchor|wugtest}}Children's learning of English morphology{{mdashb}}the Wug Test===
&lt;!--Wug test redirects here please retarget redirect if this section is renamed --&gt;
[[File:WugTest NowThereIsAnotherOne FairUseOnly.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|One of Gleason's hand-drawn panels from the original Wug Test (1958)]]

Gleason devised the Wug Test as part of her earliest research (1958), which used nonsense words to gauge children's acquisition of morphological rules{{mdashb}}for example, the "default" rule that most [[English plurals]] are formed by adding an {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/z/}} or {{IPA|/ɨz/}} sounds, e.g., ''{{nobr|hat{{ndash}}hats,}} {{nobr|eye{{ndash}}eyes,}} {{nobr|witch{{ndash}}witches.}}''{{r|childs_learning}}
A child is shown simple pictures of an imaginary creature or activity,{{refn|&lt;!--&lt;&lt;BARE URL NEEDS FIXING--&gt;1=
[http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/topics/ Topics in Language Acquisition]
}}&lt;ref name=Balota&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Balota|editor-first1=David A.|editor-last2=Marsh|editor-first2=Elizabeth J.|title=Cognitive psychology: key readings|date=2004|publisher=Psychology press|location=Hove ; New York, N.Y.|isbn=1841690651|page=526|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0jjVEHoK20C&amp;pg=PA526}}&lt;/ref&gt;
with a nonsense name, and prompted to complete a statement about it:
:&lt;!--/:/ instead of /quote/ for consistency with bullet-list later--&gt;''This is a WUG. Now there is another one. There are two of them. There are two________.''{{r|childs_learning}}
A critical attribute of the test is that the "target" word be a made-up (but plausible-sounding) [[pseudoword]], so that the child will never have heard it before.
A child who knows that the plural of ''witch'' is ''witches'' may have heard and memorized that pair, but a child responding that the plural of ''wug'' (which the child presumably has never heard) is ''wugs'' (/wʌgz/, using the /z/ allomorph since "wug" ends in a voiced consonant) has apparently inferred (perhaps unconsciously) the basic rule for forming plurals.{{r|childs_learning}}{{efn-ua|
Very young children are baffled by the question, sometimes responding with ''two wug''. Preschoolers ages 4 to 5 test best in dealing with {{IPA|/z/}} after a voiced consonant, and generally say that there are two wugs, with a {{IPA|/z/}}; they do almost as well with the voiceless {{IPA|/s/}}. They do  less well in dealing with {{IPA|/z/}} in other environments such as after [[nasal consonants|nasals]], [[rhotics]], and vowels. Children in the first year of [[primary school]] were almost fully competent with both {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}.  Both preschool and first-grade children dealt poorly with {{IPA|/ɨz/}}, giving the correct answer less than half the time, possibly because it occurs in the most restrictive context. Also, because the root of the test word often ended in {{IPA|/s/}} in these cases, the children may have assumed that the word was already in its plural form. Even though the children were all able to produce the real plural "glasses" they generally responded two "tass" rather than two "tasses" when shown more than one nonsense creature called a "tass".{{r|childs_learning}}
}}

The Wug Test also includes questions involving verb conjugations, possessives, and other common derivational morphemes such as the [[agent noun|agentive]] ''-er'' (e.g. "A man who 'zibs' is a ________?"),
and requested explanations of common compound words e.g. "Why is a birthday called a birthday?"{{efn-ua
|{{r|childs_learning}} Preschoolers tend to form compounds rather than agentives e.g. a man whose job it is to "zib" is a ''zibman'', and often explain compound words in terms of their cultural, rather than linguistic, features e.g. a birthday is called ''birthday'' because one receives presents.}}
Other items included:
*''This is a dog with QUIRKS on him. He is all covered in QUIRKS. What kind of a dog is he? He is a ________ dog.''{{refn|name=onbeing|{{cite web

*''This is a man who knows how to SPOW. He is SPOWING. He did the same thing yesterday. What did he do yesterday? Yesterday he________.''{{r|onbeing}}
(The expected answers were ''QUIRKY'' and ''SPOWED''.){{r|childs_learning}}&lt;!--not sure "expected" is the right word here--&gt;

Gleason's major finding was that even very young children are able to connect suitable endings{{mdashb}}to produce plurals, past tenses, possessives, and other forms{{mdashb}}to nonsense words they have never heard before, implying that they have already internalized systematic aspects of the linguistic system which no one has necessarily tried to teach them.{{r|onbeing}}
However, she also identified an earlier stage at which children can produce such forms for real words, but not yet for nonsense words{{mdashb}}implying that children start by memorizing singular{{ndash}}plural pairs they hear spoken by others, then eventually extract rules and patterns from these examples which they apply to novel words.{{refn

}}

The Wug Test was the first experimental proof that young children have extracted generalizable rules from the language around them, rather than simply memorizing words that they have heard,{{refn
|name="pathways" |{{citation |last1=Karmiloff |first1=Kyra|first2= Annette|last2= Karmiloff-Smith|date=2001|title=Pathways to Language: From Fetus to Adolescent|publisher=  Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674008359}}}}{{r|beginning|page=2}} and it was almost immediately adapted for children speaking languages other than English, to bilingual children, and to children (and adults) with various impairments or from a variety of cultural backgrounds.{{r|beginning|page=3}} Its conclusions are viewed as essential to the understanding of when and how children reach major language milestones, and its variations and progeny remain in use worldwide for studies on language acquisition.{{r|beginning|page=8}} It is "almost universal" for textbooks in psycholinguistics and language acquisition to include assignments calling for the student to carry out a practical variation of the Wug Test paradigm.{{r|beginning|page=7}}

The Wug Test's fundamental role in the development of psycholinguistics as a discipline has been mapped by studying references to Gleason's work in "seminal journals" in the field, many of which carried articles referencing it in their founding issues:{{r|beginning|page=4}}
{{quote|A review of citation lists [for Gleason's paper] over the years gives an interesting mini-view of the evolution of developmental psycholinguistics... In the first 15 years following publication, the article was extensively cited by researchers attempting to validate its utility and extend its finding to nontypical populations. Over time, however... the fact that almost any human being can do that task... became much less interesting than the question of how it is accomplished.{{r|beginning|page=4}}}}

According to Ratner and Menn, "As an enduring concept in psycholinguistic research, the wug has become a generic, like [''kleenex''] or [''xerox''], a concept so basic to what we know and do that increasingly it appears in the popular literature without attribution to its origins... Perhaps no innovation other than the invention of the tape recorder has had such an indelible effect on the field of child language research."{{r|beginning|page=8}}

It has been proposed that Wug Test{{ndash}}like instruments be used in diagnosis of [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], but in practice success in this direction has been limited.{{r|beginning|page=4}}

===Parent–child interactions===

Another of Gleason's early papers "Fathers and Other Strangers: Men's Speech to Young Children" (1975) explored differences between mothers' and fathers' spoken interaction with their children, primarily using data produced by two female and two male daycare teachers at a large university, and by three mothers and three fathers, mostly during family dinners.
Among other conclusions, this study found that:
*mothers used less complex constructions in speaking to their children than did fathers;
*mothers generated lengthier and more complex constructions in speaking to their eldest child than to their younger children;
*fathers issued significantly more commands than did mothers, along with more threats and more teasing in the way of name{{hyp}}calling; and
*the fathers' language also reflected traditional gender roles in the families (such as in an example in which a father, playing a game with his son, directs the son to the mother when the need for a diaper change arises).&lt;ref name="Dato1975"&gt;Gleason, Jean Berko. (1975) "Fathers and other strangers: men's speech to young children". In Daniel P. Dato, ed., ''Developmental Psycholinguistics: Theory and Applications''. Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, both male and female daycare teachers used language that was similar both quantitatively and qualitatively, with both focusing on dialogue based in the present and on the immediate needs of the children.
Differences included that the male teachers tended to address the children by name more often than did the female teachers, and that the male teachers issued more [[imperative mood|imperative]]s than did the female teachers.{{refn |name=Gleason1975|{{cite journal |last=Gleason|first=Jean Berko |title=Fathers and Other Strangers: Men's speech to Young Children |journal=26th Annual Roundtable |date=1975 |pages=289–297}} }}

===Acquisition of routines in children===

Gleason's research eventually extended into the study of children's acquisition of routines{{mdashb}}that is, standardized chunks of language (or language-plus-gesture) that the culture expects of everyone, such as greetings, farewells, and expressions of thanks.  Gleason was one of the first to study the acquisition of politeness, examining English-speaking children's use of routines such as ''thank you'', ''please'', and ''I'm sorry''. Researchers in this area have since studied both verbal and non-verbal routinization, and the development of politeness routines in a variety of cultures and languages.&lt;ref name=Sheffield&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Matthews|editor-first1=Danielle |title=Pragmatic development in first language acquisition|date=2014|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-9027234704|page=324|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjTOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Halloween routine====

Gleason's 1976 paper with Weintraub, "The Acquisition of Routines in Child Language",
analyzed performance on the culturally standardized Halloween [[Trick-or-treat]] routine in 115 children aged two to sixteen years.
Alterations in ability and the function of parental contribution were analyzed concerning cognitive and social components.
They discovered that in the acquisition of routines
(in contrast to acquisition of much of the rest of language) parents' major interest is for their children to achieve accurate performance, with little stress on children's understanding of what they are expected to say.
Gleason and Weintraub found that the parents rarely if ever explain to children the meaning of such routines as ''Bye bye'' or ''Trick or treat''{{mdashb}}there was no concern with the child's thoughts or intentions as long as the routine was performed as expected at the appropriate times.
Thus, parents' role in the acquisition of routines is very different from their role in most of the rest of language development.{{refn

===="Hi, Thanks, and Goodbye"====
{{external media | float=right | width = 18em | align = right | headerimage=  | video1 = Jean Berko Gleason, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y7Vn9TEnM4 ''Hi,&amp;nbsp;Thanks, and Goodbye'']. NOVA's Secret Life of Scientists and Engineers}}&lt;!--review cite and presentation--&gt;

Gleason and Greif analyzed children's acquisition of three ubiquitous routines in "Hi, Thanks, and Goodbye: More Routine Information" (1980).
Subjects were eleven boys and eleven girls and their parents.
At the conclusion of a parent–child play period, an assistant entered the playroom bearing a present, in order to evoke routines from the children.
The study's purpose was to analyze how parents communicate these routines to their children; major questions proposed included whether or not some routines were more obligatory than others, and whether mothers and fathers provide different models of politeness behavior for their children. The results suggest that children's ''spontaneous'' construction of the three routines was low, with ''Thank you'' the rarest.
However, parents strongly encouraged their children to generate routines and, typically, the children complied.
In addition, parents were more likely to prompt the ''Thank you'' routine than the ''Hi'' and ''Goodbye'' routines.
Parents practiced the routines themselves, though mothers were more likely than fathers to speak ''Thank you'' and ''Goodbye'' to the assistant.{{refn

}} }}

====Apologies====

Gleason and Ely made an in-depth study of apologies in children's dialogue in their paper, "I'm sorry I said that: apologies in young children's discourse" (2006),{{refn
|name=Gleason2006|{{cite journal|last=Gleason|first=Jean Berko|author2=Ely|title=I'm sorry I said that: apologies in young children's discourse|journal=Journal of Child Language|date=2006|pages=33, 599–620}}
}}
which analyzed apology term usage (in parent–child dialogue) of five boys and four girls, aged one to six years.
Their research suggested that apologies appear later in children than do other politeness routines, and that as the children grew older they developed a progressively refined expertise with this routine, gradually requiring fewer direct prompts and producing more elaborate apologies instead of just saying "I'm sorry".
They also found that parents and other adults play an important role in fostering growth of apologetic abilities through the setting of examples, by encouraging the children to apologize, and by speaking specifically and purposefully to them about apologies.{{refn|name=Gleason2006}}

====Attention to language in family discourse====

With Ely, MacGibbon, and Zaretsky, Gleason also explored the discourse of middle-class parents and their children at the dinner table in, "Attention to Language: Lessons Learned at the Dinner Table" (2001),
finding that the everyday language of these parents involves a remarkable portion of attention to language.
The dinner-table conversation of twenty{{hyp}}two middle-class families, each with a child between two years and five and one{{hyp}}half years old, were recorded,
then analyzed for the existence and activity of language{{hyp}}centered terms, including words like ''ask'', ''tell'', ''say'', and ''speak''.
Mothers spoke more about language than did fathers, and fathers spoke more about it than did children:
roughly eleven percent of mothers' sentences contained one or more language{{hyp}}centered terms, and the corresponding proportions for fathers and children were seven percent and four percent.
Uses that were metalinguistic (for example, accounting for and remarking on speech) exceeded uses that were pragmatic (for example, managing how and when speech appears).{{r|Gleason2001}}

The more that mothers used language-centered terms, the more the children did as well{{mdashb}}but this was not true for fathers.
The results imply that in routine family conversations, parents supply children with considerable information on the way language is used to communicate information.{{refn

====Psychophysiological responses to taboo words====

An unusual study carried out with Harris and Aycicegi, "[[Taboo word]]s and reprimands elicit greater autonomic reactivity in a first language than in a second language" (2003), investigated the involuntary [[psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] reactions of bilingual speakers to taboo words.
Thirty{{hyp}}two Turkish{{hyp}}English bilinguals judged an array of words and phrases for "pleasantness" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (their first language), and in English (their second), while their [[skin conductance]] was monitored via fingertip electrodes.
Participants manifested greater [[arousal|autonomic arousal]] in response to taboo words and childhood reprimands in their first language than to those in their second language, confirming the commonplace claim that speakers of two languages are less uncomfortable speaking taboo words and phrases in their second language than in their native language.{{refn

====Maintenance of first and second languages====

In "Maintaining Foreign Language Skills", which discusses "the personal, cultural, and instructional factors involved with keeping up foreign language skills" (1988), Gleason and Pan consider both humans' remarkable capacity for language acquisition and their ability to lose it.
In addition to brain damage, strokes, trauma and other physical causes of language loss, individuals may lose language skills due to the absence of a linguistically supportive social environment in which to maintain such skills, such as when a speaker of a given language relocates to a place where that language is not spoken. Culture also factors in. More often than not, individuals speaking two or more languages come into contact with one another, for reasons ranging from emigration and interrelationships to alterations in political borders.

===Aphasia===

Gleason has also done significant research on [[aphasia]],
a condition (usually due to [[brain injury]]) in which a person's ability to understand and/or to produce language, including their ability to find the words they need and their use of basic morphology and syntax, is impaired in a variety of ways.&lt;ref name=Menn&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Menn|editor-first1=Lise|title=Agrammatic aphasia a cross-language narrative sourcebook|date=1990|publisher=J. Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9789027273512|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNFO3HAWIfMC&amp;pg=PA1932&amp;dq=Gleason}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenberg1982&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Sheldon|title=Handbook of applied psycholinguistics|date=1982|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale, N.J.|isbn=9780898591736|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b-PJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Some Linguistic Structures in the Speech of a Broca's Aphasic" (1972) Gleason, Goodglass, Bernholtz, and Hyde discuss an experiment carried out with a man who, after a [[stroke]], had been left with [[Expressive aphasia|Broca's aphasia]]/[[agrammatism]],
a specific form of aphasia typically impairing the production of morphology and syntax more than it impairs comprehension.
This experiment employed the [[Story Completion Test]] (often used to probe a subject's capacity for producing various common grammatical forms)
as well as free conversation and repetition to elicit speech from the subject;
this speech was then analyzed to evaluate how well he used inflectional morphology
(e.g. plural and past tense word endings) and basic syntax (the formation of, for example, simple [[declarative sentence|declarative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]], and [[interrogative]] sentences).{{r|Gleason1972}}

To do this the investigator, in a few sentences, began a simple story about a pictured situation, then asked the subject to conclude the narrative.
The stories were so designed that a non{{ndash}}language{{hyp}}impaired person's response would typically employ particular structures, for example the plural of a noun, the past tense of a verb, or a simple but complete yes{{hyp}}no question (e.g. "Did you take my shoes?").{{r|Gleason1972}}

Gleason, Goodglass, Bernholtz, and Hyde concluded that the transition from verb to object was easier for this subject than was the transition from subject to verb, and
that [[auxiliary verb]]s and verb [[inflection]]s were the parts of speech most likely to be omitted by the subject. There was considerable variation among consecutive repeat trials of the same test item, although responses on successive attempts usually came closer to those a normal speaker would have produced.
The study concluded that the subject's speech was not the product of a stable abnormal grammar, and could not be accounted for by assuming that he was simply omitting words to minimize his effort in producing them{{refn

The '''killing off''' of a character is a device in [[fiction]], whereby a character dies, but the story continues. The term, frequently applied to [[television]], [[film]] and chronological series, often denotes an untimely or unexpected death motivated by factors beyond the storyline.

In productions featuring actors, the unwillingness or inability of an actor to continue with the production for financial or other reasons (including illness, death, or producers' unwillingness to retain an actor) may lead to that character being "killed off" or removed from the storyline.

==Examples==
===Television===
Because of the episodic format of television shows, audience feedback and approval is often a factor in whether or not a character is killed off. [[Damon Lindelof]], executive producer of ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', has been quoted as saying that despite the widespread hate for [[Nikki and Paulo]], "We had a plan when we introduced them, and we didn't get to fully execute that plan. But when the plan is executed, [they] will be iconic characters on the show."&lt;ref name=ew&gt;Jensen, Jeff &amp; Snierson, Dan, (February 8, 2007) "[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20011203_3,00.html 'Lost' and Found]," ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. Retrieved on October 19th 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In an example of a character being killed off as a result of an actor leaving the show, [[Raymond Cruz]]'s character [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Tuco Salamanca|Tuco Salamanca]] on ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' was killed off because he found the part too difficult to play.&lt;ref&gt;Cruz, Raymond (March 17, 2009) "{{cite web |url=http://blogs.amctv.com/breaking-bad/2009/03/raymond-cruz-interview.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022195550/http://blogs.amctv.com/breaking-bad/2009/03/raymond-cruz-interview.php |archivedate=2012-10-22 |df= }}" ''[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]''. retrieved 19 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Characters may be killed off when the actors die. [[John Ritter]]'s character in ''[[8 Simple Rules]]'' was written to have died off screen after Ritter himself died during taping of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/05/arts/the-tv-watch-no-simple-rules-for-dealing-with-death.html|title=THE TV WATCH; No Simple Rules For Dealing With Death|last=Stanley|first=Alexandra|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 5, 2003|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian]] children's character [[Farfur]] (a [[Mickey Mouse]] [[lookalike]]) is an example of a character "killed off" for political reasons in 2007. After the program received criticism from some government ministers in both Palestine and [[Israel]] for espousing anti-Israeli sentiments, the Farfur character was killed off. Even his death, at the hands of an "Israeli agent", making Farfur a "martyr", was similarly politicised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6257594.stm BBC News: "Hamas 'Mickey Mouse' killed off] retrieved 5 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Priceline.com]] apparently killed off its lead character, the "Priceline Negotiator" (portrayed by longtime company spokesman [[William Shatner]]), in an [[Super Bowl advertising|advertisement]] during [[Super Bowl XLVI]].&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Lydia (January 29, 2012).

''The Daily Mail''. Retrieved January 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The killing off, however, turned out to be a hoax, as Shatner returned with his protégé (portrayed by [[Kaley Cuoco]]) in later commercials.

[[Brian Griffin]], the talking dog on ''[[Family Guy]]'', was killed off in the [[Family Guy (season 12)|Season 12 episode]], "[[Life of Brian (Family Guy)|Life of Brian]]" and was replaced with a new dog, Vinny, voiced by [[Tony Sirico]]. Fans of the show were devastated and started a petition in order to bring back Brian. However, Brian was brought back to life two episodes later, in the Christmas episode, "[[Christmas Guy]]", where [[Stewie Griffin]] travels back in time to prevent Brian from being struck by the car that killed him. Creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] said on [[Twitter]] shortly after the episode aired, "And thus endeth our warm, fuzzy, holiday lesson: Never take those you love for granted, or they can be gone in a flash. I mean, you didn't think we'd kill off Brian did you? Jesus we'd have to be fucking high."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/family-guy-brian-griffin-brought-back-to-life-as-seth-macfarlane-admits-hoax-9007251.html|title=Family Guy: Brian Griffin brought back to life as Seth MacFarlane admits hoax|last=Blundy|first=Rachel|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=December 16, 2013|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later revealed in the [[Family Guy (season 14)| season 14]] episode "[[Inside Family Guy]]" that he was killed off so that he could work on a remake of ''[[Old Yeller]]'', according to [[Lois Griffin|Lois]].

[[Maude Flanders]], a recurring character and the first wife of [[Ned Flanders]] on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', was killed off in the [[The Simpsons (season 11)|Season 11 episode]], ''[[Alone Again, Natura-Diddily]]'' where she is killed by a T-shirt cannon at the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] Speedway when [[Homer]] ducks at the last second to pick up a bobby pin on the ground. This kill off was decided by the show's producers after Maude's voice actress, [[Maggie Roswell]], left The Simpsons in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], which airs The Simpsons. [[Marcia Mitzman Gaven]] voiced Maude between 1999 and 2000 and many other of Roswell's characters during this period. Roswell returned to The Simpsons in 2002 after reaching a deal with producers to allow her to record her lines from her home in Denver. Since returning, she has voiced Maude in flashbacks and as a ghost.

When voice actor and Scientologist [[Isaac Hayes]] departed ''[[South Park]]'' over the show's creators criticism of [[Scientology]] in the episode [[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]], his character ([[Chef (South Park)|Chef]]) was killed off in the episode ''[[The Return of Chef]]''. For the episode, voice clips of Chef were taken from previous episodes and linked together to form new dialogue to support the plot.

===Comic books===
{{main|Comic book death}}
{{see also|Women in Refrigerators}}
Death is a frequently used dramatic device in comic book fiction, and in particular [[superhero fiction]]. Unlike stories in television or film, character deaths are rarely by unforeseen behind-the-scenes events, as there is no analogous situation to having actors portraying characters. Instead, characters are typically killed off as part of the story, or occasionally by editorial mandate to generate publicity for a title. Teasers may hint at characters' deaths for an extended period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8590902/Death-of-Spider-Man-the-latest-in-comic-book-trend-for-shocking-readers.html|title=Death of Spider-Man the latest in comic book trend for shocking readers|last=Allen|first=Nick|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of factors often mean that these changes are not permanent. Due to extremely long print runs, the popularity of these characters (with writers and fans) and occasionally rights issues for using the character in licensed adaptations, characters are often brought back to life by later writers. This can happen either as a depiction of their literal resurrection or by [[retcon]], a revision which changes earlier continuity and establishes the character not to have died in the first place. This phenomenon is known as the [[comic book death]]. Killing off a main character such as [[Superman]], [[Batman]] or [[Captain America]] can often lead to an uptick in publicity for a comic book, as well as high sales for the story in which they are inevitably brought back to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=45885|title=In Your Face Jam: Getting Over Death|last=White|first=Brett|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=June 5, 2013|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers have also criticized the trend for killing off supporting characters, particularly when female characters are killed off brutally to elicit a strong reaction in the male protagonist. This is known as the [[Women in Refrigerators]] trope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/comics/gail-simone-batgirl-movement-red-sonja-women/#/0|title=Gail Simone talks 'Batgirl,' 'The Movement,' 'fierce' women in comics|last=Hennon|first=Blake|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Specifically, the [[Death of Gwen Stacy]], long-time girlfriend of [[Spider-Man]], caused great shock and long-lasting controversy among fans.

'''Leonard Orban''' (born 28 June 1961) is a [[Romanians|Romanian]] independent [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]] who served as the [[European Commissioner for Multilingualism|Commissioner for Multilingualism]] in the [[Barroso commission|European Commission]], the executive body of the [[European Union]] (EU). He was responsible for the [[Languages of the European Union|EU language policy]] and was the first [[List of EU Commissioners by Nationality#Romanian Commissioners|Romanian Commissioner]] and the first [[European Commissioner|member of the Commission]] whose [[Portfolio (government)|portfolio]] is exclusively [[multilingualism]]. His term of office began on 1 January 2007 and ended on 9 February 2010. With a background in [[engineering]] and [[economics]], Orban has taken up various posts working for the [[accession of Romania to the European Union]], most prominently as Deputy and later as Chief Negotiator for his country at the time of final negotiations with the European Union.

Steering the multilingualism [[language policy]] of the EU, Orban focused on promoting [[language learning|foreign language learning]] through EU programmes such as the [[EU Integrated programme|Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]]. In addition, his remit also included the effective functioning of the EU's extensive [[Directorate-General for Interpretation (European Commission)|interpretation]], [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|translation]] and [[Publications Office (European Union)|publication services]] in the [[Languages of the European Union#Official languages of the European Union|23 official languages]]. To support the remit of his portfolio, Orban oversaw a staff of 3,400 in total (approximately 15 per cent of the Brussels executive's workforce) and approximately 1 per cent of the [[EU budget]].

Though unaffiliated to any political party, Orban adheres to [[liberalism]]. He supports Romania's closer [[European integration]] and a strong European Union, and were in favour of the relaunch of the frozen [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] without modifications to the original text.

As of 20 September 2011, he is the Romanian Minister of European Affairs, a new ministry in the [[Emil Boc]] Cabinet.

From 1993 to 2001, Orban served as a Parliamentary Counsellor on European and International Affairs within the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]] of the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]], where he was responsible for the European Integration Committee, as well as relations with the European Parliament. In 1995, the Association Agreement between the EU and Romania came into force and Orban also dealt with the Secretariat of the Joint Parliamentary Committee EU-Romania. Between May 2001 and December 2004, he served as Deputy Chief Negotiator and from December 2004 to December 2006, as Chief Negotiator with the EU and as Secretary of State of the [[Ministry of European Integration of Romania]], directly responsible for coordinating [[Accession of Romania to the European Union|Romania's preparation for accession to the EU]], as well as drafting the [[Treaty of Accession 2005|Treaty of Accession]].&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monitoruloficial.ro/monitoare/2006/mon1031.htm Decizii ale Primului-Ministru nr.222/27 decembrie 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129100301/http://www.monitoruloficial.ro/monitoare/2006/mon1031.htm |date=2007-01-29 }}, ''Monitorul Oficial al României no. 1031/27 decembrie 2006''.

==Portfolio as European Commissioner==
As [[European Commissioner for Multilingualism]] in the Barroso Commission, Orban was responsible for the [[languages of the European Union|language policy of the European Union]], i.e. promoting [[multilingualism]] for the citizens and the institutions of the [[European Union]]. He was the first to hold this [[Portfolio (government)|portfolio]]. Multilingualism has previously and subsequently been a responsibility of the [[European Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism]], [[Ján Figeľ]], the first Commissioner whose portfolio explicitly included multilingualism.

Politically, the portfolio is focused on promoting [[language learning|foreign languages learning]],&lt;ref name=Communication&gt;''[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0596:EN:NOT Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social committee and the Committee of the Regions – A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism]'' COM(2005) 596 final, November 22, 2005.

Though awareness for [[linguistic diversity]] is a policy target, the [[language rights]] of speakers of [[Regional language|regional]], [[Minority language|minority]], lesser-used and migrant languages are not legally protected. In the European Union, [[language policy]] is the responsibility of member states and European Union does not have a "common language policy." Based on the "principle of [[subsidiarity]]", European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field, promoting cooperation between the member states and promoting the European dimension in their language policies, particularly through the teaching and dissemination of their languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/12002E/htm/C_2002325EN.003301.html#anArt150 Consolidated version of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Articles 149 to 150], ''Official Journal C 321E of 29 December 2006''. Retrieved on February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The content of educational systems is the responsibility of individual member states and the European Union has very limited influence in this area. However, a number of European Union funded programmes actively promote [[language learning]], most prominently under the much wider [[EU Integrated programme|Lifelong learning Programme 2007–2013]]. Though regional and minority languages can benefit from European Union programmes, protection of linguistic rights is a matter for the member states.

Orban was also responsible for the effective functioning of the European Union's extensive [[Language interpretation|interpretation]], [[translation]] and [[publication]] services in the 23 official languages of the Union. Language policy affects the overall European Union strategy of communication with its citizens and the effort to establish a European identity.&lt;ref name="statement"&gt;Leonard Orban, [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/hearings/commission/2006_enlarg/speeches/speech_orban_en.pdf Introductory statement – European Parliament Hearing], (PDF) ''European Parliament website'', November 27, 2006. Retrieved on January 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In many of these issues, responsibility was shared with other Commissioners, namely the European Commissioner for Education, Training and Culture, Ján Figeľ. Orban was also responsible, alongside the [[President of the European Commission|President of the Commission]], [[José Manuel Barroso|Barroso]], and Figeľ to work on "intercultural dialogue", including the 2008 [[European Year of Intercultural Dialogue]].

Administratively, Orban was in charge of the [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General (DG) for Translation]], the [[Directorate-General for Interpretation (European Commission)|DG for Interpretation]] and the [[Publications Office (European Union)|Office for Official Publications of the European Communities]], as well as the Multilingualism policy unit (EAC-C-5) in the [[Directorate-General for Education and Culture (European Commission)|DG for Education and Culture]]. In total, Orban is responsible for overseeing 3,400 staff (approximately 15 per cent of the Brussels executive's workforce) and approximately 1 per cent of the [[EU budget]].&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt;

Orban was assisted by a cabinet of nine members; Patricia Bugnot (French) was Head of Cabinet and Jochen Richter (German) was Deputy Head. The cabinet did not include any natively [[English-speaking world|anglophone]] member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/archives/commission_2004-2009/orban/team/team_en.htm Leonard Orban – Official site – My Team], ''European Commission website'', undated.

According to Article 45 of the protocol to the Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and Romania, the new members of the Commission representing the acceding member states were appointed by the Council of the European Union in common accord with the President of the Commission and after consultation with the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2005/l_157/l_15720050621en00290045.pdf Treaty of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania], (PDF) ''Official Journal L 157 of 21 June 2005''.

On 30 October 2006, in agreement with the President of the Commission, Barroso, the Romanian government nominated Leonard Orban as Commissioner designate for Romania. Barroso assigned him the portfolio of multilingualism. Before Orban, [[Varujan Vosganian]], a former Romanian [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] [[Ministry of Economy and Commerce of Romania|Minister of Economy and Commerce]], had been nominated, but withdrew his candidature due to allegations concerning his past involvement with the secret police under [[Nicolae Ceauşescu|Ceauşescu]] and party financing by a tycoon. National Liberal Party foreign minister [[Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu]] refused a nomination.&lt;ref name="nomination"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/romania-proposes-new-commissioner-candidate/article-159271 Romania proposes new commissioner candidate], ''EurActiv.com'', October 30, 2006. Retrieved on January 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The assignment of the multilingualism portfolio to the Romanian Commissioner by Barroso was highly controversial. Barroso was severely criticized for creating a new Commissioner portfolio so that the accessing countries in 2007 could hold a post. The portfolio was criticized for being too "light" for such a high-rank official, that there would be an overlap of responsibilities with other Commissioners and the good functioning of the Commission would be endangered. The portfolio was considered insubstantial for a Commissioner due to the limited jurisdiction of the EU in affecting language policy and the more administrative (rather than political character) of the post. In addition, it appeared that the portfolio had been created to complete a 27-strong Commission; Romania's appointment of a technocrat rather than a politician, given the country's deficits in interior and justice policies, especially in terms of corruption, would result in the Romanian Commissioner taking a degraded portfolio. This criticism came from the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), Romania's main opposition party,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=world_news&amp;month=november2006&amp;file=world_news2006110224558.xml Romanian oppn wants better EU portfolio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090437/http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=world_news&amp;month=november2006&amp;file=world_news2006110224558.xml |date=2007-09-29 }}, ''The Peninsula'' (Reuters), November 2, 2006.

In his hearing at the European Parliament, Leonard Orban focused on defending the importance of his post in presenting the EU language policy, emphasising [[language learning|foreign language learning]] and describing the concrete initiatives he intended to implement.&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="summary of hearing"&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-329-331-11-48-901-20061127IPR00312-27-11-2006-2006-false/default_en.htm Summary of hearing of Leonard Orban, Commissioner-designate for Multilingualism], ''European Parliament Press Release'', November 27, 2006.

Retrieved on February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orban said that he intended to spearhead the Commission's work on a portfolio that has become more important with every [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]] and assured the [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] that his portfolio was a substantial one, covering a range of important political and managerial responsibilities. He also described how his portforlio would contribute to economic [[competitiveness]], the social dimension of the EU and the intercultural dialogue and stated that it would provide a forum for European political dialogue.&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt;

Orban told the Committee that the multilingual dimension of the EU must be made mainstream in all relevant EU policies and programmes and should not be seen as a separate, isolated policy. He stated that, "Politically, I will steer the Commission's work on bringing an active multilingualism policy into a variety of policies which are the key to the functioning of the EU and the [[internal market]]: [[Cultural policies of the European Union|culture]], [[Education in the European Union|education]] and competitiveness."&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt; In addition, he claimed that multilingualism would be commercially advantageous as, "At first sight, one single language might appear easier to manage [... but] multilingualism can also give any industry a competitive advantage if it helps them to tap local markets and create new products which also cater for multilingualism."&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt; According to Orban, multilingualism promotes [[labour mobility]], [[Toleration|tolerance]] and a sense of [[European citizenship]] and, as an integral aspect of the legitimacy, transparency and democracy of the European integration, it contributes to a successful EU communication policy.&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt; Within the [[Lisbon Strategy|Lisbon strategy]], the target for foreign language learning is “mother tongue plus two,” which means that English language skills on their own are not sufficient.&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt; To address this, Orban aims to improve [[language teaching]] and to make the media and new [[Information technology|communication technologies]] more language-friendly. He underlined that, "our efforts to support multilingualism are not limited to EU languages; we are also encouraging training in Chinese, Japanese, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and Russian."&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt; He added that, "The promotion of language learning and [[linguistic diversity]] is a general objective of the new [[EU Integrated programme|programme for lifelong learning launched in 2007]]. For the first time, it will be open to all languages spoken in the European Union as well as to the languages of the EU's main trading partners."&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt; Orban claims that respect for linguistic diversity and the fight against [[discrimination]] on the basis of language are cornerstones for a social Europe; he states that, "Europe's linguistic and [[cultural diversity]] is a source of richness which also needs to be nurtured and promoted," which presumably includes all languages, [[national language|national]], [[regional language|regional]], [[minority language|minority]] and [[migrant language|migrant]].&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt; However, Orban agreed that the protection of [[language rights]] was a matter for individual member states and his view is that, "When it comes to language rights, I am not in favour of adopting legislation at European level to be imposed on Member States."&lt;ref name="summary of hearing"/&gt;

Orban's remit included the development of the European Indicator of Language Competence, the creation of a Business Forum on Multilingualism and ''Juvenes Translatores'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/translatores/ ec.europa.eu/translatores – Juvenes Translatores contest] (latin: young translators)&lt;/ref&gt; a [[translation]] contest between schools from all over Europe as part of the events marking the 50th anniversary of the [[Treaty of Rome]].&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt; In addition to the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 and other educational and cultural programmes, Orban promoted multilingualism within other relevant policies and programmes, including the [[Seventh Framework Programme|Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development]], the [[European Social Fund]] and [[immigration]] initiatives.&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt; He also intended to contribute to the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, where multilingualism played a fundamental part.&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt; On planning further policy, Orban promised to, "carefully analyse the results from the Action Plan for the promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity, the recommendations from the High Level Group on Multilingualism and the activities of the Commission internal network for multilingualism. Before the end of 2007, I would organise a [[Council of the European Union|Ministerial conference]] to discuss the way forward. I would then propose a new Action Plan in 2008 to continue work in this area."&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt;

His views on multilingualism fall in line with the current European Union language policy as described in the Communication from the Commission "A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism" on 22 November 2005.&lt;ref name="Communication"/&gt;

==Views on EU-Romania relations and the European integration==
Orban defended Romania's accession to the EU, believing that Romania can only gain from its entry&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2253068,00.html Romanian to Become EU's First Commissioner for Multilingualism], ''Deutsche Welle'', November 11, 2006. Retrieved on January 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and stressing the importance of a post-accession strategy for his country.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Orban: [http://english.hotnews.ro/Leonard-Orban-Stop-fighting-start-building-post-accession-strategies-articol_43991.htm "Stop fighting, start building post-accession strategies"], ''HotNews.ro'', December 15, 2006. Retrieved on February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the "future of Europe", Orban believes in a strong, cohesive European Union capable of being a major actor on the global scene. In addition, he stressed the need to increase the pace of the implementation of the [[Lisbon Strategy]], a ten-year strategy designed to make the European Union the world's most competitive economy by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/hearings/commission/2006_enlarg/questionnaires/general_reply_orban_en.pdf European Parliament Hearings – Answers to questionnaire for Commissioner designate Mr Leonard Orban (Multilingualism): part A – General questions], (PDF) ''European Parliament website'', October 20, 2006. Retrieved on February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutionally, he supported the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]], voted down in referendums in France and Netherlands in 2005, believing that it should be ratified by the member states without further negotiations or without excluding some of its provisions.&lt;ref name="summary of hearing"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27976">In [[philosophy]] and [[logic]], the classical '''liar [[paradox]]''' or '''liar's paradox''' or '''antinomy of the liar''' is the statement of a liar that he or she is lying: for instance, declaring that "I am lying". If the liar is indeed lying, then the liar is telling the truth, which means the liar is lying. In "this sentence is a lie" the paradox is strengthened in order to make it amenable to more rigorous logical analysis. It is still generally called the "liar paradox" although abstraction is made precisely from the liar himself. Trying to assign to this statement, the strengthened liar, a classical binary [[truth value]] leads to a [[contradiction]].

If "this sentence is false" is true, then the sentence is false, but if the sentence states that it is false, and it is false, then it must be true, and so on.

==History==
The [[Epimenides paradox]] (circa 600 BC) has been suggested as an example of the liar paradox, but they are not logically equivalent.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The semi-mythical [[Divination|seer]] [[Epimenides]], a [[Crete|Cretan]], reportedly stated that "All Cretans are liars."&lt;ref name="PaulTarsus"&gt;Epimenides paradox has "All Cretans are liars." {{bibleverse|Titus|1:12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Epimenides' statement that all Cretans are liars can be resolved as false, given that he knows of at least one other Cretan who does not lie. It is precisely in order to avoid uncertainties deriving from the human factor and from fuzzy concepts that modern logicians proposed a "strengthened" liar such as the sentence "this sentence is false".{{cn|date=November 2018}} 

The paradox's name translates as ''pseudómenos lógos'' (ψευδόμενος λόγος) in [[Ancient Greek]]. One version of the liar paradox is attributed to the [[history of Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Eubulides of Miletus]] who lived in the 4th century BC. Eubulides reportedly asked, "A man says that he is lying. Is what he says true or false?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://philosophy.about.com/od/Philosophical-Questions-Puzzle/a/Paradoxes-Of-Eubulides.htm |title=Paradoxes of Eubulides |publisher=About.com (New York Times)  |author=Andrea Borghini |accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paradox was once discussed by [[Jerome|St. Jerome]] in a sermon:
{{quote |"'[[Psalm 116|I said in my alarm, Every man is a liar!]]' Is [[David]] telling the truth or is he lying? If it is true that every man is a liar, and David's statement, "Every man is a liar" is true, then David also is lying; he, too, is a man. But if he, too, is lying, his statement: "Every man is a liar," consequently is not true. Whatever way you turn the proposition, the conclusion is a contradiction. Since David himself is a man, it follows that he also is lying; but if he is lying because every man is a liar, his lying is of a different sort."&lt;ref&gt;St. Jerome, Homily on Psalm 115 (116B), translated by Sr. Marie Liguori Ewald, IHM, in The Homilies of Saint Jerome, Volume I (1-59 On the Psalms), The Fathers of the Church 48 (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press, 1964), 294&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Indian grammarian-philosopher [[Bhartrhari]] (late fifth century AD) was well aware of a liar paradox which he formulated as "everything I am saying is false" (sarvam mithyā bravīmi). He analyzes this paradox together with the paradox of "unsignifiability" and explores the boundary between statements that are unproblematic in daily life and paradoxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jan E.M. Houben |title=Bhartrhari's solution to the Liar and some other paradoxes |journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy |volume=23 |issue=4 |year=1995 |pages=381-401 |jstor=23447805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JEMH2001&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jan E.M.

In early [[Islamic]] tradition liar paradox [[Liar paradox in early Islamic tradition|was discussed for at least five centuries]] starting from late 9th century apparently without being influenced by any other tradition. [[Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī]] could have been the first logician to identify the liar paradox as [[List of paradoxes#Self-reference|self-referential]].&lt;ref name="Page 1 "&gt;{{cite web|title=The Early Arabic Liar:The Liar Paradox in the Islamic World from the Mid-Ninth to the Mid-Thirteenth Centuries CE |publisher= |url=http://files.davidsanson.com/research/ArabicLiar.pdf |page=1 |author=Ahmed Alwishah and David Sanson |year=2009 |ISBN= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816043742/http://files.davidsanson.com/research/ArabicLiar.pdf |archivedate=August 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation and variants==
The problem of the liar paradox is that it seems to show that common beliefs about [[truth]] and [[falsity]] actually lead to a [[contradiction]]. Sentences can be constructed that cannot consistently be assigned a truth value even though they are completely in accord with [[grammar]] and [[semantic]] rules.

The simplest version of the paradox is the sentence:

{{quote |A: This statement (A) is false.}}

If (A) is true, then "This statement is false" is true. Therefore, (A) must be false. The hypothesis that (A) is true leads to the conclusion that (A) is false, a contradiction.

If (A) is false, then "This statement is false" is false. Therefore, (A) must be true. The hypothesis that (A) is false leads to the conclusion that (A) is true, another contradiction. Either way, (A) is both true and false, which is a paradox.

However, that the liar sentence can be shown to be true if it is false and false if it is true has led some to conclude that it is "neither true nor false".&lt;ref name="Andrew Irvine 1992"&gt;Andrew Irvine, "Gaps, Gluts, and Paradox," ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'', supplementary vol. 18 [''Return of the A priori''] (1992), 273-99&lt;/ref&gt; This response to the paradox is, in effect, the rejection of the claim that every statement has to be either true or false, also known as the [[principle of bivalence]], a concept related to the [[law of the excluded middle]].

The proposal that the statement is neither true nor false has given rise to the following, strengthened version of the paradox:

{{quote |This statement is not true. (B)}}

If (B) is neither '''true''' nor false, then it must be not '''true'''. Since this is what (B) itself states, it means that (B) must be '''true'''. Since initially (B) was not '''true''' and is now true, another paradox arises.

Another reaction to the paradox of (A) is to posit, as [[Graham Priest]] has, that the statement is both true and false. Nevertheless, even Priest's analysis is susceptible to the following version of the liar:

{{quote |This statement is only false. (C)}}

If (C) is both '''true''' and false, then (C) is only false. But then, it is not '''true'''. Since initially (C) was '''true''' and is now not '''true''', it is a paradox. However, it has been argued that by adopting a [[Bivalent logic|two-valued]] relational semantics (as opposed to [[Truth function|functional semantics]]), the dialetheic approach can overcome this version of the Liar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is an Inconsistent Truth Table?|publisher=The Australasian Journal of Philosophy |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00048402.2015.1093010?journalCode=rajp20#.V2s2nvkrL4Y |page=7 |author=Zach Weber, Guillermo Badia and Patrick Girard |year=2015 |ISBN= |deadurl= |archiveurl=https://www.academia.edu/10273875/What_is_an_inconsistent_truth_table |archivedate=June 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also multi-sentence versions of the liar paradox. The following is the two-sentence version:

{{quote |The following statement is true. (D1)}}
{{quote |The preceding statement is false. (D2)}}

Assume (D1) is true. Then (D2) is true. This would mean that (D1) is false. Therefore, (D1) is both true and false.

Assume (D1) is false. Then (D2) is false. This would mean that (D1) is true. Thus (D1) is both true and false. Either way, (D1) is both true and false - the same paradox as (A) above.

The multi-sentence version of the liar paradox generalizes to any circular sequence of such statements (wherein the last statement asserts the truth/falsity of the first statement), provided there are an odd number of statements asserting the falsity of their successor; the following is a three-sentence version, with each statement asserting the falsity of its successor:

{{quote |E2 is false. (E1)}}
{{quote |E3 is false. (E2)}}
{{quote |E1 is false. (E3)}}

Assume (E1) is true. Then (E2) is false, which means (E3) is true, and hence (E1) is false, leading to a contradiction.

Assume (E1) is false. Then (E2) is true, which means (E3) is false, and hence (E1) is true. Either way, (E1) is both true and false - the same paradox as with (A) and (D1).

There are many other variants, and many complements, possible. In normal sentence construction, the simplest version of the complement is the sentence:

{{quote |This statement is true. (F)}}

If F is assumed to bear a truth value, then it presents the problem of determining the object of that value. But, a simpler version is possible, by assuming that the single word 'true' bears a truth value. The analogue to the paradox is to assume that the single word 'false' likewise bears a truth value, namely that it is false. This reveals that the paradox can be reduced to the mental act of assuming that the very idea of fallacy bears a truth value, namely that the very idea of fallacy is false: an act of misrepresentation. So, the symmetrical version of the paradox would be:

{{quote |The following statement is false. (G1)}}
{{quote |The preceding statement is false. (G2)}}

==Possible resolutions==

===Alfred Tarski===
[[Alfred Tarski]] diagnosed the paradox as arising only in languages that are "semantically closed", by which he meant a language in which it is possible for one sentence to predicate truth (or falsehood) of another sentence in the same language (or even of itself). To avoid self-contradiction, it is necessary when discussing truth values to envision levels of languages, each of which can predicate truth (or falsehood) only of languages at a lower level. So, when one sentence refers to the truth-value of another, it is semantically higher. The sentence referred to is part of the "object language", while the referring sentence is considered to be a part of a "meta-language" with respect to the object language. It is legitimate for sentences in "languages" higher on the semantic hierarchy to refer to sentences lower in the "language" hierarchy, but not the other way around. This prevents a system from becoming self-referential.

However, this system is incomplete. One would like to be able to make statements such as "For every statement in level ''α'' of the hierarchy, there is a statement at level ''α''+1 which asserts that the first statement is false." This is a true, meaningful statement about the hierarchy that Tarski defines, but it refers to statements at every level of the hierarchy, so it must be above every level of the hierarchy, and is therefore not possible within the hierarchy (although bounded versions of the sentence are possible).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Arthur Prior===
[[Arthur Prior]] asserts that there is nothing paradoxical about the liar paradox. His claim (which he attributes to [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[John Buridan]]) is that every statement includes an implicit assertion of its own truth. Thus, for example, the statement "It is true that two plus two equals four" contains no more information than the statement "two plus two equals four", because the phrase "it is true that..." is always implicitly there. And in the self-referential spirit of the Liar Paradox, the phrase "it is true that..." is equivalent to "this whole statement is true and ...".

Thus the following two statements are equivalent:

{{quote |This statement is false.}}
{{quote |This statement is true and this statement is false.}}

The latter is a simple contradiction of the form "A and not A", and hence is false. There is therefore no paradox because the claim that this two-conjunct Liar is false does not lead to a contradiction. Eugene Mills&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Eugene (1998) ‘A simple solution to the Liar’, Philosophical Studies 89: 197-212.&lt;/ref&gt; and Neil Lefebvre and Melissa Schelein&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, N. and Schelein, M., "The Liar Lied," in [[Philosophy Now]] issue 51&lt;/ref&gt; present similar answers.

===Saul Kripke===
[[Saul Kripke]] argued that whether a sentence is paradoxical or not can depend upon contingent facts.&lt;ref name="Kripke1975"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Saul |last=Kripke |author-link=Saul Kripke |year=1975 |title=An Outline of a Theory of Truth |journal=Journal of Philosophy |volume=72 |issue=19 |pages=690–716 |doi=10.2307/2024634}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barwise1989"/&gt;{{rp|6}} If the only thing Smith says about Jones is

{{quote |A majority of what Jones says about me is false.}}

and Jones says only these three things about Smith:

{{quote |Smith is a big spender.}}
{{quote |Smith is soft on crime.}}
{{quote |Everything Smith says about me is true.}}

If Smith really is a big spender but is ''not'' soft on crime, then both Smith's remark about Jones and Jones's last remark about Smith are paradoxical.

Kripke proposes a solution in the following manner. If a statement's truth value is ultimately tied up in some evaluable fact about the world, that statement is "grounded". If not, that statement is "ungrounded". Ungrounded statements do not have a truth value. Liar statements and liar-like statements are ungrounded, and therefore have no truth value.

===Jon Barwise and John Etchemendy===
[[Jon Barwise]] and [[John Etchemendy]] propose that the liar sentence (which they interpret as synonymous with the Strengthened Liar) is ambiguous. They base this conclusion on a distinction they make between a "denial" and a "negation". If the liar means, "It is not the case that this statement is true", then it is denying itself. If it means, "This statement is not true", then it is negating itself. They go on to argue, based on [[situation semantics]], that the "denial liar" can be true without contradiction while the "negation liar" can be false without contradiction. Their 1987 book makes heavy use of [[non-well-founded set theory]].&lt;ref name="Barwise1989"/&gt;

===Dialetheism===
[[Graham Priest]] and other logicians, including J.C. Beall, and Bradley Armour-Garb have proposed that the liar sentence should be considered to be both true and false, a point of view known as [[dialetheism]]. Dialetheism is the view that there are true contradictions. Dialetheism raises its own problems. Chief among these is that since dialetheism recognizes the liar paradox, an intrinsic contradiction, as being true, it must discard the long-recognized [[principle of explosion]], which asserts that any proposition can be deduced from a contradiction, unless the dialetheist is willing to accept trivialism - the view that ''all'' propositions are true. Since trivialism is an intuitively false view, dialetheists nearly always reject the explosion principle.  Logics that reject it are called ''[[paraconsistent logic|paraconsistent]]''.

===Non-cognitivism===
[[Andrew David Irvine|Andrew Irvine]] has argued in favour of a non-cognitivist solution to the paradox, suggesting that some apparently well-formed sentences will turn out to be neither true nor false and that "formal criteria alone will inevitably prove insufficient" for resolving the paradox.&lt;ref name="Andrew Irvine 1992"/&gt;

===Bhartrhari's perspectivism===
The Indian grammarian-philosopher [[Bhartrhari]] (late fifth century AD) dealt with paradoxes such as the liar in a section of one of the chapters of his magnum opus the Vākyapadīya. Although chronologically he precedes all modern treatments of the problem of the liar paradox, it has only very recently become possible to confront his views and analyses with those of modern logicians and philosophers because sufficiently reliable editions and translations of his work have only started becoming available since the second half of the 20th century. Bhartrhari's solution fits into his general approach to language, thought and reality, which has been characterized by some as "relativistic", "non-committal" or "perspectivistic".&lt;ref&gt;Jan E.M. Houben, "Bhartrhari's Perspectivism (1)" in Beyond Orientalism ed. by Eli Franco and Karin Preisendanz, Amsterdam - Atlanta: Rodopi, 1997; [[Madeleine Biardeau]] recognized that Bhartrhari "wants to rise at once above all controversies by showing the conditions of possibility of any system of interpretation, rather than to prove the truth of a certain particular system" (Théorie de la connaissance et philosophie de la parole dans le brahmanisme classique, Paris - La Haye: Mouton, 1964, p. 263)&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the liar paradox (''sarvam mithyā bravīmi'' "everything I am saying is false") Bhartrhari identifies a hidden parameter which can change unproblematic situations in daily communication into a stubborn paradox. Bhartrhari's solution can be understood in terms of the solution proposed in 1992 by Julian Roberts: "Paradoxes consume themselves. But we can keep apart the warring sides of the contradiction by the simple expedient of temporal contextualisation: what is 'true' with respect to one point in time need not be so in another ... The overall force of the 'Austinian' argument is not merely that 'things change', but that rationality is essentially temporal in that we need time in order to reconcile and manage what would otherwise be mutually destructive states."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Julian. 1992.

New Haven and London: Yale University Press. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert's suggestion, it is the factor "time" which allows us to reconcile the separated "parts of the world" that play a crucial role in the solution of Barwise and Etchemendy.&lt;ref name="Barwise1989"/&gt;{{rp|188}} The capacity of time to prevent a direct confrontation of the two "parts of the world" is here external to the "liar". In the light of Bhartrhari's analysis, however, the extension in time which separates two perspectives on the world or two "parts of the world" — the part before and the part after the function accomplishes its task — is inherent in any "function": also the function to signify which underlies each statement, including the "liar".&lt;ref name=JEMH2001/&gt; The unsolvable paradox — a situation in which we have either contradiction (''virodha'') or infinite regress (''anavasthā'') — arises, in case of the liar and other paradoxes such as the unsignifiability paradox ('''[[Bhartrhari's paradox]]'''), when abstraction is made from this function (''vyāpāra'') and its extension in time, by accepting a simultaneous, opposite function (''apara vyāpāra'') undoing the previous one.

==Logical structure==
For a better understanding of the liar paradox, it is useful to write it down in a more formal way. If "this statement is false" is denoted by A and its truth value is being sought, it is necessary to find a condition that restricts the choice of possible truth values of A. Because A is [[Self-reference|self-referential]] it is possible to give the condition by an equation.

If some statement, B, is assumed to be false, one writes, "B = false". The statement (C) that the statement B is false would be written as "C = "B = false"". Now, the liar paradox can be expressed as the statement A, that A is false:

"A = "A = false""

This is an equation from which the truth value of A = "this statement is false" could hopefully be obtained. In the [[boolean domain]] "A = false" is equivalent to "not A" and therefore the equation is not solvable. This is the motivation for reinterpretation of A. The simplest logical approach to make the equation solvable is the dialetheistic approach, in which case the solution is A being both "true" and "false". Other resolutions mostly include some modifications of the equation; [[Arthur Prior]] claims that the equation should be "A = 'A = false and A = true'" and therefore A is false. In computational verb logic, the liar paradox is extended to statements like, "I hear what he says; he says what I don't hear", where verb logic must be used to resolve the paradox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Yang | first = T.|title = Computational verb systems: The paradox of the liar | journal = International Journal of Intelligent Systems | volume = 16 | issue = 9 | pages = 1053–1067 | publisher = | date = Sep 2001 | doi=10.1002/int.1049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Gödel's first incompleteness theorem===

[[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] are two fundamental theorems of [[mathematical logic]] which state inherent limitations of sufficiently powerful axiomatic systems for mathematics. The theorems were proven by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1931, and are important in the philosophy of mathematics. Roughly speaking, in proving the [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|first incompleteness theorem]], Gödel used a modified version of the liar paradox, replacing "this sentence is false"  with "this sentence is not provable", called the "Gödel sentence G". His proof showed that for any theory "T", "G" is true, but not provable in "T". The analysis of the truth and provability of "G" is a formalized version of the analysis of the truth of the liar sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Crossley | first1=J.N. | last2=Ash | first2=C.J. | last3=Brickhill | first3=C.J. | last4=Stillwell | first4=J.C. | last5=Williams | first5=N.H. | title=What is mathematical logic? | zbl=0251.02001 | location=London-Oxford-New York | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=1972 | isbn=0-19-888087-1 | pages=52–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prove the first incompleteness theorem, Gödel represented [[Gödel numbering|statements by numbers]]. Then the theory at hand, which is assumed to prove certain facts about numbers, also proves facts about its own statements. Questions about the provability of statements are represented as questions about the properties of numbers, which would be decidable by the theory if it were complete. In these terms, the Gödel sentence states that no natural number exists with a certain, strange property. A number with this property would encode a proof of the inconsistency of the theory. If there were such a number then the theory would be inconsistent, contrary to the consistency hypothesis. So, under the assumption that the theory is consistent, there is no such number.

It is not possible to replace "not provable" with "false" in a Gödel sentence because the predicate "Q is the Gödel number of a false formula" cannot be represented as a formula of arithmetic. This result, known as [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]], was discovered independently by Gödel (when he was working on the proof of the incompleteness theorem) and by [[Alfred Tarski]].

[[George Boolos]] has since sketched an alternative proof of the first incompleteness theorem that uses [[Berry's paradox]] rather than the liar paradox to construct a true but unprovable formula.

==In popular culture==

The liar paradox is occasionally used in fiction to shut down artificial intelligences, who are presented as being unable to process the sentence. In ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode "[[I, Mudd]]", the liar paradox is used by [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] and [[Harry Mudd]] to confuse and ultimately disable an android holding them captive. In the 1973 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[The Green Death]]'', the Doctor temporarily stumps the insane computer BOSS by asking it "If I were to tell you that the next thing I say would be true, but the last thing I said was a lie, would you believe me?" However BOSS eventually decides the question is irrelevant and summons security.

In the 2011 videogame ''[[Portal 2]]'', [[GLaDOS]] attempts to use the "this sentence is false" paradox to defeat the naïve artificial intelligence [[Wheatley (Portal)|Wheatley]], but, lacking the intelligence to realize the statement a paradox, he simply responds, "Um, true. I'll go with true. There, that was easy." and is unaffected.

In the seventh episode of ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'' titled "Access Denied" the main character Jesse and his friends are captured by a supercomputer named PAMA. After PAMA controls two of Jesse's friends, Jesse learns that PAMA stalls when processing and uses a paradox to confuse him and escape with his last friend. One of the paradoxes the player can make him say is the liar paradox.

In [[Douglas Adams]] [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|The hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]], chapter 21 he describes a solitary old man inhabiting a small asteroid in the spatial coordinates where it should have been a whole planet dedicated to Biro ([[ballpoint pen]]) life forms. This old man repeatedly claimed that nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy |last=Adams |first=Douglas |isbn=0517542099 |edition=1st American |location=New York |oclc=6251440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of the '''highest-grossing films which are not primarily in [[English language|English]]'''.

==Film and language==
English-language films are vastly over-represented among [[List of highest-grossing films|films that are among the most commercially successful in history]]. Among the top 100 highest-grossing films, 99 of them are entirely in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/|title=All Time Worldwide Box Office Grosses|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary source of highest-grossing films is, and has long been{{cn&lt;!-- Italian cinema was greater than American b4 WWI? Don't just say that, give me a source so that we can tell the readers! --&gt;|date=January 2018}}, the [[Major film studio#Majors|major film studios]] of the [[Cinema of the United States|United States]], and nearly all of these films are English-language films since the [[United States]] is [[Languages of the United States|primarily an English-speaking nation]].

The relative success of English-language films can also be explained by considering that the [[English language]] is [[English as a lingua franca|widely considered]] to be a [[Lingua franca|universal language]]—it is the [[first language]] of 400 million people, the [[second language]] of another 400 million, and a [[foreign language]] of an additional 700 million; English is thus understood by 1,500 million people{{sfn|Crystal|2006|pp=424–426}}, which is almost 20% of [[World population|all the people in the world]]. The [[Chinese language]], especially [[Mandarin Chinese|the standard variant]], have over twice as many native speakers as English, but a lot fewer foreign-language speakers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/size|title=Summary by language size|website=Ethnologue|accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus making it a less globalized and potentially less commercially profitable language outside of China.

==List of highest-grossing non-English films==
{| class="wikitable sortable" style="margin:auto;"
|+ Films that have grossed USD 100 million or more internationally&lt;!-- this cutoff was indeed arbitrarily invented by me, simply because it made the list conveniently sized. As the list grows, we should change it to a fixed number such as "top 50" --&gt; and are not primarily in the English language&lt;!-- "primarily" means that English is either a non-spoken language; a minority-spoken language; or a co-main language AND the film was made in a non-English-speaking nation --&gt;

'''Melech Epstein''' (1889–1979) was an American journalist and historian. His two most famous books, ''Jewish labor in U.S.A.'' and ''The Jew and communism'' are considered standard works.

== Early life ==

Epstein was born in [[Ruzhany]], [[Grodno]] Guberniya, [[Imperial Russia]] (now in Belarus). His family was unsure of his exact birth date, but assigned him March 15, 1889, the second day of [[Purim]].&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Melech ''Pages from a colorful life'' Bloch Publishing Company 1971 pp.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  During his teenage years he became active in the Jewish [[Jewish Territorialist Organization|territorialist]] movement. Beginning shortly before the [[1905 revolution]] he was a [[Professional revolutionaries|cadre]] in the [[Zionist Socialist Workers Party]] in [[Białystok]], [[Łódź]], [[Warsaw]], [[Kiev]] and [[Odessa]]. His activities included writing for party journals, organizing unions and Jewish cultural societies and, in Białystok manning an armed guard of the Jewish neighborhood during a [[Białystok pogrom|pogrom]]. He served three intermittent periods in the Czarist prisons. Becoming dissatisfied with the ultimate aims of the territorialists he emigrated to America in 1913. He arrived at [[Ellis island]] on December 24, 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein ''Pages'' op. cit. pp.13-48&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York, Epstein settled in [[Brownsville, Brooklyn]] and became involved in the local Jewish radical scene. In 1915 became labor reporter for a new Yiddish daily ''The Day''. Soon he became labor editor, which was an ideal place to observe the burgeoning Jewish labor and radical movements.&lt;ref name=epstein&gt;Epstein ''Pages'' op. cit. pp.49, 60-63&lt;/ref&gt;  After ''The Day'' came out in favor of foreign intervention against the Bolsheviks Epstein left the paper and joined the staff of ''Zeit'', a [[Labor Zionist]] paper edited by [[David Pinsky]]. While working for ''Zeit'' he exposed financial improprieties involving [[Lucy Lang]], the ''Forward'' and the [[United Hebrew Trades]]. As a result, the UHT forced his expulsion from its affiliate, the [[Yiddish Writers Union]], which Epstein had helped to found in 1917.&lt;ref name=epstein/&gt; Despairing of mainstream union bureaucracy, he left the Socialist party in 1921, as part of the [[Workers Council of the United States]]. When this group merged with the communists to form the [[Workers Party of America]] Epstein was offered a place as labor editor on the communists' new Yiddish daily, ''[[Morgen Freiheit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein ''Pages'' op. cit. pp.68-70&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Communist Party ==

After a factional skirmish Epstein was made acting editor in 1923 and official editor in 1925. As editor he tried to steer the ''Freiheit'' into a more broad left direction and resisted pressures to make its content dogmatically communist. A member of the [[Jay Lovestone|Lovestone]] faction within the party he resigned the editorship in spring 1929 during intense factional warfare within the party.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein ''Pages'' op. cit. pp.71-72&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1929 both Epstein and [[Moissaye Joseph Olgin]], the new ''Freiheit'' editor were censured by the party for taking a pro-[[Yishuv]] stand in reporting on the out break of violence in Palestine. Under party  pressure the paper changed its analysis reporting the revolt as a national liberation movement against the British and their Zionist collaborators. That fall Epstein was relieved of all other party offices and was sent to the Soviet Union to "improve his communist morale".&lt;ref&gt;Epstein ''Pages'' op. cit. p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned in 1931. No longer on the staff of ''Freiheit'', he became educational director of the [[TUUL]] Needle Trades Workers Industrial Union and editor of its weekly ''Needle Worker''.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein ''Pages'' op. cit. p.102&lt;/ref&gt; He was allowed to return to the ''Freiheit'' during the transition to the popular front period in the mid-1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein ''Pages'' op. cit. p.104&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 he was sent to Palestine, officially as a ''Freiheit'' correspondent, but actually as an emissary to the [[Palestine Communist Party]]. The out break of yet another revolt strained relations between the CPUSA and American Jewry. The Comintern was silent on what stance to take, so they decided to send a personal envoy to the sister party to co-ordinate strategy. Epstein learned that the party was being rapidly "Arabized" and was taking a more and militant stand against the [[Zionists]] and the Yishuv in general.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein ''Pages'' op. cit. p.107-117&lt;/ref&gt; While in Palestine Epstein learned of the out break of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Without waiting for word from the party or ''Freiheit'' he sailed to [[Barcelona]] and became one of the first American journalists on the scene. He stayed in Spain for three months sending dispatches back to ''Freiheit''from the front lines.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein ''Pages'' op. cit. p.118-128&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-communist years ==

Melech Epstein broke with the party in August, 1939 after the [[Nazi-Soviet pact]]. This was the final event which sealed his disillusionment with the party, though he had been having misgivings for a decade since the beginning of the [[Third Period]] and then the show trials in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein ''Pages'' op. cit. p.135-137&lt;/ref&gt;  He went off to Mexico where he visited [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Diego Riviera]].&lt;ref&gt;Epstein ''Pages'' op. cit. p.140-143&lt;/ref&gt; When he came back to America he briefly joined the staff of ''[[The Forward]]'', but was fired soon after because he wouldn't go before the [[Dies committee]] or write sensationalistic material about the Communist Party. In 1943 he was hired by the [[Jewish Labor Committee]] to go on fund raising tours for the underground Jewish resistance movement in Poland. Finally, in 1945 he became public relations director of the Cloakmakers Joint Board of [[ILGWU]].&lt;ref&gt;Epstein ''Pages'' op. cit. p.148-150&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1947 he settled in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein ''Pages'' op. cit. p.151&lt;/ref&gt; There he wrote his two major books ''Jewish labor in U.S.A.'' and ''The Jew and communism'', independently published through a "Trade Union Sponsoring Committee" which was partly funded by ILGWU.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein ''Pages'' op. cit. p.165&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Hartnett''' ({{lang-ga|Mícheál Ó hAirtnéide}}) (18 September 1941 – 13 October 1999) was an [[Irish poetry|Irish poet]] who wrote in both English and Irish. He was one of the most significant voices in late 20th-century Irish writing and has been called "[[Munster]]'s de facto poet laureate".&lt;ref name="Nolan"&gt;{{cite news | last = Nolan | first = Val | title = The Shoulders for a Raggy Coat | publisher = Poetry Ireland Newsletter|date=July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and background==
Hartnett was born in [[Croom, County Limerick|Croom]] Hospital, [[County Clare]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartnett liked to cite his birth in Croom hospital, as Croom was an area connected with the ancient Gaelic poets&lt;/ref&gt; Although his parents' name was Harnett, he was registered in error as Hartnett on his birth certificate. In later life he declined to change this as his legal name was closer to the Irish Ó hAirtnéide. He grew up in the Maiden Street area of [[Newcastle West]], Co. Limerick, spending much of his time with his grandmother Bridget Halpin, who resided in the townland of Camas, in the countryside nearby. Hartnett claimed that his grandmother, was one of the last native speakers to live in Co. Limerick, though she was originally from North [[County Kerry|Kerry]]. He claims that, although she spoke to him mainly in English, he would listen to her conversing with her friends in Irish, and as such, he was quite unaware of the imbalances between English and Irish, since he experienced the free interchange of both languages. When he began school, he claims that he was made aware of the tensions between both languages, and was surprised to discover that Irish was considered an endangered language, taught as a contrived, rule-laden code, with little of the literary attraction which it held for him. He was educated in the local national and secondary schools in Newcastle West. Hartnett emigrated to England the day after he finished his secondary education and went to work as a tea boy on a building site in London.

==Early writings==
Hartnett had started writing by this time and his work came to the attention of the poet [[John Jordan (poet)|John Jordan]], who was professor of English at [[University College Dublin]].  Jordan invited Hartnett to attend the university for a year. While back in Dublin, he co-edited the literary magazine ''[[Arena]]'' with [[James Liddy]]. He also worked as curator of [[James Joyce|Joyce's]] tower at [[Sandycove]] for a time. He returned briefly to London, where he met Rosemary Grantley on 16 May 1965, and they were married on 4 April 1966. His first book, ''Anatomy of a Cliché'', was published by [[Poetry Ireland]] in 1968 to critical acclaim and he returned to live permanently in Dublin that same year.

He worked as a night telephonist at the telephone exchange on Exchequer Street. He now entered a productive relationship with [[New Writers Press]], run by [[Michael Smith (poet)|Michael Smith]] and [[Trevor Joyce]]. They published his next three books. The first of these was a translation from the Irish,  ''The Old Hag of Beare'' (1969), followed by ''Selected Poems'' (1970) and  ''Tao'' (1972). This last book was a version of the Chinese ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''. His ''Gypsy Ballads'' (1973), a translation of the ''Romancero Gitano'' of [[Federico García Lorca]]  was published by the [[Goldsmith Press]].

==A Farewell to English==
In 1974 Hartnett decided to leave Dublin to return to his rural roots, as well as deepen his relationship with the Irish language. He went to live in [[Templeglantine]], five miles from Newcastle West, and worked for a time as a lecturer in creative writing at [[Thomond College of Education, Limerick]].
[[File:MichaelHartnett.jpg|thumb]]
In his 1975 book ''A Farewell to English'' he declared his intention to write only in Irish in the future, describing English as 'the perfect language to sell pigs in'. A number of volumes in Irish followed: ''Adharca Broic'' (1978), ''An Phurgóid'' (1983) and ''Do Nuala: Foighne Chrainn'' (1984).
A biography on this period of Michael Hartnett's life entitled 'A Rebel Act Michael Hartnett's Farewell To English' by Pat Walsh was published in 2012 by Mercier Press.

==Later life and works==
In 1984 he returned to Dublin to live in the suburb of [[Inchicore]]. The following year marked his return to English with the publication of ''Inchicore Haiku'', a book that deals with the turbulent events in his personal life over the previous few years. This was followed by a number of books in English including ''A Necklace of Wrens'' (1987), ''Poems to Younger Women'' (1989) and ''The Killing of Dreams'' (1992).

He also continued working in Irish, and produced a sequence of important volumes of translation of classic works into English.

'''Mir Tanha Yousufi''', born '''Muhammad Saleh''' on 1 January 1955 in the village Adam Ke Cheema, tehsil [[Daska]], district [[Sialkot]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] Pakistan, is one of well-known and popular contemporary [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Urdu]] writers.

He is best known for his Punjabi literature. He has so far produced two short story collection and five novels in Punjabi. Most of his work has been transliterated in Gurumukhi script in Indian Punjab.
Beside his Punjabi works, he is a well known Urdu and Punjabi poet.

==Literary life==
Mir Tanha Yousufi started his literary voyage as an Urdu poet. Since 1972, when he was an undergraduate science student, he kept sending his ghazals and poems to various literary magazines and literary pages of national news papers.

===Work in Urdu===
From 1986 onwards he continued contributing poems, ghazals and short stories to Urdu magazines including:
“Fanoon (Lahore)” edited by late Ahmed Nadeem Qasimi,
“Takhleeq (Lahore)” edited by Azhar Javed,
"Moaasir (Lahore)” edited by Ata-ul-Haq Qasimi,
“Adabiyat (Pakistan Academy of Letters' quarterly magazine) and
“Kitab (Literary magazine of Pakistan Book Foundation).

====Urdu poetry====
His first Urdu poetry collection “Luknat(Fumbling)" was published in 1996. It contains modern as well as traditionally styled ghazals with a handful of poems (free versed as well as metered). The book was received with a critical acclaim and appreciation from the contemporary men of letters.

Second collection of Urdu poetry is ready to go to the press. The contents of this book would be styled similar to the "Luknat". A good portion of this next Urdu poetry collection has already been contributed to various magazines.

====Urdu prose====
Although Yousufi has a good number of Urdu short stories; both in post modern and plain traditional style, yet the matter is not sufficient to be presented in the form of a book. He does believe in quantity, yet he feel that quality is of prime importance which is a must for any creative piece of work.
A few of his Urdu Afsanas have been published in magazines.

==Punjabi work==
Punjabi being his mother tongue; it was but natural to keep moving between Urdu poetry to Punjabi poetry. This drove him to write Punjabi prose as well, which he did with consistency and ended up with the publication of his first book in Punjabi. Some of these magazines are listed as:
“Sver International” edited by Jamil Paul,
“Rvel” and “Meeti” edited by Ilyas Ghumman,
“Lehraan” edited by Akhter Hussain Akhter and
"Pancham" edited by Saqib Maqsood.

===Punjabi prose===
Yousufi's first Punjabi short story collection “Sooraj Uggan Taa’en [Till the Sun Rises]" was published in 1996. This book proved to be his introduction in Punjabi literary world.

And here entered Ilyas Ghumman in his life. Ilyas Ghumman, an electrical engineer by profession, is a Lahore-based renowned Punjabi writer, worker and publisher. He has a world fame for organising events regarding the development and progress of Punjabi language, literature and culture. He asked Yousufi to try his pen for writing down some novelette/novel. This suggestion of Ghumman drove Mir Tanha Yousufi to produce his first Punjabi novel

====Treh====
“Treh {Thirst}" in 1998. Fluently written, clear in thoughts, rushing story lines and the purity of the language made this book a surprise for the Punjabi readers.

====Ik Samadar Paar====
Seeing the response on "Treh", Mir Tanha Yousufi was asked for more. Thus his second novel "Ik Samandar Paar [Across One Sea]", published in 2000, won the prestigious Punjabi literary award from "Masood Khaddar Posh Trust".

“Masood Khaddar Posh Trust's Award" is regarded as the most respectable of all awards in Punjabi. It is well known in Pakistani Punjabi writers' community what "Masood Khaddar Posh Trust's Award" actually means. Some writers spent their life span to win it just for once!

====Khiddoo====
Taking further courage, he penned down his next novel "Khiddoo [The Cotton Ball]"; which won the award from "Masood Khaddar Posh Trust" for the second time, in the year 2002.

===Kaalaa Chaanan===
During all these years of writing "Treh", "Ik Samandar Paar" and "Khiddoo", along with his continuous activities in other Urdu and Punjabi writings (both poetry and prose), he had been thinking to write down something real big, a saga in Punjabi language. A deep research work, knowledge of the history and geography of the backdrop locale of the novel, the study of the civilisation, culture and anthropology of area was needed. And thus, was written his Pakistan's "National Literary Award, 2005" or "Syed Waris Shah Award, 2005" winner Punjabi novel "Kaalaa Chaanan [Black Light]"; which spans over 728 pages and is the thickest novel in Punjabi published in Pakistan till 2005.
When "Masood Khaddar Posh Trust's Award" for 2005 was made public; "Kaalaa Chaanan" was declared a winner and by this achievement Mir Tanha Yousufi became a writer who had won "Masood Khaddar Posh Trust's Award" three times in a row—a hat trick—a unique honour for any Pakistani Punjabi writer.

====Tae Faer====
To cater the demand of Punjabi loving people, the short stories written after "Sooraj Uggan Taen" were collected. These stories had been published in various Punjabi magazines and kept making waves all these years due to style, language and intellect. The book was named "Tae Faer [Then What?]"and was published in 2005.

This book picked up "Pakistan Writers' Guild Punjab's Best Prose Book in Punjabi printed in 2005.
The same book was judged for "Razia Farrukh Kahani Award, 2005" and was announced the Best Short Stories' Book of the year.

=====2005, a milestone=====
2005 remains a milestone and memorable year for Mir Tanha Yousufi's writing career with 4 awards on two books.

====Annha Khooh====
His latest novel "Annha Khooh [Abandoned Well]" was published in 2008 and this novel too, got "Masood Khaddar Posh Trust's Award".
This makes Mir Tanha Yousufi a unique writer with 4 consecutive Masood Khaddar Posh Trust Awards.

===Punjabi poetry===

'''Musine Kokalari''' (February 10, 1917 [[Adana]], [[Turkey]] – August 14, 1983) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] prose writer and politician in Albania's pre-communist period. She was the founder of the [[Social Democratic Party of Albania|Social-Democratic Party of Albania]] in 1943.&lt;ref name="Ikub Info"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ikubinfo.com/ikubLAJME/NewsDetails.aspx?id=4b3f95f7-c984-41e8-a916-5cf8aabfa222| trans-title= Musine Kokalari: My Italian Love|title=Musine Kokalari: Dashuria ime italiane| publisher=Ikubinfo.com|language=sq}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kokalari was the first female writer of Albania.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Katharina |title=An Encyclopedia of continental women writers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Wf1SVbGFg8C&amp;pg=PA646&amp;dq=musine+kokalari&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=musine%20kokalari&amp;f=false|volume=2|isbn=0-8240-8547-7 |pages=646 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a short involvement in politics during [[World War II]], she was persecuted by the communist regime in Albania, and not allowed to write anymore. She died in poverty and complete isolation.

==Early life==
Musine Kokalari was born on February 10, 1917 in [[Adana]] in southern [[Turkey]] of a patriotic and politically active family of Gjirokastrian origin. She returned to Albania with her family in 1920. Musine was early to acquire a taste for books and learning since her brother Vesim operated a bookstore in [[Tirana]] in the mid 1930s. In January 1938, she left for Rome to study literature at the university there and graduated in 1941 with a thesis on [[Naim Frashëri]]. Her stay in the eternal city gave her an ephemeral glimpse into a fascinating world of intellectual creativity and her sole aim in life upon her return to Albania was to become a writer.

In 1943, she declared to a friend, "I want to write, to write, only to write literature, and to have nothing to do with politics."

==Publications==
She had, at the age of twenty-four, indeed already published an initial 80-page collection of ten youthful prose tales in her native Gjirokastrian dialect: ''As my old mother tells me'' ({{lang-sq|Siç me thotë nënua plakë}}), Tirana, 1941. This historic collection, strongly inspired by [[Tosk]] [[folklore]] and by the day-by-day struggles of women of Gjirokastër, is thought to be the first work of literature ever written and published by a woman in Albania. Their value consists of the very lively dialect of Gjirokastër and the prevailing mores of the region.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; Kokalari called the book, "the mirror of a world gone by, the path of transition from girlhood with its melodies and the first years of marriage to the world of the grown woman, once again bound by the heavy chains of slavery to patriarchal fanaticism."

Three years later, despite the vicissitudes of [[World War II]], Kokalari now twenty-seven, was able to publish a longer collection of short stories and sketches entitled ''How life swayed'' ({{lang-sq|Sa u-tunt jeta}}), Tirana, 1944, a total of 348-pages which established her—ever so briefly—as a writer of substance. A third volume of her folksy tales was entitled ''Around the Hearth'' ({{lang-sq|Rreth vatrës}}), Tirana, 1944.

==After World War II==
[[File:Musine Kokalari during the process.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Photo taken during her trial in 1946]]
As [[World War II]] came to an end, Kokalari herself opened a bookstore and was invited to become a member of the [[Albanian League of Writers and Artists]], created on October 7, 1945 under the chairmanship of [[Sejfulla Malëshova]]. All the time she was haunted by the execution without trial of her two brothers, Mumtaz and Vejsim, on November 12, 1944 by the communists and candidly demanded justice and retribution. Having herself been closely associated in 1944 with the fledgling Albanian Social-Democratic party and its press organ ''[[Zëri i lirisë]]'' ("The voice of freedom"), she was arrested on January 17, 1946 in an age of terror concomitant with the arrest of Malëshova, and on July 2, 1946 was sentenced to twenty years in prison by the military court of Tirana as a ''saboteur and enemy of the people.''&lt;ref name="International Pen"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.internationalpen.org.uk/go/freedom-of-expression/campaigns/because-writers-speak-their-minds-50-years-of-defending-freedom-of-expression/1960-musine-kokalari | title=1960: Musine Kokalari | publisher=International Pen | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328140859/http://www.internationalpen.org.uk/go/freedom-of-expression/campaigns/because-writers-speak-their-minds-50-years-of-defending-freedom-of-expression/1960-musine-kokalari | archivedate=March 28, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Right before her arrest Kokalari had sent a letter to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]], which were still based in the Albanian capital, Tirana. In her letter she called for free elections and freedom of expression. At the trial, Kokalari stated the following:&lt;ref name="International Pen"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I don't need to be a communist to love my country. I love my country even though I am not a communist. I love its progress. You boast that you have won the war, and now you are the winner you want to extinguish those who you call political opponents. I think differently from you but I love my country. You are punishing me for my ideals!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1964, after 18 years in the [[Prison of Burrel]] in the [[District of Mat]] region, isolated and under constant surveillance, she spent the following next 19 years of her life in [[internment]] in the town of [[Rrëshen]], Northern Albania, where she had to work as a streetsweeper.&lt;ref name="Moisiu"&gt;{{cite news | last=Moisiu | first=Rajmonda | url=http://www.fjalaelire.com/index.php/arkiva/6168.html | title=Appreciation for Musine Kokalari and Imprisoned Writers in the World! | publisher=Fjala e Lire | date= July 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was never allowed to resume her writing.&lt;ref name="International Pen"/&gt;

==Recognition==
Kokalari was one of the first 30 imprisoned writers to be listed in 1960 by the Committee of the Three (precursor of [[International PEN]]).&lt;ref name="International Pen"/&gt; In 1993 Kokalari was posthumously declared a ''Martyr of Democracy'' by the [[President of Albania]] and a school in Tirana now bears her name.&lt;ref name="International Pen"/&gt;

'''Narayan Pandit''' ([[Hindi]]: नारायण पण्डित), or '''Narayana''', was the [[Brahmin]] author of the ''[[Sanskrit]]'' treatise called ''[[Hitopadesha]]'' — a  work based primarily on the ''[[Panchatantra]]'', one of the oldest collection of stories, mainly animal fables, in the world. Narayana's dates are not known, but scholarly consensus places the composition of the ''Hitopadesha'' at around 800 to 950 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Haksar 1998, p x.&lt;/ref&gt; The last lines of the book indicate the name of the author as Narayan Pandit:

नारायणेन प्रचरतु रचितः संग्रहोsयं कथानाम्

Narayan Pandit was the royal poet of Dhawalchandra, the king of [[Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tdil.mit.gov.in/CoilNet/IGNCA/hitop.htm Information about Narayan Pandit] (in Hindi)&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning and ending [[shloka]]s of the book indicate the deep faith of Narayan Pandit in lord [[Shiva]].

'''Narayana Kasturi''' (25 December 1897 – 14 August 1987)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vahini.org/Discourses/d3-kasturispoem.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sais"/&gt; ({{lang-kn|ನಾರಾಯಣ ಕಸ್ತೂರಿ}}; {{lang-ta|நாராயண கஸ்தூரி}}; {{lang-ml|നാരായണ കസ്തൂരി}}; {{lang-te|నారాయణ కస్తూరి}}) was born Kasturi Ranganatha Sharma&lt;ref name="sais"&gt;http://media.radiosai.org/Journals/Vol_06/01JAN08/03-coverstory.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in North [[Travancore]],&lt;ref name="author"&gt;http://www.vahini.org/sss/i/theauthorwrites.html&lt;/ref&gt; which now forms part of the modern day Indian state of [[Kerala]]. He is remembered by many as a great visionary who promoted human fraternity and [[multilingualism]].

He received his bachelor's degree in Law, and his master's degree in Arts from the [[University College Thiruvananthapuram|University College]], [[Trivandrum]], India.&lt;ref name="author"/&gt; "After his degree at the age of 21, he stumbled up on an advertisement for the post of a lecturer in a High School in the city of [[Mysore]]."&lt;ref name="sais"/&gt; He acquired the position. After a few years, Kasturi began to "seriously contemplate on a career in Law."&lt;ref name="sais"/&gt;

Around 1928 he served as a lecturer in Maharaja's College of Arts (affiliated to the [[Mysore University]]).&lt;ref name="sais"/&gt; He served as the Secretary of the Sri Ramakrishna Mission in Mysore for over seventeen years. During these years he came into contact with Sri Siddharudha Swami, [[Ramana Maharshi]], [[Meher Baba]], and [[Narayana Guru]]; and was initiated into Japam by Mahapurushji, the direct disciple of [[Ramakrishna]] Paramahamsa.&lt;ref name="author"/&gt; He met [[Sathya Sai Baba]] in the year 1948 in Bangalore.&lt;ref name="sais"/&gt; In his first meeting with Sathya Sai Baba, Sai Baba related, ""After retiring from the University, stay with Me. You can write My biography." "Me?" Kasturi replied. "Yes, I shall tell you whom to consult for details – parents, brothers, kinsmen, neighbours, teachers, etc. I shall also help." It was July 1948."&lt;ref name="sais"/&gt; He began to write the life of Sathya Sai Baba and published it as ''Sathyam Sivam Sundaram'' Part I.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Narayana Kasturi M.A, B.L [http://laluni.helloyou.ws/askbaba/sathyamsivamsundaram/s1001.html Available Online]&lt;/ref&gt; He later became the editor of the magazine of the [[Sathya Sai Organization]], called ''[[Sanathana Sarathi (magazine)|Sanathana Sarathi]]''.

In 1949, "a University Order sent Mr. Kasturi to the Intermediate College, Davangere as its Principal."&lt;ref name="sais"/&gt;
Kasturi stayed on for five years and then retired.&lt;ref name="sais"/&gt; "When he retired in 1954 with a full year's pension, Swami (Sai Baba) suggested that he go on a spiritual pilgrimage to North India taking his mother and wife along."&lt;ref name="sais"/&gt;

In 1956, Sathya Sai Baba suggested, and in spite of Kasturi's reluctance, "convinced him to accept the offer of the post of Producer of Programmes for the newly established All India Radio Station, [[Bangalore]]."&lt;ref name="sais"/&gt;

Kasturi enjoyed the post immensely, and "during a visit to Bangalore in 1958, (Sathya Sai Baba) spotted him (Kasturi) at the residence of Mr. Vittal Rao and said, "Now, you have to work at [[Puttaparthi]]. A monthly magazine will start soon. Guess! How is it named?" 
"In the initial days of ''[[Sanathana Sarathi (magazine)|Sanathana Sarathi]]'', with no professional or skilled help of any kind, be it in writing and editing to printing, pasting and parceling, it was a tremendous responsibility for Professor Kasturi to ensure that the issue, flawless in every aspect, reached the readers on time."&lt;ref name="sais"/&gt;

Mrs. Geeta Ram, who watched and played with Professor Kasturi as a tiny girl in those days, recalls, "The whole process of type-setting would be repeated so many times. After the sheets were printed, the ink would still be wet. They would then have to be spread all over the floor to dry, so the ink would not smear. Later, the pages were carefully collated, stapled together, packed and addressed in preparation for mailing – all done by hand. Although there were a few volunteers to help him, I remember Professor Kasturi doing all these jobs, month in and month out, for so many years. This was truly his labor of love for Swami (Sathya Sai Baba)."&lt;ref name="sais"/&gt;

==As author==

Kasturi authored the work ''Sathyam Sivam Sundaram'' ("The Life of Sathya Sai Baba"),&lt;ref&gt;Narayana Kasturi, Author of ''Sathyam Sivam Sundaram'' [http://laluni.helloyou.ws/askbaba/sathyamsivamsundaram/index.html Available online]&lt;/ref&gt; which was translated into English as ''Truth, Goodness, Beauty''. The first part of book was published in 1960.&lt;ref name="reader"&gt;http://www.vahini.org/sss/iii/dearreader.html&lt;/ref&gt; As Kasturi states, it "is the story of the Lord, come in human form,".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vahini.org/sss/i/wonderm.html&lt;/ref&gt; The first book covers the first thirty four years of the life of Sathya Sai Baba. Kasturi states that he wrote about the early years of Sathya Sai Baba's life based on information gathered from Pedda-Venkapa Raju (Sai Baba's Father), Seshama Raju (Sai Baba's brother) and teachers from the schools in [[Bukkapatnam]] and [[Uravakonda]], where Sathyanarayana Raju (Sai Baba) was a student. The second part of the book was published in 1968&lt;ref name="reader"/&gt; and closed the first volume of ''Sathyam Sivam Sundaram''. Kasturi states that "ten eventful years had pass(ed)" between the publications of parts three and four.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vahini.org/sss/iv/betweenus.html&lt;/ref&gt; The second volume (and complete ''Sathyam Sivam Sundaram'') was published around 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vahini.org/sss/iv/thesongs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

"“He was no ordinary man, a scholar par excellence and a matchless writer,” says Anil Kumar"&lt;ref name="sais"/&gt; of Kasturi. He also proved his talent as a writer in the [[Kannada]] language, especially as a humourist as his writing was packed with humour and contained many jokes. He wrote more than 1000 articles. According to some sources, he named Mysore Radio station "Akashavani" while working for Gopalan.&lt;ref name="sais"/&gt; Narayana Kasturi translated the famous [[Malayalam]] novel ''[[Chemmeen]]'' into Kannada. N Kasturi (sometimes referred to as Na. Kasturi) was a regular contributor to the ''Koravanji''.

''Koravanji'', which he began on [[Ugadi]] Day in 1942, enjoyed a circulation of nearly two [[lakh]] (two hundred thousand). Rashi himself wrote the column "Koravavalokana", and was responsible in bringing the latent talents of many young writers to light. Some well-known names include Kefa, Bulla, Aa. Ra. Se, Na. Kasturi, C.K.N. Raja, Girani Ramsami, and [[T. Sunandamma]]. Though the magazine ceased publication in 1967 due to financial constraints, many of its writers remained in the field. Magazines devoted to humour came to the market, but none seemed to match the success of ''Koravanji''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2002/11/25/stories/2002112500740200.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

"People may come and go, there may be many speakers and writers, any number in the past, numerous in the present and many more in the future, but none can equal Kasturi in the art of oration and narration. His poetic style, nectarine language, convincing candour, and his soft and tender, appealing and devoted voice… Professor Kasturi is a legend, a personality too extraordinary to imitate or emulate,” says Professor Anil Kumar."&lt;ref name="sais"/&gt;

According to Lawrence A. Babb, virtually all existing accounts of Sathya Sai Baba's life were based on the [[hagiography|hagiographic]] writings of Narayana Kasturi.&lt;ref&gt;Babb, Lawrence A., ''Redemptive encounters: three modern styles in the Hindu tradition'', {{ISBN|0-520-05645-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, a highly detailed account of the first twenty four years of Sathya Sai Baba's life was published.&lt;ref&gt;''Love is My Form'', Vol. 1 [Sai Towers Publishing. Bangalore. {{ISBN|81-86822-77-1}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The author stated he was "eternally grateful to Professor N. Kasturi, the first official biographer of (Sai) Baba. At every stage, his magnum opus, ''Sathyam Sivam Sundaram'', has served as a pathway into the life of (Sai) Baba."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loveismyform.com/authornote.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728051710/http://www.loveismyform.com/authornote.htm |archivedate=28 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kasturi's autobiography. entitled ''Loving God: Eighty-five Years under the Watchful Eye of the Lord'', was published in 1982 by Sri Sathya Sai Books and Publications.&lt;ref&gt;Kasturi, Narayana ''Loving God. Eighty Five Years under the Watchful Eye of THE LORD'', 1982, [[Prasanthi Nilayam]], published by Sri Sathya Sai Books and Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper]] and his colleagues, including John M. Borst and [[Caryl Haskins]], at [[Haskins Laboratories]] in the late 1940s and completed in 1950. There were several different versions of this hardware device. Only one currently survives. The machine converts pictures of the acoustic patterns of speech in the form of a [[spectrogram]] back into sound. Using this device, [[Alvin Liberman]], Frank Cooper, and Pierre Delattre (later joined by [[Katherine Safford Harris]], [[Leigh Lisker]], and others) were able to discover acoustic cues for the perception of [[phonetic]] segments (consonants and vowels). This research  was fundamental to the development of modern techniques of [[speech synthesis]], [[reading machine]]s for the blind, the study of [[speech perception]] and [[speech recognition]], and the development of the [[motor theory of speech perception]].

To create sound, the pattern playback machine uses an arc light source which is directed against a rotating disk with 50 concentric tracks whose transparencies vary systematically in order to produce 50 harmonics of a fundamental frequency. The light is further projected against a [[spectrogram]] whose reflectance corresponds to the sound pressure level of the partial of the signal, and is then directed towards a photovoltaic cell by which the light variation is converted into sound pressure variations.

The pattern playback was last used in an experimental study by [[Robert Remez]] in 1976. The pattern playback now resides in the Museum at [[Haskins Laboratories]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

The technique of pattern playback also now refers, more generally, to algorithms or techniques for converting [[spectrogram]]s, cochleagrams, and correlograms from pictures back into sounds.

== Digital pattern playback ==
In the 1970s, digital pattern playbacks began to supplant the earlier version. In early prototype was developed at [[Haskins Laboratories]] which combined a "Ubiquitous Spectrum Analyzer" for automatic spectral analysis, along with a VAX GT-40 display processor for graphic manipulation of the displayed spectrogram, a form of "synthesis by art", and subsequent re-synthesis using a 40 channel filter bank. This hybrid hardware/software digital pattern playback was eventually replaced at [[Haskins Laboratories]] by the [[HADES]] software system, designed by [[Philip Rubin]], and implemented in [[Fortran]] on the [[VAX]] family of computers. A more modern version has been described by Arai and colleagues [https://web.archive.org/web/20070713224126/http://yuichi.splab.ee.sophia.ac.jp/Digital_Pattern_Playback/].

==Philosophical views==
Peter Hacker is one of the most powerful contemporary exponents of the linguistic-therapeutic approach to philosophy pioneered by Ludwig Wittgenstein. In this approach, the words and concepts used by the language community are taken as given, and the role of philosophy is to resolve or dissolve philosophical problems by giving an overview of the uses of these words and the structural relationships between these concepts. Philosophical inquiry is therefore very different from scientific inquiry, and Hacker maintains accordingly that there is a sharp dividing line between the two: "Philosophy is not a contribution to human knowledge, but to human understanding" (quoted from  [http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/scr/hacker/docs/Orrery%20of%20intentionality.pdf "An Orrery of Intentionality"]). This has led him into direct disagreement with "[[Neurophilosophy|neuro-philosophers]]": neuroscientists or philosophers such as [[Antonio Damasio]] and [[Daniel Dennett]] who think that neuroscience can shed light on philosophical questions such as the nature of [[consciousness]] or the [[mind-body problem]]. Hacker maintains that these, like all philosophical problems, are not real problems at all, but mirages arising from conceptual confusion. It follows that scientific inquiry (learning more facts about humans or the world) does not help to resolve them.
His 2003 book "Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience", co-authored with neuroscientist [[Max Bennett (scientist)|Max Bennett]], contains an exposition of these views, and critiques of the ideas of many contemporary neuroscientists and philosophers, including [[Francis Crick]], [[Antonio Damasio]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[John Searle]], and others.

Hacker in general finds many received components of current philosophy of mind to be incoherent.  He rejects [[Type physicalism|mind-brain identity theories]], as well as [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], [[Eliminative materialism|eliminativism]] and other forms of [[reductionism]].  He advocates methodological pluralism, denying that standard explanations of human conduct are causal, and insisting on the irreducibility of explanation in terms of reasons and goals.  He denies that psychological attributes can be intelligibly ascribed to the brain, insisting that they are ascribable only to the human being as a whole.  He has endeavoured to show that the puzzles and 'mysteries' of consciousness dissolve under careful analysis of the various forms of intransitive and transitive consciousness, and that so-called [[qualia]] are no more than a philosopher's fiction.  Together with M.R. Bennett, Hacker has stated that the eliminative materialist inevitably "saws off the branch on which he is seated." In the name of reason, truth, and science, he destroys all reason, truth, and science.&lt;ref&gt;Feser, Edward, The Last Superstition, St. Augustine Press 2008, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

Hacker has frequently collaborated with fellow Oxford philosopher [[G. P. Baker]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10631">'''Projective identification''' is a term introduced by [[Melanie Klein]] to describe the process whereby in a close relationship, as between mother and child, lovers, or therapist and patient, parts of the self may in unconscious [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] be thought of as being forced into the other person.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

While based on Freud's concept of [[psychological projection]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melanie-klein-trust.org.uk/projective-identification Projective identification]&lt;/ref&gt; projective identification represents a step beyond. In [[R.D. Laing]]'s words, "The one person does not use the [[Other (philosophy)|other]] merely as a hook to hang projections on. He/she strives to find in the other, or to induce the other to become, the very embodiment of projection".&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (Penguin 1969) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Feelings which can not be consciously accessed are [[defense mechanism|defensively]] projected into another person in order to evoke the thoughts or feelings projected.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jacobs, ''Psychodynamic Counselling in Action'' (London 2006), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

Projective identification may be used as a type of defense, a means of communicating, a primitive form of relationship, or a route to psychological change;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jan Grant and Jim Crawley, ''Transference and Projection''(Buckingham 2002), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  used for ridding the self of unwanted parts or for controlling the other's body and mind.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''On Learning from the Patient'' (1985) p. 100n&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experience==
Though a difficult concept for the conscious mind to come to terms with,&lt;ref&gt;Priscilla Roth, 'Projective Identification', in S. Budd/R.Rusbridger eds., ''Introducing Psychoanalysis'' (2005) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; since its primitive nature makes its operation or interpretation seem more like magic or art than science,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; projective identification is nonetheless a powerful tool of interpersonal communication.

The recipient of the projection may suffer a loss of both identity and insight as they are caught up in and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulated]] by the other person's fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (Penguin 1969) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; One therapist, for example, describes how "I felt the progressive extrusion of his internalized mother into me, not as a theoretical construct but in actual experience. The intonation of my voice altered, became higher with the distinctly ''Ur-mutter'' quality."&lt;ref&gt;David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (Penguin 1974) p. 113–4&lt;/ref&gt; If the projection can be accepted and understood, however, much insight into the projector will be obtained.

Projective identification differs from simple projection in that projective identification can become a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], whereby a person, believing something false about another, influences or coerces that other person to carry out that precise projection.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath/Terence Dawson, ''The Cambridge Companion to Jung'' (Cambridge 1977) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme cases, the recipient may lose any sense of their real self and become reduced to the passive carrier of outside projections, as if possessed by them.&lt;ref&gt;T. Pitt-Aikens/A. T. Ellis, ''Loss of the Good Authority'' (London 1989) p. 120 and p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objects projected==

The objects (feelings, attitudes) extruded in projective identification are of various kinds – both good and bad, ideal and [[Abjection|abjected]].

Hope may be projected by a client into their therapist, when they can no longer consciously feel it themselves;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 121-2&lt;/ref&gt; equally, it may be a fear of (psychic) dying which is projected.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes'' (2000) p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggression may be projected, leaving the projector's personality diminished and reduced;&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (2006) p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively it may be desire, leaving the projector feeling asexual.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 69–73&lt;/ref&gt;

The good/ideal parts of the personality may be projected, leading to dependence upon the object of identification;&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (1998) p. 86-7&lt;/ref&gt; equally it may be jealousy or [[envy]] that are projected, perhaps by the therapist into the client.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (1993) p. 11–2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intensity==

Projective identification may take place with varying degrees of intensity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/projective-identification Robert D. Hinshelwood, "Projective Identification"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[narcissism]], extremely powerful projections may take place and obliterate the distinction between self and other.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal, Klein (1979) p. 116–9&lt;/ref&gt;

In less disturbed personalities, projective identification is not only a way of getting rid of feelings but also of getting help with them.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 98–9&lt;/ref&gt;

In an emotionally balanced person, projective identification may act as a bridge to [[empathy]] and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive understanding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/projective-identification Robert D. Hinshelwood, "Projective Identification"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Various types of projective identification have been distinguished over the years:
* '''Acquisitive projective identification''' - where someone takes on the attributes of someone else. Unlike '''attributive projective identification''', where someone else is induced to become one's own projection.&lt;ref&gt;John Rowan and Michael Jacobs, ''The Therapist's Use of Self'' (Buckingham 2002) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Projective counter-identification''' - where the therapist unwittingly assumes the feelings and role of the patient to the point where he acts out within the therapy within this assumed role that has been projected into him, a step beyond the therapist merely receiving the patient's projections without acting on them.&lt;ref&gt;Grinberg L (1962) On a specific aspect of countertransference due to the patient's projective identification (In Classics of Psychoanalytical Technique)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Dual projective identification''' - a concept introduced by [[Joan Lachkar]]. It primarily occurs when both partners in a relationship simultaneously project onto one another. Both deny the projections, both identify with those projections.&lt;ref&gt;''The Narcissistic/Borderline Couple: A Psychoanalytic Perspective on Marital Treatment (1st ed.).'' New York: Brunner/Mazel, 1992. {{ISBN|0-87630-634-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A division has also been made between '''normal projective identification''' and '''pathological projective identification''', where what is projected is splintered into minute pieces before the projection takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal,''Introduction to the work of Melanie Klein'' (London 1964), p. 42-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychotherapy==

As with [[transference]] and [[countertransference]], projective identification can be a potential key to therapeutic understanding, especially where the therapist is able to tolerate and contain the unwanted, negative aspects of the patient's self over time.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Stewart, ''Psychic Experience and Problems of Technique'' (London 1992), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transactional analysis]] emphasizes the need for the therapist's Adult to remain uncontaminated, if the experience of the client's projective identification is to be usefully understood.&lt;ref&gt;Petruska Clarkson, ''On Psychotherapy'' (London 1993), p. 180 and p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wounded couple==

Relationship problems have been linked to the way there can be a division of [[emotional labour]] in a couple, by way of projective identification, with one partner carrying projected aspects of the other for them.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one partner may carry all the aggression or all the competence in the relationship, the other all the vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;R. Skynner/J. Cleese, ''Families and how to survive them'' (1993) p. 47–54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung|Jungians]] describe the resultant dynamics as characterising a so-called "wounded couple" – projective identification ensuring that each carries the most ideal or the most primitive parts of their counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath and Terence Dawson eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Jung'' (Cambridge 1997) p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; The two partners may initially have been singled out for that very readiness to carry parts of each other's self; but the projected inner conflicts/division then come to be replicated in the partnership itself.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath and Terence Dawson eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Jung'' (Cambridge 1997) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

Conscious resistance to such projective identification&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath and Terence Dawson eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Jung'' (Cambridge 1997) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; may produce on the one side [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] for refusing to enact the projection,&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (Penguin 1969) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; on the other bitter rage at the thwarting of the projection.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1993) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=March 2009}}
The '''prompter''' (Fr., Ger. ''souffleur''; It. ''rammentatore'', ''suggeritore'') in an [[opera]] house gives the singers the opening words of each phrase a few seconds early. Prompts are mouthed silently or hurled lyrically in a half-voice, audible (hopefully) only on stage. (This is in contrast to the [[Prompter (theatre)|prompter]] in a [[Theatre (building)|theatre]] who aids actors who have forgotten their words or lines.)

Opera prompters are traditionally housed in a stuffy wooden box at the center-front edge of the stage, above the [[orchestra pit]]. They are visible to the performers and no one else. Technology has brought [[air conditioner|cool air]] and small display screens, among other advances, to support their work.

Effective prompting can be a challenge. The American prompter Philip Eisenberg recounts the story at a [[Maria Callas]] performance when she needed louder prompts. The famed diva swooped down in a curtsy right in front of the prompter’s box and — mid-curtsy, unnoticed by the audience — gave the Italian command "più forte!" (louder) to her boxed colleague.{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Prompters attend all rehearsals, mark up any adjustments or clarifications to the score, and generally "prepare" singers for a role. Their profile is low, and opera program books often credit them only under "musical preparation" or some similar moniker.

'''Shu'ubiyyah''' ({{lang-ar|الشعوبية}}) refers to the response by non-Arab [[Muslim]]s to the privileged status of [[Arabs]] within the [[Ummah]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Terminology==
The name of the movement is derived from the Qur'anic use of the word for "nations" or "peoples", ''shu'ūb''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jamshidian Tehrani|first=Jafar|title=Shu'ubiyya: Independence movements in Iran|year=2014| isbn=978-1500737306|url=https://www.amazon.com/Shuubiyya-Independence-movements-Iran-Persian/dp/1500737305/ref=asap_B00NPP8V80_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414967289&amp;sr=1-2}}, p.3 preface&lt;/ref&gt; The verse (49:13) is often used by Muslims to counter prejudice and fighting among different people.
&lt;blockquote&gt;:يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ وَأُنثَى وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ &lt;span style="color:black;"&gt;شُعُوباً&lt;/span&gt; وَ&lt;span style="color:black;"&gt;قَبَائِلَ&lt;/span&gt; لِتَعَارَفُوا إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌ&lt;br&gt;O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations (''shu'ūb'') and tribes (''qabā'il''), that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things).&lt;ref&gt;[[Qur'an]] in [[Sura]]h 49, verse 13.(translated by [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Socio-political movements==
The use of the word in the context of a movement existed before the 9th century. The [[Khawarij|Kharijites]], an early splitoff sect from mainstream [[Islam]], used it to mean extending equality between the shu'ub and the qaba'il to bring about equality among all followers of Islam. It was a direct response to the claims by the [[Quraysh]] of being privileged to lead the [[Ummah]], or community of believers.

===In Iran===
{{Main|Islamization of Iran}}
When used as a reference to a specific movement, the term refers to a response by [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Muslim]]s to the growing [[Arabization]] of [[Islam]] in the 9th and 10th centuries in [[Iran]]. It was primarily concerned with preserving Persian culture and protecting Persian identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jamshidian Tehrani|first=Jafar|title=Shu'ubiyya: Independence movements in Iran|year=2014| isbn=978-1500737306|url=https://www.amazon.com/Shuubiyya-Independence-movements-Iran-Persian/dp/1500737305/ref=asap_B00NPP8V80_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414967289&amp;sr=1-2}}, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable effect of the movement was the survival of [[Persian language]], the language of the Persians, to the present day. However, the movement never moved into apostasy and has its basis in the Islamic thought of equality of races and nations.

In the late 8th and early 9th centuries, there was a resurgence of Persian national identity.  This came about after years of oppression by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The movement left substantial records in the form of Persian literature and new forms of poetry. Most of those behind the movement were Persian, but references to [[Egyptians]], [[Berbers]] and [[Arameans]] are attested.&lt;ref&gt;Enderwitz, S. "Shu'ubiyya". ''Encyclopedia of Islam''. Vol. IX (1997), pp. 513-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Al-Andalus===
Two centuries after the end of the Shu'ubiyyah movement in the east, another form of the movement came about in Islamic Spain and was controlled by [[Muladi]] (Iberian Muslims). It was fueled mainly by the [[Berber people|Berbers]], but included many European cultural groups as well including [[Galicians]], [[Catalans]] (known by that time as [[Franks]]), [[Calabria]]ns, and [[Basques]]. A notable example of ''Shu'ubi'' literature is the epistle (''[[risalah (fiqh)|risala]]'') of the Andalusian poet [[Ibn Gharsiya]] (Garcia).&lt;ref&gt;''The Shu'ubiyya in al-Andalus. The risala of Ibn Garcia and five refutations'' (University of California Press 1970), translated with an introduction and notes by [[James T. Monroe]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diesenberger|first=Max|author2=Richard Corradini |author3=Helmut Reimitz |title=The construction of communities in the early Middle Ages: texts, resources and artefacts|publisher=Brill|year=2003| isbn=90-04-11862-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6sfGt10UzcC}}, p.346&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature'', however, this epistle was merely of minor importance, and its few exponents tended to repeat clichés adopted from the earlier Islamic East, e.g., Iran.

==Neo-Shu'ubiyya==
In 1966, Sami Hanna and G.H. Gardner wrote an article "Al-Shu‘ubiyah Updated" in the Middle East Journal.&lt;ref&gt;Sami Hanna and G.H. Gardner, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=zsoUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA80 Al-Shu‘ubiyah Updated]", [[Middle East Journal]], 20 (1966): 335-351&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch university professor Leonard C. Biegel, in his 1972 book ''Minorities in the Middle East: Their significance as political factor in the Arab World'', coined from the article of Hanna and Gardner the term ''Neo-Shu'ubiyah'' to name the modern attempts of alternative non-Arab and often non-Muslim nationalisms in the Middle East, e.g. [[Assyrian nationalism]], [[Kurdish nationalism]], [[Pharaonism]], [[Phoenicianism]], [[Syrian nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Leonard C. Biegel, {{lang-nl|Minderheden in Het Midden-Oosten: Hun Betekenis Als Politieke Factor in De Arabische Wereld}}, Van Loghum Slaterus, Deventer}}, 1972, {{ISBN|978-90-6001-219-2 e.g. p.250&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1984 article, Daniel Dishon and Bruce Maddi-Weitzmann use the same neologism, ''Neo-Shu'ubiyya''.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Dishon and Bruce Maddi-Weitzmann, "Inter-Arab issues", in: {{cite book|title=Israel, the Middle East, and the great powers|editor=Israel Stockman-Shomron|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1984|pages=389|isbn=978-965-287-000-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AgrbCtWpV58C&amp;pg=PA279|accessdate=2009-11-24}} e.g. p.279&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these groups, more particularly the [[Kurds]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Yezidis]] and [[Mandaeans]], together with a very small number of [[Mhallami]] are not actually Arabs nor Arabic speakers, and have been shown to have upheld a distinct identity both before and after the Arab-Islamic conquest of the [[Near East]].

In a 2002 article, Ariel I. Ahram pointed out a similar modern meaning of the term shu'ubiya against Iraqi Shi'a Muslims, and more generally against Shi'a Islam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahram |first=Ariel I. |date=Spring 2002|title=Iraq and Syria: The Dilemma of Dynasty |journal=Middle East Quarterly|volume=IX|issue=2|url=http://www.meforum.org/171/iraq-and-syria-the-dilemma-of-dynasty}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Implicit throughout Saddam's rejection of "the Khomeini religion" was the accusation that any Iran-centered practice of Islam was shu‘ubiya—a term originally applied to non-Arab Muslims, mainly Persians, who resisted Arab claims to be the prime inheritors of the prophet. The [[Ba'athism|Ba‘th]] sought to portray Khomeini and Iran as heirs of these early Islamic dissenters. Saddam then invited Iraqi Shi‘ites to divest themselves of their shu‘ubi tendencies and their reverence for Iranian religious leaders and return to the authentically Arab Islam.

'''Sprigging''' is the planting of '''sprigs''', plant sections cut from [[rhizome]]s or [[stolon]]s that includes [[Crown (botany)|crowns]] and [[root]]s, at spaced intervals in [[furrows]] or holes.&lt;ref name=utextension&gt;{{ cite report | title=Turfgrass Establishment: Sprigging | year=2007 | publisher=The University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture | author=University of Tennessee Extension | url=https://utextension.tennessee.edu/publications/Documents/W160-D.pdf | format=PDF | work=UT Extension Publications | accessdate=22 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the environment, this may be done by hand or with mechanical row planters.&lt;ref name=utextension/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brede2000"/&gt; Sprigging uses no soil with the plant, and is an alternative to seeding (planting seeds directly), plugging (transplanting [[Plug (horticulture)|plugs]] with intact soil and roots), and sodding (installing harvested sheets of [[sod]]).&lt;ref name="Brede2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brede|first=Doug|title=Turfgrass Maintenance Reduction Handbook: Sports, Lawns, and Golf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJgaza9GmHEC&amp;pg=PA159|date=15 March 2000|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-57504-106-3|pages=155–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stolonizing is essentially broadcast sprigging, using cut [[stolon]]s and [[rhizome]]s spread uniformly over an area mechanically or by hand, then covered with soil or pressed into the planting bed by various means.&lt;ref name="Brede2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tva&gt;{{cite book|author=Tennessee Valley Authority|title=Natural Resource Plan: Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia: Final Environmental Impact Statement, Volume 1|url=http://www.tva.com/environment/reports/nrp/pdf/finals/nrp_feis_volume1.pdf|year=2011|page=82|format=PDF|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrosprigging, similar to [[hydroseeding]], is the use of sprigs or cut stolons and rhizomes in a [[slurry]] of fertilizer, mulch, and binding agent, sprayed with a hose over a target area.&lt;ref name=utextension/&gt; This can be effective in areas sensitive to soil surface disturbance, such as eroding shorelines, hillsides or other slopes of varying steepness, or in diversion channels.&lt;ref name=tva/&gt; The slurry can be sprayed over {{convert|1000|ft|m}} from a {{convert|1.5|inch|cm|abbr=on}} hose.&lt;ref name=utextension/&gt;

'''Teeline''' is a [[shorthand]] system developed in 1968 by [[James Hill (stenographer)|James Hill]],&lt;ref name=Hill1968&gt;{{citation |last=Hill |first=James |year=1968 |title=Teeline: a method of fast writing |publisher=London, Heinemann Educational |oclc=112342}}&lt;/ref&gt; a teacher of [[Pitman Shorthand]].&lt;ref name=bowers1991/&gt; It is accepted by the [[National Council for the Training of Journalists]], which certifies the training of journalists in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=bowers1991&gt;{{cite book |first=Meriel|last=Bowers|first2=Jean|last2=Clarkson|first3=Stephanie|last3=Hall|first4=Celia|last4=Osborne|first5=Ulli|last5=Parkinson|year=1991 |title=Teeline Gold (The Course Book) |edition=1 |publisher=Heinemann Educational |location=Oxford |isbn=0-435-45353-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is mainly used within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], but can be adapted for use by [[Germanic languages]] such as German and Swedish. Its strength over other forms of shorthand is fast learning, and speeds of up to 150 words per minute are possible,&lt;ref name="pressgazette"&gt;[http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=25882&amp;sectioncode=1 www.pressgazette.co.uk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616193344/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=25882&amp;sectioncode=1 |date=2011-06-16 }}, Reporter breaks shorthand record&lt;/ref&gt; with it being common for users to create their own word groupings, increasing their speed.&lt;ref name=bowers1991/&gt;

==Writing style==
Teeline shorthand is a streamlined way to transcribe the spoken word quickly by removing unnecessary letters from words and making the letters themselves faster to write.&lt;ref name=bowers1991/&gt; Vowels are often removed when they are not the first or last letter of a word, and [[silent letter]]s are also ignored.&lt;ref name=bowers1991/&gt; Common prefixes, suffixes, and letter groupings (such as "sh" and "ing") are reduced to single symbols. The symbols themselves are derived from the old cursive forms of the letter and the unnecessary parts are again stripped leaving only the core of the letter left.&lt;ref name=bowers1991/&gt; Unlike phonetics based shorthands, such as Pitman, Teeline is a spelling based system.

==Alphabet==
[[Image:teeline-alphabet.jpg|thumb|The Teeline Alphabet]]
Teeline differs from many shorthand systems by basing itself on the alphabet as opposed to phonetics, making it simpler to learn but also carrying the speed limitations of the alphabet when compared to other systems.&lt;ref name=bowers1991/&gt; However, it is common to find some phonetics spellings used. For example, ''ph'' is often just written as an ''f'', so the word ''phase'' would be written as if it were spelt ''fase''. This coincides with the creator's intentions of streamlining it as much as possible.&lt;ref name=bowers1991/&gt; As with many shorthand systems, there are few strict rules on how to write it, so it is common for users to make personal adaptations for their own use.&lt;ref name=bowers1991/&gt; Certain letters also have specific meanings as well as their traditional alphabetic value, as shown in the table below.

''Note: there may also be some regional, dialectal, and linguistic additions to these as well.''

==Writing technique==
Teeline eliminates unnecessary letters, so that the remaining letters can be written in one swift, sweeping movement. People who use it daily will run words together: proficient users develop their own forms for common phrases, such as "more and more people" and "in the end".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/news-agency-boss-says-journalism-degrees-which-dont-offer-shorthand-are-del-boy-courses/|title=News agency boss says journalism degrees which don’t offer shorthand are ‘Del Boy’ courses – Press Gazette|website=www.pressgazette.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to write most words using basic Teeline theory, which consists of the alphabet and vowel indicators, but learning advanced Teeline theory allows users to increase their speed to well in excess of 100 words per minute.

Examples of Teeline theory include blending of letters (such as CM, CN and PL) and the R principle.

Doubling is also commonly used in Teeline - this involves lengthening the outlines for D, T, L, M and W to indicate that an R comes after these outlines - for example, the "D" outline becomes "DR" when it is lengthened, and "M" becomes "MR".

Speed can be dramatically increased through the use of reduced suffixes and prefixes that occur frequently, such as "under-", "multi-" and "trans-", along with "-nce", "nch", "-able" and "-ing".

Terms used to describe [[homosexuality]] have gone through many changes since the emergence of the first terms in the mid-19th century.  In English, some terms in widespread use have been [[Sodomy|sodomite]], [[Sapphic love|Sapphic]], [[Uranian]], [[homophile]], [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Two-Spirit|two-spirit]], and same-sex attracted. Some of these words are specific to women, some to men, and some can be used of either. Gay people may also be identified under the [[umbrella term]]s [[queer]] and [[LGBT]].

''[[Homosexual]]'' was coined in 1868. Academia continues to coin related terms, including ''[[androphilia]]'' and ''[[gynephilia]]'' which designate only the object of attraction, thus divorcing the terms from sexual orientation entirely. 

Numerous slang terms exist for homosexuals or homosexuality. Some communities have [[cant (language)|cants]], a rich jargon used among a subgroup almost like a secret language, such as [[Polari]] in the U.K., and others.

==Prescribed usage==

The term [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] can be used as an adjective to describe the sexual attractions and behaviors of people attracted to the same sex. Author and gay pioneer [[Quentin Crisp]] said that the term should be "homosexualist," adding that no one says "I am a sexual." Some gay people argue that the use of homosexual as a noun is offensive, arguing that they are people first and their homosexuality being merely an attribute of their humanity. Even if they do not consider the term offensive, some people in same-sex relationships may object to being described as homosexual because they identify as [[bisexuality|bisexual]], [[pansexuality|pansexual]], or another orientation.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Some style guides recommend that the terms homosexual and homosexuality be avoided altogether, lest their use cause confusion or arouse controversy. In particular, the description of individuals as homosexual may be offensive, partially because of the negative clinical association of the word stemming from its use in describing same-sex attraction as a [[pathology|pathological]] state before homosexuality was removed from the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s list of mental disorders in 1973.&lt;ref name=GLAADMediaGuide&gt;GLAAD [http://www.glaad.org/reference/offensive GLAAD Media Reference Guide - Terms To Avoid]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] and [[New York Times]] style guides restrict usage of the terms.&lt;ref name=GLADNYAP&gt;GLAAD [http://www.glaad.org/reference/style GLAAD Media Reference Guide - AP &amp; New York Times Style]&lt;/ref&gt;

Same-sex oriented people seldom apply such terms to themselves, and public officials and agencies often avoid them. For instance, the Safe Schools Coalition of Washington's ''Glossary for School Employees'' advises that ''gay'' is the "preferred synonym for homosexual",&lt;ref name = "Safe Schools Coalition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safeschoolscoalition.org/glossary.pdf |title=Glossary |publisher=Safe Schools Coalition |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and goes on to suggest avoiding the term homosexual as it is "clinical, distancing, and archaic".

However, the term homosexual and homosexuality is sometimes deemed appropriate in referring to behavior (although same-sex is the preferred adjective). Using homosexuality or homosexual to refer to behavior may be inaccurate but does not carry the same potentially offensive connotations that using homosexual to describe a person does. When referring to people, homosexual is considered derogatory and the terms gay and lesbian are preferred. Some have argued that homosexual places emphasis on sexuality over humanity, and is to be avoided when describing a person. Gay man or lesbian are the preferred nouns for referring to people, which stress cultural and social matters over sex.&lt;ref name = "Safe Schools Coalition" /&gt;

{{wiktionary|gay|lesbian|bisexual}}
The ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/gay?q=gay |title=NOAD |publisher=Oxford University Press |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; says that "gay" is the preferred term.

People with a same-sex sexual orientation generally prefer the terms gay, lesbian, or bisexual. The most common terms are gay (both men and women) and [[lesbian]] (women only). Other terms include [[same gender loving]] and same-sex-oriented''.''&lt;ref name="GLAADMediaGuide" /&gt;

Among some sectors of gay sub-culture, same-sex sexual behavior is sometimes viewed as solely for physical pleasure instead of romantic. Men on the [[Down-low (sexual slang)|down-low]] (or DL) may engage in covert sexual activity with other men while pursuing sexual and romantic relationships with women.

==History==

The choice of terms regarding [[sexual orientation]] may imply a certain political outlook, and different terms have been preferred at different times and in different places.

===Early history===
{{wiktionary|heterosexual}}
Historian and philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] argued that homosexual and [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] identities didn't emerge until the 19th century. Prior to that time, the terms described practices and not identity. Foucault cited [[Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal|Karl Westphal]]'s famous 1870 article ''Contrary Sexual Feeling'' as the "date of birth" of the categorization of sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=Foucault1976&gt;Foucault, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] described (through the character of the profane comedian [[Aristophanes]]) three sexual orientations,{{Such as?|reason=this is the terminology article; there's no point asserting this, and then not giving the actual terms Plato used|date=March 2018}} and provided explanations for their existence using an invented [[Greek mythology|creation myth]].&lt;ref name=glbtq&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/literature/classical_myth,6.html Classical Myth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405231533/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/classical_myth%2C6.html |date=2005-04-05 }} on [[glbtq.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes's fable is only one of many perspectives on love in the ''Symposium'', and should not be considered identical with Plato's own ideas. Most of the ''Symposium'''s speeches are intended to be flawed in different ways, with the wise Socrates coming in at the end to correct their errors.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Tribadism===
{{wiktionary|tribadism}}
{{Main|Tribadism}}

Although this term refers to a specific [[Lesbian sexual practices|sex act between women]] today, in the past it was commonly used to describe female-female sexual love in general, and women who had sex with women were called Tribads or Tribades. As author [[Rictor Norton]] explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''tribas'', lesbian, from Greek ''tribein'', to rub (i.e. rubbing the [[Pudendal cleft|pudenda]] together, or [[clitoris]] upon [[Pubis (bone)|pubic bone]], etc.), appears in Greek and Latin satires from the late first century. The tribade was the most common (vulgar) lesbian in European texts for many centuries. ‘Tribade’ occurs in English texts from at least as early as 1601 to at least as late as the mid-nineteenth century before it became self-consciously old-fashioned—it was in current use for nearly three centuries.&lt;ref name="Norton"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Rictor Norton]] |title=A Critique of Social Constructionism and Postmodern Queer Theory, "The 'Sodomite' and the 'Lesbian' |publisher=infopt.demon.co.uk |date=July 12, 2002 |accessdate=July 30, 2011 |url=http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/social22.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215084530/http://www.infopt.demon.co.uk/social22.htm |archivedate=February 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Fricatrice'', a synonym for ''tribade'' that also refers to rubbing but has a Latin rather than a Greek root, appeared in English as early as 1605 (in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Volpone]]''). Its usage suggests that it was more colloquial and more [[pejorative]] than ''tribade''. Variants include the Latinized ''confricatrice'' and English ''rubster''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Andreadis |first=Harriette |title=Sappho in Early Modern England: Female Same-Sex Literary Erotics, 1550–1714 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001 |pages=41, 49–51 |isbn=0-226-02009-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sodomy===
{{wiktionary|sodomite}}
{{Main|Sodomy}}

Though ''sodomy'' has been used to refer to a range of homosexual and heterosexual "[[unnatural act]]s", the term [[Sodomy|sodomite]] usually refers to a homosexual male even though the real meaning is of unreproductive sex.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Barnes' Notes on the Bible&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent's Word Studies&lt;/ref&gt; The term is derived from the Biblical tale of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], and Christian churches have referred to the ''crimen sodomitae'' (crime of the Sodomites) for centuries. The modern association with homosexuality can be found as early as AD 96 in the writings of the Jewish historian [[Josephus]]. In the early 5th century, [[Jerome]], a priest, historian, and theologian used the forms Sodoman, in Sodomis, Sodomorum, Sodomæ, Sodomitæ.&lt;ref name=Hallam1993&gt;Hallam 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The modern German word ''Sodomie'' and the Norwegian ''sodomi'' refer to [[Zoophilia|bestiality]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}
Sodomy in historical biblical reference may not pertain to the acts of homosexuality, but the acts of bestiality and female and male [[castration]] for the purpose of [[sexual slavery]].

===Lesbianism===
{{wiktionary|lesbian}}
{{Main|Lesbian}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
Lesbian writer [[Emma Donoghue]] found that the term [[lesbian]] (with its modern meaning) has been in use in the English language from at least the 17th century. The 1732 [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] by [[William King (St Mary Hall)|William King]], ''The Toast'', uses "lesbian loves" and "tribadism" interchangeably: "she loved Women in the same Manner as Men love them; she was a Tribad".

===Sapphism===
{{wiktionary|sapphism}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
Named after the Greek poet [[Sappho]] who lived on [[Lesbos Island]] and wrote love poems to women, this term has been in use since at least the 18th century, with the connotation of lesbian. In 1773, a London magazine described sex between women as "Sapphic passion". The adjective form ''Sapphic'' is no longer commonly used in the English language, but has started to once again gain traction in the millennial LGBT community.

===Pederasty===
{{wiktionary|pederast}}
{{Main|Pederasty}}

Today, pederasty refers to male attraction towards adolescent boys,&lt;ref&gt;Based on the [[OED]] definition: "A man who has or desires sexual relations with a boy."&lt;/ref&gt; or the cultural institutions that support such relations, as in ancient Greece.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} However, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the term usually referred to male homosexuality in general.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} A pederast was also the active partner in anal sex, whether with a male or a female partner.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Homosexual===
{{wiktionary|homosexual}}
[[File:Homosexual.jpg|frame|[[Karl-Maria Kertbeny]] coined the word ''homosexual'' in this 1868 letter.]]
{{Main|Homosexuality}}
The word homosexual translates literally as "of the same sex", being a hybrid of the [[Greek language|Greek]] prefix ''homo-'' meaning "same" (as distinguished from the [[Latin]] root ''homo'' meaning ''human'') and the Latin root ''sex'' meaning "sex".

The first known appearance of the term homosexual in print is found in an 1869 German pamphlet ''143 des Preussischen Strafgesetzbuchs und seine Aufrechterhaltung als 152 des Entwurfs eines Strafgesetzbuchs für den Norddeutschen Bund'' ("Paragraph 143 of the [[Prussia]]n Penal Code and Its Maintenance as Paragraph 152 of the Draft of a Penal Code for the [[North German Confederation]]"). The pamphlet was written by [[Karl-Maria Kertbeny]], but published anonymously. It advocated the repeal of [[Prussia]]'s [[sodomy law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough et al. ed. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Kertbeny had previously used the word in a private letter written in 1868 to Karl Heinrich Ulrichs. Kertbeny used ''Homosexualität'' (in English, "homosexuality") in place of Ulrichs' ''Urningtum''; ''Homosexualisten'' ("male homosexualists") instead of ''Urninge'', and ''Homosexualistinnen'' ("female homosexualists") instead of ''Urninden''.

The first known use of homosexual in English is in [[Charles Gilbert Chaddock]]'s 1892 translation of [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]'s ''Psychopathia Sexualis'', a study on sexual practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Halperin]], ''One Hundred Years of Homosexuality'', Routledge, 1990, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularized by the 1906 [[Harden-Eulenburg Affair]].

The word ''homosexual'' itself had different connotations 100 years ago than today.

Although some early writers used the adjective ''homosexual'' to refer to any single-gender context (such as an all-girls school),{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} today the term implies a sexual aspect. The term [[homosociality|homosocial]] is now used to describe single-sex contexts that are not of a romantic or sexual nature.&lt;ref&gt;Merl Storr, ''Latex and Lingerie'' (2003) p. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

The colloquial abbreviation homo for homosexual is a coinage of the [[interbellum period]], first recorded as a noun in 1929, and as an adjective in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "homo, ''n.''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''a.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, it is often considered a derogatory [[epithet]]&lt;ref&gt;Wolinsky and Sherrill (eds.), ''Gays and the military: Joseph Steffan versus the United States'', Princeton University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|978-0-691-01944-4}}, p. 49-55.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mainstream media]] outlets restrict its usage.&lt;ref name=GLADNYAP/&gt;

===Other late 19th and early 20th century sexological terms===
* Antipathic sexual instinct: [[Paraphilia|deviant sexual behavior]] outlined in [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]'s ''Pychopathia Sexualis''&lt;ref&gt;Used by [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] in "Psychopathia Sexualis, with Special Reference to the Antipathic Sexual Instinct: A Medico-Forensic Study", 1886.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sexual inversion (sexology)|Sexual inversion]]&lt;ref&gt;Used by Krafft-Ebing and also [[Havelock Ellis]] and [[John Addington Symonds]] in "Sexual Inversion", 1897. Popularised by [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s use of it in her novel ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Psychosexual hermaphroditism: [[bisexuality]]. It was believed gay men desired a female body and lesbians desired a male body. Bisexuals desired to become [[intersex]].&lt;ref&gt;Used by Krafft-Ebing and later Ellis to mean bisexuality, as opposed to complete inversion (exclusive homosexuality). Freud uses the term in "Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality" (1905) to refer to male homosexuality.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The intermediate sex: similar to sexual inversion, Edward Carpenter believed gay men possessed a male body and a female temperament and vice versa for lesbians&lt;ref&gt;Used by Edward Carpenter in "The Intermediate Sex", 1908&lt;/ref&gt;
* Similisexualism or similsexualism: homosexuality&lt;ref&gt;Used by Edward Irenaeus Prime-Stevenson [writing as Xavier Mayne] in "The Intersexes: A History of Similisexualism as a Problem in Social Life", 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Intersex|Intersexuality]]&lt;ref&gt;Used around 1900 as a synonym for "inversion"; the term now has a different meaning—see [[intersexuality]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=November 2017}}

===Homophile===
{{wiktionary|homophile}}
{{Main|Homophile}}
Popular in the 1950s and 1960s (and still in occasional use today, particularly in writing by [[Church of England|Anglican]] clergy),&lt;ref name="btinternet1991"&gt;''Issues in Human Sexuality: A Statement by the House of Bishops of the General Synod of the Church of England'', December 1991 (London: Church House Publishing, 1991). {{cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~j.p.richardson/issues.html|title=Annotated Notes on ''Issues in Human Sexuality''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203000000/http://www.btinternet.com/~j.p.richardson/issues.html|archivedate=3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term homophile was an attempt to avoid the clinical implications of sexual pathology found with the word homosexual, emphasizing love ([[-phil-|-phile]]) instead.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In Norway, the term is still widely used.&lt;ref&gt;[[:nn:Homofili|"Homofili"]], from [http://nn.wikipedia.org Norsk (nynorsk) Wikipedia], entry retrieved 2012-06-19. Original text: &lt;span lang="nn"&gt;"I den grad «homophile» hadde fått noko gjennomslag i engelsk og amerikansk, overtok «homosexual», «gay» og «lesbian» denne plassen frå slutten av 1960-talet. «Homofili» blei første gong nytta på norsk i ein brosjyre av den norske avdelinga av det danske «Forbundet af 1948» i 1951. Noreg er eit av dei få (det einaste?) landet der dette omgrepet framleis har stor utbreiing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent academic terms==
{{wiktionary|androphilia|gynephilia}}
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
Not all terms have been used to describe same-sex sexuality are synonyms for the modern term [[homosexuality]].  [[Anna Rüling]], one of the first women to publicly defend gay rights, considered gay people a [[third gender]], different from both men and women. Terms such as [[Androphilia and gynephilia|gynephilia and androphilia]] have tried to simplify the language of sexual orientation by making no claim about the individual's own gender identity. However, they are not commonly used.

==Jargon and slang==

===Cants===

There are established languages of slang (sometimes known as [[cant (language)|cants]]) such as [[Polari]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Swardspeak]] in the [[Philippines]], [[Bahasa Binan]] in [[Indonesia]], and Kaliardá (Καλιαρντά) in [[Greece]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

===Slang===

A variety of [[LGBT slang]] terms have been used historically and contemporarily within the [[LGBT community]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In addition to the [[social stigma|stigma]] surrounding homosexuality, terms have been influenced by taboos around sex in general, producing a number of [[euphemism]]s. A gay person may be described as "that way", "a bit funny", "on the bus", "batting for the other team", "a [[friend of Dorothy]]", or "wearing comfortable shoes" (for women), although such euphemisms are becoming less common as homosexuality becomes more visible.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

[[Harry Hay]] frequently stated that in the 1930s–1940s gay people referred to themselves as ''temperamental''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://progressive.org/mag_cusachay|title=Harry Hay Interview - The Progressive|work=progressive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gay===
{{wiktionary|gay#Etymology_1}}
Although the word was originally synonymous with happy or cheerful, in the 20th century it gradually came to designate someone who is romantically or sexually attracted to someone of the same gender or sex.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

[[File:FAK Volksangbundel00.jpg|thumb]]
'''Theodore Walter Jandrell''' aka '''Theo W. Jandrell''' (19 August 1888 [[Richmond, Northern Cape]] - 1968) was a South African teacher, principal of the [[Volksrust]] Primary School, educationist, inspector of schools, and prolific Afrikaans poet and folksong writer.

Jandrell was a major contributor to the ''FAK Volksangbundel'', a compendium of Afrikaans songs with music first published in 1937. His lyrics drew inspiration from songwriters such as [[Stephen Foster]] and traditional European and American melodies. His ''"Bolandse Nooi'ntjie"'' was based on Foster's ''"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]"''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Bolandse nooi'ntjie, stil is die nag,&lt;br&gt;
''soet is jou rus na die lang, lange dag!&lt;br&gt;
''Saans in my drome kom ek na jou,&lt;br&gt;
''smagtend na lonkies uit oë so blou.&lt;br&gt;
''Berge en dale kan ons nooit skei,&lt;br&gt;
''want in die droomland ontmoet jy vir my."''

[[File:EMPTY STEEL BEER AND SOFT DRINK CANS ARE BEING USED TO BUILD EXPERIMENTAL HOUSING NEAR TAOS, NEW MEXICO. DESIGNER... - NARA - 556618.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Architect [[Mike Reynolds (architect)|Mike Reynolds]] next to a tin can wall in the 1970s]]
A '''tin can wall''' is a [[wall]] constructed from [[tin can]]s, which are not a common building source.  The cans can be laid in [[concrete]], stacked vertically on top of each other, and crushed or cut and flattened to be used as [[roof shingles|shingles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eco-artware.com/newsletter/newsletter_05_04.shtml#can-house]&lt;/ref&gt;  They can also be used for furniture. 

Tin cans can form the actual fill-in structure (or walls) of a building, as is done with [[earthships]].
Tin cans have not been around for a long time, and neither have their building methods. The two main structural methods for building with tin cans are by laying them horizontally in a concrete matrix and by stacking them vertically.

== History ==
Tin can building in New Mexico originated in the early 1980s as a response to the massive amounts of trash being discarded and the wasteful nature of common building practices.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  Tin can construction was an attempt to utilize a readily available resource that was normally sent to [[landfills]] or [[recycling]] centers.  This led to various experiments in tin can building, including space-filler between wooden frames in traditional house styles and creating domes and archways using cans and cement.  Within time, more simplified and practical methods were developed, such as the [[earthship]] tin can wall.  The main person behind these efforts was [[Mike Reynolds (architect)|Mike Reynolds]], also creator of the earthship building method.

== Construction ==
A “traditional” earthship [[tin can]] wall is made by horizontally stacking tin cans in a [[concrete]] matrix. The cans are laid side by side and in alternating rows, similar to [[brick]]s. This is done simply and efficiently, using batches of concrete between the cans.  The consistency of the concrete must be relatively thick, so as to hold its form and the tin cans in place.  A surprisingly large number of cans are required.

The method for stacking the cans involves creating a row of cans separated by hand-formed “lumps” of concrete. The layout of a row is can, concrete, can, etc. This is then repeated, except that the alternating pattern is reversed, so that every can is laid on top of a concrete “lump” below it. This continues until completed, or the weight of the wall and the hardness of the cement seem questionable in terms of solidity. At that point it would be wise to wait for the wall to harden, but the laying time for cans and concrete is such that by the time a builder makes it back to an area that was recently laid it has had time to set. It is a judgment call as to whether or not the builder should continue, but by the next day or even later in the same day building can resume.

==Materials==
The materials that go into a tin can [[wall]] are simple: mainly tin cans and concrete.  Tin cans (now [[aluminum]] cans as real tin cans are not as readily available) can be acquired from any recycling center or a local bar.  Brick [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] may also be used instead of cement.

== Coating ==
Once the wall is completed, the cans and the concrete are covered with a layer of cement or [[adobe]] mud mixture. What is applied depends on the location of the wall; if it is located in an area where it will be exposed to water (such as in a bathroom or utility room) it will need to be coated with a concrete layer. If it is located in a living room or bedroom, it can be covered with adobe [[plaster]]. A tin can wall that has half of its structure outside (such as the wall of an entrance to a building) will be coated with cement on the outside and adobe on the inside. The shape of the cans (their [[Tab (beverage can)|pull-tabs]], etc.) and the roughness of the cement will provide a [[lath]]-like surface for the cement or adobe to stick to.

This initial layer is “screeted” (scratched with a tool that creates a ridge-like pattern thereby making it easier to apply another coat) and a second layer is added. More layers may be added, but it is up to the builder’s judgment and dependent upon the material being applied.  In the case of adobe mud, once the initial layer is applied and allowed to harden it will crack and will need additional coats. With cement fewer layers are needed. The basic rule is: the more coats/layers, the stronger and better-looking the wall will be. This can be overdone however. 

When a tin can wall has been sufficiently coated it will then be “finished” with a fine plaster ([[Lime (mineral)|lime]]-based or other), [[stucco]] (if the wall is outside), or [[linseed oil]] (in the case of adobe). It can also be finished with a clay “slip”, or aliz,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkearth.org/naturalbuilding/aliz.html]&lt;/ref&gt; which is an earth-based coat that can have natural pigment and fine grains of [[mica]] mixed in to produce a beautiful shimmering and organic-looking surface.

== Examples ==
An outside tin can insulating wall is a simple design. It is made out of two tin can walls with a layer of solid [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] in the middle. The insulation can vary in thickness, depending on climate and budget. It can be made out of various [[Green building|“green” or sustainable materials]] or average run-of-the-mill solid insulation. The exposed sides of the tin can walls (those not facing the insulation) are finished using methods aforementioned. The inside part of the wall can be coated with [[adobe]] while the outside is finished with [[concrete]] and [[stucco]]. 

A [[door]] frame can be built into the can wall, or rather the can wall is built around the frame. The process involves initially having a door frame set in place (on the [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]]) and stacking cans to either side of the frame until they reach the other walls of the building and the ceiling. The door frame is fastened to the tin can wall by hammering nails partially into the side of the frame that will touch the tin can wall and allowing the concrete to harden around the nails. Short strips of metal [[lath]] are also attached to the frame and folded out (perpendicular to the frame) and allowed to set in the can/concrete matrix.

The same method is applied to [[window]]s. The only difference is all sides of window are fastened to the tin can wall, while the door frame is fastened to the foundation on one side (bottom) and the can wall on three sides. Metal [[lath]] and nails are all that is needed, along with a [[bubble level]] or similar device. Once the desired height is reached to install a window frame, the wall is [[:wikt:leveled|leveled]]. If any cans stick above the level plane they can be flattened to the desired height. Nails and lath sticking out from under the window frame holds the bottom of it in place, and the sides and top of the frame are fastened in the same fashion as a door frame. 

To make a smooth transition from door (or window frame) to tin can wall with [[plaster]], sheets of metal lath are attached to the rim of the frame and folded over the gap between the frame and the can wall. A double-layered [[wooden]] frame is therefore required, to give a surface for the metal lath to be nailed to while leaving the inside frame untouched. However, this is not necessarily a necessity. 

[[Electrical]] wiring is simple, with the [[Electrical wiring|wires]] attached to the cans or fastened to the concrete before the initial coat. If a wire needs to go to the other side of a wall it can be punched directly through a can. [[Plumbing]] and pipework can use similar methods. The can wall can always be built around a [[pipe (material)|pipe]], or there can be a wooden frame made similar to a window or door to house the pipe.

== Strength and use ==
Tin can walls are not considered [[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]] using this building method, although two-story circular [[dome]] structures have been built. The basic rule is that it can support considerable weight but should not be used to hold up much more than its own form and shape. It would not be wise to attach a heavy [[timber]] roof to a tin can wall without support beams or frames. The basic function for can walls is in-fill (filling in the space between support beams or the main structure) and the division of [[space]]. They work excellent to separate a living room from a bedroom, and are also used as insulating walls from the outside. 

An earthship tin can wall is both an efficient and economical building method. They are mainly composed of [[aluminum]] and [[cement]], and can withstand the test of [[time]]. They are made from few materials (the coating method can be more complex than building the wall itself). They use [[recycled]] materials and require little or no [[skill]] to build.

== Alternative methods ==
The other tin can wall method that will be briefly described is a system developed by a [[Germany|German]] artist named Michael Hönes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.can-products.de/]&lt;/ref&gt;  He has led community rebuilding efforts in [[Lesotho]], [[Africa]] using tin cans to create housing and opportunities for [[Aids orphan]]s and foster mothers. Known as the TCV (a.k.a. Tin-Can Villages) project, Hönes has created buildings using tin cans, [[masonite]], paint, and wire. The roof is made out of [[wikt:corrugated|corrugated]] metal [[roof shingle|shingles]]. In this method the cans are stacked vertically, one on top of the other in rows that are placed side by side and secured with wire. They are left exposed and are arranged in a decorative manner. The structures require no foundation, and are said to be able to withstand the Lesotho [[storms]]. 

A site for the first village in [[Maseru]] has been secured and the funding has been sourced. What is lacking is building permits (as of July 2004). The TCV organization, headed by Hönes, has been prefabricating tin can walls so that when the permits pass about one building a week can be constructed.

So far the TCV organization’s efforts have been concentrated on storehouses, offices, a large weaving workshop for the women of the Elelloang Basali Weavers group in Teyateyaneng, and a solar-powered restaurant&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesotho-tours.de/indexCanHouses.html]&lt;/ref&gt; that cooks with [[solar ovens]]. Michael Hönes also focuses on tin can furniture and has created a [[stove]] out of tin cans that uses one-third less wood than what the poor people of the area commonly use, thereby diminishing the [[firewood]] crisis in [[Lesotho]].

'''Tridib Mitra''' (born 31 December 1940) was one of the pioneers of the [[Hungry generation]] movement in Bengali literature which changed the literary landscape of West Bengal once for all. With his wife Alo Mitra he edited [[Hungry generation]] magazines '''The Waste Paper''' in English and '''Unmarga''' in Bengali. He and his wife were the one who started Poetry Readings in Burning Ghats, Graveyards, Ganges river banks as well as in Country liquor joints of [[Kolkata]]. He was, in fact, one of the cultural game changers during the sixties when Hungry generation literary movement arrived with full force in the Bengali cultural arena. He and his wife were the one who delivered Hungry generation masks of demons, jokers, gods etc. at the offices and houses of Ministers, Administrators, Newspaper Editors and other power holders of the West Bengali Establishment. He was an Anti-Establishment writer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4568">{{short description|specialist term for a work that collates all known variants of a text}}
A '''variorum''', short for ''(editio) cum notis variorum'', is a work that collates all known variants of a text.  It is a work of [[textual criticism]], whereby all variations and emendations are set side by side so that a reader can track how textual decisions have been made in the preparation of a text for publication. The [[Bible]] and the works of [[William Shakespeare]] have often been the subjects of variorum editions, although the same techniques have been applied with less frequency to many other works.

==Etymology==
The word ''variorum'' is Latin for 'of various [persons]' and derives from the phrase ''cum notis variorum'' ('with notes by various people') which was often used in the title-pages of Dutch books of the 17th century.

==Original meaning==
An older meaning of the word refers not to the text itself but to the assortment of illustrative notes printed with it: 'an edition of a text (usually [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]]) which includes annotations by a variety of critics and commentators'.  Variorum editions of this kind were a speciality of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] publishers of the 17th century, including the house of [[Elsevier]].  In these editions the text is usually taken, with little or no attempt at constructive modification, from a single widely accepted critical edition of the period;  the interest lies in the notes, which often fill three-quarters of each page, and which typically embody the complete commentaries of two or three recognised specialists in the work of the author in question, together with selected passages from several other commentators.  The notes will usually include textual variants, both documented and conjectural, together with examples of parallel usages and (for non-fiction texts) historical information.  Usually some middle-ranking literary man was appointed as general editor; occasionally, however, a first-rate scholar would preside over the edition and include original work of his own within it, [[Nicolas Heinsius]]'s edition of [[Claudius Claudianus|Claudian]] (Elsevier, 1661) being a good example.

==Notable variorum editions==
A variorum of the [[Bible]] has been produced at various times in history and of various scopes. Documenting each line of text with {{em|all}} variants in wording, from {{em|all}} known source documents, presented chronologically, helps translators of the Bible establish primacy and prevalence of various line readings.

There have also been noteworthy variorums of the works of [[William Shakespeare]], including the readings of all [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|quartos and folios]]; the textual decisions, or choices, of past editors; and a compilation of all critical notes. The first was that of [[Isaac Reed]] in 1803. Variorum editions help editors and scholars understand the historical evolution of the Shakespeare texts, as well as to decode dubious lines and decide upon most likely authorial intent.

[[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' is typically presented in variorum format, with both the 1781 and 1787 editions printed side-by-side in nearly all modern editions.

[[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' went through six editions with extensive changes. The text became a third larger, with numerous parts rewritten five times.  A variorum&lt;ref&gt;Peckham, Morse, ed. (1959), ''The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Variorum Text'', [[Philadelphia]]: [[University of Pennsylvania Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1959.

There is also a variorum of ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''. [[Walt Whitman]] produced either six or nine editions during his lifetime. The [[New York University Press]] produced a variorum in 1980 of these various editions.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Sculley, Harold W. Blodgett and William White, eds. (1980), ''Leaves of Grass: A Textual Variorum of the Printed Poems, 1855-1891''; 3 vol., (Series: ''The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman''); New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[James Strachey]] translation of [[Freud]]'s ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' in volumes four and five of ''[[The Standard Edition of The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud]]'' collates eight editions.

[[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s works have been collated to produce a voluminous digital variorum. It can be viewed on the [http://bichitra.jdvu.ac.in Bichitra] website.

'''Vesre''' (reversing the order of syllables within a word) is one of the features of [[Rioplatense Spanish]] slang. Natives of [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] use vesre sparingly in colloquial speaking, and never in formal circumstances. [[Tango music|Tango]] lyrics make widespread use of [[lunfardo]] and vesre to highlight the intended [[crime|underworld]] atmosphere, or for comic relief.

Vesre is mostly from [[Buenos Aires]], and other cities in [[Argentina]] have their own customs. [[Rosario]] has its "[[Rosarigasino]]" method for obfuscating words, and [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] has an entirely different set of colloquial conventions. Yet, most Argentines and [[Uruguay]]ans have been exposed to vesre through [[tango]] lyrics or the media.

Even though vesre has spread to other countries, and can be heard in [[Peru]], [[Chile]] and [[Ecuador]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speakers outside the [[Río de la Plata]] area are usually less inclined to use it. Popular speech has created some instances; for example, natives of [[Barranquilla]], [[Colombia]] often call their city ''Curramba'', in a stylized form of vesre.

==Examples==
{{example farm|date=May 2018}}
NOTE: When the syllables of the noun are switched, the original gender - masculine or feminine - is kept; e.g., "un café -&gt; un feca"
*revés → vesre (reverse; backwards). "verre" is much more commonly used in Argentina, as in: "Nosotros hablamos al vesre, ¿viste? ("We speak wardbacks, see?")
*café → feca (coffee) e.g., "¿Querés un feca?" (Would you like some coffee?")
*caballo → llobaca (horse)
*leche → chele (milk)
*libro → broli (book) e.g., (usually plural) "¡Che, agarrá los brolis más seguido!" (Dude, get the books and learn something!)
*amigo → gomía (friend) e.g., "¡Eh!, ¡¿qué hacés gomía?!" (Hey! How goes it, my friend?!)
*doctor → tordo (doctor, usually meaning ''physician'' but also used for lawyers. ''"Tordo"'' is also the name in Argentina of the opportunistic [[shiny cowbird]]).
*carne → nerca (meat)
*pizza → zapi ("Zapi" even became the name of a pizza chain)
*baño → ñoba (bathroom) e.g., "Ahora vengo, voy al ñoba un toque" (BRB, gotta go to the john real quick)
*boludo → dolobu or dobolu (dumb, moron, silly, fool), e.g., "Dale, no te hagás el dolobu" (Yeah right! Don't play the fool here – like you don’t know that)
*mujer → jermu (woman; the vesre version mostly means "wife") e.g., "¡Guarda que ahí viene tu jermu!" (Watch out, here comes your woman)
*pelado → dolape (bald person)
*calle → lleca (street)
*perro → rope (dog)
*gato → toga (cat) "Toga" most likely refers to a female prostitute
*piña → ñapi (a blow with a fist - usually aimed at the face or stomach)
*panza → zapán (a pot/beer belly; protruding stomach - said of a male)
*japonés → ponja (Japanese person)
*patrón → trompa (male boss or supervisor)
*pedo → dope (literally "fart", but used in the expression "estar al dope" = to be sitting around, wasting time)
*barrio → rioba (neighborhood; the "hood")
*pelotas → talopes (literally "balls" meaning "testicles"; used in the expression "¡Las talopes!" = No way; It ain't gonna happen!), though "tarlipes" (vesre for ''perlitas'', literally little pearls) is used more often
*cabeza → zabeca (someone's head)

Occasionally, vesre is a stepping-stone towards further obfuscation, achieved by evolving into a longer word. For example:

*coche (car) → checo → checonato (after a once-famous sportsman named Cecconatto)
*cinco (the number five) → cocín → cocinero (literally ''cook''; used mostly on the [[race track|racetrack]] to mean "the five horse")

The original and ''vesre'' versions of a word are not always [[synonym]]s; sometimes the reversal adds some extra nuance to the meaning. For instance, the word ''hotel'' bears the same meaning as in English (i.e. a normal tourist hotel), whereas ''telo'' implies that the establishment is actually a [[love hotel]].

These reversed words are only spoken; rarely found in writing.

==In other languages==
In English - [[Pig Latin]]; (Not exactly with the same morphological construction but similar in purpose and tone) 

Colloquial [[French language|French]] has a form of intentional metathesis known as [[verlan]].

[[Greek language|Greek]] has [[Podaná]] with the same morphological construction.

[[Tagalog language|Tagálog]], a language of the [[Philippines]], also has a similar construct known as ''binaliktad'', lit. "inverted."

[[Serbian language|Serbian]] has a form of slang called [[Šatrovački]] followed in the 1990s with a more ambiguous slang called [[Šatrovački|utrovački]].
