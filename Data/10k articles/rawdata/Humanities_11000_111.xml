'''Andres Serrano''' (born August 15, 1950) is an American [[photographer]] and artist who has become famous through his photos of corpses and his use of feces and bodily fluids in his work, notably his controversial work ''[[Piss Christ]]'', a red-tinged photograph of a [[crucifix]] submerged in a glass container of what was purported to be the artist's own [[urine]]. He is also notable for creating the artwork for the heavy metal band [[Metallica]]'s ''[[Load (album)|Load]]'' and ''[[Reload (Metallica album)|Reload]]'' albums.

==Early life==
Serrano was born in [[New York City]] on August 15, 1950.&lt;ref name=contempphotog&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=executive editor: Martin Marix|title=Contemporary photographers|year=1995|publisher=St. James Press|location=Detroit|isbn=1558621903|pages=1013–1015|edition=3rd }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is from a half [[Honduras|Honduran]], half [[Afro-Cuban]] background, and was raised a strict Roman Catholic. He studied from 1967 to 1969 at the [[Brooklyn Museum|Brooklyn Museum and Art School]],&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogallery.com/Serrano_Andres/Andres_Serrano-Biography.html |title=Andres Serrano – Biography |work=Rogallery.com |accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet is considered to be a self-taught photographer. In December 1980, he married artist [[Julie Ault]].&lt;ref name=contempphotog /&gt; In a 2012 interview, Serrano references Ault as his "first wife" and Irina Movmyga as his current wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the photographer: Andres Serrano |url=http://museemagazine.com/art-2/features/interview-with-andres-serrano/ |work=Musee |accessdate=November 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109081731/http://museemagazine.com/art-2/features/interview-with-andres-serrano/ |archivedate=January 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Serrano has said that he is a [[Christian]].&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4w383g/serrano-shoots-cuba-full-length|title=Serano Shoots Cuba|work=Vice.com|accessdate= January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Andres Serrano cropped.jpg|left|thumb|Serrano in 2010 at [[Michael Musto]]'s ''[[Village Voice]]'' 25th Anniversary party]]
He worked as an assistant art director at an advertising firm, before creating his first works in 1983.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;

His work has been exhibited in diverse locations around the world including the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine]] in New York City, ''World without end (2001)'', and a retrospective at the [[Barbican Arts Centre]] in London, ''Body and soul (2001)''.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;

His exhibitions have often inspired angry reactions. On October 5, 2007, his group of photographs called ''The History of Sex'' were on display and several were vandalized at an art gallery in [[Lund]], Sweden by people who were believed to be part of a [[neo-Nazi]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/09/arts/design/09serr.html |title=Gallery Vandals Destroy Photos |author=Carol Vogel |date=October 9, 2007 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 16, 2011, after two weeks of protests and a campaign of [[hate mail]] and abusive phone calls to an art gallery displaying his work, orchestrated by groups of [[French Catholicism|French Catholic]] fundamentalists, approximately a thousand people marched through the streets of [[Avignon]], to protest outside the gallery. On April 17, 2011, two of his works, ''Piss Christ'' and ''The Church'', were vandalized. The gallery director plans to reopen the museum with the damaged works on show "so people can see what barbarians can do".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/18/andres-serrano-piss-christ-destroyed-christian-protesters |title=Attack on 'blasphemous' art work fires debate on role of religion in France |author=Angelique Chrisafis |date=April 18, 2011 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Serrano usually makes large prints of about {{convert|20|by|30|in|cm}}. He has shot an array of subject matter including portraits of [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansmen]], morgue photos, and pictures of burn victims. He went into the [[New York City Subway]] with lights and photographic background paper to portray the bedraggled homeless, as well as producing some rather tender but sometimes decidedly kinky portraits of couples. One of these last shows what Adrian Searle of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described as "a young couple, she with a strap-on dildo, he with a mildly expectant expression."&lt;ref name="negener"&gt;Searle, Adrian. [https://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,1169,728550,00.html Negative energy], ''[[The Guardian]]'', October 13, 2001. Retrieved February 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:'Madonna and Child II', Cibachrome print by Andres Serrano, 1989, Corcoran Gallery of Art (Washington, D. C.).jpg|thumb|right|''Madonna and Child II'', [[Ilfochrome|Cibachrome print]] by Andres Serrano, 1989, [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] (Washington, D. C.)]]
Many of Serrano's pictures involve bodily fluids in some way—depicting, for example, blood (sometimes [[menstrual cycle|menstrual]] blood), [[semen]] (for example, ''Blood and Semen II'' (1990)) or human female milk. Within this series are a number of works in which objects are submerged in bodily fluids. Most famous of these is ''[[Piss Christ]]'' (1987), a photograph of a plastic crucifix submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. This caused great controversy when first exhibited. The work was sold for $277,000 in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5070403 Auction Results: Andres Serrano's ''Piss Christ'']&lt;/ref&gt; which was far beyond the estimated $20,000 – $30,000. Serrano, alongside other artists such as [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[Barbara Degenevieve|Barbara DeGenevieve]], and [[Merry Alpern]],  became a figure whom [[Senator Jesse Helms]], and [[Alphonse D'Amato|Senator Alfonse D'Amato]], as well as other cultural conservatives, attacked for producing offensive art while others, including ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/08/arts/review-art-andres-serrano-provocation-and-spirituality.html|title=Andres Serrano: Provocation And Spirituality|last=Brenson|first=Michael|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=December 8, 1989|accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; defended him in the name of [[freedom of speech|artistic freedom]]. (See the American "[[culture war]]s" of the 1990s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/03/arts/endowment-ends-program-helping-individual-artists.html|title=Endowment Ends Program Helping Individual Artists|last=Schemo|first=Diana Jean|date=November 3, 1994|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serrano's series ''Objects of Desire'', from the early 1990s, features close-ups of firearms, photographed at the [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]], Louisiana home of artist [[Blake Nelson Boyd]]. Included is a shot, against a glowing orange background, down the barrel of a loaded .45 [[revolver]] (belonging to Boyd's grandfather) that was used by Jonas Mekas for the cover of the April–May–June 2007 Anthology Film Archives catalog.

Critical reception of Serrano's work has been mixed. In a 1989 ''New York Times'' review, critic Michael Brenson responded to Serrano's series of [[Cibachrome]] photographs of iconic objects submerged in bodily fluids: "You cannot consider the content of Mr. Serrano's work without considering his attitude toward photography. It is the photograph that breaks through convention, that makes the search possible and that enables the artist to sort out what he likes and does not like in religion and art. It is the photograph that becomes the vessel of transformation and revelation. The photograph then becomes an icon that, for Mr. Serrano, replaces the false icons in his work. The photograph is clean and purified, the reliquary or shrine in which he clearly believes that the word about the body can be stored and spread."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brenson|first=Michael|title=Andres Serrano: Provocation And Spirituality|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/08/arts/review-art-andres-serrano-provocation-and-spirituality.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing later work in 2001, ''Guardian'' art critic Adrian Searle was not impressed: he found that Serrano's photos were "far more about being lurid than anything else... In the end, the show is all surface, and looking for hidden depths does no good."&lt;ref name="negener" /&gt; Continuing his use of biological matter, more recent work of Serrano's uses feces as a medium.&lt;ref&gt;Yaeger, Lynn. [http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-08-27/columns/serrano-s-shit-show/ "Andres Serrano's 'Shit' Show"], ''Village Voice'', August 26, 2008. Accessed September 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Serrano's work ''Blood and Semen III'' is used as the cover of heavy metal band [[Metallica]]'s album ''[[Load (album)|Load]]'', while "Piss and Blood" is used on ''[[Reload (Metallica album)|Reload]]''. Serrano also directed a video for [[industrial metal]] group [[Godflesh]], "[[Crush My Soul]]".

In 2008, Serrano's piece ''The Interpretation of Dreams (White Nigger)'' was selected to participate in [[Renaissance Society|The Renaissance Society]]'s group exhibit, "Black Is, Black Ain't".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renaissancesociety.org/site/Exhibitions/Images.Black-Is-Black-Ain-t.595.5158.html Renaissance Society] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120910032932/http://www.renaissancesociety.org/site/Exhibitions/Images.Black-Is-Black-Ain-t.595.5158.html |date=September 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serrano adopted the [[alter ego]] "Brutus Faust" to create the full-length album ''Vengeance Is Mine'' in July 2010. The album contains covers of classic songs from the 1960s, and original compositions including four songs written by Serrano’s wife Irina Movmyga as well as one song co-written by Serrano, Thad DeBrock, and [[album producer]] Steve Messina of New York City–based band [[Blow Up Hollywood]]. Coinciding with the release of the album are the videos ''Goo Goo Gaga'', ''Love Letters'', and ''Bad Moon Rising''. ''Goo Goo Gaga'' consists mostly of black-and-white footage from the 1940s, which makes parallels between the Depression and the present day, with the images of "Brutus" shot by Francesco Carrozzini. ''Love Letters'' is footage taken from cult director Joe Sarno’s ''Flesh and Lace''. ''Bad Moon Rising'' consists entirely of footage Serrano compiled from several short films by John Santerineross. All of these short films were edited by Vincent V.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brutusfaust.com/about.php Brutus Faust.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/106955/andres-serrano-wants-to-be-a-rock-star|title=Andres Serrano Wants to Be a Rock Star|last=Laster|first=Paul|publisher=flavorwire|date=July 22, 2010|accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Serrano made a work of art called ''Sign of the Times'' by collecting 200 signs from homeless people in New York City, usually paying $20 for each sign. He described the work as "a testimony to the homeless men and women who roam the streets in search of food and shelter. It's also a chronicle of the times we live in."&lt;ref&gt;Serrano, Andres.[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/18/andres-serrano-signs-of-the-times-homeless I started buying the signs that homeless use to beg. Here's what happened], ''[[The Guardian]]'', December 21, 2013. Retrieved December 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of several months, Serrano engaged with over 85 homeless individuals in Manhattan and photographed them for a series called ''Residents of New York'', a site-specific [[public art]] exhibition on display from May 19 to June 15, 2014 at the [[West Fourth Street – Washington Square (New York City Subway)|West Fourth Street – Washington Square]] subway station, on [[LaGuardia Place]] (between West [[3rd Street (Manhattan)|3rd]] and [[Bleecker Street]]s), at [[Judson Memorial Church]], and in phone booths and posters around the city.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Katherine.

Retrieved May 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Serrano initially photographed homeless individuals in New York in 1990 for a series of studio-style portraits titled ''Nomads''. In ''Residents of New York'', he removed his signature studio elements, focusing instead on personal connectivity and interaction directly on the streets of New York City, where the homeless live.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Benjamin.

'''Appalachia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|p|ə|ˈ|l|æ|tʃ|ə|,_|-|ˈ|l|eɪ|tʃ|ə}}) is a [[cultural region]] in the [[Eastern United States]] that stretches from the [[Southern Tier]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] to northern [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name=arc1&gt;{{cite web

As of the [[2010 United States Census]], the region was home to approximately 25 million people.&lt;ref name=arc2&gt;{{cite web

Since its recognition as a distinctive region in the late 19th century, Appalachia has been a source of [[Appalachian stereotypes|enduring myths and distortions]] regarding the isolation, temperament, and behavior of its inhabitants. Early 20th century writers often engaged in [[yellow journalism]] focused on [[Sensationalism|sensationalistic]] aspects of the region's culture, such as [[moonshining]] and [[Appalachia#Feuds|clan feuding]], and often portrayed the region's inhabitants as uneducated and prone to impulsive acts of violence. Sociological studies in the 1960s and 1970s helped to re-examine and dispel these [[stereotype]]s.&lt;ref name=abramson1&gt;Abramson, Rudy. Introduction to ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. xix–xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

While endowed with abundant natural resources, Appalachia has long struggled and been associated with [[poverty]]. In the early 20th century, large-scale [[logging]] and [[coal mining]] firms brought wage-paying jobs and modern amenities to Appalachia, but by the 1960s the region had failed to capitalize on any long-term benefits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sokol |first=Anna |title=Economic Redevelopment in Appalachia: The Appalachian Regional Commission |url=http://www.umich.edu/~econdev/arc/ |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from these two industries. Beginning in the 1930s, the federal government sought to alleviate poverty in the Appalachian region with a series of [[New Deal]] initiatives, such as the construction of [[dam]]s to provide cheap electricity and the implementation of better farming practices. On March 9, 1965, the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.irp.wisc.edu/newsevents/workshops/2011/participants/papers/12-Ziliak.pdf |title=The Appalachian Regional Development Act and Economic Change |last=Ziliak |first=James P. |date=September 16, 2010 |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created to further alleviate poverty in the region, mainly by diversifying the region's economy and helping to provide better health care and educational opportunities to the region's inhabitants. By 1990, Appalachia had largely joined the economic mainstream, but still lagged behind the rest of the nation in most economic indicators.&lt;ref name=abramson1/&gt;

Since Appalachia lacks definite physiographical or topographical boundaries, there has been some disagreement over what exactly the region encompasses. The most commonly used modern definition of Appalachia is the one initially defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission in 1965 and expanded over subsequent decades.&lt;ref name=abramson1 /&gt; The region defined by the Commission currently includes 420 counties and eight [[Independent city (United States)#Virginia|independent cities]] in 13 states, including all of [[West Virginia]], 14 counties in [[New York (state)|New York]], 52 in [[Pennsylvania]], 32 in [[Ohio]], 3 in [[Maryland]], 54 in [[Kentucky]], 25 counties and 8 [[Administrative divisions of Virginia#Independent cities|cities]] in [[Virginia]],&lt;ref&gt;In Virginia, all municipalities incorporated as "cities" are legally separate from counties.&lt;/ref&gt; 29 in [[North Carolina]], 52 in [[Tennessee]], 6 in [[South Carolina]], 37 in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 37 in [[Alabama]], and 24 in [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=arc1 /&gt; When the Commission was established, counties were added based on economic need, however, rather than any cultural parameters.&lt;ref name=abramson1 /&gt;

The first major attempt to map Appalachia as a distinctive cultural region came in the 1890s with the efforts of [[Berea College]] president William Goodell Frost, whose "Appalachian America" included 194 counties in 8 states.&lt;ref name=williams&gt;John Alexander Williams, ''Appalachia: A History'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11–14}} In 1921, John C. Campbell published ''The Southern Highlander and His Homeland'' in which he modified Frost's map to include 254 counties in 9 states. A landmark survey of the region in the following decade by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] defined the region as consisting of 206 counties in 6 states. In 1984, Karl Raitz and Richard Ulack expanded the ARC's definition to include 445 counties in 13 states, although they removed all counties in Mississippi and added two in [[New Jersey]]. Historian John Alexander Williams, in his 2002 book ''Appalachia: A History'', distinguished between a "core" Appalachian region consisting of 164 counties in West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia, and a greater region defined by the ARC.&lt;ref name=abramson1 /&gt; In the ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (2006), [[Appalachian State University]] historian [[Howard Dorgan]] suggested the term "Old Appalachia" for the region's cultural boundaries, noting an academic tendency to ignore the southwestern and northeastern extremes of the ARC's pragmatic definition.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Rudy, and Jean Haskell, eds., ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1287–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology and pronunciation===
[[File:Gutierrez-1562-detail-app1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Detail of Gutierrez' 1562 map showing the first known cartographic appearance of a variant of the name "Appalachia"]]

While exploring inland along the northern coast of [[Florida]] in 1528, the members of the [[Narváez expedition]], including [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]], found a [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] village near present-day [[Tallahassee, Florida]], whose name they transcribed as ''Apalchen'' or ''Apalachen'' ({{IPA-all|apaˈlatʃen}}). The name was soon altered by the Spanish to [[Apalachee]] and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north. [[Pánfilo de Narváez]]'s expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528, and applied the name. Now spelled "Appalachian", it is the fourth oldest surviving European place-name in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;After Florida, [[Dry Tortugas]] and [[Cape Canaveral]]: {{cite book |title=Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |last= Stewart |first=George |authorlink=George R. Stewart |year=1945 |publisher= Random House |location=New York |pages= 11–13, 17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Hernando de Soto|de Soto expedition]] in 1540, Spanish cartographers began to apply the name of the tribe to the mountains themselves. The first cartographic appearance of ''Apalchen'' is on [[Diego Gutiérrez (cartographer)|Diego Gutiérrez']] map of 1562; the first use for the mountain range is the map of [[Jacques le Moyne de Morgues]] in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;Walls, David (1977), "On the Naming of Appalachia," In ''An Appalachian Symposium'', pp. 56–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Le Moyne was also the first European to apply "Apalachen" specifically to a mountain range as opposed to a village, native tribe, or a southeastern region of North America.&lt;ref&gt;Blaustein, Richard (2003), ''The Thistle and the Brier: Historical Links and Cultural Parallels Between Scotland and Appalachia'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name was not commonly used for the whole mountain range until the late 19th century. A competing and often more popular name was the "[[Allegheny Mountains]]", "Alleghenies", and even "Alleghania." In the early 19th century, [[Washington Irving]] proposed renaming the United States either "Appalachia" or "Alleghania".&lt;ref&gt;[[George R. Stewart|Stewart, George R.]] (1967). ''Names on the Land''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

In northern U.S. dialects, the mountains are pronounced {{IPAc-en|æ|p|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|tʃ|ən|z}} or {{IPAc-en|æ|p|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|ʃ|ən|z}}. The cultural region of Appalachia is pronounced {{IPA|/æpəˈleɪʃ(i)ə/}}, also {{IPA|/æpəˈleɪtʃ(i)ə/}}, all with a third syllable like "lay". In southern U.S. dialects, the mountains are called the {{IPAc-en|æ|p|ə|ˈ|l|æ|tʃ|ən|z}}, and the cultural region of Appalachia is pronounced {{IPA|/ˈæpəˈlætʃ(i)ə/}}, both with a third syllable like the "la" in "latch".&lt;ref&gt;Walls, David (2006). "Appalachia." ''The Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press), pp. 1006–07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged'' (Springfield, Mass.: Merriam-Webster, 1993), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; This pronunciation is favored in the "core" region in central and southern parts of the Appalachian range. The occasional use of the "sh" sound for the "ch" in the last syllable in northern dialects was popularized by [[Appalachian Trail]] organizations in [[New England]] in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;{{rp|11–14}}

==History==

===Early history===
Native American hunter-gatherers first arrived in what is now Appalachia over 16,000 years ago. The earliest discovered site is the [[Meadowcroft Rockshelter]] in [[Washington County, Pennsylvania]], which some scientists claim is pre-[[Clovis culture]]. Several other [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (8000–1000 BC) archaeological sites have been identified in the region, such as the [[St. Albans, West Virginia|St. Albans]] site in West Virginia and the [[Icehouse Bottom]] site in Tennessee. In the 16th century, the de Soto and [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] expeditions explored the mountains of South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia, and encountered complex agrarian societies consisting of [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking]] inhabitants. De Soto indicated that much of the region west of the mountains was part of the domain of [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]], a [[paramount chief]]dom centered around a village complex in northern Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Charles. ''The Juan Pardo Expeditions: Explorations of the Carolinas and Tennessee, 1566–1568'' (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2005), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time English explorers arrived in Appalachia in the late 17th century, the central part of the region was controlled by [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes (namely the [[Shawnee]]) and the southern part of the region was controlled by the [[Cherokee]]. The [[New France|French]] based in modern-day [[Quebec]] also made inroads into the northern areas of the region in modern-day New York state and Pennsylvania. By the mid 18th century the French had outposts such as [[Fort Duquesne]] and [[Fort Le Boeuf]] controlling the access points of the [[Allegheny River]] valley and upper [[Ohio valley]] after exploration by [[Celeron de Bienville]].

[[File:George Caleb Bingham - Daniel Boone escorting settlers through the Cumberland Gap.jpg|thumb|''Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers through the [[Cumberland Gap]]'' ([[George Caleb Bingham]], oil on canvas, 1851–52)]]

European migration into Appalachia began in the 18th century. As lands in eastern Pennsylvania, the [[Tidewater region of Virginia]] and [[the Carolinas]] filled up, immigrants began pushing further and further westward into the Appalachian Mountains. A relatively large proportion of the early [[backcountry]] immigrants were [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]]—later known as "[[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]]"— who were seeking cheaper land and freedom from [[Quakers|Quaker]] leaders, many of whom considered the Scotch-Irish "savages". Others included [[Germans]] from the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] region and English settlers from the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] country. Between 1730 and 1763, immigrants trickled into [[western Pennsylvania]], the [[Shenandoah Valley]] area of Virginia, and [[western Maryland]]. [[Thomas Walker (explorer)|Thomas Walker's]] discovery of [[Cumberland Gap]] in 1750 and the end of the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763 lured settlers deeper into the mountains, namely to upper [[east Tennessee]], northwestern North Carolina, [[upstate South Carolina]], and central Kentucky. Between 1790 and 1840, a series of treaties with the Cherokee and other Native American tribes opened up lands in [[north Georgia (U.S. state)|north Georgia]], [[north Alabama]], the [[Tennessee Valley]], the [[Cumberland Plateau]] regions, and the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] along what is now the Tennessee-North Carolina border.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;{{rp|30–44}} The last of these treaties culminated in the removal of the bulk of the Cherokee population (as well as [[Choctaw]], [[Chickasaw]] and others) from the region via the [[Trail of Tears]] from 1831 until 1838.

===The Appalachian frontier===
[[File:Earnest-fort-house-tn1.jpg|thumb|225px|right|The Earnest Fort-house in [[Greene County, Tennessee]]. Built around 1782 during the [[Cherokee–American wars]], it is located just south of [[Chuckey, Tennessee|Chuckey]] on the banks of the [[Nolichucky River]].]]

Appalachian frontiersmen have long been romanticized for their ruggedness and self-sufficiency. A typical depiction of an Appalachian pioneer involves a hunter wearing a [[coonskin cap]] and [[buckskins|buckskin clothing]], and sporting a long rifle and shoulder-strapped [[powder horn]]. Perhaps no single figure symbolizes the Appalachian pioneer more than [[Daniel Boone]] (1734–1820), a [[long hunter]] and [[surveying|surveyor]] instrumental in the early settlement of Kentucky and Tennessee. Like Boone, Appalachian pioneers moved into areas largely separated from "civilization" by high mountain ridges, and had to fend for themselves against the elements. As many of these early settlers were living on Native American lands, attacks from Native American tribes were a continuous threat until the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Caudill&gt;Caudill, Harry. ''Night Comes to the Cumberlands''&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–13, 19}}

As early as the 18th century, Appalachia (then known simply as the "backcountry") began to distinguish itself from its wealthier lowland and coastal neighbors to the east. Frontiersmen often bickered with lowland and [[tidewater region|tidewater]] "elites" over taxes, sometimes to the point of armed revolts such as the [[War of the Regulation|Regulator Movement]] (1767–1771) in North Carolina.&lt;ref name=drake&gt;Drake, Richard. ''A History of Appalachia'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59–69}} In 1778, at the height of the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]], backwoodsmen from Pennsylvania, Virginia, and what is now Kentucky took part in [[George Rogers Clark]]'s [[Illinois campaign]]. Two years later, a group of Appalachian frontiersmen known as the [[Overmountain Men]] routed British forces at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] after rejecting a call by the British to disarm.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;{{rp|64–68}} After the war, residents throughout the Appalachian backcountry—especially the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] region in western Pennsylvania, and [[antebellum South|antebellum]] northwestern Virginia (now the north-central part of West Virginia) — refused to pay a tax placed on whiskey by the new American government, leading to what became known as the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;{{rp|118–19}} The resulting tighter Federal controls in the Monongahela valley resulted in many whiskey/bourbon makers migrating via the Ohio River to Kentucky and Tennessee where the industry could flourish.

===Early 19th century===
In the early 19th century, the rift between the [[yeoman]] farmers of Appalachia and their wealthier lowland counterparts continued to grow, especially as the latter dominated most state legislatures. People in Appalachia began to feel slighted over what they considered unfair taxation methods and lack of state funding for improvements (especially for roads). In the northern half of the region, the lowland "elites" consisted largely of industrial and business interests, whereas in the parts of the region south of the [[Mason–Dixon line]], the lowland elites consisted of large-scale land-owning [[plantations in the American South|planters]].&lt;ref name=drake/&gt;{{rp|59–69}} The [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], formed in the 1830s, drew widespread support from disaffected Appalachians.

Tensions between the mountain counties and state governments sometimes reached the point of mountain counties threatening to break off and form separate states. In 1832, bickering between western Virginia and eastern Virginia over the state's constitution led to calls on both sides for the state's separation into two states.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;{{rp|141}} In 1841, Tennessee state senator (and later U.S. president) [[Andrew Johnson]] introduced legislation in the [[Tennessee Senate]] calling for the creation of a separate state in East Tennessee. The proposed state would have been known as "Frankland" and would have invited like-minded mountain counties in Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama to join it.&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, Eric. ''Vanquished Volunteers: East Tennessee Sectionalism from Statehood to Secession'' (Johnson City: East Tennessee State University Press, 1965), pp. 122–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The U.S. Civil War===
[[File:1860-61 Secession in Appalachia by County.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Map of the county secession votes of 1860–1861 in Appalachia within the ARC definition. Virginia and Tennessee show the public votes, while the other states show the vote by county delegates to the conventions.]]
By 1860, the Whig Party had disintegrated. Sentiments in northern Appalachia had shifted to the pro-[[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In southern Appalachia, abolitionists still constituted a radical minority, although several smaller opposition parties (most of which were both pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and pro-slavery) were formed to oppose the planter-dominated [[Southern Democrats]]. As states in the southern United States moved toward [[secession]], a majority of Southern Appalachians still supported the Union.&lt;ref name=mckinney1&gt;Gordon McKinney, "The Civil War." ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1579–81.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, a [[Minnesota]] newspaper identified 161 counties in Southern Appalachia—which the paper called "Alleghenia"—where Union support remained strong, and which might provide crucial support for the defeat of the Confederacy.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;{{rp|11–14}} However, many of these Unionists—especially in the mountain areas of North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama—were "conditional" Unionists in that they opposed secession, but also opposed violence to prevent secession, and thus when their respective state legislatures voted to secede, their support shifted to the Confederacy.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;{{rp|160–65}} Kentucky sought to remain neutral at the outset of the conflict, opting not to supply troops to either side. After Virginia voted to secede, several mountain counties in northwestern Virginia rejected the ordinance and with the help of the [[Union Army]] established a separate state, admitted to the Union as West Virginia in 1863. However, half the counties included in the new state, comprising two-thirds of its territory, were secessionist and pro-Confederate.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Richard O. ''A House Divided, Statehood Politics &amp; the Copperhead Movement in West Virginia'', Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1964, pgs. 141–147. Twenty-four of the most mountainous counties of West Virginia had voted for the Secession Ordinance on May 23, 1861.&lt;/ref&gt;

This caused great difficulty for the new Unionist state government in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], both during and after the war.&lt;ref&gt;"Most of West Virginia went through the Civil War not as an asset to the Union but as a troublesome battleground, while the Unionist Ohio River counties struggled to cope with the tide of refugees fleeing to their sanctuary from the interior." Weigley, Russell F. ''A Great Civil War'', W.W. Norton, 2003, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; [[East Tennessee Convention|A similar effort]] occurred in East Tennessee, but the initiative failed after Tennessee's governor ordered the [[Confederate Army]] to occupy the region, forcing East Tennessee's Unionists to flee to the north or go into hiding.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;{{rp|160–65}} The one exception was the so-called [[State of Scott|Free and Independent State of Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1180 | first1=Margaret D. |last1=Binnicker |title=Scott County | work=Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture Encyclopedia | publisher=Tennesseeencyclopedia.net |date= |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both central and southern Appalachia suffered tremendous violence and turmoil during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. While there were two major theaters of operation in the region—namely the [[Shenandoah Valley]] of Virginia (and present-day West Virginia) and the [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] area along the Tennessee-Georgia border—much of the violence was caused by [[bushwhacker]]s and [[guerrilla war]]. The northernmost battles of the entire war were fought in Appalachia with the [[Battle of Buffington Island]] and the [[Battle of Salineville]] resulting from [[Morgan's Raid]]. Large numbers of livestock were killed (grazing was an important part of Appalachia's economy), and numerous farms were destroyed, pillaged, or neglected.&lt;ref name=mckinney1 /&gt; The actions of both Union and Confederate armies left many inhabitants in the region resentful of government authority and suspicious of outsiders for decades after the war.&lt;ref name=drake/&gt;{{rp|109–23}} &lt;ref name=Caudill/&gt;{{rp|39–45}}

===Late 19th and early 20th centuries===

====Economic boom====
[[File:West-virginia-mine-entrance1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Entrance to mine shaft in West Virginia, photographed by [[Lewis Wickes Hine]] in 1908]]

After the war, northern parts of Appalachia experienced an economic boom, while economies in the southern parts of the region stagnated, especially as Southern Democrats regained control of their respective state legislatures at the end of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].&lt;ref name=mckinney1 /&gt; [[Pittsburgh]] as well as [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] grew into major industrial centers, especially regarding iron and steel production. By 1900, the Chattanooga area and north Georgia and northern Alabama had experienced similar changes due to manufacturing booms in [[Atlanta]] and [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] at the edge of the Appalachian region. Railroad construction between the 1880s and early 20th century gave the greater nation access to the vast coalfields in central Appalachia, making the [[Appalachian Land Ownership Survey|economy]] in that part of the region practically synonymous with coal mining. As the nationwide demand for lumber skyrocketed, lumber firms turned to the virgin forests of southern Appalachia, using sawmill and logging railroad innovations to reach remote timber stands. The [[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]] area of Tennessee and Virginia and the [[Kanawha Valley]] of West Virginia became major [[petrochemical]] production centers.&lt;ref name=drake/&gt;{{rp|131–141}}

====Stereotypes====
{{main|Appalachian stereotypes}}
The late 19th and early 20th centuries also saw the development of various regional stereotypes. Attempts by President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] to enforce the whiskey tax in the late 1870s led to an explosion in violence between Appalachian "[[moonshine]]rs" and federal "revenuers" that lasted through the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] period in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;{{rp|187–193}} The breakdown of authority and law enforcement during the Civil War may have contributed to an increase in clan feuding, which by the 1880s was reported to be a problem across most of Kentucky's Cumberland region as well as [[Carter County, Tennessee|Carter County]] in Tennessee, [[Carroll County, Virginia|Carroll County]] in Virginia, and [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo]] and [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan]] counties in West Virginia.&lt;ref name=drake/&gt;{{rp|109–23}} &lt;ref name=williams/&gt;{{rp|187–93}} Regional writers from this period such as [[Mary Noailles Murfree]] and [[Horace Kephart]] liked to focus on such sensational aspects of mountain culture, leading readers outside the region to believe they were more widespread than in reality. In an 1899 article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[Berea College]] president William G. Frost attempted to redefine the inhabitants of Appalachia as "noble mountaineers"—relics of the nation's pioneer period whose isolation had left them unaffected by modern times.&lt;ref name=drake/&gt;{{rp|109–23}}

Today, residents of Appalachia are viewed by many Americans as uneducated and unrefined, resulting in culture-based stereotyping and [[discrimination]] in many areas, including employment and housing. Such discrimination has prompted some to seek redress under prevailing federal and state [[civil rights]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see Walker, Matthew H. "Discrimination Based on National Origin and Ancestry: How the Goals of Equality Have Failed to Address the Pervasive Stereotyping of the Appalachian Tradition", 38 ''U. Dayton L. Rev.'' 335 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Feuds====
Appalachia, and especially Kentucky, became nationally known for its violent [[feud]]s, especially in the remote mountain districts. They pitted the men in extended clans against each other for decades, often using assassination and arson as weapons, along with [[ambush]]es, [[gunfight]]s, and pre-arranged [[shootout]]s. The infamous [[Hatfield–McCoy feud|Hatfield-McCoy Feud]] of the 19th century was the best known of these family feuds. Some of the feuds were continuations of violent local Civil War episodes.&lt;ref&gt;Otterbein, Keith F. "Five Feuds: An Analysis of Homicides in Eastern Kentucky in the Late Nineteenth Century," ''American Anthropologist'', June 2000, Vol. 102 Issue 2, pp 231–43, provides a theoretical analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists often wrote about the violence, using stereotypes that "city folks" had developed about Appalachia; they interpreted the feuds as the natural products of profound ignorance, poverty, and isolation, and perhaps even [[inbreeding]]. In reality, the leading participants were typically well-to-do local elites with networks of clients who were fighting for local political power.&lt;ref&gt;Billings, Dwight B., and [[Kathleen M. Blee]], "'Where the Sun Set Crimson and the Moon Rose Red': Writing Appalachia and the Kentucky Mountain Feuds," ''Southern Cultures'', Summer 1996, Vol. 2 Issue 3/4, pp 329–352&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Appalachia===
Logging firms' rapid devastation of the forests of the Appalachians sparked a movement among [[conservation movement|conservationists]] to preserve what remained and allow the land to "heal". In 1911, Congress passed the [[Weeks Act]], giving the federal government authority to create [[United States National Forest|national forests]] east of the Mississippi River and control timber harvesting. Regional writers and business interests led a movement to create national parks in the eastern United States similar to [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]] and [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] in the west, culminating in the creation of the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] in Tennessee and North Carolina, [[Shenandoah National Park]] in Virginia, [[Cumberland Gap National Historical Park]] in Kentucky,  Virginia and Tennessee, and the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] (connecting the two) in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=drake/&gt;{{rp|200–210}} During the same period, New England forester [[Benton MacKaye]] led the movement to build the {{convert|2175|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Appalachian Trail]], stretching from Georgia to [[Maine]].

By the 1950s, poor farming techniques and the loss of jobs to [[mechanization]] in the mining industry had left much of central and southern Appalachia poverty-stricken. The lack of jobs also led to widespread difficulties with [[emigration|outmigration]]. Beginning in the 1930s, federal agencies such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] began investing in the Appalachian region.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;{{rp|310–12}} [[Sociologist]]s such as James Brown and Cratis Williams and authors such as [[Harry Caudill]] and [[Michael Harrington]] brought attention to the region's plight in the 1960s, prompting Congress to create the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] in 1965. The commission's efforts helped to stem the tide of outmigration and diversify the region's economies.&lt;ref name=drake/&gt;{{rp|200–210}} Although there have been drastic improvements in the region's economic conditions since the commission's founding, the ARC still listed 82 counties as "distressed" in 2010, with nearly half of them (40) in Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arc.gov/appalachian_region/ARCDesignatedDistressedCountiesFiscalYear2010.asp |title= ARC-Designated Distressed Counties, Fiscal Year 2010 |publisher=Appalachian Regional Commission |accessdate=August 17, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100914113108/http://www.arc.gov/appalachian_region/ARCDesignatedDistressedCountiesFiscalYear2010.asp| archivedate= September 14, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic groups===

An estimated 90%&lt;ref&gt;Newhall, David, "English." ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 253–55.&lt;/ref&gt; of Appalachia's earliest European settlers originated from the Anglo-Scottish border country—namely the [[Historic counties of England|English counties]] of [[Cumberland]], [[Westmorland]], [[Northumberland]], [[County Durham]], [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]], and the Lowland [[Shires of Scotland|Scottish counties]] of [[Ayrshire]], [[Dumfriesshire]], [[Roxburghshire]], [[Berwickshire]] and [[Wigtownshire]]. Most of these were from families who had been resettled in the [[Ulster Plantation]] in northern Ireland in the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, Parke Jr., ''The Great Wagon Road'', Dietz Press, 2004, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leyburn, James G., ''The Scotch-Irish: A Social History'', Univ. of NC Press, 1962, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; but some came directly from the Anglo-Scottish border region.&lt;ref name=fischer1&gt;[[David Hackett Fischer|Fischer, David Hackett]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), pp. 620–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In America, these people are often grouped under the single name "[[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]]" or "Scots-Irish". While various 20th century writers tried to associate Appalachia with [[Scottish Highlands|Scottish highlanders]], Highland Scots were a relatively insignificant percentage of the region's early European immigrants.&lt;ref name=fischer1 /&gt;

Although Swedes and Finns formed only a tiny portion of the Appalachian settlers it was Swedish and Finnish settlers of [[New Sweden#Significance and legacy|New Sweden]] who brought the northern European woodsman skills such as [[log cabin]] construction which formed the basis of backwoods Appalachian material culture.&lt;ref name = Stoll&gt;"DANIEL BOONE’S CULTURAL ANCESTORS, if not actually his genetic ones,..." Stoll, Steven. Ramp Hollow: The Ordeal of Appalachia (p. 86-88). Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[German Americans|Germans]] were a major pioneer group to migrate to Appalachia, settling mainly in western Pennsylvania and [[southwest Virginia]]. Smaller numbers of Germans were also among the initial wave of migrants to the southern mountains.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;{{rp|30–44}} In the 19th century, [[Welsh Americans|Welsh immigrants]] were brought into the region for their mining and metallurgical expertise, and by 1900 over 100,000 [[Wales|Welsh]] immigrants were living in western Pennsylvania alone.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, John, "Welsh". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of [[Swiss German|German-speaking Swiss]] migrated to Appalachia in the second half of the 19th century, and their descendants remain in places such as [[East Bernstadt, Kentucky]], and [[Gruetli-Laager, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Betler, Bruce, "Swiss". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 281–82.&lt;/ref&gt; The coal mining and manufacturing boom in the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought large numbers of [[Italian Americans|Italians]] and [[Eastern Europe]]ans to Appalachia, although most of these families left the region when the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] shattered the economy in the 1930s. [[African Americans]] have been present in the region since the 18th century, and currently make up 8% of the ARC-designated region, mostly concentrated in urban areas and former mining and manufacturing towns.&lt;ref&gt;Billings, Dwight, and Kathleen Blee, "African-American Families and Communities." ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 155–56.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], the region's original inhabitants, are only a small percentage of the region's present population, their most notable concentration being the reservation of the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]] in North Carolina.

''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:BaptismMoreheadMPostWolcottA.jpg|thumb|225px|right|[[Baptism#Submersion|Baptism]] in [[Morehead, Kentucky]], photographed by [[Marion Post Wolcott]] in 1940]]

[[Christianity]] has long been the main religion in Appalachia. Religion in Appalachia is characterized by a sense of independence and a distrust of religious [[hierarchical organization|hierarchies]], both rooted in the [[evangelical]] tendencies of the region's pioneers, many of whom had been influenced by the "[[New Light]]" movement in England. Many of the denominations brought from Europe underwent modifications or factioning during the [[Second Great Awakening]] (especially the [[holiness movement]]) in the early 19th century. A number of 18th and 19th-century religious traditions are still practiced in parts of Appalachia, including natural water (or "creek") [[baptism]], rhythmically chanted preaching, congregational shouting, [[snake handling]], and [[foot washing]]. While most church-goers in Appalachia attend fairly well organized churches affiliated with regional or national bodies, small unaffiliated congregations are not uncommon in rural mountain areas.&lt;ref&gt;Dorgan, Howard, Introduction to the "Religion" section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1281–89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grammich /&gt;

[[Protestantism]] is the most dominant denomination in Appalachia, although there is a significant [[Catholic Church in the United States|Roman Catholic]] presence in the northern half of the region and in urban areas, like Pittsburgh and Scranton. The region's early Lowland and Ulster Scot immigrants brought [[Presbyterianism]] to Appalachia, eventually organizing into bodies such as the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Ostwalt, Conrad, "Presbyterian, Denominational Family". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1342–44.&lt;/ref&gt; English [[Baptists]]—most of whom had been influenced by the [[Separate Baptist]] and [[Regular Baptist]] movements—were also common on the Appalachian frontier, and today are represented in the region by groups such as the [[Free Will Baptist]]s, the [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptists]], [[Missionary Baptists]], and "old-time" groups such as the [[United Baptist]]s and [[Primitive Baptists]].&lt;ref name=grammich&gt;Grammich, Clifford, "Baptists, the Old-Time Groups". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1298–300.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Circuit rider (religious)|Circuit riders]] such as [[Francis Asbury]] helped spread [[Methodism]] to Appalachia in the early 19th century, and today 9.2% of the region's population is Methodist, represented by such bodies as the [[United Methodist Church]], the [[Free Methodist Church]], and the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Bean, Heather Ann Ackley, "Methodists". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1330–32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pentecostal]] movements within the region include the [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]] (based in [[Cleveland, Tennessee]]) and the [[Assemblies of God USA|Assemblies of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Stanley, Patrick Alexander, and Gary McGee, "Pentecostals". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1336–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Scattered [[Mennonite]] colonies exist throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeldt, Harvey, "Mennonites". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1327–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialect===
{{See also|Appalachian English}}
The Appalachian dialect is a dialect of [[Midland American English]] known as the Southern Midland dialect, and is spoken primarily in central and southern Appalachia. The Northern Midland dialect is spoken in the northern parts of the region, while [[Pittsburgh English]] (more commonly known as "Pittsburghese") is strongly influenced by Appalachian dialect.&lt;ref name="Johnstone PBS"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnstone |first=Barbara |title=Steel Town Speak |journal=[[Language magazine]] |url=https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/pittsburghese/ |accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Appalachian dialect is considered part of the [[Southern American English|Southern American dialect]],&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William, Sharon Ash &amp; Charles Boberg, ''Atlas of North American English'', Mouton de Gruyter, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/MapsS/Map1S.html South Regional Map]&lt;/ref&gt; although the two are distinguished by the [[rhoticity in English|rhotic]] nature of the Appalachian dialect. Early 20th century writers believed the Appalachian dialect to be a surviving relic of Old World Scottish or Elizabethan dialects. Recent research suggests, however, that while the dialect has a stronger Scottish influence than other American dialects, most of its distinguishing characteristics are American in origin.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, Montgomery, "Language – Introduction", ''The Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 999–1004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
For much of the region's history, education in Appalachia has lagged behind the rest of the nation due in part to struggles with funding from respective state governments and an agrarian-oriented population that often failed to see a practical need for formal education. Early education in the region evolved from teaching Christian morality and learning to read the [[Bible]] into small, [[one-room school]]houses that convened in months when children were not needed to help with farm work. After the Civil War, mandatory education laws and state assistance helped larger communities begin to establish graded schools and high schools. During the same period, many of the region's institutions of higher education were established or greatly expanded.&lt;ref name=deyoung&gt;DeYoung, Alan, Introduction to Education section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1517–21.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, service organizations such as [[Pi Beta Phi]] and various religious organizations established [[settlement school]]s and mission schools in the region's more rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Alvic, Philis, "Settlement, Mission, and Sponsored Schools," ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), p. 1551.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, national trends began to have more of an effect on education in Appalachia, sometimes clashing with the region's traditional values. The [[Scopes Trial]]—the nation's most publicized debate over the teaching of the theory of [[evolution]]—took place in [[Dayton, Tennessee]], in southern Appalachia in 1925. In spite of consolidation and centralization, schools in Appalachia struggled to keep up with federal and state demands into the 21st century. Since 2001, a number of the region's public schools were threatened with loss of funding due to difficulties fulfilling the demands of [[No Child Left Behind]].&lt;ref name=deyoung /&gt;

===Music===
{{Main article|Appalachian music}}
Appalachian music is one of the best-known manifestations of Appalachian culture. Traditional Appalachian music is derived primarily from the English and Scottish [[ballad]] tradition and Irish and Scottish [[fiddle]] music. African-American [[blues]] musicians played a significant role in developing the instrumental aspects of Appalachian music, most notably with the introduction of the five-stringed [[banjo]]—one of the region's iconic symbols—in the late 18th century. Another instrument known in Appalachian culture was the [[Appalachian dulcimer]] which, in a practical way, is a guitar-shaped instrument laid on its side with a flat bottom and the strings plucked in a manner to make alternating notes.

In the years following World War I, British folklorist [[Cecil Sharp]] brought attention to Southern Appalachia when he noted that its inhabitants still sang hundreds of English and Scottish ballads that had been passed down to them from their ancestors. Commercial recordings of Appalachian musicians in the 1920s would have a significant impact on the development of [[country music]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and [[old-time music]]. Appalachian music saw a resurgence in popularity during the [[American folk music revival]] of the 1960s, when musicologists such as [[Mike Seeger]], [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], and [[Ralph Rinzler]] traveled to remote parts of the region in search of musicians unaffected by modern music. Today, dozens of annual music festivals held throughout the region preserve the Appalachian music tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Ted, "Music – Introduction". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1109–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
[[File:Hazel-creek-proctor-nc1.jpg|210px|thumb|Former site of [[Proctor, North Carolina]], setting of [[Horace Kephart|Kephart's]] book, ''[[Our Southern Highlanders]]]]
Early Appalachian literature typically centered on the observations of people from outside the region, such as [[Henry Timberlake]]'s ''Memoirs'' (1765) and [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1784), although there are notable exceptions, including [[Davy Crockett]]'s ''A Narrative of the Life of Davy Crockett'' (1834). Travellers' accounts published in 19th-century magazines gave rise to Appalachian [[American literary regionalism|local color]], which reached its height with [[George Washington Harris]]'s Sut Lovingood character of the 1860s and native novelists such as [[Mary Noailles Murfree]]. Works such as [[Rebecca Harding Davis]]'s ''Life in the Iron Mills'' (1861), [[Emma Bell Miles]]' ''The Spirit of the Mountains'' (1905), and [[Horace Kephart]]'s ''[[Our Southern Highlanders]]'' (1913) marked a shift in the region's literature from local color to realism. The transition from an agrarian society to an industrial society and its effects on Appalachia are captured in works such as [[Olive Tilford Dargan]]'s ''Call Home to the Heart'' (1932), [[Agnes Sligh Turnbull]]'s ''[[The Rolling Years]]'' (1936), [[James Still]]'s ''The River of Earth'' (1940), [[Harriette Simpson Arnow]]'s ''The Dollmaker'' (1954), and [[Harry Caudill]]'s ''[[Night Comes to the Cumberlands]]'' (1962). In the 1970s and 1980s, the rise of authors like [[Breece D'J Pancake]], [[Dorothy Allison]], and [[Lisa Alther]] brought greater literary diversity to the region.&lt;ref name=toney&gt;Edwards, Grace Toney, "Literature – Introduction," ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1035–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the above-mentioned, some of Appalachia's best known writers include [[James Agee]] (''[[A Death in the Family]]''), [[Anne W. Armstrong]] (''This Day and Time''), [[Wendell Berry]] (''Hannah Coulter'', ''The Unforeseen Wilderness: An Essay on Kentucky's Red River Gorge'', ''Selected Poems of Wendell Berry''), [[Jesse Stuart]] (''Taps for Private Tussie'', ''The Thread That Runs So True''), [[Denise Giardina]] (''The Unquiet Earth'', ''Storming Heaven''), [[Lee Smith (fiction author)|Lee Smith]] (''Fair and Tender Ladies'', ''On Agate Hill''), [[Silas House]] (''Clay's Quilt'', ''A Parchment of Leaves''), [[Wilma Dykeman]] (''The Far Family'', ''The Tall Woman''), [[Keith Maillard]] (''Alex Driving South'', ''Light in the Company of Women'', ''Hazard Zones'', ''Gloria'', ''Running'', ''Morgantown'', ''Lyndon Johnson and the Majorettes'', ''Looking Good'')  [[Maurice Manning (poet)|Maurice Manning]] (''Bucolics'', ''A Companion for Owls''), Anne Shelby (''Appalachian Studies'', ''We Keep a Store''), [[George Ella Lyon]] (''Borrowed Children'', ''Don't You Remember?''), [[Pamela Duncan (novelist)|Pamela Duncan]] (''Moon Women'', ''The Big Beautiful''), [[David Joy (author)|David Joy]] ("Where All Light Tends to Go," "The Weight of This World"), [[Chris Offutt]] (''No Heroes'', ''The Good Brother''), [[Charles Frazier]] (''[[Cold Mountain (novel)|Cold Mountain]]'', ''Thirteen Moons''), [[Sharyn McCrumb]] (''The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter''), [[Robert Morgan (poet)|Robert Morgan]] (''Gap Creek''), [[Jim Wayne Miller]] (''The Brier Poems''), [[Gurney Norman]] (''Divine Right's Trip'', ''Kinfolks''), [[Ron Rash]] (''Serena''), [[Elizabeth Madox Roberts]] ("The Great Meadow, "The Time of Man"), [[Thomas Wolfe]] (''Look Homeward Angel'', ''You Can't Go Home Again''), [[Rachel Carson]] (''[[The Sea Around Us]]'', ''[[Silent Spring]]''; [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]), and [[Jeannette Walls]] (''[[The Glass Castle]]'').

Appalachian literature crosses with the larger genre of [[Southern literature]]. Internationally renowned writers such as [[William Faulkner]] and [[Cormac McCarthy]] have made notable contributions to the American canon with tales set within Appalachia. McCarthy's ''[[Suttree]]'' (1979) is an intense vision of the squalidness and brutality of life along the [[Tennessee River]], in the heart of Appalachia. Other McCarthy novels set in Appalachia include ''[[The Orchard Keeper]]'' (1968) and ''[[Child of God]]'' (1973). Appalachia also serves as the origin point for the kid, the protagonist of McCarthy's Western masterpiece ''[[Blood Meridian]]''. Faulkner's hometown of [[Oxford, Mississippi]], is on the borderlands of what is considered Appalachia, but his fictional [[Yoknapatawpha]] should be considered part of the region.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Almost all of the fiction which earned him the Nobel Prize is set there, including ''[[Light in August]]'' and ''[[Absalom, Absalom]]''.

===Folklore===
[[File:John Henry-27527.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Statue of legendary railroad worker [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] in [[Talcott, West Virginia]]]]

Appalachian folklore has a strong mixture of European, Native American (especially [[Cherokee]]), and Biblical influences. The Cherokee taught the region's early European pioneers how to plant and cultivate crops such as [[maize|corn]] and [[squash (plant)|squash]] and how to find edible plants such as [[Allium tricoccum|ramps]].&lt;ref name=handbook /&gt; The Cherokee also passed along their knowledge of the medicinal properties of hundreds of native herbs and roots, and how to prepare tonics from such plants.&lt;ref name=handbook /&gt; Before the introduction of modern agricultural techniques in the region in the 1930s and 1940s, many Appalachian farmers followed the Biblical tradition of planting by "the signs", such as the [[lunar phase|phases of the moon]], or when certain weather conditions occurred.&lt;ref name=handbook /&gt;

Cherokee folklore continues to influence storytelling in the Appalachians, including depictions and characteristics of regional animals. As told by [[Eastern Band Cherokee]] and [[western North Carolina]] storyteller Jerry Wolfe, these creatures include the [[chipmunk]], also known as "seven stripes" from an angry [[bear]] scratching him down the back—four claw marks and the spaces in between making seven—and the [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]] who sneaks and thieves his way into becoming venomous.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, Saundra Gerrell (2011). ''Southern Appalachian Storytellers: Interviews with Sixteen Keepers of the Oral Tradition''. Jefferson: McFarland Publishing. p. 205–07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Appalachian folk tales are rooted in English, Scottish, and Irish fairy tales, as well as regional heroic figures and events. [[Jack tales]], which tend to revolve around the exploits of a simple-but-dedicated figure named "[[Jack (hero)|Jack]]", are popular at story-telling festivals. Other stories involve wild animals, such as hunting tales. In the industrial areas of western Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia the composite [[Joe Magarac]] steelworker story has been handed down. Regional folk heroes such as the railroad worker [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] and frontiersmen [[Davy Crockett]], [[Mike Fink]] and [[Johnny Appleseed]] are examples of real-life figures that evolved into popular folk tale subjects. Murder stories, such as [[Omie Wise]] and [[John Hardy (song)|John Hardy]], are popular subjects for Appalachian ballads. Ghost stories, or "[[:wikt:haint|haint]] tales" in regional English,&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of American Regional English'', Belknap Press, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; are a common feature of southern oral and literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Flora, Joseph M., Lucinda Hardwick MacKethan, Todd W. Taylor, ''The Companion to Southern Literature'', [[Louisiana State University Press]], 2001, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghost stories native to the region include the story of the [[Greenbrier Ghost]], which is rooted in a [[Greenbrier County, West Virginia]], murder.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;Deborah Thompson and Irene Moser, "Appalachian Folklife." ''A Handbook to Appalachia: An Introduction to the Region'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 143–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s the [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia]], legend of [[Mothman]] has originated and been explored in popular culture including the 2002 film ''[[The Mothman Prophecies]]'' loosely retelling the original tale.

===Urban Appalachians===
{{Main article|Urban Appalachians}}
Urban Appalachians are people from Appalachia who are living in metropolitan areas outside the Appalachian region. In the decades following the Great Depression and World War II, many Appalachian residents moved to industrial cities in the north and west in a migration that became known as the "[[Hillbilly Highway]]". Mechanization of coal mining during the 1950s and 1960s was the major source of unemployment in central Appalachia. Many migration streams covered relatively short distances, with West Virginians moving to [[Cleveland]] and other cities in eastern and central [[Ohio]], and eastern Kentuckians moving to [[Cincinnati]] and southwest Ohio in search of jobs. More distant cities like [[Detroit]] and [[Chicago]] attracted migrants from many states. Enclaves of Appalachian culture can still be found in some of these communities.&lt;ref&gt;''Appalachian Odyssey'', ed. Phillip J. Obermiller et al. (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communications===
In the 1940s through the 1960s, [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], became a cultural center of the region because it had a [[clear-channel station|clear-channel]] [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] radio station, [[WWVA (AM)|WWVA]], which could be heard throughout the entirety of the eastern United States at night. Although Pittsburgh's [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] was a 50 kilowatt clear channel station that dated back to the early 1920s (as well as spanning all the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] in signal strength), WWVA prided itself on rural and farm programming that appealed to a wider audience in the rural region.  Cincinnati's [[WLW]] also was relied on by many in the central and northern areas of Appalachia.

In the southern part of the region, [[WSB-AM]] Atlanta and [[WSM-AM]] Nashville, flagship of the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', were major stations for the region's population during the 20th century, and remain strong in the sub-region.

===Appalachian studies===
{{Main article|Appalachian studies}}
Appalachia as an academic interest was the product of a critical scholarship that emerged across the disciplines in the 1960s and 1970s. With a renewed interest in issues of power, scholars could not dismiss the social inequity, class conflict, and environmental destruction encountered by [[United States|America's]] so-called "[[Hillbilly|hillbillies]]". Appalachia's emergence in academia is a result of the intersection between social conditions and critical academic interests, and has resulted in the development of many [[Appalachian studies]] programs in colleges and universities across the region, as well as in the [[Appalachian Studies Association]].

==Economy==
The economy of Appalachia traditionally rested on agriculture, mining, timber, and in the cities, manufacturing. Since the late 20th century, [[tourism]] and second-home developments have assumed an increasingly major role.

While the climate of the Appalachian region is suitable for agriculture, the region's hilly terrain greatly limits the size of the average farm, a problem exacerbated by population growth in the latter half of the 19th century. [[Subsistence agriculture|Subsistence farming]] was the backbone of the Appalachian economy throughout much of the 19th century, and while economies in places such as western Pennsylvania, the [[Great Appalachian Valley|Great Valley]] of Virginia, and the upper Tennessee Valley in east Tennessee, transitioned to a large-scale farming or manufacturing base around the time of the Civil War, subsistence farming remained an important part of the region's economy until the 1950s. In the early 20th century, Appalachian farmers were struggling to mechanize, and abusive farming practices had over the years left much of the already-limited farmland badly eroded. Various federal entities intervened in the 1930s to restore damaged areas and introduce less-harmful farming techniques. In recent decades, the concept of [[sustainable agriculture]] has been applied to the region's small farms, with some success. Nevertheless, the number of farms in the Appalachian region continues to dwindle, plunging from 354,748 farms on {{convert|47|e6acre|km2}} in 1969 to 230,050 farms on {{convert|35|e6acre|km2}} in 1997.&lt;ref name=agintro&gt;Best, Michael, and Curtis Wood, Introduction to the Agriculture section in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Appalachia]]'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 395–402.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Appalachian farmers grew both crops introduced from their native Europe as well as crops native to North America (such as [[maize|corn]] and [[squash (plant)|squash]]). [[Tobacco]] has long been an important [[cash crop]] in Southern Appalachia, especially since the land is ill-suited for cash crops such as [[cotton]]. Apples have been grown in the region since the late 18th century, their cultivation being aided by the presence of thermal belts in the region's mountain valleys.  Hogs, which could [[free range]] in the region's abundant forests, often on [[chestnut]]s, were the most popular livestock among early Appalachian farmers. The [[American chestnut]] was also an important human food source until the [[chestnut blight]] struck in the 20th century. The early settlers also brought cattle and sheep to the region, which they would typically graze in highland meadows known as [[Appalachian balds|balds]] during the growing season when bottomlands were needed for crops. Cattle, mainly the [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]], [[Angus cattle|Angus]], and [[Charolais cattle|Charolais]] breeds, are now the region's chief livestock.&lt;ref name=agintro /&gt;

===Logging===
[[File:Erwin-millpond-sawmill-wv1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sawmill and millpond in Erwin, West Virginia, photographed by [[Marion Post Wolcott]] in 1938]]

The mountains and valleys of Appalachia once contained what seemed to be an inexhaustible supply of timber. The poor roads, lack of railroads, and general inaccessibility of the region, however, prevented large-scale logging in most of the region throughout much of the 19th century. While logging firms were established in the Carolinas and the [[Kentucky River]] valley before the Civil War, most major firms preferred to harvest the more accessible timber stands in the Midwestern and Northeastern parts of the country. By the 1880s, these stands had been exhausted, and a spike in the demand for lumber forced logging firms to seek out the virgin forests of Appalachia.&lt;ref name=paulson&gt;Paulson, Linda Daily, "Lumber Industry". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 501–04.&lt;/ref&gt; The first major logging ventures in Appalachia transported logs using mule teams or rivers, the latter method sometimes employing [[splash dam]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Weals, Vic. ''The Last Train to Elkmont'' (Knoxville, Tennessee: Olden Press, 1993), pp. 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1890s, innovations such as the [[Shay locomotive]], the steam-powered loader, and the steam-powered [[skidder]] allowed massive harvesting of the most remote forest sections.&lt;ref name=paulson /&gt;

Logging in Appalachia reached its peak in the early 20th century, when firms such as the Ritter Lumber Company cut the virgin forests on an alarming scale, leading to the creation of [[United States National Forest|national forests]] in 1911 and similar state entities to better manage the region's timber resources. Arguably the most successful logging firm in Appalachia was the Georgia Hardwood Lumber Company, established in 1927 and renamed [[Georgia-Pacific]] in 1948 when it expanded nationally. Although logging in Appalachia declined as the industry shifted focus to the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the 1950s, rising overseas demand in the 1980s brought a resurgence in Appalachian logging. In 1987, there were 4,810 lumber firms operating in the region. In the late 1990s, the Appalachian lumber industry was a multibillion-dollar industry, employing 50,000 people in Tennessee, 26,000 in Kentucky, and 12,000 in West Virginia alone.&lt;ref name=paulson /&gt; By 1999, 1.4 million acres were extinguished as a result of [[deforestation]] by natural resource industries.{{Clarify|date=June 2017|Not clear how land can be "extinguished"}} Pollution from mining processes and disruption of the land ensued numerous environmental issues. Removal of vegetation and other alterations in the land increased erosion and flooding of surrounding areas.

===Coal mining===

[[Coal mining]] is the industry most frequently associated with the region in outsiders' minds,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nma.org/pdf/c_bearing_areas.pdf |title=Coal-Bearing Areas of the United States |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040222075821/http://www.nma.org/pdf/c_bearing_areas.pdf |archive-date=February 22, 2004 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nma.org/pdf/c_locations.pdf |title=Coal mines and facilities |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615060022/http://www.nma.org/pdf/c_locations.pdf |archive-date=June 15, 2007 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; due in part to the fact that the region once produced two-thirds of the nation's coal. At present, however, the mining industry employs just 2% of the Appalachian workforce. The region's vast coalfield covers {{convert|63000|sqmi|km2}} between northern Pennsylvania and central Alabama, mostly along the [[Cumberland Plateau]] and [[Allegheny Plateau]] regions. Most mining activity has been concentrated in eastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia, West Virginia, and western Pennsylvania, with smaller operations in [[western Maryland]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Alabama]]. The [[Pittsburgh coal seam]], which has produced 13 billion tons of coal since the early 19th century, has been called the world's most valuable mineral deposit. There are over 60 major coal seams in West Virginia, and over 80 in eastern Kentucky. Most of the coal mined is [[bituminous coal|bituminous]], although significant [[anthracite]] deposits exist on the fringe of the region in central Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=abramsoncoal&gt;Abramson, Rudy, "Bituminous Coal Industry." ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 457–60.&lt;/ref&gt; About two-thirds of Appalachia's coal is produced by [[Coal mining#Underground mining|underground mining]], the rest by [[Coal mining#Surface mining|surface mining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.org/pdf/c_production_method.pdf |title=U.S. Coal Production by State, Region and Method of Mining – 2007 |publisher=National Mining Association |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mountaintop removal]], a form of surface mining, is a highly controversial mining practice in central Appalachia due to its negative impacts on the environment and health of local residents.&lt;ref name=abramsoncoal /&gt;

In the late 19th century, the post-Civil War [[Industrial Revolution in the United States|Industrial Revolution]] and the expansion of the nation's railroads brought a soaring demand for coal, and mining operations expanded rapidly across Appalachia. Hundreds of thousands of workers poured into the region from across the United States and from overseas, essentially overhauling the cultural makeup of [[Eastern Kentucky Coalfield|eastern Kentucky]], West Virginia, and western Pennsylvania. Mining corporations gained considerable influence in state and municipal governments, especially as they often owned the entire towns in which the miners lived. The mining industry was vulnerable to economic downturns, however, and booms and busts were frequent, with major booms occurring during World War I and II, and the worst bust occurring during the Great Depression. The Appalachian mining industry also saw some of the nation's bloodiest labor strife between the 1890s and the 1930s. Mining-related injuries and deaths were not uncommon, and ailments such as [[coalworker's pneumoconiosis|black lung disease]] afflicted miners throughout the 20th century. After World War II, innovations in mechanization (such as [[longwall mining]]) and competition from oil and natural gas led to a decline in the region's mining operations.&lt;ref name=abramsoncoal /&gt; Environmental restrictions, such as those placed on high-[[sulfur]] coal in the 1980s, brought further mine closures. While with annual earnings of $55,000, Appalachian miners make more than most other local workers, Appalachian coal mining employed just under 50,000 in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.org/pdf/c_profile.pdf |format=PDF |title=Profile of the U.S. Coal Miner – 2007 |publisher=[[National Mining Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.org/pdf/c_employment_state_region_method.pdf |format=PDF |title=U.S. Coal Mine Employment by State, Region and Method of Mining – 2007 |publisher=National Mining Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coal mining has made a comeback in some regions in the early 21st century because of the increased prominence of [[Consol Energy]], based in [[Pittsburgh]]. The [[Quecreek Mine rescue]] in 2002 and continuing [[mine subsidence]] problems in abandoned coal mines in [[western Pennsylvania]] as well as the [[Sago Mine disaster]] and [[Upper Big Branch Mine disaster]] in West Virginia and other regions have also been highlighted in recent times.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===Manufacturing===
[[File:Institute-plant-tanks-wv1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Storage tanks at the [[Institute, West Virginia|Institute]] plant along the [[Kanawha River]] in West Virginia, photographed late 1930s/early 1940s]]

The manufacturing industry in Appalachia is rooted primarily in the ironworks and steelworks of early [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], and in the textile mills that sprang up in North Carolina's [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region in the mid-19th century. Factory construction increased greatly after the Civil War, and the region experienced a manufacturing boom between 1890 and 1930. This economic shift led to a mass migration from small farms and rural areas to large urban centers, causing the populations of cities such as Birmingham, [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], and [[Asheville, North Carolina]], to swell exponentially. Manufacturing in the region suffered a setback during the Great Depression, but recovered during World War II and peaked in the 1950s and 1960s. However, difficulties paying retiree benefits, environmental struggles, and the signing of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) in 1994 led to a decline in the region's manufacturing operations. Pittsburgh lost 44% of its factory jobs in the 1980s, and between 1970 and 2001, the number of [[apparel]] workers in the Appalachian region decreased from 250,000 to 83,000 and the number of textile workers decreased from 275,000 to 193,000.&lt;ref name=hursteoa&gt;Hurst, Jack, Introduction to Business, Technology, and Industry section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee, 2006), pp. 441–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies such as Champion Fibre and [[Bowater]] established large [[pulp (paper)|pulp]] operations in [[Canton, North Carolina]], and [[Greenville, South Carolina]], respectively, although the former was dogged by battles with environmentalists throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Varat, Daniel, "Champion Fibre", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 466–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===

One of the region's oldest industries, tourism became a more important part of the Appalachian economy in the latter half of the 20th century as mining and manufacturing steadily declined.&lt;ref name=howell&gt;Howell, Benita, "Tourism". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 611–16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000–2001, tourism in Appalachia accounted for nearly $30 billion and over 600,000 jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=1897 "Economic Effects of Tourism in Appalachia"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814091248/http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=1897 |date=August 14, 2009 }}.

Important theme parks include [[Dollywood]] and [[Ghost Town Village]], both on the periphery of the [[Great Smoky Mountains]].

The mineral-rich mountain springs of the Appalachians—which for many years were thought to have health-restoring qualities—were drawing visitors to the region as early as the 18th century with the establishment of resorts at [[Hot Springs, Virginia]], [[White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia]], and what is now [[Hot Springs, North Carolina]]. Along with the [[mineral spring]]s, the cool and clear air of the range's high elevations provided an escape for lowland elites, and elaborate hotels—such as [[The Greenbrier]] in West Virginia and the [[Balsam Mountain Inn]] in North Carolina—were built throughout the region's remote valleys and mountain slopes. The end of World War I (which opened up travel opportunities to Europe) and the arrival of the automobile (which changed the nation's vacation habits) led to the demise of all but a few of the region's spa resorts. The establishment of national parks in the 1930s brought an explosion of tourist traffic to the region, but created problems with [[urban sprawl]] in the various host communities. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, states have placed greater focus on sustaining tourism while preserving host communities.&lt;ref name=howell /&gt;

===Poverty in Appalachia===
{{See also|Social and economic stratification in Appalachia}}

[[Poverty]] had plagued Appalachia for many years but was not brought to the attention of the rest of the United States until 1940, when [[James Agee]] and [[Walker Evans]] published ''[[Let Us Now Praise Famous Men]]'', a book that documented families in Appalachia during the Great Depression in words and photos. In 1963, [[John F. Kennedy]] established the President's Appalachian Regional Commission. His successor, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], crystallized Kennedy's efforts in the form of the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]], which passed into law in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=7 ARC History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222133844/http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=7 |date=December 22, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Appalachia, severe poverty and desolation were paired with the necessity for careful cultural sensitivity. Many Appalachian people&lt;!--how many?--&gt; feared that the birth of a new modernized Appalachia would lead to the death of their traditional values and heritage. Because of the isolation of the region, Appalachian people had been unable to catch up to the modernization that lowlanders have achieved. In the 1960s, many people in Appalachia had a [[standard of living]] comparable to [[Third World]] countries'. The film series "West Virginia", produced during the term of Governor [[Gaston Caperton]], makes the point that at least on some level images of poverty were contrived.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Lyndon B. Johnson declared a "[[War on Poverty]]" while standing on the front porch of an [[Inez, Kentucky]], home whose residents had been suffering from a long-ignored problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-04-23-mccain-ky_N.htm |title=McCain's economics talk follows LBJ path |first=David |last=Jackson |work=USA Today |date=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 stated:

Since the creation of the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) in 1965, the region has seen dramatic progress. New roads, schools, health care facilities, water and sewer systems, and other improvements have brought a better life to many Appalachian residents. In the 1960s, 219 [[county (United States)|counties]] in the 13-state Appalachian Region were considered economically distressed. Now that list has been cut by more than half, to 82 counties, but these are "hard-core" pockets of poverty, seemingly impervious to all efforts at improving their lot.&lt;ref name="Arc"&gt;Appalachian Regional Commission [http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=3301 Arc.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407182313/http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=3301 |date=April 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin County, Kentucky]], the site of Johnson's 1964 speech, is one such county still ranked as "distressed" by the ARC. As of 2000, the [[per capita income]] in Martin County was $10,650, and 37% of its residents lived below the poverty line.

Like Johnson, President [[Bill Clinton]] brought attention to the remaining areas of poverty in Appalachia. On July 5, 1999, he made a public statement concerning the situation in [[Tyner, Kentucky]]. Clinton told the enthusiastic crowd:

{{quote|I'm here to make a simple point. This is the time to bring more jobs and investment to parts of the country that have not participated in this time of prosperity. Any work that can be done by anybody in America can be done in Appalachia.&lt;ref name="Arc"/&gt;}}

The region's poverty has been documented often since the early 1960s. [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]] documents rural lifestyle and culture in ''The High Lonesome Sound'', while [[Photojournalism|photojournalist]] [[Earl Dotter]] has been visiting and documenting poverty, healthcare and mining in Appalachia for nearly forty years.&lt;ref name="Dotter"&gt;Dotter, Earl. "[http://southernspaces.org/2008/coalfield-generations-health-mining-and-environment Coalfield Generations: Health, Mining and the Environment]" ''Southern Spaces'', July 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Another photojournalist, [[Shelby Lee Adams]], has been photographing Appalachian families and lifestyle for decades.

===Tax revenue and absentee land ownership===
In 1982 a seven-volume study conducted by the Appalachian Land Ownership Task Force was issued by the Appalachian Regional Commission which investigated the issue of absentee land ownership. The study covered 80 counties in six states approximating the area designated "Southern Appalachia" as defined by Thomas R. Ford's 1962 work. The states selected were Alabama (15 counties), Kentucky (12 counties), North Carolina (12 counties), Tennessee (14 counties), Virginia (12 counties), and West Virginia (15 counties).
[[File:Map of counties included in the 1982 report of the Appalachian Land Ownership Task Force.png|thumb|Map showing the 80 counties included in the 1982 report by the Appalachian Land Ownership Task Force]]

In its summary the report stated that "over 55,000 parcels of property in 80 counties were studied, representing some 20,000,000 acres of land and mineral rights..." It found that "41% of the 20 million acres of land and minerals...are held by only 50 private owners and 10 government agencies. The federal government is the single largest owner in Appalachia, holding over 2,000,000 acres." The study found that the extractive industries, i.e., timber, coal, etc., were "greatly underassessed for property tax purposes. Over 75% of the mineral owners in this survey pay under 25 cents per acre in property taxes." In the major coal counties surveyed the average tax per ton of known coal reserves is only $.0002 (1/50th of a cent).
The government-held lands are tax exempt, but the government makes a [[payment in lieu of taxes]], which is usually less than the normal tax rates.

"Taken together, the failure to tax minerals adequately, the underassessment of surface lands, and the revenue loss from concentrated federal holdings has a marked impact on local governments in Appalachia. The effect, essentially, is to produce a situation in which a) the small owners carry a disproportionate share of the tax burden; b) counties depend upon federal and state funds to provide revenues, while the large, corporate and absentee owners of the regions's resources go relatively tax-free; and c) citizens face a poverty of needed services despite the presence in their counties of taxable property wealth, especially in the form of coal and other natural resources."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmw.net/files/1981_Land_Ownership_Study.pdf ''Land Ownership Patterns and Their Impacts on Appalachian Communities. A Survey of 80 Counties''], pgs. 27–29&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a similar study that concentrated solely on West Virginia found that 25 private owners hold 17.6% of the state's private land of 13 million acres. The federal government owns 1,133,587 acres in West Virginia, 7.4% of the total state acreage of 15,410,560 acres.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42346.pdf Federal Land Ownership: Overview and Data]&lt;/ref&gt; In 11 counties the top ten absentee landowners own 41% to almost 72% of the private land in each county.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvpolicy.org/who-owns-west-virginia-in-the-21st-century-2 Who Owns West Virginia in the 21st Century]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appalachian Regional Commission===
{{main article|Appalachian Regional Commission}}
The [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] (ARC) was created by the [[U.S. Congress]] in 1965 to bring poor areas of the 13 U.S. states of the main (southern) range of the Appalachians into the mainstream of the American economy. The commission is a partnership of federal, state, and local governments, and was created to promote economic growth and improve the quality of life in the region. The region as defined by the ARC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=27 |title=Counties in Appalachia |publisher=Appalachian Regional Commission |accessdate=August 22, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917184038/http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=27 |archivedate=September 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; includes 420 counties, including all of West Virginia; counties in 13 other states: Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia; and also eight [[Political subdivisions of Virginia#Independent cities|cities]] in Virginia, where state law makes cities administratively separate from counties. The ARC is a planning, research, advocacy and funding organization; it does not have any governing powers.

The ARC's geographic range of coverage was defined broadly so as to cover as many economically underdeveloped areas as possible; it extends well beyond the area usually thought of as "Appalachia". For instance, parts of Alabama and Mississippi were included in the commission because of problems with unemployment and poverty similar to those in Appalachia proper, and the ARC region extends into the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] states, which are not traditionally considered part of Appalachia culturally (though a "northern Appalachia" identity has emerged in recent times in parts of both NY and PA, particularly in rural areas). More recently, the [[Youngstown, Ohio]], region was declared part of Appalachia by the ARC due to the [[economy of Youngstown, Ohio|collapse of the steel industry in the region]] in the early 1980s and the continuing unemployment problems in the region since, though aside from [[Columbiana County, Ohio]], the Youngstown [[Designated market area#Television|DMA]] isn't traditionally or culturally considered part of the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metromonthly.wordpress.com/2007/09/01/youngstown-appalachia/ Youngstown, Appalachia? – Metro Monthly].

Retrieved 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The ARC's wide scope also grew out of the "[[pork barrel]]" phenomenon, as politicians from outside the traditional Appalachia area saw a new way to bring home federal money to their areas. However, former Ohio governor [[Bob Taft]] has stated, "What is good for Appalachia is good for all of Ohio."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arc.gov/magazine/articles.asp?ARTICLE_ID=14 Progress through Partnership: Reflections on ARC's 40th Anniversary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517060740/http://www.arc.gov/magazine/articles.asp?ARTICLE_ID=14 |date=May 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transportation has been the most challenging and expensive issue in Appalachia since the arrival of the first European settlers in the 18th century. With the exception of the October 1, 1940, opening of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]], the region's mountainous terrain continuously thwarted major federal intervention attempts at major road construction until the 1970s. This left large parts of the region virtually isolated and slowing economic growth. Before the Civil War, major cities in the region were connected via wagon roads to lowland areas, and [[flatboat]]s provided an important means for transporting goods out of the region. By 1900, railroads connected most of the region with the rest of the nation, although the poor roads made travel beyond railroad hubs difficult. When the Appalachian Regional Commission was created in 1965, road construction was considered its most important initiative, and in subsequent decades the commission spent more on road construction than all other projects combined.&lt;ref name=transeoa&gt;Burton, Mark, and Richard Hatcher, Introduction to Transportation section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 685–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effort to connect Appalachia with the outside world has required numerous civil engineering feats. Millions of tons of rock were removed to build road segments such as [[Interstate 40]] through the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee – North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] at the Tennessee-North Carolina state line and [[U.S. Route 23]] in [[Letcher County, Kentucky]]. Large tunnels were built through mountain slopes at [[Cumberland Gap Tunnel|Cumberland Gap]] to speed up travel along [[U.S. Route 25E]]. The [[New River Gorge Bridge]] in West Virginia, completed in 1977, was the longest and is now the [[List of longest arch bridge spans|fourth-longest single-arch bridge]] in the world. The Blue Ridge Parkway's [[Linn Cove Viaduct]], the construction of which required the assembly of 153 pre-cast segments {{convert|4000|ft|m}} up the slopes of [[Grandfather Mountain]],&lt;ref name=transeoa /&gt; has been designated a [[List of Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks|historic civil engineering landmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Designated Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks |url=http://www.asce.org/history/landmark/search.cfm |work=American Society of Civil Engineers |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025111447/http://www.asce.org/history/landmark/search.cfm |archivedate=October 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of Appalachia and its inhabitants in popular media are typically negative, making the region an object of humor, derision, and social concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=D. Russell |last1=Crane |first2=Tim B. |last2=Heaton |title=Handbook of Families and Poverty |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uHU5l_o3MAC&amp;pg=PA111 |year=2008 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-1-4129-5042-8 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ledford writes, "Always part of the mythical South, Appalachia continues to languish backstage in the American drama, still dressed, in the popular mind at least, in the garments of backwardness, violence, poverty, and hopelessness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Katherine |last1=Ledford |title=Back Talk from Appalachia: Confronting Stereotypes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ta0DU3ojPrUC&amp;pg=PR9 |year=2000 |publisher=Univ. Press of Kentucky |isbn=978-0-8131-9001-3 |pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otto argues that comic strips ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' by Al Capp and ''[[Barney Google]]'' by [[Billy DeBeck]], which both began in 1934, caricatured the laziness and weakness for "corn squeezin's" ([[moonshine]]) of these "hillbillies". The popular 1960s ''[[Andy Griffith Show]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' on television and [[James Dickey]]'s 1970 novel ''[[Deliverance (novel)|Deliverance]]'' perpetuated the stereotype, although the region itself underwent so many changes after 1945 that it scarcely resembles the comic images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Otto | first1 = John Solomon | year = 1986 | title = 'Hillbilly Culture': The Appalachian Mountain Folk in History and Popular Culture | url = | journal = Southern Quarterly | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 25–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (novel)|The Trail of the Lonesome Pine]]'', ''[[The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come]]'', and other early 20th-century novels of [[John Fox Jr.]], set in the Appalachian town of [[Big Stone Gap, Virginia]], and surrounding areas, gave readers an image of frontier life in Appalachia and were made into popular films. Fox himself graduated from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and was a bon vivant newspaperman in New York City. He returned home to the [[Cumberland Mountains]] of Tennessee to write his stories because of poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tucker | first1 = Edward L | year = 1972 | title = John Fox, Jr., Bon Vivant and Mountain Chronicler | url = | journal = Virginia Cavalcade | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 18–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Big Stone Gap also is the setting for the early 21st-century ''Big Stone Gap'' series by [[Adriana Trigiani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sharon B. |last1=Ewing |title=Big Stone Gap |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uGS1UNoQ7rIC |year= 2008 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |isbn=978-0-7385-5393-1 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The motion pictures ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]'' (based on the life of noted [[country music|country]] singer [[Loretta Lynn]]), ''[[Where the Lilies Bloom]]'' and ''[[Songcatcher]]'' attempt an accurate portrayal of life in Appalachia which stresses the tensions between Appalachian traditions and the values of urbanized America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Banes | first1 = Ruth A | year = 1985 | title = Mythology in Music: The Ballad of Loretta Lynn | url = | journal = Canadian Review of American Studies | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 283–300 | doi=10.3138/cras-016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Songcatcher]]'' takes place in rural Appalachia in 1907 and features the "lost" ballads of the Scots-Irish brought over in the 19th century and a musicologist's quest to preserve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Kimberley M. |last1=Holloway |title=From a race of storytellers: Essays on the ballad novels of Sharyn McCrumb |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-pyYFXY7uewC&amp;pg=PA175 |year=2003 |publisher=Mercer University Press |isbn=978-0-86554-893-0 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Stranger With A Camera]]'' is a documentary film from [[Appalshop]] about the representation of Appalachian communities by outsiders in film and video.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appalshop.org Appalshop website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1972 film ''[[Deliverance]]'' takes place in southern Appalachia. The film perpetuated extremely negative stereotypes of subhumanity.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, John. ''At Home in the Heart of Appalachia'' (2002), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Large-format]] photographer [[Shelby Lee Adams]], himself a son of Appalachian emigrants, has portrayed the Appalachian family life sympathetically in several books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Richard B. |last1=Drake |title=A History of Appalachia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9m6Zw0QY-YC&amp;pg=PT263 |year=2003 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=978-0-8131-9060-0 |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Appalachian Spring]]'' is the name of a musical composition by [[Aaron Copland]] and a ballet of the same name by [[Martha Graham]]. Copland did not intend for his music, which he composed for Graham and which incorporates [[Shaker]] melodies, to have an Appalachian theme. Graham gave the work its name; her ballet told the story of a young couple living on the frontier in western Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/specials/milestones/991027.motm.apspring.html | first1=Robert |last1=Kapilow |first2=John |last2=Adams |title=Milestones of the Millennium: "Appalachian Spring" by Aaron Copland |year=1999 |work=NPR's Performance Day |publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Alan Hovhaness]] in 1985 composed a [[tone poem]] named ''To the Appalachian Mountains'' (Symphony no. 60).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ivan |last1=March |first2=Edward |last2=Greenfield |first3=Robert |last3=Layton |first4=Paul |last4=Czajkowski |title=The Penguin Guide to Recorded Music |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-AL1AAAAMAAJ |year= 2008 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-103335-8 |page=588}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Author [[Catherine Marshall]] wrote ''[[Christy (novel)|Christy]]'', loosely based on her mother's years as a teacher in the Appalachian region. The novel was highly popular and became the basis of a [[Christy (TV series)|short-lived television series]] of the same name in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Satterwhite, Emily. ''Dear Appalachia: Readers, Identity, and Popular Fiction Since 1878'' (2011) Chapter 4, Part I&lt;/ref&gt;
* The novel ''[[Prodigal Summer]]'' by [[Barbara Kingsolver]] explores the ecology of the region and how the removal of the predators, wolves and coyotes, affected the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kingsolver | first1 = Barbara | last2 = Mendes | first2 = Guy | year = 2001 | title = Messing with the Sacred: An Interview with Barbara Kingsolver | url = | journal = Appalachian Journal | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 304–324 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some comic strips often featured Appalachia, especially "Li'l Abner" by [[Al Capp]] (1909–1979). Inge notes that this comic strip, which ran 1934–77, largely ignored religion, politics, blacks and the Civil War, but instead focused its humor on the morality of Dogpatch, examining its memorable and often eccentric people who typically relied on violence to control the social order, and held deep to their faith in land, home, self-sufficiency, and antipathy to outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Inge | first1 = M. Thomas | year = 2001 | title = Al Capp's South: Appalachian Humor in Li'l Abner | url = | journal = Studies in American Humor | volume = 3 | issue = 8| pages = 4–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold finds that starting with World War II Capp increasingly emphasized sex and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnold | first1 = Edwin T | year = 1997 | title = Abner Unpinned: Al Capp's 'Li'l Abner,' 1940–1955 | url = | journal = Appalachian Journal | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 420–436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fictional television program [[Justified (TV series)|''Justified'']] is set in the eastern hills of Kentucky in and around [[Harlan County, Kentucky|Harlan County]] and was filmed in the [[Pittsburgh]] area originally.
* "Face of Appalachia" is a song that appeared first on the album ''Tarzana Kid'' by [[John Sebastian]] in 1974. The song, co-written by Sebastian and [[Lowell George]], was described by Joel Canfield as follows: "Sebastian's lyrics weave a heart-rending picture of an old man's struggle to impart his childhood memories to his grandson; memories of places and people who no longer exist; of an era long gone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Canfield |first1=Joel |title=Ride of the Tarzana Kid |url=http://knowyourmusic.com/tag/john-sebastian/ |website=Know your music |accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cover versions of the song have been recorded by [[Valerie Carter]] (1977), [[Wendy Matthews]] (1992) and [[Julie Miller]] (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Face of Appalachia |url=https://secondhandsongs.com/work/155815 |website=SecondHandSongs |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fourth track of [[Chelsea Wolfe]]'s album ''[[Unknown Rooms: A Collection of Acoustic Songs]]'' is "Appalachia".
* Much of the popular book series ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' is set in "an area that used to be called Appalachia" which is referred to in the book as District 12. Much of the surroundings and culture reflect present-day Appalachia, such as reliance on coal mining as an industry.&lt;ref&gt;Gresh, Lois H. ''The Hunger Games Companion: The Unauthorized Guide to the Series'' (2011) p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

==='Appalachia' as the United States===

In 1839 [[Washington Irving]] proposed to rename the United States "Alleghania" or "Appalachia" in place of America, since the name belonged to [[Latin America]] too.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt; [[Edgar Allan Poe]] later took up the idea, and considered Appalachia a much better name than America or Alleghania; he thought it better defined the United States as a distinct geographical entity, separate from the rest of the Americas, and he also thought it did honor to both Irving and the natives who the Appalachian Mountains had been named after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Poe |first=Edgar Allan |editor-last=Kennedy |editor-first=Gerald |title=The Portable Edgar Allan Poe |publisher=Penguin Books |date=2006 |pages=600 |chapter=The Name of the Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, however, the United States had already reached far beyond the greater Appalachian region, but the "magnificence" of Appalachia Poe considered enough to rechristen the nation with a name that would be unique to its own character. However, Poe's popular influence only grew decades after his death, and so the name was never seriously considered.

==Physiographic provinces==

# [[Great Appalachian Valley]]
# [[Blue Ridge Mountains]]
# [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11150">In archaeology, a '''bone tool''' is a tool created from [[bone]]. A bone tool can conceivably be created from almost any bone, and in a variety of methods.

Bone tools have been documented from the advent of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and are also known from ''[[Neanderthal|Homo neanderthalensis]]'' contexts or even earlier. [[Bone]] has been used for making tools by virtually all [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, even when other materials were readily available. Any part of the skeleton can potentially be utilized; however, [[antler]]s and long bones provide some of the best working material. Long bone fragments can be shaped, by scraping against an abrasive stone, into such items as [[arrow]] and [[spear]] points, [[Sewing needle|needle]]s, [[stitching awl|awl]]s, and [[fish hook]]s.

Bone tools had mainly been made from bone splinters or were cut into a useful shape. Archaeologists are convinced that bone tools were purposefully made by deer antlers cut into shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wymer|first= John|year= 1982|title= The Paleolithic Age |publisher= Croom Helm|isbn= 9780709927105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bone was fashioned into tools such as spoons, knives, awls, pins, fish hooks, needles, flakers, hide scrapers and beamers. They made musical rasps, flutes and whistles as well as toys of bone. Decoratively carved articles were also made of bone such as hair combs, hair pins and pendants. Antler is much harder than bone and was used for flakers, points, knives and hair combs. Even the teeth and hooves did not go to waste. The teeth were drilled and used for decoration on clothing and necklaces. The hooves were also drilled and used for decoration on clothing as well as strung for rattles and bells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.susankae.com/deer%20poster.pdf |title = Deer Bone Tools |last = Nelson |first = Susan K. |year = 2009 |website = Deer Bone Tools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an [[Organic matter|organic material]], bone often does not survive in a way that is [[Archeology|archaeologically]] recoverable. However, under the right conditions, bone tools do sometimes survive and many have been recovered from locations around the world representing time periods throughout [[history]] and [[prehistory]]. Also many examples have been collected [[Ethnography|ethnographically]], and some traditional peoples, as well as [[Experimental archaeology|experimental archaeologists]], continue to use bone to make tools.

==History==
The oldest excavated bone tools are from Africa, dated to about 1.5 million years ago.{{cite needed|date=September 2018}} It is widely accepted that they appeared and developed in Africa before any other geographic region. A very famous excavation of bone tools is that of the [[Blombos Cave]] in South Africa. A collection of twenty-eight bone tools were recovered from 70 thousand year old [[Middle Stone Age]] levels at Blombos Cave. Careful analyses of these tools reveal that formal production methods were used to create [[wikt:Special:Search/awl|awls]] and [[projectile point]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Henshilwood|first= Christopher S.|last2= D'errico|first2= Francesco|last3=Marean|first3=Curtis W.|last4=Milo|first4=Richard G.|last5=Yates|first5=Royden|year= 2001|title= An early bone tool industry from the Middle Stone Age at Blombos Cave, South Africa: implications for the origins of modern human behaviour, symbolism and language|journal=Journal of Human Evolution |volume= 41|issue= 6|pages= 631–678|doi=10.1006/jhev.2001.0515|pmid= 11782112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bone tools have been discovered in the context of [[Neanderthal]] groups as well as throughout the development of [[anatomically modern human]]s. Archaeologists have long believed that Neanderthals learned how to make bone tools from modern humans and by mimicking [[stone tool]]s, viewing bone as simply another raw material. Modern humans, on the other hand, took advantage of the properties of bone and worked them into specific shapes and tools.

A recent discovery of specialized bone tools at two Neanderthal sites in southwestern France brings to light the idea that Neanderthals may have actually taught modern humans how to make specialized bone tools. The uncovering of lissoirs ("polishing stones") at these sites is significant as they are about 51,000 years old, predating the known arrival of modern humans to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Soressi|first= Marie|first2= Shannon P.| last2=McPherron|last3= Lenoir|first3= M.|last4= Dogandzic|first4= T.|last5= Goldberg|first5= P.|last6= Jacobs|first6= Z.|last7= Maigrot|first7= Y.|last8= Martisius|first8= N.

Prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]] (when machine mass production of sharp tools became viable), many everyday tools such as needles were made from bone; such items continue to be valued today as [[antique]]s.
[[Bone folder]]s are still used by [[bookbinding|bookbinders]].

==Types==

===Awls===
An awl is as a long, pointed spike generally used for piercing or marking materials such as wood or leather. Bone awls are pointed tips made on any bone splinter. Bone awls vary considerably in the amount of polish from wear, the method of preparation, and size. Bone awls tend to be classified according to the characteristics of the bone used to make the awl. Many bone awls that retain an [[epiphysis]], or rounded end of a bone. Although authors have differing theories as to the uses of bone awls, the two main uses agreed upon are as manipulators in the making of basketry and as perforators in the working of hide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Buc|first= Natacha|last2= Loponte|first2= Daniel|year= 2007|title=Methods and Interpretations in Worked Bone|url= https://www.academia.edu/739537/Bone_tool_types_and_microwear_patterns_Some_examples_from_the_Pampa_region_South_America|publisher= inapl.gov.ar|chapter= Bone tool types and microwear patterns: Some examples from the Pampa region, South America |pages= 143–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spear points and bipoints===
Bone spear points and bipoints have been found throughout the world. A mastodon rib bone found in Washington State was discovered in the 1970s with a broken bone projectile point stuck in it. Recent radiocarbon dating reveals that it is about 14,000 years old. This discovery is significant because it predates the arrival of the Clovis people, and may help rewrite human history in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Handwerk|first= Brian|year= 2011|title= Bone Deep|url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/10/pictures/111021-mastodon-bone-spear-north-american-clovis-hunting-science/|newspaper= National Geographic Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoes===
Hoes fashioned from bison [[scapula]] were common cultivating tools among the Plains Village Indians. In particular, it was used for cultivating small garden crops. It continued to be used among these Indians until iron hoes were brought by French traders in the 18th century. Recovered bone hoes range from 40&amp;nbsp;cm to as small as 15&amp;nbsp;cm. The size variation is due, in large part, to frequent resharpening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ou.edu/cas/archsur/OKArtifacts/scaphoe.htm|title= Bison Scapula Hoes|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website= OK Artifacts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical instruments===
A number of different musical instruments have been created from bone. A vulture-bone flute discovered in Europe is currently considered the world's oldest musical instrument. At about 40,000 years old, the instrument dates to the time that modern humans were settling in the area. Researchers argue that musical instruments such as this flute helped modern humans form tighter social bonds, giving them an advantage over their Neanderthal counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Owen|first= James|year= 2009|title= Bone Flute Is Oldest Instrument, Study Says|url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090624-bone-flute-oldest-instrument.html|newspaper= National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[Bones (instrument)|bones]] consist of a pair of animal bones that are played by clacking the bones together. As a musical instrument, they have a history that dates to ancient [[ancient China|China]], [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[ancient Greece|Greece]].

'''Cautelary jurisprudence''' is [[law]] made in a precautionary way prior to or outside of the normal [[Legislature|legislative enactment]]. It meant empirical, practical legal efforts aimed at solving individual cases, as distinguished from regular [[jurisprudence]] which sought to establish abstract rules under which individual cases would fall.&lt;ref&gt;Tuori, Kaius. ''Ancient Roman Lawyers and Modern Legal Ideals: Studies on the Impact of Contemporary Concerns in the Interpretation of Ancient Roman Legal History'' Vittorio Klostermann: 2007 {{ISBN|3-465-04034-1}} {{ISBN|9783465040347}}; p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Its first proponent was [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex]], who thus gave his name to the Roman designation for this kind of law, the ''[[cautio muciana]]''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Cautelary law is a tentative "procedure" used by [[lawyers]]. Initially, in [[Ancient Rome]], the idea of [[inheritance]] as being subject to conditions was not in practice. With ''cautio muciana'' it gave those who are to inherit a legacy, the ''[[legatee]]s'', a "negative authority" over something which otherwise would not have occurred until the death of the owner of the legacy, the ''[[legator]]''. It thus also makes it possible for the legator to gain promises from legatees.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The legatee provides a [[stipulatio]] or ''cautio'', promising something in return for a legacy. Thus, for example, it may be stipulated in the negative, "I agree that I can have full and exclusive use of, and live in the house, so long as I am not married."

The ''cautio muciana'' is one of a long list of legal devices invented used by the Romans to address practical situations without changes of general principles.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Cautelary jurisprudence nowadays is associated with [[inheritance law]] and the administration of [[trusts]]. The various inventions by lawyers of these new, arrangements, or forms of law, are often enacted outside of nation or state legislature, but with agreement amongst other lawyers and/or [[judge]]s. Often, many years later, such arrangements are fully enacted as a 'catching up' exercise by the legislature.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

[[File:Honoré Daumier, Bohémiens de Paris - Le claqueur, 1842.jpg|thumbnail|''Le claqueur'' by [[Honoré Daumier]], 1842.]]
A '''claque''' is an organized body of professional [[applause|applauders]] in [[France|French]] theatres and [[opera houses]]. Members of a claque are called '''claqueurs'''.

==History==
Hiring people to applaud dramatic performances was common in [[Classical antiquity|classical times]]. For example, when the [[Nero|Emperor Nero]] acted, he had his performance greeted by an [[encomium]] chanted by five thousand of his [[soldier]]s.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{cite web | date = 2002 | publisher = Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th edition (1911), Vol. 6, p. 423 | website = TheatreHistory.com | title = Claque | url = http://www.theatrehistory.com/french/claque001.html | access-date = 24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This inspired the 16th-century [[List of French-language poets|French poet]] [[Jean Daurat]] to develop the modern claque. Buying a number of tickets for a performance of one of his plays, he gave them away in return for a promise of applause. In 1820 claques underwent serious systematization when an agency in [[Paris]] opened to manage and supply claqueurs.

By 1830 the claque had become an institution. The manager of a theatre or opera house was able to send an order for any number of claqueurs. These were usually under a ''chef de claque'' (leader of applause), who judged where the efforts of the ''claqueurs'' were needed and to initiate the demonstration of approval. This could take several forms. There would be ''commissaires'' ("officers/commissioner") who learned the piece by heart and called the attention of their neighbors to its good points between the acts. ''Rieurs'' (laughers) laughed loudly at the jokes. ''Pleureurs'' (criers), generally women, feigned tears, by holding their handkerchiefs to their eyes. ''Chatouilleurs'' (ticklers) kept the audience in a good humor, while ''bisseurs'' (encore-ers) simply clapped and cried "Bis! Bis!" to request [[Encore (concert)|encores]].&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

The practice spread to Italy (famously at [[La Scala]], [[Milan]]), [[Vienna]], [[London]] ([[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]]) and [[New York City|New York]] (the [[Metropolitan Opera]]). Claques were also used as a form of [[extortion]], as [[singer]]s were commonly contacted by the ''chef de claque'' before their debut and forced to pay a fee, in order not to get [[booing|booed]].

The staging of the opera [[Tannhäuser (opera)|''Tannhäuser'']] was withdrawn by its composer, [[Richard Wagner]], from the [[Paris Opera|Parisian operatic]] repertory after the claque of the [[Jockey-Club de Paris|Jockey Club]] derisively interrupted its initial performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = Millington | editor1-first = Barry | year = 1992 | title = The Wagner compendium : a guide to Wagner's life and music | publisher = Schirmer Books | location = New York | ISBN = 9780028713595 | page = 281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grey | first = Thomas S. | year = 2013 | chapter = Tannhäuser, Paris scandal of 1861 | pages = 581–583 | editor1-last = Vazsonyi | editor-first = Nicholas | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, England | ISBN = 9781107004252 | title = The Cambridge Wagner Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later [[Toscanini]] and [[Mahler]] discouraged claques, as a part of the development of [[concert etiquette]].

Although the practice mostly died out in Europe during the mid-20th century, instances of actors paid to applaud at performances still appear today, most famously with the [[Bolshoi Ballet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barry |first=Ellen |title=Wild Applause, Secretly Choreographed |newspaper=The New York Times |date=14 August 2013

==Post Democracy==

Crouch coined the term "[[post-democracy]]" in 2000 in his book ''Coping with Post-Democracy''. It designates [[State (polity)|states]] that are conducted by fully operating [[Democracy|democratic system]]s (elections are being held, governments fall and there is [[freedom of speech]]), but whose application is progressively limited. A small elite is making the tough decisions and co-opts the democratic institutions. Crouch developed the idea in an article called ''Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?''&lt;ref&gt;Colin Crouch. [http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=3997&amp;title=Is+there+a+liberalism+beyond+social+democracy%3f Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?] [[Policy Network]] , 5 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[think tank]] [[Policy Network]] and in his subsequent book ''The Strange Non-Death of Neo-Liberalism''. The term appeared to define a running evolution within democracies during the 21st century and is [[polemic]]al because it calls attention to recognized democracies losing some of their foundations and evolving towards an [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] regime.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

{{update|date=February 2015}}
{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}

'''Constitution Park''' was a 2005 proposal to pursue [[eminent domain]] against the [[Plainfield, New Hampshire]] vacation estate of Supreme Court Justice [[Stephen Breyer]], in order to construct a park commemorating the US and New Hampshire Constitutions and providing an interpretive center and lodging for visitors. It came in response to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Orlando Sentinel'': Libertarians propose seizure of justice's home for park.  July 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Concord Monitor'': [https://web.archive.org/web/20051004002157/http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050729%2FREPOSITORY%2F507290346%2F1037%2FNEWS04 Court foes target Breyer's property.]  July 29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the similar [[Lost Liberty Hotel]], the park's proponents, namely former LPNH Vice-Chair [[Mike Lorrey]], the [[Libertarian Party of New Hampshire]], and the [[Coalition of New Hampshire Taxpayers]], advocate that the Kelo decision be used to improve the local tax base, expand economic opportunities in the community, which are "public purposes" under the wording of Kelo. Unlike the Lost Liberty Hotel, the Constitution Park would be a non-profit entity and open to the public for free, and so fits in more of a grey area between private for-profit use (as in the Hotel proposal as well as New London's plans) and strictly public ownership (as in roads, bridges, and other historically proper examples of the commonly accepted purpose of eminent domain).

The Constitution Park proposal was published in newspapers, media websites, and broadcast on television and radio. Apparently, the LPNH and CNHT had been planning a similar proposal for Justice Souter's property in [[Weare, NH]], when they were scooped and co-opted by [[Logan Darrow Clements]] and his hotel proposal. When Mike Lorrey found that Breyer owned a significant estate in Plainfield (over {{convert|4500|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} in the main house, multiple buildings, and over {{convert|100|acre|km2}} of land, as well as another {{convert|100|acre|km2}} of adjacent property in Chloe Breyer's name), the proposal was adapted to pursue Breyer's property.

Additional questions were raised when comparisons of the property tax evaluation of the Breyer estate with similar adjacent properties showed that Breyer enjoys a valuation less than half that of his neighbors (according to Plainfield Town Clerk's office).

==Subsequent History==
New Hampshire [[New Hampshire General Court|legislators]], in response to calls by Lorrey, Clements, and LPNH gubernatorial candidate [[Rich Kahn]], passed a proposed state constitutional amendment that will limit eminent domain in the state to property which will be strictly owned by government entities. This amendment was approved by voters (with 85.7% voting in favor) in the November 2006 general election.&lt;ref&gt;http://ballotpedia.org/New_Hampshire_Question_1,_Eminent_Domain_(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[crucifix]] of Ferdinand and Sancha''' ({{lang-es|crucifijo de don Fernando y doña Sancha}}) is an [[ivory carving]] from ''circa'' 1063, today in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]. It was part of an offering by King [[Ferdinand I of León]] and [[Sancha of León|Queen Sancha]] to furnish the basilica of [[San Isidoro de León]]. It is the earliest known crucifix from Spain depicting the [[body of Christ]]. Although earlier Spanish crucifices of gold, ivory and wood are known, they are all without images. The official inventory of the royal gift describes the crucifix as "a cross of ivory with the image of our crucified Redeemer".&lt;ref&gt;Gómez-Moreno (1947), 162.&lt;/ref&gt; It measures 52&amp;nbsp;cm high, 34.5&amp;nbsp;cm wide, and 1&amp;nbsp;cm thick, with the width of the cross beams being 7&amp;nbsp;cm. The image of Christ is 305&amp;nbsp;mm tall.

The figure of Christ is shown with its heading reclining to the left, its large eyes wide open and encrusted with [[Jet (lignite)|jet]], and sporting a beard and moustache. (Jet eyes were common at the time in ivory sculptures of the region.) Each foot is shown nailed individually to the cross. The fingers of Christ's right hand are missing. His ''perizonium'' (loin cloth) covers him to the knees and is tied at his waist. The legs and torso are perfectly vertical. There is a small space behind the body so the piece could serve as a [[reliquary]], as was typical.

On the obverse of the cross are intertwined images of plants and animals, and of humans either ascending to paradise or descending to hell. Above the image of Christ is the inscription:
&lt;center&gt;IHSNAZA&lt;br&gt;RENUSREX&lt;br&gt;IUDEORU&lt;/center&gt;
which transaltes "[[INRI|Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews]]", the citation placed on the cross according to the [[Four Gospels]]. Above the inscription on the ivory is a representation of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected Christ]] carrying a cross. At the base of the cross, below the crucified figure, is a figure of [[Adam]], and below that the inscription:
&lt;center&gt;FREDINANDUSREX&lt;br&gt;SANCIAREGINA&lt;/center&gt;
indicating the commissioners of the work, King Ferdinand and Queen Sancha. The reverse of the cross bears plant figures, in the centre the [[Agnus Dei]], and at the four extremities of the arms the symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]].

'''Jewish Disabilities''' were legal restrictions, limitations and obligations placed on [[European Jews]] in the [[Middle Ages]], somewhat analogous to [[History of the Jews under Muslim rule|those imposed on Jews in the Muslim world]]. In Europe, the disabilities imposed on Jews included provisions requiring Jews to wear specific and identifying clothing such as the [[Jewish hat]] and the [[yellow badge]], paying [[Jewish tax|special taxes]], swearing [[Jewish oath|special oaths]], living certain [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|neighbourhoods]], and forbidding Jews to enter certain [[Trade (occupation)|trades]] (for example selling new clothes in medieval Sweden).  Disabilities also included special taxes levied on Jews, exclusion from public life, restraints on the performance of religious ceremonies, and linguistic censorship. Some countries went even further and outright [[Expulsions and exoduses of Jews|expelled Jews]], for example [[Edict of Expulsion|England]] in 1290 (Jews were readmitted in 1655) and [[Expulsion of the Jews from Spain|Spain]] in 1492 (readmitted in 1868).

The disabilities began to be lifted with [[Jewish emancipation]] in the late 18th and the 19th century. In 1791, [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]] was the first country to abolish disabilities altogether, followed by [[Prussia]] in 1848. [[Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom]] was achieved in 1858 after an almost 30-year struggle championed by [[Isaac Lyon Goldsmid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/237923/Sir-Isaac-Lyon-Goldsmid-1st-Baronet#ref213807 |title=Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, 1st Baronet| publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the ability of Jews to sit in parliament with the passing of the [[Jews Relief Act 1858]].  The newly united [[German Empire]] in 1871 abolished Jewish disabilities in Germany.

The first Jewish settlers in North America arrived in the Dutch colony of [[New Amsterdam]] in 1654. They were forbidden to hold public office, open a retail shop, or establish a synagogue.  When the colony was seized by the British in 1664 Jewish rights remained unchanged, but by 1671 [[Asser Levy]] was the first Jew to serve on a jury in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/amsterdam.html |title=New Amsterdam's Jewish Crusader |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[History of the Jews in Russia#Russian Empire|Russian Empire]] Jewish disabilities were completely abolished after the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, in which Jews had a prominent role. Soviet Russia had the largest population of Jews in the whole of Europe. However, extralegal [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|antisemitic feelings and policies remained]].

[[File:Doggerland3er en.png|thumb|360px|European coastline: modern (left), during the early Holocene (center) and during the LGM (right).]]
The '''early Holocene sea level rise''' (EHSLR) was a significant jump in [[Past sea level|sea level]]
by about {{val|60|u=m}} during the early [[Holocene]], between about 12,000 and 7,000 years ago, spanning the Eurasian [[Mesolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;D.E.Smith, S.Harrison, C.R.Firth, J.T.Jordan, "The early Holocene sea level rise", ''Quaternary Science Reviews'', Volume 30, Issues 15–16, July 2011, Pages 1846-1860.
"The rise, of ca 60m, took place over most of the Earth as the volume of the oceans increased during deglaciation and is dated at 11,650–7000 cal. BP. The EHSLR was largely driven by meltwater release from decaying ice masses and the break up of coastal ice streams. [...] The impact of the EHSLR on climate is reviewed and it is maintained that the event was a factor in the 8200 BP cooling event, as well as in changes in ocean current patterns and their resultant effects. The EHSLR may also have enhanced volcanic activity, but no clear evidence of a causal link with submarine sliding on continental slopes and shelves can yet be demonstrated. The rise probably influenced rates and patterns of human migrations and cultural changes."
&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid rise in sea level and associated [[climate change]], notably the [[8.2 kiloyear event|8.2 ka cooling event]],
and the loss of coastal land favoured by [[Neolithic Revolution|early farmers]], may have contributed to the spread of the Neolithic to [[Neolithic Europe|Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris S.M.Turney, Heidi Brown, "Catastrophic early Holocene sea level rise, human migration and the Neolithic transition in Europe", ''Quaternary Science Reviews'', Volume 26, Issues 17–18, September 2007, Pages 2036-2041.&lt;/ref&gt;

During deglaciation since the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], between about 20,000 to 7,000 years ago (20&amp;ndash;7 ka), sea level rose 
by a total of about 100&amp;nbsp;m, at times at extremely high rates, due to the rapid melting of the [[Irish Sea Glacier|British-Irish Sea]], [[Weichselian glaciation|Fennoscandian]], [[Laurentide ice sheet|Laurentide]], [[Barents–Kara Ice Sheet|Barents-Kara]], [[Patagonian Ice Sheet|Patagonian]], [[Wisconsin glaciation|Innuitian]] and parts of the [[Antarctic ice sheet|Antarctic]] ice sheets. 
At the onset of deglaciation about 19 ka, a brief, at most 500-year long, glacio-eustatic event may have contributed as much as 10 m to sea level with an average rate of about 20&amp;nbsp;mm/yr. 
During the rest of the early Holocene, the rate of sea level rise varied from a low of about 6.0–9.9 &amp;nbsp;mm/yr to as high as 30–60 &amp;nbsp;mm/yr during brief periods of accelerated sea level rise.&lt;ref name="Cronin2012a"&gt;Cronin, T. M. (2012) ''Invited review: Rapid sea-level rise.'' Quaternary Science Reviews. 56:11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchon2011a"&gt;Blanchon, P. (2011a) ''Meltwater Pulses.'' In: Hopley, D. (Ed), ''Encyclopedia of Modern Coral Reefs: Structure, form and process.'' Springer-Verlag Earth Science Series, p. 683-690. {{ISBN|978-90-481-2638-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solid geological evidence, based largely upon analysis of deep cores of [[Coral reef|coral reefs]], exists only for three major periods of accelerated sea level rise, called ''meltwater pulses'', during the last deglaciation.
The first, [[Meltwater pulse 1A]], lasted between c. 14.6&amp;ndash;14.3&amp;nbsp;ka,  a 13.5 m rise over about 290 years centered at 14.2&amp;nbsp;ka.

The EHSLR spans Meltwater pulses 1B and 1C, between 12,000 and 7,000 years ago:
*[[Meltwater pulse 1B]] between c. 11.4&amp;ndash;11.1&amp;nbsp;ka, a 7.5 m rise over about 160 years centered at 11.1&amp;nbsp;ka,  which includes the [[Younger Dryas]] interval  of reduced sea level rise at about 6.0–9.9 &amp;nbsp;mm/yr;
*Meltwater pulse 1C between c. [[8.2 kiloyear event|8.2]]&amp;ndash;7.6&amp;nbsp;ka, centered at [[60th century BC|8.0&amp;nbsp;ka]], a rise of 6.5 m in less than 140 years.&lt;ref name="Blanchon2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchon2011b"&gt;Blanchon, P. (2011b) ''Backstepping.'' In: Hopley, D. (Ed), ''Encyclopedia of Modern Coral Reefs: Structure, form and process.'' Springer-Verlag Earth Science Series, p. 77-84. {{ISBN|978-90-481-2638-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BlanchonOthers1995a"&gt;Blanchon, P., and Shaw, J. (1995) ''Reef drowning during the last deglaciation: evidence for catastrophic sea-level rise and icesheet collapse.'' Geology, 23:4–8.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Such rapid rates of sea level rising during [[meltwater]] events clearly implicate major ice-loss events related to ice sheet collapse. The primary source may have been meltwater from the Antarctic ice sheet. Other studies suggest a Northern Hemisphere source for the meltwater in the Laurentide ice sheet.&lt;ref name="BlanchonOthers1995a" /&gt;

[[File:BlackMarble20161km.jpg|thumb|300px|Earth at night in 2016, in a high-resolution [[compositing|composite image]] taken from space&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/new-night-lights-maps-open-up-possible-real-time-applications&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Earth observation''' ('''EO''') is the gathering of information about the physical, chemical, and [[biosphere|biological]] systems of the [[planet]] via [[remote sensing|remote-sensing]] technologies, supplemented by [[Earth]]-surveying techniques, which encompasses the collection, analysis, and presentation of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation |title=Aims and Scope |url=http://www.journals.elsevier.com/international-journal-of-applied-earth-observation-and-geoinformation/ |publisher=Elsevier |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth observation is used to monitor and assess the status of and changes in [[natural environment|natural]] and [[built environment]]s.

In recent years,{{when|date=January 2017}} &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tomás|first=Roberto|last2=Li|first2=Zhenhong|date=2017-02-24|title=Earth Observations for Geohazards: Present and Future Challenges|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs9030194|journal=Remote Sensing|volume=9|issue=3|pages=194|doi=10.3390/rs9030194|issn=2072-4292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth observation has become technologically sophisticated increasingly. It has also become more important due to the [[human impact on the environment|dramatic impact]] that modern human [[civilization]] is having on the [[world]] and the need to minimize negative effects (e.g. [[geohazard]]s&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tomás |first1=Roberto |last2=Li |first2=Zhenhong |date=2017-02-24 |title=Earth Observations for Geohazards: Present and Future Challenges |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/3/194 |journal=Remote Sensing |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=194 |doi=10.3390/rs9030194}}&lt;/ref&gt;), along with the opportunities such observation provides to improve social and economic well-being.

The term ''Earth observation'' is used in two ways, leading to confusion. In Europe, in particular, it has often been used to refer to satellite-based remote sensing, but the term is also used to refer to any form of observations of the Earth system, including in situ and airborne observations, for example. The Group on Earth Observations, which has over 100 member countries and over 100 participating organizations, uses EO in this broader sense.

To add to the confusion, in the US, for example, the term ''remote sensing'' is often used to refer to satellite-based remote sensing, but sometimes used more broadly for observations using any form of remote sensing technology, including airborne sensors and even ground-based sensors such as cameras. Perhaps the least ambiguous term to use for satellite-based sensors is ''satellite remote sensing'', or SRS, an acronym which is gradually starting to appear in the literature.

Earth observations may include:
* numerical measurements taken by a [[thermometer]], [[anemometer|wind gauge]], ocean [[buoy]], [[altimeter]] or [[seismometer]]
* photos and radar or sonar images taken from ground or ocean-based instruments
* photos and radar images taken from remote-sensing satellites
* decision-support tools based on processed information, such as maps and models 

Just as Earth observations consist of a wide variety of possible elements, they can be applied to a wide variety of possible uses. Some of the specific applications of Earth observations are:
* [[weather forecasting|forecasting weather]]
* tracking [[biodiversity]] and [[wildlife]] trends
* measuring land-use change (such as [[deforestation]])
* monitoring and responding to [[natural disaster]]s&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, including fires, [[flood]]s, [[earthquake]]s, landslides, land subsidence and [[tsunami]]s&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* managing [[natural resource]]s, such as [[energy]], [[freshwater]] and [[agriculture]]
* addressing emerging diseases and other health risks
* predicting, adapting to and mitigating [[climate change]] 

The quality and quantity of Earth observations continue to mount rapidly. In addition to the ongoing launch of new remote-sensing satellites, increasingly sophisticated in situ instruments located on the ground, on balloons and airplanes, and in rivers, lakes and oceans, are generating increasingly comprehensive, nearly real-time observations.

The '''Esperanza Stone''' was a large (8-feet long) inscribed stone found in the valley of the [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]], Mexico. It was discovered and excavated in 1909 by [[Frederick Russell Burnham|Major F. R. Burnham]] and [[Charles Frederick Holder]].  [[File:Esperanza stone 1909.JPG|right|thumb|250px|''Esperanza Stone''.  [[Frederick Russell Burnham|Major F. R. Burnham]] (left), Holder (right), Yaqui Delta, Sonora, Mexico, 1909.]]

==Discovery==

The stone was discovered during an expedition in the Yaqui valley.

==Description==

The stone was "a brown, igneous rock, its longest axis about eight feet, and on the eastern face, which had an angle of about forty-five degrees, was the deep-cut inscription."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fort|first=Charles Hoy|title=The Book of the Damned|chapterurl=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_Damned/Chapter_11|year=1919|page=145|chapter=chapter 11}} citing {{cite journal|last=Holder|first=Charles F.|date=Sep 10, 1910|journal=[[Scientific American]]|issn=0036-8733|page=196|title=The Esperanza Stone}} (complete [http://atlantisforschung.de/index.php?title=The_Esperanza_Stone article online]; retrieved 03 Jan. 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols on the stone include a [[volute]] and a [[swastika]], also found on other stones in Mexico.

==Legend==

There was a legend that the stone had fallen down out of heaven in times past, and that the carving was by human hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discord.org/~lippard/wilson-review.html|title=Review of The New Inquisition|last=Lippard|first=Jim|accessdate=25 January 2011|quote=Many years ago a strange stone resembling a meteorite fell into the valley of the Yaqui, Mexico, and the sensational story went from one end to the other of the country that a stone bearing human inscriptions had descended to earth. Hundreds visited the place, natives made a pilgrimage to it from all over Sonora, and the stone, called the Esperanza, became famous in its way, and many of the inhabitants believe that it is a message from heaven, and demand that it be translated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning of the symbols==

Burnham believed that the symbols were Mayan. Others class them as [[Petroglyph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brighthub.com/education/languages/articles/102850.aspx|title=About the Native American Indian Pictorial Language|last=Neas|first=Linda M.

'''Frankie Hewitt''' (née '''Teague'''; June 17, 1931 – February 28, 2003) was an American theater producer and founder of the [[Ford's Theatre Society]], responsible for restoring and reopening the historic site as a working theater. 

==Early life and career==
{{unsourced|section|date=December 2016}}
Born '''Frankie Teague''' in [[Roger Mills County, Oklahoma]], she was women's editor of the ''[[Napa Daily Register]]'' from 1949-51 and later worked for the [[California Institute for Social Welfare]] (1954-55), the [[National Institute for Social Welfare]] (1956-58), the [[US Senate]] [[Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency]] (1959-61), and the US mission to the [[United Nations]] (1961-63) under Ambassador [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]].  

She founded the Ford's Theatre society in 1967 and the theater reopened with a production of ''[[John Brown's Body (poem)|John Brown's Body]]'' by [[Stephen Vincent Benet]] on February 12, 1968. She produced over 150 stage shows and more than 15 network television specials broadcast from the theater. For her work with the theater she was awarded a 2002 [[National Humanities Medal]].  

==Personal life==
Her second marriage was to ''[[60 Minutes]]'' producer [[Don Hewitt]] until their divorce in 1974. She had two daughters: Lisa Gabrielle Hewitt Cassara, a coordinating producer of the syndicated television show "[[A Current Affair (U.S. TV series)|A Current Affair]]", and Jilian Childers Hewitt, from her first marriage to Bob Childers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/business/media/20hewitt.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_moc.semityn.www New York Times: "Don Hewitt, Creator of ‘60 Minutes’, Dies at 86"], August 19, 2009; accessed December 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
She died at her home in [[Kensington, Maryland]] from cancer, aged 71.

As a result, freedoms usually include rights which are usually recognized (often, not always, in an unconditional manner) by the government (and access to which is theoretically enforced against any and all interferences).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12569">'''Geovisualization''' or '''Geovisualisation''', short for ''Geographic Visualization'', refers to a set of tools and techniques supporting the analysis of [[geospatial data]] through the use of [[interactive visualization]].

Like the related fields of [[scientific visualization]]&lt;ref name= "ME97"&gt;MacEachren, A.M. and Kraak, M.J. 1997 Exploratory cartographic visualization: advancing the agenda. Computers &amp; Geosciences, 23(4), pp. 335-343.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[information visualization]] &lt;ref name= "Card99"&gt;[[Stuart K. Card]], Mackinlay, J.D., and Shneidermann, B. 1999. Reading in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think. San Francisco: Morgan Kaumann Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  geovisualization emphasizes knowledge construction over knowledge storage or information transmission.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt; To do this, geovisualization communicates geospatial information in ways that, when combined with human understanding, allow for data exploration and decision-making processes.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiang2005"&gt;Jiang, B., and Li, Z. 2005. Editorial: Geovisualization: Design, Enhanced Visual Tools and Applications. The Cartographic Journal, 42(1), pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "ME04"&gt;[[Alan MacEachren|MacEachren, A.M.]] 2004. Geovisualization for knowledge construction and decision support. IEEE computer graphics and applications, 24(1), pp.13-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional, static maps have a limited exploratory capability; the graphical representations are inextricably linked to the geographical information beneath. [[GIS]] and geovisualization allow for more interactive maps; including the ability to explore different layers of the map, to zoom in or out, and to change the visual appearance of the map, usually on a computer display.&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"&gt;Jiang, B., Huang, B., and Vasek, V. 2003. Geovisualisation for Planning Support Systems. In Planning Support Systems in Practice, Geertman, S., and Stillwell, J. (Eds.). Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Geovisualization represents a set of cartographic technologies and practices that take advantage of the ability of modern microprocessors to render changes to a map in real time, allowing users to adjust the mapped data on the fly.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt;

==History==
The term visualization is first mentioned in the cartographic literature at least as early as 1953, in an article by [[University of Chicago]] geographer Allen K. Philbrick. New developments in the field of computer science prompted the [[National Science Foundation]] to redefine the term in a 1987 report which placed visualization at the convergence of computer graphics, image processing, computer vision, computer-aided design, signal processing, and user interface studies &lt;ref&gt;McCormick, B.H., DeFanti, T.A., and Brown, M.D. (Eds.). 1987. Visualization in Scientific Computing. Computer Graphics, 21(6). p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasized both the knowledge creation and hypothesis generation aspects of scientific visualization.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt;

Geovisualization developed as a field of research in the early 1980s, based largely on the work of French graphic theorist [[Jacques Bertin]].&lt;ref name= "ME04"/&gt; Bertin’s work on cartographic design and information visualization share with the National Science Foundation report a focus on the potential for the use of “dynamic visual displays as prompts for scientific insight and on the methods through which dynamic visual displays might leverage perceptual cognitive processes to facilitate scientific thinking”.&lt;ref name= "ME04"/&gt;

Geovisualization has continued to grow as a subject of practice and research. The [[International Cartographic Association]] (ICA) established a Commission on Visualization &amp; Virtual Environments in 1995.

==Related Fields==
Geovisualization is closely related to other visualization fields, such as [[scientific visualization]]&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt; and [[information visualization]].&lt;ref name= "Card99"/&gt; Owing to its roots in [[cartography]], geovisualization contributes to these other fields by way of the map metaphor, which “has been widely used to visualize non-geographic information in the domains of information visualization and [[domain knowledge]] visualization."&lt;ref name="Jiang2005"/&gt;  It is also related to [[UrbanSim|urban simulation]].

==Practical Applications==
Geovisualization has made inroads in a diverse set of real-world situations calling for the decision-making and knowledge creation processes it can provide. The following list provides a summary of some of these applications as they are discussed in the geovisualization literature.
E

=== Wildland fire fighting ===
Firefighters have been using sandbox environments to rapidly and physically model topography and fire for wildfire incident command strategic planning. The SimTable is a 3D interactive fire simulator, bringing sandtable exercises to life. The SimTable uses advanced computer simulations to model fires in any area, including local neighborhoods, utilizing actual slope, terrain, wind speed/direction, vegetation, and other factors. SimTable Models were used in Arizona's largest fire on record, the [[Wallow Fire]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kob.com/article/stories/S2149915.shtml?cat=0&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forestry ===
Geovisualizers, working with European foresters, used CommonGIS and Visualization Toolkit ([[VTK]]) to visualize a large set of spatio-temporal data related to European forests, allowing the data to be explored by non-experts over the Internet. The report summarizing this effort “uncovers a range of fundamental issues relevant to the broad field of geovisualization and information visualization research”.&lt;ref name= "GA07"&gt;Andrienko, G., Andrienko, N., Jankowski, P, Keim, D., Kraak, M.-J., MacEachren, A.M., and Wrobel, S. 2007. Geovisual analytics for spatial decision support: Setting the research agenda. International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 21(8), pp. 839-857.&lt;/ref&gt;

The research team cited the two major problems as the inability of the geovisualizers to convince the foresters of the efficacy of geovisualization in their work and the foresters’ misgivings over the dataset’s accessibility to non-experts engaging in “uncontrolled exploration”. While the geovisualizers focused on the ability of geovisualization to aid in knowledge construction, the foresters preferred the information-communication role of more traditional forms of cartographic representation.&lt;ref name= "GA07"/&gt;

===Archaeology===
Geovisualization provides archaeologists with a potential technique for mapping unearthed archaeological environments  as well as for accessing and exploring archaeological data in three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Watters, M. 2005. Geovisualization: an Example from the Catholme Ceremonial Complex. Archaeological Prospection, 13, pp. 282-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

The implications of geovisualization for archaeology are not limited to advances in archaeological theory and exploration but also include the development of new, collaborative relationships between archaeologists and computer scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Watters, M. 2005. Review of Exploring Geovisualization , Dykes, J., MacEachren, A.M., and Kraak, M.J. (Eds.). Amsterdam: Elsevier Science, 2004. In Archaeological Prospection, 12, pp. 265-266.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Studies===
Geovisualization tools provide multiple stakeholders with the ability to make balanced environmental decisions by taking into account “the complex interacting factors that should be taken into account when studying environmental changes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gasco|first=Luis|last2=Asensio|first2=Cesar|last3=de Arcas|first3=Guillermo|date=2017-05-15|title=Communicating airport noise emission data to the general public|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717303042|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=586|pages=836–848|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.02.063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geovisualization users can use a [[georeference]]d model to explore a complex set of environmental data, interrogating a number of scenarios or policy options to determine a best fit.&lt;ref&gt;Danada, J., Dias, E., Romao, T., Correia, N., Trabuco, A., Santos, C., Serpa, J., Costa, M., Camara, A. 2005. Mobile Environmental Visualization. The Cartographic Journal, 42(1), pp. 61-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban Planning===
Both planners and the general public can use geovisualization to explore real-world environments and model ‘what if’ scenarios based on spatio-temporal data. While geovisualization in the preceding fields may be divided into two separate domains—the private domain, in which professionals use geovisualization to explore data and generate hypotheses, and the public domain, in which these professionals present their “visual thinking” to the general public&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"/&gt;—planning relies more heavily than many other fields on collaboration between the general public and professionals.

Planners use geovisualization as a tool for modeling the environmental interests and policy concerns of the general public. Jiang et al.&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"/&gt; mention two examples, in which “3D photorealistic representations are used to show urban redevelopment [and] dynamic computer simulations are used to show possible pollution diffusion over the next few years.” The widespread use of the Internet by the general public has implications for these collaborative planning efforts, leading to increased participation by the public while decreasing the amount of time it takes to debate more controversial planning decisions.&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"/&gt;

'''''How to Survive''''' is a [[survival horror]] [[action role-playing]] video game developed by French studio EKO Software and published by [[505 Games]]. It was released on October 23, 2013 for [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[PlayStation 4]] and it was released in June 2014 for the [[Nintendo eShop]].

==Gameplay==
''How to Survive'' is played from a top-down perspective. There are two game modes, story and challenge, and both can be played with up to two players. Challenge mode puts the player(s) on one side of the island, and they must get to the other side, where their getaway vehicle awaits. The player's mission is to gather materials, craft weapons, and make it off the island without dying. Neither challenge or story are timed, and therefore, the player can take as long as they want.

==Plot==
Players play as one of three survivors - the all rounded Kenji, the fast, arczar Abbie or the brawling Jack - shipwrecked on one of four zombie-infested islands that form an archipelago. After finding food for another wounded survivor, Andrew (who has already suffered a zombie bite), the survivor meets a one-legged old man named Ramon who owns a boat that can be used to travel between the islands. Together, they hatch a plan to escape the archipelago using a beached seaplane, with Andrew as the pilot. Ramon sends the survivor to fetch materials to repair the plane.

The survivor soon meets Kovac, a mysterious man in full armor who has made the islands his personal hunting ground. A self-proclaimed master survivor, Kovac is using his extensive field experience to write a zombie survival guide ('Kovac's Rules'), and gladly assumes a mentor role, helping the survivor with valuable advice and tools throughout the course of the game.

On the search, the survivor meets a woman named Carol whose young daughter, Emily, got separated from her. The survivor locates Emily, stranded on a cliffside, but is unable to save her from falling into the sea and getting swept away; Carol is devastated by the news. The plane is repaired, but Ramon realizes Andrew is (obviously) in no condition to pilot it and sends the survivor in search of someone who can.

The survivor meets a senile old woman, Martha, who is missing her companion Enzo (who turns out to be a cat). After retrieving Enzo, the survivor learns from her of a drunken former airplane pilot named Sanchez who lives nearby. Sanchez turns out to be a drug smuggler who lost all his cargo when his plane crashed, and the survivor is forced to comb the entire archipelago for his scattered packages to secure his cooperation.

Along the way, the survivor finds Emily alive, but imprisoned, and frees her, reuniting her with Carol. The girl claims she was taken prisoner by a strange man whose face she never saw; her testimony, added to Carol's accusation of the same man being responsible for guiding the ship she was on onto the reefs, makes it evident that Kovac is not all he seems after all.

The survivor eventually gathers Sanchez, Carol, and Emily by the repaired seaplane. Sanchez wants to leave at once, but the survivor insists they fetch Ramon as well. However, not far from the plane the survivor is instead confronted by Kovac, who shows his true colors, claiming he does not want the survivor to leave as they have 'not finished their training'. He then sets the survivor a 'final exam' by attracting a massive zombie horde, which will have to be fought off while the plane starts up. Finally, after a grueling battle, the survivor manages to escape back to the plane, and it takes off with Kovac calling through a loudspeaker for the survivor to 'come back'.

The game ends with Kovac causing another shipwreck by misguiding a ship over the radio, just as he did with the player's in the beginning. He then calls an accomplice, stating that a "new shipment of recruits" has arrived, and the accomplice answers with ''"Copy, amigo. I'm in position. Ready to play another round?".'' It is then seen that the accomplice is none other than the old cripple, Ramon.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=June 2018}}

''How to Survive'' received mixed reviews upon release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/how-to-survive|title=How to Survive for PC reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{split|How to Survive 2|date=June 2018}}

''How To Survive - Third Person Standalone'' was announced on June 4, 2015. It is an expansion pack in which players play the game in a third-person perspective, as opposed to the top-down perspective of the original ''How to Survive''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/how-to-survive-third-person-standalone-announcemen/2300-6425132/|title=How To Survive - Third Person Standalone Announcement Trailer|first=Marco|last=Martinez|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=June 4, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sequel, ''How to Survive 2'' was announced on August 28, 2015. It features enhanced graphics and an expanded home base camp and crafting system. It was set in [[New Orleans]] and it was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s [[early access]] in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2015/08/28/how-to-survive-2-adds-four-player-co-op-headed-to-early-access-in-october/|title=How to Survive 2 adds four-player co-op, headed to Early Access in October|first=Brenna|last=Hillier|work=[[VG247]]|date=August 28, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Howard Lawson''' (September 25, 1894 – August 11, 1977) was an American writer.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', August 17, 1977, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt; He was for several years head of the Hollywood division of the [[Communist Party USA]]. He was also the organization's cultural manager and answered directly to [[V.J. Jerome]], the Party's New York-based cultural chief. He was the first president of the [[Writers Guild of America, West]] after the [[Screen Writers Guild]] divided into two regional organizations.

Lawson was one of the [[Hollywood Ten]], the first group of American film industry professionals to be [[blacklist]]ed during the 1950s McCarthy era.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Lawson was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref name=Shtetl&gt;{{cite book|url=http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=purduepress_previews|first=Vincent|last=Brook|title=From Shtetl to Stardom: Jews and Hollywood: Chapter 1: Still an Empire of Their Own: How Jews Remain Atop a Reinvented Hollywood|pages=17 |publisher=Purdue University Press|date=December 15, 2016|ISBN=9781557537638}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New York City, New York]] on September 25, 1894 to Simeon Levy and Belle Hart Lawson. His father changed their name from Levy to Lawson before his son was born, joking that this was so that his son could "obtain reservations at expensive resort hotels".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Hara|2000|loc=1-375}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was five, his mother died. She had named her children after people she admired: John Howard Lawson was named after the prison reformer [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]], his sister Adelaide Jaffery Lawson was named after a friend of hers who was socially active, and Wendell Holmes Lawson was named after reforming American jurist [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]

===Education===
After Simeon's wife died, he would take control of the children's education: first to Halstead School in [[Yonkers, New York]] and then [[Cutler School (New York)]] in [[New Rochelle, New York]]. In 1906, Simeon sent the three children on a tour of Europe, and seeing theatre was on the list. John Howard would take notes on the set designs, actors, and plays. In 1909, they were sent on a tour of America and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Hara|2000|loc=1-375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age seven, he attended Elizabeth and Alexis Ferms' "Children's Playhouse" school, an experimental school for children.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul.  ''The Modern School Movement'', Princeton University Press, 1980, 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

After studying at [[Williams College]] (1910–1914) and graduating with a B.A., he became a successful writer with plays such as ''Standards'' (1916) and ''Servant-Master-Lover'' (1916). While there, his brother was in Germany studying music and art. Works of [[Karl Kautsky]] struck him because of his sense of alienation. He was not only a contributor to ''The Williams College Monthly'', but also an editor of the senior-class book and a member of the varsity debating team. He was known to other students as a good-natured iconoclast and a frequent speaker at undergraduate meetings. After graduating, he would become an editor at [[Reuters]] from 1914-1915.

===Early career===
His first piece, ''A Hindoo Love Drama'' was written while at Williams. Mary Kirkpatrick, who was the head of the Williams College Drama Club, was impressed by this effort. That confidence inspired him to write three plays in 1915-1916: ''Standards'', ''The Spice of Life'', and ''Servant-Master-Lover''.

''Standards'' was bought by [[George M. Cohan]] and Sam Harris and was given a tryout in Albany and Syracuse in 1915. It never made it to Broadway. [[Oliver Morosco]] produced ''Servant-Master-Lover'' in a run in Los Angeles, but to bad reviews.

===World War I===
When the [[United States]] entered [[World War I]] in 1917, he was opposed to joining. His father helped him to get a position in the [[American Volunteer Motor Ambulance Corps|Norton-Harjes Volunteer Ambulance Corps]]. In June 1917, he left for the war and aboard the ship he met [[John Dos Passos]]. In November, when Norton-Hayes folded into the [[American Red Cross]]'s Ambulance Service, Dos Passos and Lawson decided to become drivers and they left for Italy. At this time, Dos Passos was working on ''One Man's Initiation: 1917'' and Lawson on ''Roger Bloomer''. While serving, they were outfitted to Paris where Lawson went to the [[Comédie-Française]] and [[Sergey Diaghilev]]'s ballet troupe. In January 1918, Dos Passos wrote a letter that was critical of the ambulance company, made its way to the Red Cross officials, and he was forced to resign. Lawson was under suspicion, but he managed to stay in Italy and do public-relations work for the Red Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Hara|2000|loc=1-375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1919, Lawson left Italy for Paris, where he married his first wife, Katharine (Kate) Drain, who was a volunteer nurses aide, and later would be an actress. They would have one child, but divorce by 1923.

===Post War===
After the war he edited a newspaper in [[Rome]]. He then lived in Paris in 1920-1921, which is where he would complete ''[[Roger Bloomer]]''. This was Lawson's first show to reach Broadway, which opened on March 1, 1923. It was put on by the Equity Players and ran for fifty performances.

His next show, ''[[Processional (play)|Processional]]'',opened on Broadway on January 12, 1925 and was put on by the [[Theatre Guild]]. It ran for 96 performances. The production, however, failed financially, and the Theatre Guild told Lawson that they would not stage any more expressionistic plays.It was later revived in 1937 for the [[Federal Theatre Project]] to critical and popular acclaim.

His love of theatre was heightened when in 1926 the New York International Theatrical Exposition showcased experimental European cubist, futurist, and constructivist plays. After seeing this, Lawson, Dos Passos, and [[Mike Gold|Michael Gold]] (founder/editor of [[The New Masses]]) formed the Workers Drama League to produce revolutionary plays. Only one production and a few weeks later, the three men disbanded. They then joined Em Jo Basshe and [[Francis Edward Faragoh]] and formed the New Playwrights Theatre. This lasted until 1929, mostly due to the funding from millionaire [[Otto Hermann Kahn]].

March 3, 1926 was the premiere of ''Nirvana'' at the Greenwich Village Theatre, but only ran for six performances. The play calls for a new religion that can help people survive the swirling cyclone of jazz, new machinery, great buildings, science fiction, tabloids, and radio. The play was only put on for that long because of Lawson's reputation after ''Processional'' and the incredible set design by [[Mordecai Gorelik]].

In late 1926,  along with Dos Passos, Gold, were on the [[National Executive Committee]] who attempted to found the Proletarian Artists and Writers League, with backing from a similar Soviet organization. In August 1927, Dos Passos, Gold, and Lawson went to Boston to protest the [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] trial. In his diary afterword, Lawson would write that he could "neither ignore the flaws in American politics and economics nor bring himself to become more deeply involved in the struggle".

The first play produced by the New Playwrights Theatre, ''[[Loud Speaker]]'' opened on March 7, 1927 at the 52nd Street Theatre and ran for forty-two performances. The idea of the play stemmed from the ceremonial laying of the cornerstone at the new Theatre Guild playhouse in 1924, in which Governor [[Al Smith|Alfred E. Smith]] and Otto Kahn were both in attendance. Lawson wondered if Kahn would be a more interesting governor than Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Hara|2000|loc=1-375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hollywood===
While he was in Hollywood, [[New Playwrights Theatre]] decided to produce one of his plays, ''[[The International (play)|The International]]'', with the set design by [[John Dos Passos]]. It opened on January 12, 1928 and ran for twenty-seven performances.

In 1928, Lawson moved to Hollywood where he wrote scripts for films such as ''The Ship for Shanghai'', ''Bachelor Apartment'', and ''Goodbye Love''.  In the winter of 1930-1931, it was at this time during the [[Great Depression]] that Lawson wrote ''Success Story''. The Theatre Guild rejected the script, but [[Harold Clurman]], a reader for them, had recently just formed the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] and needed new scripts. Clurman and Lawson reworked the play during the summer of 1932, and ''Success Story'' opened on September 26, 1932 for 121 performances. Lawson would also pen the screenplay based on the play, ''Success at Any Price'' in 1934.

In 1933, [[Lester Cole]], [[Samuel Ornitz]], and Lawson helped to organize and become first presidents of the [[Writers Guild of America, West|Screen Writers Guild]]. After he was fired from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], he moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] to have the group established by [[National Labor Board]] for purposes of bargaining for screenwriters. While in D.C., ''The Pure in Heart'' and ''Gentlewoman'' were being produced in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Hara|2000|loc=1-375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawson wrote ''The Pure in Heart''  while he was working on Success Story. The [[Theatre Guild]] agreed to produce the play, but closed it when the out-of-town tryout in Baltimore failed. After the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] also rejected the play, it was produced by [[Richard Aldrich (producer)|Richard Aldrich]] and Alfred De Liagre. ''The Pure in Heart'' opened on March 20 and had a run of only seven performances.

''Gentlewoman'', in association with D. A. Doran Jr, was put up by the Group Theatre and opened on March 22, 1934. It ran for twelve performances.

During the 1930s, leftists accused Lawson of having a lack of ideological and political commitment. New Playwrights Theatre associate [[Mike Gold]] attacked him in ''[[The New Masses]]'' on April 10, 1934, calling him a "A Bourgeois Hamlet of Our Time" who wrote adolescent works that lacked moral fiber or clear ideas. Lawson responded a week later in ''The New Masses'' in the article "'Inner Conflict' and Proletarian Art" he cited his middle-class childhood as the reason why he could not fully understand the working people. He also recognized that his prosperity and Hollywood connections were suspect in the fight for workers' rights. Due to the criticism, he joined the [[Communist Party]] and began a program of educating himself about the [[Proletariat|proletarian]] cause. He would soon travel throughout the poverty-stricken South to study bloody labor conflicts in Alabama and Georgia.

While in the South, he would submit articles to the ''[[Daily Worker]]'', which got him arrested numerous times. These experiences would inspire his next play, ''Marching Song''. It was put on by the radical Theatre Union and it opened on February 17, 1937 and ran for sixty-one performances.

Lawson, who joined the [[American Communist Party]] in 1934, made several films that were political, including ''[[Blockade (1938 film)|Blockade]]'' (1938), which starred [[Henry Fonda]]. It was a film on the [[Spanish Civil War]] for which he received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Story]].  Lawson also wrote ''[[Counter-Attack]]'' (1945), a tribute to the Soviet-USA alliance during the [[Second World War]].  He also wrote more innocuous films, such as the critically acclaimed ''[[Algiers (film)|Algiers]]'' (1938) and the [[Humphrey Bogart]] vehicles ''[[Sahara (1943 American film)|Sahara]]'' and ''[[Action in the North Atlantic]]'' in 1943.

===The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)===
After [[World War II]], the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) began an investigation into the Hollywood Motion Picture Industry. Lawson appeared before the HUAC on October 29, 1947, but like [[Alvah Bessie]], [[Herbert Biberman]], [[Albert Maltz]], [[Adrian Scott]], [[Dalton Trumbo]], [[Lester Cole]], [[Edward Dmytryk]], [[Samuel Ornitz]] and [[Ring Lardner Jr]], he refused to answer almost all questions. Known as the [[Hollywood Ten]], they claimed that the [[First Amendmen]]t of the [[United States Constitution]] gave them the right to do this.  The HUAC and U.S. appeals courts, however, disagreed and all were found guilty of contempt of Congress and Lawson was sentenced to twelve months in Ashland Prison and fined $1,000.  In his 1951 HUAC testimony, [[Edward Dmytryk]] testified that Lawson, amongst others, had pressured him to put [[communist]] [[propaganda]] in his films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6441 “They Want to Muzzle Public Opinion”: John Howard Lawson’s Warning to the American Public] Testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) October 27, 1947. In: History Matters, The American Social History Project, CUNY and George Mason University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawson had organized and led the attack on Albert Maltz when Maltz published an article, "What Shall We Ask of Writers",  in ''The New Masses'', challenging the didacticism of the American Communist Party's censorship of writers.  Surprised by the ferocity of attack from his fellow writers, including Lawson, Howard Fast, Alvah Bessie, Ring Lardner, Jr., Samuel Sillen, and others, Maltz publicly recanted.

===Post blacklist===
Blacklisted by the Hollywood studios, Lawson moved to [[Mexico]] where he began writing Marxist interpretations of drama and film-making such as ''The Hidden Heritage'' (1950), ''Film in the Battle of Ideas'' (1953) and ''Film: The Creative Process'' (1964). He also wrote one of the first anti-apartheid movies, ''[[Cry, the Beloved Country (1951 film)|Cry, the Beloved Country]]'' (1951) under a pseudonym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0493251/bio |title=John Howard Lawson - Biography, IMDb|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After he was blacklisted, he taught at several universities including: [[Stanford University]], [[Loyola Marymount University]], and Los Angeles University of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Hara|2000|loc=1-375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Film in the Battle of Ideas'', Lawson wrote that "the rulers of the United States take the film very seriously as an instrument of propaganda" and that the influence of Hollywood movies is utilized to "poison the minds of U.S. working-class people" and that inaccurately describes the reality of U.S. working-class life. Lawson wrote that Hollywood "falsifies the life of American workers" and its "unwritten law decrees that only the middle and upper classes provide themes suitable for film presentation, and that workers appear on the screen only in subordinate or comic roles." According to Lawson, "workers and their families see films which urge them to despise the values by which they live, and to emulate the corrupt values of their enemies" and "the consistent presentation on the nation's screens of the views that working-class life is to be despised and that workers who seek to protect their class interests are stupid, malicious, or even treasonable" is what Hollywood engages in.

Lawson also argued that Hollywood promoted degrading images of women in the first half of the 20th century.  According to Lawson, "Hollywood treats 'glamour' and sex appeal as the sum-total of woman's personality" and "portraits of women in Hollywood films fall into three general categories: the woman as a criminal or the instigator of crime; the woman as man's enemy, fighting and losing - for she must always lose - in the battle of the sexes; the woman as a `primitive' child, fulfilling the male dream of a totally submissive vehicle of physical pleasure." Lawson also argued that in most U.S. movies "when a woman succeeds in the world of competition, Hollywood holds that her success is achieved by trickery, deceit, and the amoral use of sexual appeal."

His unpublished autobiography is at [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] in [[Carbondale, Illinois]].

==Religion==
He was born into a wealthy Jewish family, and this is said to have caused some dilemmas while he was younger. He once went over to a Christian schoolmate's house to play, and he let slip that his father's real name was Levy. He was thereafter not invited to the house again.

His father also insisted for the sake of appearances that they should join a Christian church. They joined the First Church at 96th Street and Central Park West, but John Howard still maintained strict observation of Jewish dietary laws.

While at [[Williams College]] during his sophomore year, he was denied election to the editorial board of ''The Williams College Monthly'' because some students raised questions about his Jewish background. He would later say that it was a good experience because it forced him "to begin his struggle to come to terms with his Jewish identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Hara|2000|loc=1-375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Distinguish|Gumelniţa-Karanovo culture}}
[[File:KaranovoVenus.jpg|thumb|left]]
The '''Karanovo culture''' is a [[neolithic Europe|neolithic culture]] (Karanovo I-III ca. 62nd to 55th centuries BC) named for the [[Bulgaria]]n village of {{ill|Karanovo, Sliven Province|lt=Karanovo|bg|Караново (област Сливен)}} (Караново, [[Sliven Province]] {{coord|42|30|41|N|25|54|54|E|}}). The site at Karanovo itself was a hilltop settlement of 18 buildings, housing some 100 inhabitants.[http://w3.cnice.mec.es/eos/MaterialesEducativos/mem2001/huellas/origenes/neolitico/030dondevivian.htm]. This site was inhabited more or less continuously from the early 7th to the early 2nd millennia BC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2652">[[Image:Kiekie yams.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The farmer's wife wears a kiekie knitted from plastic rope. The round shapes are known as ''vana'' (sea-urchins)]]
A '''kiekie''' is a [[Tonga]]n dress, an ornamental girdle around the waist, mainly worn by women on semiformal occasions, but nowadays also sometimes by men. At highly formal occasions both gender will settle for a [[ta'ovala|ta{{okina}}ovala]]. At casual occasions no girdle is needed for any gender, although women may continue wearing a kiekie even then, as it is considered an easy sitting, nice looking decoration, with which one can show off. (All ta{{okina}}ovala look more or less the same, and are usually quite stiff and hot to wear).

The characteristic of a kiekie is that it is between a mat and a grass skirt ''(manafau)'': it is a string skirt attached to a waistband. It is  supposed to be somewhat transparent, showing the [[skirt]] or [[tupenu]] worn under it. The strings can be short as a mini skirt, or down to the ankles, but down to somewhat above the knees is most common.

Related to the kiekie is the ''sisi'', where the strings are [[ti (plant)|sī]] leaves or plaited ''maile'' leaves, but where the waistband, full with sweet smelling flowers and fruits, is more important. Sisi are worn by both gender during dance performances.

Kiekie are part of the [[koloa]], the handicraft goods made by the women. Every woman can do it, although nowadays we see that some women specialise in it and sell their products on the market.

Kiekie can be made from many different materials, both natural and introduced:
*strips of [[pandanus]] leaves, often painted in bright colours. Either hanging loose, or plaited together. The ''salusalu'' is a long kiekie, especially for [[Ha'apai|Ha{{okina}}apai]].
*strips of [[hibiscus]] bast fiber, called ''fau''. Same as the pandanus leaves, but not as coarse and therefore suited for finer designs.
*''kaka'', de fibrous tissue which is wrapped around the growing fronds of [[Arecaceae|palm]] trees. It is usually varnished to make it stronger and then cut in all type of shapes.
*strings or ropes
*little disks (few centimeter diameter) made from coconut shell and strung together along their diameter.
*[[New Zealand flax]], a [[Māori people|Māori]] [[piupiu]] (see [[Pania]]).

'''Kings Crossing Site''' is an [[archaeological site]] that is a [[type site]] for the ''Kings Crossing Phase (950-1050 CE)'' of the Lower Yazoo Basin [[Coles Creek culture|Coles Creek]] chronology.

==Location==
[[Image:Kings crossing moundA HRoe 2005.jpg|left|150px|thumb|A photo of Mound A]]
The site is located four miles north of the center of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], between Chickasaw Bayou and the Illinois Central railroad tracks.

==Site importance==
[[Clarence Bloomfield Moore|Clarence B. Moore]], who visited the site in 1908, described [[Platform mound|Mound]] A as being {{convert|25|ft|m}} tall, although by the 1950s it had been significantly reduced in height. Mound B has been almost completely leveled, although a small rise can be discerned. Mound C is roughly {{convert|12|ft|m}} tall. Mounds A and C are both roughly {{convert|120|ft|m}} sq. Pottery sampling in the 1950s from Mound A gave the site a historical importance out of all proportion to its size. Test pits from a 1949 excavation of the [[Holly Bluff Site]] produced an important glimpse of a late "transitional" Coles Creek to [[Plaquemine culture|Plaquemine]] assemblage featuring thin tapered rims of polished plain ware and carefully executed varieties of Coles Creek incised and associated types. Although intriguing as [[Native American pottery|pottery]], it was not sufficiently integrated strategraphically to postulate a distinct phase. Site sampling from the Kings Crossing Site in 1954 supplied the integration and gave the phase a name. Since then, especially in the [[Tensas River|Tensas Basin]], it has become one of the firmest and most easily identifiable ceramic complexes in the Lower Mississippi area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Philip Phillips (archaeologist)| last =Phillips| first = Philip |  title = Archaeological Survey in the Lower Yazoo Basin, Mississippi, 1949-1955 | publisher = [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] | year = 1970 | pages = 435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the Kings Crossing Site was portrayed on the [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] Floodwall Mural project to represent the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] heritage of the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riverfrontmurals.com/indian.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Korg: 70,000 B.C.''''' is a 30-minute [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning]] [[Live action|live-action]] [[Television program|television series]] created by [[Fred Freiberger]], narrated by [[Burgess Meredith]] and produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] which was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 7, 1974 to August 30, 1975.

''Korg'' featured the adventures of a family of [[Neanderthal]]s during the [[Ice Age]]. It was intended to be educational, and was based on the best then-current research about Neanderthal life, except where its situations had to be watered down for a young audience which Hanna, Barbera, and [[American Broadcasting Company|the network]] feared might be terrified without such expurgation.

A board game of the same title was produced by the US toy company [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley]] as a direct tie-in.  [[Charlton Comics]] published a Korg comic book from May 1975 to November 1976.  The series was written and drawn by [[Pat Boyette]], and lasted for 9 issues.

The [[American Museum of Natural History]] and The [[Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History]]  served as consultants to the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TV Guide Guide to TV|year=2004|publisher=Barnes and Noble|isbn=0-7607-5634-1|pages=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete series (actually only 16 of the 19 episodes) was released by Warner Archive on December 11, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Korg-70000-BC-The-Complete-Series/17756|title=Korg: 70,000 B.C. - 'The Complete Series' of the Live-Action Saturday Morning Show|work=[[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]|last=Lambert|first=David|date=November 16, 2012|accessdate=December 3, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119142728/http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Korg-70000-BC-The-Complete-Series/17756|archivedate=November 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''KryoFlux''' is a hardware and software solution for preserving [[software]] on [[floppy disk]]s. It was developed by the Software Preservation Society.

KryoFlux consists of a small hardware device,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Software Preservation Society - Glossary KryoFlux|url=http://softpres.org/glossary:kryoflux}} 191206 softpres.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Software Preservation Society - News 2010-02-18|url=http://softpres.org/news:2010-02-18}} 100220 softpres.org&lt;/ref&gt; which is a software-programmable [[Floppy disk controller|FDC]] system that runs on small [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based devices that connects to a [[floppy disk drive]] and a host PC over USB, and software for accessing the device. KryoFlux reads "flux transitions" from floppy disks at a very fine resolution. It can also read disks originally written with different [[bit cell]] widths and drive speeds, with a normal fixed-speed drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Software Preservation Society - Glossary KryoFlux|url=http://softpres.org/glossary:kryoflux}} 191206 softpres.org&lt;/ref&gt; The software is available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS]] and [[Linux]]. The KryoFlux controller plugs into a standard USB port, and allows normal PC floppy disk drives to be plugged into it.

Because the device operates on data bits at the lowest possible level with very precise timing resolution, it allows modern PCs to read, decode and write floppy disks that use practically any data format or method of [[copy protection]] to aid in [[digital preservation]]. It has been tested successfully with many generations of floppy disk drive including 8", 5.25", 3.5" and 3" mechanisms, and dozens of disk formats including numerous schemes originally designed to prevent [[software piracy]], allowing the preservation (typically to an image file stored on hard disk or other modern media) of programs and data that will inevitably succumb to [[data degradation]] as the original physical media deteriorates and becomes unreadable over time. The image files produced may be rewritten to fresh disk media or, more commonly, used with [[List_of_emulators|software emulations]] of the original systems.

When reading old disks (especially those stored in non-climate controlled environments for long periods) there are a number of problems that can arise due including weakening of the magnetic field storing the data, deterioration of the binder holding the metal particles to the plastic disk surface, friction issues preventing the disk rotating freely in its outer protective sleeve, and issues caused by physical misalignment of the drive that originally wrote the disk or the one being used to read it. Users have detailed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gough's Tech Zone - A detailed description of recovering a number of old disks and problems encountered|url=http://goughlui.com/2013/04/21/project-kryoflux-part-1-the-board-and-associated-hardware/}}&lt;/ref&gt; various techniques to aid in the recovery of data stored on such marginal disks.

'''Lamanai''' (from ''Lama'anayin'', "submerged [[Crocodylus|crocodile]]" in [[Yucatec Maya]]) is a [[Mesoamerica]]n [[archaeological site]], and was once a major city of the [[Maya civilization]], located in the north of [[Belize]], in [[Orange Walk District]]. The site's name is [[pre-Columbian]], recorded by early [[Spain|Spanish]] missionaries, and documented over a millennium earlier in [[Maya script|Maya inscriptions]] as '''''Lam'an'ain'''''. Lamanai is renowned for its exceptionally long occupation spanning three millennia, beginning in the Early [[Preclassic Maya]] period and continuing through the Spanish and British Colonial periods, into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Elizabeth A.|title=Maya Christians and Their Churches in Sixteenth-Century, Belize|date=2011|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainseville|isbn=9780813040721|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/maya-christians-and-their-churches-in-sixteenth-century-belize/oclc/758668809&amp;referer=brief_results|accessdate=Jan 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most Classic-period sites in the [[Geography of Mesoamerica|southern Maya lowlands]], Lamanai was not abandoned at the end of the 10th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pendergast|first1=David M.|title=Stability through Change: Lamanai, Belize, from the ninth to the seventeenth century|journal=Late Lowland Maya Civilization: Classic to Postclassic|date=1986|volume=School of American Research, University of New Mexico Press|pages=223–249|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/late-lowland-maya-civilization-classic-to-postclassic/oclc/12420464&amp;referer=brief_results|accessdate=Jan 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lamanai was occupied as early as the 16th century BC.&lt;ref name="lapsite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csms.ca/Lamanai%20Field%20School.htm|title=LAMANAI ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site became a prominent centre in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Pre-Classic Period]], from the 4th century BC through the 1st century CE. In 625 CE, "Stele 9" was erected there in the Yucatec language of the [[Maya peoples|Maya]].&lt;ref name="mpc"&gt;Michael P. Closs [http://www.mesoweb.com/bearc/cmr/21_text.html The Hieroglyphic Text of Stela 9], Lamanai, Belize, Retrieved 6/26/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Lamanai continued to be occupied up to the 17th century AD. During the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] Spanish friars established two [[Roman Catholic]] churches here, but a Maya revolt drove the Spanish out.&lt;ref name="lapsite" /&gt; The site was subsequently incorporated by the British in British Honduras, passing with that colony's independence to Belize.

==Site description==
The vast majority of the site remained unexcavated until the mid-1970s. Archaeological work has concentrated on the investigation and restoration of the larger structures, most notably the [[Mask Temple, Lamanai|Mask Temple]], [[Lamanai Structure N10-9|Jaguar Temple]], and [[High Temple, Lamanai|High Temple]]. The summit of this latter structure affords a view across the surrounding jungle to a nearby lagoon, part of [[New River (Belize)|New River]].

A significant portion of the Temple of the Jaguar Masks remains under grassy earth or is covered in dense jungle growth. Fully excavated, it would be significantly taller than the High Temple. In the jaguar temple there is a legend that you can find an ancient spear called the heart of the jaguar, even though the temple got his name from the jaguar masks on each side.

The Maya ruins of Lamanai once belonged to a sizable Mayan city in the [[Orange Walk District]] of [[Belize]]. "Lamanai" comes from the Maya term for "submerged crocodile", a nod to the toothy reptiles who live along the banks of the New River.  Lamanai Belize jungle brims with exotic birds and hydrophilic iguanas. There is evidence on Mayan life that dates from about 1500 B.C. through Postclassic (A.D. 950-1544) and Spanish colonial times (A.D. 1544-1700) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joyce|first=Kelly|title=An Archeological Guide to Northern Central America|year=1996|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Oklahoma|pages=35–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chau Hiix===
Nearby ancient Mayan site of [[Chau Hiix]] presents evidence of a very long continuous occupation from Early Preclassic (ca 1200 BC) to Late Post Classic (ca 1600 AD). It lies between Lamanai and [[Altun Ha]], another site further to the east.

It is positioned on Western Lagoon near its outlet into Spanish Creek. Chau Hiix is 15&amp;nbsp;km east of Lamanai, and is accessible by waterways travel. Altun Ha lies another 25&amp;nbsp;km further to the east. The material culture of Chau Hiix shows close ties with both Lamanai and Altun Ha, as well as evidence of interaction with centers in [[Petén Basin]].

There are considerable ancient irrigation works at Chau Hiix, so it was probably an agricultural community supplying food for Lamanai.

Earliest cultural activity at Chau Hiix has been traced to the early Middle Preclassic Swasey phase (ca 1000-500 BC)&lt;ref&gt;Christopher R. Andres, [http://www.lamanai.org.uk/uploads/3/2/0/7/3207254/andres_architecturechauhiix2009_1.pdf ''Architecture and Sociopolitical Transformation at Chau Hiix, Belize.''

==Copper artifacts and their significance at Lamanai==
Among the many important aspects of Postclassic and early Spanish colonial period Maya life at Lamanai is shown by the presence of significant numbers of copper artifacts. Copper indicates broader trade relations in the southern Maya lowlands, and as a reflection of technological change, the history of metal artifact use at Lamanai is an invaluable element in the reconstruction of Postclassic and early historical dynamics. The archaeological contexts of copper objects recovered at Lamanai beginning, with the appearance of metal at the site by around A.D. 1150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simmons|first=Scott|title=The Context and Significance of Copper Artifacts in Postclassic and Early Historic Lamanai, Belize|date=March 2009|volume= 34|issue= 1|pages=57–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological contexts in which copper objects have been recovered at the ancient Maya site of Lamanai in northern Belize have great significance in that these objects served great purpose for the  residents of the community during Postclassic time that dates from A.D. 950-1544. Nearly all of the copper objects found at Lamanai are distinctly Mesoamerican in form and design and based on metallurgical analyses it appears that manufacturing technologies were distinctly Mesoamerican as well. The presence of production materials and mis-cast pieces along with the results of chemical compositional and micro structural analysis support the idea that the&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mock|first=Shirley|title=The Sowing and Dawning|year=1998|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=New Mexico|pages=54–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Mayans at Lamanai were engaged in the on-site production of copper objects by late pre- Columbian times.(cite scott article). Objects are classified and examined in the contexts, forms, styles, uses, and sources of copper objects dating from the Buk ceramic phase, which coincides with the Early Postclassic period (A.D. 950-1200).

There were copper objects recovered at Lamanai beginning, with the appearance of metal at the site by around A.D. 1150. The term "copper"  is used to describe  the metal found at the site but, all of the copper artifacts found at Lamanai were alloyed with other metals such as tin or arsenic and could technically be considered bronze (Hosler 1994: 210-213).&lt;ref name="Weaver 1993 271–272"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weaver|first=Muriel|title=The Aztecs, Maya, and their Predecessors|year=1993|publisher=Academic Press Inc.|location=California|pages=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number and variety of copper objects recovered at Lamanai indicate that, as a new commodity with remarkably unique aural and visual properties, metal artifacts played an important role for at least some members of Postclassic and later contact period society. Masson notes that "metal was probably the most highvalued luxury good in this region of the Postclassic Maya world" (2003: 279). The inclusion of copper bells, elaborate rings, and button like ornaments in Early and Middle Postclassic elite burials shows that at least some residents of the site displayed such items in certain social and ritual settings. Copper bells worn during performances acted as auditory reminders of the high social standing of those who displayed them, and the lustrous copper finger rings and elaborate clothing ornaments served as visual indicators of elevated status.&lt;ref name="Weaver 1993 271–272"/&gt;

==Trade==
Trade was an essential component of Mesoamerican life in the Postclassic period and the Maya were active participants in a vast macro regional trade network. The movement of commodities as well as information and ideas into interior areas of the peninsula was facilitated by canoe travel along the coast and the extensive river systems in Belize. The importation of finished copper objects into the Maya area during Postclassic times was made possible by a vibrant, well-established exchange network that included Lamanai and a number of smaller Postclassic sites in northern Belize

Lamanai's key location on the New River Lagoon provided the site's inhabitants with access to a variety of Mesoamerican trade goods throughout of the site's 3500-year occupation. Copper objects such as bells, rings, and tweezers not only had great economic value but were also highly charged symbolic objects whose sounds and colors made them particularly important for use in ritual performances and as ornaments reflecting social status. More copper artifacts have been recovered at Lamanai than at any other site in the ancient Maya world. To date, a total of 187 copper artifacts have been excavated, including bells, rings, tweezers, various clothing ornaments, pins, axes, chisels, needles, and fish hooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chase|first=Diane|title=Mesoamerican Elites|year=1992|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Oklahoma|isbn=0-8061-2371-0|pages=61–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burials==
Lamanai  copper objects all were found associated with elite burials except for one object found in a cache and one found in a midden. Copper objects were found in six of the 97 burials excavated in these two structures.

==Copper metallurgy==
Evidence for onsite copper metallurgy at Lamanai consists of ingots, pigs, blanks, sheet pieces, mis-cast objects, and casting debris. Pigs are the product of pouring remainder metal from a cast out to cool; in contrast to ingots, pigs are usually not formed into standardized or even semi-standardized shapes or sizes.
The discussion of the forms and styles of copper artifacts from Lamanai follows Pendergast's (1962) typology of metal artifacts in Mesoamerica. This classification is based on the division of objects into one of three major functional categories: utilitarian objects, objects of personal adornment, and ceremonial objects  Dating of these metal artifacts is based primarily on their association with stylistically diagnostic ceramic forms. (Pendergast 1962: 521).&lt;ref name="Whittington 1997 129–226"&gt;{{cite book|last=Whittington|first=Stephen|title=Bones of the Maya|year=1997|publisher=British Library Cataloguing|location=Smithsonian Institution|isbn=1-56098-684-0|pages=129–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jaguar Temple, Mask Temple and High Temple==
{{main|Jaguar Temple|Mask Temple|High Temple}}
At the site there is structure that dates back to AD 625. The Jaguar Temple, named for its boxy jaguar decoration; the Mask Temple, adorned by a 13-foot stone mask of an ancient Maya king; and the High Temple, offering visitors a panoramic view from its summit.&lt;ref name="Weaver 1993 271–272"/&gt;

The most interesting features at the structure  are two masks that decorate the west facade of the temple. The masks are on two levels on the south side of a central stairway, on the lower level the masks more than 15 feet high. It represents a rather humanized face and is bordered by decorative elements. The headdress of the mask represents a crocodile. These masks are construed of stone armature covered with thick stucco into which the details are carved. The masks date to the late fifth to the early sixth century. At Lamanai, ceremonialism was strongly developed, providing evidence of ruling authority with tight control over the populace.&lt;ref name="Whittington 1997 129–226"/&gt;

At the large temple there was a single ball court, where an offering had been placed under its giant central marker. A lidded bowl contained 100g of crystalline hematite, 19 g of cinnabar in a miniature vessel, and other objects such as jade, shell, and pearl, all atop of a pool of mercury. Previously mercury had been found at Copan, Quirigua, and at Kaminaljuyo and lake Amtitlan, but not in such large quantity. This large amount of mercury found at the site of Lamanai had been probably collected for ritual use. Ceramics were also found at the site and gradually adopted new styles. Unfortunately, by the end of the Classic period, the norm here for burial custom was to smash vessels prior to interment.&lt;ref name="Weaver 1993 271–272"/&gt;

==Archaeological investigations==
The first detailed description of the ruins was made in 1917 by [[Thomas Gann]]. Archaeological excavations at the site began in 1974 under [[David M. Pendergast]] of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], which continued through 1988. Further excavations and restoration work is being conducted {{As of|2004|lc=on}}. The ruins are being excavated by a team from the nearby villages of [[Indian Church, Belize|Indian Church]] and [[San Carlos, Belize|San Carlos]]. The current project is co-directed by Dr. Elizabeth Graham (Institute of Archaeology, [[University College London]]) and Dr. Scott Simmons ([[University of North Carolina at Wilmington]]).&lt;ref name="lapsite" /&gt; Since 2006 research at the site has been directed mostly towards artifact analysis. Major excavations will resume when funding for more artifact processing, analyses and storage is acquired.

==Modern site and tourism==
Lamanai is accessible to [[tourism|tourists]] by organized day boat trips from [[Orange Walk Town]] along the New River, or by dirt and gravel road through the Mennonite area of [[Shipyard, Belize|Shipyard]].  A small museum exhibits local artifacts and provides a historical overview. Tourist facilities and small shops are available.

'''Language''' is a system that consists of the development, acquisition, maintenance and use of complex systems of [[communication]], particularly the [[human]] ability to do so&lt;!--Do not remove the qualifier "human" without first reading the article or consulting the discussions about this issue.--&gt;; and '''a language''' is any specific example of such a system.

The scientific study of language is called [[linguistics]]. Questions concerning the [[philosophy of language]], such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated at least since [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] in [[ancient Greece]]. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] have argued that language originated from [[emotion]]s while others like [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].

Estimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and [[dialect]]s. [[Natural language]]s are [[speech|spoken]] or [[sign language|signed]], but any language can be [[Encoding (semiotics)|encoded]] into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]&amp;nbsp;– for example, in [[Whistled language|whistling]], [[sign language|signed]], or [[braille]]. This is because human language is [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]]-independent. Depending on [[philosophy of language|philosophical perspectives]] regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, "language" may refer to the [[cognitive]] ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of [[semiosis]] to relate [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] to particular [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. [[Oral language|Oral]], [[sign language|manual]] and tactile languages contain a [[phonology|phonological]] system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or [[morpheme]]s, and a [[syntax|syntactic]] system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.

Human language has the properties of [[Productivity (linguistics)|productivity]] and [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of [[animal communication]]. Language is thought to have originated when early [[hominin]]s started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a [[Theory of mind|theory of other minds]] and a shared [[intentionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Chomsky|Fitch|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the [[human brain]], but especially in [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]s. Humans [[language acquisition|acquire]] language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human [[culture]]. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[social stratification]], as well as [[social grooming]] and [[entertainment]].

Languages [[language change|evolve]] and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be [[historical linguistics|reconstructed]] by [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparing]] modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a [[language family]]. The [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]] is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hindi]]; the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan family]] includes [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]] and the other [[Chinese language]]s, and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]; the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic family]] includes [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Somali language|Somali]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the [[Bantu languages]] include [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Zulu language|Zulu]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout [[Africa]]; and the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] include [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the [[Pacific]]. The languages of the [[Dravidian language|Dravidian family]], spoken mostly in Southern India, include [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Kannada language|Kannada]].  Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become [[Language death|extinct]] by the year 2100.

== Definitions ==
{{main|Philosophy of language}}
The English word ''language'' derives ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|*dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s}}'' "tongue, speech, language" through [[Latin]] ''lingua'', "language; tongue", and [[Old French]] ''[[wikt:language#Old French|language]]''.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=language |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=3rd|year=1992|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is sometimes used to refer to [[code]]s, [[cipher]]s, and other kinds of [[constructed language|artificially constructed communication systems]] such as formally defined computer languages used for [[programming language|computer programming]]. Unlike conventional human languages, a [[formal language]] in this sense is a [[system]] of [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] for [[encoding]] and decoding [[information]]. This article specifically concerns the properties of [[Natural language|natural human language]] as it is studied in the discipline of [[linguistics]].

As an object of linguistic study, "language" has two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g. "[[French language|French]]". The Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who defined the modern discipline of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the French word ''langage'' for language as a concept, ''[[langue and parole|langue]]'' as a specific instance of a language system, and ''parole'' for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language.&lt;ref name="Lyons2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speaking of language as a general concept, definitions can be used which stress different aspects of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="LyonsIntro"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory.&lt;ref name="TraskLanguage"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pages=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.{{sfn|Bett|2010}}

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its debates about human origins, it became fashionable to speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world&amp;nbsp;– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led to the question of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the [[linguistic turn]] and philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.{{sfn|Devitt|Sterelny|1999}}

===Mental faculty, organ or instinct===
One definition sees language primarily as the [[mind|mental faculty]] that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the [[human brain]]. Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, [[creole languages]] and spontaneously developed sign languages such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]]. This view, which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely [[innatism|innate]], for example, in [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] theory of [[Universal Grammar]], or American philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]]'s extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a [[cognitive science]] framework and in [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Fitch|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pinker|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal symbolic system===
Another definition sees language as a [[formal system]] of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages can be described as closed [[structural linguistics|structural systems]] consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=93}} This [[structuralism|structuralist]] view of language was first introduced by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]],&lt;ref name="Saussure"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Saussure|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of Saussure's view of language have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements and then by presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is [[Noam Chomsky]], the originator of the [[generative linguistics|generative theory of grammar]], who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=130}} Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature of the human mind and to constitute the rudiments of what language is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Chomsky|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in [[formal logic]], in [[formal grammar|formal]] [[theoretical linguistics|theories of grammar]], and in applied [[computational linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=93, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|1998|pp=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and other [[formal logic]]ians.

===Tool for communication===
[[File:ASL family.jpg|right|thumb|A conversation in [[American Sign Language]]]]
Yet another definition sees language as a system of communication that enables humans to exchange verbal or symbolic utterances. This definition stresses the social functions of language and the fact that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their environment. [[Functional theories of grammar]] explain grammatical structures by their communicative functions, and understand the grammatical structures of language to be the result of an adaptive process by which grammar was "tailored" to serve the communicative needs of its users.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Van Valin|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of language is associated with the study of language in [[pragmatics|pragmatic]], [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]], and interactive frameworks, as well as in [[sociolinguistics]] and [[linguistic anthropology]]. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of [[linguistic typology]], or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of [[grammaticalization]] tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as [[J.L. Austin]], [[Paul Grice]], [[John Searle]], and [[Willard van Orman Quine|W.O. Quine]].{{sfn|Nerlich|2010|p=192}}

===Unique status of human language===
{{main|Animal language|Great ape language}}

A number of features, many of which were described by [[Charles Hockett]] and called [[Hockett's design features|design features]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |title=The Problem of Universals in Language |last=Hockett |first=Charles F. |date=1966 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110023354/http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |archive-date=10 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2013-05-11 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; set human language apart from other known systems of communication, such as those used by non-human [[Animal language|animals]].

Communication systems used by other animals such as [[Bee learning and communication|bees]] or [[great ape language|apes]] are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hockett|1960}}; {{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, human language is open-ended and [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]], meaning that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible because human language is based on a dual code, in which a finite number of elements which are meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to form an infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences).&lt;ref name="Trask5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one study has demonstrated that an Australian bird, the [[chestnut-crowned babbler]], is capable of using the same acoustic elements in different arrangements to create two functionally distinct vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Crane |first2=Jodie S.|last3=Savage |first3=James L.|last4=Russel |first4=Andrew F. |last5=Townsend |first5=Simon W. |date=29 June 2015 |title=Experimental Evidence for Phonemic Contrasts in a Nonhuman Vocal System |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=13|issue=6|pages=e1002171|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002171|pmid=26121619 |pmc=4488142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Southern pied babbler|pied babblers]] have demonstrated the ability to generate two functionally distinct vocalisations composed of the same sound type, which can only be distinguished by the number of repeated elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Ridley |first2=Amanda R.|last3=Townsend |first3=Simon W. |date=20 July 2017 |title=Element repetition rates encode functionally distinct information in pied babbler 'clucks' and 'purrs' |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=20 |issue=5|pages=953–60|doi=10.1007/s10071-017-1114-6|pmid=28730513|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/89798/7/WRAP-element-repetition-rates-encode-functionally-Townsend-2017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several species of animals have proved to be able to acquire forms of communication through social learning: for instance a [[bonobo]] named [[Kanzi]] learned to express itself using a set of symbolic [[lexigram]]s. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The gorilla [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] reportedly uses as many as 1000 words in [[American Sign Language]], and understands 2000 words of spoken English. There are some doubts about whether her use of signs is based on complex understanding or simple [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]]; {{harvcoltxt|Candland|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; none have been able to learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ [[grammatical categories|grammatical and semantic categories]], such as noun and verb, present and past, which may be used to express exceedingly complex meanings.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"/&gt; Human language is also unique in having the property of [[Recursion#Recursion in language|recursivity]]: for example, a noun phrase can contain another noun phrase (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[[the chimpanzee]'s lips]&lt;/nowiki&gt;") or a clause can contain another clause (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[I see [the dog is running]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;").&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt; Human language is also the only known natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as ''modality independent''. This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or medium, but through several. For example, spoken language uses the auditive modality, whereas [[sign language]]s and writing use the visual modality, and [[braille]] writing uses the tactile modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=165–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human language is also unique in being able to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called ''[[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]]'', and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of [[bee]]s that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.&lt;ref name="Trask5"/&gt;

The [[Christian mythology|Biblical myth]] of the [[Tower of Babel]] is one such account; other cultures have different stories of how language arose.&lt;ref name="Haugen"/&gt;
}}
Theories about the origin of language differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on the generative view of language pioneered by [[Noam Chomsky]] see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ulbaek|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky is one prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"/&gt; He suggests that for scholars interested in the nature of language, "talk about the evolution of the language capacity is beside the point."{{sfn|Chomsky|1972|p=86}} Chomsky proposes that perhaps "some random mutation took place [...] and it reorganized the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}} Though cautioning against taking this story literally, Chomsky insists that "it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes, including language."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}}

Continuity-based theories are held by a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], hold the precedents to be [[animal cognition]],&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt; whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist [[Michael Tomasello]], see it as having developed from [[animal communication]] in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation.&lt;ref name="Tomasello 2008"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from [[music]], a view already espoused by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], and [[Charles Darwin]]. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist [[Steven Mithen]].{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=466–507}} [[Stephen R. Anderson|Stephen Anderson]] states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered&amp;nbsp;... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because language emerged in the early [[prehistory]] of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and it is believed that no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a [[larynx]] capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=250–92}}

It was mostly undisputed that pre-human [[australopithecine]]s did not have communication systems significantly different from those found in [[great ape]]s in general. However, a 2017 study on [[Origin of language#Ardipithecus ramidus|Ardipithecus ramidus]] challenges this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001 |pmid=28363458 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus  and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability |journal=HOMO |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=101–21 |year=2017 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of the genus ''[[Homo]]'' some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (2.3 million years ago) while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (1.8 million years ago) or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' (0.6 million years ago), and the development of language proper with [[Anatomically modern humans|Anatomically Modern ''Homo sapiens'']] with the [[behavioral modernity|Upper Paleolithic revolution]] less than 100,000 years ago.{{sfn|Foley|1997|pp=70–74}}{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=292–93}}

{{main|Linguistics|History of linguistics}}
The study of language, [[linguistics]], has been developing into a science since the first grammatical descriptions of particular languages in [[India]] more than 2000 years ago, after the development of the [[Brahmi script]]. Modern linguistics is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdisciplines===
The academic study of language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, [[descriptive linguistics]] examines the grammar of single languages, [[theoretical linguistics]] develops theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, [[sociolinguistics]] studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, [[neurolinguistics]] studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, [[computational linguistics]] builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and [[historical linguistics]] relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the [[comparative method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
The formal study of language is often considered to have started in [[India]] with [[Pāṇini]], the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. However, [[Sumer]]ian scribes already studied the differences between [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures that adopted writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century AD, the French [[Port-Royal Grammar]]ians developed the idea that the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the [[comparative method]] by British [[philologist]] and expert on ancient India [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] sparked the rise of [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1914|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Early in the 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.&lt;ref name="Saussure"/&gt;

By introducing a distinction between [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] and [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagm]] and [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigm]], and the [[Langue and parole|Langue-parole distinction]], distinguishing language as an abstract system (''langue''), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (''parole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clarke|1990|pages=143–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary linguistics===
In the 1960s, [[Noam Chomsky]] formulated the [[Generative linguistics|generative theory of language]]. According to this theory, the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called [[Universal Grammar]]; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to the formal theories of the generative school, [[Functional theories of grammar|functional theories of language]] propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. [[Formal grammar|Formal theories of grammar]] seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Functional grammar analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyzes the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approaches not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate even as a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formal and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation"; {{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework of [[cognitive linguistics]] interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|Cruse|2004|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological and neural architecture of language and speech==
Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=11–14, 105–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the [[genetics|genetic]] bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is [[FOXP2]], which may cause a kind of [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia|congenital language disorder]] if affected by [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Fisher|Lai|Monaco|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The brain===
{{main|Neurolinguistics|Language processing in the brain}}
[[File:Brain Surface Gyri.SVG|thumb|Language Areas of the brain. The [[Angular Gyrus]] is represented in orange, [[Supramarginal Gyrus]] is represented in yellow, [[Broca's area]] is represented in blue, [[Wernicke's area]] is represented in green, and the [[Primary Auditory Cortex]] is represented in pink.]] The brain is the coordinating center of all linguistic activity; it controls both the production of linguistic cognition and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production. Nonetheless, our knowledge of the neurological bases for language is quite limited, though it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref name="Lesser205"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lesser|1989|pp=205–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early work in neurolinguistics involved the study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is [[Wernicke's area]], which is in the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop [[receptive aphasia]], a condition in which there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal [[syntax|sentence structure]]. The second area is [[Broca's area]], in the posterior [[inferior frontal gyrus]] of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop [[expressive aphasia]], meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=105–07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, [[word repetition]], and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|p=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With technological advances in the late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated non-invasive techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[electrophysiology]] to study language processing in individuals without impairments.&lt;ref name="Lesser205"/&gt;

Spoken language relies on human physical ability to produce [[sound]], which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the [[ear drum]]. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box ([[larynx]]), and the upper vocal tract&amp;nbsp;– the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of [[Segment (linguistics)|segmental and suprasegmental]] elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[phonation]] type, voice [[timbre]], and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], all of which may have effects across multiple segments.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consonant]]s and [[vowel]] segments combine to form [[syllable]]s, which in turn combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. [[Acoustics|Acoustically]], these different segments are characterized by different [[formant]] structures, that are visible in a [[spectrogram]] of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|pp=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowels are those sounds that have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; Vowels are called ''[[Close vowel|close]]'' when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel {{ipa|[i]}} (English "ee"), or ''[[open vowel|open]]'' when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel {{ipa|[a]}} (English "ah"). If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth, the quality changes, creating vowels such as {{ipa|[u]}} (English "oo"). The quality also changes depending on whether the lips are [[Roundedness|rounded]] as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such as that between {{ipa|[i]}} (unrounded front vowel such as English "ee") and {{ipa|[y]}} ([[rounded front vowel]] such as German "ü").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consonants are those sounds that have audible friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, [[alveolar ridge]], [[palate]], [[Soft palate|velum]], [[uvula]], or [[glottis]]. Each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by [[manner of articulation]], or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called ''[[occlusive]]'' or ''[[stop consonant|stop]]'', or different degrees of aperture creating ''[[fricative]]s'' and ''[[approximant consonant|approximants]]''. Consonants can also be either ''[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced or unvoiced]]'', depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English {{ipa|[s]}} in ''bus'' ([[sibilant|unvoiced sibilant]]) from {{ipa|[z]}} in ''buzz'' ([[Voiced alveolar sibilant#Voiced alveolar sibilant|voiced sibilant]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity, and these are called ''[[Nasal consonant|nasals]]'' or ''[[Nasalization|nasalized]]'' sounds. Other sounds are defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called ''[[Lateral consonant|laterals]]'', because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called ''[[rhotics]]'') that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt;

By using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds of distinct sounds: some appear very often in the world's languages, whereas others are much more common in certain language families, language areas, or even specific to a single language.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
When described as a system of [[symbolic communication]], language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[meaning (semiotics)|meanings]], and a [[code (semiotics)|code]] connecting signs with their meanings. The study of the process of [[semiosis]], how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called [[semiotics]]. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ancient Tamil Script.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscription at [[Thanjavur]]]]
Some of the properties that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"/&gt;

The rules by which signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called [[syntax]] or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases, and texts is called [[semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division of language into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=218–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantics===
{{main|Semantics|Semiotics|Meaning (linguistics)}}
Languages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.

Thus, languages must have a [[vocabulary]] of signs related to specific meaning. The English sign "dog" denotes, for example, a member of the species ''[[Canis familiaris]]''. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific meanings is called the [[lexicon]], and a single sign connected to a meaning is called a [[lexeme]]. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words. Often, semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the form of [[Grammatical category|grammatical categories]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages contain the semantic structure of [[predicate (grammar)|predication]]: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally, semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign [[truth value]]s to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. "&lt;nowiki&gt;[x [is y]]" or "[x [does y]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of [[pragmatics]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"/&gt;

===Sounds and symbols===

Depending on modality, language structure can be based on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in [[phonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Goldsmith|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called [[phonetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, only a limited number of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"/&gt;

Sounds as part of a linguistic system are called [[phonemes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called [[minimal pair]]. In English, for example, the words ''bat'' {{ipa|[bæt]}} and ''pat'' {{ipa|[pʰæt]}} form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/p/}} differentiates the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}} (if they both occur) could be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between [[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated and non-aspirated]] pronunciations of consonants, as many other languages like [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Hindi]] do: the unaspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''spin'' {{ipa|[spɪn]}} and the aspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''pin'' {{ipa|[pʰɪn]}} are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called [[allophones]]), whereas in [[Mandarin Chinese]], the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words {{ipa|[pʰá]}} 'crouch' and {{ipa|[pá]}} 'eight' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).&lt;ref name="Trask214"/&gt;

All [[oral language|spoken languages]] have phonemes of at least two different categories, [[vowels]] and [[consonants]], that can be combined to form [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[pitch accent|pitch]], [[Vowel length|duration]], and [[tonal language|tone]] to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called [[suprasegmental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]] and [[Pirahã language]] with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like [[Taa language#Phonology|Taa]] may have as many as 141 phonemes.&lt;ref name="Trask214"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sign language]]s, [[Phoneme#Phonemes in sign languages|the equivalent to phonemes]] (formerly called [[chereme]]s) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C. (1960). ''Sign Language Structure: An Outline of the Visual Communication Systems of the American Deaf,'' Studies in linguistics: Occasional papers (No. 8). Buffalo: Dept. of Anthropology and Linguistics, University of Buffalo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C.; Dorothy C. Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg (1965). ''A dictionary of American sign languages on linguistic principles.'' Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|pp=539–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Writing system]]s represent language using visual symbols, which may or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The [[Latin alphabet]] (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the [[Inuktitut]] syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In [[logographic]] scripts, each sign represents an entire word,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.

Because all languages have a very large number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the [[Arabic script]]), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Coulmas|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to represent the sounds of the world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar===
{{main|Grammar}}
Grammar is the study of how meaningful elements called ''[[morpheme]]s'' within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be ''free'' or ''bound''. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called ''[[word]]s'', and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called [[affix]]es. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called ''syntax''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grammatical categories====
{{main|Grammatical category}}
Grammar can be described as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Allerton|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically [[morphosyntactic alignment|distinguishing between their relations]] to a predicate, the encoding of [[Grammatical tense|temporal]] and [[Preposition and postposition|spatial]] relations on predicates, and a system of [[grammatical person]] governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Word classes====
Languages organize their [[parts of speech]] into classes according to their functions and positions relative to other parts. All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denotes actions and events. The first group, which includes English words such as "dog" and "song", are usually called [[noun]]s. The second, which includes "run" and "sing", are called [[verb]]s. Another common category is the [[adjective]]: words that describe properties or qualities of nouns, such as "red" or "big". Word classes can be "open" if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively "closed" if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English, the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since an infinite number of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. "saddened") or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix, as in "noun-like"). In other languages such as [[Korean language|Korean]], the situation is the opposite, and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives is fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically, verbs are used to construct [[predicate (grammar)|predicates]], while nouns are used as [[argument]]s of predicates. In a sentence such as "Sally runs", the predicate is "runs", because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument "Sally". Some verbs such as "curse" can take two arguments, e.g. "Sally cursed John". A predicate that can only take a single argument is called [[transitivity (grammar)|''intransitive'']], while a predicate that can take two arguments is called [[transitive verb|''transitive'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other word classes exist in different languages, such as [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] like "and" that serve to join two sentences, [[article (grammar)|articles]] that introduce a noun, [[interjections]] such as "wow!", or [[ideophones]] like "splash" that mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals that describe the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the general noun classifier for humans is ''nin'' (人), and it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Senft|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''san-nin no gakusei'' (三人の学生) lit. "3 human-classifier of student"&amp;nbsp;— three students
For trees, it would be:
:''san-bon no ki'' (三本の木) lit. "3 classifier-for-long-objects of tree"&amp;nbsp;— three trees

====Morphology====
In linguistics, the study of the internal structure of complex words and the processes by which words are formed is called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. In most languages, it is possible to construct complex words that are built of several [[morpheme]]s. For instance, the English word "unexpected" can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes "un-", "expect" and "-ed".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aronoff|Fudeman|2011|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or [[affix]]es can be classified according to their position in relation to the root: ''[[prefix]]es'' precede the root, [[suffix]]es follow the root, and [[infix]]es are inserted in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word "run", which in the past tense is "ran". This process is called ''[[ablaut]]''. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of [[inflection]], which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of [[Morphological derivation|derivation]], which creates a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb "sing" has the inflectional forms "singing" and "sung", which are both verbs, and the derivational form "singer", which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix "-er".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Bauer|2003}}; {{harvcoltxt|Haspelmath|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called [[Isolating language|isolating]], or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word ''bonus'', or "good", consists of the root ''bon-'', meaning "good", and the suffix -''us'', which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and [[nominative]] case. These languages are called ''[[fusional languages]]'', because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are [[agglutinative languages]] which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is [[Turkish language|Turkish]], where for example, the word ''evlerinizden'', or "from your houses", consists of the morphemes, ''ev-ler-iniz-den'' with the meanings ''house-plural-your-from''. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called [[polysynthetic languages]]. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in [[Persian language|Persian]] the single word ''nafahmidamesh'' means ''I didn't understand it'' consisting of morphemes ''na-fahm-id-am-esh'' with the meanings, "negation.understand.past.I.it". As another example with more complexity, in the [[Yupik language|Yupik]] word ''tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq'', which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer", the word consists of the morphemes ''tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq'' with the meanings, "reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative", and except for the morpheme ''tuntu'' ("reindeer") none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a sentence. This is sometimes called ''[[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]]''. For example, in many Indo-European languages, adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number, case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective ''bonus'', or "good", is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. In many polysynthetic languages, verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example, in the [[Basque language|Basque]] phrase ''ikusi nauzu'', or "you saw me", the past tense auxiliary verb ''n-au-zu'' (similar to English "do") agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the ''n''- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the – ''zu'' suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as "see you-did-me"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syntax====
{{main|Syntax}}
[[File:Constituent structure analysis English sentence.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|In addition to word classes, a sentence can be analyzed in terms of grammatical functions: "The cat" is the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the phrase, "on the mat" is a [[locative (case)|locative]] phrase, and "sat" is the core of the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]].]]

Another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules of a language determine why a sentence in English such as "I love you" is meaningful, but "*love you I" is not.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The prefixed asterisk * conventionally indicates that the sentence is ungrammatical, i.e. syntactically incorrect.&lt;/ref&gt; Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Baker|2001|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English, the two sentences "the slaves were cursing the master" and "the master was cursing the slaves" mean different things, because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely, in [[Latin language|Latin]], both ''Dominus servos vituperabat'' and ''Servos vituperabat dominus'' mean "the master was reprimanding the slaves", because ''servos'', or "slaves", is in the [[accusative case]], showing that they are the [[Object (grammar)|grammatical object]] of the sentence, and ''dominus'', or "master", is in the [[nominative case]], showing that he is the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of [[Wh-movement|inverse word order in questions]], which exists in many languages. This rule explains why when in English, the phrase "John is talking to Lucy" is turned into a question, it becomes "Who is John talking to?", and not "John is talking to who?". The latter example may be used as a way of placing [[focus (linguistics)|special emphasis]] on "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called [[phrase]]s, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.{{sfn|Baker|2001|pp=269–70}} To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=218–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason sentences can be seen as being composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations were carried out. For example, "the cat" is one phrase, and "on the mat" is another, because they would be treated as single units if a decision was made to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: "[And] on the mat, the cat sat".&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"/&gt; There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different manner.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;

===Typology and universals===
{{Main|Linguistic typology|Linguistic universal}}

Languages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types. Languages that belong to different families nonetheless often have features in common, and these shared features tend to correlate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1992}};{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, languages can be classified on the basis of their basic [[word order]], the relative order of the [[verb]], and its constituents in a normal indicative [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. In English, the basic order is [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]]: "The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)", whereas for example, the corresponding sentence in the [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian language]] [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] would be ''d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy'' (snake man bit), [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]].&lt;ref name="CroftErg"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word order type is relevant as a typological parameter, because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of [[prepositions]] or [[postpositions]]. Such correlations are called [[Linguistic universals|implicational universals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Greenberg|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most (but not all) languages that are of the [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]] type have postpositions rather than prepositions, and have adjectives before nouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009|p=45}}; {{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1994|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages structure sentences into Subject, Verb, and Object, but languages differ in the way they classify the relations between actors and actions. English uses the [[Nominative–absolutive language|nominative-accusative]] word typology: in English transitive clauses, the subjects of both intransitive sentences ("I run") and transitive sentences ("I love you") are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun ''I''. Some languages, called [[Ergativity|ergative]], Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead between Agents and Patients. In ergative languages, the single participant in an intransitive sentence, such as "I run", is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence, giving the equivalent of "me run". Only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun "I" be used.&lt;ref name="CroftErg"/&gt; In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the [[Tripartite language|tripartite type]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to universal laws governing the structure of natural languages, "language universals", or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;

==Social contexts of use and transmission==
[[File:Place des Abbesse (the plaque with the je t'aime=te iubesc in 311 laguages).jpg|thumb|The [[Wall of Love]] in [[Paris]], where the phrase "I love you" is featured in 250 languages of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.travelfranceonline.com/wall-of-love-mur-des-je-taime-montmartre/|title=Wall of Love&amp;nbsp;– Mur des Je t'aime&amp;nbsp;– Montmartre|publisher=Travel France Online|accessdate = 30 November 2014|date=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on [[speech community|communities of speakers]] in which children [[language acquisition|learn language]] from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to [[communicate]] and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.&lt;ref name="Myths"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Evans|Levinson|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to [[language contact]]. The process is similar to the process of [[evolution]], where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a [[phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, languages differ from biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements from other languages through the process of [[diffusion]], as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their [[first language]] or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming [[endangered language|endangered]] as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage and meaning===
{{main|Pragmatics}}

The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention. However, semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. Rather, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings, depending on the social context of use. An important example of this is the process called [[deixis]], which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the word, "I" (which designates the person speaking), "now" (which designates the moment of speaking), and "here" (which designates the position of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics. Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=54–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the act of "naming", which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of "pronouncing someone man and wife", which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called [[speech act]]s, although they can also be carried out through writing or hand signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=226–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, "Can you reach the salt?", that is, in fact, not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called [[conversational implicature]]s. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring [[communicative competence]] in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=100–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
{{main|Language acquisition|Second-language acquisition|Second language|Language education}}
All healthy, [[Human development (biology)|normally developing]] human beings learn to use language. Children acquire the language or languages used around them: whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood. The development is essentially the same for children acquiring [[sign language|sign]] or [[oral language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bonvillian |first1=John D. |author2=Michael D. Orlansky |author3=Leslie Lazin Novack |title=Developmental milestones: Sign language acquisition and motor development |journal=Child Development |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=December 1983 |pages=1435–45 |doi=10.2307/1129806|pmid=6661942 |jstor=1129806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This learning process is referred to as first-language acquisition, since unlike many other kinds of learning, it requires no direct teaching or specialized study. In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'', naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] called this process "an instinctive tendency to acquire an art".&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt;

First language acquisition proceeds in a fairly regular sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular stages among normally developing infants. From birth, newborns respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to be able to distinguish between different [[Phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]]. Around six months of age, a child will begin [[babbling]], producing the speech sounds or [[handshape]]s of the languages used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average [[vocabulary]] of an eighteen-month-old child is around 50 [[word]]s. A child's first [[utterance]]s are [[Holophrasis|holophrases]] (literally "whole-sentences"), utterances that use just one word to communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, he or she will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months will begin to produce [[telegraphic speech]], or short sentences that are less [[Grammar|grammatically]] complex than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the age of three to five years, a child's ability to speak or sign is refined to the point that it resembles adult language.&lt;ref name="OGrady-Cho"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=O'Grady |first1=William |last2=Cho |first2=Sook Whan |chapter=First language acquisition |title=Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction |edition=fourth |location=Boston |publisher=Bedford St. Martin's |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennison"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Kennison|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies published in 2013 have indicated that unborn [[fetus]]es are capable of language acquisition to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;"First Impressions: We start to pick up words, food preferences and hand-eye coordination long before being born", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 1 (July 2015), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beth Skwarecki, "Babies Learn to Recognize Words in the Womb", ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 26 August 2013 [http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2013/08/babies-learn-recognize-words-womb]&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquisition of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Macaro|editor-first1=Ernesto| year=2010 | title=Continuum companion to second language acquisition|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9922-5|pages=137–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
{{see also|Culture#Language_and_culture|l1=Culture|Speech community}}
[[File:Arnold Lakhovsky Conversation.png|thumb|right|[[Arnold Lakhovsky]], ''The Conversation'' (c. 1935)]]
Languages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speaks them. Languages differ not only in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but also through having different "cultures of speaking." Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as difference from others. Even among speakers of one language, several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]], [[Anthropological linguistics|ethnolinguists]], and [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologists]] have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between [[Speech community|speech communities]].&lt;ref name=Duranti2003&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Duranti|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists use the term "[[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]]" to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically or socioculturally defined [[dialect]]s as well as the [[register (sociolinguistics)|jargons]] or [[style shifting|styles]] of [[subculture]]s. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.&lt;ref name="Foley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status as a second language speaker. These kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Agha|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups, or between [[social class]]es, just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dixon|1972|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures, for example, have elaborate systems of "social [[deixis]]", or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=311–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor", or "Your Honor", but in other languages, such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. For instance, in languages of east Asia such as [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and [[Old Javanese|Javanese]], different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"/&gt;

===Writing, literacy and technology===
{{main|Writing|Literacy}}
[[File:Winnipeg Forks - Plains Cree Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An inscription of [[Swampy Cree language|Swampy Cree]] using [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]], an [[abugida]] developed by Christian missionaries for Indigenous Canadian languages]]
Throughout history a number of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented. These are called [[writing systems]].

The use of writing has made language even more useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and [[formal education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Olson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[4th millennium BC]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BC]]. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of [[cultural diffusion]]. A similar debate exists for the [[Chinese script]], which developed around 1200 BC. The [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] (including among others [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script]]s) are generally believed to have had independent origins.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"/&gt;

===Change===
{{main|Language change|Grammaticalization}}
[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The first page of the poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', written in [[Old English]] in the early medieval period (800–1100 AD). Although Old English is the direct ancestor of modern English, it is unintelligible to contemporary English speakers.]]
All languages change as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and discourse. Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider changes to be "decay" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural and inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire [[Phonological change|phonological system]]. [[Sound change]] can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or [[distinctive feature|phonetic feature]] by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be ''conditioned'' in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be ''regular'', which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be ''sporadic'', affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a [[chain shift]] in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the [[Germanic languages]] when the sound change known as [[Grimm's law]] affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant *{{PIE|bʰ}} became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous *{{PIE|b}} in turn became /p/, and the previous *{{PIE|p}} became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why [[Italic languages]] such as Latin have ''p'' in words like '''''p'''ater'' and '''''p'''isces'', whereas Germanic languages, like English, have '''''f'''ather'' and '''''f'''ish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clackson|2007|pp=27–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in English, which is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin ''mea domina'' to eventually become the [[French language|French]] ''madame'' and American English ''ma'am''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as [[idiom]]s or particular constructions become [[grammaticalized]]. This frequently happens when words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate for the lost element. For example, in some varieties of [[Caribbean Spanish]] the final /s/ has eroded away. Since [[Standard Spanish]] uses final /s/ in the morpheme marking the [[grammatical person|second person]] subject "you" in verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun ''tú''. This means that the sentence "what's your name" is ''¿como te llamas?'' {{ipa|[ˈkomo te ˈjamas]}} in Standard Spanish, but {{ipa|[ˈkomo ˈtu te ˈjama]}} in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Zentella|2002|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example, the way the English "going to" construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full-fledged future tense (e.g. ''I'm gonna'').

Language change may be motivated by "language internal" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce, or through patterns of change that cause some rare types of constructions to [[Drift (linguistics)|drift]] towards more common types.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership in certain groups, such as social classes, or with [[Language ideology|ideologies]], and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas. In this way, issues of identity and politics can have profound effects on language structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact===
{{main|language contact}}
One important source of language change is contact and resulting [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]] of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers of two or more languages or [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] interact on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multilingualism]] is likely to have been the norm throughout [[human history]] and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the [[Nation state|ethno-national state]], monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Romaine|2001|p=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speakers of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge to become more similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this may lead to the formation of [[Sprachbund|language areas]] in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the [[Balkan language area]], the [[Mesoamerican language area]], and the [[Ethiopian language area]]. Also, larger areas such as [[South Asia]], Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific [[areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aikhenvald|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena, including [[language convergence]], [[loanword|borrowing]], and [[relexification]] (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new [[mixed language]]s that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called [[pidgins]] occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a [[creole language]]. An example of such mixed languages is [[Tok Pisin]], the official language of [[Papua New-Guinea]], which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and [[Austronesian languages]]; others are [[Haitian Creole|Kreyòl ayisyen]], the French-based creole language spoken in [[Haiti]], and [[Michif language|Michif]], a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language [[Cree language|Cree]] and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988}}; {{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Matras|Bakker|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[SIL Ethnologue]]'' defines a "living language" as "one that has at least one speaker for whom it is their first language". The exact number of known living languages varies from 6,000 to 7,000, depending on the precision of one's definition of "language", and in particular, on how one defines the distinction between languages and [[dialects]]. As of 2016, ''Ethnologue'' cataloged 7,097 living human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics|title = Ethnologue statistics|website = Summary by world area {{!}} Ethnologue|publisher = SIL|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ethnologue'' establishes linguistic groups based on studies of [[mutual intelligibility]], and therefore often includes more categories than more conservative classifications. For example, the [[Danish language]] that most scholars consider a single language with several dialects is classified as two distinct languages (Danish and [[Jutlandic dialect|Jutish]]) by the ''Ethnologue''.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt;

According to the ''Ethnologue'', 389 languages (nearly 6%) have more than a million speakers. These languages together account for 94% of the world's population, whereas 94% of the world's languages account for the remaining 6% of the global population. To the right is a table of the world's 10 most spoken languages with population estimates from the ''Ethnologue'' (2009 figures).&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages and dialects===
{{main|Dialect#Dialect or language}}
[[File:Novi Sad mayor office.jpg|thumb|[[Multilingualism|Multi-lingual]] sign outside the [[mayor]]'s office in [[Novi Sad]], written in the four official languages of the city: [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Pannonian Rusyn]]]]
There is no [[Language or dialect|clear distinction]] between a language and a [[dialect]], notwithstanding a famous [[aphorism]] attributed to linguist [[Max Weinreich]] that "[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]".&lt;ref name="5 minute linguist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rickerson |first=E.M. |title=What's the difference between dialect and language? |url=http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |work=The Five Minute Linguist |publisher=College of Charleston |accessdate=17 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219070627/http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |archivedate=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, national boundaries frequently override linguistic difference in determining whether two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects. [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] are, for example, often classified as "dialects" of Chinese, even though they are more different from each other than [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is from [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. Before the [[Yugoslav civil war]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] was considered a single language with two dialects, but now [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] are considered different languages and employ different writing systems. In other words, the distinction may hinge on political considerations as much as on cultural differences, distinctive [[writing system]]s, or degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language families of the world===
{{Main|Language family|Dialectology|Historical linguistics|List of language families}}
[[File:Primary Human Language Families Map.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Principal language families of the world (and in some cases geographic groups of families). For greater detail, see ''[[:Template:Distribution of languages in the world|Distribution of languages in the world]]''.]]
The world's languages can be grouped into [[Language family|language families]] consisting of languages that can be shown to have common ancestry. Linguists recognize many hundreds of language families, although some of them can possibly be grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of [[language isolate]]s: languages that cannot be shown to be related to any other languages in the world. Among them are [[Basque language|Basque]], spoken in Europe, [[Zuni language|Zuni]] of [[New Mexico]], [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] of Mexico, [[Ainu language|Ainu]] of Japan, [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]] of [[Pakistan]], and many others.&lt;ref name="Katzner"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Katzner|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language family of the world that has the most speakers is the [[Indo-European languages]], spoken by 46% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}, "[http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/family Summary by language family]"&lt;/ref&gt; This family includes major world languages like [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]]). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the [[Eurasia]]n [[Migration Period]] (c. 400–800 AD),{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and subsequently through the [[History of colonialism|European colonial expansion]], which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position in the [[Americas]] and much of [[Africa]]. The [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] are spoken by 20%&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; of the world's population and include many of the languages of East Asia, including Hakka, [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Cantonese]], and hundreds of smaller languages.&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009}}; {{harvcoltxt|Brown|Ogilvie|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Africa]] is home to a large number of language families, the largest of which is the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo language family]], which includes such languages as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Shona language|Shona]], and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]. Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; A similar number of people speak the [[Afroasiatic languages]], which include the populous [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language]], and the languages of the [[Sahara]] region, such as the [[Berber languages]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]].&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The [[Austronesian languages]] are spoken by 5.5% of the world's population and stretch from [[Madagascar]] to [[maritime Southeast Asia]] all the way to [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; It includes such languages as [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Maori language|Māori]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]], and many of the indigenous languages of [[Indonesia]] and [[Formosan languages|Taiwan]]. The Austronesian languages are considered to have originated in Taiwan around 3000 BC and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping, based on an advanced nautical technology. Other populous language families are the [[Dravidian languages]] of [[South Asia]] (among them [[Kannada language|Kannada]] [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]]), the [[Turkic languages]] of Central Asia (such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] (among them [[Khmer language|Khmer]]), and [[Tai–Kadai languages]] of [[Southeast Asia]] (including [[Thai language|Thai]]).&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The areas of the world in which there is the greatest linguistic diversity, such as the Americas, [[Papua New Guinea]], [[West Africa]], and South-Asia, contain hundreds of small language families. These areas together account for the majority of the world's languages, though not the majority of speakers. In the Americas, some of the largest language families include the [[Quechumaran languages|Quechumaran]], [[Arawak languages|Arawak]], and [[Tupi-Guarani languages|Tupi-Guarani]] families of South America, the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]], [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]], and [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] of [[Mesoamerica]], and the [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]], [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]], and [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language families of [[North America]]. In Australia, most indigenous languages belong to the [[Pama-Nyungan languages|Pama-Nyungan family]], whereas New Guinea is home to a large number of small families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.&lt;ref name="Katzner"/&gt;

[[endangered language|Language endangerment]] occurs when a language is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or [[language shift|shift]] to speaking another language. [[Language loss]] occurs when the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a ''[[dead language]]''. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an ''[[extinct language]]''. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of [[globalization]] and [[neo-colonialism]], where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The more commonly spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The total number of languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus is that there are between 6,000&lt;ref name="Moseley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Moseley|2010}}: "[http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php Statistics]"&lt;/ref&gt; and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of languages by number of native speakers|top 20 languages]], those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) operates with five levels of language endangerment: "safe", "vulnerable" (not spoken by children outside the home), "definitely endangered" (not spoken by children), "severely endangered" (only spoken by the oldest generations), and "critically endangered" (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often [[Speaker types|semi-speakers]]). Notwithstanding claims that the world would be better off if most adopted a single common ''[[lingua franca]]'', such as English or [[Esperanto]], there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the [[tower of Babel]] in the [[Old Testament]], that linguistic diversity causes political conflict,&lt;ref name="Haugen"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Haugen|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is contradicted by the fact that many of the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslav]] and [[American Civil War]], or the genocide of [[Rwanda]], whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many projects aim to prevent or slow this loss by [[language revitalization|revitalizing]] endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted [[Language policy|specific legislation]] to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous [[speech community|speech communities]]. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process that should not be counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy''' began in July 2007 with a series of [[drawing]]s by Swedish artist [[Lars Vilks]] that depicted the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]] as a [[roundabout dog]] (a form of [[street installation]] in Sweden). Several art galleries in Sweden declined to show the drawings, citing security concerns and fear of violence. The controversy gained international attention after the [[Örebro]]-based regional newspaper ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'' published one of the drawings on 18 August as part of an [[editorial]] on [[self-censorship]] and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=Rätten att förlöjliga en religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-18 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070906190721/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-06}}&lt;br/&gt;English translation: {{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=The right to ridicule a religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830163657/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While several other leading Swedish newspapers had published the drawings already, this particular publication led to protests from Muslims in Sweden as well as official condemnations from several foreign governments including [[Iran]],&lt;ref name=iran&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran protests over Swedish Muhammad cartoon |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-08-27 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829141345/http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |archivedate=2007-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref name=pakistan&gt;{{cite press release|title=PAKISTAN CONDEMNS THE PUBLICATION OF OFFENSIVE SKETCH IN SWEDEN |publisher=[[Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904154021/http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |archivedate=2007-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Afghanistan]],&lt;ref name=afghanistan&gt;{{cite news |first=Sayed |last=Salahuddin |title=Indignant Afghanistan slams Prophet Mohammad sketch |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/SouthAsiaNews/idINIndia-29281220070901 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egypt]],&lt;ref name=egypt&gt;{{cite news |first=Gwladys |last=Fouché |title=Egypt wades into Swedish cartoons row |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,,2161595,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jordan]],&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;{{cite news |title=Jordan condemns new Swedish Mohammed cartoon |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070903/wl_mideast_afp/jordanswedenislam_070903124623 |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the inter-governmental [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC).&lt;ref name=oic&gt;{{cite press release|title=The Secretary General strongly condemned the publishing of blasphemous caricatures of Prophet Muhammad by Swedish artist |publisher=[[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012054243/http://oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2007-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy occurred about a year and a half after the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] in Denmark in early 2006.

== Background ==

[[Image:Lars Vilks 20050722.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lars Vilks]]]]
On 11 June 2007, Vilks was invited to participate in an art exhibition on the theme "The Dog in Art" ({{lang-sv|Hunden i konsten}}) that was to be held in the small town of [[Tällerud]] in [[Värmland]]. Vilks submitted three [[pen]] and [[ink]] [[drawing]]s on [[ISO 216|A4 paper]] depicting [[Muhammad]] as a [[roundabout dog]]. At this time, Vilks was already participating with drawings of Muhammad in another exhibition in [[Vestfossen]], Norway, on the theme "Oh, My God". Vilks, who is a known proponent of [[institutional art]], has stated that his original intention with the drawings was to "examine the [[political correctness]] within the boundaries of the art community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Argument 6 september 2007 : Debatt om Yttrandefrihet |episodelink= |series=Argument |serieslink=Argument (television program) |credits= |network=[[Sveriges Television]] |station=[[SVT1]] |airdate=2007-09-06 |season=2 |number=1 |minutes= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vilks, the art and culture communities in Sweden repeatedly criticize the United States and [[Israel]], whereas Muslim values are rarely even questioned.&lt;ref name=site&gt;{{cite news|title=Islamists push for boycott of Swedish firms |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8542/20070919/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-09-19 |accessdate=2007-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028162633/http://www.thelocal.se/8542/20070919/ |archivedate=2007-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July, the day before the opening of the exhibition in Tällerud, the organizers decided to withdraw Vilks's drawings from the exhibition due to security concerns and fear of violence from [[Islamic extremism|Islamic extremists]] (''see [[Islam and blasphemy]] and [[Islam and animals]]''). Märta Wennerström, the exhibition's organizer, said that at first she "didn't realize the gravity of the situation" and that she made the decision to remove the drawings after consulting [[Government agencies in Sweden|Swedish government agencies]] and private persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muhammed som rondellhund stoppas |url=http://www.nwt.se/ArticlePages/200707/20/20070720205557_NWT845/20070720205557_NWT845.dbp.asp |publisher=[[Nya Wermlands-Tidningen]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-07-20 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823022045/http://www.nwt.se/ArticlePages/200707/20/20070720205557_NWT845/20070720205557_NWT845.dbp.asp |archivedate=2007-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bosse |last=Brink |title=Teckningar på Muhammed togs bort |url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_16316985.asp |publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-07-21 |accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the first refusal to publish the drawings, Vilks submitted his drawings to the [[Gerlesborg School of Fine Art]] in [[Bohuslän]] (where he is a frequent lecturer) for a special teachers' exhibition that was going to be opened on 18 August. On 13 August, however, the school announced that they also had decided to reject the drawings due to security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Johan |last=Sjöstrand |title=Stopp igen för Vilks Muhammed-bilder |url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_16670977.asp |publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-07-13 |accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second rejection started an intense debate in the Swedish media about [[self-censorship]] and [[freedom of expression]].

On 18 August, the [[Örebro]]-based regional newspaper ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'' published one of Vilks's drawings in an [[editorial]] on freedom of expression. The editorial defended "Muslims' right to freedom of religion" but also said it must be permitted to "ridicule Islam's most foremost symbols — just like all other religions' symbols."&lt;ref name=na/&gt; On the same day, the drawings were also published in several other Swedish newspapers including ''[[Aftonbladet]]'', ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'', ''[[Expressen]]'' and ''[[Upsala Nya Tidning]]''.

== Reactions ==

=== International reactions ===
On 27 August, the Swedish ''[[chargé d'affaires]]'' in [[Tehran]], Gunilla von Bahr, was summoned to the Iranian foreign ministry where she received a protest from the [[Government of Iran|Iranian government]] against the publication in ''Nerikes Allehanda''.&lt;ref name=iran/&gt; On 28 August the [[President of Iran]], [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], commented on the drawings during a press conference. He was quoted by the [[Islamic Republic News Agency]] as saying: "Religions call for friendship, equality, justice, peace and respect for divine prophets. The Zionists only pretend to believe in religion. They are telling lies. They are perpetrating oppression against the Europeans and putting at risk the prestige of Europe." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=President castigates Swedish daily for publishing blasphemy |url=http://www2.irna.com/en/news/view/line-17/0708280953195316.htm |publisher=[[Islamic Republic News Agency]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091659/http://www2.irna.com/en/news/view/line-17/0708280953195316.htm |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ahmadinejad claims 'Zionists' behind Swedish cartoon |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8319/20070828/ |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830131140/http://www.thelocal.se/8319/20070828/ |archivedate=2007-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 August, the Swedish ''chargé d'affaires'' in [[Islamabad]], Lennart Holst, was summoned to the [[Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] to receive a similar protest from the [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistani government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James |last=Savage |title=Muhammad cartoon: Sweden 'sorry for hurt feelings' |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8341/20070830/ |publisher=[[The Local]] |date=2007-08-30 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902154003/http://www.thelocal.se/8341/20070830/ |archivedate=2007-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs later issued a statement where it condemned the publication "in the strongest terms".&lt;ref name=pakistan/&gt;

On the same day the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC), an inter-governmental organization which represents 57 Muslim countries, issued a statement where it strongly condemned the publishing of blasphemous caricatures of Muhammad by Swedish artist Lars Vilks in the ''Nerikes Allehanda'' newspaper. The secretary-general of OIC, [[Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu]], further called on the Swedish government to take "immediate punitive actions against the artist and the publishers of the cartoon and asked for their unqualified apology".&lt;ref name=oic/&gt;

On 31 August, supporters from Islamic parties in Pakistan burned the [[Flag of Sweden|Swedish flag]] in the city of [[Lahore]]. In [[Karachi]], others torched an effigy of the [[Swedish Prime Minister]] to protest the cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Muslims Protest Swedish Newspaper's Cartoon of Prophet Muhammad |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,295431,00.html |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September, the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] newspaper ''[[Kabul Times]]'' published a statement by religious scholars, imams and the Afghan [[Ministry of Islamic Guidance]]. The statement said that "The sold-out enemies of Islam draw the cartoon of the respected Prophet of Islam once more. This has disturbed the Islamic world and aroused the indignation of all Muslims". The statement demanded those responsible be handed over to a court for prosecution and punishment.&lt;ref name=afghanistan/&gt;

On 3 September, the [[Ministry of Awqaf (Egypt)|Egyptian Ministry of Religious Endowments]] condemned the publication, saying that "such an irresponsible act is not conducive to friendly ties between the Islamic world and the west".&lt;ref name=egypt/&gt; On the same day, also the [[Government of Jordan|Jordanian government]] condemned the publication. A spokesperson for the government said that "The publication of this cartoon, which seeks to attack the character of the Prophet Mohammed, is unacceptable, rejected and condemned".&lt;ref name=jordan/&gt;

=== Domestic reactions ===
On 25 August, a group of about 60 Muslims held a demonstration outside ''Nerikes Allehanda'''s office in Örebro to protest against the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Erik |last=Hedtjärn |title=Demonstration mot Muhammedhundar |url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1058&amp;a=684516 |publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826215156/http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1058&amp;a=684516 |archivedate=2007-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August, [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Swedish Prime Minister]] [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]] commented on the issue and said: "I think it's important to say two things. First, we are eager to ensure that Sweden remains a country in which Muslims and Christians, people who believe in God and people who don't believe in God, can live side by side in a spirit of mutual respect [...] We are also eager to stand up for freedom of expression, which is enshrined in the [[Constitution of Sweden|constitution]] and comes naturally to us, and which ensures that we do not make political decisions about what gets published in the newspapers. I want to make sure we keep things that way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reinfeldt speaks out about Muhammad controversy |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8350/20070831/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902154105/http://www.thelocal.se/8350/20070831/ |archivedate=2007-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, around 300 demonstrators – led by the Islamic Cultural Centre in Örebro – assembled outside the offices of ''Nerikes Allehanda'' to protest against the newspaper's publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Demonstrators in Muhammad picture protest |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8351/20070831/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902153815/http://www.thelocal.se/8351/20070831/ |archivedate=2007-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt met with ambassadors from 22 Muslim countries to discuss the issue. Reinfeldt said that he had "explained how Swedish society works and that we don't have elected representatives making editorial decisions", adding that "this is an open country, a tolerant country".&lt;ref name=meeting1&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim ambassadors 'made no demands' |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8424/20070907/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]]/[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-09-07 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910191024/http://www.thelocal.se/8424/20070907/ |archivedate=2007-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the meeting, Egyptian ambassador [[Mohamed Sotouhi]] said, according to the news agency [[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå|TT]], that he and a group of fellow ambassadors had agreed on a list of measures that Sweden needed to take and to present it to the Prime Minister. "We want to see action, not just nice words. We have to push for a change in the law", he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim ambassadors: 'Sweden needs to change its laws' |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8412/20070906/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]]/[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-09-06 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908151322/http://www.thelocal.se/8412/20070906/ |archivedate=2007-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the meeting however, Reinfeldt denied that any such list had been presented to him.&lt;ref name=meeting1/&gt; According to the [[Syrian Arab News Agency]], a statement had been delivered from the Swedish embassy in [[Damascus]] to Syria's [[Grand Mufti]] [[Ahmad Bader Hassoun]] in which Reinfeldt "expressed his regret of the incident which has offended and upset Muslims, calling against instigating or offending other religions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sweden Apologizes for Newspapers Offending Muslims |url=http://www.sana.org/eng/22/2007/09/05/137784.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308164039/http://sana.org/eng/22/2007/09/05/137784.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-03-08 |publisher=[[Syrian Arab News Agency]] |date=2007-09-05 |accessdate=2007-09-12}} &lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish government has not commented on this statement.

[[Image:Muh-hund-originallit.JPG|thumb|right|200px|One of Vilks's original three drawings, depicting [[Muhammad]] as a [[roundabout dog]].]]
Also on 7 September, a group of about 550 Muslims gathered outside the offices of the newspaper ''[[Upsala Nya Tidning]]'' in [[Uppsala]], to protest against the newspaper's publication of the cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muhammad cartoons spark new protest |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8428/20070907/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-09-07 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910031849/http://www.thelocal.se/8428/20070907/ |archivedate=2007-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats and attacks ==
Following the publication in ''Nerikes Allehanda'', the [[Swedish Police Authority|Swedish police]] raised the security level around the newspaper's headquarters and some of its employees have been forced to use bodyguards after receiving death threats. Vilks himself has also received several death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Erik |last=Scherlund |title=Lars Vilks hotad till livet |url=http://tv4nyheterna.se/1.163969/nyheter/2007/08/31/lars_vilks_hotad_till_livet |publisher=[[TV4Nyheterna]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902105232/http://tv4nyheterna.se/1.163969/nyheter/2007/08/31/lars_vilks_hotad_till_livet |archivedate=2007-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One Muslim woman in western Sweden has been arrested on charges of issuing a death threat ({{lang-sv|olaga hot}}) against Vilks in an e-mail. The woman confirmed in police interrogation that she had written the mail and said that she did not have any regrets about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kvinna delgiven för mordhot av Vilks |url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_17015499.asp?blogAbuseID=36649 |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-09-05 |accessdate=2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September, one actual roundabout dog created by Vilks and local children was set alight as an apparent threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/8420/20070907/ The Local – Sculpture by controverial &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; artist set on fire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115075921/http://www.thelocal.se/8420/20070907/ |date=November 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September, it was reported that the group [[Islamic State of Iraq]] had placed a bounty of at least $100,000 on the head of Lars Vilks and 50,000 dollars on [[Ulf Johansson (editor)|Ulf Johansson]], editor-in-chief of ''Nerikes Allehanda''. The statement was found in an audio file on an Islamist website and was read by a person who identified himself as [[Abu Omar al-Baghdadi]], the purported head of the Islamic State of Iraq. "We announce a reward of $100,000 to anyone who kills this infidel criminal. This reward will be raised to $150,000 if he is slaughtered like a lamb," the statement said. The statement also threatened attacks on Swedish companies unless unspecified "crusaders" issued an apology. Vilks responded to the statement by saying: "I suppose this makes my art project a bit more serious. It's also good to know how much one is worth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Al-Qaida: Bounty on Swedish cartoonist |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070915/ap_on_re_mi_ea/al_qaida_cartoonist_1 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2007-09-15 |accessdate=2007-09-15}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Al-Qaeda puts bounties on heads of Swedes |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8498/20070915/ |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-09-15 |accessdate=2007-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918190204/http://www.thelocal.se/8498/20070915/ |archivedate=2007-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bounty set over Prophet cartoon |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6996553.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2007-09-15 |accessdate=2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States-based [[SITE Institute]] has reported that websites run by militant Islamists have listed the names of over 100 Swedish companies with addresses, maps and logos. The websites called for their readers to boycott these firms and "take revenge" on Sweden for the publication of the drawings.&lt;ref name=site/&gt;

The [[European Council for Fatwa and Research]] (ECFR) and the [[Federation of Islamic Organizations in Europe]] (FIOE) both condemned the death threats against Vilks and Johansson. ECFR also said it planned to issue a "counter [[fatwa]]" against the threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=European Muslims condemn death sentence |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8517/20070917/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-09-17 |accessdate=2007-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027165042/http://www.thelocal.se/8517/20070917/ |archivedate=2007-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Association of Newspapers]] (WAN), which represents over 18,000 newspapers around the world, issued a statement where it condemned the death threats and expressed support for ''Nerikes Allehanda'' in its right to publish the drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=WAN Backs Swedish Publishers in Freedom of Expression Dispute |publisher=[[World Association of Newspapers]] |date=2007-09-17 |url=http://www.wan-press.org/article15067.html |accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leif Stenberg''' ([[Ph.D]]) is the Director of the [https://www.aku.edu/ismc/Pages/home.aspx Institute for the Study of Muslim Civilisations]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aku.edu/ismc/faculty/pages/profile.aspx?ProfileID=32&amp;Name=Leif%20Stenberg ISMC-AKU staff page]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Aga_Khan_University|Aga Khan University]] (International) in London. He is the former director of the [[Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Lund University]]. Leif Stenberg received his [[B.A]] degree from [[Lund University]] in 1987 and wrote his doctoral thesis on the Islamization of science, supervised by [[Jan Hjärpe]], in 1996. Stenberg's work has been influenced by both [[Jan Hjärpe]] and [[Michel Foucault]], which is apparent in his doctoral thesis, where Foucauldian concepts and definitions are used.&lt;ref name=doctoral&gt;Stenberg, L. (1996). ''The Islamization of Science: Four Muslim Positions Developing an Islamic Modernity''. Coronet Books {{ISBN|91-22-01723-2}} available online at [http://www.cmes.lu.se/2009/08/11/the-islamization-of-science/ the CMES homepage]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His interests also include contemporary Sufism, which he has been actively researching since the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Bornholm Helena ''Mellanöstern i en Samtida Värld'' Tvärsnitt 2009 available [http://www.vr.se/huvudmeny/tvarsnittnr32009/essamellanosterniensamtidavarld.4.227c330c123c73dc58680002602.html online (in Swedish)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612160003/http://www.vr.se/huvudmeny/tvarsnittnr32009/essamellanosterniensamtidavarld.4.227c330c123c73dc58680002602.html# |date=2011-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Stenberg criticised the ''Rosengårdsrapporten'' report by security expert [[Magnus Ranstorp]] which contained assertions that there was a growing jihadist movement in the [[Rosengård]] suburb in Malmö as being "full of prejudice" and lacking academic depth. This criticism turned into controversy when it in 2016 turned out that terrorist [[Osama Krayem]] had grown up in the area.&lt;ref name="sr12apr2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hade Rosengårdsrapporten rätt?|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1637&amp;artikel=6409483|website=Sveriges Radio|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="110357">{{caution|The term genocide is contentious and its academic definition varies. This list only considers mass killings recognized as genocides ''by the legal definition'' in significant scholarship and  criteria by the UN Genocide Convention}}
&lt;!--DO NOT add genocides that clearly do not meet the UN criteria, ie, killing of economic or political groups, or "cultural genocides/ethnocides." Provide sources that demonstrate the genocide is recognized as such by significant mainstream scholarship under the most common definition (the legal definition) of genocide. Remember wikipedia is not a [[WP:SOAPBOX]]. For highest and lowest estimates, do not use unreliable sources or sources which give significantly different figures than mainstream research. --&gt;

This '''list of genocides by death toll''' includes death toll estimates of all deaths that are either directly or indirectly caused by [[genocide]]. It does not include non strictly-genocidal mass killing (variously called [[mass murder]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[politicide]], [[policide]], [[classicide]], [[war crimes]]) such as the [[Thirty Years War]] (7.5 million deaths), [[Japanese war crimes]] (3 to 14 million deaths), the [[Red Terror]] (100,000 to 1.3 million deaths), the [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State]] (1 to 15 million deaths), the [[Great Purge]] (0.6 to 1.75 million death), or the [[Great Leap Forward]] (15 to 55 million deaths).

The United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=https://www.un.org/ar/preventgenocide/adviser/pdf/osapg_analysis_framework.pdf|title=Analysis Framework: Legal definition of genocide|work=Office of the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide (OSAPG)|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other definitions can be found in scholarly literature and national law of different countries.

As R.J. Rummel writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The human death toll over only 267 days was incredible. Just to give for five out of the eighteen districts some incomplete statistics published in Bangladesh newspapers or by an Inquiry Committee, the Pakistani army killed 100,000 Bengalis in Dacca, 150,000 in Khulna, 75,000 in Jessore, 95,000 in Comilla, and 100,000 in Chittagong. For eighteen districts the total is 1,247,000 killed. This was an incomplete toll, and to this day no one really knows the final toll. Some estimates of the democide [Rummel's 'death by government'] are much lower—one is of 300,000 dead—but most range from 1 million to 3 million. ... The Pakistani army and allied paramilitary groups killed about one out of every sixty-one people in Pakistan overall; one out of every twenty-five Bengalis, Hindus, and others in East Pakistan. If the rate of killing for all of Pakistan is annualized over the years the Yahya martial law regime was in power (March 1969 to December 1971), then this one regime was more lethal than that of the Soviet Union, China under the communists, or Japan under the military (even through World War II)."

Myanmar's military forces immediately launched a series of retaliatory attacks against Rohingya civilians, and were joined by local Buddhist extremists. Together they burnt down hundreds of Rohingya villages, killed thousands of Rohingya men, women, and children, tortured countless others, and sexually assaulted countless Rohingya women and girls. Several Rohingya refugees say they were forced to witness soldiers throwing their babies into burning houses to die in the fire. Numerous Rohingya refugee women and girls have provided accounts of being brutally gang raped. The violence has resulted in a refugee crisis, with an estimated 693,000 Rohingya fleeing to overcrowded refugee camps in the neighboring country of Bangladesh.}}

&lt;!--&lt;ref name=holocaustestimates&gt;Early efforts by scholars to determine the number of Jews murdered by the Nazis were limited by a lack of access to pertinent records. The genocide seldom entered Western discourse, both due to ignorance and to the Cold-War politics which made West Germany a new ally of the United States.The first significant work on the subject published in English was [[Gerald Reitlinger]]'s ''Final Solution'' (1953), which, relying almost exclusively on German documentation, estimated 4.9 million dead. This figure is now considered extremely conservative. [[Raul Hilberg]]'s 1961 ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'' became a classic in the field of Holocaust literature and made the genocide of the Jews known to the wider public, Hilberg estimated its victims to be 5.1 million lives, or 4.9 - 5.4 million broadly construed. The [[Adolf Eichmann#Trial|trial of Adolph Eichmann]] further raised awareness of the genocide, Eichmann also provided documentation and testimony which revised the number of the dead.The first work to arrive at a figure comparable to modern estimates was [[Lucy Dawidowicz]]'s ''[[The War Against the Jews]]'', published in 1975, the book provided detailed listings by country of the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust which are still used as a reference in modern Holocaust studies. Dawidowicz researched birth and death records in many cities of prewar Europe to come up with a death toll of 5,933,900 Jews. After the opening of Soviet records, scholarship arrived at a death toll of about 6 million Jews. Gutman and Rozett's [[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]] was published in 1990 and estimated slightly over 5.9 million Jews were murdered.[[Wolfgang Benz]]'s ''The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide'', published 1995, gave a toll of 6.2 million.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Ani's 1994 work, ''Yurugu: An Afrikan-Centered Critique of European Cultural Thought and Behavior'', examined the influence of European culture on the formation of modern institutional frameworks, through [[colonialism]] and [[imperialism]], from an African perspective.&lt;ref name="Bush2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ConferenceAsumah2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=New York African Studies Association.

}}
Examining the causes of global [[white supremacy]], Ani argued that European thought implicitly believes in its own superiority, stating: "European culture is unique in the assertion of political interest".&lt;ref name="Bush2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Melanie E. L. Bush|title=Breaking the Code of Good Intentions: everyday forms of whiteness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNoky-bvSr0C&amp;pg=PA28|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=July 28, 2004|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-2864-2|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Yurugu'', Ani proposed a tripartite conceptualization of culture, based on the concepts of 
#''Asili'', the central seed or "germinating matrix" of a culture,
#''Utamawazo'', "culturally structured thought" or worldview, "the way in which the thought of members of a culture must be patterned if the ''asili'' is to be fulfilled", and
#''Utamaroho'', a culture's "vital force" or "energy source", which "gives it its emotional tone and motivates the collective behavior of its members".&lt;ref name="Hawthorne2002-17-19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Howe1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ani1994xxv"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ani|title=Yurugu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBxmAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=September 17, 2011|year=1994|publisher=|page=xxv|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms Ani uses in this framework are based on [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. ''Asili'' is a common Swahili word meaning "origin" or "essence"; ''utamawazo'' and ''utamaroho'' are neologisms created by Ani, based on the Swahili words ''utamaduni'' ("civilisation"), ''wazo'' ("thought") and ''roho'' ("spirit life").&lt;ref name="Howe1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mazrui2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alamin M. Mazrui|title=English in Africa: after the Cold War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bAYAaa2IwCcC&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=4 July 2011|year=2004|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=978-1-85359-689-6|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawthorne2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Hawthorne|title=Wild politics: feminism, globalisation, bio/diversity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Um-ImUBOIb4C&amp;pg=PA388|accessdate=4 July 2011|year=2002|publisher=Spinifex Press|isbn=978-1-876756-24-6|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''utamawazo'' and ''utamaroho'' are not viewed as separate from the ''asili'', but as its manifestations, which are "born out of the ''asili'' and, in turn, affirm it."&lt;ref name="Ani1994xxv"/&gt;

Ani characterised the ''asili'' of European culture as dominated by the concepts of separation and control, with separation establishing dichotomies like "man" and "nature", "the European" and "the other", "thought" and "emotion" – separations that in effect end up negating the existence of "the other", who or which becomes subservient to the needs of (European) man.&lt;ref name="Hawthorne2002-17-19" /&gt; Control is disguised in universalism as in reality "the use of abstract 'universal' formulations in the European experience has been to control people, to impress them, and to intimidate them."&lt;ref name="Ani199472"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ani|title=Yurugu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBxmAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=January 19, 2012|year=1994|publisher=|page=72|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ani's model, the ''utamawazo'' of European culture "is structured by ideology and bio-cultural experience", and its ''utamaroho'' or vital force is domination, reflected in all European-based structures and the imposition of Western values and civilisation on peoples around the world, destroying cultures and languages in the name of progress.&lt;ref name="Hawthorne2002-17-19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Higgs2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Higgs|title=African Voices in Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaoOhJIZ5ZoC|accessdate=4 July 2011|year=2000|publisher=Juta and Company Ltd|isbn=978-0-7021-5199-6|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also addresses the use of the term [[Maafa]], based on a Swahili word meaning "great disaster", to describe [[slavery]].  [[African-centered]] thinkers have subsequently popularized and expanded on Ani's conceptualization.&lt;ref name="Dagbovie2010" /&gt; Citing both the centuries-long history of slavery and more recent examples like the [[Tuskegee study]], Ani argued that Europeans and white ''Americans'' have an "enormous capacity for the perpetration of physical violence against other cultures" that had resulted in "antihuman, genocidal" treatment of blacks.&lt;ref name="Dagbovie2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pero Gaglo Dagbovie|title=African American History Reconsidered|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMum6d1bX-cC&amp;pg=PA191|accessdate=July 4, 2011|date=15 March 2010|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-07701-2|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ani1994427434"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ani|title=Yurugu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBxmAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=September 17, 2011|year=1994|publisher=|pages=427, 434|isbn=978-0-86543-248-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
Philip Higgs, in ''African Voices in Education'', describes ''Yurugu'' as an "excellent delineation of the ethics of harmonious coexistence between human beings", but cites the book's "overlooking of structures of social inequality and conflict that one finds in all societies, including indigenous ones," as a weakness.&lt;ref name="Higgs2000"/&gt;{{rp|175}} [[Molefi Kete Asante]] describes ''Yurugu'' as an "elegant work".&lt;ref&gt;[[Molefi Kete Asante]], "[https://books.google.com/books?id=bsayWnizUD0C&amp;pg=PA198 Afrocentricity, Race, and Reason]", in [[Manning Marable]], ed., ''Dispatches from the Ebony Tower: intellectuals confront the African American experience'' (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2000), {{ISBN|978-0-231-11477-6}}, page=198. Accessed: July 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Howe accuses Ani of having little interest in actual Africa (beyond romance) and challenges her critique of "Eurocentric" logic, since she invests heavily in its usage in the book.&lt;ref name="Howe1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Howe|title=Afrocentrism: mythical pasts and imagined homes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFrm19cZhugC&amp;pg=PA247|accessdate=July 4, 2011|year=1999|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-228-7|pages=247–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Judicial interpretation}}
The '''mischief rule'''&lt;ref&gt;http://legal-directory.net/english-law/interpretation-mischief-rule.htm&lt;/ref&gt; is one of three rules of statutory interpretation traditionally applied by English courts.&lt;ref&gt;"The notion has long prevailed that three different rules or approaches may be employed in ascertaining the meaning of a statute. First, there is said to be the "purpose" approach or "mischief rule"... Then there is said to be the "literal" approach or "plain meaning" rule... Finally there is what is called the "golden rule"... Source: Elmer Driedger, ''Construction of Statutes''. Toronto: Butterworths, 1983, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The other two are the "[[plain meaning rule]]" (also known as the "literal rule") and the "[[golden rule (law)|golden rule]]".

The main aim of the rule is to determine the "mischief and defect" that the statute in question has set out to remedy, and what ruling would effectively implement this remedy. In applying the mischief rule, the court is essentially asking what part of the law did the law not cover, but was meant to be rectified by Parliament in passing the bill.

The rule was first laid out in a 16th-century ruling of the [[Exchequer of Pleas|Exchequer Court]].

==Meaning and use==
''Conway v Rimmer'' is a [[rules of construction|rule of construction]] that judges can apply in statutory interpretation in order to discover Parliament's intention. In applying the rule, the court is essentially asking what the mischief was that the previous law did not cover, which Parliament was seeking to remedy when it passed the law now being reviewed by the court.

The mischief rule is of narrower application than the [[golden rule (law)|golden rule]] or the [[plain meaning]] rule, in that it can only be used to interpret a statute and, strictly speaking, only when the statute was passed to remedy a defect in the common law.

Legislative intent is determined by examining secondary sources, such as committee reports, treatises, law review articles and corresponding statutes.

The application of this rule gives the judge more discretion than the literal and the golden rule as it allows him to effectively decide on Parliament's intent. It can be argued that this undermines Parliament's supremacy and is undemocratic as it takes law-making decisions away from the legislature.

The way in which the mischief rule can produce more sensible outcomes than those that would result if the literal rule were applied is illustrated by the ruling in ''Smith v Hughes'' [1960] 2 All E.R. 859. Under the [[Street Offences Act 1959]], it was a crime for prostitutes to "loiter or solicit in the street for the purposes of prostitution". The defendants were calling to men in the street from balconies and tapping on windows. They claimed they were not guilty as they were not in the "street". The judge applied the mischief rule to come to the conclusion that they were guilty as the intention of the act was to cover the mischief of harassment from prostitutes.

==History==
The rule was first set out in ''[[Heydon's Case]]'' [1584] 76 ER 637 3 CO REP 7a&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Exch/1584/J36.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swarb.co.uk/lisc/LitiP12001799.php&lt;/ref&gt; where the court ruled that there were four points to be taken into consideration when interpreting a statute:

{{quote|For the sure and true interpretation of all statutes in general (be they penal or beneficial, restrictive or enlarging of the common law), four things are to be discerned and considered:

1st. What was the common law before the making of the Act.

2nd. What was the mischief and defect for which the common law did not provide.

3rd. What remedy the Parliament hath resolved and appointed to cure the disease of the commonwealth.

And, 4th. The true reason of the remedy;

And then the office of all the Judges is to make such construction as shall suppress the mischief, and advance the remedy, and to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for continuance of the mischief, and ''pro privato commodo'', and to add force and life to the cure and remedy, according to the true intent of the makers of the Act, ''[[pro bono|pro bono publico]]''.}}

==Traditional use==
In the century in which it was created, and for some time thereafter, the mischief rule was used in a legislative environment very different from the one which has prevailed in the past two centuries. As [[Elmer Driedger]] notes,

{{quote|[S]ixteenth-century common law judges ... looked upon statutes as a gloss upon the common law, even as an intrusion into their domain. Hence, statutes were viewed from the point of view of their effect upon the common law, as adding to it, subtracting from it or patching it up....

Then also, in the time of ''Heydon's Case'', the judges paid more attention to the "spirit" of the law than to the letter. Having found the mischief they proceeded to make mischief with the words of the statute. They remodelled the statute, by taking things out and putting things in, in order to fit the "mischief" and "defect" as they had found them.&lt;ref&gt;Elmer Driedger, ''The Construction of Statutes''. Second Edition. Toronto: Butterworths, 1983, pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Modern use==
Modern courts continue to apply the rule in a more restricted manner, and generally with a greater regard for the integrity of the statutes which they are interpreting. Driedger puts it this way: "[T]o this day, ''Heydon's Case'' is frequently cited. The courts still look for the 'mischief' and 'remedy', but now use what they find as aids to discover the meaning of what the legislature has said rather than to change it."&lt;ref&gt; Elmer Driedger, ''The Construction of Statutes''. Second Edition. Toronto: Butterworths, 1983, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Driedger goes on to argue that this modern use of the mischief rule ought to be understood as one of the components of what he characterized as the "modern" method of statutory construction, rather than a stand-alone rule serving (as it formerly had), as an alternative to the methods of construction proposed by the plain meaning rule and the golden rule.

== Advantages ==
* In a [[common law]] jurisdiction, the existence of precedent and the knock-on effects of construing a statute prevent misuse of the rule
* The Law Commission sees it as a far more satisfactory way of interpreting acts as opposed to the golden or literal rules
* It usually avoids unjust or absurd results in sentencing
* It is consistent with parliament sovereignty

== Disadvantages ==
* It is seen to be out of date as it has been in use since the 16th century, when common law was the primary source of law and parliamentary supremacy was not established
* It gives too much power to the unelected judiciary which is argued to be undemocratic
* In the 16th century, the judiciary would often draft acts on behalf of the king and were therefore well qualified in what mischief the act was meant to remedy. This is not often the case in modern legal systems.
* The rule can make the law uncertain

'''New Fathers 4 Justice''' is a UK-based direct action [[Fathers' rights movement|fathers' rights]] group campaigning for the rights of fathers to see their children. It is a splinter group of [[Fathers 4 Justice]].

New Fathers 4 Justice has a policy of not charging its supporters a fee, as they feel that dads need as much money and resource during the trying times of separation and divorce.

==History==

New Fathers 4 Justice (NF4J) is a fathers' rights group. It was founded in September 2008 by disgruntled activists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stanesby denies F4J protest will end|url=http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Stanesby-denies-F4J-protest-end/story-12695069-detail/story.html|accessdate=8 September 2008|publisher=Plymouth Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were left awaiting trial when [[Fathers 4 Justice]] was shut down by Matt O'Connor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fathers campaign continues|url=http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Fathers-campaign-continues/story-12325160-detail/story.html|accessdate=16 September 2008|agency=Western Daily Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first protest was held on 19 September 2008 in [[Bristol]], at the constituency office of Labour MP and Health Minister [[Dawn Primarolo]]. The protest was motivated by Primarolo's support of the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008|Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act of 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Embryology protesters confronted|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/7625791.stm|accessdate=19 September 2009|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA notice}}
'''''Orihon''''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 折本, [[Hepburn Romanization| Hepburn]]: Orihon, {{IPA-ja|oɾihoɴ}}) is a book style originating from the Tang dynasty (A.D. 618-908) in China and was later developed in the Heian period (A.D. 794-1185) in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Binding Beauty: Conserving a Collection of Japanese Printed Books

== History ==
[[File:Livre-eventail-Japon.jpg|320px|right|Livre-eventail-Japon]]The development of orihon began in China but later took on an association with [[Japanese books]], as shown by its current name. "The development of alternatives to the roll in China is difficult to date, but it appears that at some time during the Tang period long rolls consisting of sheets of paper pasted together began to be folded alternately one way and the other to produce an effect like a [[concertina]]. It has been supposed that this form was suggested by the palm-leaf books which transmitted Buddhist texts from India to China. However that may be, it is in any case a fact that the concertina form was primarily used in China, and subsequently in Japan, for Buddhist texts. Books of this format are called orihon 折本 in Japan, and the format survived until the nineteenth century and beyond for printed Buddhist sūtras and occasionally for other books, such as reference lists, calendars, and folding maps."&lt;ref&gt;The Book in Japan: A Cultural History from the Beginnings to the Nineteenth Century by Peter Kornicki, p. 43. Retrieved from http://www.printsofjapan.com/Index_Glossary_O_thru_Ri.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Laura C. Liberman notes in an article that the accordion book style used in Tibet traces back to orihon origins.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;Lieberman, Laura C. "The Robert C. Williams American Museum of Papermaking." JAB: The Journal of Artist's Books 15 (2001): 12-13. ProQuest. Web. 11 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===
The combination of characters are borrowed from Chinese, which originally translates the phrase to "a loss" or "a loss of money." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.purpleculture.net/dictionary_details/?word=折本|title = Chinese Word - 折本|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when looking at the individual characters, a different meaning is found. The Traditional Chinese characters are defined as 折 meaning "to break (e.g. stick or bone); a loss"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.purpleculture.net/dictionary-details/?word=折|title = Meaning of 折|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 本 meaning "roots or stems of plants; origin; source; this; the current; root; foundation; basis; classifier for books, periodicals, files etc originally,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.purpleculture.net/dictionary-details/?word=本|title = Meaning of 本|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it means a breakdown of a book. In Japanese, it combines the roots "ori" (fold) and "hon" (book).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wordsense.eu/本/&lt;/ref&gt; Edith Diehl describes orihon as a general Asian style and translates it to "stabbed binding."&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, Edith. "Primative Records and Ancient Book Forms." Bookbinding; Its Background and Technique. New York: Rinehart &amp;, 1946. 12. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uses ===
Cyril James Humphries Davenport notes in his 1898 lecture that "writing upon a roll was found to be the most convenient at a very early date by the Chinese, Japanese and [K]oreans, they were also the first to find out that if the rolls were simply folded backwards and forwards between the "pages" of writing or printing, the whole book became easier to read, and this form, known as "Orihon," is used in those countries to the present day."&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Cyril. "Lecture 1." Cantor Lectures on Decorative Bookbinding. London: Printed by William Trounce, 10, Gough Square, Fleet Street, E.C., 1898. 2. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional orihon books are associated with Japanese Buddhist works and [[e-hon]], or picture books. Modern applications are found in artistic modes, such as Tom Burtonwood's 2013 plastic rendering using a 3-D printer.&lt;ref&gt;http://tomburtonwood.com/portfolio-item/orihon-3d-printed-book/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Orihon-crop.png|framed|right|Utagawa Hiroshige (Japanese, 1797-1858) ''Sakkyo Kageboshi Zukushi'' (Collection of Improvised Silhouette Plays) n.d.]] --&gt;Orihon consist of a long strip of paper that is written on one side and then compacted by folding in zig-zag fashion. The orihon format is considered a step between a [[scroll]] and a [[codex]].

The style of folding is similar to that of the air bellows of a [[concertina]] or [[accordion]], such that every written page faces another written page when the book is closed. It may therefore be opened to any page.&lt;ref&gt;https://art2551.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/book_demo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It may have a cover attached to the front and back end sections of the book. Diehl describes orihon as having stabbed holes in the back cover to allow the book to be "laced."&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, Edith. "Primative Records and Ancient Book Forms." Bookbinding; Its Background and Technique. New York: Rinehart &amp;, 1946. 12. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''prebound''' [[book]] is a book that was previously bound and has been rebound with a [[library]] quality hardcover [[book binding|binding]]. In almost all commercial cases, the book in question began as a [[paperback]] version.

An alternate term is "Library Hardcover Paperback".

'''Prefabricated homes''', often referred to as '''prefab homes''' or simply '''prefabs''', are specialist dwelling types of [[prefabricated building]], which are manufactured off-site in advance, usually in standard sections that can be easily shipped and assembled. Some current prefab home designs include architectural details inspired by [[postmodernism]] or [[futurist architecture]].

==Word origin==
[[File:"Loren" Iron House, Old Gippstown.JPG|thumb|"Loren" Iron House, at [[Old Gippstown]] in [[Moe, Victoria|Moe]], Australia]]
The word ‘prefab’ is not an industry term like [[modular home]], [[manufactured home]], panelized home or site-built home. The term is an amalgamation of panelized and modular building systems, and can mean either one. In today's usage the term ‘prefab’ is more closely related to the style of home, usually modernist, rather than to a particular method of home construction.

==Prefabricated housing==
[[File:South Parkway2.jpg|thumb|right|Uninhabited prefabricated [[council houses]] in [[Seacroft]], [[Leeds]], [[UK]]]]
‘Prefabricated’ may refer to buildings built in components (e.g. panels), modules ([[modular home]]s) or transportable sections ([[manufactured home]]s), and may also be used to refer to [[mobile home]]s, i.e., houses on wheels. Although similar, the methods and design of the three vary widely. There are two-level home plans, as well as [[custom home]] plans. There are considerable differences in the construction types. In the U.S., mobile and manufactured houses are constructed in accordance with [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] building codes, while modular houses are constructed in accordance with the IRC (International Residential Code).

*Modular homes are created in sections, and then transported to the home site for construction and installation. These are typically installed and treated like a regular house, for financing, appraisal and construction purposes, and are usually the most expensive of the three. Although the sections of the house are prefabricated, the sections, or modules, are put together at the construction much like a typical home. Manufactured homes, once placed on a permanent foundation, are considered the same as modular or site build homes for appraisal purposes.
*Manufactured homes are built onto steel beams, and are transported in complete sections to the home site, where they are assembled. Wheels, hitch and axles are removed on site when the home is placed on a permanent foundation.
*Mobile homes, or trailers, are built on wheels, that can be pulled by a vehicle. They are considered to be personal property, and are licensed by the Dept. of Motor Vehicles. "Tiny homes", which are gaining in popularity, are within this category. They must be built to the DMV code, and pass inspection for licensing.

Mobile homes and manufactured homes can be placed in mobile home parks, and manufactured homes can also be placed on private land, unless the land is within a subdivision whose CC&amp;Rs prohibit manufactured housing.

[[File:Prefab2.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of a preserved prefab at [[St Fagans National History Museum]], [[Cardiff]], [[UK]]]]

===Manufactured homes===
{{Main|Manufactured housing}}
Constructing manufactured homes typically involves connecting plumbing and electrical lines across the sections, and sealing the sections together. Manufactured homes can be single, double or triple-wide, describing how many sections wide it is. Many manufactured home companies manufacture a variety of different designs, and many of the floorplans are available online. Manufactured homes can be built onto a permanent foundation, and if designed correctly, can be difficult to distinguish from a stick-built home to the untrained eye. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Manufactured homes are typically purchased from a retail sales company, initially assembled by a local contracting company, and follow-up repairs performed by the manufactured home company under warranty.

A manufactured home, once assembled, goes through a ‘settling-in’ period, where the home will settle into its location. During this period, some drywall cracking may appear, and any incorrectly installed appliances, wiring or plumbing should be repaired, hopefully under warranty. If not covered under warranty, the costs will be borne by the consumer. For this reason, it is important that the consumer ensure that a reputable and honest contractor is used for the initial set-up. If any repairs are not completed by the initial set-up crew, the manufacturer will send repair crews to repair anything covered by the warranty. The secondary repair team must be scheduled, and may not be available immediately for most repairs. Just because a manufactured home has been assembled does not mean it is immediately habitable; appropriate ventilation, heating, plumbing, and electrical systems must be installed by a set-up crew, otherwise, the buyer must wait for the manufacturer repair team or do it themselves.

==History==
The first prefabricated homes and movable structures were invented in 16th century in India by Akbar. These structures were reported by Arif Qandahari in 1579.&lt;ref&gt;Irfan Habib (1992), "Akbar and Technology", ''Social Scientist'' '''20''' (9-10): 3-15 [3-4]&lt;/ref&gt;
It can be proved that the first mention of a prefabricated building was in 1160 to 1170 by [[Wace]] as confirmed by [[Pierre Bouet]]. In the special May/June 2015 edition of the French magazine ''Historia'', he spoke of a castle transported by [[Norman people|Normans]] in 'kit' form. According to Bouet, Wace's epic poem [[Roman de Rou]], verses 6,516–6,526, states: "They took out of the ship beams of wood and dragged them to the ground. Then the Count (Earl) who brought them, (the beams) already pierced and planed, carved and trimmed, the pegs (raw-plugs/dowels) already trimmed and transported in barrels, erected a castle, had a moat dug around it and thus had constructed a big fortress during the night."

===North America===
Wooden homes have always been popular in [[North America]], due to the large quantity of timber available in North America. In the United States, several companies including [[Sears Catalog Homes]] began offering mail-order kit homes between 1902 and 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Whole Kit and Caboodle |date=2002-02-07 |work=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A33707-2002Feb6?language=printer |accessdate=2011-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, more than 156,000 prefabricated homes were built between 1945 and 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The century makers: 1945 |date=2003-10-11 |work=The Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/newhomes/3318114/The-century-makers-1945.html |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the World War II until 1948, Sell-Fertighaus GmbH built over 5,000 prefabricated houses in Germany for the occupying force of the United States.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

====United States====
[[File:Modular Log Exterior.jpg|thumb|right|A modern North American log style prefabricated house]]
The prefab house requires much less labor compared to conventional houses. Most of the companies{{Clarify|date=October 2016}} sell pre-manufactured modular homes called ‘mobile homes’ or ‘manufactured homes’.

Local governments in North America generally have specialized regulations such as HUD regulations besides general building codes, applicable to pre-manufactured housing.

===Zoning issues===
Manufactured homes are not permitted in some communities, and therefore, a prospective homeowner should check the local construction law and zoning code pertaining to prefab homes.

==Europe==
[[File:Huf Haus in Scotland.jpg|thumb|left|German-manufactured [[Huf Haus]] near [[West Linton]], [[Scotland]]]]
There is no pan-EU housing standard for this kind of home construction, as regulation has historically been at the national government level. There are however many EU directives that do apply to housing construction and design, but these directives do not directly affect the inter-EU modular home sector due to inter-EU ''free trade'' considerations. However, each modular home is legally expected or obliged to be integrated into the local building regulations once the final construction is finished.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Prefabricated House Arnold Nottinghamshire.JPG|thumb|right|A post-Second World War English prefabricated house, adjoining a similar property reconstructed in brick]]
{{main|British post-war temporary prefab houses}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] the word ‘prefab’ is often associated with a specific type of prefabricated house built in large numbers after the [[Second World War]],&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=R.B.|author2=Colin Chant |title=The European cities and technology reader: industrial to post-industrial city Cities and technology series|editor=David C. Goodman|publisher=Routledge|year=1999 |pages=221–228|isbn=0-415-20082-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRevpyspcEMC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=prefab+house+uk+war&amp;ei=I-MgS-itN57AzgSchtTGDw&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Airey house]]s, as a temporary replacement for housing that had been destroyed by bombs, particularly in [[London]].

Despite the intention that these dwellings would be a strictly temporary measure, many remained inhabited for years and even decades after the end of the war. A small number are still in use in the 21st century, but more and more are being demolished. In 2011 it was announced that Britain’s largest remaining prefab estate of 187 homes in [[Lewisham]], South-East London, is to be redeveloped except for six homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Storr|first=Will|title=Bulldozers home in on historic prefab estate|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/8701977/Bulldozers-home-in-on-historic-prefab-estate.html|accessdate=10 March 2012|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prefabs were also built in the [[First World War]] such as the still occupied houses in [[Austin Village]], [[Birmingham]].

The latest iteration of the idea is a development of 36 apartments called y:cube made by the [[YMCA]] in [[Mitcham, London|Mitcham, South London]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ymcalsw.org/ymca-and-rshps-innovative-factory-built-affordable-housing-scheme-welcomes-first-tenants-in-south-west-london/|title=YMCA and RSH+P’s innovative factory-built affordable housing scheme welcomes first tenants in south west London - YMCA St Paul's Group|date=8 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ilke Homes, a firm in Knaresborough, opened in November 2018. It constructs 2 and 3 bedroom 'modular' homes with fitted kitchens and bathrooms, that can be erected in 36 hours instead of the traditional 40 weeks. The 40m² two bed model costs £65,000, though land and services connection is extra. They are being marketed to housing associations not individual buyers. They will make 5000 units a year. The insurance firm [[Legal and General]] is planning to produce 3500 similar houses a year. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Collinson |first1=Patrick |title='UK housebuilding revolution': £65,000 prefab homes go into production |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/30/uk-housebuilding-revolution-65000-prefab-homes-go-into-production |accessdate=30 November 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=30 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia and Asia==
[[File:Modern Transportable House.jpg|thumb|left|An Australian prefabricated house]]
There are a small number of prefab home builders in [[Australia]]. In the overall housing sector, prefab housing construction is very small as the overall rate of housing construction has been very low due to slow population growth.

The prefab sector in Australia is more optimised for exporting its product, as domestic consumption is limited.

In 2010, [[Bali]] exported 98,417 prefabicated houses, but in 2011 the country only exported 5,007 units due to the global economic slowdown that affected a number of export destinations. These Balinese prefab houses are well known for their artistic design and practical value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/80144/balis-prefab-house-exports-plunge |title=Bali`s prefab house exports plunge|date=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The future==
Prefab homes are becoming popular in [[Europe]], [[Canada]] and [[United States]] as they are relatively cheap when compared to many existing homes on the market. The 2007 finance crisis has however deflated the cost of housing in North America and Europe, so not all prefab homes should be assumed to be cheaper than existing housing.

Modern architects are experimenting with [[prefabrication]] as a means to deliver well-designed and [[mass-produced]] modern homes. Modern architecture forgoes referential decoration and instead features clean lines and open [[floor plan]]s.

Because of the design simplifications modern architecture provides (coupled with the cost savings that tend go with design simplification) many in the manufactured housing sector generally feel that [[modern architecture]] designs are better suited for prefab home construction.

'''Rape schedule''' is a concept in [[feminist theory]] used to describe the notion that women are conditioned to place restrictions on and/or make alterations to their daily lifestyles and behaviours as a result of constant fear of [[sexual assault]].  These altered behaviours may occur consciously or unconsciously.&lt;ref name="Jessica Valenti"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Valenti|first1=Jessica|title=Full Frontal Feminism|date=2007|publisher=Seal Press|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of concept==
The term ''rape schedule'' was first used in 1998 in [[Dianne Herman]]’s essay "Rape Culture."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;D. Herman, "The Rape Culture," in Changing Our Power 260 (J.W. Cochran &amp; D. Langton eds., 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; It was later made popular by [[Jessica Valenti]], through her book ''[[Full Frontal Feminism.]]''&lt;ref&gt;Valenti, Jessica. ''Full Frontal Feminism: A Young Woman's Guide to Why Feminism Matters''. Seal Press, (2007). 63&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept has since been cited and discussed by feminist scholars across disciplines, including criminologist [[Jody Miller (criminologist)|Jody Miller]], lawyer [[Catharine Mackinnon]], and philosopher [[Susan Griffin]]. These individuals have speculated on the impact of rape schedule on women’s freedom, access to rights, relationships with others, and self worth.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine A MacKinnon, Sex Equality, Foundation Press (2007) 339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R. Gold's review of: Sex, Power, Conflict: Evolutionary and Feminist Perspectives, Edited by David M. Buss and Neil M. Malamuth. Oxford University, Press, New York, 1996 as cited in 'Theories of Rape' http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/vaw00/theories_of_rape.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rape Culture|url=http://homepage.smc.edu/delpiccolo_guido/soc1/soc1readings/rape%20culture_final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
=== Statistical context ===
Statistical analysis based on victim reporting can be used to demonstrate the prevalence of sexual assault in the United States.  According to the 2015 National Crime Victimization Survey, on average, 321,500 people aged 12 or older in the US are raped or assaulted each year.  Among this population, women are more likely to be raped than men: 1 in 6 women will experience an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime, compared with 1 in 33 men.&lt;ref name="RAINN Sexual Violence Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Victims of Sexual Violence: Statistics {{!}} RAINN|url=https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence|website=www.rainn.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 91% of victims of rape and sexual assault are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf|title = Statistics About Violence|date = |accessdate = |website = NSVRC|publisher = National Sexual Violence Resource Center|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These statistics are also influenced by sexuality:
*46.4% of lesbian women and 40.2% gay men;
*74.9% of bisexual women and 47.4% bisexual men;
*and 43.4% of heterosexual women and 20.8% heterosexual men
have reported experiencing some form of sexual violence in their lifetime, according to the [[National Sexual Violence Resource Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf|title = Statistics About Violence|date = |accessdate = |website = NSVRC|publisher = National Sexual Violence Resource Center|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age also influences rates of sexual assault.  For example, when compared with the overall national average for women, women aged 18-24 who are college students are three times as likely to be victims of sexual assault; women in the same age group that are not attending college are four times as likely to experience sexual assault.&lt;ref name="RAINN Campus Sexual Violence"&gt;{{cite web|title=Campus Sexual Violence: Statistics {{!}} RAINN|url=https://www.rainn.org/statistics/campus-sexual-violence|website=www.rainn.org|accessdate=21 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape is one of the most underreported crimes in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf|title = Statistics About Violence|date = |accessdate = |website = NSVRC|publisher = National Sexual Violence Resource Center|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Privilege ===
A [[privilege (sociology)|privilege]] is a right or advantage granted to a specific population that is not allowed to others.&lt;ref name="Definition of PRIVILEGE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of PRIVILEGE|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/privilege|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=21 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a sociological model, [[privilege (sociology)]] outlines the ways that these advantages are results of larger societal systems and demonstrative of [[social inequality]].&lt;ref name="A Structural Definition Of Social Privilege {{!}} MSS Research"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Structural Definition Of Social Privilege {{!}} MSS Research|url=https://www.mssresearch.org/?q=Structural_Definition_of_Social_Privilege|website=www.mssresearch.org|publisher=MSS Research|accessdate=21 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of privilege can be found through the lenses of:&lt;ref name="A Structural Definition Of Social Privilege {{!}} MSS Research"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Structural Definition Of Social Privilege {{!}} MSS Research|url=https://www.mssresearch.org/?q=Structural_Definition_of_Social_Privilege|website=www.mssresearch.org|publisher=MSS Research|accessdate=21 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Sexuality]]

*[[Religion]]
*[[Job|Occupation]]
 
These lenses of privilege can be applied in considering the use of rape schedule. For example, [[Jody Miller (criminologist)|Jody Miller]] has explained that prostitutes cannot adhere to a rape schedule as it would leave them 'unable to work'-- adhering to a rape schedule in this manner could be seen to be 'born of privilege'.&lt;ref&gt;Jody Miller, "Researching Violence Against Street Prostitutes: Issues of Epistemology, Methodology, and Ethics" in
Researching Sexual Violence Against Women: Methodological and Personal Perspectives (Martin D. Schwartz ed.,
1997). 144, 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==

=== Fear ===
Fear of sexual assault is a commonly shared sentiment among many individuals in today's society, especially women.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; Rape schedule dictates that this fear often forces individuals to make alterations within their everyday life, shifting routines and limiting activity to conform with a level of invisibility that will provide protection. Examples of this behavior includes taking specific routes home, being indoors by specific hours of the night, avoiding going places alone, or dressing in a specific manner.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Emmy|title=Living Life By A Rape Schedule|url=http://feminspire.tumblr.com/post/55266056616/living-life-by-a-rape-schedule|website=Feminspire|accessdate=2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, fear functions as both a cause and effect. 

=== Mental and emotional impact ===
In the 1970s, a term known as [[Rape Trauma Syndrome]] was introduced by [[Ann Wolbert Burgess]] and [[Lynda Lytle Holmstrom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Violation and trauma in historical perspective|url=http://arbor.revistas.csic.es/index.php/arbor/article/view/808/815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape can lead to mental health disorders, such as [[PTSD]], and statistical evidence demonstrates this trend. According to Dean G. Kilpatrick, from the [[National Violence Against Women Prevention Research Center]], 31% of all rape victims develop some form of PTSD at some point in their lifetime and those who were victims of rape were “6.2 times more likely to develop PTSD than women who had never been victims of crime". Victims were also three times more likely than those who had not been sexual assaulted to experience a major depressive episode, 13.4 times more likely to have two or more major alcohol problems, and 26 times more likely to have two or more serious drug abuse problems.&lt;ref name=Kilpatrick&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilpatrick|first1=Dean G.|title=The Mental Health Impact of Rape|url=https://mainweb-v.musc.edu/vawprevention/research/mentalimpact.shtml|website=University of South Carolina|publisher=National Violence Against Women Prevention Research Center|accessdate=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of these severe incidents, women develop rape schedules to help them try to avoid the possibility of rape occurring in the future.  As a result of these fear-based rape schedules, women can be left feeling powerless, which can have an extremely debilitating impact on women’s self-worth.&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gold|first1=Stephen R.|title=Review of: Sex, Power, Conflict: Evolutionary and Feminist Perspectives|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vulnerability ===
Despite adherence to any form of rape schedule, women are not guaranteed safety from the threat of sexual assault. Despite precaution, they can still be left and feel vulnerable, a phenomenon largely experienced by women and less universally by men.&lt;ref name="Valenti"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Valenti|first1=Jessica|title=Full Frontal Feminism|date=2007|publisher=Seal Press|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an informal survey mentioned by Mary Dickson in her article, "A Woman's Worst Nightmare", many men reported that they do not feel fear when walking down the street. A man stated "as a man, I'm afraid of very little."  However, in that same survey, women listed numerous things they feared. One female responded, "I'm always afraid in a situation where there's somebody that could overpower me easily. I lock my doors, park in lighted areas, don't run in dark areas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Woman's Worst Nightmare|url = https://www.pbs.org/kued/nosafeplace/articles/nightmare.html|website = www.pbs.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This informal survey suggests that especially in these particular situations, women feel a great deal more vulnerable than men.

The sculpture of '''''Samson Slaying a Philistine''''' is the earliest of the great marble groups by [[Giambologna]], sculptor to the [[Medici]] [[Grand Dukes of Tuscany]], and the only substantial work by the artist to have left Italy. It was commissioned in about 1562, by [[Francesco de' Medici]] for a fountain in [[Florence]], but was later sent as a gift to Spain being placed in [[Palacio de la Ribera]], Valladolid. The group was presented to the Prince of Wales, later [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], in 1623 while he was in Spain negotiating a marriage contract, and it soon became the most famous Italian sculpture in England. On its arrival in England it was given to the king's favourite, the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], and subsequently changed hands three times before coming to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 1954.

The sculpture shows [[Samson]] wielding the jawbone of an ass in order to slay one of the [[Philistine]]s who have taunted him. It is a good example of the multiple viewpoints seen in Giambologna's work; the spiralling movement of the bodies means that there is no main view. The dramatic pose is based on a composition by [[Michelangelo]], who was in his late seventies when Giambologna met him in Rome. The group was carved from just one block of marble, supported by only five narrow points. Although the marble is weathered from three centuries outdoors, it still shows Giambologna's sensitive carving.

The '''status quo of the Holy Land sites''' is an understanding among religious communities with respect to nine shared religious sites in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Bethlehem]].{{sfn|UN Conciliation Commission|1949|p=7}} Other Holy Places in Israel and Palestine were not deemed subject to the Status Quo because the authorities of one religion or of one community within a religion are in recognized or effective possession.{{sfn|UN Conciliation Commission|1949|p=7a|ps=: "As for example the [[Cenacle]] which, though a Christian Holy Place, has been in Moslem hands since the middle of the 16th century. The position that Christians do not in effect enjoy the right to hold services there is uncontested."}}

It resulted from a ''[[firman]]'' (decree) of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Osman III]] in 1757&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209 Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia,  edited by Michael Dumper, Bruce E. Stanley P 209]&lt;/ref&gt; that preserved the division of ownership and responsibilities of various sites important to Christians, Muslims, and Jews to their then-current holders or owners, and represented agreements among the various religions that nothing could be changed from the way it was without upsetting the balance of order in maintaining the religious sites for visits by pilgrims. A further firman issued in 1852 and another one from 1853 reaffirmed the provisions of the 1757 decree.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Maurer Morio, ''What does Status Quo stand for?'', in History of Latin Patriarchate, on the website of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem [http://en.lpj.org/2014/11/24/what-does-status-quo-stand-for/]&lt;/ref&gt; The actual provisions of the ''[[status quo]]'' were never formally established in a single document, but the 1929 summary prepared by [[Lionel George Archer Cust|L. G. A. Cust]], a civil servant of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], ''The Status Quo in the Holy Places'', became the standard text on the subject.{{sfn|Cust|1929}}&lt;ref name="BregerReiter2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Breger |first1=Marshall J. |last2=Reiter |first2=Yitzhak |last3=Hammer |first3=Leonard |title=Holy Places in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Confrontation and Co-existence |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nROPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24 |date=16 December 2009 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-26812-1 |pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
When the Greeks launched a [[Palm Sunday]] takeover of various [[Holy Land]] sites in 1757&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/sepulchre.shtml The Church of the Holy Sepulchre:A Work in Progress, by Raymond Cohen]&lt;/ref&gt; the Ottomans subsequently upheld this ''status quo''.&lt;ref&gt;Pat McCarthy, Seetheholyland.net, ''Church of St James, Jerusalem'' [http://www.seetheholyland.net/category/locations/injerusalem/page/2]&lt;/ref&gt;

This ''status quo'' for Jerusalem meant that certain statuses for the Holy Sites would be kept and were recognized as being permanent or at least the way things should be. The city was divided into four quarters. The [[Temple Mount]] became a [[Muslim]] holy place, and the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] as well as other various [[Christian]] sites were recognized as belonging to the Christian world. Despite the arguments over who would control what aspects of these sites, the status quo has remained largely intact from the 18th century to the present. Claims that this ''status quo'' was being violated led to the [[1929 Palestine riots]].

A further 1853 decree,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/sepulchre.shtml The Church of the Holy Sepulchre:A Work in Progress, by Raymond Cohen]&lt;/ref&gt; in the wake of the events leading to the [[Crimean War]], solidified the existing territorial division among the communities and set a ''status quo'' for arrangements to "remain forever", caused differences of opinion about upkeep and even minor changes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/sepulchre.shtml The Church of the Holy Sepulchre:A Work in Progress, by Raymond Cohen]&lt;/ref&gt; including disagreement on the removal of an exterior ladder under one of the windows; this ladder has remained in the same position since then.

==Impact==
Under the ''status quo'', no part of what is designated as common territory may be so much as rearranged without consent from all communities. This often leads to the neglect of badly needed repairs when the communities cannot come to an agreement among themselves about the final shape of a project. Just such a disagreement has delayed the renovations of most pilgrimage sites, and also where any change in the structure might result in a change to the ''status quo'', disagreeable to one or more of the communities. {{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''''The Giving Tree''''' is a children's [[picture book]] written and illustrated by [[Shel Silverstein]]. First published in 1964 by [[Harper &amp; Row]], it has become one of Silverstein's best known titles and has been translated into numerous languages.

This book has been described as "one of the most divisive books in children's literature." The controversy concerns whether the relationship between the main characters (a boy and a tree) should be interpreted as positive (i.e., the tree gives the boy [[Altruism|selfless love]]) or as negative (i.e., the boy and the tree have an abusive relationship).

==Background==

Silverstein had difficulty finding a publisher for ''The Giving Tree''.&lt;ref name=NYT1973&gt;{{cite news |title=About Alice, a Rabbit, a Tree... |author= Cole, William |newspaper=The New York Times |page=394|date=September 9, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2011&gt;{{cite news |title=The Children’s Authors Who Broke the Rules |author= Paul, Pamela|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/books/review/the-childrens-authors-who-broke-the-rules.html|newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 16, 2011 |accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editor at [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] rejected the book's manuscript because he felt that it was "too sad" for children and "too simple" for adults.&lt;ref name=NYT1973/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2011/&gt; [[Tomi Ungerer]] encouraged Silverstein to approach [[Ursula Nordstrom]], who was a publisher with Harper &amp; Row.&lt;ref name=NYT1973/&gt;

An editor with Harper &amp; Row stated that Silverstein had made the original illustrations "scratchy" like his cartoons for ''[[Playboy]]'', but that he later reworked the art in a "more pared-down and much sweeter style."&lt;ref name=HornBook1999/&gt; The final black-and-white drawings have been described as "unadorned… visual minimalism."&lt;ref name=Spitz1999&gt;{{cite book | last = Spitz | first = Ellen Handler | title = Inside Picture Books | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, CT | year = 1999 | isbn = 0300076029 | pages=142–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harper &amp; Row published a small first edition of the book, consisting of only 5,000–7,500 copies, in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Natov, Roni |author2=Geraldine DeLuca  |lastauthoramp=yes |year= 1979 |title= Discovering Contemporary Classics: an Interview with Ursula Nordstrom|journal= [[The Lion and the Unicorn (journal)|The Lion and the Unicorn]] |volume= 3 |issue= 1 |pages =119–135 |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/uni/summary/v003/3.1.natov01.html|access-date=May 18, 2013|doi= 10.1353/uni.0.0355 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The book follows the lives of a female apple tree and a boy, who develop a relationship with one another.  The tree is very "giving" and the boy evolves into a "taking" teenager, man, then elderly man.  Despite the fact that the boy ages in the story, the tree addresses the boy as "Boy" his entire life.  

In his childhood, the boy enjoys playing with the tree, climbing her trunk, swinging from her branches, carving "Me + T (Tree)" into the bark, and eating her apples. However, as the boy grows older, he spends less time with the tree and tends to visit her only when he wants material items at various stages of his life, or not coming to the tree alone (such as bringing a lady friend to the tree and carving "Me +Y.L." (her initials) into the tree. In an effort to make the boy happy at each of these stages, the tree gives him parts of herself, which he can transform into material items, such as money (from her apples), a house (from her branches), and a boat (from her trunk).  With every stage of giving, "the Tree was happy". 

In the final pages, both the tree and the boy feel the sting of their respective "giving" and "taking" nature.  When only a stump remains for the tree (including the carving "Me + T"), she is not happy, at least at that moment.  The boy does return as a tired elderly man to meet the tree once more. She tells him she is sad because she cannot provide him shade, apples, or any materials like in the past. He ignores this and states that all he wants is "a quiet place to sit and rest," which the tree, who is weak being just a stump, could provide.  With this final stage of giving, "the Tree was happy".

==Reception==

Interest in the book increased by [[word of mouth]]; for example, in churches "it was hailed as a parable on the joys of giving."&lt;ref name=NYT1973/&gt;  As of 2001, over 5 million copies of the book had been sold, placing it 14th on a list of hardcover "All-Time Bestselling Children's Books" from ''[[Publishers Weekly]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Roback, Diane, Jason Britton, and Debbie Hochman Turvey |date= December 17, 2001 |title= All-Time Bestselling Children's Books |journal= Publishers Weekly |volume= 248 |issue= 51 |url= http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20011217/28595-all-time-bestselling-children-s-books.html|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2011, 8.5 million copies of the book had been sold.&lt;ref name=NYT2011/&gt;

== Interpretations ==
{{weasel words|section|date=April 2015}}
The book has generated various opinions on how to interpret the relationship between the tree and the boy.  Some possible interpretations include:&lt;ref name=Samuelsson1998&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pramling Samuelsson|first1=Ingrid |last2=Mauritzson|first2=Ulla|last3=Asplund Carlsson|first3=Maj|last4=Ueda|first4=Miyoko|title=A Mother and a Friend: Differences in Japanese and Swedish Mothers' Understanding of a Tale|journal=Childhood|volume=5|issue=4|year=1998|pages=493–506|issn=0907-5682|doi=10.1177/0907568298005004008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fraustino2008&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fraustino |first1=Lisa Rowe |chapter=At the Core of The Giving Tree’s Signifying Apples |pages=284–306  | editor1-first=Annette M.  |editor1-last=Magid | title = You Are What You Eat: Literary Probes into the Palate | publisher = Cambridge Scholars | location = Newcastle, UK | year = 2008 | isbn = 9781847184924 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious interpretation===
Ursula Nordstrom attributed the book's success partially to "Protestant ministers and Sunday-school teachers", who believed that the tree represents "the Christian ideal of unconditional love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/books/review/15MARCUSL.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title='Runny Babbit': Hoppity Hip |first=Leonard S. |last=Marcus|date=May 15, 2005|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental interpretation===
Some people believe that the tree represents [[Mother Nature]] and the boy represents humanity. The book has been used to teach children [[environmental ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Examined Life, Age 8 |author= Goodnough, Abby |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/education/edlife/18philosophy-t.html  |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 16, 2010|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An educational resource for children describes the book as an "allegory about the responsibilities a human being has for living organisms in the environment,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fredericks | first = Anthony D. | title = The Librarian's Complete Guide to Involving Parents Through Children's Literature Grades K-6 | publisher = Libraries Unlimited | location = Englewood, CO | year = 1997 | isbn = 1563085380 |chapter= 26. The Giving Tree | page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Rowe Fraustino states that “some curricula use the book as a what-not-to-do role model."&lt;ref name=Fraustino2008/&gt; 

===Friendship interpretation===
One writer believes that the relationship between the boy and the tree is one of friendship.  As such, the book teaches children "as your life becomes polluted with the trappings of the modern world — as you 'grow up' — your relationships tend to suffer if you let them fall to the wayside."&lt;ref name=Belkin2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/childrens-books-you-might-hate/|publisher=New York Times|title=Children’s Books You (Might) Hate|author=Belkin, Lisa|work="Motherlode: Adventures in Parenting" blog|date=September 8, 2010|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer's criticism of this interpretation is that the tree appears to be an adult when the boy is young, and cross-generational friendships are rare.&lt;ref name=Belkin2010/&gt;

===Parent–child interpretations===
A common interpretation of the book is that the tree and the boy have a parent–child relationship, as in a 1995 collection of essays about the book edited by [[Richard John Neuhaus]] in the journal ''[[First Things]]''.&lt;ref name=FirstThings&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/08/002-the-giving-tree-a-symposium-43|author=May, William F., Amy A. Kass, Marc Gellman, Midge Decter, Gilbert Meilaender, Mary Ann Glendon, William Werpehowski, Timothy Fuller, Leon R. Kass, Timothy P. Jackson, Jean Bethke Elshtain, Richard John Neuhaus|title=The Giving Tree: A Symposium|date=January 1995|publisher=The Institute on Religion and Public Life|journal=[[First Things]]|accessdate=May 18, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512035637/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/08/002-the-giving-tree-a-symposium-43|archivedate=May 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the essayists, some were positive about the relationship; for example, [[Amy A. Kass]] wrote about the story that "it is wise and it is true about giving and about motherhood," and her husband [[Leon Kass|Leon R. Kass]] encourages people to read the book because the tree "is an emblem of the sacred memory of our own mother's love."&lt;ref name=FirstThings/&gt; Other essayists put forth negative views. [[Mary Ann Glendon]] wrote that the book is "a nursery tale for the 'me' generation, a primer of narcissism, a catechism of exploitation," and [[Jean Bethke Elshtain]] felt that the story ends with the tree and the boy "both wrecks."&lt;ref name=FirstThings/&gt;

A 1998 study using [[Phenomenography|phenomenographic]] methods found that Swedish children and mothers tended to interpret the book as dealing with friendship, while Japanese mothers tended to interpret the book as dealing with parent–child relationships.&lt;ref name=Samuelsson1998/&gt;

===Interpretation as satire===
Some authors believe that the book is not actually intended for children, but instead should be treated as a [[satire]] aimed at adults along the lines of ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]].&lt;ref name=JacksonDell&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jackson, Jacqueline |author2=Carol Dell  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1979 |title= The Other Giving Tree|journal=Language Arts |volume=56 |issue= 4|pages= 427–429|jstor=41404822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StrandburgLivo1986&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Strandburg, Walter L. |author2=Norma J. Livo |lastauthoramp=yes |title=''The Giving Tree'' or There is a Sucker Born Every Minute|journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=17|issue=1|year=1986|pages=17–24|doi=10.1007/BF01126946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and controversy ==

Elizabeth Bird, writing for the ''School Library Journal'', described ''The Giving Tree'' as "one of the most divisive books in children's literature".&lt;ref name=SLJ2012&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.slj.com/afuse8production/2012/05/18/top-100-picture-books-85-the-giving-tree-by-shel-silverstein/|title= Top 100 Picture Books #85: The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein|author= Bird, Elizabeth | publisher=''[[School Library Journal]]'' "A Fuse #8 Production" blog|date= May 18, 2012|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism revolves about the depiction of the relationship between the boy and the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Spitz, Ellen Handler|date=May–June 1999 |title= Classic children's book|journal=American Heritage |volume=50 |issue= 3|pages= 46|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/classic-children%E2%80%99s-book|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote |Totally self-effacing, the 'mother' treats her 'son' as if he were a perpetual infant, while he behaves toward her as if he were frozen in time as an importunate baby. This overrated picture book thus presents as a paradigm for young children a callously exploitative human relationship — both across genders and across generations. It perpetuates the myth of the selfless, all-giving mother who exists only to be used and the image of a male child who can offer no reciprocity, express no gratitude, feel no empathy — an insatiable creature who encounters no limits for his demands.}}

Critics of the book say that the boy never thanks the tree for its gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Lesson from 'The Giving Tree'  |author= Prosapio, Winter |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0512/p18s03-hfes.html |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=May 12, 2006  |accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''Horn Book Magazine'', Phyllis J.

One college instructor discovered that the book caused both male and female [[Remedial education|remedial reading]] students to be angry because they felt that the boy exploited the tree.&lt;ref name=Juchartz2004&gt;{{cite journal |author= Juchartz, Larry R|date=December 2003 – January 2004 |title= Team Teaching with Dr. Seuss and Shel Silverstein in the College Basic Reading Classroom|journal= Journal of Adolescent &amp; Adult Literacy |volume= 47|issue=4 |pages=336–341}}&lt;/ref&gt; For teaching purposes, he paired the book with a short story by [[Andre Dubus]] entitled "The Fat Girl" because its plot can be described as ''The Giving Tree'' "in reverse."&lt;ref name=Juchartz2004/&gt;

=== Author's photograph ===
[[File:Shel Silverstein photograph on back cover of The Giving Tree.jpeg|thumb|Photograph of Silverstein that is used on the back cover of the book.]]

==Cultural influences and adaptations==

===Other versions===

A short animated film of the book, produced in 1973, featured Silverstein's narration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= Bosustow, Nick, and Shel Silverstein (Producers); Hayward, Charlie O.

Silverstein also wrote a song of the same name, which was performed by [[Bobby Bare]] and his family on his album ''Singin' in the Kitchen'' (1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= Bobby Bare and the Family (Musicians); Silverstein, Shel (Principal Composer) |year= 1973|title=Singin' in the Kitchen|medium=LP |publisher=RCA Victor|location=New York|oclc= 6346534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silverstein created an adult version of the story in a cartoon entitled "I Accept the Challenge."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the cartoon, a nude woman cuts off a nude man's arms and legs with scissors, then sits on his torso in a pose similar to the final drawing in ''The Giving Tree'' in which the old man sits on the stump.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Jackson and Dell (1979) wrote an "alternative version" of the story for teaching purposes that was entitled "The Other Giving Tree."&lt;ref name=JacksonDell/&gt; It featured two trees next to each other and a boy growing up.  One tree acted like the one in ''The Giving Tree'', ending up as a stump, while the other tree stopped at giving the boy apples, and does not give the boy its branches or trunk. At the end of the story, the stump was sad that the old man chose to sit under the shade of the other tree.&lt;ref name=JacksonDell/&gt;

===Cultural influences===

[[The Giving Tree Band]] took its name from the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Giving Tree Band Takes Story to Heart |author= Markstrom, Serena |url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Giving+Tree+Band+takes+story+to+heart.-a0230805426|newspaper=[[The Register-Guard]] |date=June 18, 2010|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plain White T's EP ''[[Should've Gone to Bed]]'' has a song The Giving Tree, written by [[Tim Lopez]].

A '''trailer park''' is a temporary  or permanent area for [[mobile home]]s and [[travel trailer]]s. Advantages include low cost compared to other housing, and quick and easy moving to a new area, for example when taking a job in a distant place while keeping the same home.

Trailer parks, especially in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], are stereotypically viewed as [[Affordable housing|lower income housing]] for occupants living at or below the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]] who have low social status and lead a desultory and deleterious lifestyle. Despite the advances in trailer home technology, the trailer park image survives as evoked by a statement from Presidential adviser [[James Carville]] who, in the course of one of the [[Bill Clinton]] [[White House]] political scandals, suggested "Drag $100 bills through trailer parks, there's no telling what you'll find," in reference to [[Paula Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Will she have her day in court?

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also seen in the Canadian [[mockumentary]] ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]''.

[[Tornado]]es and [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]s often inflict serious damage on trailer parks, usually because the structures are not secured to the ground and their construction is significantly less able to withstand high wind forces than regular houses. However, most modern [[Manufactured housing|manufactured homes]] are built to withstand high winds, using hurricane straps and proper foundations.

=== In the United States ===
{{further|RV park}}
The negative perception of trailer parks was not improved by the creation of emergency trailer parks by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) for the displaced victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]], the quality and temporary nature of which was disputed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/12/us/nationalspecial/12exile.html ''Road to New Life After Katrina Is Closed to Many''], [[New York Times]], July 12, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many stereotypes have developed regarding people who live in trailer parks, which are similar to [[stereotype]]s of the poor and the term ''[[trailer trash]]'' is often used as an adjective in the same vein as the derogatory American terms ''[[white trash]]'' or ''[[ghetto]]''. Though trailer parks appear throughout the United States, they are often associated with the [[Deep South]] and rural areas.

More recently referred to in the U.S. as "mobile home parks" or "[[manufactured housing]] communities", the stereotypes are often just that. [[Age-Restricted communities]] exist in many locales that permit mobile home parks as "55+ parks" in keeping with the [[Housing for Older Persons Act]] (HOPA). Generally at least one homeowner in these age-restricted communities must be age 55 or over and persons under the age of 18 are rarely permitted to live there. These can be [[gated community|gated communities]] with amenities such as [[swimming pool]]s, [[community center|clubhouse]]s and on-site maintenance. Homes are often permanently installed on foundations. However, in certain circumstances residents may not own the land their homes occupy.

=== Outside United States ===
In [[Europe]], particularly in [[Germany]] and [[Spain]], where trailer parks are less common (but exist) as 'normal' accommodation, disputed trailer parks exist that [[squatting|squat]] on land near urban centers (Berlin, Hamburg, Barcelona). Names for such phenomena include ''Wagenburg'', ''Wagendorf'' or ''Bauwagenplatz'' (all German, meaning: "wagon fort", "trailer village" and "construction trailer place" respectively) and people living there are often associated with certain ethnic groups such as [[Romani people|Romani]], or with the punk movement, [[New age travelers]], [[Irish travelers]] and a [[DIY punk ethic|''do-it-yourself punk ethic'']]. On the whole, however, trailer parks are much less common in these countries than they are elsewhere and in [[United States]] and are much less emblematic of a distinct lifestyle and membership to a certain social class.

In Germany, the Netherlands and some other European countries local law allows for normal camping at [[RV park]]s for a short time and seasonal camping for holiday makers, and also long-time camping (for years) with hardly movable travel trailers. Sometimes the inhabitants also cultivate a [[Allotment (gardening)#United Kingdom|garden]]. Some cities allow a long-time camping lot to be the regular address registered with the authorities; others do not. Many of mobile home plots are offered by [[RV park]]s that allow for all sorts of camping and offer extra plots for mobile homes (static caravans).The cost for such a plot tends to be between 400 € and 1.500 € a year, depending on the location and facilities.

In France, living in a trailer or mobile home for more than three months is prohibited by law, even if the resident owns the land; however, building requirements and permissions for self building of recreational solid (static) country cottages are more relaxed in France if one stays within a certain amount of square meters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In the United Kingdom, "trailers" are commonly known as static caravans, and are generally used for one of two purposes:  firstly as holiday homes, designed for short-term living; and secondly as retirement homes for the elderly, designed for long-term occupancy. Both types of trailers usually enjoy good amenities and are surrounded by highly manicured gardens.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In [[Australia]], there is generally no differentiation between a trailer park and an [[RV park]]. The term "caravan park" is used to refer to both.

In New Zealand, the suburb of [[Favona]] in [[Auckland]] is an area where trailer parks are concentrated.

'''William Raymond Manchester''' (April 1, 1922 – June 1, 2004)&lt;ref name=TimesObit&gt;{{cite news |last1=Severo |first1=Richard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/02/arts/william-manchester-whose-biographies-detailed-power-20th-century-dies-82.html |title=William Manchester, Whose Biographies Detailed Power in the 20th Century, Dies at 82 |date=June 2, 2004 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American author, biographer, and historian. He was the author of 18 books which have been translated into over 20 languages.&lt;ref&gt;According to one writer, "Scholars generally disliked the biographies by Manchester. They were deemed superficial, anecdotal, hyperbolic, and hagiographic." Eugene L. Rasor, ''Winston S. Churchill, 1874–1965: A Comprehensive Historiography and Annotated Bibliography.'' Greenwood Press. 2000, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[National Humanities Medal]] and the [[Abraham Lincoln Literary Award]].

==Early life==
Manchester was born in [[Attleboro, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1463459/William-Manchester.html |title=William Manchester [Obituary] |date=June 3, 2004 |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=TimesObit /&gt; His father served in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] during [[World War I]]. After his father's death, and the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]], William Manchester likewise enlisted in the Marine Corps. However, he was ordered back to college until called up. Initially he joined the Officer Candidate School but was dropped before receiving a commission. After being warranted to the rank of corporal, he was sent to Guadalcanal in 1944 for further training. Although he had expected to serve in Europe, Manchester ultimately found himself in the Pacific Theater. He served in the Pacific War's final campaign on [[Battle of Okinawa|the island of Okinawa]], was severely wounded on June 5, 1945, and was promoted to sergeant&lt;ref&gt;Letters to his mother, July 1945, UMASS archives.&lt;/ref&gt; in July and awarded the [[Purple Heart]]. Manchester's wartime experiences formed the basis for his very personal account of the [[War in the Pacific|Pacific Theater]], ''[[Goodbye, Darkness: A Memoir of the Pacific War]]''. In this memoir, Manchester uses personal anecdotes from his service on Okinawa in his descriptions of battles on [[Guadalcanal]], [[Tarawa]] and [[Saipan]]. He stated this in the end notes, as well as clearly denying any attempt at a chronological account. Manchester's portrayal of his [[Section (military unit)#United States Marine Corps|section]] in combat on Guadalcanal is a literary device.

Manchester also wrote of [[World War II]] in several other books, including the first and second volumes and, according to a December 2012 C-SPAN interview with his co-author Paul Reid, a small portion of the third volume of the three-part biography, [[The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill|''The Last Lion'']], of [[Winston Churchill]]. Manchester also wrote a biography of General [[Douglas MacArthur]], ''[[American Caesar]]''.

Manchester worked as a copyboy for the ''[[Daily Oklahoman]]'' in 1945 before returning to college. In 1946, he completed his B.A. from the [[Massachusetts State College]], and in 1947 he earned his master's degree from the [[University of Missouri]].

Manchester married Julia Brown Marshall on March 27, 1948, and they had one son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.granitesign.com/about-fox-becker.html |title=William Manchester |publisher=Nndb.com |date=March 27, 1948 |accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporter and professor==
In 1947, Manchester went to work as a reporter for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''. There he met journalist [[H. L. Mencken]], who became his friend and mentor,&lt;ref name=filkins/&gt; and also became the subject of Manchester's master's thesis and first book, ''Disturber of the Peace''. The biography, published in 1951, profiles Mencken, the self-described "conservative anarchist" who made his mark as a writer, editor, and political pundit in the 1920s. In 1953, Manchester published his novel ''The City of Anger'', set in [[Baltimore]] and dealing with inner city life and the [[numbers game|numbers racket]], subjects Manchester had learned about as a big city reporter.

In 1955, Manchester became an editor for [[Wesleyan University]] and the [[Wesleyan University Press]] and spent the rest of his career at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seidel |first=Rebecca |url=http://wesleyanargus.com/2010/01/29/university-to-unveil-william-manchester-writings-amid-return-of-jfk-manuscript/ |title=University To Unveil William Manchester Writings Amid Return of JFK Manuscript – Features |publisher=The Wesleyan Argus |date= |accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the academic year 1959–1960, he was a Fellow on the faculty at the Center for Advanced Studies of Wesleyan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/ce1000-137.html |title=Guide to the Center for Advanced Studies Records, 1958 – 1969 |publisher=Wesleyan.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314083709/http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/ce1000-137.html |archivedate=March 14, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later became an [[adjunct professor]] of history, adjunct professor emeritus, and writer-in-residence at the university.  During his association with Wesleyan University, Manchester developed an intense writing regimen that he adhered to for much of his life, often writing nonstop for up to 50 hours at a time.  He described the experience as follows:  "I would work all day, all night, all the next day, all the following night and into the third day.  I would look up at the clock, and it would be 3:30 in the afternoon, and I would say, 'Oh boy, I've got three more hours to write.'  I just loved it."&lt;ref name=filkins/&gt;

==JFK assassination==
His best-selling book, ''[[The Death of a President]]'' (1967), is a detailed account of the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]], who had been the subject of an earlier book by Manchester. In 1964, Manchester was commissioned by the Kennedy family to write the book.&lt;ref&gt;'Sam Kashner [http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/10/death-of-a-president200910?currentPage=all "A Clash of Camelots"], ''Vanity Fair'', October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester, who retraced the movements of President Kennedy and [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] before the assassination, concluded, based on his study of Oswald's psychology and their similar training as Marine sharpshooters, that Oswald had acted alone. Manchester had the support of [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]] and [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]], but later had a falling-out with Robert over Manchester's treatment of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

Before the book could be published, Jacqueline Kennedy filed a lawsuit to prevent its publication, even though she had previously authorized it. The suit was settled in 1967, reportedly with Manchester's agreeing to drop certain passages dealing with details of Kennedy's family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Krassner |first1=Paul |url=http://www.nypress.com/16/34/news&amp;columns/feature.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040208104724/http://www.nypress.com/16/34/news%26columns/feature.cfm |title=Slaughtering Cows and Popping Cherries |volume=16 |issue=34 |archivedate=February 8, 2004 |newspaper=[[New York Press]] |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Nobile]], (November 17, 2013). "JFK, Jackie Joined the Mile High-Club Day Before His Death". [[The New York Post]].&lt;/ref&gt; In response [[Satire|satirist]] [[Paul Krassner]] published a piece entitled "[[The Parts That Were Left Out of the Kennedy Book]]", which imagined scandalous censored material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ep.tc/realist/74/ |title=The Parts That Were Left Out of the Kennedy Book |author=Paul Krassner |issue=74 |date=May 1967|publisher=[[The Realist]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his collection of essays ''Controversy'' (1977), Manchester detailed Kennedy's attempts to suppress the book. The book was a best-seller at release, but was allowed to go out of print until 1988.  It was re-issued in October 2013.&lt;ref name="reissue"&gt;[[Associated Press]]. "[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/controversial-jfk-book-reissued-october-121506575.html;_ylt=A2KLOzG4kT9SwzAAF8TwFAx.  Controversial JFK book to be reissued in October]" ''Yahoo! Finance'', September 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In 2001, President [[George W. Bush]] presented Manchester with the [[National Humanities Medal]]. Manchester was also the recipient of the Abraham Lincoln Literary Award, among other awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/news/archive/20020314.html |title=News Archive &amp;#124; National Endowment for the Humanities |publisher=Neh.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of his wife in 1998, Manchester suffered two strokes. He announced that he would not be able to complete his planned third volume of his three part-biography of Churchill, ''[[The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill: Defender of the Realm, 1940-1965]]''.  He was initially reluctant to collaborate with anyone to finish to work,&lt;ref name=filkins&gt;{{cite news |last1=Filkins |first1=Dexter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/14/arts/14MANC.html |title=Ailing Churchill biographer says he can't finish trilogy |publisher=New York Times |date=August 14, 2001 |accessdate=2014-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in October 2003, he asked Paul Reid, a friend and writer for ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'', to complete the Churchill biography.

Manchester died at the age of 82 on June 1, 2004.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost_Bernstein_20040604&gt;{{cite news

*In 2010, [[Nissan]] has developed a [[GPS]]-enabled warning system to alert drivers travelling in the wrong direction on motorways. The first application is the [[Nissan Fuga]] hybrid luxury sedan. The system, uses GPS positioning data, map data and vehicle speed data to determine if the vehicle is travelling against the flow of traffic.  The system identifies an area for determining the normal direction of flow, such as around junctions. When the vehicle passes through that area, the system records its direction of travel. If the vehicle enters that area again and the system determines that it’s driving in the opposite direction it provides audible and visual warnings.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The '''École nationale des chartes''' is a French ''[[grande école]]'' and a constituent college of [[PSL Research University]] specialised in historical sciences. It was founded in 1821 and was located first at the National Archives, then at the Palais de la Sorbonne (5th arrondissement). In October 2014, it moved to 65 rue de Richelieu (University of Paris II), opposite to the Richelieu-Louvois Site of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|National Library of France]]. The school is administered by the [[Ministère de l'enseignement supérieur et de la recherche|Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research]]. It holds the status of ''grand établissement''. Its students, who are recruited by competitive examination and hold the status of trainee civil servant, receive the qualification of archivist-paleographer after completing a thesis. They generally go on to follow a career as heritage curators in the archive and visual fields, as library curators or as lecturers and researchers in the human and social sciences. In 2005, the school also introduced [[Master degree|Master’s degrees]], for which students were recruited based on an application file, and, in 2011, [[doctorates]].

==History==

The École des chartes was created by order of [[Louis XVIII]] on 22 February 1821,&lt;ref&gt;Royal Decree of 22 February 1821 establishing a School of Charts, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, p. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; although its roots are in the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] and the Napoleonic period. The Revolution, during which property was confiscated, congregations were suppressed and competencies were transferred from the Church to the State, produced radical cultural changes. In 1793 the feudist Antoine Maugard approached the public instruction committee of the Convention with a proposal for a project of historical and diplomatic education. The project was never carried out, and Maugard was largely forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Project revived in 1891 by Gustave Servois, general guard of the National Archives:  "Projet d'un enseignement historique et diplomatique à la Bibliothèque nationale sous la Convention", ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1891, volume 52, p. 353-355.&lt;/ref&gt; The institution was finally created by the philologist and anthropologist [[Joseph Marie de Gérando]], baron of the Empire and general secretary to Champagny, the Minister of the Interior. In 1807 he submitted a proposal to [[Napoleon]] for the creation of a school to train young scholars of history.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from the Baron of Gérando to Mr. Marial Delpit, 6 April 1839, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, p. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon examined the proposal and declared that he wished to develop a much larger specialist history school.&lt;ref&gt;Auguste Vallet de Viriville, "Notes et documents pouvant servir à l'histoire de l'école royale des chartes. Recherches sur le projet présenté à l'Empereur en 1807, par le baron de Gérando", in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1848, volume 9, p. 153-176.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gérando was posted to Italy on an administrative mission, and the project was interrupted. At the end of 1820, Gérando convinced [[Joseph Jérôme, Comte Siméon|Count Siméon]], a philosopher and professor of law who had been state councilor under the Empire and who was at that time Minister of the Interior, of the usefulness of an institution modeled on the ''[[grandes écoles]]'', dedicated to the study of “a branch of French literature”,&lt;ref&gt;"Rapport adressé au roi Louis XVIII le 22 February 1821 par M. le comte Siméon, ministre de l'Intérieur", in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; the charters. The 1820s were a favorable period for the creation of the École des chartes. This was firstly because the atmosphere of nostalgia for the Middle Ages created a desire to train specialists who would, by carrying out a direct study of archives and manuscripts confiscated during the Revolution, be able to renew French historiography. Secondly, the need was also felt to maintain this branch of study, which stemmed from Maurist tradition, since the field was endangered by a lack of knowledgeable collaborators in the “science of charters and manuscripts”. And thirdly, during the reign of Louis XVIII, a period which saw the return of the Ultras and during which the constitutional monarchy was called into question, the political context influenced the creation of an institution whose name inevitably made explicit reference to the defense of the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;Lara Jennifer Moore, Restoring order. "The École des Chartes and the Organization of Archives and Libraries in France, 1820-1870", Duluth (Minn.), Litwin Books, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the order of 1821, twelve students were nominated by the Minister of the Interior, based on propositions by the ''Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-lettres''[[&lt;ref&gt;Royal decree of 22 February 1821, article 2, in the library of Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes, 1839-1840, volume 1, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;]], and they were paid&lt;ref&gt;Royal decree of 22 February 1821, article 1, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, op.cit&lt;/ref&gt; during the two years of their studies. They principally studied [[paleography]] and [[philology]], with a purely practical aim: to be able to read and understand the documents that they would be responsible for curating.&lt;ref&gt;Royal decree of 22 February 1821, article 3, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; The professors and students of the school were placed under the authority of the curator of medieval manuscripts of the Royal Library, rue de Richelieu, and of the general guard of the Archives of the Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Royal decree of 22 February 1821, article 5, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

This first experience was not very successful, mainly because no job openings were reserved for the students. The first course was implemented in two stages by the ministerial decree of 11 May (for the Royal Library course) and by the decree of 21 December 1821 (for the Archives of the Kingdom course), and was the only one run. The ''Académie'' did put forward a new list of candidates,&lt;ref&gt;L’École, son histoire, son œuvre. Livre du centenaire, Paris, Auguste Picard, 1921, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and the course length was set at two years&lt;ref&gt;Royal decree of 16 July 1823, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, p. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt; by the Order of 16 July 1823, but lessons had to be suspended on 19 December 1823 due to a lack of students. However, following a long period of inactivity, the Ministry of the Interior decided to re-open the school. Rives, the director of staff of the ministry, together with [[Dacier]], drew up a report on the reorganization of the School and a draft order,&lt;ref&gt;Martial Delpit, Notice historique sur l'École royale des Chartes, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes''. 1839-1840, volume 1. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; proposed to [[Charles X]] by [[La Bourdonnaye]], which resulted in the order of 11 November 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Royal decree of 11 November 1829 containing the reorganization of the École des chartes, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, p. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt; The school was now open to anyone who had acquired the Baccalaureate, but six to eight students were selected by competitive examination at the end of the first year. They received a salary and followed two further years of training. On completion of their studies, they received the qualification of archivist-paleographer and were reserved half of the available jobs in libraries and archives. The first valedictorian was [[Alexandre Teulet]].

The "[[Guizot]] period" benefited the École des chartes, which soon became an important institution in the field of historical – particularly medieval – studies. On 24 March 1839 the Société de l’École des chartes&lt;ref&gt;Chronique et Mélanges, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes''. 1889, volume 50. p. 278-289&lt;/ref&gt; was founded by Louis Douët d’Arcq, among others, and it published the Bibliothèque de l’École des Chartes, one of the oldest French scientific reviews, to disseminate the work carried out in the school. The Order of 31 December 1846&lt;ref&gt;Royal decree of 31 décembre 1846, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1847, volume 8, p. 170-173&lt;/ref&gt; implemented a fundamental reorganization of the school and its study program, which then remained unchanged for more than a century. The students, who were holders of the Baccalaureate, were recruited by examination (which shortly afterwards became a competitive examination), and followed a three-year course of studies. Interdisciplinarity, an essential characteristic of the school, was then written into the reform, which required students to study six subjects, some of which were not taught anywhere else. The second innovation, a thesis, was introduced, with the first public defense being held in 1849. A surveillance council was set up, consisting of the guard of the Archives, the director of the Royal Library, the director of the School and five members of the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-lettres]]. The school was finally provided with a new statute. It moved to the Kingdom Archives in the [[hôtel de Soubise]], in the oval hall and adjacent rooms of the hôtel de Clisson.

[[File:Eleves Ecole des chartes 1857.jpg|thumb|left|The students of 1857]]

By now, the École des chartes had become a point of reference in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frédéricq, ''L'enseignement supérieur de l'histoire à Paris, notes et impressions de voyage'' in ''Revue internationale de l'enseignement'', 2e semestre 1883,p. 746-752 [archive] : "The École des chartes to me appeared to be an institution without equal. Together with the École pratique des hautes Études, it offers the most solid, most complete, most truly scientific historical education in Paris. Other countries envy France its already venerable École des chartes. Germany, so well equipped with history and auxiliary science universities, as yet has no counterpart to my knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Its historical research methodology had been greatly modernized, as had its teaching methods, thanks to the copies of ancient documents to which it had access. The students were taught paleography, sigillography, numismatics, philology, filing for archives and libraries, historical geography, currencies, systems of weights and measures, the history of political institutions in France, archeology, civil law, canonic law and feudal law. The teaching had both a scientific and a professional aim.

Thus, by gradually integrating into the network of royal then national and departmental archive services, the graduates of the school contributed to the densification of the network and to the improvement of archivist principles. A pathway for the graduates was thus established in the archives, first implemented by the Order of 31 December 1846, then reinforced by a legislative framework providing them with a means to enforce this law. The decree of 4 February 1850 reserved the posts of departmental archivist to those holding the qualification of archivist-paleographer,&lt;ref&gt;See Vincent Mollet, 'La conquête des archives départementales', dans ''École nationale des chartes. Histoire de l’École depuis 1821'', [[Yves-Marie Bercé]], [[Olivier Guyotjeannin]], [[Marc Smith (palaeographer)|Marc Smith]] (dir.), Thionville, Gérard Klopp, 1997, p. 253-262.&lt;/ref&gt; while all the job posts at the National Archives (except the position of senior civil servant) were reserved for them by the decree of 14 May 1887. The same could not be said of libraries. The order of 1839&lt;ref&gt;Order of 29 February 1939, articles 15 et 26 relating to the École des chartes, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1839-1840, volume 1, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  was never applied, and although the order of 1839 reserved places at the Royal Library for École des chartes graduates, fewer than 7% of them worked in a library in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Henri-Jean Martin, « Les chartistes et les bibliothèques », Bulletin des bibliothèques de France, 1972, no 12,p. 529-537 [archive] : In 1867, of 222 alumni of the École des chartes, only 15 found employment as librarians, 13 of them in Paris and two elsewhere in France.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the end of the Second Empire, partly thanks to the work of [[Léopold Delisle]], the general administrator of the national library, that the qualifications of the school’s graduates were recognized by libraries.&lt;ref&gt;See Louis Desgraves, Quelques éminents bibliothécaires : galerie, in ''École nationale des chartes. Histoire de l’École depuis 1821'', op. cit., p. 263-267.&lt;/ref&gt; Little by little, decrees and orders facilitated their access to jobs in libraries.

The school moved in 1866 into more suitable premises in the hôtel de Breteuil, rue des Francs-Bourgeois, without this move having much effect on the teaching. Seven professorships were instituted by the decree of 30 January 1869: paelography; Latin languages; bibliography; filing for libraries and archives; diplomacy; political, administrative and judiciary institutions in France; civil and canonic law of the Middle Ages and archeology of the Middle Ages. Apart from minor modifications, these remained unchanged until 1955. The school moved once again in 1897, to 19 rue de la Sorbonne, into the premises originally intended for the Paris Faculté de théologie catholique. This move brought the school geographically closer to the other research and teaching institutions based at the Sorbonne, such as the Faculté de lettres and the École pratique des hautes études. The school had a classroom, with windows along both sides and special deep desks for paleography practice, as well as a library, in which books were available for immediate access.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Hottin, Le 19, rue de la Sorbonne, l’École ses bâtiments, sa décoration, dans ''L’École nationale des chartes. Histoire de l’École depuis 1821'', op. cit., p. 142-148. Text available on HAL-SHS (notice halshs-00087473 [archive])&lt;/ref&gt; Although the premises have been refurbished, the school is still located here today. During the 1920s, a number of moves to other premises were proposed,&lt;ref&gt;Christian Hottin, ''L’École des chartes : institutionnalité et architecture''. Text available on HAL-SHS (notice halshs-00089095 [archive])&lt;/ref&gt; with suggestions including the [[hôtel de Rohan]] in 1924, the garden of the Institution for Deaf-Mutes (suggested by Michel Roux-Spitz), a plot on rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, a house on rue de Vaugirard, the former Polytechnic School, and the refectory of the Bernardins. The school will move in 2015 to the Richelieu area, into new premises at 65 rue de Richelieu and 12 rue des Petits-Champs. The school was also a founding member of the Campus Condorcet,&lt;ref&gt;Decree no. 2012-286 of 28 February 2012 establishing Campus Condorcet, a public institution of scientific cooperation [archive].&lt;/ref&gt; and for this reason, some of its research activities were conducted at the Aubervilliers campus.

The image of the École des chartes, in political and social terms, was firmly anchored, even though it has sometimes been classified as a right-wing institution.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Dumoulin, « Histoire et historiens de droite », in Jean-François Sirinelli (dir.), ''Histoire des droites en France'', volume 2, « Cultures », Éditions Gallimard, collection « Tel », 2006,p. 361-362&lt;/ref&gt; The image of the "right-wing chartiste" originated in the figure of the "amateur", the son of a well-off family, passing through the school to kill time elegantly, or to "wait", in the words of Robert Martin du Gard,&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Joly, 'Les chartistes et la politique', dans ''L’École nationale des chartes. Histoire de l’École depuis 1821'', op. cit.,p. 169-178&lt;/ref&gt; who graduated from the school in 1905. In fact, throughout the 19th century there was a discontinuity between the high-prestige training offered by the École des chartes and the lower-prestige, modestly remunerated jobs open to graduates. However, this reputation was at least partly unfounded, as demonstrated by several cases. At the time of the [[Dreyfus Affair]],&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Joly, 'L'École des chartes et l'Affaire Dreyfus', in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes''. 1989, volume 147.p. 611-671 [archive].&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the milieu of the École des chartes mirrored the divisions in French society: “Nowhere were civic quarrels more completely invested in the job of historian”.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Rebérioux, 'Histoire, historiens et dreyfusisme', in ''Revue historique'', t. 255, 1976, p. 407-432, à la p. 425. Cited by Bertrand Joly, L'École des chartes et l'Affaire Dreyfus, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  The few chartistes who were called upon as experts during the Zola process – [[Arthur Giry]], [[Auguste Molinier]], [[Paul Meyer (philologist)|Paul Meyer]], [[Paul Viollet]] and [[Gaston Paris]] – and who were involved in the founding of the League of Human Rights were attacked by other archivist-paleographers, including Robert de Lasteyrie, [[Gabriel Hanotaux]] and Émile Couard, as well as by their students at the École des chartes. The variety of engagements at the time of the Dreyfus Affair did not necessarily reflect the political sensitivities of those involved, and their motives were political as well as professional, jeopardizing the very training and methods of the school.&lt;ref&gt;See Laurent Ferri. 'Émile Zola et « ces messieurs de l’École des chartes »' in the Dreyfus Affair : unpublished, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes''. 2006, volume 164, livraison 2. p. 595-603 [archive].&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was conservative to some extent, the school admitted a female student, Geneviève Acloque, in 1906, long before the other ''grandes écoles'' had started admitting women. The École des chartes may have been perceived as a bastion of the French Action during the interwar period, although several relatively prominent alumni, such as Georges Bataille or Roger Martin du Gard, seem to have been more left-leaning. During the Second World War, there were therefore more École des chartes students and teachers on the side of the Resistance than on the side of Vichy. Bertrand Joly concludes that the school was largely neutral, in that each “wing” seems to have been equally represented, a neutrality that was also justified by the fact that the school was not big enough for its members to have a significant effect on national politics.

The entrance examination and internal examinations of the École des chartes were reformed at the beginning of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Decrees of 19 June 1931, 16 March 1931 and 5 October 1932&lt;/ref&gt; At this time,&lt;ref&gt;Decree of 22 February 1932 ; decrees of 29 April 1933 and 29 November 1933&lt;/ref&gt; the school began offering the qualification of diplôme technique de bibliothécaire (DTB) 34, which was required to obtain a job as a librarian in first-category municipal libraries or [[university libraries]]. The school opened its classes on the history of books and bibliography to external students preparing for the qualification. This practice continued until 1950, when the ''diplôme supérieur de bibliothécaire'' (DSB) replaced the DTB as the qualification for librarians.

The mid-20th century was a difficult period for the school as it struggled to modernize. Its student numbers dropped sharply (there were only 11 archivist-paleographers in the class of 1959&lt;ref&gt;Chroniques, in ''Bibliothèque de l'École des chartes'', 1959, volume 117, p. 386 [archive].&lt;/ref&gt;). Its training was considered to be outdated and lacking in the latest approaches to history, notably the historiographic revival of the [[Annales School]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Renoult, 'Les formations à la recherche de leurs réformes', in ''Histoire des bibliothèques françaises'', 2e éd., volume IV, p. 847-858, particularly p. 848.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 1990s, when the entrance examination and teaching were reformed and a new policy was introduced, that the school really saw a revival. It entered a period of development under the direction of Yves-Marie Bercé (1992-2001) and Anita Guerreau-Jalabert (2001-2006). The current development of the school is based on solid training in new technologies and their application to the conservation of cultural heritage, and closer, more structured links with French universities and similar institutions in other European countries. The teaching has also been restructured to be better suited to the current demands of scientific research and evolution in conservation jobs. This approach will be introduced gradually as of the academic year 2014-15.

Since the current director, Jean-Michel Leniaud, took up his post in 2011, the school has once more reformed its entrance examination to focus student recruitment on the specifics of the training, while also expanding the training to a broader field of human and social sciences, adapting it to the European context and recruitment conditions within conservation organizations. The range of subjects taught, which was expanded in the 1990s to include history of art, now also includes archeology, history of contemporary law, and history of property law. The course has been extended from three years to three years and nine months, aligning training in fundamental scientific techniques with empowerment in conservation jobs. In no other social and human sciences institution is the study of history, philology and law integrated to this extent into the conservation of archives, books monuments and works of art, be they inventories, historic monuments or museums.

As well as improving the recruitment process and upgrading the training of future archivist-paleographers, the school has introduced specialized Master’s programs focusing on digital technologies adapted to the humanities. It has recently introduced a continuing training service that takes into account the ''validation des acquis de l’expérience (VAE)'' (a certification accrediting work experience).
The school’s collaboration with the Établissement Public de Coopération Scientific (Campus Condorcet Paris-Aubervilliers), the ComUE heSam University and the Sorbonne Universities demonstrates the new directions that it has taken in recent years. To this end, it has modernized its administration, implemented ambitious communications programs and established a new campus opposite the National Library on rue de Richelieu. It is thus preparing to fulfill as effectively as possible the public service role assigned to it by the government.

==Missions==
The École nationale des chartes is regulated by the statute of 27 January 1984, modified by statute no. 2013-660 of 22 July 2013 which relates to higher education and research. Article 3 of decree no. 87-832 of 8 October 1897 modified by decree no. 2005-1751 of 30 December 2005 defines the missions of the school as follows:
"The mission of the École nationale des chartes is to provide training for the scientific staff of archives and libraries. It trains those who contribute to scientific knowledge and the protection of national heritage. It engages in the training and research of students in the human and social sciences, particularly in disciplines relating to critical study, exploitation, conservation and communication of historic sources.”

==Organization==
The governing bodies are composed of the director of the School, the administrative council and the scientific council. 
The director is selected from among the directors of studies of the [[École pratique des hautes études]], the École nationale des chartes and the École française d’Extrême-Orient, or from among professors of the universities and members of affiliated institutions.

==== Entrance examinations ====
French students are recruited by competitive examination prepared in literary-oriented ''[[classes préparatoires]]'' in and outside Paris. Since 1991, it has been divided into two sections:
* The Section A, “Classics”. This includes, among other subjects, [[medieval history]], [[modern history]] and [[Latin]]. Studies at the School require fluency in Latin. 
* Section B, "Modern". This is part of the École normale supérieure’s ''banque d’epreuves littéraires'' (BEL), a set of entrance examinations valid for several schools, and includes [[modern history]], [[contemporary history]] and modern languages among its subjects.

Students prepare for the entrance examination in dedicated ''[[classes préparatoires]]'', the first year of which is known as “hypochartes” and the second year “chartes”. Depending on the school, students preparing for examination A and those preparing for examination B may be grouped into a single cohort with different options, or they may be divided into two different cohorts. Those preparing for Section B can be grouped into ''[[:fr:Classes préparatoires littéraires|khâgnes]]'' with additional options. 
Candidates who can provide proof of at least a [[bachelor’s degree]] in theory may take an examination to be allowed to proceed directly into the second year. This examination is aimed at candidates who are already conducting research at an advanced level. 
There is now a limit on the number of candidates taking the entrance examination. It was reduced from 30 to 20 in three years, which was lower than the number of jobs available to graduates of the school ( in archives, libraries, museums, etc.).

==== Status of the students ====
[[File:Fer a cheval ENC n05.jpg|left|thumb|The "Horseshoe Room" on the first floor of the library]]
Students recruited by competitive examination can assume the status of trainee civil servants, being paid (currently approximately €1250/month net) in exchange for committing to a ten-year engagement. Those who pass the examination may choose whether or not to accept this status. Foreign students who are recruited by examination or on the basis of qualifications (according to the international selection procedure) are not remunerated while they follow the course, although they can apply for a scholarship.

The course duration is three years and nine months 38. At the end of their studies, the students submit a [[thesis]], which qualifies them as [[:fr:Archiviste paléographe|archivist-paleographers]].

Those who have fulfilled their third-year obligations can apply for two ''[[:fr:École d'application|écoles d’application]]'' : the [[:fr:École nationale supérieure des sciences de l'information et des bibliothèques|École nationale supérieure des sciences de l’information et des bibliothèques]] (Enssib,reserved competitive examination&lt;ref&gt;A number of positions as State Curators are reserved for Chartists, but no positions as territorial curators are reserved.&lt;/ref&gt;) and the [[:fr:Institut national du patrimoine (France)|Institut national du patrimoine]] (INP). Following their studies in these schools, they may join the professions of either curators of libraries or curators of heritage. Each year, a number of students sit the INP’s examination in the visual branches (Museums, Historic Monuments and Inventories) or the ''agrégation'' examination (History, Classic or Modern Letters and Grammar), thus following either a research-oriented or a teaching-oriented career path.

==== Training and teaching ====
The course takes place over eight semesters, of which six are dedicated to teaching. As well as a common core of subjects, students choose options according to their scientific and professional objectives. These options can be taken externally through a university. Internships play an important role, with a five-month compulsory internship in an institution in the field of conservation (e.g. archives, libraries, museums, or heritage or archeological services) in France, and three months in a similar institution abroad. 
The principal subjects studied are:&lt;ref&gt;Complete list of modules by semester on the website of the École [archive]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Latin and French [[paleography]] (plus other languages in seminars)
* archiving, diplomacy and history of the institutions that have produced these archives (medieval, modern and contemporary)
* history of civil and canon law
* history of contemporary law
* Roman [[philology]]
* [[medieval Latin]]
* history of art (medieval, modern and contemporary)
* archeology
* editing of texts
* [[bibliography]]
* [[history of books]]
* manuscripts and medieval literary texts
* statistics and cartography for the study of history
* modern languages and IT
ECTS credits are allocated to the subjects, making it possible for students from universities or other ''grandes écoles'' to follow some of them and for the subjects to be included in the external students’ Master’s qualifications. This is made possible by the new [[:fr:Réforme Licence-Master-Doctorat|LMD reform]], which harmonizes French academic qualifications with other European ones. Classes are also open to independent auditors.

=== Master’s ===
[[File:Grande salle ENC n3.jpg|thumb|The "Great Room" (a classroom) with a mural depicting the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]]
In 2006 the École des chartes introduced a Master’s program in Digital Technologies Applied to History, and has since then trained approximately 20 students per year.&lt;ref&gt;The Master’s course on the website of the École [archive]&lt;/ref&gt; In the first year, all students take the same basic modules plus three options (archiving, history of books and media, and history of art). The first year of the Master’s is a continuance of the École des chartes undergraduate training. In the second year, students follow more specialized training in the field of IT applied to webcasting. There are two possible paths, one more research-oriented and the other, which is more vocational, oriented towards the dissemination of knowledge in a heritage service.

In 2011, the École des chartes introduced a further two Master’s courses. The first, in Medieval Studies, is offered in partnership with the École normale supérieure, the University of Paris III and the University of Paris IV. Its aim is to “provide training in literary research for medieval texts, with an interdisciplinary approach in the context of specialization in the Middle Ages”.  The second, run in partnership with the [[École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay]] and the [[:fr:Institut national de l'audiovisuel|Institut national de l’audiovisuel]], is in Audiovisual Design: Plurimedial Representations of History, Society and Science. It aims to “train designers and makers of audiovisual documentaries (for cinema, television, radio and internet) as well as creators and heads of multimedia sites operating in the written press and publishing”.

=== Doctorate ===
The École nationale des chartes awards doctorates in the subjects that it teaches. Any student holding a master's degree, whether or not it was awarded by the École des chartes, can apply to enroll in a doctoral program at the school. The doctorate is prepared through two collaborating doctoral schools: the École pratique des hautes études (for doctorates in medieval history, history of art, archeology, Roman philology and Latin) and the Paris Sorbonne University (for doctorates in modern and contemporary history).

=== The Institut national du patrimoine’s ''classe préparatoire intégrée'' ===

Detailed article : [[:fr:Institut national du patrimoine (France)|Institut national du patrimoine (France)]].

The École des chartes provides part of the preparation for the competitive examination for heritage curators (archive specialization) for students of the INP’s ''classe préparatoire intégrée''. These students are selected on the basis of social and academic criteria.

== Research ==
[[File:Buste Quicherat Petit ENC n01.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of [[Jules Quicherat]] by Jean Petit]]
Most of the professors at the École nationale des chartes are affiliated to the Centre Jean-Mabillon, the École’s research unit, whose director is currently [[:fr:Olivier Poncet|Olivier Poncet]].
The aim of the center’s research program to cover all the processes that explain and publicize the written production from the Middle Ages to the present, through various stages : 
* the conditions of production (axis 1: the cultures of writing from the Middle Ages to the 21st century)
* the mechanisms of heritage transmission (axis 2: genesis and tradition of written heritage: author, institutions, laws, study, etc.)
* the conditions of returning of this historic documentation to the scientific community (axis 3: epistemology and the norms of editing texts and images in the digital age)

A significant part of the school’s research activity is the theses of the students, whose fields of studies have diversified over the years and now relate to all periods of history, notably contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;See the thesis abstracts [archive] of recent years, demonstrating the diversity of the research carried out&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==
[[File:EScan Digibook scanner ENC.jpg|thumb|A scanner in the library, available for students’ use]]
Partnerships with other institutions form one of the central policies of the current administration, which collaborates closely with the [[École pratique des hautes études]], the [[:fr:Institut de recherche et d'histoire des textes|Institut de recherche et d’histoire des textes]] and the Centre d’études superieures de civilisation médiévale of the [[University of Poitiers]] to create the École d’Érudition en réseau. The École des chartes is also part of the Institut d’histoire du livre together with the City of Lyon (its municipal library and Museum of printing works), the École normale supérieure of Lyon and the [[:fr:École nationale supérieure des sciences de l'information et des bibliothèques|Enssib]].

The École des chartes also collaborates with other higher education establishments in Paris to form the [[:fr:HeSam Université|ComUE heSam University]], the [[:fr:Sorbonne Universités|ComUE Sorbonne Universities]] and the [[:fr:Campus Condorcet|Campus Condorcet Paris-Aubervilliers]].
 
The school also has partnerships with institutions outside France, such as the Russian State Archives, a number of Moscow libraries, the [[University of Alicante]], and Italian research centers 45. The school takes in a number of foreign students, who are often Swiss, Belgian or from francophone African countries, and is currently seeking to attract new students for shorter stays, through partnerships with universities. The school’s students are also regularly invited to do internships in archives or libraries in other countries.

== The library ==
The library was created by the order of 31 December 1846. At the time it occupied one of the two rooms reserved for the school in the [[hôtel de Soubise]]. The library moved with the school in 1897, and since then has occupied the second floor (reading room and history room), third floor (Horseshoe Room) and fourth floor (offices and store rooms in the attic).

In 1920, the management of the library was taken over by the secretary of the school, who at the time was [[René Poupardin]]. Today it is managed by a library curator.

It was designed as a research library. Its collections are particularly well supplied in the subjects taught at the school: medieval history, philology, history of books, bibliography, etc. The collections (around 150,000 volumes) are all available for immediate access. The catalogue is available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.enc.sorbonne.fr/ Catalog of the library of the school]&lt;/ref&gt; Many electronic resources are also available.
 
Due to lack of space at the Sorbonne, the library will move in 2016 to 12 rue des Petits-Champs, into much larger premises.

== Dissemination of knowledge ==

The École nationale des chartes disseminates scientific works in its fields of specialization, in printed and electronic format.  
It has published four collections of works in printed format :
* ''Mémoires et Documents'', a collection dating from 1896, consisting of monographs, most notably the theses of École des chartes alumni
* ''Études et Rencontres'', a collection begun in 1998, principally consisting of the minutes of scientific meetings
* ''Matériaux pour l’Histoire'', a collection inaugurated in 1996, consisting of richly illustrated quarto volumes
* ''Études et documents'' for a Gallia Pontificia, a collection jointly edited by the École nationale des chartes and the German Historical Institute of Paris since 2009 with the aim of presenting the work carried out  as part of the ''Gallia Pontificia'', a scientific enterprise that aims to identify, publish and study the papal acts concerning France dating from before 1198

The École des chartes also publishes two periodic publications relating to the training it offers :
* ''Abstracts of theses'' submitted by students to obtain their qualification of archivist-paleographer, published annually by the École des chartes since 1849. Since 2000, they have also been available online 
* ''Hypotheses''. Works of the University of Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne doctoral school of history and the École nationale des chartes, co-edited by the École nationale des chartes and Sorbonne publications since 2010
These works are disseminated by CID-FMSH, through the Comptoir des presses de l’université.
Since 2002, the École des chartes has also published scientific works in electronic format in its online collection of publications, the Éditions en ligne de l’École des chartes (ELEC). This gives scientific works digital functions and brings together repertoires and databases as well as texts, in a format that is more suited than printed versions to detailed examination.
This collection is completed by :
* corpora of text made available online for research purposes, unedited by the École des charts
* teaching materials, available on the THELEME website
* a space for presentation of the IT tools and methods developed by the École des chartes
These materials are under open license.

The school develops its scientific and teaching work through several initiatives, including the Thélème website 48, which offers materials supporting the subjects taught at the school, such as educational packs, advice, lessons, and interactive facsimiles.

== École des chartes publications ==
The École des chartes also publishes numerous works, in both paper and electronic format. The ''Mémoires et documents de l’École des chartes'' are monographs, many of them drawn from École des chartes theses or doctoral research. The first of these was published in 1896 and they are distributed by [[Honoré Champion]] and [[Droz]]. Two more collections, the ''Études et rencontres'' (minutes of conventions and brief monographs) and ''Matériaux pour l’histoire'' (illustrated large-format albums), have been created more recently. ELEC is also responsible for the school’s online publications, which include databases, editions of texts, minutes of symposia, bibliographies, and studies.

==The Société de l'École des chartes ==
The Société de l’École des chartes is a registered as a public-interest association which students and alumni can join. Its current president is Marie-Paule Arnauld, who was elected on 29 May 2010, replacing [[:fr:Bernard Barbiche|Bernard Barbiche]]. Twice a year, the Société publishes the ''Bibliothèque de l’École des chartes'' with the support of the École. This scientific review, founded in 1839, is one of the oldest in France.
