'''5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid''' ('''5-HETE''', '''5(''S'')-HETE''', or '''5''S''-HETE''') is an [[eicosanoid]], i.e. a metabolite of [[arachidonic acid]]. It is produced by diverse cell types in humans and other animal species. These cells may then metabolize the formed 5(''S'')-HETE to [[5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid]] (5-oxo-ETE), 5(''S''),15(''S'')-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5(''S''),15(''S'')-diHETE), or 5-oxo-15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-15(''S'')-HETE). 

5(''S'')-HETE, 5-oxo-ETE, 5(''S''),15(''S'')-diHETE, and 5-oxo-15(''S'')-HETE, while differing in potencies, share a common mechanism for activating cells and a common set of activities. They are therefore a family of structurally related metabolites. Animal studies and a limited set of human studies suggest that this family of metabolites serve as [[hormone]]-like [[autocrine signalling|autocrine]] and [[paracrine signalling]] agents that contribute to the up-regulation of acute [[inflammation|inflammatory]] and [[allergic]] responses. In this capacity, these metabolites may be members of the [[innate immune system]]. 

''[[In vitro]]'' studies suggest that 5(''S'')-HETE and/or other of its family members may also be active in promoting the growth of certain types of cancers, in simulating bone reabsorption, in signaling for the secretion of [[aldosterone]] and [[progesterone]], in triggering [[parturition]], and in contributing to other responses in animals and humans. However, the roles of 5(''S'')-HETE family members in these responses as well as in inflammation and allergy are unproven and will require much further study. 

Among the 5(''S'')-HETE family members, 5(''S'')-HETE takes precedence over the other members of this family because it was the first to be discovered and has been studied far more thoroughly. However, 5-oxo-ETE is the most potent member of this family and therefore may be its critical member with respect to [[physiology]] and [[pathology]]. 5-OxoETE has gained attention in recent studies. 
 
== Nomenclature ==
5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid is more properly termed 5(''S'')-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid or 5(''S'')-HETE) to signify the (''S'') [[Chirality (chemistry)|configuration]] of its 5-[[hydroxyl|hydroxy]] residue as opposed to its 5(''R'')-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid (i.e., 5(''R'')-HETE) [[stereoisomer]]. Since 5(''R'')-HETE was rarely considered in the early literature, 5(''S'')-HETE was frequently termed 5-HETE. This practice occasionally continues. 5(''S'')-HETE's [[IUPAC]] name, (5''S'',6''E'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z'')-5-hydroxyicosa-6,8,11,14-tetraenoic acid, defines 5(''S'')-HETE's structure unambiguously by notating not only its ''S''-hydroxyl chirality but also the [[cis–trans isomerism]] geometry for each of its 4 [[double bond]]s; E signifies trans and Z signifies cis double bond geometry. The literature commonly uses an alternate but still unambiguous name for 5(''S'')-HETE viz., 5''(S)''-hydroxy-6''E'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid.

== History of discovery ==
The Nobel laureate, [[Bengt I. Samuelsson]], and colleagues first described 5(''S'')-HETE in 1976 as a metabolite of arachidonic acid made by rabbit [[neutrophils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Borgeat P, Hamberg M, Samuelsson B | title = Transformation of arachidonic acid and homo-gamma-linolenic acid by rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Monohydroxy acids from novel lipoxygenases | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 251 | issue = 24 | pages = 7816–20 | date = December 1976 | pmid = 826538 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological activity was linked to it several years later when it was found to stimulate human neutrophil rises in cytosolic calcium, [[chemotaxis]], and increases in their cell surface adhesiveness as indicated by their aggregation to each other.&lt;ref name="pmid1668115"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rossi AG, O'Flaherty JT | title = Bioactions of 5-hydroxyicosatetraenoate and its interaction with platelet-activating factor | journal = Lipids | volume = 26 | issue = 12 | pages = 1184–8 | date = December 1991 | pmid = 1668115 | doi=10.1007/bf02536528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a previously discovered arachidonic acid metabolite made by neutrophils, [[leukotriene B4]] (LTB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), also stimulates human neutrophil calcium rises, chemotaxis, and auto-aggregation and is structurally similar to 5(''S'')-HETE in being a 5-(''S'')-hydroxy-eicosateraenoate, it was assumed that 5-(''S'')-HETE stimulated cells through the same [[cell surface receptor]]s as those used by (LTB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) viz., the [[leukotriene B4 receptor]]s. However, further studies in neutrophils indicated that 5-(''S'')-HETE acts through a receptor distinct from that used by LTB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as well as various other neutrophil stimuli. This 5(''S'')-HETE receptor is termed the [[oxoeicosanoid receptor 1]] (abbreviated as (OXER1).&lt;ref name="W Powell"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Taylor JS, Thomas MJ | title = Receptors for the 5-oxo class of eicosanoids in neutrophils | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 273 | issue = 49 | pages = 32535–41 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9829988 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.273.49.32535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell WS, Rokach J | title = Biochemistry, biology and chemistry of the 5-lipoxygenase product 5-oxo-ETE | journal = Progress in Lipid Research | volume = 44 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 154–83 | date = Mar 2005 | pmid = 15893379 | doi = 10.1016/j.plipres.2005.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 5''(S)''-HETE Production ==
5(S)-HETE is a product of the cellular metabolism of the n-6 [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]], arachidonic acid (i.e. 5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid), by [[ALOX5]] (also termed arachidonate-5-lipoxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase, 5-LO, and 5-LOX). ALOX5 metabolizes arachidonic acid to its [[hydroperoxide]] derivative, [[arachidonic acid 5-hydroperoxide]] i.e. 5''S''-hydroperoxy-6''E'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(''S'')-HpETE). 5-(''S'')-HpETE may then be released and rapidly converted to 5(''S'')-HETE by ubiquitous cellular [[peroxidase]]s:
&lt;center&gt;
Arachidonic acid) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 5(''S'')-HpETE → 5(''S'')-HETE&lt;/center&gt;
Alternatively, 5(''S'')-HpETE may be further metabolized to its [[epoxide]], 5(6)-oxido-eicosatetraenoic acid viz., [[leukotriene A4]] (i.e. ''S'',6''S''-oxido-7''E'',9''E'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid). Leukotriene A4 may then be further metabolized either to [[leukotriene B4]] by [[leukotriene A4 hydrolase]] or to [[leukotriene C4]] by [[leukotriene C4 synthase]]. Finally, leukotriene C4 may be metabolized to [[leukotriene D4]] and then to [[leukotriene E4]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rådmark O, Werz O, Steinhilber D, Samuelsson B | title = 5-Lipoxygenase, a key enzyme for leukotriene biosynthesis in health and disease | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1851 | issue = 4 | pages = 331–9 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25152163 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.08.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The relative amounts of these metabolites made by specific cells and tissues depends in large part on the relative content of the appropriate enzymes.

The selective synthesis of 5(''S'')-HETE (i.e. synthesis of 5(''S'')-HETE without concurrent synthesis of 5(''R'')-HETE) by cells is dependent on, and generally proportionate to, the presence and levels of its forming enzyme, ALOX5. Human ALOX5 is highly expressed in cells that regulate [[innate immunity]] responses, particularly those involved in [[inflammation]] and [[allergy]]. Examples of such cells include [[neutrophils]], [[eosinophils]], [[B lymphocytes]], [[monocytes]], [[macrophages]], [[mast cells]], [[dendritic cells]], and the monocyte-derived [[foam cells]] of [[atherosclerosis]] tissues.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; ALOX5 is also expressed but usually at relatively low levels in many other cell types. The production of 5''(S'')-HETE by these cells typically serves a physiological function. However, ALOX5 can become overexpressed at high levels in certain types of human cancer cells such as those of the prostate, lung, colon, colorectal and pancreatic as a consequence of their [[malignant transformation]]. In these cells, the ALOX5-dependent production of 5''(S)''-HETE appears to serve a pathological function viz., it promotes the growth and spread of the cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Osher E, Weisinger G, Limor R, Tordjman K, Stern N | title = The 5 lipoxygenase system in the vasculature: emerging role in health and disease | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 252 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 201–6 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16647809 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2006.03.038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28125014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore GY, Pidgeon GP | title = Cross-Talk between Cancer Cells and the Tumour Microenvironment: The Role of the 5-Lipoxygenase Pathway | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | page = 236| year = 2017 | pmid = 28125014 | pmc = 5343774 | doi = 10.3390/ijms18020236 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bishayee K, Khuda-Bukhsh AR | title = 5-lipoxygenase antagonist therapy: a new approach towards targeted cancer chemotherapy | journal = Acta Biochimica et Biophysica Sinica | volume = 45 | issue = 9 | pages = 709–19 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23752617 | doi = 10.1093/abbs/gmt064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22002716"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schneider C, Pozzi A | title = Cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases in cancer | journal = Cancer Metastasis Reviews | volume = 30 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 277–94 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22002716 | pmc = 3798028 | doi = 10.1007/s10555-011-9310-3 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

5(''S'')-HETE may also be made in combination with 5(''R'')-HETE along with numerous other ''(S,R)''-hydroxy [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s as a consequence of the non-enzymatic oxidation reactions. Formation of these products can occur in any tissue subjected to [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref name="pmid24056189"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell WS, Rokach J | title = The eosinophil chemoattractant 5-oxo-ETE and the OXE receptor | journal = Progress in Lipid Research | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 651–65 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24056189 | doi = 10.1016/j.plipres.2013.09.001 | pmc=5710732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7258296"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Thomas MJ, Lees CJ, McCall CE | title = Neutrophil-aggregating activity of monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids | journal = The American Journal of Pathology | volume = 104 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–62 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7258296 | pmc = 1903737 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 5''(S)''-HETE metabolism ==
In addition to its intrinsic activity, 5(''S'')-ETE can serve as an intermediate that is converted to other bioactive products. Most importantly, [[5-Hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase]] (i.e. 5-HEDH) converts the 5-hydroxy residue of 5''(S)''-HETE to a [[ketone]] residue to form [[5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid]] (i.e. 5-oxo-6''E'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoate, abbreviated as 5-oxo-ETE). 5-HEDH is a reversibly acting [[NADP+|NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]/[[NADPH]]-dependent enzyme that catalyzes to following reaction:

&lt;center&gt;
5''(S)''-HETE + [[NADP+|NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; 5-oxo-ETE + [[NADPH]]&lt;/center&gt;

5-HEDH acts bi-directionally: it preferentially oxygenates 5''(S'')-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE in the presence of excess NADH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; but preferentially reduces 5-oxo-ETE back to 5(''S'')-HETE in the presence of excess NADPH. Since cells typically maintain far higher levels of NADPH than NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, they usually make little or no 5-oxo-ETE. When undergoing [[oxidative stress]], however, cells contain higher levels of NADH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; than NADPH and make 5-oxo-ETE preferentially. Additionally, [[in vitro]] studies indicate that cells can transfer their 5''(S'')-HETE to cells that contain high levels of 5-NEDH and NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and therefore convert the transferred 5''(S'')-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE. It is suggested that 5-oxo-ETE forms preferentially [[in vivo]] under conditions of [[oxidative stress]] or conditions where [[ALOX5]]-rich cells can transfer their 5''(S)''-HETE to cells epithelial, endothelial, dendritic, and certain (e.g. prostate, breast, and lung) cancer cells which display little or no ALOX5 activity but have high levels of 5-NEDH and NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Since 5-oxo-ETE is 30- to 100-fold more potent than 5(''S'')-HETE, 5-HEDH main function may be to increase the biological impact of 5-HETE production.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;

*An [[acyltransferase]] to [[ester]]ify 5(''S'')-HETE into their membrane [[phospholipids]]. This reaction may serve to storing 5(''S'')-HETE for its release during subsequent cell stimulation and/or alter the properties of cell membranes in functionally important ways. 
*A [[cytochrome P450]], probably [[CYP4F3]], to metabolize 5(''S'')-HETE to 5-(''S''),20-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoate (5,20-diHETE).

*[[ALOX15]] to metabolize 5(''S'')-HETE to 5-(''S''),15-(''S'')-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoate (5,15-diHETE). 5,15-diHETE is ~3- to 10-fold weaker than 5(''S'')-HETE in stimulating cells.

== Mechanism of action ==
=== The OXER1 receptor ===
5-(''S'')-HETE family members share a common receptor target for stimulating cells that differs from the receptors targeted by the other major products of ALOX5, i.e., [[leukotriene B4]], [[leukotriene C4]], [[leukotriene D4]], [[leukotriene E4]], [[lipoxin]] A4, and [[lipoxin]] B4. It and other members of the 5-(''S'')-HETE family stimulate cells primarily by binding and thereby activating a dedicated [[G protein-coupled receptor]], the [[oxoeicosanoid receptor 1]] (i.e. OXER1, also termed the OXE, OXE-R, hGPCR48, HGPCR48, or R527 receptor).&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Rossi AG | title = 5-hydroxyicosatetraenoate stimulates neutrophils by a stereospecific, G protein-linked mechanism | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 268 | issue = 20 | pages = 14708–14 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 8392058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  OXER1 couples to the [[G protein]] complex composed of the [[Gi alpha subunit]] (Gαi) and [[G beta-gamma complex]] (Gβγ); when bound to a 5-(''S'')-HETE family member, OXER1 triggers this G protein complex to dissociate into its Gαi and Gβγ components with Gβγ appearing to be the component responsible for activating the signal pathways which lead to cellular functional responses.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  The cell-activation pathways stimulated by OXER1 include those mobilizing calcium ions and activating [[MAPK/ERK]], [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases]], cytosolic [[phospholipase A2]], [[PI3K]]/[[Akt]], and [[protein kinase C]] beta and epsilon.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell WS, Rokach J | title = The eosinophil chemoattractant 5-oxo-ETE and the OXE receptor | journal = Progress in Lipid Research | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 651–65 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24056189 | doi = 10.1016/j.plipres.2013.09.001 | pmc=5710732}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relative potencies of 5-oxo-ETE, 5-oxo-15(''S'')-HETE, 5-(''S'')-HETE, 5-(''S''),15-(''S'')-diHETE, 5-oxo-20-hydroxy-ETE, 5-(''S''),20-diHETE, and 5,15-dioxo-ETE in binding to, activating, and thereby stimulating cell responses through the OXER1 receptor are ~100, 30, 5-10, 1-3, 1-3, 1, and &lt;1, respectively.&lt;ref name="W Powell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Cordes JF, Lee SL, Samuel M, Thomas MJ | title = Chemical and biological characterization of oxo-eicosatetraenoic acids | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1201 | issue = 3 | pages = 505–15 | date = December 1994 | pmid = 7803484 | doi = 10.1016/0304-4165(94)90083-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other receptors ===
Progress in proving the role of the 5-HETE family of agonists and their OXER1 receptor in human physiology and disease has been made difficult because mice, rats, and the other rodents so far tested lack OXER1. Rodents are the most common [[in vivo]] models for investigating these issues. OXER1 is expressed in non-human primates, a wide range of other mammals, and various fish species and a model of allergic airways disease in cats, which express OXER1 and make 5-oxo-ETE, has recently been developed for such studies.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biochem Pharmacol 2015"/&gt; In any event, cultured mouse MA-10 [[Leydig cell]]s, while responding to 5-oxo-ETE, lack OXER1. It is suggested that this cell's, as well as mouse and other rodent, responses to 5-oxo-ETE are mediated by a receptor closely related to OXER11 viz., the mouse [[niacin receptor 1]], Niacr1. Niacr1, an [[ortholog]] of OXER1, is a G protein-coupled receptor for [[niacin]], and responds to 5-oxo-ETE.&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/j.mce.2012.11.003"/&gt; It has also been suggested that one or more of the mouse hydroxycarboxylic acid (HCA) family of the G protein-coupled receptors, HCA1 ([[GPR81]]), HCA2 ([[GPR109A]]), and HCA3 ([[GPR109B]]), which are G protein-coupled receptors for fatty acids may be responsible for rodent responses to 5-oxo-ETE.&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/j.mce.2012.11.003"/&gt; It is possible that human cellular responses to 5-oxo-ETE and perhaps its analogs may involve, at least in isolated instances, one or more of these receptors.

=== PPARγ ===
5-Oxo-15(S)-hydroxy-ETE and to a lesser extent 5-oxo-ETE but not 5-(''S'')-HETE also bind to and activate [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma]] (PPARγ). Activation of OXER1 receptor and PPARγ by the oxo analogs can have opposing effects on cells. For example, 5-oxo-ETE-bound OXER1 stimulates while 5-oxo-ETE-bound PPARγ inhibits the proliferation of various types of human cancer cell lines.&lt;ref name="Biochim.

=== Other mechanisms ===
5-(''S'')-HETE acylated into the [[phosphatidylethanolamine]]s fraction of human neutrophil membranes is associated with the inhibition of these cells from forming [[neutrophil extracellular traps]], i.e. extracellular DNA scaffolds which contain neutrophil-derived antimicrobial proteins that circulate in blood and have the ability to trap bacteria. It seems unlikely that this inhibition reflects involvement of OXER1.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clark SR, Guy CJ, Scurr MJ, Taylor PR, Kift-Morgan AP, Hammond VJ, Thomas CP, Coles B, Roberts GW, Eberl M, Jones SA, Topley N, Kotecha S, O'Donnell VB | title = Esterified eicosanoids are acutely generated by 5-lipoxygenase in primary human neutrophils and in human and murine infection | journal = Blood | volume = 117 | issue = 6 | pages = 2033–43 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21177434 | pmc = 3374621 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2010-04-278887 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 5-Oxo-ETE relaxes pre-contracted human bronchi by a mechanism that does not appear to involve OXER1 but is otherwise undefined.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17499751"/&gt;

== Clinical significance ==

=== Inflammation ===
5(''S'')-HETE and other family members were first detected as products of arachidonic acid made by stimulated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils ([[Polymorphonuclear neutrophil|PMN]]), a leukocyte blood cell type involved in host immune defense against infection but also implicated in aberrant pro-inflammatory immune responses such as arthritis; soon thereafter they found to be active also in stimulating these cells to migrate (i.e. chemotaxis), degranulate (i.e. release the anti-bacterial and tissue-injuring contents of their granules), produce bacteriocidal and tissue-injuring [[reactive oxygen species]], and mount other pro-defensive as well as pro-inflammatory responses of the [[Innate immune system]]. For example, the [[gram-negative bacterium]], [[Salmonella tryphimurium]], and the outer surface of gram negative bacteria, [[Lipopolysaccharide]], promote the production of 5-(''S'')-HETE and 5-oxo-ETE by human neutrophils. The family members stimulate another blood cell of the [[innate immunity]] system, the human [[monocyte]], acting synergistically with the pro-inflammatory [[CC chemokines]], [[monocyte chemotactic protein-1]] and monocyte chemotactic protein-3, to stimulate monocyte function.  5-Oxo-ETE also stimulates two other cell types that share responsibility with the PMN for regulating inflammation, the human [[lymphocyte]] and [[dendritic cell]]. And, in vivo studies, the injection of 5-oxo-ETE into the skin of human volunteers causes the local accumulation of PMN and monocyte-derived [[macrophages]].&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;  Furthermore, the production of one or more 5(''S'')-HETE family members as well as the expression of orthologs of the human OXER1 receptor occur in various mammalian species including dogs, cats, cows, sheep, elephants, pandas, opossums, and ferrets and in several species of fish; for example, cats undergoing experimentally induced asthma accumulate 5-oxo-ETE in their lung lavage fluid, feline leucocytes make as well as respond to 5-oxo-ETE by an oxer1-dependent mechanism; and an OXER1 ortholog and, apparently, 5-oxo-ETE are necessary for the inflammatory response to tissue damage caused by osmolarity insult in [[zebrafish]].&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Enyedi B, Kala S, Nikolich-Zugich T, Niethammer P | title = Tissue damage detection by osmotic surveillance | journal = Nature Cell Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 9 | pages = 1123–30 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23934216 | pmc = 3826879 | doi = 10.1038/ncb2818 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biochem Pharmacol 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cossette C, Gravel S, Reddy CN, Gore V, Chourey S, Ye Q, Snyder NW, Mesaros CA, Blair IA, Lavoie JP, Reinero CR, Rokach J, Powell WS | title = Biosynthesis and actions of 5-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) on feline granulocytes | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 247–55 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26032638 | pmc = 4830392 | doi = 10.1016/j.bcp.2015.05.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These results given above suggest that members of the 5-oxo-ETE family and the OXER1 receptor or its orthologs may contribute to protection against microbes, the repair of damaged tissues, and pathological inflammatory responses in humans and other animal species.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014" /&gt;  However, an OXER1 ortholog is absent in mice and other rodents; while rodent tissues do exhibit responsiveness to 5-oxo-ETE, the lack of an oxer1 or other clear 5-oxoETE receptor in such valued animal models of diseases as rodents has impeded progress in our understanding of the physiological and pathological roles of 5-oxo-ETE.&lt;ref name="Biochem Pharmacol 2015"/&gt;

=== Allergy ===
The following human cell types or tissues that are implicated in allergic reactivity produce 5-HETE (stereoisomer typically not defined): alveolar macrophages isolated from asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients, [[basophils]] isolated from blood and challenged with anti-IgE antibody, [[mast cells]] isolated from lung, cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells, isolated human pulmonary vasculature, and allergen-sensitized human lung specimens challenged with specific allergen.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grant GE, Rokach J, Powell WS | title = 5-Oxo-ETE and the OXE receptor | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 89 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 98–104 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19450703 | pmc = 2906239 | doi = 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2009.05.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, cultured human airway epithelial cell lines, normal bronchial epithelium, and bronchial smooth muscle cells convert 5-(''S'')-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE in a reaction that is greatly increase by oxidative stress, which is a common component in allergic inflammatory reactions.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt; Finally, 5-HETE is found in the [[bronchoalveolar lavage fluid]] of asthmatic humans and 5-oxo-ETE is found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of cats undergoing allergen-induced bronchospasm.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biochem Pharmacol 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dworski R, Fitzgerald GA, Oates JA, Sheller JR | title = Effect of oral prednisone on airway inflammatory mediators in atopic asthma | journal = American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 149 | issue = 4 Pt 1 | pages = 953–9 | date = April 1994 | pmid = 8143061 | doi = 10.1164/ajrccm.149.4.8143061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the 5-HETE family of metabolites, 5-oxo-ETE is implicated as the most likely member to contribute to allergic reactions.  It has exceptionally high potency in stimulating the [[chemotaxis]], release of granule-bound tissue-injuring enzymes, and production of tissue-injuring reactive oxygen species of a cell type involved in allergic reactions, the human [[eosinophil granulocyte]].&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;  It is also exceptionally potent in stimulating eosinophils to activate cytosolic phospholipase A2 ([[PLA2G4A]]) and possibly thereby to form [[platelet-activating factor]] (PAF) as well as metabolites of the 5-HETE family.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Kuroki M, Nixon AB, Wijkander J, Yee E, Lee SL, Smitherman PK, Wykle RL, Daniel LW | title = 5-Oxo-eicosatetraenoate is a broadly active, eosinophil-selective stimulus for human granulocytes | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 157 | issue = 1 | pages = 336–42 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8683135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  PAF is itself a proposed mediator of human allergic reactions which commonly forms concurrently with 5-HETE family metabolites in human leukocytes and acts synergistically with these metabolites, particularly 5-oxo-ETE, to stimulate eosinophils.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chilton FH, O'Flaherty JT, Walsh CE, Thomas MJ, Wykle RL, DeChatelet LR, Waite BM | title = Platelet activating factor.

The role of 5-HETE family agonists in the [[bronchoconstriction]] of airways (a hallmark of allergen-induced asthma) in humans is currently unclear.  5-HETE stimulates the contraction of isolated human bronchial muscle, enhances the ability of histamine to contract this muscle, and contracts guinea pig lung strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Copas JL, Borgeat P, Gardiner PJ | title = The actions of 5-, 12-, and 15-HETE on tracheobronchial smooth muscle | journal = Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, and Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 105–14 | date = February 1982 | pmid = 6952280 | doi = 10.1016/s0262-1746(82)80002-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  5-Oxo-ETE also stimulates contractile responses in fresh bronchi, cultured bronchi, and cultured lung smooth muscle taken from guinea pigs but in direct contrast to these studies is reported to relax bronchi isolated from humans.&lt;ref name="pmid17499751"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morin C, Sirois M, Echave V, Gomes MM, Rousseau E | title = Relaxing effects of 5-oxo-ETE on human bronchi involve BK Ca channel activation | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 311–9 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17499751 | doi = 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2007.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morin C, Rousseau E | title = Effects of 5-oxo-ETE and 14,15-EET on reactivity and Ca2+ sensitivity in guinea pig bronchi | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 82 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 30–41 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17164130 | doi = 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2006.05.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mercier F, Morin C, Cloutier M, Proteau S, Rokach J, Powell WS, Rousseau E | title = 5-Oxo-ETE regulates tone of guinea pig airway smooth muscle via activation of Ca2+ pools and Rho-kinase pathway | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

=== Cancer ===
The 5-oxo-ETE family of agonists have also been proposed to contribute to the growth of several types of human cancers.  This is based on their ability to stimulate certain cultured human cancer cell lines to proliferate, the presence of OXER1 mRNA and/or protein in these cell lines, the production of 5-oxo-ETE family members by these cell lines, the induction of cell death (i.e. apoptosis) by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase in these cells, and/or the overexpression of 5-lipoxygenase in tissue taken from the human tumors.  Human cancers whose growth has been implicated by these studies as being mediated at least in part by a member(s) of the 5-oxo-ETE family include those of the prostate, breast, lung, ovary, and pancreas.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biochim.

In an ''in vitro'' mixed culture system, 5-(''S'')-HETE is released by monocytes to stimulate, at sub-nanomolar concentrations, osteoclast-dependent bone reabsorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallwitz WE, Mundy GR, Lee CH, Qiao M, Roodman GD, Raftery M, Gaskell SJ, Bonewald LF | title = 5-Lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid stimulate isolated osteoclasts to resorb calcified matrices | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 268 | issue = 14 | pages = 10087–94 | date = May 1993 | pmid = 8486677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also inhibits morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)-induced bone-like nodule formation in mouse calvarial organ cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Traianedes K, Dallas MR, Garrett IR, Mundy GR, Bonewald LF | title = 5-Lipoxygenase metabolites inhibit bone formation in vitro | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 139 | issue = 7 | pages = 3178–84 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9645691 | doi = 10.1210/endo.139.7.6115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These results allow that 5-(''S'')-HETE and perhaps more potently, 5-oxo-ETE contribute to the regulation of [[bone remodeling]].

'''Bona Dea''' ({{IPA-la|bɔ.na ˈde.a|}} 'Good Goddess') was a [[List of Roman deities|divinity]] in [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]]. She was associated with chastity and fertility in [[Women in ancient Rome|Roman women]], healing, and the protection of the [[SPQR|state and people of Rome]]. According to Roman literary sources, she was brought from [[Magna Graecia]] at some time during the early or middle [[Roman Republic|Republic]], and was given her own [[Religion in ancient Rome#Frameworks of Roman religion|state cult]] on the [[Aventine Hill]].

Her rites allowed women the use of strong wine and blood-sacrifice, things otherwise forbidden them by [[Mos maiorum|Roman tradition]]. Men were barred from her [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]] and the possession of her true name. Given that male authors had limited knowledge of her rites and attributes, ancient speculations about her identity abound, among them that she was an aspect of [[Terra (mythology)|Terra]], [[Ops]], [[Cybele]], or [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], or a [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] form of the Greek goddess "Damia" ([[Demeter]]). Most often, she was identified as the wife, sister, or daughter of the god [[Faunus]], thus an equivalent or aspect of the nature-goddess [[Fauna (deity)|Fauna]], who could prophesy the fates of women.

The goddess had two annual festivals. One was held at her Aventine temple; the other was hosted by the wife of Rome's [[executive magistrates of the Roman Republic|senior Annual Magistrate]] for an invited group of elite matrons and female attendants. The latter festival came to scandalous prominence in 62 BC, when the politician [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] was tried for his intrusion on the rites, allegedly bent on the seduction of [[Julius Caesar]]'s wife, whom Caesar later divorced because "[[Pompeia (wife of Julius Caesar)|Caesar's wife must be above suspicion]]". The rites remained a subject of male curiosity and speculation, both religious and prurient.

Bona Dea's cults in the city of Rome were led by the [[Vestal Virgin]]s, and her [[Roman province|provincial]] cults by virgin or matron priestesses. Surviving statuary shows her as a sedate Roman matron with a [[cornucopia]] and a snake. Personal dedications to her are attested among all classes, especially [[plebs|plebeians]], [[freedman|freedmen and women]], and [[slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]]. Approximately one third of her dedications are from men, some of whom may have been lawfully involved in her cult. 

==Titles, names and origins==
Bona Dea ("The Good Goddess") is both an honorific title and a respectful pseudonym; the goddess' true or cult name is unknown. Her other, less common pseudonyms include ''Feminea Dea'' ("The Women's Goddess"),&lt;ref&gt;In [[Propertius]], 4, 9, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Laudanda ... Dea'' ("The Goddess ... to be Praised"),&lt;ref&gt;[[Lygdamus]], ''Elegia'', 5, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sancta'' ("The Holy One").&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, p.&amp;nbsp;236&amp;nbsp;ff.&lt;/ref&gt; She is a goddess of "no definable type", with several origins and a range of different characteristics and functions.&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, p.&amp;nbsp;323.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on what little they knew of her rites and attributes, Roman historians speculated her true name and identity. [[Festus (historian)|Festus]] describes her as identical with a "women's goddess" named Damia, which [[Georges Dumézil]] sees as an ancient misreading of Greek "[[Demeter]]".&lt;ref&gt;Staples, p.&amp;nbsp;14, cites Dumezil's theory that "Damia" was perhaps probably an ancient misreading or mistranslation of "Demeter", later institutionalised.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, pp.&amp;nbsp;237–238, 240–242, citing Festus, ''Epitome of Flaccus, de Verborum Significatu''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late Imperial era, the [[neoplatonist]] author [[Macrobius]] identifies her as a universal earth-goddess, an epithet of [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]], [[Terra (mythology)|Terra]], or Cybele, worshiped under the names of Ops, Fauna and Fatua.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]] cites [[Cornelius Labeo]] as his source for ''Bona'', ''Fauna'', and ''Fatua'' as ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#indigitamenta|indigitamenta]]'' of [[Terra (mythology)|Terra]] in the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#libri pontificales|Libri Pontificales]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornelius Labeo]] seems to have drawn this theology from the work of [[Varro]]. See Brouwer, p.&amp;nbsp;356, footnote&amp;nbsp;255.&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian author [[Lactantius]], claiming the late Republican polymath [[Varro]] as his source, describes her as [[Faunus]]' wife and sister, named "''Fenta Fauna''" or "''Fenta Fatua''" (Fenta "''the prophetess''" or Fenta "''the foolish''").&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, p.&amp;nbsp;239: citing [[Lactantius]], ''Divinae Institutiones'', 1, 22, 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival and cult==

===Republican era===
The known features of Bona Dea's cults recall those of various earth and fertility goddesses of the [[Greco-Roman world|Graeco-Roman world]], especially the [[Thesmophoria]] festival to Demeter. They included nocturnal rites conducted by predominantly or exclusively female initiates and female priestesses, music, dance and wine, and sacrifice of a sow.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, p.31ff.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Roman Republic]]an era, two such cults to Bona Dea were held at different times and locations in the city of [[Rome]].

One was held on [[Roman festivals#Maius|May 1]] at Bona Dea's [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] temple. Its date connects her to [[Maia (mythology)#Roman Maia|Maia]]; its location connects her to Rome's [[Plebs|plebeian]] commoner class, whose [[tribune]]s and emergent aristocracy resisted [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] claims to rightful religious and political dominance. The festival and temple's foundation year is uncertain &amp;ndash; [[Ovid]] credits it to [[Claudia Quinta]] (c. late 3rd century BC).&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, Fasti, 2, 35; he is the only source for this assertion.&lt;/ref&gt; The rites are inferred as some form of mystery, concealed from the public gaze and, according to most later Roman literary sources, entirely forbidden to men. In the Republican era, Bona Dea's Aventine festivals were probably distinctly [[plebeian]] affairs, open to all classes of women and perhaps, in some limited fashion, to men.&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, p. 398: "And considering the fact that the aristocracy were only a small percentage of the population, it is not surprising that most expressions of Bona Dea worship originate from the lower classes."&lt;/ref&gt; Control of her Aventine cult seems to have been contested at various times during the Mid Republican era; a dedication or rededication of the temple in 123 BC by the [[Vestal Virgin]] Licinia, with the gift of an altar, shrine and couch, was immediately annulled as unlawful by the [[Roman Senate]]; Licinia herself was later charged with inchastity, and executed. By the Late Republic era, Bona Dea's May festival and Aventine temple could have fallen into official disuse, or official disrepute.&lt;ref&gt;Wildfang, pp.92 - 93, citing Cicero, ''De Domo Sua'', 53.136.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The goddess also had a Winter festival, attested on only two occasions (63 and 62 BC). It was held in December, at the home of the current senior annual [[Roman Magistrates|Roman magistrate ''cum imperio'']], whether [[Roman consul|consul]] or [[praetor]]. It was hosted by the magistrate's wife and attended by respectable matrons of the Roman elite. This winter festival is not marked on any known religious calendar but was dedicated to the public interest and supervised by the Vestals, and therefore must be considered official. Shortly after 62 BC, Cicero presents it as one of very few lawful nocturnal festivals allowed to women, privileged to those of aristocratic class, and coeval with Rome's earliest history.&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Festival rites ====
The house was ritually cleansed of all male persons and presences, even male animals and male portraiture. Then the magistrate's wife and her assistants&lt;ref&gt;Possibly, her own female servants.&lt;/ref&gt; made bowers of vine-leaves, and decorated the house's banqueting hall with "all manner of growing and blooming plants" except for [[Myrtus|myrtle]], whose presence and naming were expressly forbidden. A banquet table was prepared, with a couch (pulvinar) for the goddess and the image of a snake. The Vestals brought Bona Dea's cult image from her temple&lt;ref&gt;Presumably her Aventine Temple.&lt;/ref&gt; and laid it upon her couch, as an honoured guest. The goddess' meal was prepared: the entrails ([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#exta|exta]]) of a sow, sacrificed to her on behalf of the Roman people (''pro populo Romano''), and a [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#libatio|libation]] of sacrificial wine.&lt;ref&gt;The sacrifice could have been offered by the Vestals or, according to Plutarch, by the hostess; see [[Bona Dea#Cult themes|Cult themes]] in this article.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival continued through the night, a women-only banquet with female musicians, fun and games (''ludere''), and wine; the last was euphemistically referred to as "milk", and its container as a "honey jar".&lt;ref&gt;Winter festival summary based on Brouwer (1989) as summarised in Versnel, p.32, and Wildfang, p.31. For Roman sources, cf. Plutarch, Lives: Life of Caesar, ix (711E), Life of Cicero, xix (870B); Juvenal, vi.339 (a satirical treatment); and Plutarch, Roman Questions, (Loeb), 20 - 35, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/A.html available via link to Bill Thayer's website]&lt;/ref&gt; The rites sanctified the temporary removal of customary constraints imposed on Roman women of all classes by [[Mos maiorum|Roman tradition]], and underlined the pure and lawful sexual potency of virgins and matrons in a context that excluded any reference to male persons or creatures, male lust or seduction,.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cicero, any man who caught even a glimpse of the rites could be punished by blinding. &lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Haruspicum Responsis'' XVII 37 - XVIII 38; cited in Brouwer, pp.165 - 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Roman writers assume that apart from their different dates and locations, Bona Dea's December and May 1 festivals were essentially the same.&lt;ref&gt;See W. Warde Fowler, The Roman Festivals of the period of the Republic, MacMillan (New York, 1899): 102 - 106.[https://www.questia.com/read/23313966?title=The%20Roman%20Festivals%20of%20the%20Period%20of%20the%20Republic%3a%20An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Study%20of%20the%20Religion%20of%20the%20Romans]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clodius and the Bona Dea scandal===
The Winter rites of 62 BC were hosted by [[Pompeia (wife of Julius Caesar)|Pompeia]], wife of [[Julius Caesar]], senior magistrate in residence and [[pontifex maximus]]. [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]], a [[populares|popularist]] politician and ally of Caesar, was said to have intruded, dressed as a woman and intent on the hostess's seduction. As the rites had been [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#vitium|vitiated]], the Vestals were obliged to repeat them, and after further inquiry by the [[Roman senate|senate]] and [[pontifices]], Clodius was charged with desecration, which carried a death sentence. [[Cicero]], whose wife [[Terentia]] had hosted the previous year's rites, testified for the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., pp. 129 - 130, 296 - 7. Clodius' mere presence would have been sacrilegious: the possibility of his intrusion for sexual conquest would be an even more serious offense against Bona Dea. See also Brouwer, p.xxiii, and Herbert-Brown, p.134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar publicly distanced himself from the affair as much as possible &amp;ndash; and certainly from Pompeia, whom he divorced because "Caesar's wife must be above suspicion".&lt;ref&gt;The proverbial phrase "Caesar's wife must be above suspicion" is based on Caesar's own justification of this divorce, following the scandal. See Cicero, ''Letters to Atticus'', 1.13; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#9 9-10]; [[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/37*.html#45 37.45] and Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#6.2 6.2 and 74.2]&lt;/ref&gt; He had been correctly absent from the rites but as a [[paterfamilias]] he was responsible for their piety. As ''pontifex maximus'', he was responsible for the ritual purity and piety of public and private religion. He had the responsibility to ensure that the Vestals had acted correctly, then chair the inquiry into what were essentially his own household affairs. Worse, the place of the alleged offense was the state property lent to every pontifex maximus for his tenure of office.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert-Brown, pp. 134, 141-3.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a high profile, much commented case. The rites remained officially secret, but many details emerged during and after the trial, and remained permanently in the public domain. They fueled theological speculation, as in Plutarch and Macrobius: and they fed the prurient male imagination &amp;ndash; given their innate moral weakness, what might women do when given wine and left to their own devices? Such anxieties were nothing new, and underpinned Rome's traditional strictures against female autonomy. In the political and social turmoil of the Late Republic, Rome's misfortunes were taken as signs of divine anger against the personal ambition, religious negligence and outright impiety of her leading politicians.

Clodius' prosecution was at least partly driven by politics. In an otherwise seemingly thorough account, Cicero makes no mention of Bona Dea's May festival, and claims the goddess' cult as an aristocratic privilege from the first; the impeccably [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] Clodius, Cicero's social superior by birth, is presented as an innately impious, low-class oaf, and his popularist policies as threats to Rome's moral and religious security. After two years of legal wrangling, Clodius was acquitted &amp;ndash; which Cicero put down to jury-fixing and other backroom dealings &amp;ndash; but his reputation was damaged.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., pp. 129 - 130, 296 - 7. In 59 BC, to further his political career, which otherwise might have stalled, Clodius renounced his patrician status for a questionable adoption into a [[plebs|plebeian]] ''[[gens]]'', and was elected [[Tribune|tribune of the people]]. To his opponents, he was a dangerous social renegade; he was murdered in 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The scandalous revelations at the trial also undermined the sacred dignity and authority of the Vestals, the festival, the goddess, office of the pontifex maximus and, by association, Caesar and Rome itself. Some fifty years later, Caesar's heir Octavian, later the ''[[princeps]]'' [[Augustus]], had to deal with its repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert-Brown, pp.141 - 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial Era===
Octavian presented himself as restorer of Rome's traditional religion and social values, and as peacemaker between its hitherto warring factions.&lt;ref&gt;As a dutiful heir, he [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)#Caesar's heir|deified the dead Caesar and established his cult]], but he took pains to distance himself from Caesar's mortal aspirations, and cultivated an aura of personal modesty. His religious reforms reflect an ideology of social and political reconciliation, with a single individual (himself) as focus of empire and its final arbiter.&lt;/ref&gt; In 12 BC he became pontifex maximus, which gave him authority over Rome's religious affairs, and over the Vestals, whose presence and authority he conspicuously promoted.&lt;ref&gt;His restoration of the Vestals began even before his pontificate. On his return from the final battle of the civil war, at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]] he was greeted by a procession of women, headed by the Vestals.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Livia was a distant relative of the long-dead but still notorious Clodius;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert-Brown, p.146.&lt;/ref&gt; but also related to the unfortunate Vestal Licinia, whose attempted dedication of Bona Dea's Aventine Temple had been thwarted by the Senate. Livia restored the temple and revived its May 1 festival, perhaps drawing attention away from her disreputable kinsman and the scandalous events of 62 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Cunham, in Harriet Flower (ed), The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic, Cambridge University Press, 2004, p.155.[https://books.google.com/books?id=i1rQqJo_flwC&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=Licinia+Vestal+Bona+Dea&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h6-uUI5VU9&amp;sig=JZkwjWv5bLChMU7sPmzj3ht2o90&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lbrtTIeuD5K4hAe61pTNDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Licinia%20Vestal%20Bona%20Dea&amp;f=false googlebooks partial preview.] Livia's association with the Vestal Licinia is itself not unproblematic. Licinia was tried on an almost certainly trumped-up charge of broken chastity, acquitted, then re-tried, found guilty, and executed on the strength of two prophecies in the Sibylline books. She was a contemporary of the [[Gracchi]], and was probably a victim of the turbulent factional politics of the time. Livia's actions may also have helped to repair and elevate Licinia's posthumous reputation. Augustus is known to have called in, examined and censored many oracles, including the Sybilline books. According to Herbert-Brown, p.144, he might have removed the prophecies that had been used to condemn Licinia.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Bona Dea's December festival may have continued quietly, or could simply have lapsed, its reputation irreparably damaged. There is no evidence of its abolition. Livia's name did not and could not appear in the official religious calendars, but Ovid's Fasti associates her with May 1, and presents her as the ideal wife and "paragon of female Roman virtue".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert-Brown, p.130, citing Ovid, Fasti, 5. 148 - 158. As a non-divinity, Livia could not have appeared on the religious calendar. [[Claudius]] deified her long after her death.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Bona Dea's provincial and municipal sanctuaries were founded around this time, to propagate the new Imperial ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, pp. 237 - 238.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult centre]] in [[Aquileia]] honours an [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]] Bona Dea [[Ceres (mythology)|Cereria]], probably in connection with the [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|corn dole]].&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, p.412.&lt;/ref&gt; Other state cults to the goddess are found at [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] and [[Portus]].&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, pp.402, 407.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Vestals seldom went beyond Rome's city boundary, these cults would have been led by leading women of local elites, whether virgin or matron.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, p.571.&lt;/ref&gt;

Livia's best efforts to restore Bona Dea's reputation had only moderate success in some circles, where scurrilous and titillating stories of the goddess' rites continued to circulate. Well over a century after the Clodius scandal, Juvenal describes Bona Dea's festival as an opportunity for women of all classes, most shamefully those of the upper class &amp;ndash; and men in drag ("which altars do not have their Clodius these days?") &amp;ndash; to get drunk and cavort indiscriminately in a sexual free-for-all.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, ''Satires'', 6.316 - 344. See Brouwer, p. 269, for further commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 2nd century, an increasing religious syncretism in Rome's traditional religions presents Bona Dea as one of many aspects of [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] Caelestis, the celestial Virgin, Great Mother of the gods, whom later [[Mariology|Mariologists]] identify as prototype for the Virgin Mary in Christian theology.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Benko, ''The virgin goddess: studies in the pagan and Christian roots of mariology,'' BRILL, 2004, p.168. Other goddesses named ''Caelestis'' or ''Regina Caelestis'' (Heavenly Queen) include [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], the ''[[Magna Mater]]'' (also known as "the Syrian Goddess" and [[Cybele]]), and [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the one goddess ritually excluded from Bona Dea's rites.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian theologists present Bona Dea - or rather, Fauna, whom they clearly take her to be - as an example of the immorality and  absurdity at the heart of traditional Roman religion; according to them, she is no prophetess, merely "foolish Fenta", daughter and wife to her incestuous father, and "good" ''(bona)'' only at drinking too much wine.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius appears to draw on [[Varro]] as his source for ''Fenta Fatua''. ''Fenta'' appears to be a proper name; Fatua is translatable as "female seer" (one who foretells fate), or a divinely inspired "holy fool", either of which might carry Varro's intended meaning: but also as merely "foolish" (in Arnobius, for getting drunk in the first place, or because stupefied by drinking wine, or perhaps both). Arnobius gives two 1st century BC sources (now lost) as his authority: Sextus Clodius, and Butas. See Brouwer, pp. 233-4, 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temples==
The [[Temple of Bona Dea]] in Rome was situated on a lower slope of the northeastern [[Aventine Hill]], beneath the height known as Saxum,&lt;ref&gt;Traditionally, [[Remus]] took his auspices on the ''Saxum'', the Aventine's lesser height and probably identical with Ennius' ''Mons Murcia''.&lt;/ref&gt; southeast of the [[Circus Maximus]]. Its foundation year is unknown but the Aventine was host to several foreign or imported cults. Dumezil claims that Festus' identification of Bona Dea with Damia infers a foundation date in or shortly after 272 BC, after Rome's capture of [[Taranto|Tarentum]]. On the other hand [[Cicero]], during Clodius' trial, claimed the goddess' cult as native to Rome, coeval with its foundation. In the middle Republican era, the temple may have fallen into disrepair, or its cult into official disfavour. In 123 BC the Vestal Licinia gave the temple an [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ara|altar]], [[Aedicula|small shrine]] and couch for the goddess, but they were removed as unlawful by the [[pontifex maximus]] [[Publius Mucius Scaevola|P. Scaevola]].&lt;ref&gt;Wildfang, pp.92 - 93, citing Cicero, ''De Domo Sua'', 53.136. Licinia may have been attempting to assert the independence of her order against the dominant traditionalists in of the Senate. Scaevola removed her donations as not made "by the will of the people". Thereafter, the Temple's official status is unknown until Livia's restoration in the Augustan era.&lt;/ref&gt; Its use and status at the time of the Bona Dea scandal are unknown. It was restored in the Imperial era, once by the empress [[Livia]], wife of Augustus, and perhaps again by Hadrian.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'', 5.157 - 158, refers to the Augustan restoration. ''Historia Augusta,'' Hadrian, 19, is the sole source for a rebuilding under Hadrian: ''Fecit et... Aedem Bonae Deae''. Brouwer, p. 401, regards this as the most likely meaning, rather than a new building.&lt;/ref&gt; It survived to at least the 4th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;The temple is listed in the 4th century ''Notitia Regionis'', (Regio XII)&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known of its architecture or appearance, save that unlike most Roman temples it was walled. It was an important centre of healing; it held a store of various [[Medicine in ancient Rome#Medicines|medicinal herbs]] that could be dispensed at need by its priestesses. Harmless snakes roamed its precincts. Men were forbidden entry but could dedicate offerings to the goddess,&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Ball Platner (revised by Thomas Ashby):
A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, London: Oxford University Press, 1929, p.85.[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Bona_Dea_Subsaxana.html courtesy link to Bill Thayer's website]&lt;/ref&gt; or, according to Ovid, could enter the precincts "if bidden by the goddess".&lt;ref&gt;The meaning is uncertain: see Ovid, ''Ars Amatoria'', III, 637-638: ...''cum fuget a templis oculos Bona Diva virorum, praeterquam siquos illa venire iubet''. (...Bona Dea bars the eyes of men from her temple, except such as she bids come there herself). Cited in Brouwer, p.183. See also p. 210, citing Festus, epitome of Flaccus, De Verborum Significatu, 56: the entry of men to Bona Dea's temple is [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#religiosus|religiosus]] (contrary to the divine will and law). Presumably, men were allowed in the precincts but not the sanctuary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most provincial sanctuaries and temples to Bona Dea are too decayed, despoiled or fragmentary to offer firm evidence of structure and layout, but the remains of four are consistent with the sparse descriptions of her Aventine temple. In each, a perimeter wall surrounds a dense compound of annexes, in which some rooms show possible use as dispensaries. The layout would have allowed the concealment of inner cults or mysteries from non-initiates. There is evidence that at least some remained in use to the 4th century AD as cultic healing centres.&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, 410, 429.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dedications and iconography==
Despite the exclusively female, aristocratic connections of her winter festival at Rome and her high status as a protecting deity of the Roman state, elite dedications to Bona Dea are far outnumbered by the personal dedications of the Roman plebs, particularly the [[ingenui]]; the greatest number of all are from freedmen and slaves; and an estimated one-third of  all dedications are from men, one of whom, a provincial Greek, claims to be a priest of her cult. This is evidence of lawful variation &amp;ndash; at least in the Roman provinces &amp;ndash; from what almost all Roman literary sources present as an official and absolute rule of her cult.&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, p.258. The estimate is in Peter F. Dorcey, ''The cult of Silvanus: a study in Roman folk religion'', Columbia studies in the Classical tradition, BRILL, 1992, p.124, footnote 125. The claim to be a male priest of Bona Dea is from ''Inscriptiones Graecae'', XIV 1499.&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions of the Imperial era show her appeal as a personal or saviour-goddess, extolled as ''Augusta''  and ''Domina''; or as an all-goddess, titled as  ''Regina Triumphalis'' (Triumphal Queen), or ''Terrae marisque Dominatrici'' (Mistress of sea and land).&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, pp. 384 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Private and public dedications associate her with agricultural deities such as [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]], and the virgin goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; She is also named in some dedications of public works, such as the restoration of the Claudian Aqueduct.&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, pp.79 - 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most inscriptions to Bona Dea are simple and unadorned but some show serpents, often paired. Cumont (1932) remarks their similarity to the serpents featured in domestic shrines ([[Lares#Domestic shrines to the Lares|lararia]]) at [[Pompei]]; serpents are associated with many earth-deities, and had protective, fertilising and regenerating functions, as in the cults of [[Aesculapius]], [[Demeter]] and [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]. Some Romans kept live, harmless snakes as household pets, and credited them with similarly beneficial functions.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Cumont, "La Bona Dea et ses serpents", Mélanges d'archéologie et d'histoire, 1932, Vol. 49, Issue 49, pp.1 - 5.[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/mefr_0223-4874_1932_num_49_1_7221 link to French language article at Persée.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Images of the goddess show her enthroned, clad in [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] and mantle. On her left arm she holds a [[cornucopia]], a sign of her abundant generosity and fruitfulness. In her right hand, she holds a bowl, which feeds a serpent coiled around her right arm: a sign of her healing and regenerative powers. This combination of snake and cornucopia are unique to Bona Dea. The literary record offers at least one variation on this type; Macrobius describes her cult statue as overhung by a "spreading vine", and bearing a sceptre in her left hand.&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, p. 401: Macrobius may have been referring to her Aventine cult statue (now lost): cf. the sceptre as an attribute of Juno, and a dedication at Aquincum to ''Bonae Deae Iunoni''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
Cicero makes no reference to any myth pertaining to Bona Dea. Later Roman scholars connected her to the goddess [[Fauna (deity)|Fauna]], a central figure in [[Latium]]'s aristocratic foundation myth, which was thus re-embroidered as a Roman moral fable. Several variants are known; Fauna is daughter, wife or sister of [[Faunus]] (also named ''Faunus [[Fatuus]]'', meaning Faunus "the foolish", or seer). Faunus was son of [[Picus]], and was the first king of the Latins, empowered with the gift of prophecy. In Roman religion he was a pastoral god and protector of flocks, with a shrine and oracle on the Aventine, sometimes identified with [[Inuus]] and later, with Greek [[Pan (god)|Pan]]. As his female counterpart, Fauna had similar gifts, domains and powers in relation to women. In Plutarch's version of the myth, the mortal Fauna secretly gets drunk on wine, which is forbidden her. When Faunus finds out, he thrashes her with myrtle rods; in [[Lactantius]]'s version, Faunus thrashes her to death, regrets the deed and deifies her. Servius derives the names Faunus and Fauna, collectively the Fatui, from ''fari'' (to prophesy): they "are also called Fatui because they utter divine prophecy in a state of stupor".&lt;ref&gt;Versnel p.46, citing Plutarch, ''Roman Questions,'' 35: cf. [[Arnobius]], ''Adversus Nationes'', 5.18: [[Lactantius]] ''Divinae Institutiones'', 1.22.9 - 11: Servius, In Aeneidos, 8, 314.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Macrobius]] writes that Bona Dea is "the same as Fauna, [[Ops]] or [[Fauna (deity)|Fatua]]... It is said too that she was the daughter of Faunus, and that she resisted the amorous advances of her father who had fallen in love with her, so that he even beat her with myrtle twigs because she did not yield to his desires though she had been made drunk by him on wine. It is believed that the father changed himself into a serpent, however, and under this guise had intercourse with his daughter."&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'', 1.12.20 - 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Macrobius refers the serpent's image at the goddess' rites to this mythical transformation, and to the live, harmless serpents who roamed the goddess' temple precincts.&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, pp. 340 - 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Varro]] explains the exclusion of men from Bona Dea's cult as a consequence of her great modesty; no man but her husband had ever seen her, or heard her name. For [[Servius]], this makes her the paragon of chaste womanhood.&lt;ref&gt;Brouwer, pp.218, 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Most likely, once Fauna's mythology seemed to offer an [[Etiology|explanation]] for Bona Dea's mysterious cult, the myth developed circumstantially, to fit what little was known of the practice. In turn, the cult practice may have changed to support the virtuous ideological message required of the myths, particularly during the Augustan religious reforms that identified Bona Dea with the empress Livia.&lt;ref&gt;See Brouwer, p. xxiii, 266ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Versnel (1992) notes the elements common to the Bona Dea festival, Fauna's myths, and Greek Demeter's [[Thesmophoria]], as "wine, myrtle, serpents and female modesty blemished".&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, pp.35, 47. Thesomphoria was a three-day festival; its participants, exclusively female,  slept on "primitive" beds made of ''lugos'', a willow species known to the Romans as ''agnos'', or ''vitex agnus castis'': supposedly an infertile tree, and a strong anaphrodisiac. Though wine is not attested at Thesmophoria, it may have been used. Like the Vestals, Demeter's  priestesses were virgin.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult themes in modern scholarship==
Bona Dea's is the only known festival in which women could gather at night, drink strong, sacrificial-grade wine and perform a blood sacrifice. Although women were present at most public ceremonies and festivals, the religious authorities in Roman society were the male [[College of Pontiffs|pontiffs]] and [[augur]]s, and women could not lawfully perform rites at night, unless "offered for the people in proper form".&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Legibus'', 2.9.21.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were allowed wine at these and other religious occasions. At other times, they might drink weak, sweetened, or diluted wine in moderation but Roman traditionalists believed that  in the more distant and virtuous past, this was forbidden,&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'', 10.23.1:[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/10*.html available at Bill Thayer's website]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. His principal source for this prohibition is the 2nd century BC moralist, Cato the Elder. See also Versnel, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt; "for fear that they might lapse into some disgraceful act. For it is only a step from the intemperance of [[Liber]] pater to the forbidden things of Venus".&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximus, 2.1.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient sources infer that women were banned from offering blood-and-wine sacrifice in their own right; even banned from handling such materials; both claims are questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Prohibitions against the handling of wine and the preparation of meat by Roman women occur in Roman literature as retrospective examples of time-hallowed tradition, in which the Vestals, whose duties include the supervision of Bona Dea's rites, are the significant exception. Some modern scholarship challenges these traditional assumptions. While female drunkenness was disapproved of, so was male drunkenness, and the moderate consumption of wine by women was probably a commonplace of domestic and religious life. Lawful blood-and-wine sacrifice is indicated many female-led cults, particularly in Graeca Magna and Etruria. See Emily A. Hemelrijk, in Hekster, Schmidt-Hofner and Witschel (Eds.), ''Ritual Dynamics and Religious Change in the Roman Empire'', Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop of the International Network Impact of Empire (Heidelberg, July 5–7, 2007), Brill, 2009, pp.253 - 267.[https://books.google.com/books?id=Crzsx0aKeeYC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;dq=Cicero+2.9.21&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fg195Y2zd_&amp;sig=Cqs2zBqEMYRCoP_Uq311PUvvapo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0ijYTILMHpOBhQeTr7j0BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cicero%202.9.21&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the strong, sacrificial grade wine used in the rites to Bona Dea was normally reserved for Roman gods, and Roman men.&lt;ref&gt;Versnell, p.32: "the most surprising aspect is the nature of the drinks: during this secret, exclusively female, nocturnal festival the women were allowed to drink - at the very least to handle - wine": see Versnel, p.45 and Wildfang, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The unusual permissions implicit at these rites probably derived from the presence and religious authority of the Vestals. They were exceptional and revered persons; virgins, but not subject to their fathers' authority; and matrons, but independent of any husband. They held forms of privilege and authority otherwise associated only with Roman men, and were answerable only to the Senior Vestal and the [[Pontifex Maximus]]. Their ritual obligations and religious integrity were central to the well being of the Roman state and all its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Modern scholarship on the Vestals is summarised in Parker, pp. 563-601. See also discussion in Wildfang, pp.31 - 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The euphemistic naming of strong wine at this festival has been variously described as an actual substitution for milk and honey, relatively late in the cult's development; as a theological absurdity;&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, H.S., Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion: Transition and reversal in myth and ritual, BRILL, 1994, p.233. Brouwer (1989) regards the wine as a substitution for earlier sacrifices of milk and honey.&lt;/ref&gt; and as an ingenious justification for behaviours that would be considered unacceptable outside this specific religious sphere. Fauna's myths illustrate the potential of wine as an agent of sexual transgression; wine was thought to be an invention of Liber-Dionysus, who was present as the male principle in certain "soft fruits", including semen and grapes; and ordinary wine was produced under the divine patronage of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the goddess of love and sexual desire. Its aphrodisiac effects were well known.&lt;ref&gt;Staples, pp. 85 - 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Staples, the euphemisms are agents of transformation. The designation of wine as "milk" conceives it as an entirely female product, dissociated from the sexually and morally complex realms of Venus and Liber. Likewise, the wine jar described as a "honey jar" refers to bees, which in Roman lore are sexually abstinent, virtuous females who will desert an adulterous household.&lt;ref&gt;Staples, pp.125 - 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Myrtle, as the sign of Venus, Faunus' lust and Fauna's unjust punishment, is simply banned; or as Versnel puts it, "Wine in, Myrtle out".&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The vine-leaf bowers and the profusion of plants &amp;ndash; any and all but the forbidden myrtle &amp;ndash; transform the sophisticated, urban banqueting hall into a "primitive" dwelling, evoking the innocence of an ancestral golden age in which women rule themselves, without reference to men or Venus, drinking "milk and honey", which are "markers par excellence of utopian golden times"&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, p.45, citing Graf F., "Milch, Honig und Wein. Zum Verstindnis der Libation im Griechischen Ritual', In G. Piccaluga  (ed.), Perennitas. Studi in onore di A. Brelich, Rome, 1980, pp.209 - 21. Some myths credit Liber-Dionysus with the discovery of honey; but not its invention.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; under the divine authority of Bona Dea.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel,p. 45: "On the other hand, the mimicry may also have functioned as fuel for 'laughter of the oppressed"... "'say, dear, would you be so kind as to pass on the milk?'".&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20279">The '''Cancer Genome Anatomy Project''' ('''CGAP'''), created by the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) in 1997 and introduced by [[Al Gore]], is an online database on normal, pre-cancerous and cancerous genomes. It also provides tools for viewing and analysis of the data, allowing for identification of genes involved in various aspects of tumor progression. The goal of CGAP is to characterize cancer at a molecular level by providing a platform with readily accessible updated data and a set of tools such that researchers can easily relate their findings to existing knowledge. There is also a focus on development of software tools that improve the usage of large and complex datasets.&lt;ref name="Riggins2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riggins|first1=G.

Gerhard, and includes sub-projects or initiatives, with notable ones including the Cancer Chromosome Aberration Project (CCAP) and the Genetic Annotation Initiative (GAI). CGAP contributes to many databases and organisations such as the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] contribute to CGAP's databases.

The eventual outcomes of CGAP include establishing a correlation between a particular cancer's progression with its therapeutic outcome, improved evaluation of treatment and development of novel techniques for prevention, detection and treamtent. This is achieved by characterisation of biological tissue mRNA products.

==Research==

===Background===
The fundamental cause of cancer is the inability for a cell to regulate its gene expression. To characterise a specific type of cancer, the proteins that are produced from the altered gene expression or the mRNA precursor to the protein can be examined. CGAP works to associate a particular cell's [[expression profile]], molecular signature or [[transcriptome]], which is essentially the cell's fingerprint, with the cell's phenotype. Therefore, expression profiles exist with consideration to cancer type and stage of progression.&lt;ref name="CGAPslides"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/understandingcancer |title=Understanding Cancer |accessdate=2014-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequencing===
CGAP's initial goal was to establish a Tumor Gene Index (TGI) to store the expression profiles. This would have contributions to both new and existing databases.&lt;ref name="KrizmanWagner1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krizman|first1=David B.|last2=Wagner|first2=Lukas|last3=Lash|first3=Alex|last4=Strausberg|first4=Robert L.|last5=Emmert-Buck|first5=Michael R.|title=The Cancer Genome Anatomy Project: EST Sequencing and the Genetics of Cancer Progression|journal=Neoplasia|volume=1|issue=2|year=1999|pages=101–106|issn=1476-5586|doi=10.1038/sj.neo.7900002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contributed to two types of libraries, the dbEST and later dbSAGE. This was performed in a series of steps:&lt;ref name="CGAPslides" /&gt;

* Cell contents are washed over plates with poly T sequences. This will bind [[Polyadenylation|Poly-A tails]] that exist only on mRNA molecules, therefore selectively keeping mRNA.
* The isolated mRNA is processed into a [[cDNA]] transcript through reverse transcription and DNA polymerisation reactions. 
* The resulting double stranded DNA is then incorporated into [[E.coli]] [[plasmids]]. Each bacterium now contains one unique cDNA and is replicated to produce clones with the same genetic information. This is termed a [[cDNA library]].
* The library can then sequenced by [[high-throughput sequencing]] techniques. This can characterise both the different genes expressed by the original cell and the amount of expression of each gene.
The TGI focused on prostate, breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers at first, and CGAP extended to other cancers in its research.
Practically, issues arose which CGAP accounted for as new technologies became available.

Many cancers occur in tissues with multiple cell types. Traditional techniques took the whole tissue sample and produced bulk tissue cDNA libraries. This cellular heterogeneity made gene expression information in terms of cancer biology less accurate. An example is prostate cancer tissue where epithelial cells, which have been shown to be the only cell type give rise to cancer, only consist 10% of the cell count. This led to development of [[laser capture microdissection]] (LCM), a technique that can isolate individual cell types individual cells, which gave rise to cDNA libraries of specific cell types.&lt;ref name="KrizmanWagner1999" /&gt;

The sequencing of cDNA will produce the entire mRNA transcript that generated it. Practically, only part of the sequence is required to uniquely identify the mRNA or protein associated. The resultant part of the sequence was termed the [[expressed sequence tag]] (EST) and is always at the end of the sequence close to the poly A tail. EST data are stored in a database called dbEST. ESTs only need to be around 400 bases long, but with [[NGS sequencing]] techniques this will still produce low quality reads. Therefore, an improved method called [[serial analysis of gene expression]] (SAGE) is also used. This method identifies, for each cDNA transcript molecule produced from a cell's gene expression, regions only 10-14 bases long anywhere along the read sequence, sufficient to uniquely identify that cDNA transcript. These bases are cut out and linked together, then incorporated into bacterial plasmids as mentioned above. SAGE libraries have better read quality and generate a larger amount of data when sequenced, and since transcripts are compared in absolute rather than relative levels, SAGE has the advantage of requiring no normalisation of data via comparison with a reference.&lt;ref name="Riggins2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KrizmanWagner1999" /&gt;

==Resources==
Following sequencing and establishment of libraries, CGAP incorporates the data along with existing data sources and provides various databases and tools for analysis. A detailed description of tools and databases created or used by CGAP can be found on NCI's CGAP website. Below are some of the initiatives or research tools provided by CGAP.

===Genomic Annotation Initiative===
The goal of the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project Genome Annotation Initiative (CGAP-GAI) is to discover and catalogue [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) that correlate with cancer initiation and progression.&lt;ref name="KrizmanWagner1999" /&gt; CGAP-GAI have created a variety of tools for the discovery, analysis and display of SNPs. SNPs are valuable in cancer research as they can be used in several different genetic studies, commonly to track transmission, identify alternate forms of genes and analyze complex molecular pathways that regulate cell metabolism, growth, or differentiation.&lt;ref name="Clifford2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clifford|first1=R.|title=Expression-based Genetic/Physical Maps of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms Identified by the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project|journal=Genome Research|volume=10|issue=8|year=2000|pages=1259–1265|issn=1088-9051|doi=10.1101/gr.10.8.1259|pmc=310932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SNPs in the CGAP-GAI are either found as a result of resequencing genes of interest in different individuals or looking through existing human EST databases and making comparisons.&lt;ref name="StrausbergBuetow2000" /&gt; It examines transcripts from healthy individuals, individuals with disease, tumour tissue and cell lines from a large set of individuals; therefore the database is more likely to include rare disease mutations in addition to high frequency variants.&lt;ref name="CliffordEdmonson2004" /&gt;  A common challenge with SNP detection is differentiation between sequencing errors with actual polymorphisms. SNPs that are found undergo statistical analysis using the CGAP SNP pipeline to calculate the probability that the variant is in fact a polymorphism. High probability SNPs are validated and there are tools available that make predictions as to whether function is altered.&lt;ref name="StrausbergBuetow2000" /&gt;

To make the data easily accessible CGAP-GAI has a number of tools which can display both a sequence alignment and assembly overview with context to sequences from which they were predicted. SNPs are annotated and integrated genetic/physical maps are often determined.&lt;ref name="CliffordEdmonson2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clifford|first1=Robert J.|last2=Edmonson|first2=Michael N.|last3=Nguyen|first3=Cu|last4=Scherpbier|first4=Titia|last5=Hu|first5=Ying|last6=Buetow|first6=Kenneth H.|title=Bioinformatics Tools for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Discovery and Analysis|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1020|issue=1|year=2004|pages=101–109|issn=0077-8923|doi=10.1196/annals.1310.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer Chromosomal Aberration Project (CCAP)===
Genomic instability is a common feature of cancer; therefore understanding structural and chromosomal abnormalities can give insight into the progression of disease. The Cancer Chromosome Aberration Project (cCAP) is a CGAP supported initiative used for defining chromosome structure and to characterize rearrangements that are associated with malignant transformation.&lt;ref name="KrizmanWagner1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CCAP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/CCAP |title=The Cancer Chromosome Aberration Project (CCAP) |accessdate=2014-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It incorporates the online version of Mitelman’s database, created by Felix Mitelman, Bertil Johansson and Fredrik Mertens prior to the creation of CGAP, another compilation of known chromosomal rearrangements.
The CCAP has several goals:&lt;ref name="CCAP" /&gt;

* Integration of cytogenetic and physical maps of the human genome
* Generate a clone repository of BAC clones across the genome that are genetically and physically mapped
* Develop a platform for parallel database correlation of cancer associated aberrations (Fluorescent in-situ hybridization(FISH)-mapped BAC clone database)
* Integrating three cytogenetic analyses techniques (spectral karyotyping, comparative genome hybridization, and FISH) to refine defining nomenclature for karyotypic aberrations.

There is cytogenetic information from over 64,000 patient cases, including more than 2000 gene fusions, contained in the database.&lt;ref name="Riggins2001" /&gt;

As part of this project there is a repository of physically and cytogenetically mapped BAC clones for the human genome that are physically available through a network of distributors.&lt;ref name="Riggins2001" /&gt; The CCAP Clone maps have been mapped cytogenetically using FISH at a resolution of 1-2Mb across the human genome, and physically mapped using sequence-tagged sites (STS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/BACs |title=All About the FISH-mapped BACs |accessdate=2014-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The data for BAC clones are also available through CGAP and NCBI databases.

===Other Resources===
Listed below are some other resources available through CGAP.&lt;ref name="Riggins2001" /&gt;

====Digital Differential Display====
An early technique used by CGAP is digital differential display (DDD), which uses the [[Fisher's exact test|Fisher exact test]] to compare libraries against each other, in order to find a significant difference between populations. CGAP ensured that DDD was able to compare between all cDNA libraries in dbEST, and not just those which were generated by CGAP.&lt;ref name="KrizmanWagner1999" /&gt;

====Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC)====
The MGC provides researchers with full-length protein information from cDNA, unlike EST or SAGE databases which only provide the identifying tag. The project includes human and mouse genes, and later cow cDNAs generated by [[The Centre for Applied Genomics|Genome Canada]] were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/ |title=Mammalian Gene Collection |accessdate=2014-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====SAGEmap====
SAGEmap is the database used to store SAGE libraries. Over 3.4 million SAGE tags exist as of 2001. Tools can be used to map SAGE tags to [[UniGene]] clusters, a database that stores transcriptomes. This allows for easier identification of a SAGE tag's corresponding sequence. In addition, there are tools associated with SAGEmaps:&lt;ref name="SAGE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/SAGE |title=SAGE genie |accessdate=2014-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Digital Northern is used to measure the expression level of specific genes,&lt;ref name="Riggins2001" /&gt;
* SAGE Anatomic Viewer displays this information visually, and compares it between normal and cancerous cells,
*Ludwig Transcript (LT) Viewer shows alternative transcripts and their possible associated SAGE tags,
*mSAGE Expression Matrix (mSEM) shows gene expression levels throughout mouse development for different tissue types.

====Gene Finder====
The CGAP locates a gene or a list of genes based on specified search criteria and provides links to different NCI and NCBI databases. A gene can be searched for specifically using a unique identifier such as gene symbols and Entrez gene number as well as generally by function, tissue or keyword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Genes/GeneFinder |title=Gene Finder |accessdate=2014-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other gene tools accessible through the CGAP web interface include the Gene Ontology Browser (GO) and the Nucleotide BLAST tool.

====Gene Expression Tools====

cDNA xProfiler and cDNA Digital gene expression displayer (DGED) together are used to find statistically significant genes of interest that are differentially expressed within two pools of cDNA libraries, typically a comparison is made between normal and cancer tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Tools |title=CGAP How to: Tools |accessdate=2014-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical significance is determined by DGED using a combination of bayesian statistics and a sequence odds ratio to calculate a probability. cDNA DGED relies on the UniGene relational database while the cDNA xProfiler uses a flat file database that is not available online.&lt;ref name="MilnthorpeSoloviev2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milnthorpe|first1=Andrew T|last2=Soloviev|first2=Mikhail|title=Errors in CGAP xProfiler and cDNA DGED: the importance of library parsing and gene selection algorithms|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|volume=12|issue=1|year=2011|pages=97|issn=1471-2105|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-12-97|pmid=21496233|pmc=3094240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes and Future==
CGAP is now a centralised location for several genomics tools and genetic databases and is employed widely in cancer and molecular biology research. The databases established by CGAP continues to contribute to knowledge of cancers in terms of their pathways and progression. The transcriptome databases can also be used in non-cancer related research, as they contain information that can be used to quickly and easily identify particular sequenced genes.The data also has clinical impact, as cDNAs can be used to create microarrays for diagnosis and treatment comparison purposes. 
CGAP has been used in many studies, with examples including:&lt;ref name="Riggins2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KrizmanWagner1999" /&gt;

'''Capital punishment in Nepal''' has been abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/abolitionist-and-retentionist-countries |title=Death Penalty &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2014-03-15 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For crimes under the country's common law, capital punishment was abolished by legal reform in 1946. Full abolition by constitutional amendment came into force on 9 November 1991. 

Article 12 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal (1990) states:&lt;ref name="handsoffcain1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handsoffcain.info/bancadati/schedastato.php?idcontinente=8&amp;nome=nepal |title=HANDS OFF CAIN against death penalty in the world |publisher=Handsoffcain.info |date= |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; "No law shall be made which provides for capital punishment."

The last execution in Nepal took place in 1979.&lt;ref name="handsoffcain1"/&gt;

== Reasons for abolition ==

According to a study by [[Cornell Law School]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pathways to Abolition of Death Penalty|url=https://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/pdf/Pathways%20to%20Abolition%20Death%20Penalty%20Worldwide%202016-07%20FINAL.pdf|website=www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=10 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the key factors leading to the abolition was a 15-year period of monitored experimental abolition, which involved a moratorium on executions for common law offenses, during which crime rates remained stable, reassured the public and paved the way for abolition for ordinary crimes in 1946.

The study also notes that the transition to a multi-party constitutional monarchy, in 1990, "provided a propitious context for abolition", seen as part of a broad program of human rights reform aimed at breaking with the past.

{{Infobox organisation
| name = Centre for Workforce Intelligence

The '''Centre for Workforce Intelligence (CfWI)''' is a national [[organisation]] delivering [[workforce planning]] advice across in [[England]] and is part of [[Mouchel]] Group PLC. 

The CfWI provides an easily accessible route for health and social care planners, clinicians and commissioners seeking workforce planning and development expertise to improve health and social care services.

It supports long-term and strategic scenario planning for the whole health and social care workforce, based on [[research]], [[evidence]] and [[analysis]], in order to build strong leadership and capability in workforce planning. 

==Key strategic areas==

===Leadership===
Providing [[leadership]] within the system, helping senior [[leaders]] to drive workforce planning, strengthening the influence of workforce planners, and connecting different parts of the system.

Strengthening leadership in workforce planning: senior leaders in health and social care are driving workforce planning that is integrated with service and financial planning. Promoting long-range planning: organisations are taking a longer-term view of workforce planning.

===Intelligence===
Providing workforce [[intelligence]] to the health and social care system to inform [[decision-making|decisions]]. This intelligence spans the ‘here and now’ through thought leadership, to planning the workforce in 10 to 20 years’ time through the use of foresight techniques. Delivering robust and timely intelligence: the CfWI is one source of workforce intelligence and is cherished by those improving people’s lives in health and social care. Sharing good practice and innovation: workforce planners are accessing, using and contributing to the CfWI's growing and validated body of knowledge.

===Planning===
Providing the support, resources and best practice to improve the effectiveness of workforce [[planning]] at local, regional and national levels. Improving skills and resources: organisations have the skills and resources they need to plan and develop their workforce. Matching the workforce to patient needs: service delivery has been improved through matching the workforce to patient needs and the CfWI's customers have been supported in improving the productivity and quality of health and social care.

==History==
In 2008 the Department of Health published a review, called ''A High Quality Workforce'', looking at the future of the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] workforce in England. The review highlighted the need for better workforce planning across the [[health]] and [[social care]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_085840 |title=A High Quality Workforce: NHS Next Stage Review |publisher= Department of Health |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_085841.pdf |archivedate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government White Paper ''Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS'' published in July 2010 then suggested a role for a Centre for Workforce Intelligence which would "act as a consistent source of information and analysis, informing and informed by all levels of the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213823/dh_117794.pdf |title=Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS |publisher= Department of Health |date=July 2010 |accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Mouchel Management Consulting Limited was contracted by the [[Department of Health]] (DH) to set up and run the Centre for Workforce Intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmhealth/6/605.htm |title=House of Commons: Health Committee- First Report: Education, training and workforce planning |publisher=UK Parliament |date=15 May 2012|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
Managing director, Greg Allen, is responsible for the CfWI's overall leadership, organisation and management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfwi.org.uk/about/who-we-are/cfwi-leadership-team |title=About us: Who we are: CfWI Leadership Team |publisher=Centre for Workforce Intelligence |accessdate=10 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160218175742/http%3A//www.cfwi.org.uk/about/who%2Dwe%2Dare/cfwi%2Dleadership%2Dteam |archivedate=18 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July 2014 a decision was made for the existing governance board and advisory panel to cease, setting in motion transition arrangements with the aim of establishing a new advisory panel. 

The governance board members had included: Professor Dame [[Carol M. Black]], Roy Taylor CBE, Sir Neil McKay CBE, Margaret Goose OBE, Dr Beth McCarron-Nash, Dame Donna Kinnair, Professor Michael Pidd and Miles Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfwi.org.uk/about/who-we-are/cfwi-governance-board |title=About us: Who we are: CfWI Governance Board |publisher=Centre for Workforce Intelligence |accessdate=10 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140812024250/http://www.cfwi.org.uk/about/who-we-are/cfwi-governance-board |archivedate=12 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advisory panel members had included: Des Kelly OBE, Dean Royles, Sir Duncan Nichol CBE, Derek Marshall, Candace Imison, Professor [[Terence Stephenson]], Dr Mark Purvis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfwi.org.uk/about/who-we-are/cfwi-advisory-panel |title=About us: Who we are: CfWI Advisory Panel |publisher=Centre for Workforce Intelligence |accessdate=10 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160218175707/http%3A//www.cfwi.org.uk/about/who%2Dwe%2Dare/cfwi%2Dadvisory%2Dpanel |archivedate=18 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A new CfWI health, public health and social care advisory panel is expected to operate from autumn 2014.

'''''Chattahoochee''''' is a 1989 American drama film directed by [[Mick Jackson (director)|Mick Jackson]] and starring [[Gary Oldman]] and [[Dennis Hopper]]. The film is based on the real-life experiences of [[Chris Calhoun]], who met screenwriter James Hicks, who then wrote a script based on his internment in a Florida state mental institution. It was turned down by several major studios before being accepted by [[Hemdale Film Corporation]], a small British-owned, [[Los Angeles]]-based company that also produced ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'', ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]'', ''[[The Last Emperor]]'', and ''[[Salvador (film)|Salvador]]''.

==Plot==
Emmett Foley (Oldman) is an American hero of the [[Korean War]] who attempts to commit suicide, first [[suicide by cop|by provoking local police]] and then by shooting himself in the chest. After his recovery, he is sent to the [[Florida State Hospital]], an institution in [[Chattahoochee, Florida]], where he fights against doctors and staff who are terrorizing and torturing their patients. His efforts eventually led to sweeping reforms in the Florida mental health system.

==Cast==
* [[Gary Oldman]] as Emmett Foley
* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Walker Benson
* [[Frances McDormand]] as Mae Foley
* [[Pamela Reed]] as Earlene
* [[Ned Beatty]] as Dr. Harwood
* [[M. Emmet Walsh]] as Morris
* [[Lee Wilkof]] as Vernon
* [[Matt Craven]] as Lonny

* [[Wilbur Fitzgerald]] as Duane
* [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as Jonathan

==Basis==
The movie is based on Chris Calhoun. The main character, Emmitt Foley, is a fictional character based on Calhoun. ''Chattahoochee'' appeared in theaters nationwide May 11, 1990. ''(Theatrical Release Date: April 20, 1990)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117789853.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 Variety: Chattahoochee]&lt;/ref&gt;
This film was well-researched, and is a great resource for viewers who want to know what conditions were in state mental hospitals prior to the 1970s when radical legislative reform swept the nation.{{Citation Needed|date=May 2017}} Another famous person institutionalized at Chattahoochee was Ruby McCollum, the African-American woman who shot state senator elect, Dr. C. Leroy Adams in 1952. Her case brought many of these same practices to light. Barron Pilgrim is an extra in the movie and was on the porch with Gary Oldman in the trailer.

'''Dixi Crosby''' (February 8, 1800 – September 26, 1873) was an American surgeon and educator at [[Dartmouth College]]. He created a new technique for reducing [[metacarpophalangeal]] dislocation and was the first surgeon to open an abscess at the hip joint. Crosby was also the first surgeon in the United States to be sued for medical malpractice.

== Early life and education ==
Crosby was born February 8, 1800 at [[Sandwich, New Hampshire]], United States. His parents were Dr. Asa Crosby and Betsey (Hoit) Crosby.{{sfn|White|1907|page=97}} Just before his birth, there was concern among his parents. Asa wanted a boy and Betsey wanted a girl. It turned out the new baby was a boy and Asa, the elated father, exclaimed "Dixi" in an overjoyed voice (Latin ''Dixi'', "I told you so"). Dixi became the child's name.{{sfn|Kelly|1920|page=261}}

He received the typical education of the time when he grew up in the village where the family lived. It is not known if he was a graduate of any school. He did go into his own ventures to make money when youthful, but failed due to lack of experience in business. He then pursued his father's trade as a surgeon.{{sfn|Kelly|1920|page=262}}

== Medical career ==
Crosby was 20 when he took up the study of medicine with his father. He began practicing surgery within a year from when he seriously took up his medical training. One example of a successful surgery in his first year of practice was when he performed an amputation of a leg to save a patient. His father and other surgeons had already declared that the patient could not survive such an operation – but Crosby saved his life.{{sfn|White|1907|page=97}}

Crosby studied at [[Geisel School of Medicine|Dartmouth Medical School]] and eventually received his degree from that college in 1824. He practiced his medical profession for fourteen years in various places within the state of New Hampshire and then moved to [[Hanover, New Hampshire]]. He was promoted in 1838 to the chair of surgery at the Dartmouth Medical School, which position he held until 1841. To this position was added [[obstetrics]] and other diseases of women and children. He lectured in these fields for 27 years.{{sfn|Wilson|1900|pages=16–17}} Crosby led the successful drive to found a society supporting total abstinence from alcohol at Dartmouth in 1844.{{sfn|Squires|1956|page=310}}

Crosby created a new technique of reducing metacarpophalangeal dislocation. He was the first surgeon to open an abscess at the hip joint.{{sfn|Wilson|1900|pages=16–17}}

Crosby was the first surgeon in the United States to be sued for medical malpractice.{{efn-ua|"Dixi Crosby was also the first American surgeon to be sued for malpractice".{{sfn|Davenport|1993|page=24}}}}

== Later life and death ==
Crosby served in the [[provost marshal]]'s office by day during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and attended to his medical practice at night. The honorary doctor's degree of LL.D. was given to him by Dartmouth College in 1867. He ultimately turned over his medical lectures in 1868 to his assistant. Crosby retired in 1870 and was appointed emeritus professor of surgery. He lectured then from time to time whenever he desired.{{sfn|Wilson|1900|pages=16–17}}

Crosby died at [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], September 26, 1873.{{sfn|Kelly|1920|page=261}}

== Personal ==
Crosby was cumbersome and awkward in his walk, although a well-dressed man. He had a large head with his hair in back reaching his coat collar. Crosby had a curly shaggy reddish beard that was never combed. He kept his upper lip clean-shaven so that no hair would obstruct his lecture speaking in the medical school. He had a positive attitude that was especially apparent when he talked as he walked.{{sfn|Kelly|1920|page=261}}

Crosby married Mary Jane Moody of [[Gilmanton, New Hampshire]], in 1827. They had two sons. The first son, Albert H. Crosby (1828–1886) of [[Concord, New Hampshire]], became a medical doctor even though he initially trained as a lawyer.{{sfn|Bell|1894|page=292}} The other son, Alpheus Benning Crosby (1832–1877), became a professor of surgery at Dartmouth College.{{sfn|Conn|1906|page=388}}

'''Eggshell membrane''' or '''shell membrane''' is the clear film lining eggshells, visible when one peels a boiled [[egg]]. Chicken eggshell membranes are used as a [[dietary supplement]], having the objective of reducing or treating [[osteoarthritis]], other stiffness, and [[Arthralgia|pain of the joints]].

== Composition ==

Eggshell membrane is primarily composed of fibrous [[proteins]] such as [[collagen]] [[Type I collagen|type I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wong|first1=M.|last2=Hendrix|first2=M.J.|last3=van der Mark|first3=K.|last4=Little|first4=C.|last5=Stern|first5=R.|title=Collagen in the egg shell membranes of the hen|journal=Dev Biol|date=July 1984|volume=104|issue=1|pages=28–36|pmid=6203793|doi=10.1016/0012-1606(84)90033-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eggshell membranes also have been shown to contain [[glycosaminoglycans]], such as [[dermatan sulfate]], [[chondroitin sulfate]], and sulfated [[glycoproteins]] including [[hexosamines]], such as [[glucosamine]]. Other components identified in eggshell membranes are [[hyaluronic acid]], [[sialic acid]], [[desmosine]] [[isodesmosine]], [[ovotransferrin]], [[lysyl oxidase]], [[lysozyme]], and [[beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase|β-N-acetylglucosaminidase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruff|first1=Kevin J.|last2=DeVore|first2=Dale P.|last3=Leu|first3=Michael D.|last4=Robinson|first4=Mark A.|title=Eggshell membrane: A possible new natural therapeutic|journal=Clinical Interventions in Aging|date=2009|volume=4|pages=235–240|pmc=2697588|pmid=19554094|doi=10.2147/cia.s5797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources for dietary supplement production ==

Eggshell membrane is derived commercially from the eggshells of industrial egg processors. In the United States, egg-breaking facilities generate more than 24 billion broken eggshells every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ESM History|url=http://www.esmingredients.com/about-esm/our-history/|website=ESM Technologies|accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various ways in which the membrane of an eggshell is separated from the shell, including chemical, mechanical, steam, and vacuum processes: see [[Eggshell and protein membrane separation]]. 

It may be prepared for use as a dietary supplement. The isolated membrane is partially [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] and dried to produce a powder, that is distributed as eggshell membrane (EM) for use as a dietary supplement.

'''Eluana Englaro'''  (25 November 1970 – 9 February 2009) was an [[Italy|Italian]] woman from [[Lecco]], who entered a [[persistent vegetative state]] on 18 January 1992, following a [[car accident]], and subsequently became the focus of a court battle between supporters and opponents of [[euthanasia]]. Shortly after her accident, medical staff began feeding Englaro with a [[feeding tube]], but her father "fought to have her feeding tube removed, saying it would be a dignified end to his daughter's life. He said that before the crash his daughter visited a friend who was in a coma and told him she didn't want the same thing to happen to her if she were ever in the same state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/09/italy.euthanasia/|title=Comatose woman in euthanasia debate dies |publisher=CNN |date=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The authorities refused his request, but the decision was finally reversed in 2009, after she had spent seventeen years in the persistent vegetative state.

==Trial and ruling==
[[File:Beppino Englaro.jpg|thumb|[[Beppino Englaro]], father of Eluana]]
The case was debated in court and her father's request was denied both in December 1999 by the [[Milan]] [[Court of Appeal]] and in April 2005 by the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]]. A request for a new [[trial]] was granted by the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]] on 16 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Top_News/2007/10/16/italys_right_to_die_case_gets_new_trial/2490/ |title=Italy's 'right to die' case gets new trial |publisher=United Press International |date=2007-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019050230/http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Top_News/2007/10/16/italys_right_to_die_case_gets_new_trial/2490/ |archivedate=2007-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Milan Court of Appeal declared on 9 July 2008 that Eluana's father and legal guardian Beppino Englaro was allowed to suspend feeding and hydration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corriere.it/Media/Foto/2008/07/09/eluana_low.pdf |title=Sentenza Corte d'Appello su Eluana Englaro |publisher=Corriere|language=it}} 2008-07-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Some friends of Eluana testified that she had repeatedly stated that it would be better to die than surviving in conditions of complete unconsciousness. About a year before the accident that reduced her to a [[permanent vegetative state]], Eluana was shocked by the news that a dear friend had a motorbike accident. She admitted that she had prayed that the boy could die in peace without any further suffering. Later, she discussed this with her parents and made them promise that, should something like this happen to her, they would never allow her to survive while remaining unconscious and without free will, totally dependent on the care of others.

Nuns caring for Eluana since 1994 in [[Lecco]] were willing to continue their usual charitable treatment, and they came to the point of asking the woman's father to leave the girl to them and forget her, stating that Mr. Englaro considered his only daughter as "dead", while they considered her "alive", without referring to Eluana's convictions.
Mr. Englaro decided to move her to another hospital in order to have her feeding halted in accord with her previously expressed will. 

While some opposed the Court of Appeal's decision, some demonstrated in favour, including [[Radicali Italiani]].

In July 2008, the Italian Parliament brought a jurisdictional conflict before the Final Court of Appeal, stating that the decision was actually changing existing laws. This request was rejected by the Court.

On 13 November 2008 the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]] awarded Eluana's father the right to stop his daughter from being fed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7728284.stm |title=Italy man wins life support plea |publisher=BBC News | date=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court's decision met with immediate criticism from the Roman Catholic Church.

==Final days and death==
Beppino Englaro, as he had stated in one of his several public appearances, waited until all appeals were concluded before he suspended the feeding of his daughter. On 2 February 2009, she was moved to a private nursing home in [[Udine]], [[Friuli]], and feeding was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hrTN5x6KYdl2laMpTTGIeEKMtTxgD9641Q5G1 |title=Italian woman moved to hospital where she can die |agency=Associated Press | date=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 February 2009 Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], after declaring that Eluana looked pretty well and "could even give birth to a child," issued a decree that would have forced the continuation of the treatment of Eluana, and he thrust [[Italy]] into a constitutional crisis when President [[Giorgio Napolitano]] refused to sign the decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/08/englaro-italy-vatican |title=Italy faces constitutional crisis over coma woman |publisher=Guardian |date=2009-02-08 | location=London | first=Michael | last=Day}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Berlusconi stated that she had died at 19:35 (UTC+1) on 9 February 2009. The autopsy in the private nursing house certified that the death was caused by the withholding of nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/world/europe/10italy.html |title=Death Ends Coma Case That Set Off Furor in Italy |publisher=nytimes.com |date=2009-02-09 |first=Rachel |last=Donadio |accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also revealed that Eluana's brain had been irreparably damaged and compromised, showing [[diffuse axonal injury]]. In addition, her lungs showed signs of degeneration.{{fact|date=November 2011}}

== Opinion and reaction ==
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has been critical of the decision that led to Englaro's biological death. When the final judicial decision was handed down, [[Ennio Antonelli|Ennio Cardinal Antonelli]], president of the [[Pontifical Council for the Family]] objected to the ruling citing Eluana's humanity as cause for her to be treated with dignity and that she is not a 'vegetable'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=14369 |title=Vatican cardinal pleads for life of Italian 'Terri Schiavo' |date=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italian Prime Minister]] [[Silvio Berlusconi]] even stated that Eluana "looks fine and healthy" and "could even give birth to a child" despite the young woman being [[Tetraplegia|tetraplegic]] because of injuries sustained in the car accident.

The reaction to Englaro's death was mixed. Rome's mayor, [[Gianni Alemanno]], announced the [[Colosseum]] would be lit all night on 10 February to memorialize "a life that could have and should have been saved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article5697099.ece |title='Right to die' coma woman Eluana Englaro dies |publisher=timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] said that "mercy delayed is mercy denied" and expressed his regret that Englaro's family had to wait seventeen years to effectuate her wishes. However, the conservative bioethicist [[Wesley J. Smith]] has leveled criticism at the decision to withdraw hydration, stating that the supporters of such a decision portray a false perception that withdrawal of hydration has "benign" consequences for the victim, which he argues is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyjsmith.com/blog/2009/02/eluana-englaro-dehydration-begins.html |title=Eluana Englaro: Dehydration Begins |publisher=Wesleyjsmith.com |date=2009-02-07 |accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness''''' is a documentary/art film released in June 2015 that takes audiences through farms and urban landscapes in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]], interviewing leading practitioners in the [[Natural farming|Natural Farming]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hong|first=Ryoseok|title=Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness|date=2000-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3709036/|last2=Kawaguchi|last3=Korn|first2=Yoshikazu|first3=Larry|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film began when an environmental artist (Patrick M. Lydon) and an environmental book editor (Suhee Kang), had a chance meeting in Seoul, South Korea, and began conducting short interviews together with leaders in the ecology and social justice movements. Upon meeting Korean farmer Seong Hyun Choi however, the two were so impressed by his ecological mindset and way of working, that they set out to produce a feature film about the movement. Lydon and Kang ended up quitting their jobs, giving away most of their possessions, and becoming voluntarily homeless for four years in order to afford producing the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kimchiandbasil.com/interview-final-straw/|title=Final straw: food, earth, happiness - Kimchi&amp;Basil|date=2016-02-20|work=Kimchi&amp;Basil|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/a-root-solution/|title=A ‘Root’ Solution {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/21/lydon-ghost-ship-raises-broad-questions-about-art-and-culture/|title=Lydon: Ghost Ship raises big questions about arts and culture|last=|first=|date=|website=San Jose Mercury News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is split into three sections 1) Modern Life, 2) Foundations and Mindset of Natural Farming, and 3) Natural Farming in Practice and Life. According to the filmmakers, as they began to understand more about how natural farming itself was not rooted in methods, but in a way of thinking, they chose to explore the life philosophies and ways of thinking of natural farming practitioners in a more free-flowing and artistic way, rather than an instructive one; the result is an unconventional documentary that features slow paced musical interludes alongside interviews. Reviewers have called both "meditative, and mindful," and "an inspiring call to action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mindfulpie.com/one-straw-revolution/|title=Love nature, eat well – Mindful Pie|website=mindfulpie.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/|title=Eco Farming|last=|first=|date=July 1, 2015|work=Clean Eating Magazine|access-date=August 1, 2015|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=Active Interest Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and musician [[Alicia Bay Laurel]] called the film "both art and documentary".

== Production ==
Lydon and Kang spent what they call a "meager" life savings to make the film, along with the volunteer efforts of farmers, translators, writers, musicians they had met during their journey. Although the film was filmed, written, and edited entirely by the two directors, they readily admit that the process of making the film was co-operative effort, with more than 200 volunteers directly involved in the process in some way. The soundtrack was recorded with professional musicians from each of the three countries where filming took place, all of whom donated their time to contribute to the film project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the continued help of international volunteers, the film is available in four languages (English, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese), and three more (Chinese, Portuguese, French) are in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cbjournalism.com/2016/03/24/filmmaker-spotlight-patrick-lydon-suhee-king/|title=Filmmaker Spotlight: Patrick Lydon &amp; Suhee King|date=2016-03-24|website=Chelsea Breaks the News|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/the-documentary/|title=The Documentary {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tour and critical reception ==

Frustrated by the lack of distribution and film festival options for low- and no-budget films, the filmmakers made the decision to manage distribution and touring in the same way they went about filming, through co-operative effort. With the help of volunteers, independent theater owners, and community organizers, they launched an extensive tour throughout Japan and South Korea from 2015-2016, eventually screening the film at over 130 venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/tour-dates-and-screenings/|title=Tour Dates and Screenings {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than simply screening the film, the filmmakers decided to transition their existing media production organization ''SocieCity,'' into a vehicle for art and community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artseverywhere.ca/2016/03/07/social-practice-artwork-a-restaurant-and-garden-serving-up-connections-to-urban-nature/|title=Social Practice Artwork: A Restaurant and Garden Serving up Connections to Urban Nature|last=|first=|date=|website=artseverywhere.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made a point of hosting interactive events along with their screenings and in several cases, stayed in communities for up to three months at a time to build natural gardens and host a project they call REALtimeFOOD, a grown-to-order restaurant which connects the ideas from the film with real-world practices in farming, food, and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/barndining_/220514125842|title=Bar&amp;Dining Magazine : 네이버 블로그|website=blog.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://setouchiexplorer.com/real-time-food-project-day-one-worlds-slowest-restaurant-opening/|title=REAL time FOOD Project - Day One - World's Slowest Restaurant Opening|date=2016-09-18|work=Setouchi Explorer|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, these efforts were funded by grants from local philanthropic organizations and/or supported by the communities themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chishimatochi.info/found/index.php/archives/service/1961|title=おおさか創造千島財団  » 2015年度|website=www.chishimatochi.info|language=ja|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainablepractice.org/2013/11/15/final-straw/|title=Final Straw|date=2013-11-15|website=The CSPA|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interested in the unconventional way the film was being made and toured, multiple magazines and newspapers in Japan and Korea followed the directors during several parts of their journey, notably ESSEN, Bar and Dining, and Road magazines, and Shikoku Shinbun and Huffington Post newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shikoku-newspaper-english.pdf|title=Connecting to Life with Natural Farming in Megijima|last=|first=|date=September 18, 2016|work=Shikoku Shinbun|access-date=17 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.kr/salimstory/story_b_8476176.html|title="모든 것이 연결되어 있다는 깨달음이 시작"|website=허핑턴포스트|language=ko-KR|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://navercast.naver.com/magazine_contents.nhn?rid=1095&amp;contents_id=45426|title=내일의 식문화를 일구는 사람들이 보내 온 새해 편지|access-date=2017-04-18|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the tour, the film was eventually picked up by festivals including Tassie Eco Film Festival and Belleville Doc Fest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://downtowndocfest.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Belleville%20Downtown%20DocFest%20Program_2016.pdf|title=Belleville International Documentary Festival - Official Program|last=|first=|date=1 February 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fireworks policy in the United States''' can be different in each jurisdiction. 

== Classifications ==
The United States government has classified fireworks and similar devices according to their potential hazards.

[[File:San Diego Fireworks.jpg|thumb|Independence Day fireworks in [[San Diego, California]]]]

=== Current explosives classes ===
The U.S. government now uses the [[United Nations explosives shipping classification system]], which is based on hazard in shipping only, while the old US system also covered use hazards. The BATFE and most states performed a direct substitution of '''Shipping Class 1.3''' for '''Class B''', and '''Shipping Class 1.4''' for '''Class C'''. This allows some hazardous items that would have previously been classified as '''Class B''' and regulated to be classified as '''Shipping Class 1.4''' due to some packaging method that confines any explosion to the package. Being '''Shipping Class 1.4''', they can now be sold to the general public and are unregulated by the BATF.

A code number and suffix (such as '''1.3G''') is not enough to fully describe a material and how it is regulated, especially in '''Shipping Class 1.4G'''. It also must have a '''UN Number''' that exactly describes the material. For example, common consumer fireworks are '''UN0336''', or '''Shipping Class 1.4G UN0336'''.

Here are some ''common'' fireworks classes:
* '''Class 1.1G''' (Mass Explosion Possible:Pyrotechnics) '''UN0094''' Flashpowder
* '''Class 1.1G''' (Mass Explosion Possible:Pyrotechnics) '''UN0333''' Fireworks (Salutes in bulk or in manufacture)
* '''Class 1.2G''' (Projection but not mass explosion:Pyrotechnics) '''UN0334''' Fireworks (Rarely used)
* '''Class 1.3G''' (Fire, Minor Blast:Pyrotechnics) '''UN0335''' Fireworks (Most Display Fireworks) Current federal law states that without appropriate ATF license/permit, the possession or sale of any display/professional fireworks is a felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison.
** Any ground [[Salute (pyrotechnics)|salute]] device with over 50 milligrams of explosive composition
** Torpedoes (except for railroad signaling use)
** Multi-tube devices containing over 500&amp;nbsp;grams of pyrotechnic composition and without 1/2" space between each tube
** Any multiple tube fountains with over 500&amp;nbsp;grams of pyrotechnic composition and without 1/2" space between each tube
** Any reloadable aerial shells over 1.75" diameter
** Display shells
** Any single-shot or reloadable aerial shell/mine/comet/tube with over 60&amp;nbsp;grams of pyrotechnic composition
** Any Roman candle or rocket with over 20&amp;nbsp;grams of pyrotechnic composition
** Any aerial salute with over 130 milligrams of explosive composition
* '''Class 1.4G ''' (Minor Explosion Hazard Confined To Package:Pyrotechnics) '''UN0336''' Fireworks (Consumer or Common Fireworks) Most popular consumer fireworks sold in the US.
** Reloadable aerial shells 1.75" or less sold in a box with not more than 12 shells and one launching tube
** Single-shot aerial tubes
** [[Bottle rocket]]s
** [[Skyrocket]]s and missiles
** Ground spinners, pinwheels and helicopters
** [[flare (pyrotechnic)|Flare]]s &amp; fountains
** [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman candle]]s
** Smoke and novelty items
** Multi-shot aerial devices, or "[[Cake (firework)|cakes]]"
** [[Firecracker]] packs. Although some firecracker items may be called "[[M-80 (explosive)|M-80's]]", "[[M-1000|M-1000's]]", "[[Cherry bomb]]s" or "[[Silver Salutes]]" by the manufacturer, they must contain less than 50 milligrams of flash or other explosive powder in order to be legally sold to consumers in the United States.
** [[Sparkler]]s
** [[Catherine wheel (firework)|Catherine wheel]]
** [[Black snake (firework)|black snake]]s and strobes
** Mines
* '''Class 1.4S ''' (Minor Explosion Hazard Confined To Package: Packed As To Not Hinder Nearby Firefighters) '''UN0336''' Fireworks (Consumer or Common Fireworks)
* '''Class 1.4G ''' (Minor Explosion Hazard Confined To Package:Pyrotechnics) '''UN0431''' ARTICLES, PYROTECHNIC for technical purposes (Proximate Pyrotechnics)
* '''Class 1.4S ''' (Minor Explosion Hazard Confined To Package: Packed As To Not Hinder Nearby Firefighters) '''UN0432''' ARTICLES, PYROTECHNIC for technical purposes (Proximate Pyrotechnics)

Fireworks tubes are made by rolling thick paper tightly around a former, such as a dowel. They can be made by hand, most firework factories use machinery to manufacture tubes. Whenever tubes are used in fireworks, at least one end is always plugged with clay to keep both chemicals and burning gases from escaping through that end. The tooling is always made of non-sparking materials such as aluminium or brass. Experts at handling explosives, called pyrotechnicians, add chemicals for special effects.

=== Previous US DOT explosives classifications ===
Explosives, including fireworks, were previously divided into three classifications for transportation purposes by the [[US Department of Transportation]] (DOT).

* '''Class A''' explosives included [[high explosive]]s such as [[dynamite]], [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], [[blasting cap]]s, packages of [[flash powder]], bulk packages of [[black powder]] and blasting agents such as [[ANFO]] and other slurry types of explosives.
* '''Class B''' explosives included [[low explosive]]s such as "display fireworks" which were the larger and more powerful fireworks used at most public displays.
* '''Class C''' explosives included other [[low explosive]]s such as igniters, fuses and "common fireworks", which were the smaller and less powerful fireworks available for sale to and use by the general public.

At the time most purchases and use of all of these explosives, with specific exceptions for high explosives purchased and used in state, black powder used for sporting purposes and common fireworks, required a license or permit to purchase and use from the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (ATF or BATFE), or the state, or a local authority.

== Consumer fireworks safety ==
[[File:StaffordWelcomeFireworksillegal.JPG|thumb|Consumer fireworks are illegal in [[Stafford, Texas|Stafford]], [[Texas]].]]
[[File:Small Consumer Firework.JPG|thumb|right|An example of a consumer firework in [[California]]]]
[[File:Paravur Puttingal Fireworks.jpg|right|thumb|A scene from [[Paravur, Kollam|Paravur]] [[Puttingal Temple]]'s ([[India]]) Fireworks Competition. A major mishap happened here in [[Puttingal temple fire|April 2016]], caused 110 deaths.]]

Availability and use of consumer fireworks are hotly debated topics. Critics and safety advocates point to the numerous injuries and accidental fires that are attributed to fireworks as justification for banning or at least severely restricting access to fireworks. Complaints about excessive noise created by fireworks and the large amounts of debris and fallout left over after shooting are also used to support this position. There are numerous incidents of consumer fireworks being used in a manner that is supposedly disrespectful of the communities and neighborhoods where the users live.

Meanwhile, those who support more liberal firework laws look at the same statistics as the critics and conclude that, when used properly, consumer fireworks are a safer form of recreation than riding bicycles or playing soccer.&lt;ref&gt;"Fireworks: safer than candles, tableware." Dave Stoddard, ''Sacramento Ledger Dispatch'', July 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] has guidelines concerning the standard of consumer fireworks sold in the US. Together with US Customs, they are very proactive in enforcing these rules, intercepting imported fireworks that don't comply and issuing recalls on unacceptable consumer fireworks that are found to have "slipped through". [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF) is the federal agency that regulates explosives, including Display Fireworks in the US.

Many states have laws which further restrict access to and use of consumer fireworks, and some of these states such as New Jersey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strausnews.com/articles/2007/07/15/advertiser_news/news/27.txt Strausnews.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523182749/http://www.strausnews.com/articles/2007/07/15/advertiser_news/news/27.txt |date=2012-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; vigorously enforce them. Each year, there are many raids on individuals suspected of illegally possessing fireworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nj.com/gloucester/2007/07/new_jersey_confiscates_4_tons.html|title=New Jersey confiscates 4 tons of Pennsylvania-bought fireworks|work=NJ.com|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF) as well as the U.S. [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) have [[general jurisdiction]] over what types of fireworks may be legally sold in the United States. The federal law is only the minimum standard however, and each state is free to enact laws that are more stringent if they so choose. Citing concerns over fireworks safety, some states, such as California, have enacted legislation restricting fireworks usage to devices that do not leave the ground, such as fountains.  North Carolina limits fireworks to a charge of 200&amp;nbsp;grams of black powder. States such as Massachusetts ban all consumer fireworks completely. Rhode Island, Arizona, New York, New Jersey, and Delaware have recently passed bills legalizing certain types of small fireworks. Vermont only allows sparklers. On the other hand, states such as Maine South Dakota, South Carolina and Tennessee allow most or all legal consumer fireworks to be sold and used throughout the year. New Mexico in some cases, will not allow fireworks from individual residents if the fireworks are said to detonate over {{convert|5|ft|m}} in height.

[[Illinois]] only permits sparklers, snake/glow worm pellets, smoke devices, trick noisemakers, and plastic or paper caps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1635&amp;ChapAct=425%26nbsp%3BILCS%26nbsp%3B35%2F&amp;ChapterID=38&amp;ChapterName=FIRE+SAFETY&amp;ActName=Fireworks+Use+Act%2E 425 ILCS 35/ Fireworks Use Act&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many users travel to neighboring states such as Indiana, Missouri, Kentucky, and Wisconsin to obtain fireworks for use in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://daily-journal.com/archives/dj/display.php?id=423245 |title=e-Editions |publisher=Daily-journal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation is similar to the plight of many [[St. Louis]] residents as fireworks are illegal within both city and [[St. Louis County, Missouri|county]] limits. However, fireworks are readily available in nearby [[St. Charles County, Missouri|St. Charles County]].

Differences in legislation among states have led to many fireworks suppliers setting up shop along state borders, to sell to customers from neighboring states where fireworks are restricted. Some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes on reservation lands sell fireworks that are not legal for sale outside the reservation.

The type of fireworks sold in the United States range from those permitted under federal law to illegal explosive devices and professional fireworks sold on the black market. Both the illicit manufacture and diversion of illegal explosives to the consumer market have become a growing problem in recent years.

== Display fireworks safety ==
Federal, state, and local authorities govern the use of display fireworks in the United States. At the federal level, the [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA) sets forth a set of codes which give the minimum standards of display fireworks use and safety in the US. Both state and local jurisdictions can further add restrictions on the use and safety requirements of display fireworks. Typically, these jurisdictions will require a licensed operator to discharge the show. Although requirements vary from state to state, licensed operators and their crew are typically required to have hours of extensive training in the [http://www.pyroinnovations.com/fireworkstraining.html Safe use of display fireworks.]

These codes can include, but are not limited to, distance from the audience, maximum size shell, firing location requirements, electrical firing system requirements, and the minimum safety gear to be worn by the fireworks crew. These guidelines are explained in the NFPA 1123&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes/AboutTheCodes.asp?DocNum=1123|title=NFPA 1123: Code for Fireworks Display|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; fireworks code.

'''Gabriela Laperrière de Coni''' (1866 – 8 January 1907&lt;ref name=Press&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.argenpress.info/2012/01/gabriela-laperriere-y-su-trabajo-social.html|title= Gabriela Laperrière and Social work|date=10 January 2012|accessdate=28 April 2013|publisher= argenpress.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an Argentine journalist, socialist, and public health activist. She founded the Feminist Socialist Center of the [[Argentine Socialist Party]], and served on the executive committee of the party, the first woman to do so.&lt;ref name="EncWomSocRef2001"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Women Social Reformers: A-L-v. 2.

==Early life==
She was born in [[Bordeaux]], France in 1866.&lt;ref name="EncWomSocRef2001"/&gt; No further information is available about her early life, except that she wrote a novel on "woman's efforts to help sick children."&lt;ref name=Coni&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3078901657/coni-gabriela-laperrire-de.html|title= Coni, Gabriela Laperrière de (1866–1907)|accessdate=28 April 2013|publisher= Encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 18, she married Dr. Emilio R. Coni, noted public-health physician from [[Buenos Aires]] who was actively engaged in immigration and health issues. She migrated to Argentina with him. His activity complimented her deep interests in the healthcare of women.&lt;ref name=Coni/&gt;

==Career==
In the initial years, Gabriella was constantly exposed to a stream of visitors seeking help from Emilio, the Director of Public Assistance in Buenos Aires, all related to the health, accommodation, living conditions, destitute children and unemployment among both men and women. Unable to cope with the situation, the couple moved to Paris. In 1895 they returned to Argentina but her husband Emilio was laid for months due to a paralytic stroke. She then attended to the duties of her husband and helped people who came seeking their assistance. In 1901, the city government of Buenos Aires permitted Gabriella to study and report on the working conditions of women and children. During this assignment she toured the neighborhood extensively and was appalled by the inhumane living conditions, lack of hygiene, food and health facilities, poor nutrition, people living in abject poverty, lack of electricity and many more miseries.&lt;ref name=Press/&gt;

After this assessment, she launched on many rehabilitation programmes such as providing food rations, set [[day care|crèches]] at workplaces so that women workers could [[breastfeeding|breastfeed]] their babies, and improved access to urban services and housing. She visited factories and reported on the harsh attitude of its owners in treating their employees which received public attention through her writings in newspapers. She made a four-part report of her findings and also mooted a proposal to enact labor laws which would bring about protection of women and children. This bill was enacted by the Parliament after her death in 1907.&lt;ref name=Press/&gt;

The '''Goleta postal facility shootings''' were a [[spree killing]] by Jennifer San Marco (December 6, 1961 – January 30, 2006), a former [[United States Postal Service|US Postal Service]] employee who shot and killed seven people in [[Goleta, California]], on January 30, 2006, before taking her own life.

== Spree shooting ==
On January 30, 2006, San Marco shot and killed her one-time neighbor, Beverly Graham, and then drove to the mail processing plant where she previously worked in [[Goleta, California]]. San Marco entered the sprawling plant by driving through a gate behind another car. She gained entry to the building by taking an employee's identification badge at gunpoint in order to gain an electronic access to the secure staff entrance. She then told the employee to leave the premises.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

In the parking lot, San Marco shot Ze Fairchild, 37, in the head with a [[handgun]]. She turned to Maleka Higgins and shot her at point-blank range. She then shot Nicola Grant. Some workers, after hearing gunshots, went to the windows to see what was happening. San Marco turned to them and smiled.

San Marco entered the building, which had around 80 employees, and continued firing. Walking into the complex, she shot supervisor Charlotte Colton. Colton was dragged into a room by a coworker.  Colton died in Cottage Hospital 2 days later. San Marco approached her old work station, encountering Lupe Swartz, who saw her coming. San Marco rapidly fired four shots into Swartz, killing her. Dexter Shannon, an Air Force veteran of the [[Vietnam War]] with grandchildren, was working with headphones on, therefore he didn't hear San Marco coming or the gunshots. He was fatally shot at point-blank range. San Marco then committed suicide by shooting herself in the head.

San Marco apparently believed that she was the target of a conspiracy centered at the [[Goleta, California|Goleta]] postal facility, according to writings recovered from her house in [[New Mexico]]. A spokesman for the [[Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office]] speculated that San Marco's [[paranoia]] and history of [[mental illness]] may have motivated her to commit the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Postal killer believed she was target of a plot |newspaper=Associated Press |date=3 February 2006 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11167920/ |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

San Marco had previously worked as a dispatcher for the Santa Barbara Police Department in the mid-1990s, a job for which she underwent a background check and psychological evaluation. She left the job after several months, which was not unusual for the high-stress occupation.&lt;ref name="bizarre"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/02/02/national/main1272077.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Postal Shooter's Bizarre Behavior | date=February 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; San Marco eventually went to work for the postal service as a clerk, but left on psychological disability following a 2003 incident in which she had to be removed from her workplace by police.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-01-31-postal-shooting_x.htm|title= Woman kills 5, self at postal plant | work=USA Today | first1=Martin | last1=Kasindorf | date=February 1, 2006 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; San Marco subsequently moved to [[Grants, New Mexico]], sometime in 2004.

In July 2004, she was denied a business license to begin publishing a periodical which would have been known as ''The Racist Press''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frosch|first1=Dan|title=Woman in California Postal Shootings Had History of Bizarre Behavior|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/03/us/woman-in-california-postal-shootings-had-history-of-bizarre-behavior.html|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gracie''''' is a 2007 American [[Sports film|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Davis Guggenheim]]. It stars [[Carly Schroeder]] as Gracie Bowen, [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Bryan Bowen, [[Elisabeth Shue]] as Lindsay Bowen, [[Jesse Lee Soffer]] as Johnny Bowen, and [[Andrew Shue]] as Coach Owen Clark.&lt;ref name="Gracie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/647371/Gracie/full-credits.html|title=Gracie|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gracie'' takes place in [[New Jersey]], United States in 1978, before 1972's [[Title IX]] had taken much effect in women's college sports&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/27artsnj.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title=A Star's (Pre-Celebrity) Turn on the Soccer Field |last=Cahillane|first=Kevin|date=May 27, 2007|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when organized [[women's soccer]] was still very rare in the United States. Gracie, the film's central [[protagonist]], overcomes the loss of her brother by convincing her family and school to allow her to play [[Football (soccer)|varsity soccer]] on an all-boys team. The story is partially based on the childhood experiences of [[Elisabeth Shue]], who was one of the producers in addition to being the wife of Davis Guggenheim, the director, as well as a cast member.

The novelization of ''Gracie'', written by [[Suzanne Weyn]], was released in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gracie-Medallion-Editions-Young-Readers/dp/1557047790|title=Gracie|first=Suzanne|last=Weyn|authorlink=Suzanne Weyn|publisher=[[William Morrow and Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=2007|edition=1st|series=Medallion Editions for Young Readers|isbn=978-1557047793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the year 1978, Gracie Bowen, a 15-year-old [[tomboy]] who lives in [[South Orange, New Jersey]], is crazy about [[soccer]], as are her three brothers and their former soccer star father. Although Gracie wants to join her brothers and neighbor Kyle in the nightly practices her father runs, she is discouraged by everyone except her older brother, Johnny.

Johnny, Gracie and Kyle attend [[Columbia High School (New Jersey)|Columbia High School]], where Johnny is the captain and star player for the varsity soccer team. After missing a shot at the end of a game, the despondent Johnny drives off with a friend's car and dies in a traffic accident.

Struggling with grief, Gracie decides that she wants to replace her brother on the team. Her father does not believe that girls should play soccer, telling her she is neither tough nor talented enough. Her mother is a [[nurse]] who lacks the competitive drive of the rest of her family and fears for Gracie's safety. Her mother later tells Gracie that she would have liked to become a [[surgeon]], but that option had not been available to her as a woman.

Rejected and depressed, Gracie begins to rebel; she stops doing her schoolwork, is caught cheating on an exam, and experiments with wild and self-destructive behavior. She is finally caught by her father almost having sex with a guy she met near the docks after telling her friend, "I want to do something that I've never done before." This serves as a wake-up call for her parents, particularly her father. He quits his job to work with her on her soccer training.

When the school board rejects her request to play boys' soccer, Gracie files an appeal. Citing the newly passed [[Title IX]], Gracie argues that since a girls' soccer team does not exist, she should be allowed to play on the boys' varsity soccer team. The school board allows her to try out for the team. After a very rough tryout, she makes the [[junior varsity]] team and has to decide if she is willing to settle for playing at that level. She decides to make the most of playing on junior varsity.

One of the coaches asks her to come up to the main team for their championship game. After saying no at first she finally goes. Gracie watches from the bench as the game goes to [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death overtime]]. New captain Kyle gets hurt and Gracie goes in for him, scoring the winning goal with a move that her dad taught her.

==Historical background==
The premise of the film rests upon the conflicting expectations of two different [[United States|American]] generations. As Gracie's parents were most likely both products of what is now referred to as the "[[Silent Generation]]" of children born during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], they would have been raised to adhere to traditional [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name="beliefnet.com"&gt;[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/219/story_21934.html 'Trying to Live a Passionate Life': Interview with Andrew Shue]&lt;/ref&gt; This would have included discouraging a girl from participating in "boys' sports" such as soccer, as opposed to "girls' sports" such as [[cheerleading]] or [[gymnastics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3702/is_200610/ai_n17193792 Girlie Girls and Manly Men: Children's Stigma Consciousness of Gender in Sports and Physical Activities]&lt;/ref&gt; Gracie, on the other hand, came of age during the 1970s, when [[second-wave feminism|new and controversial ideas about gender]] were being introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/cgi-bin/iowa/issues/business/article.html?record=882 The Future of Women's Sport and Fitness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012110003/http://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/cgi-bin/iowa/issues/business/article.html?record=882 |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, critic for the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]],'' noted an additional generation gap between those in the film and those in the audience, many of whom grew up with the [[United States women's national soccer team]] (which played its first game in 1985) as a reality:

{{quote|text=Not so long ago – 1978, actually – girls were not treated equally with boys when it came to school sports ... what happens in ''Gracie'' must seem like a tale from the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] to today's young athletes, something akin to [[Saint George and the Dragon|slaying a dragon]] or [[Snow White|housekeeping for seven dwarfs]]. But think of it this way: In 1978, future gold medalist and [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|World Cup]] star [[Mia Hamm]] was only 6 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessatlanta.com/movies/movies/etc/getCriticReview.jspd?criticReviewId=3781 Formula, but not formulaic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014102149/http://www.accessatlanta.com/movies/movies/etc/getCriticReview.jspd?criticReviewId=3781 |date=2007-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:FIFA Women's World Cup 2003 - USA vs Canada.jpg|left|thumb|275px|[[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup]]]]
Other critics have also noted the multiple generation gaps. Kevin Cahillane observes in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that, "this being 1978 (before [[Title IX]] turned a generation of girls from onlookers into athletes), her desire goes against the wishes of the coach, the principal, the other players and her heartbroken parents."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; In another article for the ''New York Times,'' Jeannette Catsoulis further argues that, "[Gracie] is accustomed to having her abilities overlooked ... When tragedy strikes, and Grace channels her grief into a resolution to play on the all-male varsity team, even her best friend is horrified. As everyone knows, only lesbians play soccer."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/movies/01grac.html?ex=1338350400&amp;en=23df6b0a612f84a8&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss Soccer Dreams and Family Tensions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film closes with the following remarks: "Thanks to [[Title IX]] and brave girls like Gracie, there are over 5&amp;nbsp;million girls who play soccer in America. Since 1991 the [[United States women's national soccer team|U.S. Women's National team]] has won Soccer's World Championships two times." (FIFA Women's World Cup Champions 1991, 1999)

==Production==

===Development and casting===
[[File:LisaShueJI1.jpg|right|thumb|225px|[[Elisabeth Shue]] in August 2007.]]
The film is loosely based on life events concerning the Shue family. Former ''[[Melrose Place]]'' star [[Andrew Shue]], who developed the film, was one of its producers, and acted a supporting role in the film, initially conceived of it as a story about his late brother William, the oldest Shue sibling, who was the captain of the [[Columbia High School (New Jersey)|Columbia High School]] soccer team that won the [[New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association|New Jersey state championship]] in 1978; he had died in an accident in 1988.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; As Andrew developed the idea with his brother-in-law [[Davis Guggenheim]], the director of ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]],'' the storyline began to shift towards Guggenheim's wife, [[Elisabeth Shue]], Andrew's older sister. She became the model for Gracie, and William became the model for Johnny. As Andrew Shue noted in an interview:

{{quote|... It was going to be about my older brother, originally. It was really Davis, my sister's husband, who pointed out to me that my sister was the real underdog in our family. I didn't know the emotional turmoil of a girl in an all-boys family trying to get some credit for the fact that she had this courage to play with boys. She has gone from being a girl who was scared, to being this brave girl who could stand up and play with boys, and [went] into acting before any of us and inspired all of us in many ways. So I wanted to celebrate her and her journey.&lt;ref name="beliefnet.com"/&gt;}}

This refers to Elisabeth Shue's own decision in 1972, at the age of nine, to play soccer on an all-boys team, making her the first girl in the South Orange and Maplewood areas of [[New Jersey]] to do so.&lt;ref name="popmatters.com"&gt;[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/news/article/41996/based-on-a-real-story-gracie-is-a-shue-thing Based on a real story, 'Gracie' is a Shue thing]&lt;/ref&gt; Shue explained her reason for doing so in a 2007 interview. "There was no other choice back then," she pointed out to the interviewer. "There was no girls team to play on."&lt;ref name="popmatters.com"/&gt; Shue continued to play on the team until 1976, when she turned 13. Of her decision to leave the team, Shue stated, "the movie is really what would have happened if I hadn't quit [playing soccer]. I quit because of what people would think of me. The pressure from the boys. The awkward development of my body. I really, really regret it. I wish I'd been brave enough."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

Andrew, Elizabeth, their brother John (who was also a producer on the film), and Guggenheim then engaged in an extensive search to find the right actress for the role of fifteen-year-old Gracie; they promoted the search on the website ''findinggracie.com.''&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*//findinggracie.com/ |date=* |title=archived versions from 2004-2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1044463,00.html Shue Business], an April 2005 article from the ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' website&lt;/ref&gt; The role eventually went to athlete-actress [[Carly Schroeder]]. Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat argue that Schroeder "puts in a stellar performance as the teenager who becomes a warrior when most of her peers are cheering from the sidelines."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/films/films.php?id=16912 Gracie: A film review]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Andrew Shue (1993).jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Andrew Shue]] in February 2006]]

Filming took partial place at [[Columbia High School (New Jersey)|Columbia High School]], both the setting of the events of the film and the actual high school the Shue family members had attended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbiasoccer.net/ Columbia High Soccer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110185835/http://www.columbiasoccer.net/ |date=2007-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming also took place in various locations in [[South Plainfield, New Jersey]].

Andrew Shue chose to honor his former Dartmouth and Columbia High School teammate Chris Colasanti by naming the story's coach after him. Colasanti, who had been the captain of Columbia's 1985 state championship team, was killed in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attack]] on the World Trade Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://njmonthly.com/articles/best-of-jersey/the_will_to_win/#]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Reviews===
''[[At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper]]'' gave ''Gracie'' "Two [[Thumbs signal|Thumbs up]]", stating, "You've seen it before, but you'll rarely see it better."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=6&amp;subsec=Gracie Ebert and Roeper review]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gracie'' is a ''[[New York Times]] Critics' Pick.'' Times critic Jeannette Catsoulis described ''Gracie'' as "a familiar underdog story told with unusual sensitivity ... ''Gracie'' connects the adversity-drama dots – the beat-down, the bounce-back, the last-minute support from an unexpected quarter – with a subtle awareness of the shock waves of bereavement. Balancing the emotional complexity is Chris Manley's refreshingly unaffected cinematography; the drama of a free kick, like that of a good movie, is best viewed through a steady lens."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/movies/01grac.html Soccer Dreams and Family Tensions]&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Zwecker, of the ''[[Chicago Sun Times|Chicago Sun-Times]],'' stated, "It's a sweet and uplifting film, and though quite predictable, gives us a family drama that showcases simple truths about overcoming seemingly impossible odds and leaves you with a warm and very satisfying feeling deep down. It's a solid, hopeful and inspiring story that reminds us of what we might call 'old-fashioned' values about perseverance and making your dreams come true. Old-fashioned? Not at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/408618,WKP-News-gracie01.article |title='Gracie' uplifting family fare |access-date=2007-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014184343/http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/408618,WKP-News-gracie01.article |archive-date=2007-10-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen Gleiberman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' argued that "in 1978, a high school girl playing competitive soccer wasn't just novel – it was barely heard of. This amiable rouser, based on the experiences of Elisabeth Shue and her family, tries to convey how gutsy and role-smashing it is for ... Gracie to cleat her way onto an all-boys soccer team. So why is Gracie as processed as an [[after school special|after-school special]]? You miss the knockabout edge of ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]'' – though the ending, in its [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlovian]] sports-flick way, pumps you up."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20040676,00.html Review of ''Gracie'']&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Tobias of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' suggested that "though ''Gracie'' fashions Shue's story into ready-made inspirational formula, it's nonetheless vivid in its particulars, from the looks and sounds of late-'70s New Jersey to the portrait of a soccer-driven family reformed by loss."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/62279 Review of ''Gracie''] from ''[[The A.V. Club]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Lael Loewenstein of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that ''Gracie'' is "an earnest, well-acted, poignant drama that nevertheless runs afoul of [[List of sports clichés#Sports film clichés|sports movie clichés]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-gracie1jun01,0,7598824.story Review of ''Gracie''] from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Estes Kelsey''' (1873 – March 1, 1946) was an American Orthodontist who graduated from [[Angle School of Orthodontia]] in 1908. He was first Orthodontist in the State of Maryland.

==Life==
Kelsey received his dental degree from [[University of Maryland School of Dentistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Departmental Awards| url=https://www.dental.umaryland.edu/orthodontics/departmental-awards/|website=www.dental.umaryland.edu| accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught at [[University of Maryland School of Dentistry]] from 1906 to 1910, while graduating from Angle School of Orthodontia in 1908. In 1910 Kelsey became a professor of orthodontics at the school, and subsequently chairman in 1913. He remained as chairman until his retirement in 1940.

Dr. Kelsey has written 57 articles that have been published in various orthodontic journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Noyes| first1=Frederick| title=Harry E Kelsey|journal=Angle Orthodontist| date=1946| url=http://www.angle.org/doi/pdf/10.1043/0003-3219(1946)016%3C0049%3ADHEK%3E2.0.CO%3B2| accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was an active member of the [[American Association of Orthodontists]], the [[American Dental Association]], the Eastern Society of Orthodontia, and the Eastern Association of Angle Alumni.

Kelsey died at the age of 73 in 1946. The University of Maryland School of Dentistry has established a Harry E. Kelsey award in his memory.

The United States life expectancy is 78.6 years at birth, up from 75.2 years in 1990; this ranks 42nd among 224 nations, and 22nd out of the 35 industrialized [[OECD]] countries, down from 20th in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html |title=Country Comparison: Life Expectancy at Birth |publisher=CIA |work=The World Factbook|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Murray2013 /&gt; In 2016 and 2017 life expectancy in the U.S. dropped for the first time since 1993.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/21/health/us-life-expectancy-study/index.html|title=US life expectancy drops for second year in a row|last=CNN|first=Ben Tinker,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of 17 high-income countries studied by the [[National Institutes of Health]], the United States in 2013 had the highest or near-highest prevalence of obesity, car accidents, [[infant mortality]], heart and lung disease, sexually transmitted infections, [[teenage pregnancy in the United States|adolescent pregnancies]], injuries, and homicides.&lt;ref name="nihbph"&gt;National Research Council and Institute of Medicine.

Prohibitively high cost is the primary reason Americans have problems accessing health care.&lt;ref name="dpeaflcio.org" /&gt; Consulting company [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] recorded that the uninsured rate among U.S. adults was 11.9% for the first quarter of 2015, continuing the decline of the uninsured rate outset by the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/182348/uninsured-rate-dips-first-quarter.aspx|title=In U.S., Uninsurance rate Dips to 11.9% in First Quarter|website=Gallup}}&lt;/ref&gt; At over 27 million, higher than the entire population of Australia, the number of people without [[health insurance in the United States|health insurance]] coverage in the [[United States]] is one of the primary concerns raised by advocates of [[health care reform in the United States|health care reform]]. Lack of health insurance is associated with increased mortality, about sixty thousand preventable deaths per year, depending on the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/22/15857482/atul-gawande-gop-health-plan-bcra|title="There will be deaths": Atul Gawande on the GOP plan to replace Obamacare|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study done at Harvard Medical School with Cambridge Health Alliance showed that nearly 45,000 annual deaths are associated with a lack of patient health insurance. The study also found that uninsured, working Americans have an approximately 40% higher mortality risk compared to privately insured working Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/new-study-finds-45000-deaths-annually-linked-to-lack-of-health-coverage/|title=New study finds 45,000 deaths annually linked to lack of health coverage|date=2009-09-17|work=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) became law, enacting [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act#Overview of provisions|major changes]] in health insurance. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] upheld the constitutionality of most of the law in June 2012 and affirmed insurance exchange subsidies in all states in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/25/politics/supreme-court-ruling-obamacare/index.html |title=Obamacare lives on after Supreme Court ruling  |website=CNNPolitics.com |date=June 25, 2015 |accessdate=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hospitalizations ===
A study by the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ) found that there were 38.6 million hospital stays in the U.S. in 2011, up 11% since 1997. Since the population was also growing, the hospitalization rate remained stable at approximately 1,200 stays per 10,000 population during this period.&lt;ref name="hcup-us.ahrq.gov"&gt;Pfuntner A., Wier L.M., Elixhauser A.

[http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb166.jsp].&lt;/ref&gt; Hospital stays in 2011 averaged 4.5 days and cost an average of $10,400 per stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK259100/|title=Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Statistical Briefs: Overview of Hospital Stays in the United States, 2012|last=|first=|date=2006|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US)|year=|isbn=|location=Rockville (MD)|pages=|pmid=21413206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by the [[National Institutes of Health]] reported that the lifetime per capita expenditure at birth, using year 2000 dollars, showed a large difference between health care costs of females ($361,192) and males ($268,679). A large portion of this cost difference is in the shorter lifespan of men, but even after adjustment for age (assuming men live as long as women), there still is a 20% difference in lifetime health care expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2004|title=The lifetime distribution of health care costs|journal=Health Serv Res|volume=39|issue=3|pages=627–42|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2004.00248.x|pmc=1361028|pmid=15149482|vauthors=Alemayehu B, Warner KE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institute of Medicine, Committee on Monitoring Access to Personal Health Care Services. Millman M, editor. Washington: National Academies Press; 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, health insurance was most commonly acquired through a [[Group insurance|group plan]] tied to an employer, covering 150 million people.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2017/decline-employer-sponsored-health-insurance|title=The Decline of Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance|website=www.commonwealthfund.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major sources include Medicaid, covering 70 million, Medicare, 50 million, and [[Health insurance marketplace|health insurance marketplaces]] created by [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA) covering around 17 million.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In 2017, a study found that 73% of plans on ACA marketplaces had narrow networks, limiting access and choice in providers.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Measures of accessibility and affordability tracked by national health surveys include: percent of population with insurance, having a usual source of medical care, visiting the dentist yearly, rates of preventable hospitalizations, reported difficulty seeing a specialist, delaying care due to cost, and rates of health insurance coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis.htm|title=National Center for Health Statistics|website=Cdc.gov|accessdate=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, an OECD report noted that "all [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development#Member countries|OECD countries]] [except Mexico, Turkey, and the United States] had achieved universal or near-universal (at least 98.4% insured) coverage of their populations by 1990".&lt;ref name="Docteur 2004"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r6MLakbHnEQC&amp;pg=PA74|title=Towards high-performing health systems: policy studies|last1=Docteur|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Oxley|first2=Howard|date=October 19, 2004|publisher=OECD|isbn=978-92-64-01559-3|series=The OECD health project|location=Paris|pages=25, 74|chapter=Health-system reform: lessons from experience}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 IOM report also observed that "lack of health insurance causes roughly 18,000 unnecessary deaths every year in the United States,"&lt;ref name="IOM 2004" /&gt;

[[File:Gapminder_Life_Expectancy_in_high_income_countries.png|thumb|Life Expectancy of high-income countries in 2015.]]

Aa 2013 [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|National Research Council]] study stated that, when considered as one of 17 [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income countries]], the United States was at or near the top in [[infant mortality]], [[Cardiovascular disease|heart]] and [[Respiratory disease|lung]] disease, [[sexually transmitted infection]]s, [[Teenage pregnancy|adolescent pregnancies]], [[Injury|injuries]], [[homicide]]s, and rates of [[disability]]. Together, such issues place the U.S. at the bottom of the list for [[life expectancy]] in high-income countries. As of 2007, U.S. males could be expected to live almost four fewer years than those in Switzerland, and U.S. females could be expected to live over 5 years less than women in Japan.&lt;ref name="nihbph" /&gt; Females born in the U.S. in 2015 have a life expectancy of 81.6 years, and males 76.9 years; more than 3 years less and as much as over 5 years less than people born in Switzerland (85.3 F, 81.3 M) or Japan (86.8 F, 80.5 M) in 2015.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Causes of mortality in the U.S. ===
{{See also|List of causes of death by rate}}
The top three causes of death among both sexes and all ages in the U.S. have consistently remained cardiovascular diseases (ranked 1st), neoplasms (2nd) and neurological disorders (3rd), since the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ihmeuw.org/46l6|title=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation: United States both sexes, all ages, deaths per 100,000|last=|first=|date=|website=www.healthdata.org|language=en|access-date=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic lower respiratory disease.[[Health care in the United States#cite note-:7-54|&lt;sup&gt;[53]&lt;/sup&gt;]] In 2015, the total number of deaths by heart disease was 633,842, by cancer it was 595,930, and from chronic lower respiratory disease it was 155,041.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm|title=FastStats|date=2017-08-03|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, 267.18 per 100,000 deaths were caused by cardiovascular diseases, 204.63 by neoplasms and 100.66 by neurological disorders.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Diarrhea, lower respiratory and other common infections were ranked sixth overall, but had the highest rate of infectious disease mortality in the U.S. at 31.65 deaths per 100,000.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There is evidence, however, that a large proportion of health outcomes and early mortality can be attributed to factors other than communicable or non-communicable disease.

== Providers ==
[[Health care provider]]s in the U.S. encompass individual health care personnel, health care facilities and medical products.

=== Facilities ===
{{Main|Medical centers in the United States}}
In the U.S., ownership of the health care system is mainly in private hands, though federal, state, county, and city governments also own certain facilities.

As of 2018, there were 5,534 registered hospitals in the United States. There were 4,840 community hospitals, which are defined as nonfederal, short-term general, or specialty hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals|title=Fast Facts on U.S. Hospitals, 2018 {{!}} AHA|website=American Hospital Association|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[non-profit hospital]]s share of total hospital capacity has remained relatively stable (about 70%) for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Convergence between For-Profit and Nonprofit Hospitals in the United States|last=David|first=Guy|date=May 2005 |url=http://www.aeaweb.org/annual_mtg_papers/2006/0106_0800_0204.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226133139/http://www.aeaweb.org/annual_mtg_papers/2006/0106_0800_0204.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also [[For-profit hospital|privately owned for-profit hospitals]] as well as [[public hospital|government hospitals]] in some locations, mainly owned by county and city governments. The [[Hill-Burton Act]] was passed in 1946, which provided federal funding for hospitals in exchange for treating poor patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://congress.indiana.edu/hill%E2%80%93burton-act |title=The Hill–Burton Act &amp;#124; The Center On Congress at Indiana University |website=Congress.indiana.edu |date= |accessdate=December 1, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103062317/http://congress.indiana.edu/hill%E2%80%93burton-act# |archive-date=November 3, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:US Department of Veterans Affairs vertical logo.svg|thumb|170 px|US Department of Veterans Affairs vertical logo]]
There is no nationwide system of government-owned medical facilities open to the general public but there are local government-owned medical facilities open to the general public. The [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] operates field hospitals as well as permanent hospitals via the [[Military Health System]] to provide military-funded care to active military personnel.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The federal [[Veterans Health Administration]] operates [[List of Veterans Affairs medical facilities|VA hospitals]] open only to veterans, though veterans who seek medical care for conditions they did not receive while serving in the military are charged for services. The [[Indian Health Service]] (IHS) operates facilities open only to Native Americans from recognized tribes. These facilities, plus tribal facilities and privately contracted services funded by IHS to increase system capacity and capabilities, provide medical care to tribespeople beyond what can be paid for by any private insurance or other government programs.

[[Hospital]]s provide some outpatient care in their emergency rooms and specialty clinics, but primarily exist to provide inpatient care. Hospital [[emergency department]]s and [[urgent care]] centers are sources of sporadic problem-focused care. [[Surgicenter]]s are examples of specialty clinics. [[Hospice]] services for the terminally ill who are expected to live six months or less are most commonly subsidized by charities and government. Prenatal, [[family planning]], and [[dysplasia]] clinics are government-funded [[obstetric]] and [[gynecologic]] specialty clinics respectively, and are usually staffed by nurse practitioners.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}  Services, particularly urgent-care services, may also be delivered remotely via [[telemedicine]] by providers such as [[Teladoc]].

Besides government and private health care facilities, there are also 355 registered [[free clinics]] in the United States that provide limited medical services. They are considered to be part of the [[social safety net]] for those who lack health insurance. Their services may range from more acute care (i.e. STDs, injuries, respiratory diseases) to long term care (i.e. dentistry, counseling).&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nadkarni|first1=M|last2=Philbrick|first2=J|date=2005|title=Free Clinics: A National Survey|journal=The American Journal of the Medical Sciences|volume=330|issue=1|page=25–31|doi=10.1097/00000441-200507000-00005|pmid=16020996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another component of the healthcare safety net would be federally funded [[Community health centers in the United States|community health centers]].

=== Physicians (M.D. and D.O.) ===
{{Main|Physician in the United States}}
Physicians in the U.S. include those trained by the [[Medical education in the United States|U.S. medical education]] system, and those that are [[international medical graduate]]s who have progressed through the necessary steps to acquire a [[medical license]] to practice in a state.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} This includes going through the three steps of the Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE).  The first step of the USMLE tests whether medical students both understand and are capable of applying the basic scientific foundations to medicine after the second year of medical school. The topics include: anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, pathology, pharmacology, physiology, behavioral sciences, nutrition, genetics, and aging. The step 2 is designed to test whether medical students can apply their medical skills and knowledge to actual clinical practice during students’ fourth year of medical school. The step 3 is done after the first year of residency.

The [[American College of Physicians]], uses the term ''physician'' to describe all medical practitioners holding a professional [[medical degree]]. In the U.S., the vast majority of physicians have a [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.fsmb.org/Media/Default/PDF/Census/2016census.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215170531/http://www.fsmb.org/Media/Default/PDF/Census/2016census.pdf# |archive-date=December 15, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] (D.O.) degrees get similar training and go through the same MLE steps as MD’s and so are also allowed to use the title "physician".

=== Medical products, research and development ===
As in most other countries, the manufacture and production of [[Medication|pharmaceuticals]] and [[medical devices]] is carried out by private companies. The research and development of medical devices and pharmaceuticals is supported by both public and private sources of funding. In 2003, research and development expenditures were approximately $95 billion with $40 billion coming from public sources and $55 billion coming from private sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csic.es/vri/otros-programas/esf/EMRC_Whitepaper.pdf|title=(Open using Adobe reader) p. 16|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004085517/http://www.csic.es/vri/otros-programas/esf/EMRC_Whitepaper.pdf|archivedate=October 4, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Medical Research Spending Doubled Over Past Decade"&gt;[http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/HealthPolicy/tb/1767 Medical Research Spending Doubled Over Past Decade], Neil Osterweil, MedPage Today, September 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative medicine ===
Outside of the standard health care system, more and more people are seeking [[Alternative medicine|alternative treatment]] options. These treatments are defined as therapies generally not taught in medical school nor available in hospitals. They include herbs, massages, energy healing, homeopathy, and more. A national survey found that from 1990 to 1997, the use of at least one alternative therapy has increased from 33.8% to 42.1%.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenberg|first1=D|date=1998|title=Trends in Alternative Medicine Use in the United States, 1990-1997 Results of a Follow-up National Survey|journal=JAMA|volume=280|issue=18|pages=1569–1575|doi=10.1001/jama.280.18.1569}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies concurred that about 40% of adults in 2007 used some form of Complementary and Alternative Medicine within the past year. Their reasons for seeking these alternative approaches included improving their well-being, engaging in a transformational experience, gaining more control over their own health, or finding a better way to relieve symptoms caused by chronic disease. They aim to treat not just physical illness but fix its underlying nutritional, social, emotional, and spiritual causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Barnes|first1=Patricia M.|last2=Bloom|first2=Barbara|last3=Nahin|first3=Richard L.|journal=National Health Statistics Report|number=12|date=December 10, 2008|title=Complementary and alternative medicine use among adults and children; United States, 2007|url=https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/5266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most users pay for these services out of pocket, as insurance tends to provide either partial or no coverage of most services.

Free-market advocates claim that the health care system is "dysfunctional" because the system of third-party payments from insurers removes the patient as a major participant in the financial and medical choices that affect costs. The Cato Institute claims that because government intervention has expanded insurance availability through programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, this has exacerbated the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Liebowitz, Stan [http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa211.html Policy Analysis: Why Health Care Costs So Much], Cato Institute, June 23, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study paid for by [[America's Health Insurance Plans]] (a Washington lobbyist for the health insurance industry) and carried out by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, increased utilization is the primary driver of rising health care costs in the U.S.&lt;ref name="PWC"&gt;[http://www.ahipbelieves.com/media/The%20Factors%20Fueling%20Rising%20Healthcare%20Costs.pdf The Factors Fueling Rising Healthcare Costs 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127151147/http://www.ahipbelieves.com/media/The%20Factors%20Fueling%20Rising%20Healthcare%20Costs.pdf#|date=November 27, 2007}}, PriceWaterhouseCoopers for America's Health Insurance Plans, 2006.

Low reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid have increased cost-shifting pressures on hospitals and doctors, who charge higher rates for the same services to private payers, which eventually affects health insurance rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/0612/0612.costshift.html|title=Confronting The Medicare Cost Shift|work=Managed Care Magazine|accessdate=June 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation and oversight ==
{{Further|American Board of Medical Specialties|United States Medical Licensing Examination|National Association of Insurance Commissioners}}

=== Involved organizations and institutions ===
Healthcare is subject to extensive regulation at both the [[federal government of the United States|federal]] and the [[U.S. state|state level]], much of which "arose haphazardly".&lt;ref name=just /&gt; Under this system, the federal government cedes primary responsibility to the states under the [[McCarran-Ferguson Act]]. Essential regulation includes the [[licensure]] of [[health care provider]]s at the state level and the testing and approval of [[pharmaceutical]]s and [[medical device]]s by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and laboratory testing. These regulations are designed to protect consumers from ineffective or fraudulent healthcare. Additionally, states regulate the health insurance market and they often have laws which require that health insurance companies cover certain procedures,&lt;ref name="Bunce&amp;Wieske2008"&gt;Victoria Craig Bunce and JP Wieske, [http://www.cahi.org/cahi_contents/resources/pdf/HealthInsuranceMandates2008.pdf "Health Insurance Mandates in the States 2008"], The Council for Affordable Health Insurance, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; although state mandates generally do not apply to the [[self-funded health care]] plans offered by large employers, which exempt from state laws under preemption clause of the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]].

In 2010, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA) was signed by President [[Barack Obama]] and includes various new regulations, with one of the most notable being a [[health insurance mandate]] which requires all citizens to purchase health insurance. While not regulation per se, the federal government also has a major influence on the healthcare market through its payments to providers under Medicare and Medicaid, which in some cases are used as a reference point in the negotiations between medical providers and insurance companies.&lt;ref name=just /&gt;

At the federal level, [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] oversees the various federal agencies involved in health care. The health agencies are a part of the [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Service]], and include the Food and Drug Administration, which certifies the safety of food, effectiveness of drugs and medical products, the Centers for Disease Prevention, which prevents disease, premature death, and disability, the Agency of Health Care Research and Quality, the Agency Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which regulates hazardous spills of toxic substances, and the [[National Institutes of Health]], which conducts [[medical research]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

[[State governments of the United States|State governments]] maintain [[state health department]]s, and [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] ([[County (United States)|counties]] and [[Municipality|municipalities]]) often have their own health departments, usually branches of the state health department. Regulations of a state board may have executive and police strength to enforce state health laws. In some states, all members of state boards must be health care professionals. Members of state boards may be assigned by the governor or elected by the state committee. Members of local boards may be elected by the mayor council. The McCarran–Ferguson Act, which cedes regulation to the states, does not itself regulate insurance, nor does it mandate that states regulate insurance. "Acts of Congress" that do not expressly purport to regulate the "business of insurance" will not preempt state laws or regulations that regulate the "business of insurance." The Act also provides that federal anti-trust laws will not apply to the "business of insurance" as long as the state regulates in that area, but federal anti-trust laws will apply in cases of boycott, coercion, and intimidation. By contrast, most other federal laws will not apply to insurance whether the states regulate in that area or not.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

[[Industry self-regulation|Self-policing]] of providers by providers is a major part of oversight. Many health care organizations also voluntarily submit to inspection and certification by the [[Joint Commission]] on Accreditation of Hospital Organizations, JCAHO. Providers also undergo testing to obtain [[board certification]] attesting to their skills. A report issued by [[Public Citizen]] in April 2008 found that, for the third year in a row, the number of serious disciplinary actions against physicians by state medical boards declined from 2006 to 2007, and called for more oversight of the boards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?DR_ID=51710 "Coverage &amp; Access: Disciplinary Action Against Physicians Dropped 6% From 2006 to 2007, Report Finds,"]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Kaiser Daily Health Policy Report, [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], April 23, 2008.

The federal [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) publishes an on-line searchable database of performance data on [[nursing homes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/Include/DataSection/Questions/SearchCriteria.asp?version=default&amp;browser=IE%7C6%7CWinXP&amp;language=English&amp;defaultstatus=0&amp;pagelist=Home&amp;CookiesEnabledStatus=True Nursing Home Compare,] [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (accessed April 24, 2008).

In 2004, libertarian think tank [[Cato Institute]] published a study which concluded that regulation provides benefits in the amount of $170&amp;nbsp;billion but costs the public up to $340&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="Cato2004"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Health Care Regulation: A $169 Billion Hidden Tax | author = Christopher J.

=== "Certificates of need" for hospitals ===
In 1978, the federal government required that all states implement [[Certificate of Need]] (CON) programs for cardiac care, meaning that hospitals had to apply and receive certificates prior to implementing the program; the intent was to reduce cost by reducing duplicate investments in facilities.&lt;ref name="Hoetal2009" /&gt; It has been observed that these certificates could be used to increase costs through weakened competition.&lt;ref name=just&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/health_care/204694.pdf Improving Health Care: A Dose of Competition], Report by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Many states removed the CON programs after the federal requirement expired in 1986, but some states still have these programs.&lt;ref name="Hoetal2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ho V, Ku-Goto MH, Jollis JG | title = Certificate of Need (CON) for cardiac care: controversy over the contributions of CON | journal = Health Serv Res | volume = 44 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 483–500 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19207590 | pmc = 2677050 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2008.00933.x | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research looking at the costs in areas where these programs have been discontinued have not found a clear effect on costs, and the CON programs could decrease costs because of reduced facility construction or increase costs due to reduced competition.&lt;ref name="Hoetal2009" /&gt;

The [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) has lobbied the government to highly limit physician education since 1910, currently at 100,000 doctors per year,&lt;ref name=evilama&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/25/american-medical-association-opinions-columnists-shikha-dalmia.html|title=The Evil-Mongering of the American Medical Association|first=Shikha|last=Dalmia|date=August 26, 2009|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has led to a shortage of doctors&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-03-02-doctor-shortage_x.htm Medical miscalculation creates doctor shortage], USA Today, March 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;.

An even bigger problem may be that the doctors are paid for procedures instead of results.&lt;ref name=nytbill&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/weekinreview/29berenson.html?_r=5&amp;ex=1187323200&amp;en=2006b742be8795d8&amp;ei=5070 Sending Back the Doctor's Bill], ''[[The New York Times]]'' July 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The AMA has also aggressively lobbied for many restrictions that require doctors to carry out operations that might be carried out by cheaper workforce. For example, in 1995, 36 states banned or restricted midwifery even though it delivers equally safe care to that by doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/25/american-medical-association-opinions-columnists-shikha-dalmia.html|title=The Evil-Mongering Of The American Medical Association|last=Dalmia|first=Shikha|date=August 26, 2009|work=Forbes|access-date=October 22, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulation lobbied by the AMA has decreased the amount and quality of health care, according to the consensus of economist: the restrictions do not add to quality, they decrease the supply of care.&lt;ref name=evilama /&gt;  Moreover, psychologists, nurses and pharmacists are not allowed to prescribe medicines.{{Clarify||sentence intends to say "write formal prescriptions.

==== Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) ====
{{Main|Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act}}
EMTALA, enacted by the federal government in 1986, requires that hospital emergency departments treat emergency conditions of all patients regardless of their ability to pay and is considered a critical element in the "safety net" for the uninsured, but established no direct payment mechanism for such care. Indirect payments and reimbursements through federal and state government programs have never fully compensated public and private hospitals for the full cost of care mandated by EMTALA. More than half of all emergency care in the U.S. now goes uncompensated.&lt;ref name="ACEP"&gt;[http://www.acep.org/patients.aspx?id=25932 The Uninsured: Access to Medical Care] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304211332/http://www.acep.org/patients.aspx?id=25932# |date=March 4, 2010 }}, American College of Emergency Physicians. Retrieved October 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to some analyses, EMTALA is an unfunded mandate that has contributed to financial pressures on hospitals in the last 20 years, causing them to consolidate and close facilities, and contributing to emergency room overcrowding. According to the [[Institute of Medicine]], between 1993 and 2003, emergency room visits in the U.S. grew by 26%, while in the same period, the number of emergency departments declined by 425.&lt;ref name="IOM fact sheet"&gt;[http://www.iom.edu/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2006/Hospital-Based-Emergency-Care-At-the-Breaking-Point/EmergencyCareFindingsandRecs.ashx Fact Sheet: The Future of Emergency Care: Key Findings and Recommendations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922075640/http://www.iom.edu/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2006/Hospital-Based-Emergency-Care-At-the-Breaking-Point/EmergencyCareFindingsandRecs.ashx |date=September 22, 2011 }}, Institute of Medicine, 2006. Retrieved October 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mentally ill patients present a unique challenge for emergency departments and hospitals. In accordance with EMTALA, mentally ill patients who enter emergency rooms are evaluated for emergency medical conditions. Once mentally ill patients are medically stable, regional mental health agencies are contacted to evaluate them. Patients are evaluated as to whether they are a danger to themselves or others. Those meeting this criterion are admitted to a mental health facility to be further evaluated by a psychiatrist. Typically, mentally ill patients can be held for up to 72 hours, after which a court order is required.

=== Quality assurance ===
{{See also|Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration}}
Health care quality assurance consists of the "activities and programs intended to assure or improve the quality of care in either a defined medical setting or a program. The concept includes the assessment or evaluation of the quality of care; identification of problems or shortcomings in the delivery of care; designing activities to overcome these deficiencies; and follow-up monitoring to ensure effectiveness of corrective steps."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2011/MB_cgi?mode=&amp;term=Quality%20Assurance,%20Health%20Care|website=U.S. National Library of Medicine|title=National Library of Medicine – Medical Subject Headings, 2011 MeSH, MeSH Descriptor Data, Quality Assurance, Health Care|author=|publisher=National Institutes of Health|location=Bethesda, MD |accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Private companies such as [[Grand Rounds, Inc.|Grand Rounds]] also release quality information and offer services to employers and plans to map quality within their networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2016/12/14/should-big-data-pick-your-next-doctor/|title=Should Big Data Pick Your Next Doctor?|last=Herper|first=Matthew|work=Forbes|access-date=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One innovation in encouraging quality of health care is the public reporting of the performance of hospitals, health professionals or providers, and healthcare organizations. However, there is "no consistent evidence that the public release of performance data changes consumer behaviour or improves care."&lt;ref name="pmid22071813"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ketelaar NA, Faber MJ, Flottorp S, Rygh LH, Deane KH, Eccles MP | title = Public release of performance data in changing the behaviour of healthcare consumers, professionals or organisations | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 11 | issue = 11 | pages = CD004538 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22071813 | pmc =  4204393| doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004538.pub2 | url =  | editor1-last = Ketelaar | editor1-first = Nicole ABM}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30188566|date = November 2018}}

== Overall system effectiveness ==

=== Measures of effectiveness ===
The US health care delivery system unevenly provides medical care of varying quality to its population.&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, Janet M. "Crossing the quality chasm." Building a Better Delivery System (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In a highly effective health care system, individuals would receive reliable care that meets their needs and is based on the best scientific knowledge available.
In order to monitor and evaluate system effectiveness, researchers and policy makers track system measures and trends over time. The [[DHHS|US Department of Health and Human Services]](HHS) populates a publicly available dashboard called, the Health System Measurement Project (healthmeasures.aspe.hhs.gov), to ensure a robust monitoring system. The dashboard captures the access, quality and cost of care; overall population health; and health system dynamics (e.g., workforce, innovation, health information technology). Included measures align with other system performance measuring activities including the HHS Strategic Plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/strategic-plan/priorities.html|title=Strategic Plan and Priorities – HHS.gov|date=August 26, 2013|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826222449/http://www.hhs.gov/strategic-plan/priorities.html|archivedate=August 26, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Government Performance and Results Act]], [[Healthy People program|Healthy People 2020]], and the National Strategies for Quality and Prevention.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.surgeongeneral.gov/priorities/prevention/strategy/report.pdf|title=National Prevention Strategy|last=|first=|date=|year=2011|website=National Prevention Council|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General|location=Washington, DC|format=PDF|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://healthmeasures.aspe.hhs.gov/about|title=About|date=January 13, 2013|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113042412/https://healthmeasures.aspe.hhs.gov/about|archivedate=January 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Waiting times ====
Waiting times in American health care are usually short, but are not usually 0 for non-urgent care at least.  Also, a minority of American patients wait longer than is perceived. In a 2010 Commonwealth Fund survey, most Americans self-reported waiting less than four weeks for their most recent specialist appointment and less than one month for elective surgery.  However, about 30% of patients reported waiting longer than one month for elective surgery, and about 20% longer than four weeks for their most recent specialist appointment (The Commonwealth Fund, 2010, pp. 19–20).&lt;ref&gt;The Commonwealth Fund. (2010). ''Commonwealth Fund 2010 Health Policy Survey in 11 Countries (''pp. 19-20). New York, NY: Author. Accessed from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/chartbook/2010/pdf_2010_ihp_survey_chartpack_full_12022010.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  These percentages were smaller than in France, the U.K., New Zealand and Canada, but not better than Germany and Switzerland (although waits shorter than four weeks/one month may not be equally long across these three countries).  The number of respondents may not be enough to be fully representative.  In a study in 1994 comparing Ontario to three regions of the U.S., self-reported mean wait times to see an orthopedic surgeon were two weeks in those parts of the U.S., and four weeks in Canada.  Mean waits for the knee or hip surgery were self-reported as three weeks in those parts of the U.S. and eight weeks in Ontario (citation needed).  However, current waits in both countries' regions may have changed since then (certainly in Canada waiting times went up later - citation neede). 

It is unclear how many of the American patients waiting longer have to.  Some may be by choice, because they wish to go to a well-known specialist or clinic that many people wish to attend, and are willing to wait to do so.  Waiting times may also vary by region.  One experiment reported that uninsured patients experienced longer waits (citation needed); patients with poor insurance coverage probably face a disproportionate number of long waits.  

American health care tends to rely on rationing by exclusion (uninsured and underinsured), out-of-pocket costs for the insured, fixed payments per case to hospitals (resulting in very short stays), and contracts that manage demand instead (citation needed).

==== Population health: quality, prevention, vulnerable populations ====
The health of the population is also viewed as a measure of the overall effectiveness of the healthcare system. The extent to which the population lives longer healthier lives signals an effective system.
* While life expectancy is one measure, [[DHHS|HHS]] uses a '''composite health measure''' that estimates not only the average length of life, but also, the part of life expectancy that is expected to be "in good or better health, as well as free of activity limitations." Between 1997 and 2010, the number of expected high quality life years increased from 61.1 to 63.2 years for newborns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://healthmeasures.aspe.hhs.gov/measure/65|title=Measure Details|date=February 15, 2013|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215160734/https://healthmeasures.aspe.hhs.gov/measure/65|archivedate=February 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The underutilization of preventative measures, rates of preventable illness and prevalence of chronic disease suggest that the US healthcare system does not sufficiently promote wellness.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Over the past decade rates of teen pregnancy and low birth rates have come down significantly, but not disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus13.pdf |format=PDF |title=Health, United States, 2013 |website=Cdc.gov |accessdate=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of obesity, heart disease (high blood pressure, controlled high cholesterol), and type 2 diabetes are areas of major concern. While chronic disease and multiple co-morbidities became increasingly common among a population of elderly Americans who were living longer, the public health system has also found itself fending off a rise of chronically ill younger generation. According to the US Surgeon General "The prevalence of obesity in the U.S. more than doubled (from 15% to 34%) among adults and more than tripled (from 5% to 17%) among children and adolescents from 1980 to 2008."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Surgeon General's Vision for a Healthy and Fit Nation|location=Rockville, Maryland|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General|date=January 2010|url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A concern for the health system is that the health gains do not accrue equally to the entire population. In the United States, disparities in health care and health outcomes are widespread.&lt;ref&gt;IOM (Institute of Medicine). 2012. How far have we come in reducing health disparities?: Progress since 2000: Workshop summary. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Minorities are more likely to suffer from serious illnesses (e.g., type 2 diabetes, heart disease and colon cancer) and less likely to have access to quality health care, including preventative services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://healthmeasures.aspe.hhs.gov/topic/I|title=Topic Area|date=February 14, 2013|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214043644/https://healthmeasures.aspe.hhs.gov/topic/I|archivedate=February 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts are underway to close the gap and to provide a more equitable system of care.

==== Innovation: workforce, healthcare IT, R&amp;D ====
Finally, the United States tracks investment in the healthcare system in terms of a skilled healthcare workforce, meaningful use of healthcare IT, and R&amp;D output. This aspect of the healthcare system performance dashboard is important to consider when evaluating cost of care in America. That is because in much of the policy debate around the high cost of US healthcare, proponents of highly specialized and cutting edge technologies point to innovation as a marker of an effective health care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ASPE |url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/sp/reports/2012/costandinnovation/ib.shtml |title=Health Care Cost Containment and Medical Innovation  |website=Aspe.hhs.gov |date=July 23, 2012 |accessdate=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) found that the U.S. ranked poorly in terms of [[years of potential life lost]] (YPLL), a statistical measure of years of life lost under the age of 70 that were amenable to being saved by health care. Among OECD nations for which data are available, the United States ranked third last for the health care of women (after Mexico and Hungary) and fifth last for men (Slovakia and Poland also ranked worse).
{{Further|Years of potential life lost}}

Recent studies find growing gaps in life expectancy based on income and geography. In 2008, a government-sponsored study found that life expectancy declined from 1983 to 1999 for women in 180 counties, and for men in 11 counties, with most of the life expectancy declines occurring in the Deep South, Appalachia, along the Mississippi River, in the Southern Plains and in Texas. The difference is as high as three years for men, six years for women. The gap is growing between rich and poor and by educational level, but narrowing between men and women and by race.&lt;ref name="Ezzati2008"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ezzati M, Friedman AB, Kulkarni SC, Murray CJ | title = The reversal of fortunes: trends in county mortality and cross-county mortality disparities in the United States | journal = PLoS Med | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = e66 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18433290 | pmc = 2323303 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0050066 | laysummary = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/27/weekinreview/27sack.html | editor1-last = Novotny | editor1-first = Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that the mortality gap between the well-educated and the poorly educated widened significantly between 1993 and 2001 for adults ages 25 through 64; the authors speculated that risk factors such as smoking, obesity and high blood pressure may lie behind these disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jemal A, Ward E, Anderson RN, Murray T, Thun MJ | year = 2008 | title = Widening of Socioeconomic Inequalities in U.S. Death Rates, 1993–2001 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 3 | issue = 5| page = e2181 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0002181 | editor1-last = Sorensen | editor1-first = Thorkild I.

A report released in April 2008 by the [[Foundation for Child Development]], which studied the period from 1994 through 2006, found mixed results for the health of children in the U.S. Mortality rates for children ages 1 through 4 dropped by a third, and the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels dropped by 84%. The percentage of mothers who smoked during pregnancy also declined. On the other hand, both obesity and the percentage of low-birth weight babies increased. The authors note that the increase in babies born with low birth weights can be attributed to women delaying childbearing and the increased use of fertility drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Donna St. George, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/23/AR2008042303666.html "For Children, a Better Beginning,"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', April 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth C.

In a sample of 13 developed countries the US was third in its population weighted usage of medication in 14 classes in both 2009 and 2013. The drugs studied were selected on the basis that the conditions treated had high incidence, prevalence and/or mortality, caused significant long-term morbidity and incurred high levels of expenditure and significant developments in prevention or treatment had been made in the last 10 years.

== System efficiency and equity ==
Variations in the efficiency of health care delivery can cause variations in outcomes. The [[The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice|Dartmouth Atlas Project]], for instance, reported that, for over 20 years, marked variations in how medical resources are distributed and used in the United States were accompanied by marked variations in outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/index.shtm |title=Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care |website=Dartmouthatlas.org |date=December 30, 2015 |accessdate=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The willingness of physicians to work in an area varies with the income of the area and the amenities it offers, a situation aggravated by a general shortage of doctors in the United States, particularly those who offer primary care. The Affordable Care Act, if implemented, will produce an additional demand for services which the existing stable of primary care doctors will be unable to fill, particularly in economically depressed areas. Training additional physicians would require some years.&lt;ref name=NYT72812&gt;{{cite news|title=Doctor Shortage Likely to Worsen With Health Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/health/policy/too-few-doctors-in-many-us-communities.html|accessdate=July 29, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 28, 2012|author=Annie Lowrey|author2=Robert Pear}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Efficiency ===

==== Preventable deaths ====
In 2010, [[coronary artery disease]], [[lung cancer]], [[stroke]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]s, and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the US. Low back pain, [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[musculoskeletal disorder]]s, neck pain, and [[anxiety]] caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious [[risk factor]]s were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, [[high blood pressure]], [[high blood sugar]], physical inactivity, and alcohol use. [[Alzheimer's disease]], drug abuse, kidney disease and cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.&lt;ref name=Murray2013 /&gt;

Between 1990 and 2010, among the 34 countries in the OECD, the US dropped from 18th to 27th in age-standardized death rate. The US dropped from 23rd to 28th for age-standardized years of life lost. It dropped from 20th to 27th in life expectancy at birth. It dropped from 14th to 26th for healthy life expectancy.&lt;ref name=Murray2013&gt;{{cite journal | title = The State of US Health, 1990–2010: Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 310 | issue = 6 | pages = 591–608 | date = July 10, 2013 | pmid = 23842577 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2013.13805 | url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/JAMA/0/joi130037.pdf | accessdate = July 11, 2013 | author=Murray CJ, Atkinson C, Bhalla K et al | pmc=5436627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2009 study conducted at [[Harvard Medical School]] by co-founders of [[Physicians for a National Health Program]], a pro-single payer lobbying group, and published by the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', [[Health insurance coverage in the United States|lack of health coverage]] is associated with nearly 45,000 excess preventable deaths annually.&lt;ref name="Harvard Gazette"&gt;David Cecere (September 17, 2009).

==== Value for money ====
A study of international health care spending levels published in the health policy journal ''[[Health Affairs]]'' in the year 2000 found that the United States spends substantially more on health care than any other country in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and that the use of health care services in the U.S. is below the OECD median by most measures. The authors of the study conclude that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. than elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Prices Stupid"&gt;Gerard F. Anderson, Uwe E. Reinhardt, Peter S. Hussey and Varduhi Petrosyan, [http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/abstract/22/3/89 "It's The Prices, Stupid: Why The United States Is So Different From Other Countries"], ''Health Affairs'', Volume 22, Number 3, May/June 2003.

==== Delays in seeking care and increased use of emergency care ====
Uninsured Americans are less likely to have regular health care and use preventive services. They are more likely to delay seeking care, resulting in more medical crises, which are more expensive than ongoing treatment for such conditions as diabetes and high blood pressure. A 2007 study published in ''JAMA'' concluded that uninsured people were less likely than the insured to receive any medical care after an accidental injury or the onset of a new chronic condition. The uninsured with an injury were also twice as likely as those with insurance to have received none of the recommended follow-up care, and a similar pattern held for those with a new chronic condition.&lt;ref&gt;Hadley, Jack, [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/297/10/1073?ijkey=n3EAhc0mdQ3nc&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=amajnls "Insurance Coverage, Medical Care Use, and Short-term Health Changes Following an Unintentional Injury or the Onset of a Chronic Condition"], JAMA, March 14, 2007; 297: 1073–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Uninsured patients are twice as likely to visit hospital emergency rooms as those with insurance; burdening a system meant for true emergencies with less-urgent care needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad388.pdf |title=Advance Data From Vital and Health Statistics No. 388  |website=Cdc.gov |format=PDF |date= June 28, 2007|accessdate=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 researchers with the [[American Cancer Society]] found that individuals who lacked private insurance (including those covered by Medicaid) were more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage cancer than those who had such insurance.&lt;ref name="Halpern2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Halpern MT, Ward EM, Pavluck AL, Schrag NM, Bian J, Chen AY | title = Association of insurance status and ethnicity with cancer stage at diagnosis for 12 cancer sites: a retrospective analysis | journal = The Lancet Oncology | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 222–31 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18282806 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/S1470-2045(08)70032-9 | url =}} Lay summary: [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/18/health/18cancer.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1203443524-1XOu0YisWP8MKgZnPMWtbQ Study Finds Cancer Diagnosis Linked to Insurance], ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Variations in provider practices ====
The treatment given to a patient can vary significantly depending on which health care providers they use. Research suggests that some cost-effective treatments are not used as often as they should be, while [[overutilization]] occurs with other health care services. Unnecessary treatments increase costs and can cause patients unnecessary anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Ulene, [http://www.latimes.com/features/printedition/health/la-he-themd5-2008may05,0,2608989.story "Costs of overtreating patients,"] [[Los Angeles Times]], May 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The use of prescription drugs varies significantly by geographic region.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Cox, Doug Mager, Ed Weisbart, [http://www.express-scripts.com/ourcompany/news/outcomesresearch/onlinepublications/study/geoVariationTrends.pdf "Geographic Variation Trends in Prescription Use: 2000 to 2006,"] [[Express Scripts]], January 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227072600/http://www.express-scripts.com/ourcompany/news/outcomesresearch/onlinepublications/study/geoVariationTrends.pdf |date=February 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overuse of medical benefits is known as [[moral hazard]] – individuals who are insured are then more inclined to consume health care. The way the Health care system tries to eliminate this problem is through cost sharing tactics like co-pays and deductibles. If patients face more of the economic burden they will then only consume health care when they perceive it to be necessary. According to the RAND health insurance experiment, individuals with higher Coinsurance rates consumed less health care than those with lower rates. The experiment concluded that with less consumption of care there was generally no loss in societal welfare but, for the poorer and sicker groups of people there were definitely negative effects. These patients were forced to forgo necessary preventative care measures in order to save money leading to late diagnosis of easily treated diseases and more expensive procedures later. With less preventative care, the patient is hurt financially with an increase in expensive visits to the ER. The health care costs in the US will also rise with these procedures as well. More expensive procedures lead to greater costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/topics/effective_care.pdf "Effective Care,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216012730/http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/topics/effective_care.pdf |date=February 16, 2008 }} The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, January 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurence C.

==== Care coordination ====
Primary care doctors are often the point of entry for most patients needing care, but in the fragmented health care system of the U.S., many patients and their providers experience problems with care coordination. For example, a Harris Interactive survey of [[California]] physicians found that:
* Four of every ten physicians report that their patients have had problems with coordination of their care in the last 12 months.
* More than 60% of doctors report that their patients "sometimes" or "often" experience long wait times for diagnostic tests.
* Some 20% of doctors report having their patients repeat tests because of an inability to locate the results during a scheduled visit.&lt;ref&gt;California HealthCare Foundation, [http://www.chcf.org/topics/view.cfm?itemid=133466 "Uncoordinated Care: A Survey of Physician and Patient Experience"], Harris Interactive. 2007. Retrieved March 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the relationship between doctors and patients is deteriorating.&lt;ref name="NYTJuly2008"&gt;Tare Parker-Pople, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/health/29well.html?scp=1&amp;sq=doctor%20and%20patient%20now%20at%20odds&amp;st=cse "Well: Doctor and Patient, Now at Odds,"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A study from [[Johns Hopkins University]] found that roughly one in four patients believe their doctors have exposed them to unnecessary risks, and anecdotal evidence such as self-help books and web postings suggest increasing patient frustration. Possible factors behind the deteriorating doctor/patient relationship include the current system for training physicians and differences in how doctors and patients view the practice of medicine. Doctors may focus on diagnosis and treatment, while patients may be more interested in wellness and being listened to by their doctors.&lt;ref name="NYTJuly2008" /&gt;

Many primary care physicians no longer see their patients while they are in the hospital; instead, [[hospitalist]]s are used.&lt;ref&gt;Hospitalists and the family physician [http://www.aafp.org/afp/980800ap/edit.html] by Bruce Bagley, M.D.; American Family Physician&lt;/ref&gt; The use of hospitalists is sometimes mandated by health insurance companies as a cost-saving measure which is resented by some primary care physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acpinternist.org/archives/1999/05/hosps.htm |title=Use of mandatory hospitalists blasted, ACP Observer May 99 |website=Acpinternist.org |date=February 16, 1999 |accessdate=December 1, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019223115/http://www.acpinternist.org/archives/1999/05/hosps.htm |archivedate=October 19, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Administrative costs ====
The health care system in the U.S. has a vast number of players. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of insurance companies in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Krugman"&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 "The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It"]
By Paul Krugman, Robin Wells, New York Review of Books, March 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The trade association [[America's Health Insurance Plans]], has some 1,300&amp;nbsp;members.&lt;/ref&gt; This system has considerable administrative overhead, far greater than in nationalized, single-payer systems, such as Canada's. An oft-cited study by Harvard Medical School and the Canadian Institute for Health Information determined that some 31% of U.S. health care dollars, or more than $1,000 per person per year, went to health care administrative costs, nearly double the administrative overhead in Canada, on a percentage basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnhp.org/publications/nejmadmin.pdf "Costs of Health Administration in the U.S. and Canada"], Woolhandler, et al., NEJM 349(8) September 21, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the insurance industry group [[America's Health Insurance Plans]], administrative costs for private health insurance plans have averaged approximately 12% of premiums over the last 40 years. There has been a shift in the type and distribution of administrative expenses over that period. The cost of adjudicating claims has fallen, while insurers are spending more on other administrative activities, such as medical management, nurse help lines, and negotiating discounted fees with health care providers.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Lemieux, [http://www.ahipresearch.org/pdfs/Administrative_Costs_030705.pdf "Perspective: Administrative Costs of Private Health Insurance Plans"], [[America's Health Insurance Plans]], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study published by the [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association]] (BCBSA) also found that health insurer administrative costs were approximately 11% to 12% of premiums, with Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans reporting slightly lower administrative costs, on average, than commercial insurers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcbs.com/betterknowledge/cost/Cost_Admin030703.pdf "Understanding Health Plan Administrative Costs"], [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association|Blue Cross Blue Shield Association]], 2003 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026063247/http://www.bcbs.com/betterknowledge/cost/Cost_Admin030703.pdf |date=October 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the period 1998 through 2003, average insurer administrative costs declined from 13% to 12% of premiums. The largest increases in administrative costs were in customer service and information technology, and the largest decreases were in provider services and contracting and in general administration.&lt;ref&gt;Kent J. Sacia and Robert H. Dobson, "Health Plan Administrative Cost Trends," Prepared for the [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association|BlueCross BlueShield Association]] by Milliman USA, February 20, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The McKinsey Global Institute estimated that excess spending on "health administration and insurance" accounted for as much as 21% of the estimated total excess spending ($477&amp;nbsp;billion in 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/21/why-does-us-health-care-cost-so-much-part-ii-indefensible-administrative-costs/ | work=The New York Times | title=Why Does U.S. Health Care Cost So Much?

According to a report published by the [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] in 2008, administrative costs for private insurance represent approximately 12% of premiums. Variations in administrative costs between private plans are largely attributable to economies of scale. Coverage for large employers has the lowest administrative costs.

=== Third-party payment problem and consumer-driven insurance ===
Most Americans pay for medical services largely through insurance, and this can distort the incentives of consumers since the consumer pays only a portion of the ultimate cost directly.&lt;ref name=just /&gt; The lack of price information on medical services can also distort incentives.&lt;ref name=just /&gt; The insurance which pays on behalf of insureds negotiate with medical providers, sometimes using government-established prices such as Medicaid billing rates as a reference point.&lt;ref name=just /&gt; This reasoning has led for calls to reform the insurance system to create a [[consumer-driven health care]] system whereby consumers pay more out-of-pocket.&lt;ref name="Scandlen2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Scandlen G | title = Consumer-driven health care: just a tweak or a revolution? | journal = Health Aff (Millwood) | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 1554–58 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16284028 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.24.6.1554 | url = http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/6/1554.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] was passed, which encourages consumers to have a [[high-deductible health plan]] and a [[health savings account]].

Mental illness affects one out of six adults in the United States.

The Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 mandates that group health plans provide mental health and [[substance-related disorder]] benefits that are at least equivalent to benefits offered for medical and surgical procedures. The legislation renews and expands provisions of the [[Mental Health Parity Act]] of 1996. The law requires financial equity for annual and lifetime mental health benefits, and compels parity in treatment limits and expands all equity provisions to addiction services. Insurance companies and third-party disability administrators (most notably, Sedgwick CMS) used loopholes and, though providing financial equity, they often worked around the law by applying unequal co-payments or setting limits on the number of days spent in inpatient or outpatient treatment facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/06/washington/06health.html?_r=1 |title=House Approves Bill on Mental Health Parity |accessdate=July 29, 2009|work=The New York Times | first=Robert | last=Pear | date=March 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|drSB2JPGh8Y|"Sedgwick Ignores Medical Records and Denies Disability Benefits"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is considerable research into inequalities in health care. In some cases these inequalities are caused by income disparities that result in lack of health insurance and other barriers to receiving services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kff.org/uninsured/7705.cfm "How Trends in the Health Care System Affect Low-Income Adults: Identifying Access Problems and Financial Burdens"], Issue Brief: Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, December 21, 2007.

=== Drug efficiency and safety ===

The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/WhatFDARegulates/default.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604111232/http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/WhatFDARegulates/default.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 4, 2009|title=What FDA Regulates|date=June 4, 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the primary institution tasked with the safety and effectiveness of human and veterinary drugs. It also is responsible for making sure drug information is accurately and informatively presented to the public. The FDA reviews and approves products and establishes [[List of pharmaceutical compound number prefixes|drug labeling]], drug standards, and medical device manufacturing standards. It sets performance standards for radiation and ultrasonic equipment.

One of the more contentious issues related to drug safety is immunity from prosecution. In 2004, the FDA reversed a federal policy, arguing that FDA premarket approval overrides most claims for damages under state law for medical devices. In 2008 this was confirmed by the Supreme Court in [[Riegel v. Medtronic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp0802108|title=The FDA, Preemption, and the Supreme Court|first1=Leonard H.|last1=Glantz|first2=George J.|last2=Annas|date=May 1, 2008|publisher=|volume=358|issue=18|pages=1883–85|via=Taylor and Francis|doi=10.1056/NEJMp0802108|pmid=18450601|journal=N Engl J Med}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2006, an FDA ruling went into effect extending protection from lawsuits to pharmaceutical manufacturers, even if it was found that they submitted fraudulent clinical trial data to the FDA in their quest for approval. This left consumers who experience serious health consequences from drug use with little recourse. In 2007, the House of Representatives expressed opposition to the FDA ruling, but the Senate took no action. On March 4, 2009, an important U.S. Supreme Court decision was handed down. In [[Wyeth v. Levine]], the court asserted that state-level rights of action could not be pre-empted by federal immunity and could provide "appropriate relief for injured consumers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2008/2008_06_1249/|title=''Wyeth v.

=== Prescription drug prices ===
{{Contradicts other|date=October 2009|1=Prescription drug prices in the United States}}
{{Main|Prescription drug prices in the United States}}
During the 1990s, the price of [[prescription drugs]] became a major issue in American politics as the prices of many new drugs increased exponentially, and many citizens discovered that neither the government nor their insurer would cover the cost of such drugs. Per capita, the U.S. spends more on pharmaceuticals than any other country, although expenditures on pharmaceuticals accounts for a smaller share (13%) of total health care costs compared to an [[OECD]] average of 18% (2003 figures).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/15/23/34970246.pdf |format=PDF |title=OECD Health Data, How Does the United States Compare |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] |accessdate=April 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 25% of out-of-pocket spending by individuals is for prescription drugs.&lt;ref name="pmid15451969"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heffler S, Smith S, Keehan S, Clemens MK, Zezza M, Truffer C | title = Health spending projections through 2013 | journal = Health Aff (Millwood) | volume = Suppl Web Exclusives | issue =  | pages = W4–79–93, See especially exhibit 5 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15451969 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.w4.79 | url = http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15451969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. government has taken the position (through the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]]) that U.S. drug prices are rising because U.S. consumers are effectively subsidizing costs which drug companies cannot recover from consumers in other countries (because many other countries use their bulk-purchasing power to aggressively negotiate drug prices).&lt;ref&gt;See the summary of the official U.S. position in the [http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Trade_Sectors/Intellectual_Property/Special_301_Public_Submissions_2008/asset_upload_file109_14495.pdf "Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) Special 301 Submission of 2008"], February 11, 2008, 10–20. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121034643/http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Trade_Sectors/Intellectual_Property/Special_301_Public_Submissions_2008/asset_upload_file109_14495.pdf |date=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. position (consistent with the primary lobbying position of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America) is that the governments of such countries are [[free rider problem|free riding]] on the backs of U.S. consumers. Such governments should either deregulate their markets, or raise their domestic taxes in order to fairly compensate U.S. consumers by directly remitting the difference (between what the companies would earn in an open market versus what they are earning now) to drug companies or to the U.S. government. In turn, pharmaceutical companies would be able to continue to produce innovative pharmaceuticals while lowering prices for U.S. consumers. Currently, the U.S., as a purchaser of pharmaceuticals, negotiates some drug prices but is forbidden by law from negotiating drug prices for the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program due to the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] passed in 2003. Democrats have charged that the purpose of this provision is merely to allow the pharmaceutical industry to profiteer off of the Medicare program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/06/business/06drug.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=As Drug Prices Climb, Democrats Find Fault With Medicare Plan | first=Alex | last=Berenson | date=November 6, 2006 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Impact of drug companies ====
The U.S. is one of two countries in the world that allows [[direct-to-consumer advertising]] of prescription drugs. Critics note that drug advertisements cost money which they believe have raised the overall price of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/330/7481/5|title=Direct to consumer advertising|first1=Peter R.|last1=Mansfield|first2=Barbara|last2=Mintzes|first3=Dee|last3=Richards|first4=Les|last4=Toop|date=December 30, 2004|publisher=|journal=BMJ|volume=330|issue=7481|pages=5–6|via=www.bmj.com|doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7481.5|pmid=15626784|pmc=539827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When health care legislation was being written in 2009, the drug companies were asked to support the legislation in return for not allowing importation of drugs from foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/16/nation/la-na-health-senate16-2009dec16 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Senate healthcare bill advances with rejection of imported drugs | first1=Janet | last1=Hook | first2=Noam N. | last2=Levey | date=December 16, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---so what?

=== Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010) ===
The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (Public Law 111-148) is a health care reform bill that was signed into law in the [[United States]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] on March 23, 2010. The law includes a large number of [[Provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health-related provisions]], most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding [[Medicaid]] eligibility for people making up to 133% of [[federal poverty level|FPL]],&lt;ref name="cnn_ref1"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/03/25/health.care.law.basics/index.html |title=5 key things to remember about health care reform |publisher=CNN |date=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsidizing insurance premiums for individuals and families making up to 400% of [[federal poverty level|FPL]] and capping expenses from 2% to 9.8% of annual income.&lt;ref name=whitehouse&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/health-care-meeting/proposal/whatsnew/affordability |title= Policies to Improve Affordability and Accountability |publisher= The White House |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121230013542/http://www.whitehouse.gov/health-care-meeting/proposal/whatsnew/affordability |archivedate= December 30, 2012 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0320/Health-care-reform-bill-101-Who-gets-subsidized-insurance |title=Health Care Reform Bill 101 |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, all health policies sold in the United States must cap an individual's (or family's) medical expenses out of pocket annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcbsm.com/index/health-insurance-help/faqs/topics/how-health-insurance-works/out-of-pocket-maximums.html |title=How do out-of-pocket maximums work? &amp;#124; FAQs |website=Bcbsm.com |date= |accessdate=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other provisions include providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing [[health insurance exchange]]s, prohibiting insurers from establishing annual spending caps and support for medical research. The costs of these provisions are offset by a variety of taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for high-income [[tax bracket|brackets]], taxes on [[indoor tanning]], cuts to the [[Medicare Advantage]] program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Grier, [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0321/Health-care-reform-bill-101-Who-will-pay-for-reform Health care reform bill 101: Who will pay for reform?], ''Christian Science Monitor'' (March 21, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; there is also a tax penalty for citizens who do not obtain health insurance (unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0319/Health-care-reform-bill-101-Who-must-buy-insurance |title=Health care reform bill 101: Who must buy insurance? |last=Grier|first=Peter |date=March 19, 2010 |work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |accessdate=April 7, 2010 |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimates that the net effect (including the reconciliation act) will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143&amp;nbsp;billion over the first decade.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Budget Office, [http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=11379&amp;type=1 Cost Estimates for H.R. 4872, Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Final Health Care Legislation)] (March 20, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; However, two months later, the office subsequently acknowledged that there was an additional $115 billion in funds needed that were not originally included in the estimate. Additionally, the CBO estimated that although projected premiums in 2016 would be lower by $100 per person for small and large business health insurance plans with the Affordable Care Act than without, individual plans would be higher by $1,900 with the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manchikanti|first=Laxmaiah|date=January 2011|title=Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010: Reforming the Health Care Reform for the New Decade|url=https://www.monroecollege.edu/uploadedFiles/_Site_Assets/PDF/2011.14.E35.E67.pdf|journal=Pain Physician|volume=14|pages=E35-E67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first open enrollment period of the Affordable Care Act began in October 2013. Prior to this period, access to healthcare and insurance coverage trends were worsening on a national level. A large, national survey of American adults found that after the act's first two enrollment periods, self-reported coverage, health, and access to care improved significantly. Furthermore, insurance coverage for low-income adults were significantly greater in states that expanded Medicaid in comparison with states that did not expand Medicaid.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sommers|first1=B|date=2015|title=Changes in Self-reported Insurance Coverage, Access to Care, and Health Under the Affordable Care Act|journal=JAMA|volume=314|issue=4|pages=366–374|doi=10.1001/jama.2015.8421}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, discrepancies do exist between those covered by Medicaid versus those covered by private insurance. Those insured by Medicaid tend to report fair or poor health, as opposed to excellent or very good health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hadley|first=Jack|date=Winter 2003|title=Is Health Care Spending Higher under Medicaid or Private Insurance?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.5034/inquiryjrnl_40.4.323|journal=Inquiry|volume=40|pages=323-342|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the state of Vermont became the first state to pass legislation establishing a [[single-payer]] health care system. The legislation, known as Act 48, establishes health care in the state as a "human right" and lays the responsibility on the state to provide a health care system which best meets the needs of the citizens of Vermont. After reviewing the costs and procedures for implementing such a program, the state decided against such a measure in late 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fitzgerald |first=Jay |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/01/25/costs-derail-vermont-single-payer-health-plan/VTAEZFGpWvTen0QFahW0pO/story.html |title=Costs derail Vermont’s single-payer health plan |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=January 25, 2015 |accessdate=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2017 the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] was signed into law by President Donald Trump. Inside the final version of the bill was a repeal of the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which required individuals and companies to get healthcare for themselves and their employees. It was this mandate which kept healthcare costs down under the PPACA by promoting cost sharing over a larger pool. Economists believe the repeal of the individual mandate will lead to higher premiums and lower enrollment in the current market though they don’t agree with how much.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/us/politics/tax-cut-obamacare-individual-mandate-repeal.html|title=Without the Insurance Mandate, Health Care’s Future May Be in Doubt|last=Pear|first=Robert|date=2017-12-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the new Republican healthcare bill known as the [[American Health Care Act of 2017|American Health Care Act]] was passed by the House of Representatives under President Donald Trump. Although the Affordable Care Act and the American Health Care Act both propose tax cuts in order to make insurance more affordable for Americans; however, each of these bills affected Americans in different ways. The people most affected by President Trump’s plan are young people, individuals of a higher socioeconomic status, and people who live in urban areas. Young people because individuals between the age of 20 and 30 will see drops in the premiums they pay within their plans. Individuals with higher socioeconomic status because whereas under Obamacare individuals could only make up to $50,000 dollars annually and still receive tax breaks, now under Trump’s plan that number has been increase so that individuals who make up to $115,000 annually can receive tax breaks. In addition, those in urban areas can also benefit from the plan because under Obamacare tax credits were designated also by the cost of local healthcare, but the American Health Care Act does not take this into consideration although rural healthcare is generally more expensive due to the lack of hospitals and available services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39233010|title=Trump health bill: Winners and losers|date=2017-05-04|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health insurance coverage for immigrants ==
{{main|Immigrant health care in the United States}}
Of the 26.2 million foreign immigrants living in the US in 1998, 62.9% were non-U.S. citizens. In 1997, 34.3% of non-U.S. citizens living in America did not have health insurance coverage opposed to the 14.2% of native-born Americans who do not have health insurance coverage. Among those immigrants who became citizens, 18.5% were uninsured, as opposed to noncitizens, who are 43.6% uninsured. In each age and income group, immigrants are less likely to have health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.90.6.917|title=Health insurance coverage of immigrants living in the United States: differences by citizenship status and country of origin|date=June 1, 2000|publisher=|journal=Am J Public Health|volume=90|issue=6|pages=917–23|via=ajph.aphapublications.org (Atypon)|doi=10.2105/AJPH.90.6.917|pmid=10846509|pmc=1446276|author=Carrasquillo O, Carrasquillo AI, Shea S}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the recent healthcare changes, many legal immigrants with various immigration statuses now are able qualify for affordable health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.healthcare.gov/immigration-status-and-the-marketplace/ |title=Find out what immigration statuses qualify for coverage in the Health Insurance Marketplace. |website=HealthCare.gov |date= |accessdate=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Undocumented immigrants within the United States do not have access to government funded health insurance. Although [[The Affordable Care Act]] allows immigrants to receive insurance at a discounted rate, the same does not go for those without US citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.visitorguard.com/obamacare-for-usa-visitors-and-immigrants/#greencard|title=Obamacare: Visitors, International students, immigrants &amp; US citizens|date=December 24, 2013|newspaper=VisitorGuard.com|language=en-US|access-date=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undocumented immigrants in the US can seek medical help from community centers, or what is termed Safety Net Providers, and participate in fee for service medical assistance, but can only buy health insurance from privatized health insurers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coveredca.com/individuals-and-families/getting-covered/immigrants/|title=Health Insurance for Immigrants {{!}} Covered California™|website=www.coveredca.com|access-date=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Healthcare Denmark''', styled as '''Healthcare DENMARK''' and formerly known as {{lang-da|'''Sundheds- og Velfærdskonsortiet'''}} (The Consortium for Health and Wellbeing) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[nonprofit organization]] that works to promote international awareness of Danish health and care solutions. The overall objective of the organization is to contribute to an increased [[export]] of Danish health solutions as well as to increased innovation and foreign investment in the Danish healthcare sector.

Healthcare Denmark is headquartered in [[Odense]] and has approximately 8 employees. In addition to organizing and participating in international conferences and visits by delegations to and from Denmark, Healthcare Denmark promotes Danish healthcare expertise through initiatives in international, professional and social media, ain the foreign press and through its website, films, magazines, and presentations.

== Establishment and funding ==
Healthcare Denmark was created in 2012 as part of a plan at the ministerial level to establish seven consortia to market selected Danish positions of strength. Healthcare Denmark rests on the assumption that "[Danish] strengths in the sphere of health and care demonstrate not least a good and effective collaboration between public and private actors on solutions for tasks in the area of health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitdenmark.dk/da/danmark/sundheds-og-velfaerdskonsortiet |title=Sundheds- og Velfærdskonsortiet |website=Visit Denmark |publisher=Government of Denmark |accessdate=2016-10-14 |language=Danish |quote=Styrkepositionerne på sundheds- og velfærdsområdet skyldes ikke mindst et godt og effektivt samspil mellem det offentlige og private aktører om løsninger af velfærdsopgaver.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established based on an action plan developed by the then government and other political parties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w2l.dk/file/147139/offensiv_markedsfoering_af_danmark_2011-2012.pdf |title=Handlingsplan for offensiv global markedsføring af Danmark 2011&amp;ndash;2012 |trans-title=Action Plan for offensive in global marketing of Denmark 2011&amp;ndash;2012 |language=Danish |date=November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and funding comes partly from grants&lt;ref&gt;For example, Fonden til Markedsføring af Danmark (The Fund for Promotion of Denmark): {{cite web |url=http://mfonden.dk/stoettedeprojekter |title=Støttede projekter: Godkendte ansøgninger i 2012 |trans-title=Projects supported: Applications approved in 2012 |language=Danish |website=Fonden til Markedsføring af Danmark |publisher=[[Ministry of Economic and Business Affairs (Denmark)|Danish Ministry of Economic and Business Affairs]] |accessdate=2016-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and partly from the consortium partners.

== Partners ==
Healthcare Denmark is a public-private partnership of the Danish Ministries of [[Sundheds- og Ældreministeriet|Health]], [[Ministry of Economic and Business Affairs (Denmark)|Economic and Business Affairs]], and [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)|Foreign Affairs]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Danske Regioner|da}} (an organization of the five [[regions of Denmark]]), the [[Region of Southern Denmark]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Dansk Erhverv|da}} (the Danish [[Chamber of Commerce]]), the [[Confederation of Danish Industries]], and the companies [[Falck (Denmark)|Falck]], [[KMD (company)|KMD]], and {{Interlanguage link multi|Systematic A/S|da|3=Systematic}}. All partners are represented on Healthcare Denmark's board of directors, which is headed by Sten Scheibye.

== Patronage ==
[[Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark|Crown Princess Mary]] is the patron for Healthcare Denmark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kongehuset.dk/en/menu/news/hrh-the-crown-princess-patron-of-healthcare-denmark |title=HRH The Crown Princess patron of Healthcare Denmark |website=News: The Royal House |publisher=Danish Monarchy |date=2013-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in this capacity actively supports the consortium’s Danish and foreign activities, including conferences and large business delegations.

==Health infrastructure==
[[File:David Gordon Memorial Hospital.jpg|thumb|David Gordon Memorial Hospital in [[Livingstonia, Malawi|Livingstonia]]]]{{Original research section|date=September 2016}}
Malawi has a three-tier healthcare system in which each level is connected by a patient referral system. However the health system structure  exist in publications only where it mirrors national health systems in the West and just whilst just like other systems in Malawi, it does not function. This is largely due to  lack of manpower, lack of basic/expert skills set, overpopulation, lack of equipment/technology, corruption, lack of political commitment, lack of sufficient funds, poor prioritisation in budgeting and low motivation among personnel. According to World Health Organization Report, Malawi health system ranks number 185 out of 190. The figurative picture of the health system can be created by understanding the indicators of a failing system or the mere non existence of the system. There is no emergency systems in place for medical services, fire service or crime response (no ambulated paramedic response system (as in a 112 no 999 service)). Where there's need to obtain such services, victims are required to meet the cost. Only the very few privately run hospitals in the two major cities of Blantyre and Lilongwe have very limited non purposely built vehicles serving as basic ambulances used to transport their paying patients mostly without life saving equipment onboard or an on-board paramedic. In April 2012 the then State President suffered a cardiac arrest which resulted to his death due to lack of medication both within the presidential medical team and at the main referral hospital where he was attended to. As of 2016 Malawi has only one qualified cardiologist consultant who is based at a private hospital. Recent survey indicate that, unlike in cases of HIV, Malaria or TB, patients suffering from diseases which require expert clinical skills and equipment i.e. cardiac or neural related problems, are likely to receive wrong diagnosis and incorrect treatment or medication resulting to in unnecessarily high mortality rates. There is no provider of aeromedical service within Malawi. Malawi has the lowest ranking on health system among countries which are not affected by civil wars, however the medical services delivered still rank lower than some war torn countries. There is no national record information system for patients records. Most common medication found in hospital pharmacies in the west are not available locally i.e. treatment for the heart diseases or cancer are unavailable.  There is an uncontrolled circulation of internationally banned drugs or out-of-date drugs in flea markets.

Below is an outline of how the health system is meant to work as published by the Malawi's government department responsible for health.

Patients enter into the system at the first tier and flow to higher tier facilities as needed.&lt;ref name="WHO cooperation strategy 2008-2013, Malawi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Generation, WHO Country Cooperation Strategy, 2008-2013, Malawi|url=http://www.who.int/countryfocus/cooperation_strategy/ccs_mwi_en.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa|accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical supplies and human resources, however, flow in the opposite direction. The already limited resources are first allocated to the top tier facilities, leaving the second and third tier facilities with little to no resources.&lt;ref name="Malawi Health System"&gt;{{cite web|title=Malawi's Health and Educational Systems|url=http://seedglobalhealth.org/images/uploads/Malawis_Health_and_Educational_Systems.pdf|accessdate=2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malawi's Ministry of Health is responsible for healthcare in Malawi. 62% of health services are provided by the government, 37% are provided by the Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM), and a small fraction of the population receive health services through the private sector. Private doctors and [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) offer services and medicines for a nominal fee.&lt;ref name="Historical Dictionary of Malawi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalinga|first=Owen|title=Historical Dictionary of Malawi|year=2012|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-81085961-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The public health system has three separate tiers (primary, secondary, and tertiary care). A system of referrals links these three tiers.

[[Primary care]], "where the bulk of health care actually happens in Malawi",&lt;ref name="Dr. Richards-kortum global health book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards-Kortum|first=Rebecca|title=Biomedical Engineering for Global Health|location=5143 of 12967}}&lt;/ref&gt;   consists of community-based outreach, manned and unmanned health posts, dispensaries, urban health centers and primary health centers (including rural/community hospitals).&lt;ref name="WHO cooperation strategy 2008-2013, Malawi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Citation for chart (Malawi plan)"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Malawi National Health Plan 1999-2004|volume= 2: National Health Faciliites}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the primary level (third tier), hospitals have holding beds, post-natal beds, holding wards and are able to provide [[out-patient]], maternity, and ante-natal services.&lt;ref name="Citation for chart (Malawi plan)"/&gt;

If the patient's condition is considered to be too critical for primary care facilities to handle, they will be referred to the next level of the healthcare system.
Secondary level care is provided by district hospitals that are located in each of Malawi's 28 districts. These hospitals are equipped to provide the same basic services as the primary care facilities (mentioned above) in addition to a few more, such as: x-ray, ambulance, operating theatre and a laboratory.
The top tier of care is provided by the central hospitals located in the major urban areas. These hospitals differ from the second tier hospitals in the existence of various specialized services.&lt;ref name="Malawi Health System" /&gt;

===Health budget===
[[File:Meeting mothers and midwives (7513818110).jpg|thumb|[[Andrew Mitchell]], British [[Secretary of State for International Development]], visiting a midwifery unit in Malawi]]
According to the World Health Organization's statistics on Malawi, there has been a sharp increase in health expenditures in the past decade. From 2002 to 2011, the per capital total expenditure on health ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] int.) increased from $27.2 to $77.0 and per capita government expenditure on health (PPP int.) increased from $16.4 to $56.5.&lt;ref name="WHO malawi stat. summary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Observatory Data Repository|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.country.country-MWI|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=10 May 2013|authorlink=African Region: Malawi Statistics summar (2002-present)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These statistics indicate that the healthcare in Malawi is receiving greater attention and resource allocation. They also reflect the increased health focus of the government of Malawi. From 2002 to 2011, the percentage of total government expenditures allocated to health increased from 13% to 18.5%.&lt;ref name="WHO malawi stat. summary" /&gt;

Malawi's increased government expenditure on healthcare has coincided with a decrease in the country's dependence on external healthcare resources, such as international and non-governmental aid. In 2009 external resources were responsible for 97.4% of total health expenditures, in 2011 they were responsible for 52.4%.&lt;ref name="WHO malawi stat. summary" /&gt;  In 2017 89% of Malawian healthcare was provided through donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=David|title=Developing pharmacy in Malawi|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20202748.article|accessdate=17 July 2017|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health staffing===
In Malawi’s health profile, last updated in May 2013, the [[World Health Organization]] reported that there were only .2 physicians per 10,000 population and 3.4 nurses and [[midwives]] per 10,000 population.&lt;ref name="Malawi: Health Profile graphics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Malawi: health profile|url=http://www.who.int/gho/countries/mwi.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2013-10-15|archivedate=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Malawi's shortage of healthcare personnel is the most severe in the region. Additionally, the minimal body of health workers are not evenly distributed in the healthcare system. Challenges that lead to this shortage are low outputs of medical training institutions, health worker retention, and disease.&lt;ref name="WHO cooperation strategy 2008-2013, Malawi" /&gt;

In the 1990s Malawi stopped training auxiliary nurses and medical assistants. In 2001, this training was resumed in an effort to increase human resources for health care. In 2005, Malawi began to implement its emergency human resource program which concentrates on increasing output of trained medical personnel, improving health worker compensation and retention.&lt;ref name="WHO cooperation strategy 2008-2013, Malawi" /&gt;

In 2017 there were around 200 pharmacists in the country, of which fewer than 10 are in the country's hospitals.  Most hospitals don't have a pharmacist, and they use up their annual drug allocation in six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=David|title=Developing pharmacy in Malawi|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20202748.article|accessdate=17 July 2017|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accessibility to healthcare facilities===
Limited access to health services in Malawi affect a large number of Malawians. Only 46% of citizens live within a 5&amp;nbsp;km radius of any kind of health facility.&lt;ref name="WHO cooperation strategy 2008-2013, Malawi" /&gt; Despite most public health services being free for the patients, there are often costs associated with transportation to and from a facility.&lt;ref name="WHO cooperation strategy 2008-2013, Malawi" /&gt; These costs deter many individuals that may be in dire need of care but cannot afford to assume the costs of transportation. Additional transportation needs complicate matters when an individual is referred from either a rural hospital to a district hospital or a district hospital to a central hospital.&lt;ref name="WHO cooperation strategy 2008-2013, Malawi" /&gt;

===Government efforts for healthcare improvement===

The Ministry of Health explicitly states the goals of healthcare improvement efforts in Malawi.&lt;ref name="Malawi govt. Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Malawi Government|url=http://www.malawi.gov.mw/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=22|publisher=Government of the Republic of Malawi|accessdate=2013-10-18|authorlink=About Ministry of Health|archivedate=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Range and quality of health services for mothers children under the age of 5 years expanded
# Better quality health care provided in all facilities
# Health services to general population strengthened expanded and integrated
# Efficiency and equity in resource allocation increased
# Access to health care facilities and basic services increased
# Quality of trained human resources increased, improved equitably/efficiently distributed
# Collaboration and partnership in health sector strengthened
# Overall resources in health sector increased

These objectives have been addressed in a variety of ways. In 2002, Malawi published the Poverty Reduction Strategy which included the Essential Health Package (EHP).&lt;ref name="Malawi Health System" /&gt;  The EHP was derived from estimates of the most significant burdens of disease in Malawi provided in 2002 by the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="Bowie Book"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowie|first=Cameron|author2=Mwase|title=Assessing the use of an essential health package in a sector wide approach in Malawi|journal=Health Research Policy and Systems|year=2011|volume=9|issue=4|url=http://www.health-policy-systems.com/content/9/1/4|accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its central focus is to combat 11 health issues that most greatly affect the poor.&lt;ref name="WHO cooperation strategy 2008-2013, Malawi" /&gt;

In 2004, the government of Malawi, in collaboration with partners, developed a six-year program of work (POW) that revolved around the EHP and guided the implementation of a health sector-wide approach (SWAp). In 2007, POW transitioned to become the Health Sector Strategic Plan, effective from 2007 to 2011.&lt;ref name="WHO cooperation strategy 2008-2013, Malawi" /&gt;
Measuring the outcomes of interventions, such as those facilitated by the SWAp, is very difficult due to the absence of a vital registration system and surveys to track changes in mortality.&lt;ref name="Bowie Book"/&gt;

===Reception of global health initiative funds===
The shortage of health workers in Malawi is an obstacle to utilizing [[Global Health Initiatives]] (GHI) funds effectively.&lt;ref name="Health workforce responses to global health initiatives funding: a comparison of Malawi and Zambia"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brugha|first=Ruairí|author2=John Kadzandira |author3=Joseph Sumbaya |author4=Patrick Dicker |author5=Victor Mwapasa |author6=Aisling Walsh |title=Health workforce responses to global health initiatives funding: a comparison of Malawi and Zambia|journal=Human Resources for Health|date=11 August 2010|doi=10.1186/1478-4491-8-19|url=http://www.human-resources-health.com/content/8/1/19 |volume=8 |pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasing health services such as HIV/AIDs treatment commonly prompt an increase in the number of minimally trained health care workers and a modest increase in clinical staff members.&lt;ref name="Health workforce responses to global health initiatives funding: a comparison of Malawi and Zambia" /&gt;   According to an extensive study published in 2010, when Malawi received a large amount of GHI funding from the [[Global Fund]] to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, there was an increase in faculty and staff across all levels of the health system. This increase in paid health workers was supported by task-shifting to less trained staff.&lt;ref name="Health workforce responses to global health initiatives funding: a comparison of Malawi and Zambia" /&gt;

'''Hysterotomy abortion''' is a form of [[abortion]] in which the [[uterus]] is opened through an abdominal incision and the [[fetus]] is removed, similar to a [[caesarean section]], but requiring a smaller incision.&lt;ref name="encarta"&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761553899/Abortion.html#s3 Abortion]. (2007). ''MSN Encarta.'' Retrieved July 1, 2007. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kwr94iv9 Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; As major [[abdominal surgery]], [[hysterotomy]] is performed under [[general anaesthesia]], and is only used in rare situations where less invasive procedures have failed or are medically inadvisable (such as in the case of [[placenta accreta]]).&lt;ref name="roche"&gt;Roche, Natalie E. (June 16, 2006). [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3312.htm Surgical Management of Abortion]. Retrieved July 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

This method has the greatest risk of complications out of all the abortion procedures.&lt;ref name="roche" /&gt; Health officials in the [[United States]] warned practitioners against performing hysterotomy abortion in an [[outpatient]] setting after it led to the deaths of two women in [[New York (state)|New York]] during 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berger GS, Tietze C, Pakter J, Katz SH |title=Maternal mortality associated with legal abortion in New York State: July 1, 1970--June 30, 1972 |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=315–26 |date=March 1974 |pmid=4814448 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stroh G, Katz SH, Hinman AR |title=Performing second-trimester abortions.

[[File:Logo of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF).jpg.gif|thumb|right|x142px|alt=the logo of the International Diabetes Federation]]
The '''International Diabetes Federation (IDF)''' is a worldwide alliance of over 230 national [[diabetes]] associations in more than 160 countries, who have come together to enhance the lives of people with diabetes everywhere. The Federation is committed to raising global awareness of diabetes, promoting appropriate diabetes care and prevention, and encouraging activities towards finding a cure for the different types of diabetes. The Federation has been leading the global diabetes community since 1950. It is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium.

According to the latest IDF figures,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idf.org/diabetesatlas|title=IDF diabetes atlas - Home|website=Idf.org|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are currently 415 million people living with diabetes and the total is expected to rise to 640 million by 2040. Some 75% of people with diabetes live in low- and middle-income countries and almost half of people living with diabetes are undiagnosed.

==Organization==
IDF is divided into seven regions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idf.org/regions|title=Regions and members|website=Idf.org|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of strengthening the work of national diabetes associations and enhancing the collaboration between them. IDF’s national diabetes associations are divided into the following regions: Africa (AFR),Europe (EUR),Middle East and North Africa (MENA), North America and Caribbean (NAC), South and Central America (SACA), South East Asia (SEA) and Western Pacific (WP).

IDF’s working bodies bring together the most important stakeholders from the global diabetes community in a collaborative effort to set common goals and co-ordinate activities towards the attainment of these goals. These stakeholders include: people with diabetes and their families; professionals involved in diabetes healthcare and related fields; diabetes representative organizations, and partners from commercial organizations with concerns which align with the mission of the Federation. IDF is associated with the Department of Public Information of the United Nations and is in official relations with the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[Pan American Health Organization]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Projects and activities==
The federation conducts a number of activities and projects. These include [[advocacy]] and [[lobbying]] work, education for people with diabetes and their healthcare providers, public awareness and health improvement campaigns, as well as the promotion of the free exchange of diabetes knowledge. A few examples include:
* [[World Diabetes Day]], the primary awareness campaign of the diabetes world, marked every year on 14 November. As a result of the passage of United Nations Resolution 61/225 in December 2006, World Diabetes Day is an official United Nations day. The campaign is represented by the blue circle,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.idf.org/bluecircle |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032906/http://www.idf.org/bluecircle |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the global symbol of diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idf.org/worlddiabetesday|title=International Diabetes Federation - Home|website=Idf.org|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The World Diabetes Congress, which provides a unique and international forum to discuss a wide variety of diabetes-related topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idf.org/congress|title=International Diabetes Federation - IDF Congress|website=Idf.org|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Diabetes Atlas, a unique resource on diabetes for a wide range of audiences including decision-makers, public health authorities, healthcare professionals and educators. The next World Diabetes Congress will be held in 2015.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* BRIDGES, a programme that funds translational research projects in primary and secondary prevention of diabetes to provide the opportunity to ‘translate’ lessons learned from clinical research to those who can benefit most: people affected by diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idf.org/bridges|title=Bridges|website=Idf.org|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Life for a Child Programme, helping children with diabetes in developing countries to access the diabetes care that they require to survive. The Programme is currently helping over 12,000 children in 43 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idf.org/lifeforachild|title=IDF Life for a Child - Home|website=Idf.org|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The International Federation of Blood Donor Organizations''' (abbreviated '''IFBDO''' in English, and '''FIODS''' in French and Spanish), is an [[international organization]] whose main stated aim is self-sufficiency of the member states in [[blood]] proceeding from voluntary non-remunerated blood [[Blood donation|donors]], as well as harmonization of the security standards for [[blood donation]] and inspection processes.

IFBDO has the Participatory status with the Council of Europe, and it is Registered at United Nations' Department of Economic and Social Affairs (NGO Branch).
IFBDO is a signee of Melbourne Declaration (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Melbourne|first=Declaration|title=The Melbourne Declaration on  100% Voluntary Non‐Remunerated Donation of Blood and Blood Components|url=http://www.who.int/worldblooddonorday/Melbourne_Declaration_VNRBD_2009.pdf?ua=1|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Dublin Consensus (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dublin|first=Consensus|title=The Dublin Consensus Statement on vital issues relating to the collection of blood and plasma and the manufacture of plasma products|url=http://www.ipopi.org/uploads/Dublin%20consensus%20statement%20vox%20Sanguinis.pdf|publisher=ISBT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statutory goals==

Statutory goals:
# To promote the regular, anonymous, voluntary, non-remunerated gift of blood in all countries of the world.
# To work towards meeting the needs for high quality human blood and blood products in every country, in co-operation with the competent entities.
# To ensure that ways and means are applied guaranteeing the safety of both the donor and the receiver.
# To combat all forms of marketing and gain with respect to blood and blood derivatives, under the principle that the human body is unalienable.
# To participate in all studies, activities, discussions or events related either to the organization of blood transfusion and blood donor associations or to knowledge and research in [[blood transfusion]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=IFBDO|first=Statutes|title=Article III.

==History==

The IFBDO was founded in [[Luxembourg]] on December 4, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=IFBDO|first=-FIODS|title=IFBDO History|url=http://www.fiods.org/0000/?page_id=39|accessdate=15 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818235755/http://www.fiods.org/0000/?page_id=39|archivedate=18 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Headquarters are established in [[Monaco]]. The official languages of the Federation are [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. There are 72 member states. Each country is represented by only one national organization of blood donors. There are four types of membership in IFBDO: Active members, Associate members, Observers and Honorary members.

The Federation is governed by General Assembly and Executive Council. The two most prominent positions in the organization are ''President'' (currently occupied by Mr. Gianfranco Massaro, Italy) and ''Secretary General'' (currently held by Mr. Jean Marie Durant, France).

The IFBDO awards the ''[[Order for the International Merit of Blood]]'' distinctions to personalities who made a special contribution to the success of its objectives by their dedication and their skills.

IFBDO instituted a solidarity foundation (''IFBDO Solidarity Foundation'') aimed to support Federation members with international co-operation programs.

Since 1995 IFBDO had been organizing International Blood Donor Day as a particular initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United Nations Regional Information Centre for Western Europe|title=World Blood Donor Day (14 June)|url=http://www.unric.org/en/latest-un-buzz/26712-14-june-is-world-blood-donor-day|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2002 IFBDO started negotiations with the three most important international organizations who promote blood donation: [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRCS) and the [[International Society of Blood Transfusion]] (ISBT), as a result of which in 2004 all four organizations signed an agreement establishing the [[World Blood Donor Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=wbdd.org|title=Making the Most of World Blood Donor Day|url=http://www.who.int/worldblooddonorday/resources/making_the_most_of_wbdd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the [[World Health Assembly]] in 2005, the ministers of health of all WHO member states unanimously adopted a resolution that recognized voluntary non-remunerated blood donors as the cornerstone of a safe, adequate and sustainable blood supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|title=World Blood Donor Day|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/health/blood-services/world-blood-donor-day/|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then “World Blood Donor Day” is celebrated on June 14 every year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines&amp;HealthCare|first=Council of Europe|title=World Blood Donor Day|url=http://www.edqm.eu/en/World-Blood-Donor-Day-1381.html|accessdate=15 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815000925/http://www.edqm.eu/en/World-Blood-Donor-Day-1381.html|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is sponsored by the founding partners - IFBDO, WHO, IFRCS and ISBT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=World Health Organization|first=Programmes and Projects|title=Voluntary Non-Remunerated Blood Donation|url=http://www.who.int/bloodsafety/voluntary_donation/en/|publisher=WHO|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine''' is a fixed dose combination drug treatment specifically approved by the US FDA to be used to treat [[African Americans]] with [[congestive heart failure]].  It is a combination of [[hydralazine]] (an [[antihypertensive]]) and [[isosorbide dinitrate]] (a [[vasodilator]]).&lt;ref name=Ferdinand2014rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferdinand|first1=KC|last2=Elkayam|first2=U|last3=Mancini|first3=D|last4=Ofili|first4=E|last5=Piña|first5=I|last6=Anand|first6=I|last7=Feldman|first7=AM|last8=McNamara|first8=D|last9=Leggett|first9=C|title=Use of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine in African-Americans with heart failure 9 years after the African-American Heart Failure Trial.|journal=The American Journal of Cardiology|date=1 July 2014|volume=114|issue=1|pages=151–9|pmid=24846808|url=http://www.ajconline.org/article/S0002-9149(14)00975-8/pdf|doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2014.04.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the first [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]-based [[prescription drug]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=What's the Use of Race?: Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference |editor1-last=Whitmarsh |editor1-first=Ian |editor2-last=Jones |editor2-first=David S. |year=2010 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge (MA) |isbn=978-0-262-51424-8 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262514248_sch_0001.pdf| laysummary=http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_111448.asp |laydate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}

The combination preparation is marketed in the United States under the trade name '''BiDil''' by [[Arbor Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]] which purchased the rights to market the drug in December 2011 from NitroMed.

==Background==

From 1980 to 1985 Dr. Jay Cohn of the University of Minnesota led a clinical trial in collaboration with the US [[Veterans Administration]] called the Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT I) that tested whether the combination of  Isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine increased survival in patients with heart failure; the results were promising and the study was followed by V-HeFT II, which tested the combination against [[enalapril]].&lt;ref name=Kahn&gt;Jonathan Kahn.  BiDil and Racialized Medicine.  Chapter 7 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=OVg4AAAAQBAJ Race and the Genetic Revolution: Science, Myth, and Culture], Eds Sheldon Krimsky and Kathleen Sloan. Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-231-52769-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the meantime, Cohn applied for a patent on the combination treatment, which issued in 1989 as US Patent 4868179.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US4868179 US4868179]&lt;/ref&gt;  Cohn licensed the patent to a company called Medco, and Medco spent the early 1990s preparing a [[New Drug Application]] (NDA) to get the FDA to approve BiDil on the basis of the V-HeFT trials. However, the trials were not designed to support an NDA, and in 1997 the FDA rejected the application because it did not have enough [[statistical power]] to show whether the combination really worked.&lt;ref name=Kahn/&gt;

Cohn re-analyzed the data and found a signal that the drug combination appeared to work better in self-identified African-Americans in the V-HeFT trial, and published a paper on that work, and filed a new patent on the use of BiDil in "black" patients.&lt;ref name=Kahn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson P, et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10496190 Racial differences in response to therapy for heart failure: analysis of the vasodilator-heart failure trials. Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial Study Group] J Card Fail. 1999 Sep;5(3):178-87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US6465463 US Patent 6465463]&lt;/ref&gt;   It had already been known that African-Americans with congestive heart failure (CHF) respond less effectively to conventional CHF treatments (particularly [[ACE inhibitor]]s) than caucasians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200105033441802 |vauthors=Exner DV, Dries DL, Domanski MJ, Cohn JN | title = Lesser response to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor therapy in blacks as compared with white patients with left ventricular dysfunction | journal = [[N Engl J Med]] | year = 2001 | volume = 344 | issue = 18 | pages = 1351–7 | pmid = 11333991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new patent and the old patent were licensed to a company called NitroMed, which ran a clinical called the African-American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT), the results of which were published in 2004 in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Taylor AL, Ziesche S, Yancy C, Carson P, ((D'Agostino R Jr)), Ferdinand K, Taylor M, Adams K, Sabolinski M, Worcel M, Cohn JN | title = Combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine in blacks with heart failure | journal = N Engl J Med | year = 2004 | volume = 351 | pages = 2049–57 | pmid = 15533851 | issue = 20 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa042934|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa042934#t=article}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The clinical trial was stopped early because the drug worked so well; it reduced mortality by 43%, reduced hospitalizations by 39%, and improved quality of life markers in African-American patients with CHF.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

On the basis of A-HeFT, the FDA approved BiDil in June 2005.&lt;ref name=Kahn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Overview&amp;DrugName=BIDIL FDA approval process page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2005/NEW01190.html FDA approval press release]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, the Heart Failure Society of America included the use of the fixed dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine as the standard of care in the treatment of heart failure in blacks.&lt;ref&gt;Heart Failure Society of America. [http://www.ancecardio.it/it/doc/1160866289744_hfsa_2006_comprehensive_heart_failure_guidelines.pdf HFSA 2006 Comprehensive Heart Failure Practice Guideline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728080810/http://www.ancecardio.it/it/doc/1160866289744_hfsa_2006_comprehensive_heart_failure_guidelines.pdf |date=2011-07-28 }} 
J Card Fail. 2006 Feb;12(1):e1-e122.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|e44}}

Though BiDil must still be taken three times daily, as must the component pills in separate ISDN-H treatment, the reduction in pill burden has been suggested to improve compliance, and thus a better medical outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.theheart.org/article/759547/print.do|title=BiDil, regulatory milestone but a tough sell for insurers and patients, charts uncertain course|author=Steve Stiles|date=13 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

The new drug application claiming treatment of a single, self-identified racial group raised a storm of controversy. Some hailed the development of BiDil as a breakthrough for African Americans (such groups included the Black congressional Caucus, the Association of Black Cardiologists, the National Medical Association, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and a step to addressing the unique health care needs and [[Race and health in the United States#African-Americans|health disparities of the African American community]].&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Dorothy Roberts.  The Color Coded Pill.  Chapter 8 in [https://books.google.com/books/about/Fatal_Invention.html?id=_TsaXOpTCSYC Fatal Invention: How Science, Politics, and Big Business Re-create Race in the Twenty-first Century]. The New Press. {{ISBN|978-1-595-58834-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others who criticized the preliminary studies argued that the original study did not have a significant number of African-American subjects to make the BiDil's race specific claims,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 2011, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; and that the results of only one clinical trial where African-Americans were tested does not provide a full and comprehensive study.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 2011, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, critics argued that self-identified racial identifications from patients as an indicator for race during the trials were not a sufficient categorization method because these self-identifications were socially constructed and have no biological connection to genomic data.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 2011, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

They argued that the trials represented a new form of scientific racism where race, a socially constructed category, would continue to be present in research as a placeholder for genomic identification.&lt;ref name=Kahn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2008/11/28/segments/113776 WNYC ''Radiolab'' audio story about racial issues surrounding Bidil]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Editors, Scientific American.

Additionally, some disagreed with the design of the A-HeFT trial because the trial failed to include any non-African American test subjects.&lt;ref name="Puckrein2006"&gt;Puckrein, G. (2006).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2541">[[Image:Vesalius Fabrica p190.jpg|right|thumb|Jan van Calcar is assumed to have been the illustrator of Vesalius's ''Fabrica'' which contained many intricately detailed drawings of human dissections, often in allegorical poses.]]

'''Jan Steven van Calcar''' ({{lang-it|Giovanni da Calcar}}, {{lang-la|Ioannes Stephanus Calcarensis}}) (c. 1499–1546) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Italy|Italian]] painter.

==Life==
Calcar was born in the Duchy of [[Kleve|Cleves]] sometime between 1499 and 1510. [[Vasari]] refers to him several times, mainly with respect to his having been a pupil of [[Titian]]. Calcar entered Titian's school in 1536 and was accepted to his faculty for his extraordinarily accurate copies of the works of that master. Calcar appears to have worked first at Dordrecht, but the greater part of his life was spent at Naples, and there, as Vasari tells us, "the fairest hopes had been conceived respecting his future progress".&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, George. "Jan Stephanus van Kalcker". The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[Giorgio Vasari]], [[Carel van Mander]], and others credit Calcar with the eleven large [[woodcut]] illustrations of anatomical studies which accompanied [[Vesalius|Andreas Vesalius's]] work on anatomy. The most notable among these is the anatomical study of the human body entitled ''[[De humani corporis fabrica libri septem]]'' or ''On the Fabric of the Human Body in Seven Books'' (1543).

Calcar is also said to have drawn the portraits of the artists in the early edition of Vasari's ''Lives''. By some writers he has been declared to have been a close imitator of [[Giorgione]]; all who write about him unite in stating that his imitations of the works of the great Venetian artists, and also of [[Raphael]], were so extraordinary that they deceived many critics of the day. His pictures are to be seen in Berlin, Paris, Florence, Vienna, and Prague, and his original works are, as a rule, portraits, although at Prague there is a remarkable "Nativity" by him, which was once the property of Rubens.

'''John Robert "Jack" Cunningham''', [[Order of Canada|O.C.]] (born 1927) is a [[Canadian]] retired [[medical physicist]] noted for his contributions in the development of computerized [[radiation treatment planning]] dose calculations in [[radiation therapy]].

Cunningham, known as Jack, received his B.Eng. in Engineering Physics (1950) and M.Sc. in Radiation Physics (1951) from the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in [[Saskatoon]]. In 1955 he completed his Ph.D. from the [[University of Toronto]] in Physics. After working for the Canada's Defense Research Board, he became a staff [[Medical Physicist]] at Toronto's Ontario Cancer Institute / [[Princess Margaret Cancer Centre]] in 1958.

During his medical physics career, Cunningham published over 70 peer-reviewed papers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PubMed Search for JR Cunningham|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Cunningham%20JR%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=2722584|website=NCBI|publisher=PubMed|accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; book chapters, and conference proceedings, and is widely known for co-authoring ''The Physics of Radiology'' (1953) with Dr. [[Harold E. Johns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johns &amp; Cunningham|title=Physics of Radiology|date=1983|publisher=Charles C Thomas|location=USA|isbn=0-398-04669-7|edition=4|url=https://www.amazon.com/Physics-Radiology-Fourth-Harold-Elford/dp/0398046697|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final fourth edition (1983) remains a staple in medical physics education for medical physicists, technologists, and physicians. He is a pioneer in developing computational techniques for calculating absorbed dose from radiation beams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cunningham|first1=JR|title=Development of computer algorithms for radiation treatment planning.|journal=Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys.|date=1989|volume=16|issue=6|pages=1367–76|pmid=2722584}}&lt;/ref&gt; and computer software and algorithms he developed continue to be used in both commercial and open source treatment planning systems. Upon retirement from clinical medical physics in 1989, Cunningham became a consultant with Theratronics/MDS Nordion (Kanata, Ontario) until 1998 when he moved to Camrose Alberta.

In 1988 he was awarded the highest award given by the [[American Association of Physicists in Medicine]], the William D. Coolidge Award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Coolidge Award, AAPM|url=http://www.aapm.org/org/history/coolidge.asp|website=American Association of Medical Physicists|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his contributions to the field. In 2005, Cunningham was inducted as an [[Order of Canada|Officer of the Order of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cunningham|first1=John|title=Officer of the Order of Canada|url=http://www.gg.ca/honour.aspx?id=10620&amp;t=12&amp;ln=Cunningham|publisher=Governor General}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he received the Canadian Organization of Medical Physicists Gold Medal Award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cunningham|first1=JR|title=COMP Gold Medal Recipients|url=https://www.comp-ocpm.ca/english/about-comp/awards/the-comp-gold-medal.html|website=COMP-OCMP|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for "outstanding contribution[s] to the field of medical physics in Canada".

He is an Adjunct Professor at the [[University of Alberta]] in [[Edmonton]] and regularly lectures at the [[Cross Cancer Institute]] in the Department of Medical Physics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4249">'''King–Kopetzky syndrome''' is an auditory disability characterised by difficulty in hearing speech in the presence of background noise&lt;ref name="PubMed"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borg E, Stephens D |title=King-Kopetzky syndrome in the light of an ecological conceptual framework |journal=Int J Audiol |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=312–8 |date=September 2003 |pmid=14570238 |doi=10.3109/14992020309101323 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with the finding of normal hearing test results.

It is an example of  [[auditory processing disorder]] (APD) &lt;ref name="therole"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stephens D, Zhao F |title=The role of a family history in King Kopetzky Syndrome (obscure auditory dysfunction) |journal=Acta Otolaryngol. |volume=120 |issue=2 |pages=197–200 |date=March 2000 |pmid=11603771 |doi=10.1080/000164800750000900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''auditory disability with normal hearing (ADN)''.

King–Kopetzky syndrome patients have a worse [[Social Hearing Handicap index]] (SHHI) than others, indicating they suffer a significant degree of speech-hearing disability.&lt;ref name="det"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhao F, Stephens D |title=Determinants of speech-hearing disability in King-Kopetzky syndrome |journal=Scand Audiol |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=91–6 |year=1996 |pmid=8738633 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The condition is named after Samuel J. Kopetzky, who first described the condition  in 1948, and P. F. King, who first discussed the aetiological factors behind it in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.noiseandhealth.org/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=2003;volume=5;issue=20;spage=55;epage=62;aulast=Stephens|title = Is there an association between noise exposure and King Kopetzky Syndrome?|journal = Noise and Health|accessdate = 31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
It seems that somatic anxiety and situations of stress may be determinants of speech-hearing disability.&lt;ref name="det"/&gt;&lt;ref name="audpsy"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=King K, Stephens D |title=Auditory and psychological factors in 'auditory disability with normal hearing' |journal=Scand Audiol |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=109–14 |year=1992 |pmid=1641572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies indicated an increased prevalence of a family history of hearing impairment in these patients. The pattern of results is suggestive that King-Kopetzky patients may be related to conditions of autosomal dominant inheritance.&lt;ref name="therole"/&gt;&lt;ref name="audcon"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu XZ, Xu L, Newton V |title=Audiometric configuration in non-syndromic genetic hearing loss |journal=J Audiol Med |volume=3 |pages=99–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="non"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Camp G, Willems PJ, Smith RJ |title=Non-syndromic hearing impairment: unparalleled heterogeneity |journal=Am J Genet |volume=60 |pages=758–64 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
===Subcategories===

It was found that based on sensitized measures of auditory dysfunction and on psychological assessment, Subjects could be  subdivided into seven subcategories:&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhao F, Stephens D |title=Subcategories of patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome |journal=Br J Audiol |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=241–56 |date=August 2000 |pmid=10997453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#middle ear dysfunction
#mild cochlear pathology
#central/medial olivocochlear efferent system (MOCS) auditory dysfunction
#purely psychological problems
#multiple auditory pathologies
#combined auditory dysfunction and psychological problems
#unknown

Different subgroups may represent different pathogenic and aetiological factors. Thus, subcategorization provides further understanding of the basis of King–Kopetzky syndrome, and hence may guide the rehabilitative management of these patients.This was suggested  by Professor [[Dafydd Stephens]] and F Zhao at the Welsh Hearing Institute, [[Cardiff University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03005364000000134 Subcategories of Patients with King-Kopetzky Syndrome]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''medical director''' is a [[physician]] who provides guidance and leadership on the use of medicine in a healthcare organization. These include the [[emergency medical services]], [[hospital]] departments, [[blood banks]], clinical teaching services and others. A medical director devises the protocols and guidelines for the clinical staff and evaluates them while they are in use.

==Emergency medical services==
The role of a medical director in the [[emergency medical services]] (EMS) varies by which type of system is in use.

===Franco-German model===
The first model, arguably the oldest, is generally described as the Franco-German model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dick WF |title=Anglo-American vs. Franco-German emergency medical services system |journal=Prehosp Disaster Med |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=29–35; discussion 35–7 |year=2003 |pmid=14694898 |doi= 10.1017/s1049023x00000650|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model is physician-led, and those personnel who serve emergencies from ambulances are often place in minor, supporting roles. There is ample evidence indicating that at the turn of the 20th century, many [[North American]] hospital-based ambulances in larger centres were staffed by '''ambulance surgeons'''; physicians who responded in the ambulance and provided care in a manner which very much resembles the current Franco-German model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/02/19/101833251.pdf|title=Ambulance Surgeon Defended by Superior (N.Y. Times article, dated 19.02.1906)|accessdate=2008-11-26 | format=PDF | work=The New York Times | date=1906-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[France|French]] version of the model, only physicians and [[nurses]] perform advanced care, and ambulance drivers have only minimal medical training.

In the [[Germany|German]] version of the model, there are paramedics (called ''Rettungsassistenten'').  Medical control is [[on-line medical control|on-line]], immediate, and direct. The training of the Rettungsassistent is comparable to that of many North American paramedics, but they may be limited in their scope of practice. Paramedics may practice [[advanced life support]] skills at all times when the physician with whom they work is physically present. In some cases they are restricted in action if there is no physician present, a legal position mostly claimed by the physicians' lobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cooke MW, Bridge P, Wilson S |title=Variation in emergency ambulance dispatch in Western Europe|journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Trauma and Emergency Medicine|volume=9|issue=2|pages=57–66|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under German law, unless an immediately life-threatening or potentially debilitating emergency is present, such individuals may be limited to [[basic life support]] skills only, or to restricted ALS skills, which are defined in the "Standing Orders" of the Medical Director of each respective county. In 2003, there was a reform movement to expand the "standing competency", especially in the realm of pain treatment, by offering additional training to the level of "Notfallsanitaeter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dick WF |title=Anglo-American vs. Franco-German emergency medical services system |journal=Prehosp Disaster Med |volume=18 |issue=1 |page=33|year=2003 |pmid=14694898 |doi= 10.1017/s1049023x00000650|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model is intended to bring physician-centred definitive care to the patient, rather than bringing the patient to the care.  As a result, in addition to conventional ambulances, most communities have physicians (called ''Notarzt'') who respond directly to every life-threatening call to provide care.  This system does not recognize [[emergency medicine]] as a [[medical specialty]], in the sense that North Americans understand it.  In these cases, the 'emergency physician' is most commonly an [[anesthetist]], or sometimes an [[internist]] or a [[surgeon]].  In most areas of Europe, there appears to be little interest in developing emergency medicine as a [[specialty (medicine)|specialty]], although recent developments in [[Italy]] suggest that this attitude may be changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acep.org/pressroom.aspx?id=30618|title=American Emergency Physicians Create Italian Emergency Medicine Program (ACEP website)|accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this model, long 'at scene' times are common. The physician attempts to provide some or all of the intervention that is necessary in place, with transportation to hospital occurring only for those with a legitimate need of a hospital bed, and urgent transportation to hospital being extremely rare.  Many patients will never be transported to hospital.  In the French version of this model, even the triage of incoming requests for service is physician-led, with a physician, assisted by others, interviewing the caller and determining what type of response resource, if any, will be sent.  The German version of this model uses 'conventional' dispatch processes, with the physician being sent to calls as requested by the [[Emergency Medical Dispatcher|EMS dispatcher]].

The Franco-German model operates in most places in [[Europe]] and [[Russia]], but not in the [[United Kingdom]].  In this model, the medical director is typically more of a leader of physicians, and an advisor on the training of, and quality control for, subordinate staff. In Germany, the term ''Ärztlicher Leiter Rettungsdienst'' is used. This physician's role is to oversee [[Emergency medical services in Germany|EMS personnel]] in a defined area, typically a bigger [[city]] or [[county]], and it corresponds to the position of medical director in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/page.asp?his=0.7.47.3215#Definition German Federal Board of Physicians: Guidelines for the Medical director EMS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702084244/http://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/page.asp?his=0.7.47.3215 |date=2007-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglo-American===
The Anglo-American model of care is largely led by the medical director. This model has evolved significantly since its origins in the late 1960s.  The development of this role, the professionalization of emergency medical services, the profession of paramedic, and the [[medical specialty]] of emergency medicine, have all developed in a [[symbiotic]] relationship since the early years. Prior to 1979, there was no formal specialty training [[certification]] for emergency medicine. Prior to 1970, there was no concerted effort to formally train physicians in its practice in the U.S. In the [[U.K.]], formal [[consultancies]] in Emergency Medicine had existed for at least two decades before that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History Of Accident And Emergency Medicine, 1948-2004 |last=Guly |first=Henry |year=2005 |publisher=Palgrave |location= |isbn=1-4039-4715-5 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Anglo-American model of care, the physician remains the leader of the care team, but paramedics function much more independently than in the Franco-German model.  This has not always been the case. In the earliest days of paramedicine, paramedics were required to contact a physician for formal orders for each intervention that they performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kuehl, Alexander |title=Prehospital systems and medical oversight |publisher=Kendall/Hunt Pub |location=Dubugue, Iowa |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-7872-7071-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some specialists believed this was the only safe approach to providing care in this fashion. In some early cases, 'paramedics' operated blindly, providing medications from numbered or colour-coded [[syringes]] as they were directed by the physician, with no real understanding of the actions they were performing.  Control was absolute and immediate; there were examples of paramedics being trained, but not legally permitted to perform their skills, or in other cases, they could take action only with a physician or nurse present, much like the existing Franco-German model.  In the earliest stages of paramedicine, the paramedics were not yet formally licenses and often served as an extension of the physician's [[medical license]]. The [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[province]] of [[Ontario]] continues to have such a system, as of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90a19_e.htm|title=Ambulance Act (Ontario legislation)|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the training, knowledge and skill level of paramedics increased, [[licensing]] and [[certification]] were formalized, and physicians became more comfortable in working with this new profession; then paramedics were permitted greater degrees of independent practice.  In the 21st century, most paramedics function based on complex written [[Medical guideline|protocols]] or [[wikt:standing order|standing order]]s committed to memory, often numerous pages in length, and contact a physician only when standing orders have been exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Victoria L. Fedor |author2=Jacob L. Hafter |title=EMS and the Law |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |location=Sudbury, Mass |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-7637-2068-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In such systems, the medical director's role takes on several aspects. To begin with, the medical director is much more a leader of paramedics than of other physicians. They generally perform a leadership role among the small group of physicians tasked with providing [[delegation]] to paramedics in the field.

The medical director plays a key role in the professional development of paramedics as well. In almost all cases, the medical director will have, at a minimum, input into the curriculum of paramedic training at a local level. In a great many cases, they will also teach some portions of the program, supervise clinical rotations of paramedics, and in some cases, precept their initial field practice, prior to formal certification or licensing. In almost all cases, the medical director will be charged with the creation of all protocols and standing orders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgprotocols.com/amiodarone.html |title=Paramedic Protocols, Denver (Co) |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315022311/http://www.dgprotocols.com/amiodarone.html |archivedate=March 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and with any research that goes into their creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingstonbasehospital.ca/standing_orders.asp |title=Standing Orders (Kingston, Ontario Base Hospital program) |accessdate=2008-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007100141/http://www.kingstonbasehospital.ca/standing_orders.asp |archivedate=October 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The medical director will also, assisted by others, be responsible for the creation and development of the Standards of Practice for their EMS system. Throughout the paramedic's career, the medical director will provide the mechanism for medical [[quality control]], conducting [[chart]] [[audits]] and reviewing medically related service complaints, and may often have the ability to de-certify individual paramedics for cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caco.cupe.ca/www/s427f43cb4dfa8/Court_Rules_in_Case_|title=Court Rules in Case of Decertified Paramedic (Cdn Union of Public Employees website)|accessdate=2008-11-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706174545/http://www.caco.cupe.ca/www/s427f43cb4dfa8/Court_Rules_in_Case_|archivedate=2011-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical directors will also act as [[advocates]] for their paramedics, advising [[elected officials]] and building support within the medical community for expanded scopes of practice when appropriate. Finally, medical directors will act as expert advisors to those in the EMS system administration and government administration, with respect to policies and legislation required by the EMS system, and in guiding its future direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsrh.on.ca/portal/desktopdefault2.aspx?tabIndex=25&amp;tabid=119 |title=About the Program (Sudbury, Ontario Base Hospital website) |accessdate=2008-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513142029/http://www.hrsrh.on.ca/Portal/desktopdefault2.aspx?tabIndex=25&amp;tabid=119 |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the paramedic is very much seen as an 'extender' of the emergency physician's reach. It is rare to see physicians in the field, unless they are precepting new paramedics or performing quality assurance activities, or are residents in emergency medicine training programs, gaining required field experience or conducting research. Medical directors and ED physicians will occasionally go into the field for large incidents, such as multi victim accidents and disasters to assume on site medical command.

===Autonomous practice===
In some parts of the world, most notably the U.K.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Woollard M|title=Paramedic practitioners and emergency admissions|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=335 |issue=7626|pages=893–894|date=October 2007|pmid=17916812|pmc=2048876|doi=10.1136/bmj.39356.700139.BE|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://convention.ambulance.net.au/intranet/docs/doc4195.pdf |title=The Rural and Regional Paramedic: Moving Beyond Emergency Response |accessdate=2008-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718214713/http://convention.ambulance.net.au/intranet/docs/doc4195.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[South Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpcsa.co.za/hpcsa/UserFiles/File/Emergency%20Care/41887%20Adv%20Life%20SupportLR.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070727210823/http://www.hpcsa.co.za/hpcsa/UserFiles/File/Emergency%20Care/41887%20Adv%20Life%20SupportLR.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-07-27|title=Advanced Life Support Practitioner (Health Professions Council of South Africa website)|accessdate=2008-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some paramedics have evolved into a role of autonomous practitioners in their own right.  In such cases, individual paramedics may function in much the same manner as [[Physician assistants]] or [[Nurse Practitioners]], assessing patients and making their own [[diagnoses]], clinical judgments, and treatment decisions.  In all such cases, a [[scope of practice]] is predetermined for the role, and within that scope of practice all treatment decisions are made and care rendered at the discretion of the individual paramedic.  In many cases, the scope of practice will focus more heavily on [[primary care]], although providing a more comprehensive level of care, such as [[suturing]], or the management of long-term conditions, such as [[diabetes]] or [[hypertension]], than is normally permitted to the paramedic.  In some jurisdictions, such practitioners even have the authority to both [[medical prescription|prescribe]] and dispense a limited and defined set of [[medications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/Default.aspx?Id=414|title=Emergency Care Practitioners (NHS website)|accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In such circumstances, these '''Paramedic Practitioners''' or '''Emergency Care Practitioners''' are almost always very senior and experienced ALS providers, and retain their ability to practice these skills.  In many cases, the practice of these individuals has gone well beyond what we normally consider to be the role of traditional EMS.  There are locations in which these practitioners are providing E/R leadership after hours in small, rural hospitals (Australia and the U.K.), while in other locations these practitioners are actually taking night 'call' for group medical practices (U.K.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staffnurse.com/nursing-job-vacancies/emergency-care-practitioner-34737.html|title=Emergency Care Practitioner (staffnurse.com website)|accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, the Practitioner retains the ability to summon a physician to the patient when the limits of the scope of practice are reached (U.K.) while in others, the finite limits of treatment are those within that scope of practice, and no physician 'back-up' is normally provided (South Africa).

In this type of model, the role of the medical director includes the teaching of the practitioners, in both the classroom and the clinical setting.  Most such training programs tend to feature very large components of hands-on clinical experience, generally conducted in the [[emergency room]] or similar environment, and usually in a one-to-one ratio with the physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhamb.nhs.uk/ecpDocs/pdf/10_1.pdf |title=Emergency Care Practitioner |accessdate=2008-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202105548/http://www.bhamb.nhs.uk/ecpDocs/pdf/10_1.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The medical director will be responsible for examination of the candidate and certification of their ability to practice safely.  The medical director will have a major role in determining the permitted scope of practice, and will investigate practice-related complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/policy/2006/competence-curriculum-framework.php |title=Competence and curriculum framework for the emergency care practitioner (Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh website) |accessdate=2008-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525082632/http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/policy/2006/competence-curriculum-framework.php |archivedate=2011-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some jurisdictions the medical director will be responsible for medical quality assurance, although there are some where this function is performed by the practitioners themselves.  Finally, the medical director (or other emergency physicians) may be responsible for providing the required medical 'back up' when the practitioner reaches the limit of their scope of practice.

===Crossover models===
There are some models, most notably the [[Netherlands]], which use a blend of a number of these models, including the Franco-German, Anglo-American, and Autonomous Practice models.  In Netherlands, for example, all paramedics are in fact [[registered nurses]] with one year of additional training, usually in [[anesthesia]] but other [[Intensive-care medicine|critical care]] training is also acceptable, who then complete an additional year of training in ambulance care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wulterkens D |title=EMS in the Netherlands: A Dutch Treat? |journal=Journal of Emergency Medical Services |date=2005-12-06 |url=http://www.jems.com/news_and_articles/articles/EMS_in_The_Netherlands.html |trans-title=2009-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204155303/http://jems.com/news_and_articles/articles/EMS_in_The_Netherlands.html |archivedate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  All such individuals are licensed by the '''Dutch Ambulance Institute'''(DIA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambulancezorgnederland.nl/|title=Dutch Ambulance Institute website|accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are employed by one of approximately 45 private companies providing emergency ambulance service under government contract.

The model looks very much Anglo-American on its surface, however, in most cases Dutch paramedics are for all practical purposes autonomous practitioners.  The scope of practice and permissible procedures are determined at a national level by the Dutch Ambulance Institute, and all paramedics must function within this guidance.  Within the scope of practice, however, all judgment and treatment decisions fall to the paramedic, as in the Autonomous Practitioner model.  Each ambulance service is required to employ a '''medical manager''' whose role is oversight and quality assurance, and who may be contacted for directions by any paramedic who has reached the limits of their scope of practice, just as in the Anglo-American model.  When necessary, however, the paramedic may request a rapid response by a physician, usually by either vehicle or helicopter.  In these cases, a great deal of emergency intervention will occur on the scene, with the patient transported ultimately by land ambulance, as in the Franco-German model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umcg.nl/azg/nl/english/azg/|title=University of Groningen Mobile Medical Team|accessdate=2008-09-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080601034111/http://www.umcg.nl/azg/nl/english/azg/ |archivedate = June 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this model, which is unique, the role of the Medical Director is substantially different.  Scope of practice and all treatment protocols are developed by the Dutch Ambulance Institute on a national basis, and cannot be unilaterally changed at the local level by individual physicians.  Scope and protocols are reviewed, revised, and announced every four years, and any physician who wishes a change to those protocols must provide sound reasons and present a successful argument before a committee of the DIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dib JE, Naderi S, Sheridan IA, Alagappan K |title=Analysis and applicability of the Dutch EMS system into countries developing EMS systems |journal=J Emerg Med |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=111–5 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16434351 |doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2005.05.014|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The medical managers for each private carrier operate in a role approximating that of Medical Director, but only for that one company; their authority does not extend to other companies operating in the same community.  These individuals do perform quality service functions such as chart audits and complaint investigation, but they cannot unilaterally change treatment protocols.  They may provide guidance, advice and direction to paramedics by telephone or radio, or they may attend the scene in person to provide care.  The Dutch system also operates a network of four helicopters staffed by physicians for rapid response to support paramedics in the field.  While many of the individuals working in the Dutch system may be occasionally described as 'emergency physicians', the majority, as in the Franco-German model, are actually anesthetists.

{{nihongo|'''Michihiko Hachiya'''|蜂谷道彦|Hachiya Michihiko|extra=1903 in [[Okayama Prefecture]] - 1980}} was a [[Japan]]ese medical practitioner who survived the [[Hiroshima]] bombing in 1945 and kept a diary of his experience. He was Director of the Hiroshima Communications Hospital and lived near the hospital, about a mile from the explosion's center. A 1984 editorial in the ''Journal of American Medical Association'', indicates "At the urging of friends, Dr. Hachiya first published his diary in a small Japanese-language medical journal (''Teishin Igaku'') that circulated among medical members of the Japanese communications services. There it came to the attention of Warner Wells, MD, an American physician who was working in Japan in 1950 as a surgical consultant to the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission."  It was Dr. Wells, who in consultation with Dr. Hachiya, made the diary to be published in 1955, under the name of ''Hiroshima Diary''.

==During, and post bombing life==

Hachiya's diary cover the period from Aug. 6, 1945 to Sept. 30, 1945. He described the effects of the [[atomic bomb]] blast from its first flash in the early morning as he rested from his night shift as an air warden at the hospital. The force of the blast stripped all the clothes from his body but he and his wife survived, however they both received serious burns to their bodies and had to journey to the hospital Michihiko worked at. When Michihiko returned to the hospital that he worked in, the [[Hiroshima Communications Hospital]], he spent the night in the care of the hospital staff who were not seriously injured. After his injuries healed, Michihiko started making his daily rounds that he would have normally made as a doctor. The staff and patients at the hospital call the atomic bomb that hit their city "pikadon". ''Pika'' describes a flash of light and ''don'' describes an explosive sound. As time passes an understanding of what hit their city clears up, and historical events such as the [[surrender of Japan]] are brought up. The condition of the hospital also drastically improves as more medical supplies are brought into the city, allowing them to better treat patients. After the bombing he wrote the book ''The Hiroshima Diary''. This book describes what happened to him and what he saw.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3839">'''Mitotic catastrophe''' refers to a mechanism of delayed mitosis-linked [[cell death]], a sequence of events resulting from premature or inappropriate entry of cells into [[mitosis]] that can be caused by chemical or physical stresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ianzini F, Mackey MA | title = Spontaneous premature chromosome condensation and mitotic catastrophe following irradiation of HeLa S3 cells | journal = International Journal of Radiation Biology | volume = 72 | issue = 4 | pages = 409–21 | date = October 1997 | pmid = 9343106 | doi = 10.1080/095530097143185 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitotic catastrophe is unrelated to programmed [[cell death]] or [[apoptosis]] and is observed in cells lacking functional apoptotic pathways.&lt;ref name="bookchap"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ianzini|first1=Fiorenza|last2=Mackey|first2=Michael A | name-list-format = vanc |chapter=Mitotic Catastrophe|title=Apoptosis, Senescence, and Cancer|date=2007|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=978-1-58829-527-9|pages=73–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed following delayed DNA damage induced by [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ianzini F, Mackey MA | title = Delayed DNA damage associated with mitotic catastrophe following X-irradiation of HeLa S3 cells | journal = Mutagenesis | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 337–44 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9717169 | doi = 10.1093/mutage/13.4.337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be triggered by agents influencing the stability of microtubule spindles, various anticancer drugs and mitotic failure caused by defective cell cycle checkpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Castedo M, Perfettini JL, Roumier T, Andreau K, Medema R, Kroemer G | title = Cell death by mitotic catastrophe: a molecular definition | journal = Oncogene | volume = 23 | issue = 16 | pages = 2825–37 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15077146 | doi = 10.1038/sj.onc.1207528 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitotic catastrophe is the primary mechanism underlying reproductive cell death in cancer cells treated with [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref name="bookchap" /&gt;

Not all cells die immediately following abnormal mitosis caused by mitotic catastrophe, but many do. Cells that do not immediately die are likely to create [[aneuploidy|aneuploid cells]] following subsequent attempts at cell division posing a risk of [[oncogenesis]] (i.e. potentially leading to cancer). A very small fraction of these aneuploid cells produced by mitotic catastrophe might later reduce DNA ploidy by reductive division involving meiotic cell division pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prieur-Carrillo G, Chu K, Lindqvist J, Dewey WC | title = Computerized video time-lapse (CVTL) analysis of the fate of giant cells produced by X-irradiating EJ30 human bladder carcinoma cells | journal = Radiation Research | volume = 159 | issue = 6 | pages = 705–12 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12751952 | doi = 10.1667/rr3009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Erenpreisa J, Kalejs M, Ianzini F, Kosmacek EA, Mackey MA, Emzinsh D, Cragg MS, Ivanov A, Illidge TM | title = Segregation of genomes in polyploid tumour cells following mitotic catastrophe | journal = Cell Biology International | volume = 29 | issue = 12 | pages = 1005–11 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16314119 | doi = 10.1016/j.cellbi.2005.10.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ianzini F, Kosmacek EA, Nelson ES, Napoli E, Erenpreisa J, Kalejs M, Mackey MA | title = Activation of meiosis-specific genes is associated with depolyploidization of human tumor cells following radiation-induced mitotic catastrophe | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 2296–304 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19258501 | pmc = 2657811 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.can-08-3364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] created the [http://healthit.ahrq.gov AHRQ National Resource Center for Health Information Technology] (the National Resource Center or NRC) to support over 125 federal grants and contracts that are demonstrating the value and implementation of information technology in health care (health information technology).

With leadership from the [[National Opinion Research Center]] (NORC), the [http://www.regenstrief.org Regenstrief Institute], the [http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/vcbh/ Vanderbilt Center for Better Health], the [http://www.citl.org Center for IT Leadership (CITL)] and the [http://www.ehealthinitiative.org eHealth Initiative], the NRC monitors and provides technical assistance to federal grants that are implementing technologies such as [[Electronic health record]]s, [[Computerized_physician_order_entry | Computerized Physician Order Entry]], [[Health information exchange]] (HIE) and [[Telemedicine]]. The NRC directs almost half of its efforts and funding towards monitoring health IT development in rural communities.

In addition to its support of federal grants and agencies, the National Resource Center disseminates knowledge and best practices observed by the projects it supports. By way of the NRC's web site, health providers, administrators and researchers share lessons learned for how best to improve health care quality, safety, and efficiency in the United States through successful health IT adoption and usage.

The NRC does not provide grant money to individuals or organizations to do research in the fields of [[health care]] or [[health informatics]]. The NRC does provide, however, free educational resources and events where theory and case examples are presented by researchers active in these fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="788">A '''nicotine nasal spray''' is a [[nasal spray]] that contains a small dose of [[nicotine]], which enters the [[blood]] by being absorbed through the lining of the nose. This helps stop nicotine [[craving (withdrawal)|craving]]s and relieves symptoms that occur when a person is trying to [[quit smoking]]. A [[Medical prescription|prescription]] is needed for nicotine nasal spray in many countries. In the [[United Kingdom]], it can be purchased in a pharmacy as an [[Over-the-counter drug]].

The '''Parsemus Foundation''' is an [[United States|American]] [[non-governmental organization]] whose stated objective is to advance low cost [[evidence-based medicine]]s not pursued by the [[pharmaceutical industry]].&lt;ref name='ORiordanin 2011-07-15'&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Riordan |first=Michael |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/746456 |title=What Is the Parsemus Foundation? |work=Heartwire |publisher=[[Medscape]] |date=2011-07-15 |accessdate=2017-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation’s focus is on supporting small [[proof-of-concept]] studies and then pursuing press coverage of the results, so that the advances change treatment practice rather than disappearing into the scientific literature. Many of the studies supported involve low-cost approaches that are not under [[patent]]. 

==Background==
Founded in 2005, Parsemus is an advocate of research into the plausibility of [[Reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance|RISUG]], a reversible [[male contraceptive]].&lt;ref name='Haine 2010-07-05'&gt; {{cite news | first = Rosie | last = Haine | title = Men need more contraceptive choice | date = 2010-07-05 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10514490 | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sainani 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |title=This Time It's a Guy Thing |journal=Stanford Magazine |date= September–October 2012 |last=Sainani |first=Kristin |url=https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=55985 |accessdate=2017-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation began procuring RISUG's United States [[intellectual property]] rights in November 2010, completed the acquisition process in February 2012, and is now conducting [[toxicology testing|toxicology tests]] as an initial step towards [[Food and Drug Administration]] approval.&lt;ref name='Beck 2011-06-14'&gt; {{cite news | first = Melinda | last = Beck | title = 'Honey, It's Your Turn...' | date = 2011-06-14 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303848104576383730320049892 | work = The Wall Street Journal | accessdate = 2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url = http://parsemusfoundation.org/Parsemus/New_male_contraceptives.html | title = Parsemus Foundation | accessdate = 2012-10-13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121014135626/http://www.parsemusfoundation.org/Parsemus/New_male_contraceptives.html | archivedate = 2012-10-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Priceonomics"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://priceonomics.com/the-economics-of-male-birth-control/ |title=The Economics of Male Birth Control |work=Priceonomics |date=2015-10-19 |accessdate=2017-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal trials have thus far proved effective with no negative side effects; human trials are being planned for 2015-2016 with a possible market release by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parsemusfoundation.org/vasalgel-faqs/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plastiglomerate''' is a term that was proposed by Patricia Corcoran, [[Charles J.

==Origin==
Plastiglomerates form along [[shoreline]]s where natural sedimentary grains and organic debris are agglutinated by melted plastic created during [[campfire]] burning. They have been reported from Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii.&lt;ref name="The Geological Society of America" /&gt;

[[File:Medical sampling equipment.jpg|thumb]]
In [[medicine]], '''sampling''' is gathering of [[matter]] from the body to aid in the process of a [[medical diagnosis]] and/or evaluation of an [[indication (medicine)|indication]] for treatment, further [[medical test]]s or other procedures. In this sense, the '''sample''' is the gathered matter, and the '''sampling tool''' or '''sampler''' is the person or material to collect the sample.

Sampling is a prerequisite for many [[medical test]]s, but generally not for [[medical history]], [[physical examination]] and [[radiologic test]]s.

==By sampling technique==
*Obtaining excretions or materials that leave the body anyway, such as [[urine]], [[Feces|stool]], [[sputum]], or [[vomitus]], by direct collection as they exit.  A sample of [[saliva]] can also be collected from the mouth.  
*Excision (cutting out), a common method for the removal of solid or soft tissue samples. 
*{{anchor|aspiration}}Puncture (also called ''centesis'') followed by aspiration is the main method used for sampling of many types of tissues and body fluids. Examples are [[thoracocentesis]] to sample [[pleural fluid]], and [[amniocentesis]] to sample [[amniotic fluid]]. The main method of centesis, in turn, is [[fine needle aspiration]], but there are also somewhat differently designed needles, such as for [[bone marrow aspiration]]. Puncture ''without'' aspiration may suffice in, for example, [[capillary blood sampling]].
* Scraping or swiping. In a [[Pap test]], cells are scraped off a [[uterine cervix]] with a special [[spatula]] and brush or a special broom device that is inserted through a vagina without having to puncture any tissue. [[Epithelial cell]]s for [[DNA]] testing can be obtained by swiping the inside of a cheek in a mouth with a swab.

===Biopsy or cytopathology===
In terms of sampling technique, a [[biopsy]] generally refers to a preparation where the normal tissue structure is preserved, availing for examination of both individual cells and their organization for the study of [[histology]], while a sample for [[cytopathology]] is prepared primarily for the examination of individual cells, not necessarily preserving the tissue structure. Examples of biopsy procedures are [[bone marrow biopsy]], [[brain biopsy]], [[skin biopsy]] and [[liver biopsy]].

==By sampled matter==
Different types of matter that are sampled can be categorized by solidness versus fluidity, such as:
*Solid tissue, such as in [[bone marrow biopsy]]
*Soft tissue, such as in a [[muscle biopsy]]
*Body fluids

===Body fluid sampling===
''[[Body fluid]] sampling'' include:
*{{anchor|blood}}''Blood sampling'' for any [[blood test]], including:
**[[Artery|Arterial]] blood sampling, such as by [[radial artery puncture]].  This can be done for [[arterial blood gas]] analysis. 
**[[Capillary blood sampling]], generally by using a [[blood lancet]] for puncture, followed by sampling by [[capillary action]] with a test strip or small pipe.  This is common for routine [[diabetic]] monitoring for [[glucose]].
**[[Venous]] blood sampling, also called [[venipuncture]].  Other than routine diabetic monitoring for glucose, the majority of [[blood test]]s are done on samples of venous blood taken by a [[phlebotomist]] or similar worker.  Such samples are commonly collected in capped [[test tube]]s, often with a small amount of some sort of preservative.  
*[[Cerebrospinal fluid]] sampling, generally by [[lumbar puncture]]
*[[Pleural fluid]] sampling, generally by [[thoracocentesis]] 
*[[Amniotic fluid]] sampling, generally by [[amniocentesis]]
*[[Peritoneal fluid]] sampling, generally by [[peritoneocentesis]] (also called ''laparocentesis''). It can be used for [[Cytopathology|cytology]] to detect spread of [[gynecologic cancer]]s.

==By component of interest==
The sampled matter can be analyzed for various components, for example:
*[[Electrolytes]]
*[[Protein]]s
*[[Cell (biology)|cells]], such as [[white blood cell]]s in blood sampling
*Microbiological agents, such as bacteria or fungi

===Microbiological sampling===
''[[Medical microbiology|Microbiological]] sampling'' include:
*''Blood sampling'' for [[blood culture]]s, performed similarly as that for tests on the fluid itself above
*{{anchor|swab}}''Throat swab'' for [[throat culture]]. It is performed by applying a [[cotton swab]] to the surface of the [[throat]].
*{{anchor|brush}}Sampling of [[sputum]] from the [[lungs]] for [[sputum culture]]. It can be performed by special techniques of coughing, or by a ''protected specimen brush'' (PSB),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

A '''scar''' is an area of [[fibrosis|fibrous tissue]] that replaces normal [[skin]] after an injury. Scars result from the biological process of [[wound]] repair in the skin, as well as in other [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the body. Thus, scarring is a natural part of the [[healing]] process. With the exception of very minor [[lesion]]s, every wound (e.g., after [[accident]], [[disease]], or [[surgery]]) results in some degree of scarring. An exception to this are animals with complete [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], which regrow tissue without scar formation.

Scar tissue is composed of the same protein ([[collagen]]) as the tissue that it replaces, but the fiber composition of the protein is different; instead of a random basketweave formation of the collagen fibers found in normal tissue, in fibrosis the collagen cross-links and forms a pronounced alignment in a single direction.&lt;ref name="collagenskinscar2010-08-20"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Sherratt  | first = Jonathan A.  | title = Mathematical Modelling of Scar Tissue Formation  | quote = This is composed of the same main protein (collagen) as normal skin, but with differences in details of composition. Most crucially, the protein fibres in normal tissue have a random (basketweave) appearance, while those in scar tissue have pronounced alignment in a single direction.  | publisher = Department of Mathematics, Heriot-Watt University  | year = 2010  | url = http://www.ma.hw.ac.uk/~jas/researchinterests/scartissueformation.html  | accessdate = 20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collagen scar tissue alignment is usually of inferior functional quality to the normal collagen randomised alignment. For example, scars in the skin are less resistant to [[ultraviolet radiation]], and [[sweat gland]]s and [[hair follicle]]s do not grow back within scar tissues.&lt;ref name=Kraftlynde/&gt; A [[myocardial infarction]], commonly known as a heart attack,  causes [[Myocardial scarring|scar formation]] in the [[heart]] muscle, which leads to loss of muscular power and possibly [[heart failure]]. However, there are some tissues (e.g. [[bone]]) that can heal without any structural or functional deterioration.

All scarring is composed of the same collagen as the tissue it has replaced, but the composition of the scar tissue, compared to the normal tissue, is different.&lt;ref name=collagenskinscar2010-08-20/&gt; Scar tissue also lacks elasticity&lt;ref name=elasticFibersScars&gt;{{cite book | last = A.

Scars differ in the amounts of collagen overexpressed. Labels have been applied to the differences in overexpression. Two of the most common types are hypertrophic and [[keloid]] scarring,&lt;ref name=Roseborough2004/&gt; both of which experience excessive stiff collagen bundled growth overextending the tissue, blocking off regeneration of tissues. Another form is atrophic scarring (sunken scarring), which also has an overexpression of collagen blocking regeneration. This scar type is sunken, because the collagen bundles do not overextend the tissue. Stretch marks (striae) are regarded as scars by some.

High melanin levels and either African or Asian ancestry may make adverse scarring more noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kelly AP | title = Update on the Management of Keloids | journal = Seminars in Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 71–76 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19608056 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.sder.2009.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hypertrophic ===
{{main|Hypertrophic scars}}
[[Hypertrophic scars]] occur when the body overproduces collagen, which causes the scar to be raised above the surrounding skin. [[Organ hypertrophy|Hypertrophic]] scars take the form of a red raised lump on the skin. They usually occur within 4 to 8 weeks following wound infection or wound closure with excess tension and/or other traumatic skin injuries.&lt;ref name=Roseborough2004&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gauglitz GG, Korting HC, Pavicic T, Ruzicka T, Jeschke MG | title = Hypertrophic Scarring and Keloids: Pathomechanisms and Current and Emerging Treatment Strategies | journal = Mol Med | volume = 17 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 113–125 | date = January–February 2011 | pmid = 20927486 | pmc = 3022978 | doi = 10.2119/molmed.2009.00153 | url = http://www.molmed.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keloid===
{{Main|Keloid}}
[[File:Cicatrices de flagellation sur un esclave.jpg|thumb|Keloid scarring following persistent whipping. People with darker skin pigmentation are more prone to the development of keloid scarring.]]
Keloid scars are a more serious form of excessive scarring, because they can grow indefinitely into large, tumorous (although benign) [[neoplasm]]s.&lt;ref name=Roseborough2004/&gt;

Hypertrophic scars are often distinguished from keloid scars by their lack of growth outside the original wound area, but this commonly taught distinction can lead to confusion.&lt;ref name="Roseborough2004a"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roseborough IE, Grevious MA, Lee RC | title = Prevention and treatment of excessive dermal scarring | journal = J Natl Med Assoc | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 108–16 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14746360 | pmc = 2594768 | doi =  | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keloid scars can occur on anyone, but they are most common in dark-skinned people.&lt;ref&gt;Martini, Frederic H. (2006). ''Fundamentals of Anatomy &amp; Physiology,'' Seventh Edition, p. 171. Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; They can be caused by surgery, accident, [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] or, sometimes, [[body piercings]]. In some people, keloid scars form spontaneously. Although they can be a cosmetic problem, keloid scars are only inert masses of collagen and therefore completely harmless and not cancerous. However, they can be itchy or painful in some individuals. They tend to be most common on the [[shoulder]]s and [[chest]]. Hypertrophic scars and keloids tend to be more common in wounds closed by secondary intention.&lt;ref name=secinten201104/&gt; Surgical removal of keloid is risky and may excerbate the condition and worsening of the keloid.

=== Atrophic ===
An atrophic scar takes the form of a sunken recess in the skin, which has a pitted appearance. These are caused when underlying structures supporting the skin, such as [[fat]] or [[muscle]], are lost. This type of scarring is often associated with acne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goodman GJ | title = Postacne scarring: A review of its pathophysiology and treatment | journal = Dermatologic Surgery | volume = 26 | issue = 9 | pages = 857–871 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10971560 | doi=10.1046/j.1524-4725.2000.99232.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fabbrocini G, Annunziata MC, D'Arco V, De Vita V, Lodi G, Mauriello MC, Pastore F, Monfrecola G | title = Acne Scars: Pathogenesis, Classification and Treatment | journal = Dermatology Research and Practice | volume = 2010 | pages = 1–13 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20981308 | pmc = 2958495 | doi = 10.1155/2010/893080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[chickenpox]], other diseases (especially ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' infection), surgery, certain insect and spider bites, or accidents. It can also be caused by a genetic [[connective tissue]] disorder, such as [[Ehlers–Danlos syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes#H35121407|title=Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes|website=www.uptodate.com|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stretch marks ===
{{Main|Stretch marks}}
Stretch marks (technically called ''striae'') are also a form of scarring. These are caused when the skin is stretched rapidly (for instance during [[pregnancy]],&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/14651858.CD000066"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Young | first1 = G. | last2 = Jewell | first2 = D. | title = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD000066 | year = 1996 | pmid =  10796111| pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000066 | chapter = Creams for preventing stretch marks in pregnancy | editor1-first = Gavin | editor1-last = Young }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23152199|date = October 2018}} significant weight gain, or adolescent [[growth spurt]]s),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elsaie ML, Baumann LS, Elsaaiee LT | title = Striae Distensae (Stretch Marks) and Different Modalities of Therapy: An Update | journal = Dermatologic Surgery | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 563–573 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19400881 | doi = 10.1111/j.1524-4725.2009.01094.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; or when skin is put under tension during the healing process, (usually near [[joints]]). This type of scar usually improves in appearance after a few years.&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/14651858.CD000066"/&gt;

=== Umbilical ===
Humans and other [[List of placental mammals|placental mammals]] have an umbilical scar (commonly referred to as to a [[navel]]) which starts to heal when the [[umbilical cord]] is cut after birth. Egg-laying animals have an umbilical scar which, depending on the species, may remain visible for life or disappear within a few days after birth.&lt;ref&gt;"What Types of Animals Have Been to Space and More Questions From our Readers", Smithsonian Magazine May 2012, https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/what-types-of-animals-have-been-to-space-and-more-questions-from-our-readers-63029589/ Retrieved 25 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flat-tailed horned lizard (Phrynosoma mcallii), US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service https://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/arizona/Documents/Redbook/Flat-Tailed%20Horned%20Lizard%20RB.pdf Retrieved 25 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==

A scar is the product of the body's repair mechanism after tissue injury. If a wound heals quickly within two weeks with new formation of skin, minimal collagen will be deposited and no scar will form.&lt;ref name=bursurg&gt;{{Cite web| title = POST BURN SCAR RELATIVE TO RE-EPITHELIALIZATION| publisher = eplasty.com| year = 2011| url = http://eplasty.com/images/PDF/ManageBurnWound-part4.pdf| quote = Healing in 2 weeks – minimal to no scar; Healing in 3 weeks – minimal to no scar except in high risk scar formers;Healing in 4 weeks or more – hypertrophic in more than 50% of patients| accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the extracellular matrix senses elevated mechanical stress loading, tissue will scar,&lt;ref name=scarStress2011/&gt; and scars can be limited by stress shielding wounds.&lt;ref name=scarStress2011&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15350879| title = Pushing Back: Wound Mechanotransduction in Repair and Regeneration| last = Victor W.Wong, SatoshiAkaishi, Michael T.Longaker, Geoffrey C.Gurtner | date = | year = 2011| website = sciencedirect.com| publisher = Journal of Investigative Dermatology| access-date = 17 October 2018| quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small full thickness wounds under 2mm reepithilize fast and heal scar free.&lt;ref name=myoscar201103/&gt;&lt;ref name=smallWound&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tam |first1=Joshua |last2=Wang |first2=Ying |last3=Vuong |first3=Linh N. |last4=Fisher |first4=Jeremy M. |last5=Farinelli |first5=William A. |last6=Anderson |first6=R.

The [[endometrium]], the inner lining of the uterus, is the only adult tissue to undergo rapid cyclic shedding and regeneration without scarring; shedding and restoring roughly inside a 7-day window on a monthly basis.&lt;ref name=Scrrpr2012918&gt;{{cite web| title = Endometrial repair| quote = Importantly, the endometrium is the only adult tissue to undergo rapid cyclic repair without scarring.| publisher = princehenrys.org| date = 18 September 2012 | url = http://www.princehenrys.org/endometrial-repair-menstruation| accessdate = 30 June 2013| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090914010721/http://www.princehenrys.org/endometrial-repair-menstruation| dead-url = yes| archivedate =2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other adult tissues, upon rapid shedding or injury, can scar.

Prolonged [[inflammation]], as well as the [[fibroblast]] proliferation&lt;ref name="Fibroblast"/&gt; can occur. Redness that often follows an injury to the skin is not a scar, and is generally not permanent (see [[wound healing]]). The time it takes for this redness to dissipate may, however, range from a few days to, in some serious and rare cases, a few years. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Scars form differently based on the location of the injury on the body and the age of the person who was injured. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The worse the initial damage is, the worse the scar will generally be. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Skin scars occur when the [[dermis]] (the deep, thick layer of skin) is damaged. Most skin scars are flat and leave a trace of the original [[injury]] that caused them. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Collagen synthesis===
Any injury does not become a scar until the wound has completely healed; this can take many months, or years in the worst pathological cases, such as keloids. To begin to patch the damage, a clot is created; the clot is the beginning process that results in a provisional matrix. In the process, the first layer is a provisional matrix and is not scar. Over time, the wounded body tissue then overexpresses collagen inside the provisional matrix to create a collagen matrix. This collagen overexpression continues and crosslinks the fiber arrangement inside the collagen matrix, making the collagen dense. This densely packed collagen, morphing into an inelastic whitish collagen&lt;ref name="Fibroblast"/&gt; scar wall, blocks off cell communication and regeneration; as a result, the new tissue generated will have a different texture and quality than the surrounding unwounded tissue. This prolonged collagen-producing process results in a fortuna scar.

====Fibroblasts====
The scarring is created by fibroblast proliferation,&lt;ref name="Fibroblast"/&gt; a process that begins with a reaction to the clot.&lt;ref name =Fibroblasts2007-12-17&gt;{{Cite web| last = Parlange| first = Mary | title = New mechanical insights into wound healing and scar tissue formation| quote = The body launches a complex rescue operation.

=====Myofibroblast=====
The fibroblast involved in scarring and contraction is the [[myofibroblast]],&lt;ref name=myo201103/&gt; which is a specialized contractile fibroblast.&lt;ref name=myo2011033/&gt; These cells express α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA).&lt;ref name=myosm201103&gt;{{Cite web|author=Traci A.

The myofibroblasts make up a high proportion of the fibroblasts proliferating in the postembryonic wound at the onset of healing.

Filler injections of [[collagen]] can be used to raise atrophic scars to the level of surrounding skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper JS, Lee BT | title = Treatment of facial scarring: lasers, filler, and nonoperative techniques | journal = Facial Plastic Surgery | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 311–5 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20024872 | doi = 10.1055/s-0029-1243079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Risks vary based upon the filler used, and can include further disfigurement and [[allergic reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lemperle G, Rullan PP, Gauthier-Hazan N | title = Avoiding and treating dermal filler complications | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 118 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 92S–107S | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16936549 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000234672.69287.77 | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/4t0019d6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laser treatment ===
Nonablative lasers, such as the 585&amp;nbsp;nm [[pulsed dye laser]], 1064&amp;nbsp;nm and 1320&amp;nbsp;nm [[Nd:YAG]], or the 1540&amp;nbsp;nm [[Er:Glass]] are used as laser therapy for hypertrophic scars and keloids.&lt;ref name="pmid21061757"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elsaie ML, Choudhary S | title = Lasers for scars: a review and evidence-based appraisal | journal = Journal of Drugs in Dermatology | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = 1355–62 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21061757 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For burn scars they improve the appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Willows|first1=BM|last2=Ilyas|first2=M|last3=Sharma|first3=A|title=Laser in the management of burn scars.|journal=Burns |date=4 August 2017|doi=10.1016/j.burns.2017.07.001|pmid=28784339|volume=43|issue=7|pages=1379–1389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radiotherapy ===
Low-dose, superficial [[radiotherapy]] is sometimes used to prevent recurrence of severe keloid and hypertrophic scarring.

Silicone scar treatments are commonly used in preventing scar formation and improving existing scar appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stavrou D, Weissman O, Winkler E, Yankelson L, Millet E, Mushin OP, Liran A, Haik J | title = Silicone-based scar therapy: a review of the literature | journal = Aesthetic Plastic Surgery | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 646–51 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20354695 | doi = 10.1007/s00266-010-9496-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-study by the Cochrane collaboration found weak evidence that silicone gel sheeting helps prevent scarring.&lt;ref name=Ob2013/&gt; However, the studies examining it were of poor quality and susceptible to bias.&lt;ref name=Ob2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Brien|first1=L|last2=Jones|first2=DJ|title=Silicone gel sheeting for preventing and treating hypertrophic and keloid scars.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=12 September 2013|volume=9|issue=9|pages=CD003826|pmid=24030657|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003826.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pressure dressing]]s are commonly used in managing burn and hypertrophic scars, although supporting evidence is lacking.&lt;ref name=Shih2007&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shih R, Waltzman J, Evans GR | title = Review of over-the-counter topical scar treatment products | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 119 | issue = 3 | pages = 1091–5 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17312518 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000255814.75012.35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Care providers commonly report improvements, however, and pressure therapy has been effective in treating ear keloids.&lt;ref name=Shih2007/&gt; The general acceptance of the treatment as effective may prevent it from being further studied in clinical trials.&lt;ref name=Shih2007/&gt;

=== Steroids ===
A long-term course of [[corticosteroid]] injections into the scar may help flatten and soften the appearance of keloid or hypertrophic scars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roques C, Téot L | title = The Use of Corticosteroids to Treat Keloids: A Review | journal = The International Journal of Lower Extremity Wounds | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 137–145 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18611924 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1177/1534734608320786 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topical steroids are ineffective.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Jenkins M, Alexander JW, MacMillan BG, Waymack JP, Kopcha R. Failure of topical steroids and vitamin E to reduce postoperative scar formation following reconstructive surgery. J Burn Care Rehabil. 1986 Jul–Aug;7(4):309–312.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[clobetasol propionate]] can be used as an alternative treatment for keloid scars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=A Randomized, Single-Blind Trial of Clobetasol Propionate 0.05% Cream Under Silicone Dressing Occlusion Versus Intra-Lesional Triamcinolone for Treatment of Keloid | journal=Clinical Drug Investigation | volume=37 | issue=3 | pages=295–301 | date=2016-11-25 | pmid=27888448 | last1=Nor | first1=N.

=== Surgery ===
[[File:scar revision.jpg|right|thumb|Scarring caused by [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] (left), and photo one day after scar revision surgery: The area around sutures is still swollen from surgery.]]

Scar revision is a process of cutting the scar tissue out. After the excision, the new wound is usually closed up to heal by [[primary intention]], instead of [[secondary intention]]. Deeper cuts need a multilayered closure to heal optimally, otherwise depressed or dented scars can result.&lt;ref name=scarrevision2010&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Scar revisions  | quote = Deep cuts need multi-layered closure to heal optimally; otherwise, depressed or dented scars can result  | url = http://www.haplasticsurgery.com/scar-revision-surgery-dallas-texas.html  | accessdate = 16 October 2010  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120119050557/http://www.haplasticsurgery.com/scar-revision-surgery-dallas-texas.html  | archive-date = 19 January 2012  | dead-url = yes  | df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surgical excision of hypertrophic or keloid scars is often associated to other methods, such as pressotherapy or silicone gel sheeting. Lone excision of keloid scars, however, shows a recurrence rate close to 45%. A clinical study is currently ongoing to assess the benefits of a treatment combining surgery and laser-assisted healing in hypertrophic or keloid scars.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

''Subcision'' is a process used to treat deep rolling scars left behind by [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] or other skin diseases. It is also used to lessen the appearance of severe [[glabella]] lines, though its effectiveness in this application is debatable. Essentially the process involves separating the skin tissue in the affected area from the deeper scar tissue. This allows the blood to pool under the affected area, eventually causing the deep rolling scar to level off with the rest of the skin area. Once the skin has leveled, treatments such as [[laser resurfacing]], [[microdermabrasion]] or [[chemical peel]]s can be used to smooth out the scarred tissue. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Vitamins===
Research shows the use of [[vitamin E]] and onion extract (sold as [[Mederma]]) as treatments for scars is ineffective.&lt;ref name=Shih2007/&gt; Vitamin E causes contact [[dermatitis]] in up to 33% of users and in some cases it may worsen scar appearance and could cause minor skin irritations,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; but Vitamin C and some of its esters fade the dark pigment associated with some scars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Farris PK. Topical vitamin C: a useful agent for treating photoaging and other dermatologic conditions. Although many people claim that vitamin therapy does in fact help. Dermatol Surg 2005;31:814-818.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
*Cosmetics; Medical makeup can temporarily conceal scars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Medical Makeup for Concealing Facial Scars|url = http://pubs.bli.uci.edu/sites/default/files/publications/s-0032-1325647.pdf|journal = Facial Plastic Surgery|date = 2012-10-01|pages = 536–540|volume = 28|issue = 5|doi = 10.1055/s-0032-1325647|language = en|first = Donna|last = Mee|first2 = Brian|last2 = Wong|pmid=23027221}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is most commonly used for [[Face|facial]] scars.
*[[Dermabrasion]] involves the removal of the surface of the skin with special equipment, and usually involves a [[local anaesthetic]].
*[[Massage]] has weak evidence of efficacy in scar management. Any beneficial effect appears to be greater in wounds created by [[surgical incision]] than traumatic wounds or [[burn]] wounds.&lt;ref name="ShinBordeaux2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shin|first1=Thuzar M.|last2=Bordeaux|first2=Jeremy S.|title=The Role of Massage in Scar Management: A Literature Review|journal=Dermatologic Surgery|volume=38|issue=3|year=2012|pages=414–423|issn=1076-0512|doi=10.1111/j.1524-4725.2011.02201.x|pmid=22093081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

=== Intentional scarring ===
{{main|Scarification}}
The permanence of scarring has led to its intentional use as a form of [[body art]] within some cultures and subcultures. These forms of  ritual and non-ritual scarring practices can be found in many groups and cultures around the world.

===Etymology===
First attested in English in the late 14th century, the word ''scar'' derives from a conflation of [[Old French]] ''escharre'', from [[Late Latin]] ''eschara'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Deschara eschara], 
Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἐσχάρα (''eskhara''), meaning "hearth, fireplace", but in medicine "scab, eschar on a wound caused by burning or otherwise,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29sxa%2Fra ἐσχάρα], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=scar Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Middle English]] ''skar'' ("cut, crack, incision"), which is from [[Old Norse]] ''skarð'' ("notch, gap"). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=scar Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;. The conflation helped to form the English meaning. Compare [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] for evolution of ''skarð'' to ''scar''.

==Research==
An intradermal injection of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFβ3) is being tested. The results of three trials already completed were published in the ''Lancet'' along with an editorial commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Renovo. [http://www.renovo.com/en/news/lancet-publication]. Lancet trials in: 11 April 2009 (vol. 373, pages 1264-1274). Lancet commentary by Edward Tredget in: vol 373, pages 1226-1228&lt;/ref&gt;

A study implicated the protein [[ribosomal s6 kinase]] (RSK) in the formation of scar tissue and found the introduction of a chemical to counteract RSK could halt the formation of [[cirrhosis]].  This treatment also has the potential to reduce or even prevent altogether other types of scarring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liver damage 'could be reversed' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7152415.stm |date=27 December 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also implicated [[osteopontin]] in scarring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jem.rupress.org/cgi/content/abstract/205/1/43 'Molecular mechanisms linking wound inflammation and fibrosis: knockdown of osteopontin leads to rapid repair and reduced scarring']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7199897.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gel 'to speed up wound healing' | date=22 January 2008 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==
On April 12, 2012, [[Dmitry Medvedev]] (who was the President of Russia from May 7, 2008 through May 7, 2012) ordered that the Government of Moscow,  the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation and Sberbank should submit proposals for creating an international medical cluster in the new areas of Moscow (New Moscow) which was to include treatment, education and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ria.ru/infografika/20120412/624438601.html|title=Five orders from the President for developing "New Moscow"|author=|first=|date=|work=RIA Novosti|accessdate=2017-10-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was planned to build the cluster in [[Communarka shooting ground|Kommunarka]] in [[Novomoskovsky Administrative Okrug|New Moscow]].
 
On June 11, 2015, the State Duma adopted the Federal Law No. 160-2015 On the International Medical Cluster stipulating the final location of the project. It was decided that the cluster would be built in Skolkovo rather than in New Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=New Moscow loses a megaproject: the medical cluster  is taken to Skolkovo|author=|url=https://realty.rbc.ru/news/577d21509a7947a78ce91370|work=RBC|date=|accessdate=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:valleyofdrums.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Valley of the Drums]], a toxic waste site in Kentucky, United States, 1980.]]
'''Toxic waste''' is any unwanted material in all forms that can cause harm (e.g. by being inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through the skin). Many of today's household products such as televisions, computers and phones contain toxic chemicals that can pollute the air and contaminate soil and water. Disposing of such waste is a major public health issue.

==Classifying toxic materials==
Toxic materials are poisonous byproducts as a result of industries such as manufacturing, farming, construction, automotive, laboratories, and hospitals which may contain [[heavy metals]], [[radiation]], dangerous [[pathogen]]s, or other [[toxin]]s. [[Toxicity|Toxic]] waste has become more abundant since the [[industrial revolution]], causing serious global health issues. Disposing of such waste has become even more critical with the addition of numerous technological advances containing [[toxic compound|toxic chemical components]]. Products such as [[cellular telephone]]s, computers, [[TV set|televisions]], and [[solar panel]]s contain toxic chemicals that can harm the environment if not disposed of properly to prevent the pollution of the air and contamination of soils and water. A material is considered toxic when it causes death or harm by being inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through the skin.

The waste can [[chemical waste|contain chemicals]], [[Toxic heavy metal|heavy metals]], radiation, dangerous pathogens, or other toxins. Even households generate [[hazardous waste]] from items such as batteries, [[e-waste|used computer equipment]], and leftover paints or pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/toxic-waste-overview/|title=Toxic Waste|date=2016-05-03|work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic material can be either human-made and others are naturally occurring in the environment. Not all hazardous substances are considered toxic.

The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) has identified 11 key substances that pose a risk to human health:
* '''[[Arsenic]]:''' used in making electrical circuits, as an ingredient in [[pesticides]], and as a [[wood preservative]]. It is classified as a [[carcinogen]].
* '''[[Asbestos]]:''' is a material that was once used for the insulation of buildings, and some businesses are still using this material to manufacture [[roofing material]]s and [[brake]]s. Inhalation of asbestos fibers can lead to lung cancer and [[asbestosis]].
* '''[[Cadmium]]:''' is found in [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] and [[plastics]]. It can be inhaled through [[cigarette smoke]], or digested when included as a [[food coloring|pigment in food]]. Exposure leads to lung damage, irritation of the digestive track, and [[kidney disease]].
* '''[[Chromium]]:''' is used as brick lining for high-temperature industrial furnaces, as a solid metal used for making steel, and in [[chrome plating]], manufacturing [[dye]]s and pigments, wood preserving, and [[leather tanning]]. It is known to cause cancer, and prolonged exposure can cause chronic [[bronchitis]] and damage lung tissue.
* '''[[Clinical waste]]s:''' such as syringes and medication bottles can spread pathogens and harmful microorganisms, leading to a variety of illnesses.
* '''[[Cyanide]]:''' a poison found in some pesticides and [[rodenticide]]s. In large doses it can lead to [[paralysis]], [[convulsions]], and respiratory distress.
* '''[[Lead]]:''' is found in batteries, paints, and [[ammunition]]. When ingested or inhaled can cause harm to the nervous and reproductive systems, and kidneys.
* '''[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]:''' used for [[dental filling]]s and batteries. It is also used in the production of [[chlorine gas]]. Exposure can lead to [[birth defects]] and kidney and brain damage
* '''PCBs''', or [[polychlorinated biphenyls]], are used in many manufacturing processes, by the utility industry, and in paints and [[sealant]]s. Damage can occur through exposure, affecting the nervous, reproductive, and immune systems, as well as the liver.
* '''POPs''', [[persistent organic pollutant]]s. They are found in chemicals and pesticides, and may lead to nervous and reproductive system defects. They can [[bio-accumulate]] in the food chain or persist in the environment and be moved great distances through the atmosphere.
* '''Strong acids and alkalis''' used in manufacturing and industrial production. They can destroy tissue and cause internal damage to the body.

The most overlooked toxic and hazardous wastes are the [[household waste|household]] products in everyday homes that are improperly disposed of such as old batteries, pesticides, paint, and car oil. Toxic waste can be reactive, ignitable, and corrosive. In the United States, these wastes are regulated under the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA).&lt;ref name="RCRA statute"&gt;United States. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, {{uspl|94|580}}, {{USStat|90|2795}}, {{USC|42|6901}}. Approved 1976-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Reactivity (chemistry)|Reactive]] wastes are those that can cause explosions when heated, mixed with water or compressed. They can release toxic gases into the air. They are unstable even in normal conditions. An example is [[lithium–sulfur battery|lithium–sulfur batteries]].
* [[Ignitibility|Ignitable]] wastes have flash points of less than 60 degrees Celsius. They are very combustible and can cause fires. Examples are solvents and waste oils.
* [[Corrosive]] wastes are liquids capable of corroding metal containers. These are acids or bases that have pH levels of less than or equal to 2, or greater than or equal to 12.5. An example is [[battery acid]].

With the increase of worldwide technology, there are more substances that are being considered toxic and harmful to human health. Some of this technology includes cell phones and computers. Such items have been given the name [[e-waste]] or EEE, which stands for Electrical and Electronic Equipment. This term is also used for goods such as refrigerators, toys, and washing machines. These items can contain toxic components that can break down into water systems when discarded. The reduction in the cost of these goods has allowed for these items to be distributed globally without thought or consideration to managing the goods once they become ineffective or broken.

In the US, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and state environmental agencies develop and enforce regulations on the storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste. The EPA requires that toxic waste be handled with special precautions and be disposed of in designated facilities around the country. Also, many US cities have collection days where household toxic waste is gathered. Some materials that may not be accepted at regular landfills are ammunition, commercially generated waste, explosives/shock sensitive items, hypodermic needles/syringes, [[medical waste]], radioactive materials, and smoke detectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Toxic Waste |last=Vaughn |first=J |year=2013 |isbn=9780765682932 |location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health defects==

Toxic wastes often contain [[carcinogen]]s, and exposure to these by some route, such as leakage or evaporation from the storage, causes cancer to appear at increased frequency in exposed individuals. For example, a [[cancer cluster|cluster]] of the rare blood cancer [[polycythemia vera]] was found around a toxic waste dump site in northeast Pennsylvania in 2008.&lt;ref name="NEPennsylvania"&gt;{{cite journal | author = MICHAEL RUBINKAM | title = Cancer cluster confirmed in northeast Pennsylvania | journal = Associated Press | url = https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080826/ap_on_sc/toxic_dump_fears | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human &amp; Ecological Risk Assessment Journal conducted a study which focused on the health of individuals living near municipal landfills to see if it would be as harmful as living near hazardous landfills. They conducted a 7-year study that specifically tested for 18 types of cancers to see if the participants had higher rates than those that don’t live around landfills. They conducted this study in western Massachusetts within a 1-mile radius of the North Hampton Regional Landfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goodman Julie E., Hudson Todd C., Monteiro Richard J. | year = 2010 | title = Cancer Cluster Investigation In Residents Near A Municipal Landfill | url = | journal = Human &amp; Ecological Risk Assessment | volume = 16 | issue = 6| pages = 1339–59 | doi=10.1080/10807039.2010.526504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People encounter these toxins buried in the [[soil contamination|ground]], in stream runoff, in [[groundwater contamination|groundwater]] that supplies drinking water, or in floodwaters, as happened after Hurricane Katrina. Some toxins, such as mercury, persist in the environment and accumulate. As a result of the [[bioaccumulation]] of mercury in both [[freshwater ecosystem|freshwater]] and [[marine ecosystem]]s, [[predatory fish]] are a significant source of mercury in human and animal diets.&lt;ref name="environment.nationalgeographic.com"&gt;"Toxic Waste."

==Handling and disposal==
{{main|Hazardous Waste Disposal}}
{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
One of the biggest problems with today's toxic material is how to dispose of it properly. Before the passage of modern environmental laws (in the US, this was in the 1970s), it was legal to dump such wastes into streams, rivers and oceans, or bury it underground in [[landfill]]s. The US [[Clean Water Act]], enacted in 1972, and RCRA, enacted in 1976, created nationwide programs to regulate the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 ("Clean Water Act"). {{uspl|92|500}}, October 18, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author-last=Copeland |author-first=Claudia |date=2016-10-18 |title=Clean Water Act: A Summary of the Law |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30030.pdf |publisher=U.S. Congressional Research Service |location=Washington, D.C. |id=RL30030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agriculture industry uses over 800,000 tons of pesticides worldwide annually that contaminates soils, and eventually infiltrates into groundwater, which can contaminate drinking water supplies. The oceans can be polluted from the [[surface runoff|stormwater runoff]] of these chemicals as well. Toxic waste in the form of petroleum oil can either spill into the oceans from pipe leaks or large ships, but it can also enter the oceans from everyday citizens dumping car oil into the rainstorm sewer systems. Disposal is the placement of waste into or on the land. Disposal facilities are usually designed to permanently contain the waste and prevent the release of harmful pollutants to the environment.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The most common hazardous waste disposal practice is placement in a land disposal unit such as a landfill, surface impoundment, waste pile, land treatment unit, or injection well. Land disposal is subject to requirements under EPA's Land Disposal Restrictions Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/hw/land-disposal-restrictions-hazardous-waste |title=Land Disposal Restrictions for Hazardous Waste |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-08-16 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Injection wells are regulated under the federal [[Safe Drinking Water Act#Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program|Underground Injection Control]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/uic |title=Protecting Underground Sources of Drinking Water from Underground Injection |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-05-09 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic wastes can be destroyed by [[incineration]] at high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etc.org/advanced-technologies/high-temperature-incineration.aspx|title=High Temperature Incineration|publisher=''Environmental Technology Council''|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the waste contains [[heavy metals]] or [[radioactive isotopes]], these must be separated and stored, as they cannot be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/hw/regulatory-exclusions-and-alternative-standards-recycling-materials-solid-wastes-and-hazardous |title=Regulatory Exclusions and Alternative Standards for the Recycling of Materials, Solid Wastes and Hazardous Wastes |date=2017-08-10 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method of storage will seek to immobilize the toxic components of the waste, possibly through storage in sealed containers, inclusion in a stable medium such as glass or a cement mixture, or burial under an impermeable clay cap. Waste transporters and waste facilities may charge fees; consequently, improper methods of disposal may be used to avoid paying these fees. Where the handling of toxic waste is regulated, the improper disposal of toxic waste may be punishable by fines&lt;ref name="environment.nationalgeographic.com"/&gt; or prison terms. Burial sites for toxic waste and other contaminated [[brownfield land]] may eventually be used as [[Urban open space|greenspace]] or redeveloped for commercial or industrial use.

===History of US toxic waste regulation===
{{Overly detailed|section|date=August 2017}}
RCRA governs the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste.&lt;ref name="RCRA basics"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/hw/learn-basics-hazardous-waste |title=Learn the Basics of Hazardous Waste |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-08-16 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Toxic Substances Control Act]], also enacted in 1976, authorizes EPA to collect information on all new and existing chemical substances, as well as to control any substances that were determined to cause unreasonable risk to public health or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Toxic Substances Control Act. {{uspl|94|469}}, approved 1976-10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPA TSCA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/chemicals-under-tsca |title=Chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-06-28 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Superfund]] law, passed in 1980, created a cleanup program for abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste sites.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (commonly known as "Superfund"). {{uspl|96|510}}, approved 1980-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a long ongoing battle between communities and environmentalists versus governments and corporations about how strictly and how fairly the regulations and laws are written and enforced. That battle began in North Carolina in the late summer of 1979, as EPA's TSCA regulations were being implemented. In North Carolina, PCB-contaminated oil was deliberately dripped along rural Piedmont highways, creating the largest PCB spills in American history and a public health crisis that would have repercussions for generations to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncpcbarchives.com/?page_id=144 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812171731/http://www.ncpcbarchives.com/?page_id=144 |archivedate=2016-08-12 |df= }}{{self-published source|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCB-contaminated material was eventually collected and buried in a [[Warren County PCB Landfill|landfill in Warren County]], but citizens' opposition, including large public demonstrations, exposed the dangers of toxic waste, the fallibility of landfills then in use, and EPA regulations allowing landfills to be built on marginal, but politically acceptable sites.

Warren County citizens argued that the toxic waste landfill regulations were based on the fundamental assumption that the  EPA's conceptual dry-tomb landfill would contain the toxic waste. This assumption informed the siting of toxic waste landfills and waivers to regulations that were included in EPA's ''Federal Register.'' For example, in 1978, the base of a major toxic waste landfill could be no closer than  five feet from ground water, but this regulation and others could be waived. The waiver to the regulation concerning the distance between the base of a toxic waste landfill and groundwater allowed the base to be only a foot above ground water if the owner/operator of the facility could demonstrate to the EPA regional administrator that a [[leachate]] collection system could be installed and that there would be no hydraulic connection between the base of the landfill and groundwater. Citizens argued that the waivers to the siting regulations were discriminatory mechanisms facilitating the shift from scientific to political considerations concerning the siting decision and that in the South this would mean a discriminatory proliferation of dangerous waste management facilities in poor black and other minority communities. They also argued that the scientific consensus was that permanent containment could not be assured. As resistance to the siting of the PCB landfill in Warren County continued and studies revealed that EPA dry-tomb landfills were failing, EPA stated in its ''Federal Register'' that all landfills would eventually leak and should only be used as a stopgap measure.

Years of research and empirical knowledge of the failures of the  Warren County PCB landfill led citizens of Warren County to  conclude  that the EPA's dry-tomb landfill design and regulations governing the disposal of toxic and hazardous waste were not based on sound science and adequate technology. Warren County's citizens concluded also that North Carolina's ''1981 Waste Management Act'' was scientifically and constitutionally unacceptable because it authorized the siting of toxic, hazardous and nuclear waste facilities prior to public hearings, preempted local authority over the siting of the facilities, and authorized the use of force if needed.&lt;ref name="ncpcbarchives.com"&gt;.&lt;http://www.ncpcbarchives.com {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207182404/http://ncpcbarchives.com/ |date=2011-02-07 }}&gt;.{{self-published source|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the Warren County protests, the 1984 Federal Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act focused on waste minimization and phasing out land disposal of hazardous waste as well as corrective action for releases of hazardous materials. Other measures included in the 1984 amendments included increased enforcement authority for EPA, more stringent hazardous waste management standards, and a comprehensive underground storage tank program.&lt;ref name="RCRA summary"&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-resource-conservation-and-recovery-act |title=Summary of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-01 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disposal of toxic waste continues to be a source of conflict in the U.S. Due to the hazards associated with toxic waste handling and disposal, communities often resist the siting of toxic waste landfills and other waste management facilities; however, determining where and how to dispose of waste is a necessary part of economic and environmental policy-making.&lt;ref name="ncpcbarchives.com"/&gt;

The issue of handling toxic waste has become a global problem as international trade has arisen out of the increasing toxic byproducts produced with the transfer of them to less developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Toxic_Waste.aspx|title=Toxic Waste Facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Toxic Waste|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights began to notice the illicit dumping of toxic waste and assigned a Special Rapporteur to examine the human rights aspect to this issue (Commission resolution 1995/81). In September 2011, the Human Rights Council decided to strengthen the mandate to include the entire life-cycle of hazardous products from manufacturing to final destination (aka cradle to grave), as opposed to only movement and dumping of hazardous waste. The title of the Special Rapporteur has been changed to the “Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes."(Human Rights Council 18/11). The Human Rights Council has further extended the scope of its mandates as of September 2012 due to the result of the dangerous implications occurring to persons advocating environmentally sound practices regarding the generation,management, handling, distribution and final disposal of hazardous and toxic materials to include the issue of the protection of the environmental human rights defenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Environment/ToxicWastes/Pages/SRToxicWastesIndex.aspx|title=Special Rapporteur on Toxic Wastes|website=www.ohchr.org|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
