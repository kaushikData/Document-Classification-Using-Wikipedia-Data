'''A21, Inc.''' (stylized as '''a21''') aggregates visual content from photographers, photography agencies, archives, libraries, and private collections; and licenses that content for its customers. The company's customers include advertising and design agencies, publishing and media entities, in-house communication departments and outside corporate communications firms, small and home office businesses, and the general public. The company sells its products directly and through a global network of 150 distributors in over 100 countries. It also markets its products through print advertising, direct mail, Web mail, and telemarketing.

==History==

Formed as an investment company in 2000, a21 acquired the stock photography agency [[SuperStock]] in 2004. They moved into SuperStock's headquarters in Jacksonville, FL and used SuperStock as a vehicle for further expansion. In 2005 a21 acquired Ingram Publishing Ltd., a UK-based provider of subscription and Royalty-Free images as well as vector graphics and fonts, vehicle outline templates, and print price guides. The following year they acquired ArtSelect, an Iowa-based provider of online technology and fulfillment infrastructure for retailers in the custom framed Art and Wall Décor market. In late 2007 they announced plans to launch a new Royalty-Free only brand named MediaMagnet; however the brand was not successful.  MediaMagnet images are now only available for sale through SuperStock.

In 2009, a21 auctioned off SuperStock, MediaMagnet, Ingram, and ArtSelect due to bankruptcy.

'''Adelaide Rosalie Hasse''' (September 13, 1868 – July 28, 1953) is listed as one of the "100 most important leaders we had in the 20th century" in the December 1999 edition of ''[[American Libraries]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kniffel | first1 = L. | last2 = Sullivan | first2 = P. | last3 = McCormick | first3 = E. | year = 1999 | title = 100 of the most important leaders we had in the 20th century | url = | journal = American Libraries | volume = 30 | issue = 11| page = 43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is credited with having developed the [[Superintendent of Documents]] Classification system used by the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] and [[Federal Depository Library Program]].

== Early life and library beginnings ==

Born in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], Hasse was the first-born of a surgeon of German ancestry, a fact of which she was very proud despite the negative impact it would have on her mid-career.  While there is no record of her ever formally attending school, it is assumed that she would have been educated through the local public school system.

Eventually Hasse's family made its way to southern [[California]] where she not only earned the title of "Champion Fast Lady Bicycle Rider of Los Angeles,"&lt;ref&gt;Beck, C. (2006). ''The new woman as librarian: The career of Adelaide Hasse.'' p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  but also obtained her first library job.  From 1889 to 1895, Hasse worked under the resolute tutelage of [[Tessa Kelso]], the Head Librarian at the [[Los Angeles Public Library]] (LAPL).  Hasse and Kelso became lifelong friends in their endeavors to collect, organize, and maintain libraries and their documents as well as making libraries, and the United States, in general, more equitable places for women to work and live.

== Los Angeles Public Library ==

When Hasse was hired on at the LAPL as "Addie Hasse," she dove into her work with a passion and eagerness that she managed to retain for the remainder of career.  In her first six years of library work, she and Kelso developed the LAPL's collection from 6,000 items to 42,000 items.  The two also worked to make the LAPL more user-friendly by offering free borrowing privileges, adding additional weekend hours, and allowing check-out of periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;   Later, they developed a librarian training course that was offered through the library.

When the library officially joined the [[Federal Depository Library Program]] in 1891, Hasse set to work on classifying its [[United States Department of Agriculture]] documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = G.K. | last2 = Richardson | first2 = John V. | last3 = Jr | first3 = | year = 1986 | title = Adelaide Hasse and the early history of the U.S. superintendent of documents classification scheme | url = | journal = Government Publications Review | volume = 13 | issue = | page = 82 | doi=10.1016/0277-9390(86)90030-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC) system was largely in use at this time, but it was not "suitable" for Hasse's needs.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 85&lt;/ref&gt;   She needed a more specific system, and one not classified by author as government documents frequently do not have an author listed beyond the department.  Classifying by department seemed to make the most sense; however, this proved equally problematic as many departments begin with the same word.  Thus, Hasse devised an inverted, departmental system for classification, e.g., "Agriculture, Dept. of" rather than "Dept. of Agriculture."  As her system for government documents differed significantly from the rest of the library's collection, which was organized by DDC, Hasse marked them as a special collection.

During her tenure at the LAPL, Hasse also organized the Santa Barbara, [[Santa Monica]], Pasadena, Riverside, and local normal school collections as well.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, 21&lt;/ref&gt;   She also began attending local and national conferences, publishing bibliographies with some regularity, was promoted to First Assistant, and began to go by "Adelaide R." rather than simply, "Addie."&lt;ref&gt;Beck, 17&lt;/ref&gt;   Early in her career, Hasse gained the attention of prominent librarians and made a rather notable name for herself in the field.

While Hasse's work with Kelso significantly improved many areas of the LAPL and earned them high marks with outsiders, the duo increasingly found themselves in trouble with the local library board.  The board, consisting of men, was unhappy with their frequent travel to conferences, living arrangements, and outspokenness on community issues.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  After enduring much harassment, pay decreases, threats to cut library funding, and general moral outrage from the board, Hasse and Kelso resigned from their positions in 1895.

== The Government Printing Office and the work that launched her career ==

Upon her departure from the LAPL, Hasse went to work in the newly formed [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] library program under Francis Crandall.  Her assigned task was to collect, organize, and classify government documents from its various departments, divisions, and bureaus.  Hasse set to work immediately, uncovering documents from all over [[Washington, D.C.]], even going so far as to look in ceilings and behind walls.  According to ''[[The New York Times]]'' article from 1897, Hasse's work "unearth[ing] the heap from the sub-cellar of the Interior Department" took "ten men and four teams six weeks' time to remove the mass to her office" from a room that had supposedly been sealed for almost two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Malcomb | first1 = L. | year = 2005 | title = Documents librarianship in Indiana: A historical review [Electronic version] | url = | journal = Indiana Libraries | volume = 24 | issue = 1| page = 14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Of this experience, Hasse reportedly exclaimed: "I dare say never had a young collector been given such an opportunity to revel in a very orgy of collecting."&lt;ref&gt;Malcomb, 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;   In fact, in just a little over a year, Hasse had "unearthed" 252,602 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = G.K. | last2 = Richardson | first2 = John V. | last3 = Jr | first3 = | year = 1986 | title = Adelaide Hasse and the early history of the U.S. superintendent of documents classification scheme | url = | journal = Government Publications Review | volume = 13 | issue = | page = 92 | doi=10.1016/0277-9390(86)90030-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once she had all of the documents, she had to come up with a way to classify them.  Building on her work with the Department of Agriculture documents at LAPL, she devised a system of letters and numbers that denoted the department, division, document type, and volume or series (if needed).&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;   This system is now generally referred to Superintendent of Documents Classification, or SuDocs.  While she was collecting and organizing, Hasse continued to regularly publish not only bibliographies of government publications, but also items of other interest such as  "Travel and Exploration" that appeared in ''List of Books for Girls and Women and Their Clubs''.&lt;ref&gt;Hasse, A. R.  (1895).  Travel and exploration.  In A. H. Leypoldt &amp; G. Iles (Eds.), ''List of books for girls and women and their clubs: With descriptive and critical notes and a list of periodicals and hints for girls' and women's clubs'' (pp. 55-59).  Boston, MA: The Library Bureau., p. 55-59&lt;/ref&gt;

Crandall eventually hired several catalogers to assist in the GPO's work; Edith Clarke was one such employee.  Right away, Clarke made it clear to Hasse that their relationship was one of associate, not of supervisor-employee.  In both Hasse and Clarke's personal documents, there are vague references to regular squabbling over whether SuDocs or DDC was a better system; Clarke favored the latter, though, and later declared that SuDocs was "indisputable for its special situation."&lt;ref&gt;Beck, pp. 48-51&lt;/ref&gt;   Hasse grew tired of Crandall's lack of recognition for her work and resigned from the GPO in March 1897.&lt;ref name="Beck, p. 56"&gt;Beck, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;   Hasse's worries about Crandall were not unfounded as he later accused her of stealing GPO documents and often publicly took the bulk of the credit for the system over which Hasse had so lovingly labored.&lt;ref name="Beck, p. 56"/&gt;   In the 1980s, Hasse finally received the GPO recognition she deserved when it named a room for her.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

== New York City==

Once again, Hasse left an unpleasant situation only to land in the beginnings of an organization.  Hasse had known [[John Shaw Billings]], Director of the recently reorganized [[New York Public Library]] (NYPL), for several years and was thrilled to take a position in NYPL's newly created Astor Library.  A reporter from ''The New York Times'' met Hasse on her second day of work and wrote an article entitled, "Miss Hasse's Unique Task."  In it, Hasse described her previous work at the GPO and her hopes for developing a public documents division in New York.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

When the NYPL consolidated its borough branches, it was said to have housed "one of the world's greatest collections of government publications," with items dating back to the American colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, pp. 70, 91&lt;/ref&gt;   Hasse's work developing and classifying this special collection garnered her praise from the top periodicals in the field, most especially from ''Library Journal'', for which she was a regular contributor.  As the leader in document classification, she was selected to serve on the ALA Committee on Public Documents in 1897, and from 1904–1908, even served as its chair.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Billings, like Kelso at the LAPL, was a warm, nurturing supervisor to Hasse, giving her free rein to work as she pleased.  Due to this freedom, she was able to track down the first book ever published in New York (1693), ''Narrative of an Attempt Made by the French of Canada Upon the Mohaque's Country,'' which, coincidentally, also happened to be the first government publication as it was written at the request of the governor.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;   As Hasse increasingly became a household name for librarians, it was only natural that librarians in the Federal Depository system would begin requesting her assistance in dealing with their own documents.  She even assisted [[Oregon]] employment lawyers in compiling information and documentation to support their cases against the state, as in ''Muller v. Oregon'' and ''Bunting v. Oregon''.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;   At a time when women were expected to be seen and not heard, once again, her actions won her more enemies than friends.

In 1911, Hasse was moved to the Documents Division of the NYPL where she was given the additional task of providing reference services, which greatly diminished the time she had available for working on NYPL's massive collection of government and municipal documents.  The Documents Division was closely related to the Economics Division, which was led by Charles Williamson.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;  It was at this point that Hasse's reputation as a misandrist and "classic difficult woman, selfish, bad-tempered, and unreasonable" began to unfold.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;  As she was passed over for promotions with some regularity, her less experienced male supervisors sought to undermine her authority and expertise in government documents at every turn.  In 1915, the Chief Reference Librarian, [[Harry Miller Lydenberg]], under new NYPL Director Edwin Anderson, launched a campaign against her, claiming that her entries were "erroneous or inconsistent."&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;  This campaign gathered steam and continued until her termination from the NYPL in 1919.  The beginning of the end for Hasse was when Anderson and Lydenberg removed her from her special collection to the Cataloging Division because they claimed that she "refused to 'coordinate' with the cataloging office on her work."&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;  After twenty years of cataloging government documents on her own, she was now little more than just another cataloging staff member.  Anderson eventually fired Hasse "via a two-sentence letter" and denied her request for a meeting as to why she was fired as well as for a hearing.  Patrons of the library were even told not to associate with her when she came in as a patron after her dismissal, and her supporters working in the library, as well as those she hired, were fired soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Anderson File ==

From 1917 forward, Hasse would struggle because of her German ancestry, support of the women's suffrage movement and equal pay and working conditions, desire to aggressively market library services, and lack of a husband. Anderson began keeping a file on Hasse, documenting every questionable move she made, even misconstruing legitimate inquiries to suit his needs. He reported her to the [[United States Secret Service]] in 1917 for "suspicious activity," which was largely due in part to her seeking other employment with President Wilson's Inquiry group.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Inquiry]] was formed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to "collect and organize information for the eventual peace conference" that would occur at the conclusion of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Hasse inquired about work with the group only to find that Lydenberg and Anderson were already heading it up in the basement of the NYPL. Anderson claimed that since she had been born to German parents (her parents were Americans of German heritage) and was at a conference in Germany when the war began, she could not possibly have any other motive for working with The Inquiry other than that as a German spy.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

The NYPL special collections division had an extensive collection of Latin American documents. There was, however, a gap in the collection, and in 1918, Hasse asked Anderson for permission to travel to [[Mexico]] on a vacation to California to collect the missing documents. Anderson again reported Hasse to the Secret Service for suspicious activity because this was during a time of great unrest in Mexico. She was denied permission to go to Mexico, but while she was in California, her house was searched by the Secret Service no fewer than four times over the course of six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1918, when the New York city police came to the library to inquire about possible suspicious activity by library employees, Lydenberg readily offered Hasse up to them, claiming she had ties to Jews, [[Marxism]], [[Trotskyism]], and [[Bolshevism]] because of a thank you note she had written to him regarding a "Marx book" a patron had requested.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1918, Anderson and Lydenberg hired Edith Clarke, Hasse's colleague from the GPO, who eagerly "came out against Hasse's work" and agreed that she was difficult to work with.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, pp. 238-239&lt;/ref&gt; The Anderson file also contained accusations that Hasse was a lesbian and was involved in a relationship with Tilloah Squires, an assistant Hasse hired in 1918 to work on the Foreign Relations Index.

As late as 1922, three years after her departure from the NYPL, Anderson was still reporting her to the Justice Department and even worked with [[J. Edgar Hoover]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) to open a file on her.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; The Anderson file is located in the NYPL Archives, which, in addition to the [[Library of Congress]], the [[National Archives and Records Administration]], and FBI, also has their own files on Hasse. As of 2006, the FBI still refuses to release five pages of their file on Hasse.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, 302&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life after the NYPL ==

For the first time in her career, Hasse was out of a job and had no immediate prospects for one.  From 1919 to 1923, she conducted research for the War Labor Policies Board, becoming an "expert in the Council of National Defense" and identified herself as a bibliographer rather than a librarian.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, pp. 289, 292, 296&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to found the School for Business Librarians within the Washington School for Secretaries and became editor of ''Special Libraries''.  She also wrote an autobiography entitled ''Compensations of Librarianship,'' in which she finally had her say against Anderson, Crandall, Clarke, and Lydenberg.

In 1923, she was hired on as a bibliographer for the [[Brookings Institution]] through 1932, at which time she was again out of a job, this time for a year. She finally obtained employment as an instructor at [[George Washington University]] and as a research consultant for what would later become the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), publishing bibliographies of Social Security information. From there she worked temporarily for the [[Temporary National Economic Committee]] (TNEC) and then as indexer for the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), and later still, as a bibliographer for the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].&lt;ref&gt;Beck, pp. 319-330&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lasting contributions ==

Hasse died on July 28, 1953, with a fifty-four year career in library and information science. In those fifty-four years, Hasse made a significant mark on the field as a library assistant, indexer, cataloguer, classifier, bibliographer, editorial analyst, and author. She was an advocate of "efficient and effective" library service, public access to government materials, and the women's movement.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Hasse overcame great obstacles in her quest for providing quick, easy access to materials. ''American Libraries'' states that she was best "known for her acerbic personality"; however, Gail K. Nelson and John V. Richardson, Jr., state that, regardless of what one may say of her professional relationships and personal life, the basis of the Superintendent of Documents Classification system still in use today was "essentially Hasse's."&lt;ref&gt;Kniffel, 43; Nelson, 94&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her work in the GPO, the American public has a system for easily accessing a century's worth of government publications and documents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3663">'''Alert messaging''' (or '''alert notification''') is machine-to-person communication that is important or time sensitive. An alert may be a calendar reminder or a notification of a new message.

Alert messaging emerged from the study of [[personal information management]] (PIM),{{Fact|date=April 2009}} the science of discovering how people perform certain tasks to acquire, organize, maintain, retrieve and use information relevant to them. Alert notification is a natural evolution of the concept of [[RSS]]{{Fact|date=April 2009}} which makes it possible for people to keep up with web sites in an automated manner. Alerting makes it possible for people to keep up with the information that matters most to them.

Alerts are typically delivered through a [[notification system]] and the most common application of the service is machine-to-person communication. Very basic services provide notification services via email or [[SMS]]. More advanced systems (for example [[AOL]]) provides users with the choice of selecting a preferred delivery channel such as e-mail, Short Message Service (SMS), instant messaging (IM), via voice through voice portals, [[desktop alerts]] and more. Novel approaches provide users with the ability to schedule their own alerts (for example [[Google Calendar]]). The most sophisticated service providers embrace all capabilities, aggregating a multitude of reminder, notifications and alert, catering the delivery system to the specific context of the content being delivered thus enabling users to create sophisticated scenarios.

==Alerts and spam==
The notion of content being delivered to users has received negative connotation over the years{{Fact|date=April 2009}} and is sometimes labeled as [[Spam (electronic)|spamming]], particularly for information that hasn't been requested by the user. The advent of technologies such as [[RSS]] and now alert notification are an effort directed to creating an antithesis to spam: the information being received by users is exclusively from opt-in requests.

==FCC==
The [[Federal Communications Commission]] is continually working to improve their ability to put in place a notification system in case of emergency, in an attempt to help protect citizens.{{Fact|date=April 2009}} The first system was the [[Emergency Broadcast System]], an emergency warning system in the United States, used from 1963 to 1997, when it was replaced by the [[Emergency Alert System]]. On April 9, 2008, the FCC approved an emergency alert text-messaging system so that cellular telephone users can get text message alerts in case of emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Batchelor|first=Laura |author2=Jennifer Rizzo|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/04/09/fcc.cell.phone.alert/index.html?eref=rss_tech/|title=FCC approves emergency alert text-messaging system|publisher=CNN.com|date=10 April 2008|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8374">'''Apple Open Directory''' is the [[LDAP]] [[directory service]] model implementation from [[Apple Inc.]] A directory service is [[computer software|software]] which stores and organizes information about a [[computer network]]'s users and network resources and which allows network administrators to manage users' access to the resources.

In the context of [[macOS Server]], ''Open Directory'' describes a shared [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAPv3]] directory domain and a corresponding authentication model composed of Apple Password Server and [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] 5 tied together using a modular Directory Services system. Apple Open Directory is a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of [[OpenLDAP]].

The term ''Open Directory'' can also be used to describe the entire directory services framework used by [[macOS]] and macOS Server.  In this context, it describes the role of a macOS or macOS Server system when it is connected to an existing directory domain, in which context it is sometimes referred to as ''Directory Services''.

Apple, Inc. also publishes an [[Application programming interface|API]] called the ''OpenDirectory'' framework, permitting macOS applications to interrogate and edit the Open Directory data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=OpenDirectory Release Notes at developer.apple.com | url=https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/releasenotes/OpenDirectory/OpenDirectoryRefUpdate/Introduction/Introduction.html | accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the release of [[Mac OS X Leopard]] (10.5), Apple chose to move away from using the [[NetInfo]] directory service (originally found in [[NeXTSTEP]] and [[OpenStep]]), which had been used by default for all local accounts and groups in every release of [[macOS|Mac OS X]] from 10.0 to 10.4. Mac OS X 10.5 now uses Directory Services and its plugins for all directory information. Local accounts are now registered in the Local Plugin, which uses XML property list (plist) files stored in /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/ as its backing storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Directory Services source code at www.opensource.apple.com | url=https://opensource.apple.com/source/DirectoryService/DirectoryService-621/ | accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation in macOS Server==
[[macOS Server]] can host an ''Open Directory domain'' when configured as an ''Open Directory Master''.  In addition to its local directory, this OpenLDAP-based LDAPv3 domain is designed to store centralized management data, user, group, and computer accounts, which other systems can access.  The directory domain is paired with the ''Open Directory Password Server'' and, optionally, a Kerberos realm.  Either provides an authentication model and stores password information outside of the directory domain itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mac OS X Server:  Open Directory Administration, page 40 |url=https://images.apple.com/server/pdfs/Open_Directory_v10.4.pdf |accessdate=2007-06-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315112121/http://images.apple.com/server/pdfs/Open_Directory_v10.4.pdf |archivedate=2007-03-15 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Kerberos authentication, the Kerberos realm can either be hosted by a Kerberos [[key distribution center]] (KDC) running on the server system, or the server can participate in an existing Kerberos realm.

For services that are not Kerberized, the Password Server provides the following [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer]]-based authentication methods:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mac OS X Server:  Open Directory Administration, page 50 |url=https://images.apple.com/server/pdfs/Open_Directory_v10.4.pdf |accessdate=2007-06-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315112121/http://images.apple.com/server/pdfs/Open_Directory_v10.4.pdf |archivedate=2007-03-15 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*  [[APOP]]
*  [[CRAM-MD5]]
*  [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]]
*  [[MD5|Digest-MD5]]
*  [[MS-CHAPv2]]
*  [[NTLM]] v1 and v2
*  [[NTLM|Lan Manager]]
*  [[WebDAV|WebDAV-Digest]]

Any [[macOS Server|Mac OS X Server]] system prior to 10.7 (Lion) configured as an Active Directory Master can act as a Windows Primary Domain Controller (PDC), providing domain authentication services to [[Microsoft Windows]] clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Server Admin 10.4 Help:  Setting Up a Server as a Primary Domain Controller | url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=ServerAdmin/10.4/en/c2wn5.html | accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directory services framework==
In a more general sense, Open Directory can describe the plugins model used by [[Directory Utility]] and the directory services framework in macOS and macOS Server.  This could be thought of as analogous to the [[Name Service Switch]] systems of some other [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s. When ''connected to a directory system'', a macOS client or Server can authenticate users, lookup contacts, perform [[service discovery]] and name resolution with the following types of directories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mac OS X Server:  Open Directory Administration, chapter 7 |url=https://images.apple.com/server/pdfs/Open_Directory_v10.4.pdf |accessdate=2007-06-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315112121/http://images.apple.com/server/pdfs/Open_Directory_v10.4.pdf |archivedate=2007-03-15 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Authentication and contacts
**  Microsoft [[Active Directory]]
**  [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAPv3]], including an Open Directory domain or RFC 2307-compliant system
**  Apple/NeXT [[NetInfo]] domains
**  BSD flat files and [[Network Information Service|NIS]]
* Service discovery and name resolution
** [[AppleTalk]]
** Windows (NetBIOS and [[Windows Internet Name Service|WINS]])
** [[Service Location Protocol|Service Location Protocol (SLP)]]
** [[Zeroconf|Multicast DNS (Bonjour/Zeroconf)]]

==History==
Open Directory began with Mac OS X Server 10.2. In this initial form, Open Directory consisted of a network-visible NetInfo directory domain and a corresponding Authentication Manager service for storing passwords outside of the directory.  Version 10.2 also included support for Kerberos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Apple - Mac OS X Server 10.2: How to Integrate Services With Kerberos | url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=107155 | accessdate=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mac OS X versions 10.1 and 10.0 stored user password information within the directory domain using crypt password authentication authorities, but version 10.2 paved the way for the current Shadow Hash and Password Server mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mac OS X Server:  Open Directory Administration, page 41 |url=https://images.apple.com/server/pdfs/Open_Directory_v10.4.pdf |accessdate=2007-06-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315112121/http://images.apple.com/server/pdfs/Open_Directory_v10.4.pdf |archivedate=2007-03-15 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Password Server is the successor to Authentication Manager, and was introduced in Open Directory 2 in Mac OS X Server 10.3.  Open Directory 2 was also the first version to use LDAPv3 as the directory domain.

Mac OS X Server 10.4 includes Open Directory 3, which introduced Active Directory domain member support, trusted directory binding, and increased robustness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Apple - Mac OS X Server - Open Directory | url=https://www.apple.com/server/macosx/technology/open-directory.html | accessdate=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mac OS X Server#Mac OS X Server 10.5 Leopard|Mac OS X Server 10.5]] features Open Directory 4 with support for cross-domain authorization and a built-in [[RADIUS]] server for managing [[AirPort]] base stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Apple - Mac OS X Server - Technology - Open Directory | url=https://www.apple.com/server/macosx/technology/open-directory.html | accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open Directory 4 no longer includes elements of NetInfo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AFP548 - Leopard Server Part 2 - Local Directory Services | url=http://www.afp548.com/article.php?story=LeopardServerReview-LocalDirectory | accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arabic Belt''' ([[Arabic]]: الحزام العربي al-hizām al-'arabi, [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]: Kembera Erebî که‌مبه‌را عه‌ره‌بی) was the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Syrian Baath government]]'s project of [[Arabization]] of the north of the [[Al-Hasakah Governorate]] that aimed to change the ethnic population composition in the [[Kurds in Syria|Kurdish regions of Syria]] in favor of the [[Arabs]].

==Planning==
The Baath party came to power in [[1963 Syrian coup d'état|1963 in Syria]] and decided in 1965 to build the 350 km long and 10-15 km wide Arabic belt along the [[Syria–Turkey border]]. The Belt was stretched from the [[Iraq–Syria border|Iraqi border]] in the east to [[Ras al-Ayn]] (Kurdish: ''Serê Kaniyê'') in the west. After another coup within the Baath party, [[Hafez al-Assad]] succeeded in becoming the head of Syria in 1970 and began to implement the plan in 1973. The project's name was officially changed to "Plan for the establishment of state model farms in the [[Upper Mesopotamia|Jazira region]]".{{r|"jAD34"}}

==Execution==
41 Arab villages were built in the course of time, and all the Kurdish village names of the area were replaced by Arabic names. About 4,000 Arab families from the provinces of Al-Raqqa and Aleppo, where they had previously lost their houses by the construction of the Tabqa dam, were accommodated in the new villages. These Arabs are named as Maghmurin (مغمورين Maġmūrīn, which is affected by flooding). In these measures, approximately 2 million hectares of Kurdish cultivated land were expropriated and awarded to the newly settled Arabs. According to the original plan, about 140,000 Kurds must also be deported to the southern near deserts at Al-Raad. Although the Kurdish peasants were expropriated, they refused to move away and give up their houses. Among these peasants, those who had been declared foreigners were not allowed to have property, to repair houses, or to build new houses.

==Background==
The Kurdish regions affected by the "Arab Belt" are rich in oil deposits and fertile agricultural land. About 50 to 60 per cent of the Syrian petroleum caves are estimated to be located in the district of [[Al-Malikiyah]].{{r|"YEP4e"}}

A [[Moro people|Bangsamoro]] [[sovereign state|state]] has been declared from the [[Philippines|Republic of the Philippines]] three times. A state was first declared in 1974. In 2012, Bangsamoro Land was declared. A year after, the [[Bangsamoro Republik|United Federated States of Bangsamoro Republik]] was declared.

===Reactions===

====National governments====
*{{flag|Philippines}} – The Philippine government refuses to recognize the Bangsamoro Republik, reiterating that theirs is the only legitimate government in the Philippine archipelago. Presidential spokesperson [[Abigail Valte]] said that the elected officials in the claimed territory of Bangsamoro still exercise control over their constituents. “Perhaps it’s time to go to the elected representatives of the people there [to see] if they support this call of Misuari [saying they] have declared themselves an independent state from the [Philippine] government,” she added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/08/16/1101351/philippines-debunks-declaration-bangsamoro-republik |title=Philippines debunks declaration of 'Bangsamoro Republik'|publisher=[[Philippine Star]] |date=August 16, 2013 |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Others====
*[[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] regional governor [[Mujiv Hataman]] said that all town mayors and provincial governments in the autonomous region remain loyal to the Philippine constitution. He described the Bangsamoro independence declared by Misuari unconstitutional. “All the elected officials of the region do not recognize Misuari’s declaration and they remain supportive of the national government's peace process with the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]],” Hataman said.
*[[Davao City]] mayor [[Rodrigo Duterte]] supports the idea of a Bangsamoro Republik. “Wala akong problema (I don't have any problem with it). I can work under a Muslim leader,” Duterte said. “Ang gusto ko lang it is fair to everybody. Kasi, pag hindi fair, ako ang magrerebelde. (My only desire is that it would be fair to everybody; if not, I will be the one to rebel.),” Duterte added. Duterte said that he would support Misuari's "legitimate" bid for independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/davao/local-news/2013/08/18/duterte-okay-moro-republik-298541 |title=Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte okay with Moro Republik |publisher=Sun.Star |date= |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the [[Zamboanga City crisis]], however, the Davao mayor clarified his stance and said that Misuari and his group are free to raise their MNLF flag in the Davao City "as long as it is not higher than the Philippine flag."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tempo.com.ph/2013/09/duterte-misuari-speak-on-phone |title=Duterte, Misuari speak on phone |publisher=Tempo.com.ph |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914044147/http://www.tempo.com.ph/2013/09/duterte-misuari-speak-on-phone/ |archive-date=September 14, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flagicon image|Bandeira Sultanato de Sulu Moderna.svg}} [[Sultanate of Sulu]] under [[Jamalul Kiram III]] - A Sultanate spokesman named Idjirani said that Sultan Jamalul Kiram III was not consulted on the declaration of the independence of Bangsamoro Republik.“That was his (Misuari) prerogative. But as far as Sabah is concerned, we are not in favor of that,” Idjirani said. The spokesman said that they had been hearing reports of Misuari's plan to declare independence and to bolster the strength of the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (MNLF). “Sultan Kiram’s instruction to our men on the ground is not to entertain such reports and not take part in any undertaking not authorized by the sultanate and the council,” he said. He also added that the Sulu Sultanate won't support Nur Misuari when he declares war on the Philippine government, despite the mutual disapproval by the Sultanate and Misuari's group of the [[Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro]] that triggered the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/sultanate-of-sulu-turns-its-back-on-misuaris-independence-declaration/30735/ |title=Sultanate of Sulu turns its back on Misuari’s independence declaration &amp;#124; The Manila Times Online |publisher=Manilatimes.net |date= |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planned future declarations==
In February 2015, Nur Misuari held a meeting with MNLF leaders in Sulu to inform them on the progress of declaring a "Bangsamoro Republik of Mindanao". Misuari also ordered the consolidation of MNLF troops following reports that government forces are launching a "secret all-out military operation” against armed groups not part of the peace process in Mindanao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Echeminada|first1=Perseus|title=Misuari fortifies stronghold in Sulu|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/02/20/1425665/misuari-fortifies-stronghold-sulu|accessdate=February 20, 2015|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Misuari accepted a federal system bid by the Philippine government, but with a condition that the Muslim Filipinos will have their own state under the proposed system. Philippines President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] supports Misuari's condition, along with the House Speaker and the Senate President. In 2017, Misuari offered aid to Duterte in his fight against [[ISIS]] in the [[Battle of Marawi]], which Duterte accepted.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rappler.com/nation/171253-duterte-misuari-mnlf-fighters-maute&lt;/ref&gt;

Being safety-conscious, each night the deceased’s husband slept with a loaded revolver under his pillow.  One night the revolver accidentally went off while the couple was sleeping; the bullet struck the deceased, who subsequently died.  The deceased’s husband was convicted of [[culpable homicide]]. 

The legal question arose of whether or not someone who negligently killed another may inherit in terms of the deceased's will. The court found that the answer was 'no'.

In general terms anyone may benefit from a will, however, an exception is made in the Roman-Dutch law:the [[court]] held that the [[Bloody hand|''bloedige'' hand]] rule, which means that no one may benefit from the death of their own victim,&lt;ref&gt;Beginner's guide for Law Students (Fourth Edition)&lt;/ref&gt; still applies and has not become obsolete by disuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678515 bloedige hand principle] at papers.ssrn.com.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, the deceased’s husband was not allowed to inherit but could take half of the common estate in terms of the [[Matrimonial regime|matrimonial property law]].

'''Chinese encyclopedias''' comprise both [[Chinese-language]] [[encyclopedia]]s and foreign-language ones about [[China]] or [[List of China-related topics|Chinese topics]]. There is a type of native Chinese [[reference work]] called ''[[leishu]]'' (lit. "categorized writings") that is sometimes translated as "encyclopedia", but although these collections of quotations from classic texts are expansively "encyclopedic", a ''leishu'' is more accurately described as a "[[compendium]]" or "[[anthology]]". The long history of Chinese encyclopedias began with the (222 CE) ''[[Huanglan]]'' ("Emperor's Mirror") ''leishu'' and continues with [[online encyclopedias]] such as the ''[[Baike.com|Baike Encyclopedia]]''.

==Terminology==
The [[Chinese language]] has several translation equivalents for the English word ''[[encyclopedia]]''.

''Diǎn'' [[wikt:典|典]] "standard; ceremony; canon; allusion; dictionary; encyclopedia" occurs in [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] such as ''zìdiǎn'' [[wikt:字典|字典]] "character dictionary; lexicon", ''cídiǎn'' [[wikt:辭典|辭典]] "word/phrase dictionary; encyclopedia", ''dàdiǎn'' [[wikt:大典|大典]] "collection of great classics; big dictionary"; and titles such as the 801 ''[[Tongdian]]'' ("Comprehensive Encyclopedia") and 1408 ''[[Yongle Dadian]]'' ("[[Yongle Emperor]]'s Encyclopedia").

''[[Leishu|Lèishū]]'' [[wikt:類書|類書]] (lit. "category book") "reference work arranged by category; encyclopedia" is commonly translated as "traditional Chinese encyclopedia", but they differ from modern encyclopedias in that they are compendia composed of selected and categorically arranged quotations from [[Chinese classics]], "the name encyclopedia having been applied to them because they embrace the whole realm of knowledge" (Teng and Biggerstaff 1971: 83).

''Bǎikē'' [[wikt:百科|百科]] (lit. "hundred subjects") in the words ''bǎikēquánshū'' [[wikt:百科全書|百科全書]] (with "comprehensive book") and ''bǎikēcídiǎn'' [[wikt:百科辭典|百科辭典]] (with "dictionary") specifically refer to  Western-style "encyclopedias". Encyclopedia titles first used ''Bǎikēquánshū'' in the final decades of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, Georg (2011), "China in European Encyclopedias, 1700–1850", in George Bryan Souza ed., ''European Expansion and Indigenous Response'', Brill, vol. 9, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|List of Chinese encyclopedias}}
Encyclopedic ''leishu'' anthologies were published in China for nearly two millennia before the first modern encyclopedia, the English-language 1917 ''[[The Encyclopaedia Sinica|Encyclopaedia Sinica]]''.

While English usually differentiates between ''dictionary'' and ''encyclopedia'', Chinese does not necessarily make the distinction. For instance, the ancient ''[[Erya]]'', which lists synonyms [[collation|collated]] by [[semantic field]]s, is described as a dictionary, a thesaurus, and an encyclopedia. The German sinologist Wolfgang Bauer describes the historical parallel between Western encyclopedias and Chinese ''leishu'', all of which arose from two roots, glossaries and anthologies or [[florilegia]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;The boundaries between both are quite fluid at first; the shorter the entries and the more exclusively they are directed to the definition of the word concerned, the more the work partakes of the character of a dictionary, while a longer commentary delving into history and culture and provided with extensive quotations of sources is, conversely, more characteristic of the encyclopaedia. The dividing line between a language lexicon (such as glossaries, onomastica and rhyming dictionaries) and a factual lexicon, to which all general and special encyclopaedias belong, is only clearly drawn when, in addition to the definitions, necessarily supported by literary references, an ''interpretation'' appears which takes into consideration not only the current literary usage but also the thing itself, which not only describes the subject but also, at times, evaluates and thereby forms a true connection between the new and the old. The very characteristic of the traditional Chinese encyclopaedia as in contrast to that in the West is that these distinctions were ''never'' clearly drawn. All Chinese encyclopaedias are anthologies, upon which were grafted greatly varying forms of dictionary arrangement. They consist of (generally quite long) quotations arranged in one order or another and, although they may include an opinion on the subject, they rarely contain an original opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Wolfgang (1966), "The Encyclopaedia in China", ''Cahiers d'Histoire Mondiale'' 9.1: 665-691.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robert L. Fowler, Professor of Greek at the [[University of Bristol]], says that although comprehensiveness is a primary criterion in defining an "encyclopedia", there are encyclopedias of individual subjects (e.g., ''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]]'') that defy the etymology from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''enkyklios paideia'' "the circle of subjects". He says, "To call a comprehensive treatment of one subject an "encyclopaedia" is a catachresis known already in medieval China, where the term ''leishu'', properly a collection of classical texts on many fields, came to be applied to similar treatments of one subject only, for instance the use of jade".&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Robert L. (1997), "Encyclopaedias: Definitions and Theoretical Problems", in P. Binkley, ''Pre-Modern Encyclopaedic Texts'', Brill, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial period===
{{main|Leishu}}
Chinese [[scholar-bureaucrats]] compiled about 600 leishu traditional Chinese "encyclopedias" between the 3rd and 18th centuries. About 200 of these are extant today, and 10-20 are still used by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Endymion (2000), ''[[Chinese History: A New Manual]]'', Harvard University Press, p. 602-603.&lt;/ref&gt; Most were published by imperial mandate during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907), [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279), [[Ming dynasty]] (1368-1644), and early [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1911). Some ''leishu'' were huge publications. For instance, the (1726) ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' contained an estimated 3 to 4 times the amount of material in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Robert L. (1997), "Encyclopaedias: Definitions and Theoretical Problems", in P. Binkley, ''Pre-Modern Encyclopaedic Texts'', Brill, p. 9; citing Diény, Jean-Pierre (1991), "''Les encyclopédies chinoises''," in ''Actes du colloque de Caen 12-16 janvier 1987'', Paris, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most scholars consider the 222 CE ''[[Huanglan]]'' (see below) to be the first Chinese ''leishu'' encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;Teng, Ssu-yü and Biggerstaff, Knight (1971), ''An Annotated Bibliography of Selected Chinese Reference Works'', 3rd ed., Harvard University Press, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Needham, Joseph|Needham]], [[Lu Gwei-djen|Lu]], and Huang call the late 4th to early 2nd centuries BCE ''[[Erya]]'' the oldest Chinese encyclopedia, and consider its derivative literature (beginning with the ''Fangyan'' and ''Huanglan'') as the main line of descent for encyclopedias in China.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph, Lu Gwei-djen, and Huang Hsing-Tsing (1986), ''Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 6 Biology and Biological Technology, Part 1 Botany'', Cambridge University Press, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The c. 239 BCE ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]'', which is an anthology of quotes from many [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] philosophical texts, is another text sometimes characterized as the first Chinese "encyclopedia". Although its content is "encyclopedic", the text was compiled to show rulers and ministers how to govern well, and was not intended to be a comprehensive summary of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Michael and Loewe, Michael (1993), "''Lü shih ch'un ch'iu'' 呂氏春秋", in Loewe, Michael, ''Early Chinese Texts: A Bibliographical Guide'', Society for the Study of Early China; Institute of East Asian Studies, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Han dynasty]], the 2nd century BCE ''[[Shiben]]'' ("Book of Origins") was the earliest Chinese dictionary / encyclopedia of origins. It explained imperial [[Genealogy|genealogies]], the [[Chinese surname#Origin of Chinese surnames|origins of surnames]], and records of legendary and historical inventors. Among subsequent encyclopedias of origins, the largest was Chen Yuanlong's&lt;!--陳元龍--&gt; 1735 ''Gezhi Jingyuan'' (格致鏡元, ''Mirror of Scientific and Technological Origins'').

Shortly after the fall of the Han dynasty, the first true Chinese ''leishu'' encyclopedia appeared. The 222 ''[[Huanglan]]'' ("Imperial Mirror"), which is now a [[lost work]], was compiled for [[Cao Pi]], the first emperor of the [[Three Kingdoms]] [[Cao Wei]] state (r. 220-226), in order to provide rulers and ministers with conveniently arranged summaries of current knowledge (like the ''Lüshi Chunqiu'' above).

An important new type of ''leishu'' encyclopedia appeared in the early [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907), after the administration made the [[imperial examination]] obligatory for all applicants into government service. Unlike earlier Chinese encyclopedias (such as the ''Huanglan'') that were intended to provide information for rulers and government officials, these new anthologies were intended for scholars who were trying to enter into government, and provided general information, and especially literary knowledge about the classics.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer (1966), p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the famous calligrapher [[Ouyang Xun]] supervised compilation of the 624 ''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'' ("Collection of Literature Arranged by Categories") encyclopedia of literature, which quotes 1,431 diverse literary texts. Specialized encyclopedias were another innovation during the Tang period. The 668 ''[[Fayuan Zhulin]]'' ("Forest of Gems in the Garden of the [[Dharma]]") was a [[Chinese Buddhist]] encyclopedia compiled by the monk Dao Shi 道世. The 729 ''[[Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era|Kaiyuan Zhanjing]]'' ("Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era") is a [[Chinese astrology]] encyclopedia compiled by [[Gautama Siddha]] and others during [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]]'s [[Kaiyuan era]] (713-741).

The Golden Age of encyclopedia writing began with the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), "when the venerated past became the general standard in Chinese thought for almost one whole millennium".&lt;ref&gt;Bauer (1966), p. 680.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'' were compiled by a committee of scholars under the supervision of [[Li Fang (Song dynasty)|Li Fang]]. First, the 978 ''[[Taiping Guangji]]'' ("Extensive Records of the Taiping Era") was a collection of about 7,000 stories selected from over 300 classic texts from the Han to the Song dynasties. Second, the 983 ''[[Taiping Yulan]]'' ("Imperial Reader of the Taiping Era") anthologized citations from 2,579 different texts, ranging from poetry, proverbs, and [[steles]] to miscellaneous works. Third, the 985 ''[[Wenyuan Yinghua]]'' ("Finest Blossoms in the Garden of Literature"), quotes from many literary genres, dating from the [[Liang dynasty]] to the [[Five Dynasties era]]. Fourth, the ''[[Cefu Yuangui]]'' ("Models from the Archives"), was the largest Song encyclopedia, almost twice the size of the ''Taiping Yulan''. Li Fang began compilation in 1005 while [[Wang Qinruo]] and others finished in 1013. It comprises quotes from political essays, biographies, memorials, and decrees. Another notable Song ''leishu'' encyclopedia was the polymath [[Shen Kuo]]'s 1088 ''[[Mengxi Bitan]]'' ("Dream Pool Essays"), which covers many realms of the humanities and natural sciences. The 1161 ''[[Tongzhi (book)|Tongzhi]]'' ("Comprehensive Records"), which was compiled by the [[Southern Song dynasty]] scholar Zheng Qiao 鄭樵, became a model for later encyclopedias.

The [[Ming dynasty]] period (1368–1644) was, in comparison with the Song period, of less significance for the history of Chinese encyclopedias. However, the [[Yongle Emperor]] commissioned compilation of the 1408 ''[[Yongle Encyclopedia]]'', which was a collection of excerpts from works in philosophy, history, arts, and sciences—and the world's largest encyclopedia at the time. The 1609 ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'' ("Pictoral Compendium of the Three Realms" [heaven, earth, and people]) was compiled by [[Wang Qi]] and [[Wang Siyi]]. This early illustrated encyclopedia comprised articles on many subjects including history, astronomy, geography, biology, and more, including a very accurate ''[[Shanhai Yudi Quantu]]'' [[world map]]. The 1621 ''[[Wubei Zhi]]'' ("Treatise on Armament Technology") is the most comprehensive military encyclopedia in [[Chinese history]]. The 1627 ''[[Diagrams and explanations of the wonderful machines of the Far West]]'' was an illustrated encyclopedia of Western mechanical devices translated into Chinese by the [[Jesuit]] [[Johann Schreck]] and the scholar Wang Zheng 王徵. [[Song Yingxing]]'s (1637) ''[[Tiangong Kaiwu]]'' ("Exploitation of the Works of Nature") was an illustrated encyclopedia of science and technology, and notable for breaking from Chinese tradition by rarely quoting earlier works. In Ming China, with the spreading of written knowledge to strata outside the literati, household ''riyong leishu'' 日用類書 ("Encyclopedias for daily use") began to be compiled, "summarizing practical information for townsfolk and others not primarily concerned with mastering the Confucian heritage."&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (2000), p. 602.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last great ''leishu'' encyclopedias were published during the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911). The 1726 ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' ("Illustrated Compendium of Literature, Ancient and Modern") was a vast encyclopedic work compiled during the reigns of Emperors [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi]] and [[Yongzheng Emperor|Yongzheng]]. The 1782 ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'' ("Complete Library of the Four Categories") was the largest Chinese ''leishu'' encyclopedia, and commissioned by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] in order to show that the Qing dynasty could surpass the Ming ''Yongle Encyclopedia''. This colossal collection contained some 800 million Chinese characters, and remained the world's largest encyclopedia until recently being surpassed by the [[English Wikipedia]]. The emperor ordered the destruction of 2,855 books that were considered to be [[Anti-Manchuism|anti-Manchu]], but were listed in the 1798 ''[[Siku Quanshu Zongmu Tiyao]]'' annotated catalog. The 1773 ''[[Vân đài loại ngữ]]'' ("Categorized Sayings from the Library") is a [[Chinese-language literature of Vietnam|Chinese-language]] Vietnamese encyclopedia compiled by the scholar [[Lê Quý Đôn]].

===Modern period===
Present-day Chinese encyclopedias—in the common Western sense of "comprehensive reference work covering a wide range of subjects"—include both printed editions and [[online encyclopedias]].

Among printed encyclopedias, the earliest was the (1917) ''[[The Encyclopaedia Sinica]]'' compiled the English missionary Samuel Couling. The 1938 ''[[Cihai]]'' ("Sea of Words") is a general-purpose encyclopedic dictionary that covers many fields of knowledge. The [[Zhonghua Book Company]] published the first edition, and the [[Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House]] issued revised editions in 1979, 1989, 1999, and 2009, making the ''Cihai'' a standard reference work for generations. The 1980-1993 ''Zhongguo Da Baike Quanshu'' or ''[[Encyclopedia of China]]'' is the first comprehensive (74 volume) Chinese encyclopedia. Compilation began in 1978, and the [[Encyclopedia of China Publishing House]] published individual volumes from 1980 through 1993. There is a 2009 concise second edition, as well as CD-ROM and online versions. The (1981–83) ''Zhonghua Baike Quanshu'' or ''[[Chinese Encyclopedia]]'' is a 10-volume comprehensive reference work published by the [[Chinese Culture University]] in Taiwan. An online version is also available. The 1985–91 Chinese-language edition ''[[Concise Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' or ''Jianming Buliedian Baike Quanshu'' is an 11-volume translation based on the Micropædia portion of the 1987 15th edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.

Among major online Chinese encyclopedias, for [[Standard Chinese]], the two largest both began in 2005, the [[Baike.com|Baike.com Encyclopedia]] and the [[Baidu Baike|Baidu Encyclopedia]]. There is the [[Chinese Wikipedia]] (2002–present), and for [[varieties of Chinese]], there are [[Cantonese Wikipedia|Cantonese]], [[Mindong Wikipedia|Mindong]], [[Minnan Wikipedia|Minnan]], [[Wu Wikipedia|Wu]], and [[Gan Wikipedia]]s, as well as the [[Classical Chinese Wikipedia]]. Lastly, there are modern English-language encyclopedias of China. For example, the 1991 2nd edition of the ''Cambridge Encyclopedia of China'', the 2009 ''Brill's Encyclopedia of China'', and the 5-volume 2009 ''Berkshire Encyclopedia of China''.

The '''''Chronicle of Cambridge''''' or '''''Cambridge Chronicle''''', also known as the '''''Tarʾīkh Jazīrat Ṣiqilliya''''' ("History of the Island of Sicily"), is a short, anonymous [[Middle Ages|medieval]] chronicle covering the years 827–965. It is the earliest native Sicilian chronicle of the [[emirate of Sicily]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Islamic Palermo and the Dār al-Islām: Politics, Society and the Economy (from the mid-9th Century to the mid-11th Century) |first=Annliese |last=Nef |publisher=Brill |year=2013 |pages=39–60 |encyclopedia=A Companion to Medieval Palermo: The History of a Mediterranean City from 600 to 1500}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was written from the perspective of a Sicilian Christian of the 10th or 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Muslims and Christians in Norman Sicily: Arabic-Speakers and the End of Islam |first=Alexander |last=Metcalfe |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It survives in two versions: a [[Byzantine Greek|Greek]] version in two manuscripts and an [[Arabic script|Arabic]] version in one.

{{italictitle}}
The '''''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba''''', or '''''Scottish Chronicle''''', is a short written chronicle of the [[Kings of Scots|Kings]] of [[Alba]], covering the period from the time of [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Kenneth MacAlpin]] (Cináed mac Ailpín) (d. 858) until the reign of [[Kenneth II of Scotland|Kenneth II]] (Cináed mac Maíl Coluim) (r. 971–995). [[William Forbes Skene|W.F. Skene]] called it the '''''Chronicle of the Kings of Scots''''', and some have called it the '''''Older Scottish Chronicle''''', but ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' is emerging as the standard scholarly name. 

The sole surviving version of the text comes from the [[Poppleton Manuscript]], now in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], [[Paris, France|Paris]]. It is the fourth of seven consecutive Scottish documents in the manuscript, the first six of which were probably put together in the early thirteenth century by the man who wrote ''[[de Situ Albanie]]''. The ''Chronicle'' is a vital source for the period it covers, and, despite some later [[Francization]], is very much written in [[Hiberno-Latin]], showing evidence of a scribe with some knowledge of contemporary [[Middle Irish language|Middle Irish]] [[orthography]]. The original text was without doubt written in [[Scotland]], probably in the early eleventh century, shortly after the reign of [[Kenneth II of Scotland|Kenneth II]], the last reign it relates.

{{Windows XP}}
{{Windows Vista}}
This page is a '''comparison of [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows XP]]'''. Windows XP and Windows Vista differ considerably in regards to their security architecture, networking technologies, management and administration, shell  and user interface, and mobile computing. Windows XP has suffered criticism for security problems and issues with performance. Vista has received criticism for issues with performance and product activation. Another common criticism of Vista concerns the integration of new forms of [[digital rights management|DRM]] into the operating system, and [[User Account Control]] (UAC) security technology.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==Compatibility==
Windows Vista faces [[backward compatibility]] problems with many of the [[video game|games]] and utility programs that work in Windows XP. As of July 2008, there were about 2,000 applications that specifically carried the 'Vista Compatibility Logo',&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/pages/windows-vista-service-pack-1-beta-whitepaper.aspx Windows Vista Service Pack 1 Beta White Paper], Windows Vista News&lt;/ref&gt; although the majority of applications without the logo will run without any problems. This number is low compared to the number of programs that can currently {{when|date=July 2016}} work under XP, either natively or in simulation modality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Performance==
Initial performance tests have demonstrated that Windows XP outperforms Vista in several productivity areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.co.uk/software/0,39029694,49294484,00.htm XP outperforms Vista in benchmark test], CNET&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crn.com/software/207001890 XP outperforms Vista in benchmark test], ChannelWeb&lt;/ref&gt; File copy operations are speculated to be one area where Vista performs better than XP.{{Clarify|date=June 2011}}&lt;!-- SMB 1.0 or 2.0? --&gt; In a test run by CRN Test Center, a 1.25 GB file was copied from a network share to each desktop. For XP, it took 2 minutes and 54 seconds, for Vista with SP1 it took 2 minutes and 29 seconds.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  The Vista implementation of the file copy is arguably{{Who|date=June 2011}} more complete and correct as the file does not register as being transferred until it has completely transferred; in Windows XP, the file completed dialogue box is displayed prior to the file actually finishing its copy or transfer, with the file completing after the dialogue is displayed. This can cause an issue if the storage device is ejected prior to the file being successfully transferred or copied in Windows XP due to the dialogue box's premature prompt.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Another test was performed by ''[[Tom's Hardware]]'' in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/xp-vs-vista,1531.html Windows XP vs. Vista: The Benchmark Rundown : Is Windows Vista Faster Than XP?], Tom's Hardware&lt;/ref&gt; Applications such as ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'' and the graphics [[benchmarking]] suite SPECviewperf 9.03 suffered heavily from the lack of support for the [[OpenGL]] graphics library under Vista. They reached the conclusion that Windows Vista clearly is not a great new performer when it comes to [[Execution (computing)|executing]] single applications at maximum speed. On the other hand, they did not find evidence that Windows Vista's [[Desktop Window Manager]] (DWM) consumes more energy than Windows XP's window manager. All of the tests were performed on a computer with a 2.93&amp;nbsp;GHz [[Intel Core 2 Extreme]] X6800 processor, 2× 1024 MB DDR2-800 [[random-access memory|RAM]], HIS Radeon X1900XTX IceQ3 [[graphics card]], 150 GB [[Western Digital]] WD1500ADFD [[hard disk drive|hard drive]] and a [[Gigabyte Technology|Gigabyte]] GA-965P-DQ6 [[motherboard]].

Scientific paper about [http://www.jucs.org/jucs_18_2/performance_evaluation_of_recent performance evaluation of recent Windows operating system performance] concludes that Windows Vista doesn't provide a better overall performance on the high-end computer system compared to Windows XP. Some performance improvements can be seen in memory management and graphics display, but other parts of OS have equal or lower performance than Windows XP. On the low-end computer system, Windows XP outperforms Windows Vista in most tested areas. Windows OS network performance depends on the packet size and used protocol. However, in general, Windows Vista compared to Windows XP shows better network performance particularly for the medium-sized packets.&lt;ref&gt;Martinovic, Goran; Balen, Josip; Čukić, Bojan, [http://www.jucs.org/jucs_18_2/performance_evaluation_of_recent/jucs_18_02_0218_0263_martinovic.pdf "Performance Evaluation of Recent Windows Operating Systems"], Journal of universal computer science. 18 (2012), 2; 218-263&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==
Security was a top priority during [[Development of Windows Vista|Windows Vista development]]. In Windows XP, every user is set up as an [[Superuser#Windows NT|administrator]] by default (unless added through Computer Management). As a result, most home users ran all their software with Administrator access. However, this left most users unwittingly open to potential security threats, such as hacking and [[malware]] downloads. A large amount of existing software doesn’t run well as a standard user, due to developers not implementing the [[principle of least privilege]] in their design and testing. For example, many poorly written applications often assume incorrectly that they will have read and write access to the entire filesystem and system [[Windows Registry|Registry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=288259 UAC - What. How. Why.], Channel9&lt;/ref&gt;  Denying such an application access to any of these assumed rights can cause the application to fail. Sometimes, a person logged on as a standard user under Windows XP can't perform user-specific tasks such as changing the [[system clock]] and calendar, changing the computer's [[time zone]], or changing the computer's [[power management]] settings due to so-called "LUA bugs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc160944.aspx|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|title=Problems of Privilege: Find and Fix LUA Bugs|date=August 2006|author=Aaron Margosis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:User Account Control.png|thumb|UAC credentials dialog]] --&gt;
[[User Account Control]] in Windows Vista improves this by limiting [[application software]] to standard user privileges until an administrator authorizes an increase in privilege level. In this way, UAC prevents users from making inadvertent changes to system settings and locks down the computer to prevent unauthorized applications from installing or performing malicious actions. Windows Vista is able to work around many LUA bugs in third party applications with its file and Registry virtualisation feature, as well as application compatibility [[Shim (computing)|shims]].  [[Internet Explorer 7]]'s Protected Mode utilizes User Account Control to isolate IE from other applications and prevent it from writing content to any location, except the ''Temporary Internet Files'' folder. Internet Explorer 7 is available for XP, but does not support Protected Mode on XP. Windows Vista also includes [[Windows Defender]], a spyware scanning and removal tool that is also available for Windows XP for free. Enterprise and Ultimate [[Windows Vista editions|editions of Windows Vista]] include [[BitLocker Drive Encryption]], which aims to help protect data in the case of stolen devices.

Vista implements [[address space layout randomization]], that makes it considerably more difficult for malicious code to exploit [[Return-to-libc attack]]s than on previous versions of Windows, particularly on 64-bit systems. Furthermore, Vista implements heap management enhancements that make it much more difficult to carry out [[buffer overflow]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-06/BH-US-06-Marinescu.pdf|title=Windows Vista Heap Management Enhancements|author=Adrian Marinescu|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=2006-08-03|accessdate=2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

64-bit editions of Windows Vista require all kernel-mode drivers to be digitally signed, initially making it difficult for [[rootkit]]s to install until [[Alureon]] managed to overcome this obstacle in 2010 by subverting the [[master boot record]].
{{clear}}

The firewall in Vista has been rewritten, allowing both outbound as well as inbound traffic to be blocked.&lt;ref&gt;https://technet.microsoft.com/nl-nl/library/cc755158(WS.10).aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shell and user interface==

===Visual styles===
[[Luna (theme)|Luna]] is the default [[visual style]] in [[Windows XP]]. It is available in three color schemes: Blue (default), Olive Green, and Silver. Windows XP Media Center Edition comes with [[Royale (theme)|Royale]] as the default theme.

In most editions of Windows Vista, the default theme is [[Windows Aero]]. Aero offers translucent window effects, as well as live thumbnails, animated transitions and [[Flip 3D]]. However, it requires a compatible graphics card, with a WDDM driver, [[DirectX]] 9 support and [[32-bit]] color; otherwise, Windows Vista is displayed using the "Windows Vista Basic" visual style.

{{ProgLangCompare}}

This comparison of [[programming language]]s compares the features of [[Syntax (programming languages)|language syntax]] (format) for over 50 computer programming languages.

== Expressions ==
Programming language [[Expression (programming)|expressions]] can be broadly classified into four syntax structures:

;prefix notation
* [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] &lt;tt&gt;(* (+ 2 3) (expt 4 5))&lt;/tt&gt;
;infix notation
* [[Fortran]] &lt;tt&gt;(2 + 3) * (4 ** 5)&lt;/tt&gt;
;suffix, postfix, or [[Reverse Polish notation]]
* [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] &lt;tt&gt;2 3 + 4 5 ** *&lt;/tt&gt;
;math-like notation
* [[TUTOR (programming language)|TUTOR]] &lt;tt&gt;(2 + 3)(4&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) $$ note implicit multiply operator&lt;/tt&gt;

== Statements ==
Programming language [[Statement (programming)|statement]]s typically have conventions for:

* statement separators;
* statement terminators; and
* line continuation

A statement separator is used to demarcate boundaries between two separate statements. A statement terminator is used to demarcate the end of an individual statement. Languages that interpret the end of line to be the end of a statement are called "line-oriented" languages.

"Line continuation" is a convention in line-oriented languages where the newline character could potentially be misinterpreted as a statement terminator. In such languages, it allows a single statement to span more than just one line.

*# collateral-clause using ''and-also-token'' (viz. “,”): '''begin''' a, b, c '''end''' – order of execution is to be optimised by the compiler.
*# parallel-clause using ''and-also-token'' (viz. “,”): '''par begin''' a, b, c '''end''' – units must be run in parallel threads.

=== Line continuation ===
Line continuation is generally done as part of [[lexical analysis]]: a newline normally results in a token being added to the token stream, unless line continuation is detected.

;[[Whitespace character|Whitespace]] – Languages that do not need continuations
* [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] – Lines terminate with semicolon
* [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] – Lines terminate with semicolon
* [[JavaScript]] - Lines terminate with semicolon (which may be inferred)
* [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]
* [[OCaml]]

;[[Ampersand]] as last character of line
* [[Fortran 90]], [[Fortran 95]], [[Fortran 2003]], [[Fortran 2008]]

;[[Backslash]] as last character of line
* [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]]&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html Bash Reference Manual],'' [https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Escape-Character 3.1.2.1 Escape Character]&lt;/ref&gt; and other Unix shells
* [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] preprocessor
* [[Falcon (programming language)|Falcon]]
* [[Mathematica]] and [[Wolfram Language]]
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.python.org/ Python Documentation], [https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html 2. Lexical analysis]: [https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#explicit-line-joining 2.1.5. Explicit line joining]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]
* [[JavaScript]] - only within single- or double-quoted strings

;[[Backtick]] as last character of line
* [[PowerShell]]

;[[Hyphen]] as last character of line
* [[SQL*Plus]]

;[[Underscore]] as last character of line
* [[Autoit]]
* [[Cobra (programming language)|Cobra]]
* [[Visual Basic]]
* [[Xojo]]

;[[Ellipsis]] (as three periods–not one special character)
* [[MATLAB]]: The ellipsis token need not be the last characters on the line, but any following it will be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_env/f0-5789.html Mathworks.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207151905/http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_env/f0-5789.html |date=7 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (In essence, it begins a comment that extends ''through'' (i.e. including) the first subsequent newline character. Contrast this with an inline comment, which extends ''until'' the first subsequent newline.)

;[[Delimiter|Comma delimiter]] as last character of line
* Ruby (comment may follow delimiter)

;[[Delimiter#Bracket delimiters|Left bracket delimiter]] as last character of line
* [[Batch file]]: starting a parenthetical block can allow line continuation&lt;ref&gt;https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-brackets.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ruby: [[brackets|left parenthesis, left square bracket, or left curly bracket]]

;[[Operator (computer programming)|Operator]] as last object of line
* Ruby (comment may follow operator)

;[[Operator (computer programming)|Operator]] as first character of continued line
* [[AutoHotkey]]: Any expression operators except ++ and --, as well as a comma or a period&lt;ref&gt;https://autohotkey.com/docs/Scripts.htm#continuation&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Backslash]] as first character of continued line
* [[Vimscript]]

;Some form of [[#Inline comments|inline comment]] serves as line continuation
* [[Turbo Assembler]]: &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;
* [[M4 (computer language)|m4]]: &lt;code&gt;dnl&lt;/code&gt;
* [[TeX]]: &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;

;Character position
* [[Fortran 77]]: A non-comment line is a continuation of the previous non-comment line if any non-space character appears in column 6.  Comment lines cannot be continued.
* [[COBOL]]: String constants may be continued by not ending the original string in a PICTURE clause with &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;, then inserting a &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; in column 7 (same position as the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; for comment is used.)
* [[TUTOR (programming language)|TUTOR]]: Lines starting with a tab (after any indentation required by the context) continue the previous command.

;[End and Begin] using normal quotes
* [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] preprocessor: The string is ended normally and continues by starting with a quote on the next line.

== Libraries ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

To '''import''' a [[software library|library]] is a way to read external, possibly compiled, routines, programs or packages. Imports can be classified by level (module, package, class, procedure,...) and by syntax (directive name, attributes,...)

;File import
* [[Active Server Pages|ASP]]: &lt;code&gt;#include file="''filename''"&lt;/code&gt;
* [[AutoHotkey]], [[AutoIt]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]]: &lt;code&gt;#include "''filename''"&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;#include &lt;''filename''&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* [[COBOL]]: &lt;code&gt;COPY filename.&lt;/code&gt;

* [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]: &lt;code&gt;require("''filename''")&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Mathematica]] and [[Wolfram Language]]: &lt;code&gt;Import["filename"]&lt;/code&gt;
* [[MATLAB]]: &lt;code&gt;addpath(''directory'')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an M-file (MATLAB source) to be accessible by name, its parent directory must be in the search path (or current directory).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Objective-C]]: &lt;code&gt;#import "''filename''"&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;#import &lt;''filename''&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Perl]]: &lt;code&gt;require "''filename''";&lt;/code&gt;
* [[PHP]]: &lt;code&gt;include "''filename''";&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;require "''filename''";&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Pick Basic]]: &lt;code&gt;include [filename] program&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;#include [filename] program&lt;/code&gt;

* [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]]: &lt;code&gt;include!( "''filename''");&lt;/code&gt;

;Package import
* [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]: &lt;code&gt;with ''package''&lt;/code&gt;
* [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]]: &lt;code&gt;#include ''filename''&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Cobra (programming language)|Cobra]]: &lt;code&gt;use Package.Name&lt;/code&gt;

* [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]: &lt;code&gt;require("''modname''")&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Mathematica]] and [[Wolfram Language]]: &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;''name''&lt;/code&gt;

* [[R (programming language)|R]]: &lt;code&gt;library("package")&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]: &lt;code&gt;import ''package''._&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;import ''package''&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]]: &lt;code&gt;import ''module''&lt;/code&gt;

;Class import
* [[Falcon (programming language)|Falcon]]: &lt;code&gt;import ''class''&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[MATLAB]], [[Kotlin (programming language)|kotlin]]: &lt;code&gt;import ''package''.''class''&lt;/code&gt;
* [[JavaScript]]: &lt;code&gt;import ''class'' from "modname";&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;import {''class''} from "''modname''";&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;import {''class'' as ''altname''} from "''modname''";&lt;/code&gt;

* [[Python (programming language)|Python]]: &lt;code&gt;from ''module'' import ''class''&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]: &lt;code&gt;import ''package''.''class''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;import ''package''.{ ''class1'' =&gt; ''alternativeName'', ''class2'' }&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;import ''package''._&lt;/code&gt;

;Procedure/function import
* [[D (programming language)|D]]: &lt;code&gt;import ''package.module'' : ''symbol'';&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;import ''package.module'' : ''altsymbolname'' = ''symbol'';&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]: &lt;code&gt;import ''Module'' (''function'')&lt;/code&gt;
* [[JavaScript]]: &lt;code&gt;import ''function'' from "modname";&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;import {''function''} from "''modname''";&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;import {''function'' as ''altname''} from "''modname''";&lt;/code&gt;
* [[MATLAB]]: &lt;code&gt;import ''package''.''function''&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Perl]]: &lt;code&gt;use Module ('symbol');&lt;/code&gt;

;Constant import
* [[PHP]]: &lt;code&gt;use const ''Namespace\CONST_NAME'';&lt;/code&gt;

The above statements can also be classified by whether they are a syntactic convenience (allowing things to be referred to by a shorter name, but they can still be referred to by some fully qualified name without import), or whether they are actually required to access the code (without which it is impossible to access the code, even with fully qualified names).

;Syntactic convenience
* [[Java (programming language)|Java]]: &lt;code&gt;import ''package''.*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;import ''package''.''class''&lt;/code&gt;
* [[OCaml]]: &lt;code&gt;open ''module''&lt;/code&gt;

;Required to access code
* [[Go (programming language)|Go]]: &lt;code&gt;import altname "''package/name''"&lt;/code&gt;
* [[JavaScript]]: &lt;code&gt;import ''altname'' from "''modname''";&lt;/code&gt;
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]]: &lt;code&gt;import ''module''&lt;/code&gt;

== Blocks ==
A '''block''' is a notation for a group of two or more statements, expressions or other units of code that are related in such a way as to comprise a whole.

;Braces (a.k.a. curly brackets) &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; ... &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;:

== Comments ==
[[Comment (computer programming)|Comment]]s can be classified by:
* style (inline/block)
* parse rules (ignored/interpolated/stored in memory)
* recursivity (nestable/non-nestable)
* uses ([[docstring]]s/throwaway comments/other)

=== Inline comments ===
Inline comments are generally those that use a [[newline]] character to indicate the end of a comment, and an arbitrary [[delimiter]] or sequence of [[token (parser)|token]]s to indicate the beginning of a comment.

Examples:

=== Block comments ===
Block comments are generally those that use a delimiter to indicate the beginning of a comment, and another delimiter to indicate the end of a comment. In this context, [[Whitespace character|whitespace]] and [[newline]] characters are not counted as delimiters.

=== Unique variants ===

==== Fortran ====
* Indenting lines in [[Fortran]] 66/77 is significant. The actual statement is in columns 7 through 72 of a line. Any non-space character in column 6 indicates that this line is a continuation of the previous line. A '&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;' in column 1 indicates that this entire line is a comment. Columns 1 though 5 may contain a number which serves as a label. Columns 73 though 80 are ignored and may be used for comments; in the [[Computer programming in the punched card era|days of punched cards]], these columns often contained a sequence number so that the deck of cards could be sorted into the correct order if someone accidentally dropped the cards. Fortran 90 removed the need for the indentation rule and added inline comments, using the &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; character as the comment delimiter.

==== COBOL ====
* In fixed format code, line indentation is significant. Columns 1–6 and columns from 73 onwards are ignored. If a &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; is in column 7, then that line is a comment. Until COBOL 2002, if a &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; was in column 7, it would define a "debugging line" which would be ignored unless the compiler was instructed to compile it.

==== Cobra ====
* Cobra supports block comments with "&lt;code&gt;/#&lt;/code&gt; ... &lt;code&gt;#/&lt;/code&gt;" which is like the "&lt;code&gt;/*&lt;/code&gt; ... &lt;code&gt;*/&lt;/code&gt;" often found in C-based languages, but with two differences. The &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; character is reused from the single-line comment form "&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; ...", and the block comments can be nested which is convenient for commenting out large blocks of code.

==== Curl ====
* Curl supports block comments with user-defined tags as in &lt;code&gt;|foo# ... #foo|&lt;/code&gt;.

==== Lua ====
* Like raw strings, there can be any number of equals signs between the square brackets, provided both the opening and closing tags have a matching number of equals signs; this allows nesting as long as nested block comments/raw strings use a different number of equals signs than their enclosing comment: &lt;code&gt;--[[comment --[=[ nested comment ]=] ]]&lt;/code&gt;. Lua discards the first newline (if present) that directly follows the opening tag.

==== Perl 5 ====
* Block comments in Perl 5 are considered part of the documentation, and are given the name [[Plain Old Documentation]] (POD). Technically, Perl 5 does not have a convention for including block comments in source code, but POD is routinely used as a workaround.

==== Perl 6 ====
* [[Perl 6]] uses &lt;code&gt;#`(...)&lt;/code&gt; to denote block comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.perl6.org/language/syntax#Comments |title=Perl 6 Documentation (Syntax) |at=Comments |publisher=docs.perl6.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perl 6 actually allows the use of any "right" and "left" paired brackets after &lt;code&gt;#`&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. &lt;code&gt;#`(...)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;#`[...]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;#`{...}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;#`&lt;...&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and even the more complicated &lt;code&gt;#`&amp;#123;{...}&amp;#125;&lt;/code&gt; are all valid block comments). Brackets are also allowed to be nested inside comments (i.e. &lt;code&gt;#`{ a { b } c }&lt;/code&gt; goes to the last closing brace).

==== PHP ====
{{Main article|PHP syntax and semantics}}

* PHP supports standard C/C++ style comments, but supports Perl style as well.

==== Python ====
* The use of the triple-(double)quotes although sometimes used to comment-out lines of source, does not actually form a comment. The enclosed text becomes a string, usually a string statement. Python usually ignores a lone string as a statement (except when a string is the first statement in the body of a module, class or function; see [[docstring]]).

==== Ruby ====
* As with Python and Perl, Ruby has no specific block-comment syntax. However, like Perl, documentation blocks can be used as block comments as they are ignored by the interpreter.

==== S-Lang ====
* The region of lines enclosed by the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#&amp;lt;tag&amp;gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#&amp;lt;/tag&amp;gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; delimiters are ignored by the interpreter. The tag name can be any sequence of alphanumeric characters that may be used to indicate how the enclosed block is to be deciphered. For example, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#&amp;lt;latex&amp;gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; could indicate the start of a block of LaTeX formatted documentation.

==== Scheme and Racket ====
* The next complete syntactic component (s-expression) can be commented out with &lt;code&gt;#;&lt;/code&gt; .

==== ABAP ====
ABAP supports two different kinds of comments. If the first character of a line, including indentation, is an asterisk (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;) the whole line is considered as a comment, while a single double quote (&lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt;) begins an in-line commet which acts until the end of the line. ABAP comments are not possible between the statements &lt;code&gt;EXEC SQL&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ENDEXEC&lt;/code&gt; because Native SQL has other usages for these characters. In the most SQL dialects the double dash (&lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;) can be used instead.

==== Esoteric languages ====
* Many [[esoteric programming language]]s follow the convention that any text not executed by the [[instruction pointer]] (e.g., [[Befunge]]) or otherwise assigned a meaning (e.g., [[Brainfuck]]), is considered a "comment".

=== Comment comparison ===
There is a wide variety of syntax styles for declaring comments in source code.
&lt;code&gt;''BlockComment''&lt;/code&gt; in italics is used here to indicate block comment style.
&lt;code&gt;''InlineComment''&lt;/code&gt; in italics is used here to indicate inline comment style.
&lt;!--NOTE: 20061101 ;; dreftymac
The indications of "block comment" and "inline comment" may not all be correct, if you see a mistake for a language you know, please change it.

'''''Continuum''''' is a public artwork by [[United States|American]] sculptor [[Charles O. Perry]]  located in front of the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in [[Washington, DC]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Continuum"&gt;{{cite web | author=Smithsonian | year=1993 | title=Continuum, (sculpture). | work=Save Outdoor Sculpture | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!6509~!0#focus | accessdate= 2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The sculpture is a large swirling abstract that consists of 8 bronze pieces painted black and placed on a pole. It moves freely.&lt;ref name="Continuum"/&gt;

==Information==
According to the artist the piece "began as an exploration of the [[Möbius strip]], a product of pure mathematics formed by joining two ends of a strip of paper after giving one end a 180 degree twist, thus creating only one edge. The center of the bronze sculpture symbolizes a [[black hole]], while the edge shows the flow of matter through the center from positive to negative space and back again in a [[continuum (theory)|continuum]]."&lt;ref name="CharlesOPerry"&gt;{{cite web | author=Charles O. Perry | year= | title=Biography | work= | publisher=Charles Perry | url=http://www.charlesperry.com/Bio.html | accessdate= 2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar sculpture by Perry, ''Continuum II'', is installed in [[Marina Square]] in [[Singapore]] and dates to 1986.&lt;ref name="Continuum II"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Continuum II | work=Singapore Public Art | publisher=Singapore Public Art | url=http://www.publicart.sg/?q=Charles-O-Perry_Continuum-II | accessdate= 2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition==
In July 2010 the piece underwent restoration to remove a green [[patina]] that formed on the sculpture. Perry's vision was for the piece to remain black. The piece was removed from its location to the west end of the building where it underwent its conservation by a contractor. The granite base that holds the 7,000 pound sculpture was also repaired.&lt;ref name="JulyRepair"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2010 | title=Continuum Sculpture Undergoes Restoration | work=AROUND NASM | publisher=National Air and Space Museum | url=http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs063/1101752115970/archive/1103512483603.html | accessdate= 3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1950">In [[Aztec mythology]], '''Coxcox''' was the only male survivor of a worldwide flood.&lt;ref name="Hale"&gt;{{cite book| last=Hale | first=Susan | year=1891 | title=Mexico | series=The Story of the Nations | volume=27 | location=London | publisher=T. Fisher Unwin | pages=22&amp;ndash;23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aztecs]] believed that only Coxcox and his wife, Xochiquetzal, survived the flood. They took refuge in the hollow trunk of a [[cypress]], which floated on top of the water and finally banked on a mountain in [[Culhuacán (altepetl)|Culhuacan]].&lt;ref name="Hale"/&gt;

They had many children, but all of them were mute. The great spirit took pity on them, and sent a [[dove]], which attempted to teach the children how to speak. Fifteen of them succeeded, and from these, the Aztecs believed, the [[Toltec]]s and Aztecs were descended.&lt;ref name="Hale"/&gt;

== Another account ==

In another account, the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] god [[Tezcatlipoca]] spoke to a man named Nata and his wife Nana, saying: "Do not busy yourselves any longer making ''[[pulque]]'', but hollow out for yourselves a large boat of an ''ahuehuete'' [cyprus] tree, and make your home in it when you see the waters rising to the sky."&lt;ref name="Hale"/&gt;

When flood waters came, the Earth disappeared and the highest mountain tops were covered in water. All other men perished, being transformed into fish.&lt;ref name="Hale"/&gt;

== The legend in art ==

Ancient Aztec paintings often depict the boat floating on the flood waters beside a mountain. The heads of a man and a woman are shown in the air above the boat and a dove is also depicted. In its mouth the dove is carrying a [[hieroglyphic]] symbol representing the languages of the world, which it is distributing to the children of Coxcox.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

'''Derek Holland''' is a figure on the [[Europe]]an [[far-right]] noted for his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Integralism]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Copsey, Contemporary British Fascism: The British National Party and the Quest for Legitimacy, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; 

Holland was brought up in Huntingdon and was already trying to recruit new members to the [[British National Front|National Front]] while a student at [[Anglia Ruskin University|Cambridgeshire College of Art and Technology]]. He then went to [[De Montfort University|Leicester Polytechnic]] to study history and to bolster support for the already-established Young National Front Student Organisation.&lt;ref&gt;''Bulldog'' (Paper of the Young National Front), #12, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; In the May 1979 general election, he contested [[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]] for the NF, receiving 311 votes (0.6%).&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 5 May 1979&lt;/ref&gt; After his studies Holland became closely associated with the [[Political Soldier]] wing of the party. One of the party's main writers in a time when their ideology was shifting, he contributed regularly not only to the party journal ''Nationalism Today'', but was also co-editor of ''Rising'', a radical nationalist journal that was independent of the NF and drew heavily from [[Julius Evola]] and [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, op cit, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Holland became one of the leading lights on the Political Soldier wing of the party when his pamphlet ''The Political Soldier'' was published in 1984. Along with [[Nick Griffin]] and [[Patrick Harrington]] he became effective joint leader of the [[Official National Front]] following the resignation of [[Andrew Brons]] from overall leadership in 1984. In 1988 the three travelled to [[Libya]] on a fund-raising trip as an official representatives of the NF, although in the end they were given only copies of ''[[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, op cit, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Holland broke with [[Patrick Harrington]] and joined Michael Fishwick in following [[Nick Griffin]] and [[Roberto Fiore]] into the [[International Third Position]] (ITP) after Harrington had contacted ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' with regards to opening dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, op cit&lt;/ref&gt; Holland injected his sympathies for [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] groups, as part of his nationalist philosophy, into the ITP. He supported the ideas of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]], who had previously featured on a cover of ''National Front News''.  

Holland's last public appearance was at a [[Sweden|Swedish]] nationalist convention in 2002, during this time Holland lived in the [[Midlands Region, Ireland|Irish Midlands]] where he sought grants from the local Community Enterprise Board for his involvement in the proposed publishing of the "IHS Books'' however when he sought to use a different address to his home address he was not seen for some time after that, his present whereabouts is unknown following his past involvement with Nick Griffin coming to light.
,   (hosted by [[Nationaldemokratisk Ungdom]], the youth wing of the [[National Democrats (Sweden)|National Democrats]]){{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. Since that time the ITP appears to have gravitated towards the [[European National Front]], and Holland has retired from active involvement in politics, although his Political Soldier writings are still circulated among radical nationalists. In 2001 Holland co-founded with John Sharp IHS Books, a publisher whose stated purpose was to bring back into print classics of Catholic social teaching but which has been accused of fascist and anti-semitic connections.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Blosser, "IHS Press, Potential Fascist &amp; Antisemitic Connections, Etc." http://www.ratzingerfanclub.com/blog/2006/02/ihs-press-potential-fascist.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Holland has received considerable treatment in works on [[Europe]]an [[extremist]] [[nationalism]], including ''[[Fascism]]: A History'' by Roger Eatwell (1997) and ''Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity'' by [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] (2002). Holland’s writings on the Political Soldier are also featured in ''Fascism: A Reader'' published by [[Oxford University Press]] (1995).

'''Robert Herman Julius Friedrich''' (June 30, 1891 – August 8, 1966), better known by the [[ring name]] '''Ed "Strangler" Lewis''', was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]].

During his professional wrestling career, which spanned four decades, Lewis was a [[World Heavyweight Wrestling Championship (original version)#Title history|four-time]] [[World Heavyweight Wrestling Championship (original version)|World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion]].

== Professional wrestling career ==
[[File:Ed 'Strangler' Lewis in the ring cph.3b19139.jpg|thumb|left|Lewis wrestles Ivan Linow in 1920]]
Born in [[Nekoosa, Wisconsin]], Friedrich began wrestling at the age of 14, using the ring name Ed "Strangler" Lewis, first in Louisville, Kentucky in tribute of 1890s star [[Evan "Strangler" Lewis]].&lt;ref name=p61&gt;''National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling'', p. 61, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also stated in the [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] documentary ''The Unreal Story of Professional Wrestling'' that he was dubbed the Strangler after a match in France where he applied a [[Rear naked choke#.22Sleeper Hold.22 in professional wrestling|sleeper hold]], and the French, who were unfamiliar with the hold, thought he was strangling his opponent.

He was the pivotal figure in the "[[Gold Dust Trio]]", along with [[Professional wrestling promoter|promoters]] [[Toots Mondt]] and [[Billy Sandow|Big Billy Sandow]], a travelling road show that was the precursor to wrestling tours, and which revolutionized professional wrestling by creating [[Card (sports)#Undercard|undercards]], promoting full events instead of one match shows. They also developed the first professional wrestling [[Angle (professional wrestling)|storylines]], creating [[Work (professional wrestling)|worked]] [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuds]] between wrestlers. Because of the legit skills Lewis possessed, the Trio could put the [[Professional wrestling championship|title]] on who ever they wanted, because Lewis had the ability to defeat [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|anyone who would not follow the script]].

Lewis captured his first recognized [[World Heavyweight Wrestling Championship (original version)|World Heavyweight Wrestling Championship]] on December 13, 1920, defeating [[Joe Stecher]]. Stecher would prove to be Lewis' biggest rival, both in and out of the ring, with Stecher running his own shows against the Gold Dust Trio, beginning quite possibly the first promotional rivalry. Lewis and Stecher wrestled one of the longest matches in professional wrestling history, where they battled for five and a half hours, ending in a [[Professional wrestling#Draw|draw]]. The climax of their feud came on April 15, 1925, when Gold Dust Trio star and former champion [[Stanislaus Zbyszko]] was asked to lose to the Gold Dust Trio's own handpicked champion, [[Wayne Munn]], a former football star, in an effort to give Munn credibility. Zbyszko balked at the idea of losing to an unskilled wrestler, and secretly jumped to the Joe Stecher camp. Zbyszko double-crossed the Gold Dust Trio, using his knowledge of holds to [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legit]] defeat and, in the process, humiliate Munn. Eventually, Lewis and Stecher settled their differences, and agreed to do business with each other, with Stecher [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#D|dropping]] the [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world title]] back to Lewis on February 20, 1928.

In 1931, Lewis and partner, [[Billy Sandow]], signed former Notre Dame All-American running back [[Joe_Savoldi|"Jumping Joe" Savoldi]] to his first professional wrestling contract.  Lewis was credited with training Savoldi in Los Angeles during the first half of 1931.  

In 1933, one of the Strangler's most infamous matches took place in [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]]. He was fighting [[Peter Sauer|Ray Steele]] for the title. The two men began circling each other, but no fighting happened, which made the fans bored. Steele finally ended the match by punching Lewis, causing the referee to [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualify]] him twenty minutes into the match.

On September 20, 1934, Lewis wrestled [[Jim Londos]] in front of an audience of 35,275 at Wrigley Field, and drawing a record gate of $96,302, which would stand until 1952.&lt;ref name=p73&gt;''National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling'', p. 73, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1937, the Strangler had six contests in New Zealand. He beat Floyd Marshall, [[John Spellman]], [[Glen Wade]], and [[Rusty Wescoatt]], and lost twice to the Canadian champion [[Earl McCready]], who was then established as the top wrestler in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fighttimes.com/magazine/magazine.asp?article=267|title=World Champions in New Zealand|author=Dave Cameron|work=fighttimes.com|date=October 1, 2005|accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post wrestling ==
Lewis went into semi-retirement in 1935, but came out of retirement in 1942, at the age of 51, despite being legally blind. He retired from professional wrestling for good in 1948, at 57 years old. At the November 1949 NWA Convention in St. Louis, Lewis was named the ambassador of good will for the NWA.&lt;ref name=p75&gt;''National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling'', p. 75, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, he would become the [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] of his good friend and reigning [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]], Lou Thesz.&lt;ref name=p75/&gt;

Lewis went blind from [[trachoma]].&lt;ref name=p76&gt;''National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling'', p. 76, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellison, Lillian|title=The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle|year=2003|isbn=978-0-06-001258-8|publisher=ReaganBooks|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was destitute and relied on his wife and acquaintances to survive. He died in [[New York City|New York]] on August 8, 1966 at the age of 75. In 1999, Lewis was inducted into the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Hall of Fame. Today, a [[Wisconsin]] state [[historical marker]] commemorates his achievements in his hometown of Nekoosa on Prospect Avenue.&lt;ref name=p76/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=1963|title=Ed "Strangler" Lewis Marker|work=hmdb.org|accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Lewis was voted in by professional wrestlers, historians and writers and inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in Amsterdam, New York.

'''Edward Brodhead Green''' (May 10, 1855 – February 2, 1950), very often referred to as '''E. B. Green''', was a major American architect from New York State.&lt;ref name="Corcoran1989"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corcoran|first1=Kathryn L.|title=Edward B. Green, Architect: A Selected Bibliography|date=1989|publisher=Vance Bibliographies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNg3AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=21 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Green was born in [[Utica, New York]] on May 10, 1855.&lt;ref name="EBGObit1950"/&gt;

He attended [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Architecture|bachelor of architecture]] degree in 1878.  Following his graduation, Green was the 8th architect to be registered by the [[State University of New York]].&lt;ref name="EGBbuffaloah"/&gt;

==Career==
After graduation, Green worked as a junior architect with William Miller in Ithaca for three years while teaching at Cornell for one year.  In 1880, along with [[William Sydney Wicks]], an [[M.I.T.]] architecture graduate, he opened a practice in [[Auburn, New York]], moving a year later to 69 Genesee Street in [[Buffalo, New York]] in 1881.&lt;ref name="EGBbuffaloah"/&gt;

Green was thereafter active in [[Buffalo, New York]] through about 1930 where his work left a lasting impression on the city of Buffalo,&lt;ref name="Goldman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldman|first1=Mark|title=City on the Edge: Buffalo, New York, 1900 - Present|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=9781615920679|page=88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=snvS2LYJCTgC&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=21 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it includes such noteworthy structures as the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]], [[Young Men's Christian Association Central Building]], and [[Twentieth Century Club (Buffalo, New York)|Twentieth Century Club]] (1894); all three listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Western Architect and Engineer|date=1908|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZ5DAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=21 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His public buildings include the [[Buffalo Savings Bank]], the Market Arcade, the Buffalo Crematory, and South Park High School, [[First Presbyterian Church (Buffalo, New York)|The First Presbyterian Church of Buffalo]], [[Kibler High School]], [[Tonawanda Municipal Building]], and [[Dayton Art Institute]] (1930) among others.&lt;ref name="architectsincanada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Green, Edward Brodhead|url=https://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/749|website=dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org|publisher=Biographical Dictionary of Architects in Canada|accessdate=21 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, Green made the designs for several structures owned by the [[Ontario Power Company]] at [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="architectsincanada"/&gt;

He also designed and built many private residences, including the [[Charles W. Goodyear]] [[Charles W. Goodyear House|Residence]], the [[Granger Mansion]], and his own residence at 180 Summer Street,  which is not visible from the road.  During his 72-year career, he designed more than 370 major structures. More than 160 of his Buffalo buildings survive today.&lt;ref name="architectsincanada"/&gt;

After the death of his partner Wicks in 1919, he continued the practice with his son, Edward B. Green Jr., and then with R.M. James from 1936 to 1950.&lt;ref name="architectsincanada"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1887, Green was married to Harriet Edson (1858–1935). Together, they were the parents of:&lt;ref name="EGBbuffaloah"/&gt;

* Edward Brodhead Green, Jr. (1888–1933), also an architect.&lt;ref name="architectsincanada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Banham1981"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banham|first1=Reyner|last2=Kowsky|first2=Francis R.|last3=Corporation|first3=Buffalo Architectural Guidebook|title=Buffalo Architecture: A Guide|date=1981|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=9780262520638|page=120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gAwO1bacaqIC&amp;pg=PA120|accessdate=21 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a classic piece of climbing literature, known to many climbers as simply "The Book",&lt;ref name=quotable&gt;{{cite book |title=The Quotable Climber |author=Jonathan Waterman |publisher=Globe Pequot |year=2002 |pages=97–99 |isbn=1-58574-542-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-uHNav4Y-TYC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has served as an inspiration for more recent climbing books, such as Mark Kroese's ''Fifty Favorite Climbs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fifty Favorite Climbs: The Ultimate North American Tick List |author=Mark Kroese |publisher=The Mountaineers Books |year=2001 |isbn=0-89886-728-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though much of the book's contents are now out of date, it is still recognized as a definitive text which goes beyond the traditional guidebook.

The first edition was published in 1979, by [[Sierra Club Books]] in the United States and in Great Britain by the now defunct Diadem Books.  This was followed by a paperback printing by Random House in 1981.  Two subsequent editions (with the same content) were published by Sierra Club Books in 1982 and 1996.  Between 1979 and 1999 it sold nearly thirty thousand copies, a considerable achievement for a climbing guide book.&lt;ref name=quotable/&gt;

Reviewing the book in ''[[American Alpine Journal]]'', [[Fred Beckey]] wrote: "Roper and Steck have presented a profile of what could be considered the Great American Dream climbs with a writing style that provides much ''Lebensraum'' for speculation and meditation. While reading, one is tempted to meditate: the challenge of the alpine adventure is always there; the dreams of the various pioneers sometimes filter through the narrative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fifty Classic Climbs of North America (review) |author=Fred Beckey |journal=American Alpine Journal |year=1980 |pages=663–665 |url=http://www.americanalpineclub.org/documents/pdf/aaj/1980/661_reviews_aaj1980.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roper and Steck received the [[American Alpine Club]]'s 1995 Literary Award for the book and for their other works such as ''The Best of Ascent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=Allen Steck: Fifty Classic Climbs |people=Allen Steck, John Martin Meek (interviewer) |date=December 3, 1995 |url=https://archive.org/details/AllenSteckInterview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To choose the list of climbs, the coauthors solicited opinions from a number of leading climbers of the era, narrowing a list of more than 100 climbs according to three basic criteria: that the peak or route appear striking from afar, have a noteworthy climbing history, and offer climbing of excellent quality. Precedence was given to climbing quality over appearance, and appearance over historical significance. In order to judge historical significance and continuing popularity, routes were limited for the most part to those first ascended before 1970. A lower limit on the length of the route, at 500 feet, was also established. Steck and Roper had personally ascended or attempted most of the selected routes.&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Classic Climbs'', "Introduction", pp. ix-xi&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of fifty climbs has served as a challenge to climbers, providing them with a "tick list" of challenging routes that span a wide section of western North America. Author Steve Roper has emphasized that the climbs were chosen from a list of about 120 climbs he and Steck considered classic, and are simply '50 classic climbs', not '''the'' 50 classics'.&lt;ref name=quotable/&gt; Nevertheless, the book brought great popularity to many of the routes it featured, and prospective climbers pursuing one of the "fifty classics" often found crowds on the more accessible climbs and unexpected company on the more remote routes, earning them the nickname "Fifty Crowded Climbs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fifty Crowded Climbs |author=George Bell |journal=Ascent |volume= |issue=89 |pages= |url=http://home.comcast.net/~gibell/trip_reports/50cc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No one person has yet climbed all fifty routes. This has been attributed to the difficulty of some of the Alaskan and Canadian routes (the Hummingbird Ridge of [[Mount Logan]] has never been repeated by the original route&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climbing.com/news/hotflashes/60hardrockclassics/ |title=60 British Classics in 36 Days |author=Dougald MacDonald |publisher=''Climbing'' |accessdate=2008-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''Flora Australiensis: a description of the plants of the Australian Territory''''', more commonly referred to as '''''Flora Australiensis''''', and also known by its standard abbreviation '''''Fl. Austral.''''',&lt;ref name="IPNI"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ipni.org/ipni/idPublicationSearch.do?id=921-2 | title =  Flora Australiensis: a description… | work = International Plant Names Index ([[IPNI]]) | accessdate = 2007-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a seven-volume [[flora]] of [[Australia]] published between 1863 and 1878 by [[George Bentham]], with the assistance of [[Ferdinand von Mueller]]. It was one of the famous [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew]] series of colonial floras, and the first flora of any large continental area that had ever been finished. In total the flora included descriptions of 8125 species.&lt;ref name = "Orchard"&gt;Orchard, A. E. 1999. Introduction. In A. E. Orchard, ed. ''Flora of Australia - Volume 1'', 2nd edition pp 1-9. Australian Biological Resources Study {{ISBN|0-643-05965-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bentham prepared the flora from Kew; with Mueller, the first plant taxonomist residing permanently in Australia, loaning the entire collection of the [[National Herbarium of Victoria]] to Bentham over the course of several years. Mueller had been dissuaded from preparing a flora from Australia while in Australia by Bentham and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] since historic collections of Australian species were all held in European herbaria which Mueller could not access from Australia.&lt;ref name = "Orchard"/&gt; Mueller did eventually produce his own flora of Australia, the ''[[Systematic Census of Australian Plants]]'' published in 1882 extended the work of Bentham with the addition of new species and taxonomic revisions.

''Flora Australiensis'' was the standard reference work on the Australian flora for more than a century. As late as 1988, [[James Hamlyn Willis|James Willis]] wrote that "''Flora Australiensis'' still remains the only definitive work on the vascular vegetation of the whole continent."&lt;ref name="Willis 1988"&gt;{{cite conference | author = James Willis | year = 1990 | title = Melbourne: a focal point for early botanical activity | conference = History of Systematic Botany in Australasia | url = http://www.anbg.gov.au/asbs/publications/history-willis.html | accessdate = 2007-03-26 | authorlink = James Hamlyn Willis}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nancy Burbidge]], "it represents a prodigious intellectual effort never equalled."&lt;ref name="ADB Bentham"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A030138b.htm | title =  Bentham, George (1800 - 1884) | work = [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] | publisher = Melbourne University Press | accessdate = 2007-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Flora Australiensis'' is credited with forming the basis of subsequently published regional floras; 19th century floras were published for all states except Western Australia, they were for the most part extracts of this work. &lt;ref name = "Orchard"/&gt;

'''Honk''' was a social automotive website developer headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company was co-founded by Tom Taira and Stephanie LaCrosse in 2009 to develop web and mobile [[solution]]s that enabled consumers to choose a car.

Honk operated Honk.com, a website that featured user-generated car reviews, new car pricing information, and several [[social shopping]] features.&lt;ref&gt;Thrillist, 2009-11-20, [http://www.thrillist.com/nation/glyde Honk: Using who you are to pick your next car], Retrieved 2010-07-28&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[beta version]] of Honk.com was launched in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Roeder, About.com, 2009-11-18, [http://personalweb.about.com/b/2009/11/18/tell-your-car-stories-on-facebook.htm Tell Your Car Stories on Facebook], Retrieved 2010-07-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Honk’s “social recommendation engine” enabled consumers to find recommendations on cars based on their [[demographic]] and [[psychographic]] backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;FHM.com, 2010-02, [http://www.fhmonline.com/Site/Content/Article.aspx?ID=43036 Honk.com helps us decode women], Retrieved 2010-07-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger H, Killer Startups, 2009-11, [http://www.killerstartups.com/Web20/honk-com-finding-the-right-car-for-you Honk.com – Finding the Right Car for You], Retrieved 2010-07-19&lt;/ref&gt; Using its social search tool, Honk users could input their age, sex, favorite hobbies, etc. and the social recommendation engine then looked to see which car models were most preferred by other people with the same characteristics.  The Honk database featured anonymous data from several hundred thousand automobile shoppers and buyers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Warren, Mashable, 2009-12-02, [http://mashable.com/2009/11/05/honk/ Honk: Car Shopping with a Social Twist], Retrieved 2010-07-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Fetzer, [[SheKnows Media|SheKnows.com]], 2010-05, [http://www.sheknows.com/articles/815452/page:1 Top 21 Best Cars for Teens], Retrieved 2010-07-19&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Imaginative Sex''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book by [[John Norman]] which includes a list of [[Male dominance (BDSM)|male-dominant]] heterosexual [[BDSM]]-type [[sexual fantasy]] scenarios, and suggested guidelines as to how a couple can act them out in order to improve their sex life. 

==Publication==
First published in paperback form in 1974 by fiction publisher [[DAW Books]], the then-publisher of Norman's [[Gor]] series (and distributed through the same channels as the science-fiction and fantasy paperbacks in DAW's line), the book was republished in 1997 with a new foreword by noted BDSM author [[Pat Califia]].  According to Califia, the original 1974 edition of the book "was one of the first above-ground nonfiction books to offer a rationalization for dominant/submissive role-playing and some instructions about how to do it".  However, the book does not use the terminology which later became common in BDSM circles "for the very simple reason that the jargon and conventions we take for granted had not been created when he wrote the book". While Norman focuses exclusively on male-dominant heterosexual couples, "''Imaginative Sex'' could, however, be used by readers of any sexual orientation or gender", according to Califia, since "Norman is very good at pinpointing archetypal situations that are ideal for building the tension and polarization crucial to a good scene" and "It's fairly easy to adapt these scenarios to any [[Sado-masochism|S/M]] or [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|D/S]] relationship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Violence and Utopia: John Norman and Pat Califia|work=Utopian Studies|date=2000-01-01|author=Peter Fitting|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7051/is_1_11/ai_n28818960/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foreword"&gt;"No Fantasy, Please, We're Americans: A Foreword by a Feminist", introduction by Pat Califia to 1997 edition of ''Imaginative Sex''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline==
In the book, Norman states that one of his goals as a writer is to allow people's imaginations to become "sexually liberated". He encourages married couples to use sexual fantasies and role playing in order to enliven their sex lives and explore the mental and spiritual aspects of [[sexual intercourse]].  While Norman defends his male-dominant psycho-sexual theories (which also underlie the Gor books), it is notable that he does not advise couples to attempt to adopt the customs and institutions of the fictional planet Gor in any literal or simplistic way.  Norman places more emphasis on "[[Pair bond|pair-bonding]]" and stable heterosexual relationships than in the Gor books, and when fantasy-scenario whippings are to be enacted, for example, Norman recommends that the man sharply clap his hands together, "while the slave reacts as if being whipped".&lt;ref name="foreword"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theadvocates.org./celebrities/john-norman.html|title=John Norman &amp;mdash; Libertarian|author=Bill Winter|publisher=Advocates for Self-Government|date=2007-05-20|accessdate=2008-01-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071205010312/http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/john-norman.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Khulasat-ut-Tawarikh''''' is an Indian [[Persian language]] [[chronicle]] by Sujan Rai (northern [[Indian subcontinent]]). It deals with the history of [[Hindustan]], and also contains details about the contemporary [[Mughal Empire]]. The author completed the work in 1695 CE, during the reign of [[Aurangzeb]]. An insertion about Aurangzeb's death was later added to the original copy by a transcriber.

Alternative transliterations of the book's title include ''Khulasat-Al-Tavarikh'' and ''Khulasatu-t-Tawarikh''.

== Authorship and date ==

The author's name is not given anywhere in the actual book, but the transcribers' notes in several manuscripts mention him as Sujan Rai. Some manuscripts appened Bhandari or Batalvi to his name.&lt;ref name="MA_2011"/&gt; The title [[Munshi]] is also prefixed to his name. One manuscript calls him the "Munshi of Munshis".&lt;ref name="IH_7"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://kblibrary.bih.nic.in/Vol07/BP012.htm |title=Indian History - Vol 7, No. 540 |chapter=Khulasat-ut-Tawarikh |pages=12–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rai was a [[Khatri]] Hindu from [[Batala]]. As a young man, he had served as a ''dabir'' (secretary) to some nobles.&lt;ref name="MA_2011"/&gt; He knew [[Hindustani language|Hindi]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Sanskrit]] languages.&lt;ref name="IH_7"/&gt;

''Khulasat-ut-Tawarikh'' was completed in the 40th year of Aurangzeb's reign, corresponding to 1695 CE. Most of the manuscripts contain a brief account of Aurangzeb's death at the end, written abruptly in a small number of lines. This section is believed to be an insertion in an early copy by a transcriber, and was repeated in the subsequent copies.&lt;ref name="MZH_1918"/&gt;

The descriptions of many provinces, especially those away from the author's native [[Punjab region]], are borrowed from ''Ain-i-Akbari''.&lt;ref name="JS_1901"/&gt; The book gives a detailed and original account of Punjab, especially the [[Lahore]] subah and the [[Batala]] sarkar.&lt;ref name="MZH_1918"/&gt;

=== Hindu kings of India ===

This part gives an account of the pre-Islamic rulers of India, especially [[Delhi]]. It covers kings from the time of the legendary [[Pandava]] ruler [[Yudhishthira]] to Rai Pithora ([[Prithviraj Chauhan]]). The book gives a list of the rulers' names, the period of their reigns and a short account. This section is more of legends than history.&lt;ref name="MZH_1918"/&gt;

=== Muslim kings of India ===

This part gives details of the Muslim rulers, from Nasir-ud-din [[Sabuktigin]] to Aurangzeb. A large portion of this part is borrowed from other works mentioned in the preface. The information unique to ''Khulasat-i-Tawarikh'' includes an account of the contest between Aurangzeb and his brothers.&lt;ref name="MZH_1918"/&gt;

=== Auraganzeb's death ===

Some copies contain an insertion about Aurangzeb's death, inserted by a transcriber. This part mentions that Aurangzeb died in [[Ahmednagar|Ahmadnagar]], Deccan. The date of his death was Friday, the 28th Zulqada of the year 1118 A. H., three hours after dawn. His age at time of his death is given as 91 years 17 days and 2 hours. The period of his reign is stated as 50 years, 2 months and 28 days.&lt;ref name="MZH_1918"/&gt;

== ''Editio princeps'' ==

In 1918, [[Archaeological Survey of India]]'s M. Zafar Hasan made available the first ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the book. He had come across a reference to the book in [[Syed Ahmed Khan]]'s ''Asar-us-Sanadid''. He then started searching for manuscripts of the book, and consolidated them into a printed edition.&lt;ref name="MZH_1918"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/SujanRaiKhulasatAlTavarikh/Sujan%20Rai_Khulasat%20al-Tavarikh#page/n5/mode/2up |title=Khulasatu-t-Tawarikh |editor=M. Zafar Hasan |publisher=VT J. &amp; Sons |year=1918 |pages=i-iii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five manuscripts used by Hasan were:&lt;ref name="MZH_1918"/&gt;

# A party worm-eaten but complete copy. It seems to be comparatively older, since it doesn't contain the description of Aurangzeb's death. It is written in [[Shikasta Nastaʿlīq|Shikasta]] calligraphic style. Its completion is dated to the first year of the reign of Muiz-ud-din Alamgir II. Procured from Delhi.
# Written in [[Nastaliq]] calligraphic style. It is dated to year 1864 of the [[Vikram Samvat]] (1808-09). It was written in the [[Jaipur]] town, during the reign of  Jagat Singh II of [[Jaipur State|Jaipur]], a vassal of the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar II]]. Procured from [[Lucknow]].
# It is written in Nastaliq characters. The year of composition is illegible. Procured from [[Moradabad]].
# It is written in Nastaliq characters. Worm-eaten but complete. There is no date of transcription. Procured from [[Sardhana]].
# An incomplete copy that ends with the deposition of emperor Shah Jahan. First three pages are missing. Written in Shikasta style. Procured from Delhi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4329">A '''knock-for-knock agreement''' is an agreement between two [[insurance]] companies whereby, when both companies' policy-holders incur losses in the same insured event (usually a motor accident), each [[insurer]] pays the losses sustained by its own policy-holder regardless of who was responsible.

==Rationale==
The rationale is economic and administrative efficiency: While an insurer may be able to pursue a recovery from the party responsible for an accident or from its policy-holder, this is a costly administrative procedure. The knock-for-knock agreement simplifies recovery claims among insurers and, over time, attributes costs fairly among insurers.

However, knock-for-knock agreements between insurers have been criticised as unfair on the party ''not'' responsible for an accident. If, for the sake of administrative ease, an insurer pays out to repair damage done to its policy-holder's own car instead of pursuing the party responsible for the accident for all relevant costs, an effective claim is recorded against that policy-holder's insurance record. In this way, knock-for-knock agreements can result in policy-holders finding unexpectedly, when they come to renew their insurance, that they face higher premiums regardless of responsibility for an accident they were involved in.

Regardless of the agreement between the insurers, once the client makes a claim or the insurer pays the client from his/her policy, the insurer has to reinstate the client's No Claim Discount (NCD); hence, the claim won't and should not affect the client's policy, especially if that client was not at fault.{{clarify|date=August 2016}}

==Other contexts==
'''Military Claims'''

'Knock for knock' is also used in a specific, analogous sense, for example, the following, cited in the "[[Laws of war|Law at War]]", from the [[US Army]] website [http://www.army.mil]:

: In addition to handling these routine matters, the chief of the Claims Section participated in the negotiations with the [[Korea]]n government concerning the payment of foreign claims generated by troops of the Army of the Republic of Korea who were active in [[South Vietnam]]. In fact, the MACV Staff judge Advocate's office was to play a vital role in the negotiation and implementation of certain claims agreements with the [[Vietnam]]ese government and the [[Free World]] allies which came to be known as "knock-for-knock" agreements. These compacts contained provisions whereby the government of one nation waived the claims against the government of the second nation for damage to government property. The agreements did not, however, waive the personal right of an individual to claim damages in the case of negligence of a member of the force of another allied nation. The arrangements nevertheless removed a potential irritant to the relationships among the Free World forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/Vietnam/Law-War/law-05.htm LAW AT WAR: VIETNAM 1964-1973, Chapter 5: Claims Administration]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oil and Gas Industry'''

'Knock for knock' is a common contractual arrangement in the oil and gas industry.&lt;ref&gt;2013 Construction Law International, 'Reviewing knock for knock indemnities following the Macondo well blowout'&lt;/ref&gt;  The operator of an oil and gas property requires the assistance and expertise of many kinds of contractors, including drilling companies, well service companies, facility constructors, equipment suppliers, and caterers.  Generally, the operator will engage these services under a 'Master Service Agreement' which sets forth the essential commercial terms under which the work will be performed.  One of these terms is the allocation of the risk of loss to people and property.  In general, a knock-for-knock agreement means that each party working on an oil and gas worksite -- the operator and each contractor -- agrees to protect and indemnify all the other parties against injuries to that party's employees and agents, and destruction or damage to that party's property.  This allocation is not based upon the fault or culpability of the party whose employee was injured or whose property was damaged.  The goal is the efficient defense and payment of a claim through having a single party responsible for the loss.

In [[Shinto]], {{Nihongo||[[wiktionary:別天津神|別天津神]]|'''Kotoamatsukami'''|extra=literally meaning "distinguishing heavenly [[kami|god]]"}} is the collective name for the first gods which came into existence at the time of the [[Japanese creation myth|creation]] of the [[universe]]. They were born in [[Takamagahara]], the world of Heaven at the time of the creation. Unlike the later gods, these deities were born without any procreation. The three deities that first appeared were: 
* [[Amenominakanushi]] (天之御中主神) - Central Master
* [[Takamimusubi]] (高御産巣日神) - High Creator
* [[Kamimusubi]] (神産巣日神) - Divine Creator 
A bit later, two more deities came into existence: 
* [[Umashiashikabihikoji]] (宇摩志阿斯訶備比古遅神) - Energy
* [[Amenotokotachi]] (天之常立神) - Heaven
The next generation of gods that followed was the [[Kamiyonanayo]], which included [[Izanagi|Izanagi-no-Mikoto]] and [[Izanami-no-Mikoto]], the patriarch and matriarch of all other Japanese gods, respectively. Afterward, the Kotoamatsukami "hides away" as ''[[hitorigami]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kojiki]]'', First volume&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Zōkasanshin (three deity of creation) are thought to be genderless, another theory stated Kamimusuhi was the woman and Takamimusubi the man, comparing them with water and fire or with [[yin and yang]].

Some theories also regard Ame-no-Minaka-Nushi as the source of all creation or as the God of the [[Big Dipper]].

Strangely, Takamimusubi later reappeared together with [[Amaterasu]] as one of the central gods in Takamagahara, and his daughter was the mother of the god [[Ninigi-no-Mikoto]]. He also played important roles in the events of the founding of Japan, such as selecting the gods who would tag along with Ninigi and sending the [[Yatagarasu]], the three legged solar crow, to help [[Emperor Jimmu]], who in turn, greatly worshiped him by playing the role of medium priest taking Takami Musubi's identity, in the ceremonies before his [[Enthronement of the Japanese Emperor|Imperial Enthronement]] (Sokui). Later, Takamimusubi was worshiped by the [[Jingi-kan]] and considered the god of matchmaking (based on a pun with his name, "musubi" meaning "to join"). Some Japanese clans also claimed descent from this god, such as the Saeki clan, he is also an Imperial ancestor.

As for Kamimusuhi, he (or she) has strong ties with both the Amatsukami (heavenly gods) and the Kunitsukami (earthly gods) of Izumo mythology. Kamimusuhi is also said to have transformed the grains produced by the food goddess [[Uke Mochi|Ōgetsuhime]] (Ukemochi no kami) after she was slain by Amaterasu's angered brother.

{{Politics of London}}

The '''London Plan''' is the statutory [[spatial planning|spatial development]] strategy for the [[Greater London]] area in the United Kingdom that is written by the [[Mayor of London]] and published by the [[Greater London Authority]].&lt;ref name=london_plan_f08&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/docs/londonplan08.pdf |author=[[Mayor of London]] |publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] |title=The London Plan (Consolidated with Alterations since 2004) |date=February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602000714/http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/docs/londonplan08.pdf |archivedate=2 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The regional planning document was first published in final form on 10 February 2004. In addition to minor alterations, it was substantially revised and republished in February 2008&lt;ref name=turley&gt;{{cite web | author=Sarah Stevens and Ian Fergusson | url=http://www.turleyassociates.co.uk/download.aspx?ID=210 | title=The New Consolidated London Plan | year=2008 | publisher=Turley Associates }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in July 2011.&lt;ref name=london_plan_amend_09&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.london.gov.uk/archive/mayor/publications/2009/docs/london-plan-initial-proposals.pdf | author=[[Mayor of London]] | publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] | title=A new plan for London: Proposals for the Mayor’s London Plan | date=April 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111002011427/http://www.london.gov.uk/archive/mayor/publications/2009/docs/london-plan-initial-proposals.pdf | archivedate=2 October 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=next&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.london.gov.uk/shaping-london/london-plan/what-next/ | title=About the consultation: What happens next? | publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] | author=[[Mayor of London]] | accessdate=12 October 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017033119/http://www.london.gov.uk/shaping-london/london-plan/what-next/ | archivedate=17 October 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, minor alterations were made to the plan to comply with the [[National Planning Policy Framework]] and other changes in national policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/file/14631/download?token=kAiC7WBM |title=REMA |website=London Assembly|date=October 2013|author=Mayor of London |accessdate= 1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current London Plan of March 2016 was published, and amended, in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/current-london-plan |title=The current London Plan |website=London Assembly|date=January 2017|author=Mayor of London |accessdate= 22 April 2017}} [https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/the_london_plan_2016_jan_2017_fix.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; The current plan has a formal end-date of 2036.

==Mandate==
The plan replaced the previous strategic planning guidance for London issued by the Secretary of State and known as [[Regional Planning Guidance|RPG]]3 [http://regulations.completepicture.co.uk/pdf/Planning/Strategic%20guidance%20for%20London%20planning%20authorities.pdf]. It is a requirement of the [[Greater London Authority Act 1999]] that the document is produced and that it deals only with matters that are of strategic importance to Greater London. The Act also requires that the London Plan includes in its scope:

*the health of Londoners,
*[[Equal opportunity|equality of opportunity]],
*contribution to [[sustainable development]] in the United Kingdom.

==Objectives==
The plan is a spatial development strategy for the [[Greater London]] area and has six objectives. The current objectives, as adopted by the 2011 and 2016 revisions, are to ensure that London is:
{{quote|
# a city that meets the challenges of economic and population growth
# an internationally competitive and successful city
# a city of diverse, strong, secure and accessible neighbourhoods
# a city that delights the senses
# a city that becomes a world leader in improving the environment
# a city where it is easy, safe and convenient for everyone to access jobs, opportunities and facilities
|'''London Plan, 2011 and 2016'''
}}
The objectives were previously updated in 2008 following the [[Greater London Authority Act 2007]]:
{{quote|
#To accommodate London's growth within its boundaries without encroaching on open spaces
#To make London a healthier and better city for people to live in
#To make London a more prosperous city with strong and diverse long term economic growth
#To promote social inclusion and tackle deprivation and discrimination
#To improve London's accessibility
#To make London an exemplary world city in mitigating and adapting to climate change and a more attractive, well-designed and green city 
|'''London Plan, 2008'''
}}
The original 2004 objectives were:
{{quote|
#To accommodate London's growth within its boundaries without encroaching on open spaces
#To make London a better city for people to live in
#To make London a more prosperous city with strong and diverse economic growth
#To promote social inclusion and tackle deprivation and discrimination
#To improve London's accessibility
#To make London a more attractive, well-designed and green city
|'''London Plan, 2004'''
}}

==Policies==

===Opportunity areas===
The plan identifies dozens of areas of opportunity, which are where the bulk of efforts will be concentrated, with an aim at reducing social deprivation and creating sustainable development. The opportunity areas will be able to accommodate around 5,000 jobs each or about 2,500 homes, or a mixture of the two. The opportunity areas will mostly be town centres as opposed to suburban developments in the boroughs, although those are mentioned as important in terms of job growth and quality of life. By definition, an Opportunity Area is [[brownfield land]] with significant capacity for development. This contrasts with an Intensification Area that can be developed to higher than existing densities with more modest economic change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are Opportunity Areas?|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/implementing-london-plan/opportunity-areas/what-are-opportunity-areas|website=London Plan|publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sub-regions===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Thames Gateway]] --&gt;
[[File:London Landsat.jpg|thumb|Development must not encroach on green spaces]]
{{further|List of sub-regions used in the London Plan}}
For the purposes of the plan, London is divided into five sub-regions. From 2004 to 2008 the sub-regions were initially the same as the [[Learning and Skills Council]] areas established in 1999.&lt;ref name=review&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] | author=Addison &amp; Associates | title=Review of London's Sub Regional Boundaries | url=http://www.london.gov.uk/archive/mayor/planning/docs/review-srb.pdf | date=June 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604101451/http://www.london.gov.uk/archive/mayor/planning/docs/review-srb.pdf | archivedate=4 June 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this scheme there was a separate Central sub-region and four others around it. The London part of the [[Thames Gateway]] zone was entirely contained within the East London sub-region. The 2004–08 sub-regions each had a ''Sub-Regional Development Framework''.&lt;ref name=srdf&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Mayor of London]] | date=May 2006 | url=http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/planning/srdf/index.jsp | title=Sub Regional Development Frameworks | publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081109085913/http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/planning/srdf/index.jsp | archivedate=9 November 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The sub-regions were revised in February 2008 as part of the ''Further Alterations to the London Plan''. These sub-regions each radiated from the centre to combine inner and outer London boroughs.&lt;ref name=sub&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] | url=http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/caz/ | title=The London Plan: Sub-regions, CAZ and government growth area policies | author=[[Mayor of London]] | date=February 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713081553/http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/caz/ | archivedate=13 July 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008–11 sub-regions, each had its own ''Sub Regional Implementation Framework''.&lt;ref name=draft_further&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] | url=http://www.london.gov.uk/archive/mayor/strategies/sds/further-alts/docs/alts-all.pdf | title=Draft Further Alterations to the London Plan | date=September 2006 | author=[[Mayor of London]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604101100/http://www.london.gov.uk/archive/mayor/strategies/sds/further-alts/docs/alts-all.pdf | archivedate=4 June 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011 the sub-regions were revised again. A smaller Central sub-region was reintroduced, the South sub-region was reintroduced, and all boroughs in the [[Thames Gateway]] were returned to the East sub-region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_migrate_files_destination/LP2011%20Chapter%202.pdf |title=London Plan 2016, Chapter 2 |website=London Assembly|date=March 2016|author=Mayor of London |accessdate= 1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 sub-regions are maintained in the 2016 London Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/current-london-plan/london-plan-chapter-two-londons-places/policy-25 |title=London Plan 2016, Chapter 2 |website=London Assembly|date=March 2016|author=Mayor of London |accessdate= 1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout these revisions has been a separately defined ''Central Activities Zone'' which includes areas with a very high concentration of metropolitan activities.

===Activity centres===
[[File:1 Crossroads Sutton Surrey London.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Sutton, London|Sutton]], a metropolitan centre]]
The London Plan identifies 200 [[activity centre|activity centres]] in the city. All activity centres are categorised into:

*2 '''international centres''', the [[West End of London|West End]] and [[Knightsbridge]]. 
*13 '''metropolitan centres''' such as [[Bromley]], [[Ealing]], [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] and [[Wood Green]]
*34 '''major centres''' such as [[Brixton]], [[Dalston]], [[Eltham]] and [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]]
*151 '''district centres''' such as [[Camberwell]], [[Shepherds Bush]], [[West Hampstead]] and [[Whitechapel]].

Over 1,200 smaller neighbourhood and local centres are also identified in the plan.

==Alterations==
There have been a number of amendments to the London Plan which have been incorporated into the current version that was published in February 2008. Early alterations were made covering housing provision targets, waste and minerals. Further alterations to the plan covered [[climate change]]; London as a [[Global City|world city]]; [[London#Economy|The London Economy]]; Housing; Tackling [[social exclusion]]; [[Transport in London|Transport]]; [[Geography of London|London's geography]], the sub-regions and inter-regions; [[Outer London]]; Liveability (including safety, security and [[Parks and open spaces in London|open spaces]]); and the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]] and [[2012 Summer Paralympics|Paralympic Games]]. The mayor gained new statutory powers following the [[Greater London Authority Act 2007]]. 

Following the [[London mayoral election, 2008|2008 change of mayor]], a new review was initiated in July 2008 and a new London Plan published in July 2011. As of this date, modifications are made to fully comply with the [[National Planning Policy Framework]].

In 2013, London Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] proposed early minor alterations to the London Plan that were aimed at preventing boroughs from setting rent caps or targets for [[Affordable housing|affordable rented]] homes in their local development frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planningresource.co.uk/article/1210300/labour-group-fails-bid-block-london-plan-revisions Labour group fails in bid to block London Plan revisions]. Planning Resource (4 September 2013). Retrieved on 6 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The alterations were approved in a vote by the [[London Assembly]] in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2013/september/mayor-could-face-legal-challenge-to-london-plan-alterations/ Mayor could face legal challenge to London Plan alterations]. Out-law.com. Retrieved on 6 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alterations made since July 2011 were consolidated in the London Plan of March 2016, which was published and amended in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/current-london-plan |title=The current London Plan |website=London Assembly|date=January 2017|author=Mayor of London |accessdate= 22 April 2017}} [https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/the_london_plan_2016_jan_2017_fix.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[London mayoral election, 2016|2016 change of mayor]], London Mayor [[Sadiq Khan]] has outlined proposals towards creating a new London Plan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-outlines-plans-for-a-city-for-all-londoners Mayor outlines plans to create ‘A City for all Londoners’]. london.gov.uk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26590">'''Magic in Anglo-Saxon England''' refers to the belief and practice of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] by the [[Anglo-Saxons]] between the fifth and eleventh centuries AD in [[England in the Middle Ages|Early Mediaeval England]]. In this period, magical practices were used for a variety of reasons, but from the available evidence it appears that they were predominantly used for healing ailments and creating [[amulet]]s, although it is apparent that at times they were also used to curse.

The Anglo-Saxon period was dominated by two separate religious traditions, the polytheistic [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]] and then the monotheistic [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity]], both of which left their influences on the magical practices of the time.

What we know of Anglo-Saxon magic comes primarily from the surviving medical manuscripts, such as ''[[Bald's Leechbook]]'' and the ''[[Lacnunga]]'', all of which date from the Christian era.

Written evidence shows that magical practices were performed by those involved in the medical profession. From burial evidence, various archaeologists have also argued for the existence of professional female magical practitioners that they have referred to as [[cunning folk|cunning women]]. Anglo-Saxons believed in witches, individuals who would perform malevolent magic to harm others.[Citation for this definition?]

In the late 6th century, Christian missionaries began converting Anglo-Saxon England, a process that took several centuries. From the 7th century on, Christian writers condemned the practice of malevolent magic or charms that called on pagan gods as witchcraft in their [[penitential]]s, and laws were enacted in various Christian kingdoms illegalising witchcraft.

==Background==
[[File:Britain peoples circa 600.svg|thumb|right|A map illustrating the various tribal groups in Anglo-Saxon England circa 600 CE.]]

Following the withdrawal of the Roman armies and administrative government from southern Britain in the early 5th century CE, large swathes of southern and eastern England entered what is now referred to as the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]]. During this, the populace appeared to adopt the language, customs and religious beliefs of the various tribes, such as the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]], living in the area that covers modern Denmark and northern Germany. Many archaeologists and historians have believed that this was due to a widespread migration or invasion of such continental European tribes into Britain, although it has also been suggested that it may have been due to [[cultural appropriation]] on behalf of native Britons, who wished to imitate such tribes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car98|Carver 1998]]. pp. 100&amp;ndash;101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Either way, the [[Anglo-Saxon]] populace of England adopted many cultural traits that differed from those in the preceding Iron Age and Romano-British periods. They adopted [[Old English]], a [[Germanic language]] that differed markedly from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and [[Latin]] languages previously spoken, whilst they apparently abandoned [[Christianity]], a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religion devoted to the worship of one God, and instead began following [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]], a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] faith revolving around the veneration of several deities. Differences to people's daily [[material culture]] also became apparent, as those living in England ceased living in roundhouses and instead began constructing rectangular timber homes that were like those found in Denmark and northern Germany. Art forms also changed as jewellery began exhibiting the increasing influence of [[Migration Period Art]] from continental Europe.

===Paganism and Christianity===

Anglo-Saxonist scholar [[Bill Griffiths]] remarked that it was necessary to understand the development of the pantheon of Anglo-Saxon gods in order to understand "the sort of powers that may lie behind magic ritual."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grif03|Griffiths 2003]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the Anglo-Saxon pagan religion was "a mass of unorganised popular belief" with various traditions being passed down orally.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grif03|Griffiths 2003]]. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

The language of the Anglo-Saxons was [[Old English]], a [[Germanic language]] descended from those of several tribes in continental Europe. Old English had several words that refer to ''powerful women associated with divination, magical protection, healing and cursing''.&lt;ref name="Pollington 2000 51"&gt;[[#Pol00|Pollington 2000]]. p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was ''hægtesse'' or ''hægtis'', whilst another was ''burgrune''.&lt;ref name="Pollington 2000 51"/&gt;

Another Old English term for magicians was ''dry'', making them practitioners of ''drycraeft''. Etymologists have speculated that the latter word might have been an anglicised term for the Irish ''drai'', a term referring to [[druid]]s, who appeared as anti-Christian sorcerers in much Irish literature of the period.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut09|Hutton 2009]]. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, it would have been a term borrowed from the [[Celtic languages]], which were widespread across southern Britain prior to the Anglo-Saxon migration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
From the Early Mediaeval to the present day, much information about the Anglo-Saxons and their magical practices have been lost. What we do know comes from a small selection of historical and archaeological sources that have been able to survive.

===Medical manuscripts===
The "main sources of our knowledge of magic" in the Anglo-Saxon period are the surviving medical manuscripts from the period.&lt;ref name="Storms 1948 12"&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these manuscripts come from the 11th century, some being written in Old English and others in Latin, and they are a mix of new compositions and copies of older works.&lt;ref name="Pollington 2000 69"&gt;[[#Pol00|Pollington 2000]]. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Three main manuscripts survive, now known as ''[[Bald's Leechbook]]'', the ''[[Lacnunga]]'' and the ''[[Old English Herbarium]]'', as do several more minor examples.&lt;ref name="Pollington 2000 69"/&gt;

Remarking on the magico-medical knowledge of the Anglo-Saxons, historian [[Stephen Pollington]] noted that the amount "actually recorded was probably only a fraction of the total available to the communities of old, since not everybody had the time and skill to write down what they knew; and furthermore that the few records that survive are only a small part of the corpus: in the thousand years since our surviving manuscripts were written there have been a multitude of cases of accidental or deliberate destruction."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pol00|Pollington 2000]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bald's Leechbook page.jpg|thumb|A facsimile page of ''Bald's Leechbook''.]]

''[[Bald's Leechbook]]'' was written around the middle of the 10th century, and is divided into three separate books.&lt;ref name="Storms 1948 12"/&gt; Written at the [[Winchester]] scriptorium that had been founded by the King of Wessex [[Alfred the Great]] (848/849&amp;ndash;899), it is a copy of an earlier work that may have been written during Alfred's reign.&lt;ref name="Pollington 2000 71"&gt;[[#Pol00|Pollington 2000]]. p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The first two books in the ''Leechbook'' are a collation of Mediterranean and English medical lore, whilst the third is the only surviving example of an early English medical textbook.&lt;ref name="Pollington 2000 71"/&gt; This third book contains remedies listed under which part of the body they are supposed to heal, with plants described under their Old English (rather than Latin) names. This implies it was written before the later Mediterranean influence that came with Christianisation.&lt;ref name="Pollington 2000 71"/&gt; In contrast with the first two parts of the ''Leechbook'', the third contains more magical instructions, with longer and more complicated charms and a greater folkloric component.&lt;ref name="Pollington 2000 71"/&gt;

The second of these sources is the ''[[Lacnunga]]'', a medical manuscript that opens with an Old English translation of the ''Herbarium Apulei'', a description of plants and herbs found throughout classical and mediaeval Europe.&lt;ref name="Storms 1948 16"&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The individual who had originally compiled the Lacnunga started with recipes to heal such ailments as headaches, eye pains and coughs, but whenever "he came across anything that struck his fancy for some reason or other, he immediately put it in without bothering about its form or the order of his book", leaving the work disjointed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. pp. 17&amp;ndash;18.&lt;/ref&gt;
The name "Lacnunga" does not itself appear in the manuscript, but was given to the work by the Reverend Oswald Cockayne who first edited and published it into modern English in the third volume of his ''Leechdoms, Wortcunning and Starcraft of Early England'' (1866).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Godfrid Storms]] compared the ''Leechbook'' and the ''Lacnunga'', arguing that if the former had been "the handbook of the Anglo-Saxon medical man", then the latter was more like "the handbook of the Anglo-Saxon [[medicine-man]]", placing a greater emphasis on magical charms and deviating from normal medical manuscripts in style.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burials===
Archaeologists have identified evidence for magical practices in various burials from Anglo-Saxon England.

==Ritual==
Storms noted that in Anglo-Saxon magical praxes, specific ritual procedures would have had to have been performed in the belief that doing so would enable the magical operation to work.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animism===
Godfrid Storms argued that [[animism]] played a significant role in the worldview of Anglo-Saxon magic, noting that in the recorded charms, "All sorts of phenomenon are ascribed to the visible or invisible intervention of good or evil spirits."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. pp. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary creatures of the spirit world that appear in the Anglo-Saxon charms are the ''ælfar'', or [[elves]], malevolent entities who were believed to cause sickness in humans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. pp. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of spirit creature believed to cause physical harm in the Anglo-Saxon world were dwarves, whom Storms characterised as "disease-spirits".&lt;ref name="Storms 1948 51"&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of charms imply the belief that malevolent "disease-spirits" were causing sickness by inhabiting a person's blood. Such charms offer remedies to remove these spirits, calling for blood to be drawn out to drive the disease-spirit out with it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. pp. 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of Christianity saw some of these pre-Christian mythological creatures reinterpreted as [[devil]]s, who are also referenced in the surviving charms.&lt;ref name="Storms 1948 51"/&gt; For instance, in the ''Leechbook'', it states that:

:Against one possessed by a devil: Put in holy water and in ale bishopwort, water-agrimony, agrimony, alexander, cockle; give him to drink.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lee|Leechbook III]]. LXVII.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charms==

|quote     = "The Anglo-Saxon charms… are of outstanding importance because they provide more than vague references of exceptional and short texts. They cannot be said to reveal everything, for there are numerous points in which they lamentably fail us, but they are numerous enough and, taken as a body, complete enough to give more than a tantalising hint of a strange world. The veil of mystification enveloping magic appears to be thin and transparent here."
|salign    = right
|source    = Godfrid Storms, ''Anglo-Saxon Magic'', 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Storms believed that these charm formulas were "the oldest relics of Anglo-Saxon and Germanic literature", belonging "to the oldest traditions of the Germanic and Indo-European peoples."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolic comparisons===

Many of the Anglo-Saxon charms use symbolic comparisons between a known, described event and the magical act being performed. In this way, the "...two things are in some way brought together, so that what happens to one of them will happen also to the other."&lt;ref name="Storms 1948 54"&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Storms believed that in comparing the two things, the Anglo-Saxon magician hoped to actually make them similar and that their connection may have been based on a "similarity in sound, meaning, form, colour and so on."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in one charm, a curse is placed upon an individual, and their punishment is compared to various other events:

:May you be consumed as coal upon the hearth,&lt;br&gt;may you shrink as dung upon a wall,&lt;br&gt;and may you dry up as water in a pail.&lt;br&gt;May you become as small as a linseed grain,&lt;br&gt;and much smaller than the hipbone of an itchmite,&lt;br&gt;and may you become so small that you become nothing.&lt;ref name="Storms 1948 54"/&gt;

In other examples, comparisons are made between the magical operation being undertaken and Biblical events, for instance one charm states that:

:[[Bethlehem]] is the name of the town where Christ was born.&lt;br&gt;It is well known throughout the world.&lt;br&gt;So may this act [a theft] become known among men.&lt;ref name="Storms 1948 54"/&gt;

==Magic and religion==
In his 1948 study of the subject, entitled ''Anglo-Saxon Magic'', Godfrid Storms noted that the surviving evidence shows "the close connection there was in Anglo-Saxon times between magic and religion."&lt;ref name="Storms 1948 6"&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the Anglo-Saxon period, the religion of the communities living in England changed, from that of [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]], which dominated from the fifth through to the eighth centuries, to [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity]], which was dominant thenceforth.

===Paganism===
[[File:FingleshamMan1965Buckle.png|right|thumb|100px|Anglo-Saxon belt buckle uncovered in [[Finglesham]], which is widely believed to depict the god Woden.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil92|Wilson 1992]]. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Anglo-Saxon paganism was polytheistic, believing in the existence of multiple deities. They also appeared to have revered a number of local deities and spirits in addition to holding nature and specific natural formations in high regard. lack of surviving evidence makes it unclear what Anglo-Saxon people believed the relationship between magic and the gods was like, although from examining the Norse mythological story surrounding the god [[Odin]] and his quest for knowledge, Godfrid Storms argued that across the Germanic-speaking world, there was a belief that the gods were "as much subject to magic as more earthly creatures."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The god [[Woden]] is the only pre-Christian deity to be mentioned in the surviving Anglo-Saxon charms.&lt;ref name="Storms 1948 6"/&gt; The charm in question is known as the ''[[Nine Herbs Charm]]'', and involves a discussion of nine different herbs used medicinally.&lt;ref name="Storms 1948 55"/&gt; In the charm, it is proclaimed that:

:A worm came crawling, it killed nothing.&lt;br&gt;For Woden took nine glory twigs,&lt;br&gt;he smote then the adder that it flew apart into nine parts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lac|Lacnunga II]]. 41-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Storms noted that in this charm, Woden's victory in smiting the adder is evoked to symbolise how the poison in the human body is smitten by the recitation of the charm.&lt;ref name="Storms 1948 55"&gt;[[#Sto48|Storms 1948]]. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal charms also featured prominently in Anglo-Saxon magic as wards against evil magic users. These charms contained clear zoomorphic symbolism borrowed from Pagan beliefs such as symbols of the Boar, Eagle and Wolf. Furthermore, these charms were often designed for

===Christianity===
Many of the beliefs in charms, the supernatural and the magical world survived Christianization and were incorporated in Popular Religion and a "Cultural Paganism" that was not always seen as being at odds with Christian beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Owen-Crocker, Gale R. 1981. Rites and Religions of the Anglo-Saxons. Newton Abbot, Devon : Totowa, N.J.: David &amp; Charles, Pg. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Charms were continued to be used and often contained zoomorphic symbolism such as the Wolf, Raven or Boar, obviously influenced by sacral worship of these creatures from Anglo-Saxon Paganism.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlgren, Thomas H. "The Pagan Iconography of Christian Ideas: Tree-lore in Anglo-Viking England." Mediaevistik 1 (1988): Pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; These charms were often used to guard against elves and other supernatural creatures which were believed to have a malicious intent towards humans and which had access to hostile magic.&lt;ref&gt;Bonser, Wilfrid. "Magical Practices against Elves." Folklore 37, no. 4 (1926): Pg. 352&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magical practitioners==
There were various different kinds of magician in the Anglo-Saxon world.

===Leeches===
Evidence from the medical manuscripts informs us that among those who performed magic were members of the Anglo-Saxon medical profession, now known as leeches. In the context of Anglo-Saxon medics, the term "leech" was unconnected to the [[leech|bloodsucking worms]], instead deriving from the Old English ''læce'', a term that in Early Mediaeval England referred to healers of any kind.&lt;ref name="Pollington 2000 41"&gt;[[#Pol00|Pollington 2000]]. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Being a commonly used word in Old English, ''læce'' was the basis to several place names in England, such as [[Lesbury]] (''læce-burg'', or leech-fort) and [[Lexham]] (''læce-ham'', or leech-settlement).&lt;ref name="Pollington 2000 41"/&gt;

The written record only ever refers to male leeches, with no mention made of any females operating in the profession.&lt;ref name="Pollington 2000 45"&gt;[[#Pol00|Pollington 2000]]. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollington noted that this does not necessarily imply that there never were any female leeches, but could "reflect the bias of the records towards the official, fee-charging, professional physician over the local village healer or unofficial midwife."&lt;ref name="Pollington 2000 45"/&gt;

===Cunning folk===
Various archaeologists, primarily Audrey Meaney and Tania Dickinson, have argued that there were [[Cunning folk in Britain|cunning women]], or female magical practitioners, during the Anglo-Saxon period.

Stephen Pollington, an expert in Anglo-Saxon England, however commented that "the evidence for 'healing' or 'cunning' men and women in Anglo-Saxon England is sparse, and what little there is remains difficult to interpret."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pol00|Pollington 2000]]. p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Witchcraft==
{{Main|Witchcraft in Anglo-Saxon England}}

===Evidence from penitentials===
Evidence for the practice of [[witchcraft]], or malevolent magic, can be found in the written records dating from the latter centuries of Anglo-Saxon England. The earliest of these are Latin [[penitential]]s written as handbooks for Christian priests, explaining to them the type of penance required for each sin, including the sin of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mea89|Meaney 1989]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest of these was the ''[[Paenitentiale Theodori]]'', attributed to [[Theodore of Tarsus]], who held the position of [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] from 667 to 690. In chapter I. XV, ''De Cultura Idolorum'' ('Concerning the worship of idols'), it states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|
:&lt;small&gt;Theodore's original Latin:&lt;/small&gt;
:''Si mulier incantationes vel divinationes diabolicas fecerit, I annum... peniteat. De hoc in canone dicitur: Qui auguria, auspicia sive somnia vel divinationes quaslibet secundum mores gentilium observant, aus in domus suas hujusmodi homines introducunt in exquirendis aliquam artem maleficiorum, penitentes isti, si de clero sunt, abiacantus; si vero seculares, quinquennio peniteant.''
|
:&lt;small&gt;Modern English translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:"If a woman has performed incantations or diabolical divinations, let her do penance for one year. About which it says in the canon: Those who observe auguries or auspices or dreams or any kind of divinations according to the customs of the heathens, or introduce men of this kind into their homes in investigating a device of the magicians &amp;ndash; if these repent, if they are of the clergy let them be cast out, but if they are truly secular people let them do penance for five years."&lt;ref name="Meaney 20, 36"&gt;[[#Mea89|Meaney 1989]]. pp. 20, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Commenting on this section of the ''Paenitentiale Theodori'', the archaeologist Audrey Meaney noted that it closely resembled [[Pseudo-Isidore|Isidore Mercator]]'s Latin version of Canon 23 of the [[Synod of Ancyra|Council of Ankara]]. She noted however that in this penitential, the sentence for witchcraft is far lighter that than prescribed at Ankara, and it refers specifically to women as witches.&lt;ref name="Meaney 20"&gt;[[#Mea89|Meaney 1989]]. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This section of the ''Paenitentiale Theodori'' was quoted in the ''[[Paenitentiale Ecgberhti]]'', which is attributed to the first [[Archbishop of York]], [[Ecgbert (bishop)|Ecgbert]], and also in the English ''[[Scriftboc]]''.&lt;ref name="Meaney 20, 36"/&gt; In the latter, it remarks that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|
:&lt;small&gt;Original Old English:&lt;/small&gt;
:''Gyf wif drycræft and galdorcræft and unlibban wyrce and swylc bega, fæste XII monað [on hlafe and on wætere].''
|
:&lt;small&gt;Modern English translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:"If a woman acts with wizardry, enchantment and drugs, and succeeds, let her fast 12 months [on bread and water]."&lt;ref name="Meaney 20, 36"/&gt;
|
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Evidence from law codes===
{{Quote box|width     = 30em|border    = 1px|align     = right|bgcolor   = #ACE1AF|fontsize  = 85%
|title_bg  = |title_fnt = |title     = |quote     = "[In the Anglo-Saxon witch] we have woman in her basic feminine roles as wife and lover, housekeeper and mother, and as guardian of her family’s health. In each of these aspects it is understandable that from time to time she would find inadequate the socially acceptable ways of manipulating her environment, and resort to other means, whether these were calling on the old gods whom the churchmen considered demons; using a ritual tainted by heathenism (whether pagan English, or mediterranean); or concocting a magic &amp;ndash; and let it be admitted &amp;ndash; probably dangerously toxic brew as an aphrodisiac or abortifacient. Only occasionally do we get a hint of a woman stepping outside her normal role, to call up the dead or foretell the future, or magically piercing a man with [[lumbago]]."|salign    = right|source    = Archaeologist Audrey Meaney on the image of the witch in Anglo-Saxon England, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mea89|Meaney 1989]]. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In the introduction to ''Alfred's Laws'', containing a translation of biblical judgments, it includes an alteration on the law "Do not allow sorcerers to live" from the [[Book of Exodus]]. This alteration proclaims "Do not allow the women who are accustomed to receive enchanters, magicians and witches to live." Audrey Meaney speculated that it might have been influenced by the anti-witchcraft passages in the ''Paenitentiale Theodori''.&lt;ref name="Meaney 20"/&gt;

===Societal role of the witch===

In the surviving records, the Anglo-Saxon witch was usually portrayed as a young woman, who practiced magic to find a lover, win the love of her husbands, give birth to a live baby or to protect her children. This is in contrast to the later English stereotype of a witch, which is that of an elderly spinster or widow.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mea89|Meaney 1989]]. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; All the records of Anglo-Saxon witchcraft were produced by men, potentially explaining why it was usually women who were accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mea89|Meaney 1989]]. pp. 29&amp;ndash;30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Manananggal''' (sometimes confused with the [[Wak Wak]] and [[Aswang]], also translates literally to "Remover") is a [[vampire]]-like mythical creature of the Philippines, a malevolent, [[Man-eater|man-eating]] and [[hematophagy|blood-sucking]] [[monster]] or [[Witchcraft|witch]].

==Mythology==
The manananggal is described as scary, often hideous, usually depicted as female, and always capable of severing its upper torso and sprouting huge bat-like wings to fly into the night in search of its victims. The word ''manananggal'' comes from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word ''tanggal'', which means "to remove" or "to separate", which literally translates as "remover" or "separator".  In this case, "one who separates itself".  The name also originates from an expression used for a severed torso.

The manananggal is said to favor preying on sleeping, pregnant women, using an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck the hearts of [[fetus]]es, or the blood of someone who is sleeping. The severed lower torso is left standing, and is the more vulnerable of the two halves. Sprinkling salt, smearing crushed garlic or ash on top of the standing torso is fatal to the creature. The upper torso then would not be able to rejoin itself and would perish by sunrise.&lt;ref name=m001/&gt;&lt;ref name=m002/&gt;&lt;ref name=m003/&gt;

The myth of the Manananggal is popular in the [[Visayas|Visayan regions]] of the [[Philippines]], especially in the western provinces of [[Capiz]], [[Iloilo]] and [[Antique (province)|Antique]]. There are varying accounts of the features of a manananggal. Like vampires, [[Visayan people|Visayan]] folklore creatures, and [[aswang]]s, manananggals are also said to abhor garlic and salt.&lt;ref name="balete"&gt;{{cite book |last=Paraiso |first=Salvador |authorlink= |author2=Jose Juan Paraiso |title=The Balete Book: A Collection of Demons, Monsters and Dwarfs from the Philippine Lower Mythology |year=2003 |publisher=Giraffe Books |location=Philippines |isbn=978-971-8832-79-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also known to avoid daggers, light, vinegar, spices and the tail of a stingray, which can be [[Buntot Pagi|fashioned as a whip]].&lt;ref name=m002/&gt; Folklore of similar creatures can be found in the neighbouring nations of [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]]. The province of [[Capiz]] is the subject or focus of many manananggal stories, as with the stories of other types of mythical creatures, such as [[ghost]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[ghoul]]s generically referred to as [[aswang]]s. Sightings are purported here, and certain local folk are said to believe in their existence despite modernization. The manananggal shares some features with the [[vampire]] of [[Balkan]] folklore, such as its dislike of [[garlic]], [[salt]], and vulnerability to sunlight.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2969">'''Mary Ann Vaughn''' (born April 17, 1949), a.k.a. Marianne Wilson, is a citizen of [[Sweden]] who  was the subject of a widely publicised and highly controversial case in international family law decided in the [[Tokyo High Court]] in 1956, [[Sweden v. Yamaguchi]].  Vaughn became the ward of the Swedish Ambassador to Japan, [[Tage Grönfall]] and later [[Frederick Almquist]], and resided in the [[Embassy|Swedish Embassy]] in Tokyo.

== Birth and ancestry ==

Vaughn was born the only child of [[James A. Vaughn]] (May 7, 1925- February 3, 2003) and [[Vivienne Joy Wilson]] (November 2, 1929 – August 5, 1950), in [[Bluff Hospital]] in Yokohama, Japan, on April 17, 1949. Her father was a US national employed under contract with the United States Military Administration of Occupied Japan. Her mother was a Swedish national, of three generations of Swedish citizens resident in Japan. She was descended from [[John Wilson (Captain)|John Wilson]] and [[Sophia Wilson]], former Naka Yamazaki, her grandparents, and Professor John Wilson.

Vivienne Wilson had been weakened by the privations of World War II, and contracted tuberculosis during James Vaughn's absence to the United States, during which Mary Ann was cared for by a nanny, Fumi. Vivienne died on 5 August 1950, the very day of passage of private legislation permitting her to immigrate to the United States.  She was buried in the [[Gaijin bochi|Geijin Boche]], the [[Foreign cemeteries in Japan|Foreign Cemetery]] overlooking the port in [[Yokohama]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moritsugu |first=Ken |date=November 25, 2016 |title=Japanese woman reclaims dad, US identity in 6-decade journey |url=https://www.apnews.com/8700232293d14009b90d600d425ff1c3/Japanese-woman-reclaims-dad,-US-identity-in-6-decade-journey |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

After the death of her mother, Vaughn was placed under the guardianship of Professor John Wilson, with nanny Fumi Kaneko (later Fumi Yamaguchi) in custodial care. Due to the privations of the postwar period, John Wilson sailed to Sweden with his wife and children in 1952. Vaughn was to accompany them, but due to an outbreak of whooping cough, she was to sail on the next ship. However, Yamaguchi absconded with Vaughn, and Yamaguchi destroyed the child's records, raising her under claim of an abandoned American orphan in the slums of Yokohama.

== Media ==
The story of Mary Ann Vaughn has been extensively covered by the popular press, and is of considerable interest to organizations such as the Japan Children's Rights Network ( [http://crnjapan.net/The_Japan_Childrens_Rights_Network/res-sucstore.html ''Non-Japanese Awarded Custody of a Child in Japan'']).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crnjapan.net The Japan Children's Rights Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pond5''' is a New York-based [[online marketplace]] for [[royalty-free]] media. The company licenses [[stock footage]], [[Production music|stock music]], [[stock photography]] sound effects, after effects, images and 3-D models. Pond5 is reported to have the world's largest collection of stock footage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videomaker.com/videonews/2015/07/pond5-breaks-industry-record-with-library-exceeding-4-million-video-clips/|title=Pond5 Breaks Industry Record With Library Exceeding 4 Million Video Clips|publisher=VideoMaker|author=Marshal Rosenthal|date=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosting more than 10.5 million clips as of early 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pond5.com/press|title=Pond5 Press|publisher=Pond5|author=Pond5|date=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company originally focused on selling [[video clips]], but began to expand into other asset types following its 2013 acquisition of Pixmac, a stock photography site based in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="pando"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tc2"/&gt;  The acquisition added Pixmac’s 6,000+ photographers and support for 17 languages to the Pond5 marketplace &lt;ref name="tnw1"/&gt;

==History==
Pond5 was founded in 2006 as a way for video producers to license content to third parties.&lt;ref name="tc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/31/pond5-redesign/|title=Media Licensing Marketplace Pond5 Launches Massive Redesign, With Advanced Search And Customized Artist Pages|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently expanded into other media types, including photos, music, sound effects, 3D models, and [[Adobe After Effects]] templates.&lt;ref name="pando"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pandodaily.com/2013/03/05/media-marketplace-pond5-acquires-european-stock-photo-startup-pixmac/|title=Media marketplace Pond5 acquires European stock photo startup Pixmac|work=PandoDaily|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tc2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/05/pond5-acquires-pixmac/|title=Media Marketplace Pond5 Acquires Stock Photo Startup Pixmac To Expand Its International Presence|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pond5 does not own the content on its site, but instead aggregates and sells content created and owned by its contributors. These contributors determine the selling price, and earn 50% of revenue.&lt;ref name="pando"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tc2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tnw1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/03/05/stock-media-marketplace-pond5-acquires-rival-pixmac/|title=Stock Media Marketplace Pond5 Acquires Rival Pixmac|author=Martin Bryant|date=5 March 2013|work=The Next Web|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tc1" /&gt;

In July 2014, venture capital firms [[Accel Partners]] and [[Stripes Group]] invested $61 million in series A financing into Pond5.&lt;ref name="fortune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2014/07/16/pond5-accel-stripes-stock-video-61-million-funding-round/|title=Pond5, a stock video company, raises $61 million from Accel, Stripes - Fortune|work=Fortune|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/07/16/shutterstock-and-getty-images-competitor-pond5-raises-61-million/|title=Shutterstock and Getty Images Competitor Pond5 Raises $61 Million|publisher=Blogs.wsj.com|accessdate=9 December 2014}}/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products and Partnerships==

In January 2014, Pond5 partnered with [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] to create a plugin for [[Adobe Premiere Pro]] integrating the Pond5 video collection with the editing suite.&lt;ref name="tnw2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/01/21/pond5-adobe-partner-adobe-premiere-pro-royalty-free-video-music-sound-effects-plugin/|title=Pond5 and Adobe partner for Adobe Premiere Pro royalty-free video, music and sound effects plugin|author=Ben Woods|date=21 January 2014|work=The Next Web|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2015, the company launched the [[Public Domain]] Project, a free online repository of nearly 100,000 digitalized media assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/20/pond5-issues-80000-free-media-assets-with-the-launch-of-its-public-domain-project/|title=Pond5 Issues 80,000 Free Media Assets With The Launch Of Its Public Domain Project|author=Jonathan Shieber|date=20 January 2015|work=Techcrunch|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original business model focused on licensing individual video clip sales. However, in February 2016, the company unveiled a subscription product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psfk.com/2016/02/ai-technology-for-best-stock-media-footage-pond5.html|title=Might an AI visual search engine revitalize the industry as a whole?|author=Ido Lechner|date=26 February 2016|work=PFSK|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late December 2016, the company roled out Extended licenses aimed at attracting large enterprise customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=206597|title=Pond5 Introduces Extended Licenses, Offering Some of the Highest Levels of Coverage, Protection, and Flexibility in the Industry|date=2 December 2016|work=Press Release|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Ray Stevens''' (September 5, 1935 – May 3, 1996), better known as '''Ray "The Crippler" Stevens''' or '''Ray "Blond Bomber" Stevens''', was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]].

Stevens was a wrestling superstar since the early years of the television era until he retired during the early 1990s. His performances and hard [[Bump (professional wrestling)|bumping]] style inspired generations of [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] wrestlers who have attempted to emulate his ability to provide high quality and heat generating matches that continuously bring in huge crowds of fans. He was well known for using two different finishing moves in his many victories: the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving knee drop|"Bombs Away" knee drop]] (a diving knee drop from the top rope to the throat) and the [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]]. Stevens wrestled as both a singles performer and in tag team matches with a variety of partners.

In 2006, he was inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]].

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career===
Stevens began his four decade-long career in 1950 at the age of 15. One of Stevens's mentors was the [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|"Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers]], a former [[NWA World Heavyweight Champion]]. When commenting on the ability of his longtime friend, Rogers consistently said "Ray was one of the most talented and graceful wrestlers I've ever watched and been a part of. He won titles at the youngest age of any wrestler I've ever known and was a credit to the game" (Page 3 of Whatever Happened To...?, Issue Number Twenty One, May 1996).

Throughout most of his working years, Stevens was a villain. He occasionally turned into a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]]. His most famous finishing move was the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|"Bombs Away" knee drop]] which involved Ray "the Blond Bomber" jumping off the top turnbuckle and landing with his knee on the throat of his opponent. Stevens's initial foray into main event wrestling involved his matches with one of the 1950s most colorful heels, [[Gorgeous George]]. It was a result of his work with George, that Stevens became a main event star. At this stage of his career, Ray Stevens was 17 years old.

Stevens further developed his skills in [[tag team]] matches. He initially went into a partnership with [[Don Fargo]] as Ray and Don Stevens. In addition, on August 6, 1959, Stevens teamed up with "Professor" [[Roy Shire]] as "brother" Ray Shire to win the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] from [[Dick the Bruiser]] and [[Angelo Poffo]]. The Shire Brothers were involved in many famous [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angles]] until Roy moved on to become promoter of [[Big Time Wrestling (San Francisco)|Big Time Wrestling]] wrestling programs in San Francisco's [[Cow Palace]]. One angle, which took place in Indianapolis on October 1, 1960, involved a "match" between boxer [[Archie Moore]], a former World Light Heavyweight Boxing Champion, and the Shire Brothers.  This match did not show Ray and Roy having any significant advantage over Moore. For one thing, the Shire Brothers were required to wear boxing gloves and follow the rules of boxing when they went against professional boxer Moore. Both Ray and Roy were "knocked out" in a matter of minutes. This match did not settle the argument as to who is the superior athlete, the professional boxer or the professional wrestler. A positive outcome of this "match" was the fans, who attended this event in large numbers, having the pleasure of seeing the long-awaited comeuppance of the arrogant and rule-breaking Shire Brothers.

By the end of the 1950s, Ray Stevens was ready to move on to the next stage of his wrestling career, which took place in the city of [[San Francisco]] and throughout [[Northern California]].

===Big Time Wrestling: the San Francisco years===
Stevens, reverting to his real name, started out in San Francisco, [[California]] for [[Big Time Wrestling (San Francisco)|Big Time Wrestling]] on March 4, 1961, where he was involved in an angle with [[Pepper Gomez]] and captured the [[NWA San Francisco United States Championship|NWA United States Championship]] nine times and the [[NWA San Francisco Tag Team Championship|NWA World Tag Team Championship]] three times.  During his first televised interview on the Bay Area's ''[[KTVU]] Channel Two'' weekly Friday night wrestling show promoting his upcoming match at the Cow Palace, Stevens, speaking with a low pitched growl from the side of his mouth in the manner of a movie tough, shocked the fans when he said San Francisco was a terrible place to live. He also referred to those who watched the wrestling programs as "hillbillies" and "pencil neck geeks."  The insults thrown at the inhabitants of San Francisco caused a bit of a stir at the time which helped to further enhance Stevens' box office draw.

One noteworthy characteristic of Ray Stevens was his flexible use of different cities being referred to as his birthplace. His actual birthplace was [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia]]. He was, shortly afterward, raised in [[Columbus, Ohio]] by his aunt during the years of the [[Great Depression]]. Whenever he was introduced by a wrestling program announcer in San Francisco, his birthplace was [[New York City]]. After moving to the East Coast during the early 70s, his birthplace became San Francisco. This was done to plant the idea in the minds of the fans that he was an outsider instead of one of them.

The matches between Pepper Gomez and Ray Stevens, during the early part of the 1960s, certainly set the tenor for the Blond Bomber's dominance as top heel in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] during the entire decade. Gomez, at the time, had the reputation of having a "cast iron" stomach. He constantly challenged other wrestlers to jump on his stomach and try to get him to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Sell|sell]]. Until the Blond Bomber came along, in May 1962, to pick up on this challenge, no wrestler was able succeed in causing more than just a little discomfort from jumping on his stomach. Gomez accepted a challenge from Ray Stevens to jump on his stomach off from a fifteen feet ladder which was placed in the center of the ring. Stevens did so from the halfway point on the ladder, but he did not succeed in getting Gomez to sell. Drawing from his seemingly inexhaustible arsenal of nefarious tactics, Stevens then went to the top of the ladder and, instead of jumping off feet first, he quickly switched to using his Bombs Away knee drop. The impact caused Gomez to spit blood and put him out of action for several weeks. After Gomez recovered from his "injury", he and Stevens had a bout at the Cow Palace which was attended by approximately 17,000 fans with many more turned away due to lack of space. This was the largest paying crowd to have attended any events at the Cow Palace, including a musical extravaganza which starred [[Elvis Presley]].

During 1962, the KTVU television station, in conjunction with its Friday night wrestling program, conducted a major survey which incorporated the opinions of wrestling fans in the Bay Area. The purpose of the survey was to determine which pro wrestler was considered to be the most popular and which one was the most hated. Unsurprisingly, Ray Stevens was selected as the most hated wrestler. However, many wrestling insiders were stunned to find that Stevens was also voted in as the most popular. This vote clearly shown the impact that Stevens had on the wrestling scene in San Francisco and its growing popularity among the fans.

Another match, which took place in 1963, between Gomez and Stevens led to an unexpected ending. After a heated exchange of blows, Gomez grabbed the rather hefty time keeper's bell and spun around to take aim at Stevens’s head. Gomez apparently misjudged the weight of the bell when hitting the Blond Bomber. Stevens quickly fell to the mat and laid prone. It took a short while before it was noticed that Stevens was seriously hurt. He was taken to the hospital unconscious. Fortunately, he did not incur brain damage and eventually recovered the next day. The [[San Francisco Examiner]]'s columnist Jack Rosenbaum, headlining his story about the incident as "A Touch of Realism at the Cow Palace", compared Stevens to a fallen Greek warrior from ancient times. Gomez was fined $5,000 (which was a large sum of money during those times) by the [[California State Athletic Commission]] for his part in this mishap. Since then, Stevens and Gomez had many bouts which were always well attended by the fans.

During his San Francisco years, Stevens took on and vanquished wrestlers of such caliber as Cowboy Bob Ellis, [[Karl Gotch]], [[Pat O'Connor (wrestler)|Pat O'Connor]], [[Pepper Gomez]], [[Kinji Shibuya]], [[Bobo Brazil]], [[Bruno Sammartino]] (through a count out), [[Pedro Morales]], [[Bill Miller (wrestler)|Dr. Big Bill Miller]], [[Ernie Ladd|Ernie "Big Cat" Ladd]], [[Jose Lothario]], and many others. More than any other move, the Bombs Away knee drop was the deciding factor in his victories.

In 1965, Stevens teamed up with [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship. They were known as the "[[Blond Bombers]]." Stevens and Patterson had two runs holding the NWA World Tag Team title and one run with the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]]. In 1969, after making a babyface turn, Stevens went against Patterson in a number of mat wars.

On July 15, 1967, Bruno Sammartino, [[WWE Championship|WWWF World Heavyweight Champion]], wrestled a [[Professional wrestling match types#Series variations|two out of three falls match]] for the title against the Blond Bomber in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="WWFresults71"&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989|last=Cawthon|first=Graham|pages=71|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevens pinned Sammartino with the "Bombs Away" to win the first fall; Sammartino forced Stevens to submit to win the second fall; Stevens won the third and deciding fall via countout.&lt;ref name="WWFresults71"/&gt; It was later determined that according to WWWF rules, a champion could not lose the title due to a countout. Thus, Bruno Sammartino was able to return to the East Coast with his title still intact and the title change was never officially recognized.&lt;ref name="WWFresults71"/&gt;

Stevens was known for using risky acrobatic moves in his matches.  An example of a crowd pleasing stunt, created by the Blond Bomber in 1965, was the Turnbuckle Flip. After being arm thrown into the far corner, Stevens would go into a half somersault landing with his back on the top turnbuckle and then do a [[blading (professional wrestling)|blade job]] on his forehead before falling to the cement floor. This bumping technique was replicated by a few wrestlers like [[Ric Flair]] as part of their in-ring repertoire.

Over the years, Ray Stevens has been viewed by many wrestling insiders as the best [[worker]] during the 1960s. Stevens had the ability to make any opponent look good, no matter how badly they may perform in the ring. In addition, he was able to demonstrably convince the fans, through his ring work and his equally great interview work, that he could methodically and completely destroy anyone regardless of how strong or how big they may be.

===American Wrestling Association and National Wrestling Alliance===
He then moved on to the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) in 1971, where he enjoyed success as a four-time [[AWA World Tag Team Championship|AWA World Tag Team champion]] (three with [[Nick Bockwinkel]], one with Pat Patterson). After that, he captured three [[List of NWA World Tag Team Champions|NWA World Tag Team titles]] in [[Jim Crockett Promotions]]. It was on January 20, 1972 when Stevens and Nick Bockwinkel first captured the AWA World Tag Team Championship from [[The Crusher (wrestler)|Crusher Lisowski]] and [[Red Bastien]] in [[Denver, Colorado]]. The team was managed by [[Bobby Heenan]] beginning in 1974.

While working with the AWA in 1972, Stevens had a television match with a masked wrestler known as [[Dick Beyer|Doctor X]] (Dick Beyer) in which he applied the Bombs Away [[coup de grâce]] to win the match while Doctor X's leg was tangled between two ring ropes. This resulted in the "breaking" of Doctor X's leg (which allowed Beyer to leave the area to work with a wrestling tour in Japan as [[Dick Beyer|"The Destroyer"]]) and also led to the outlawing of the Bombs Away maneuver by the AWA. It was shortly after that match when Ray Stevens was no longer called the Blond Bomber and became known as "The Crippler."

In 1976, Stevens and Bockwinkel were still the team to beat, but friction was growing within the team. An angle developed where Heenan and Bockwinkel did the talking during their promos and cut Stevens off whenever he tried to speak. When Bobby Heenan was named the 1976 Manager of The Year by a pro wrestling magazine on a Christmas Day episode of ''AWA All-Star Wrestling'', Bockwinkel attacked Stevens. This happened because the Crippler pushed Heenan, while Bockwinkel was trying to congratulate Bobby on being manager of the year; however, Stevens was able to get the upper hand and eventually destroyed a trophy presented to Heenan for his being named "Manager of the Year." This led to the eventual break up of the team and a feud between the two to start the year 1977.

===World Wrestling Federation===
From there, he moved to the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF). In the WWF, he was managed by "Classy" Freddie Blassie. Stevens and Captain Lou Albano turned on [[Jimmy Snuka|Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka]] (Albano was Snuka's manager) in 1982. This angle had the Crippler piledriving Snuka onto the concrete floor (before padding was introduced) two consecutive times. At this stage of his career, the mounting physical abuse after years on the road, with multiple injuries, difficulty in maintaining optimum conditioning, and his advancing age, along with promoters beginning to favor the use of more muscular physiques, had clearly began to take its toll.

Stevens also briefly did color commentary alongside [[Vince McMahon]] in 1984.

===Late career===
After leaving the WWF, Stevens returned to the AWA,&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; where he joined forces with [[Larry Zbyszko]] in feuding with the babyface-turned Bockwinkel, only to turn face himself after Zbyszko turned on him. Stevens was doing color commentary for [[ESPN]]'s ''AWA Championship Wrestling'' during the AWA World Heavyweight title match between champion Bockwinkel and [[Curt Hennig]] in San Francisco on May 2, 1987 when interference by Zbyszko (who handed a roll of coins to Hennig from ringside to use against Bockwinkel) led to Hennig winning the title from Bockwinkel. Stevens and Bockwinkel protested the outcome of the match to the AWA Championship Committee, which held up the championship immediately after the match, but the original match decision was upheld days later after the committee ruled that there was no evidence that Zbyszko had illegally aided Hennig. As a result, the championship was returned to the now heel-turned Hennig. Stemming from the events of that match, Stevens feuded briefly with Zbyszko before finishing out his career in 1992, after 42 years.

On May 20, 2006, Ray "The Crippler" Stevens was posthumously honored by being inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] at Amsterdam, New York. He was the first professional wrestler to be selected for induction into two separate categories: [[Tag team]] (with Pat Patterson) and Modern Era (for his superlative work as a singles wrestler).

==Personal life==
In 1952, Stevens was married to female wrestler Theresa Theis, who also did some work as Stevens' trainer and helped to hone his skills as a professional wrestler during the initial stage of his career. They were divorced in 1972.

He appeared in the 1974 movie ''[[The Wrestler (1974 film)|The Wrestler]]'' and the 1978 [[Sylvester Stallone]] movie ''[[Paradise Alley]]''.

In 1995, the mayors of San Francisco and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] jointly proclaimed April 5 "Ray Stevens Day".&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

On May 3, 1996, Stevens died from a heart attack in his sleep at his home in [[Fremont, California]]. He was survived by five children: Carl, Timothy and Laura from Fremont, Roy from [[Sacramento, California]], and Kelly from [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].

With the growth of [[science fiction studies]] as an academic discipline as well as a popular media genre, a number of libraries, museums, archives, and special collections have been established to collect and organize works of scholarly and historical value in the field.

==Key collections==

The Merril Collection of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Speculation is a leading collection of [[science fiction]]. It was founded in [[Toronto]] in 1970 by [[Judith Merril]]. This [[Toronto Public Library|public library]] collection contains over 63,000 items, including books, magazines, audiovisual works, original manuscripts, and other items of interest to both casual users and academic researchers.&lt;ref name="merril"&gt;{{cite web

[[Paul Allen]] and Jody Patton founded the [[Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame]] in 2004, located at the base of [[Space Needle]] in [[Seattle]]. Prominent authors such as [[Greg Bear]] serve as advisers to the museum.

An important museum of the genre is [[Maison d'Ailleurs|Maison d’Ailleurs]] ("House of Elsewhere") in [[Yverdon-les-Bains]], [[Switzerland]], housing a large collection of literature relating to science fiction, [[utopia]]s, and extraordinary journeys. It was founded by the French encyclopedist [[Pierre Versins]] in 1976 and now owns over 70,000 books, as well as many other items (60,000) related to science fiction and its imagery.

The term '''serials crisis''' has become a common shorthand to describe the chronic [[Subscription business model|subscription]] cost increases of many [[serials (publishing)|serial publications]] such as [[Academic journal|scholarly journals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.unc.edu/scholcomdig/whitepapers/panitch-michalak.html | first1 = Judith M | last1 = Panitch | first2 = Sarah | last2 = Michalak | contribution = The Serials Crisis | type = white paper | publisher = UNC-Chapel | title = Hill Scholarly Communications Convocation | date = January 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The prices of these institutional or library subscriptions have been rising much faster than the [[Consumer Price Index]] for several decades,&lt;ref name="ala.org"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ala.org/alcts/sites/ala.org.alcts/files/content/resources/collect/serials/ppi/05usppi.pdf | last = Dingley | first = Brenda | place = US | title = U.S. Periodical Prices | year = 2005 | format = [[PDF]] | publisher = ALA}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while the funds available to the libraries have remained static or have declined in real terms. As a result, academic and research libraries have regularly canceled serial subscriptions to accommodate price increases of the remaining current subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/dis/lisu/downloads/op37.pdf | last1 = White | first1 = Sonya | first2 = Claire | last2 = Creaser | title = Trends in Scholarly Journal Prices 2000–2006 | publisher = lboro | place = UK | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Harvard University says it can't afford journal publishers' prices |first=Ian |last=Sample |journal=The Guardian |date=24 April 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rising subscription prices==
The subscription prices of scholarly journals have been increasing at a rate faster than the [[inflation rate]] for several decades.&lt;ref name="ala.org"/&gt; This [[chronic inflation]] is caused by several factors. Each journal title publishes unique research findings and as a result is a unique commodity that cannot be replaced in an academic library collection by another journal title, such as a less expensive journal on the same subject, as one could with commodities. The publisher thus has the ability to act as a [[monopolist]]. Scholarly journals vary greatly in quality as do the individual articles that they publish. The highest quality journals are often expected and demanded by scholars to be included in their institution's library collections, often with little regard or knowledge about the subscription costs. Traditional metrics for quality in scholarly journals include Impact Factor and Citation count as recorded by Journal Citation Reports.  This leads to [[Price elasticity of demand|price inelasticity]] for these higher quality journals.

== Publishers ==
{{Main|Academic publishing}}
Another possible set of factors in this situation includes the increasing domination of scholarly communication by a small number of commercial [[publishers]], whose journals are far more costly than those of most academic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~mcafee/Journal/Summary.pdf | publisher = Caltech | last = McAfee | title = Journal | contribution = Summary | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the institutional subscription prices for journals published by some academic society publishers (see below) have also exhibited inflationary patterns similar to those seen among commercial publishers.

The earnings of the [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS), for example, is based, in large parts, on publications. In 1999, the income of the ACS was $349 million, where $250 million came from information services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Returning Science to the Scientists| publisher = Münchner Buchwissenschaft an der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität| year = 2009| url = http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/ebook/aw/2004/tel.ccsd.cnrs.fr/tel-00002257-00/tel-00002257.pdf | accessdate = June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2004 House of Commons report (by the Science and Technology Committee),&lt;ref name="publications.parliament.uk"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Scientific Publications: Free for all?| publisher = House of Commons Science and Technology Committee| year = 2009| url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmsctech/399/399.pdf | accessdate = June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ACS is one of the driving forces of the STM (science, technology, medicine) serials crisis. According to the same report, the crisis started around 1990, when many universities and libraries complained about the dramatic inflation of STM subscription prices especially for the flagship JACS, which is exclusively sold as a bundle with all other ACS journals. The report further complains that
{{quote|the no–cancellation clauses attached to their multi-year multi-journal deals with Elsevier and the American Chemical Society had led to uneven cancellation of titles to make the budget balance. The result is that the little-used Elsevier and ACS titles must remain in the portfolio while the more popular titles by other publishers are cancelled.&lt;ref name="publications.parliament.uk"/&gt;}}

A typical inflation rate for 2008 included an increase of the bundle price of around 40% (from 22,800 USD to 30,200 USD) with a perspective of more than a doubling (to 55,000 USD) in the next three years.{{update inline|date=September 2013}}

== Trends in scholarly publishing ==
An additional problem is a dramatic increase in the volume of research literature and increasing specialization of that research, i.e. the creation of [[List of academic disciplines|academic subfields]].
This includes a growth in the number of scholars and an increase in potential demand for these journals.
At the same time, funds available to purchase journals are often decreasing in real terms. [[library|Libraries]] have seen their collection budgets decline in real terms compared to the United States Periodical Price Index. There are other library expenditures such as computers and networking equipment that have also had a negative impact on scholarly publishing. As a result of the increasing cost of journals, academic libraries have reduced their expenditures on other types of publications such as scholarly [[monograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherman|first1=Scott|title=University Presses Under Fire|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/179712/university-presses-under-fire?page=0,1|accessdate=6 March 2015|work=[[The Nation]]|issue=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Currency ==
Currency [[exchange rate]]s can serve to increase the volatility of subscription prices throughout the world. For example, many of the publishers of scientific journals are in Europe and do not set prices in [[United States dollar]]s, so the prices of such scholarly journals in the United States vary in relation to exchange rate fluctuations.

== Solutions, alternatives and developments ==
There is much discussion among case librarians and scholars about the crisis and how to address its consequences. Academic and research libraries are resorting to several tactics to contain costs, while maintaining access to the latest scholarly research for their users. These tactics include: increasingly borrowing journals from one another (see [[interlibrary loan]]) or purchasing single articles from commercial document suppliers instead of subscribing to whole journals. Additionally, academic and research libraries cancel subscriptions to the least used or least cost-effective journals. Another tactic has been converting from printed to electronic copies of journals, however, publishers sometimes charge more for the online edition of a journal, and price increases for online journals have followed the same inflationary pattern as have journals in paper format. Many individual libraries have joined co-operative consortia that negotiate license terms for journal subscriptions on behalf of their member institutions. Another tactic has been to encourage various methods of obtaining [[open access|free access]] to journals.

== Open access ==
Developed in part as a response to the serials crisis, [[open access]] models have included new models of financing scholarly journals that may serve to reduce the monopoly power of scholarly journal publishers which is considered a contributing factor to the creation of the serials crisis. These include [[open access journal]]s and [[open access repositories]].

'''''Spin Alternative Record Guide''''' is a music [[reference book]] compiled by the American music magazine ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' and published in 1995 by [[Vintage Books]]. It was [[editing|edited]] by [[rock music|rock]] critic [[Eric Weisbard]] and Craig Marks, who was the magazine's editor-in-chief at the time. The book features essays and reviews from a number of prominent critics on albums, artists, and genres considered relevant to the [[alternative music]] movement. Contributors who were consulted for the guide include [[Ann Powers]], [[Rob Sheffield]], [[Simon Reynolds]], [[Michael Azerrad]], and [[Robert Christgau]].

The book did not sell particularly well and received a mixed reaction from reviewers in 1995. The quality and relevance of the contributors' writing were praised, while the editors' concept and comprehensiveness of alternative music were seen as ill-defined. Nonetheless, it inspired a number of future music critics and helped revive the career of 1960s folk artist [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]], whose music was covered in the guide.

== Content and scope ==
Spanning 468 pages, ''Spin Alternative Record Guide'' compiles essays by 64 music critics on recording artists and bands who either predated, were involved in, or developed from the [[alternative music]] movement. In the book, each artist's entry is accompanied by their discography, with [[album]]s rated a score between one and ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon.|n.d.}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|2012|p=313}}; {{harvnb|Mazmanian|1995|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's editors, critic [[Eric Weisbard]] and ''Spin'' editor-in-chief Craig Marks, consulted journalists such as [[Simon Reynolds]], [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]], [[Charles Aaron]], [[Michael Azerrad]], [[Ann Powers]], and [[Rob Sheffield]], who wrote most of the complete discography reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon.|2012|p=313}}; {{harvnb|Perpetua|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The artist entries are also accompanied by song lyrics and [[album cover|album artwork]].{{sfn|Renaud|1995|p=77}}

[[File:Brooks-Christgau-Powers 01 (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|250px|Music critics [[Robert Christgau]] (left) and [[Ann Powers]] (right) contributed to the book.]]
Although "alternative" had been used as a catchall term for [[rock music|rock]] bands outside the [[mainstream]], ''Spin Alternative Record Guide'' covers approximately 500 artists from a variety of genres considered relevant to alternative music's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flagg|1995}}; {{harvnb|Perpetua|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These include 1970s [[punk rock]], 1980s [[college rock]], 1990s [[indie rock]], [[noise music]], [[reggae]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[new wave music|new wave]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[krautrock]], [[synthpop]], [[disco]], [[alternative country]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[grunge]], [[worldbeat]], and [[avant-garde jazz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renaud|1995|p=77}}; {{harvnb|Perpetua|2011}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most artists associated with [[classic rock]] are not covered, while some mainstream [[pop music|pop]] artists are given entries, including [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[ABBA]].{{sfn|Perpetua|2011}} Other non-rock artists reviewed in the book include jazz composer [[Sun Ra]], country singer-songwriter [[Lyle Lovett]], and [[Qawwali]] singer [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]].{{sfn|Flagg|1995}} Weisbard and Marks have said the book was meant to be "suggestive", rather than "comprehensive", of alternative music.{{sfn|Renaud|1995|p=77}}

An introductory essay on alternative rock and "alternative sensibilities" was written by Weisbard.{{sfn|Anon.|2012|p=313}} In it, he explains alternative music as a category whose principles are "antigenerationally dystopian, subculturally presuming fragmentation", and "built on an often neurotic discomfort over massified and commodified culture".{{sfn|Mazmanian|1995|p=70}} He and Marks consulted a number of artists for their top-ten record lists, which were interspersed throughout the book. They also curated a "Top 100 Alternative Albums" list for the appendix, ranking the [[Ramones]]' 1976 [[Ramones (album)|self-titled debut album]] at number one.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazmanian|1995|p=70}}; {{harvnb|Johnston|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication and reception ==
''Spin Alternative Record Guide'' was published by [[Vintage Books]] on October 10, 1995, and was the first book compiled by ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon.|n.d.}}; {{harvnb|Johnston|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Matthew Perpetua]], the guide was "not a huge seller".{{sfn|Perpetua|2011}}

Reviewing the book in 1995, Adam Mazmanian from ''[[Library Journal]]'' recommended ''Spin Alternative Record Guide'' to "both public and academic libraries". He found its reviews superior in "length and scope" to ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' (1992), which also offered complete discographies of artists ranging from [[Jonathan Richman]] to [[Throbbing Gristle]]. Mazmanian further argued that "this guide fills a gap in the literature of modern music" at a time when "alternative" has developed a ubiquitous presence in the marketing of [[popular music]].{{sfn|Mazmanian|1995|p=70}} In ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, [[Kim France]] called it "a well-edited, unpretentious, and comprehensive look at all the crazy stuff the kids are listening to these days".{{sfn|France|1995|p=96}} 

''[[Booklist]]'' critic Gordon Flagg was more qualified in his praise. He applauded the accuracy of the artist entries and the quality of the contributors' reviews, but found Weisbard's conception of "alternative" ill-defined and recommended ''[[Trouser Press|The Trouser Press Record Guide]]'' (1991) as a more comprehensive option.{{sfn|Flagg|1995}} Even more critical was ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's Beth Renaud, who called much of the writing biased and the organization unencyclopedic. She said Weisbard's "obligatory" essay is outdated and vague in defining alternative rock and that the contributors "gush" over artists usually covered by ''Spin''{{'}}s magazine publication, with many relevant artists omitted in place of more perplexing additions.{{sfn|Renaud|1995|p=77}}

== Legacy ==
Having edited the book, Weisbard put his pursuit of a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] on hold and accepted a job offer from ''Spin'', which marked the beginning of his career as a rock critic.{{sfn|Platt|2014}} Meanwhile, the guide's entry on 1960s folk guitarist [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]], written by [[Byron Coley]], helped renew interest in Fahey's music.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perpetua|2011}}; {{harvnb|Ratliff|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ben Ratliff from ''[[The New York Times]]'', this led to substantial interest in the guitarist from record labels and the alternative music scene, helping revive his career.{{sfn|Ratliff|1997}}

American pop culture critic [[Chuck Klosterman]] later cited ''Spin Alternative Record Guide'' as one of his five favorite books, saying in 2011, "I fear this might be out of print, but it's probably my favorite music book of all time. Since its 1995 publication, I doubt a year has passed when I didn't reread at least part of it."{{sfn|Malcolm|2011}} [[Robert Christgau]], who contributed to the book, wrote that while most music guides and encyclopedia books he has consulted were unremarkable, ''Spin Alternative Record Guide'' was one of the few "useful exceptions" because of what he felt was the "sharpest writing" from contributors such as Weisbard and Sheffield.{{sfn|Christgau|2000|p=xvii}} [[Maura Johnston]], on the other hand, said in retrospect that the book's list of the 100 best albums catered to "hipper, [[Generation X|Gen-Xier]] tastes".{{sfn|Johnston|2007}}

In 2011, ''Spin Alternative Record Guide'' was included in ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s list of their staff's favorite music books. In an essay accompanying the list, Perpetua said the book's writers—either top critics at the time or those who have since become important figures in [[music journalism]]—outline the "alternative sensibility" by recognizing and connecting music from disparate genres in "an inclusive, open-minded survey, but it's defined as much by what's left out—pretty much all [[Baby Boomer|Boomer]]-oriented rock—as what it includes." According to Perpetua, the "number of young readers [who] pursued music criticism" because of the book was far greater than the copies it sold.{{sfn|Perpetua|2011}} Matthew Schnipper, editor of ''[[The Fader]]'', bought the book after it was published and said he used it as a consumer guide for 10 years.{{sfn|Schnipper|2013}} Along with its influence on future critics, the book was cited by guitarist [[William Tyler (musician)|William Tyler]] as his only source of music education growing up in the pre-[[Internet age]], having found it in a bookstore around the time it was published: "They had entries for all these different people that I had never heard of: [[Can (band)|Can]], [[John Zorn]], [John] Fahey, whatever."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perpetua|2011}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teochew Letters''' ({{zh|p=Chaoshan Qiaopi|t=潮汕僑批}}) were a form of family correspondence combined with remittance, sent by [[Teochew people|Teochew]] immigrants in Southeast Asia (particularly [[Thailand]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]]) as well as [[Hong Kong]], to their families in the [[Chaoshan|Teochew region]] (now known as Chaoshan in Mandarin), in eastern [[Guangdong]] Province, China.&lt;ref name="teochewletters"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teochewletters.org/|title=Teochew Letters 潮州僑批|website=Teochew Letters 潮州僑批|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These letters were sent from the early 19th century till the 20th century. They were initially delivered by men known as ''zui-kheh'' (水客) literally   "Water Traveller", who travelled frequently between Southeast Asia and the Teochew region for business. Towards the end of the 19th century, delivery of the Teochew Letters became a full-fledged industry, known as the ''Qiaopi'' industry (侨批业). Qiaopi agencies in Southeast Asia collected the letters and remittances from the migrant workers and sent them to their corresponding partner in Swatow. The agencies in [[Shantou|Swatow]] then distributed the letters to local agencies located in the counties and villages of the Teochew region. The men employed to hand-deliver the letters and money to the families were known as ''phoe-kha'' (批脚), literally the "Feet of the Letters". The Qiaopi industry ended in 1979 when the government in China ordered its functions to be transferred to [[Bank of China]].&lt;ref name="teochewletters" /&gt;

Family correspondence combined with remittance was not unique to the Teochews. Other groups of overseas Chinese, including the [[Hokkien]], the [[Cantonese]] and the [[Hakka]], also used this method to communicate with their families. The Qiaopi agencies of the different groups served only their own community circle and their services did not overlap. An estimate of 170,000 Qiaopi letters have been collected by researchers and private collectors. The majority are Teochew Letters. The Museum of Overseas Remittance Mail Relics, based in Swatow, has a collection of 120,000 Teochew Letters, consisting of both originals and copies.&lt;ref name="陈胜生，十年磨一剑 —— “侨批档案”入选《世界记忆亚太地区遗产名录》回眸，汕头特区晚报，2012年6月03日"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.step.com.cn/html/2012-06/03/content_326705.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221324/http://www.step.com.cn/html/2012-06/03/content_326705.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Teochew Letters has immense historical value. It is an archive of the cultural and collective historical experiences of the Teochew people. Its contents reflect society at all levels, touching on international relations, national issues, and details of daily life important to families. As such, the information they contain bear intrinsic value for further research, as they are able to authenticate and supplement contemporary written history.

''Qiaopi'' (僑批) literally means the "Letter of the Overseas Chinese", with "phoe" (批) being the [[Southern Min]] expression for "letter". The term has sometimes been translated as Overseas Remittance Mail or Money Remittance Mail&lt;ref&gt;Choon Koshpasharin (2008)''Money remittance mail and overseas Chinese in S.E. Asia''Bangkok : Xu Maochun.  {{ISBN|978-9748410913}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these fail to capture the cultural aspect of the artefacts.

== Application for UNESCO Memory of the World Register ==

As part of the larger Archive of Overseas Remittance Mails, the Teochew Letters were added to the China Archival Heritage Register in 2010. Together with the Qiaopi collection of [[Jiangmen]], [[Meizhou]] and [[Fujian]], the Teochew Letters were included into the Asia/Pacific Regional Memory of the World (MOW) Register on 16 May 2012. Higher recognition is being sought through ongoing submission for inclusion in the prestigious [[Memory of the World Programme|UNESCO Memory of the World Register]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="teochewletters" /&gt;

To increase general awareness of the Teochew Letters and to promote the UNESCO Memory of the World Register application efforts, The Museum of Overseas Remittance Mail Relics launched an online museum for the Teochew Letters in June 2012. The website was created on behalf of the museum by the Cheung Kong School of Journalism of [[Shantou University]].&lt;ref name="teochewletters" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4004">'''UAVCAN''' is a lightweight protocol designed for reliable communication in aerospace and robotic applications via [[CAN_bus|CAN]] bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uavcan.org/|title=About UAVCAN|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Main features of UAVCAN are: 
*Democratic network - no single point of failure.
*Publish/subscribe or request/response exchange semantics.
*Allows efficient exchange of large data structures.
*Lightweight, easy to implement protocol.
*Supports network-wide time synchronization with microsecond precision.
*Doubly- or triply- redundant CAN bus.
*Can be used in deeply embedded, resource constrained, hard real-time systems.
*The specification and high quality reference implementations are open and free to use [https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT (MIT License)].

==Core design goals==
*'''Democratic network''' - There should be no master node. All nodes in the network should have the same communication rights so that there is no single point of failure.
*'''Nodes can exchange long payloads''' - Nodes must be provided with a simple way to exchange large data structures that cannot fit into a single CAN frame (such as GNSS solutions, 3D vectors, etc.). UAVCAN should perform automatic transfer decomposition and reassembly at the protocol level, hiding the related complexity from the application.
*'''Support for redundant interfaces and redundant nodes''' - This is a common requirement for safety-concerned applications.
*'''High throughput, low latency communication''' - Applications that are dependent on high-frequency, hard real-time control loops, require a low-latency, high-throughput communication method.
*'''Simple logic, low computational requirements''' - UAVCAN targets a wide variety of embedded systems, from high-performance embedded on-board computers for intensive data processing (e.g., a high-performance Linux-powered machine) to extremely resource-constrained microcontrollers. The latter imposes severe restrictions on the amount of logic needed to implement the protocol.
*'''Common high-level functions should be clearly defined''' - UAVCAN defines standard services and messages for common high-level functions, such as network discovery, node configuration, node firmware update, node status monitoring (which naturally grows into a vehicle-wide health monitoring), network-wide time synchronization, dynamic node ID allocation (a.k.a. plug-and-play), etc.
*'''Open specification and reference implementation''' - The UAVCAN specification is open and freely available; the reference implementations are distributed under the terms of the MIT License.

==Specification update and approval process==
The UAVCAN development team is charged with advancing the specification based on input from adopters. This feedback is gathered via the [http://uavcan.org/Contact/ mailing list], which is open to everyone.

The set of standard data definitions is one of the cornerstone concepts of the specification (see [http://uavcan.org/Specification/3._Data_structure_description_language/ data structure description language (DSDL)]). Within the same major version, the specification can be extended only in the following ways:

*A new data type can be added, possibly with default data type ID, as long as the default data type ID doesn’t conflict with one of the existing data types.
*An existing data type can be declared deprecated.
*Once declared deprecated, the data type will be maintained for at least two more years. After this period its default data type ID may be reused for an incompatible data type.
*Deprecation will be announced via the mailing list, and indicated in the form of a comment within the DSDL definition.

[[Image:Ernesto Teodoro Moneta.jpg|thumb|150px|Italian Nobel peace prize winner [[Ernesto Teodoro Moneta]] first adopted the motto ''In Varietate Concordia''/''In Varietate Unitas''.]]
'''Unity in diversity''' is a concept of "unity without uniformity and diversity without fragmentation"{{Sfn|Lalonde|1994}} that shifts focus from unity based on a mere tolerance of physical, cultural, linguistic, social, religious, political, ideological and/or [[Psychology|psychological]] differences towards a more complex unity based on an understanding that difference enriches human interactions. It has applications in many fields, including [[ecology]],{{Sfn|Lalonde|1994}} [[cosmology]], [[philosophy]],{{Sfn|Kalin|2004|page=430}} [[religion]]{{Sfn|Effendi|1938}} and [[politics]].{{Sfn|Eurominority|2004}} 

The idea and related phrase is very old and dates back to ancient times in both Western and Eastern Old World cultures. The concept of unity in diversity was used by both the [[indigenous peoples of North America]] and [[Taoist]] societies in 400–500 [[Before common era|B.C.]] In premodern Western culture, it has existed in an implicit form in certain organic conceptions of the universe that developed in the civilizations of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].{{Sfn|Lalonde|1994}} 

"Unity in diversity" is used as a popular [[slogan]] or [[motto]] by a variety of religious and political groups as an expression of harmony and unity between dissimilar individuals or groups. The phrase is a deliberate [[oxymoron]], the rhetorical combination of two antonyms, ''unitas'' "unity, oneness" and ''varietas'' "variety, variousness". When used in a political context, it is often used to advocate [[federalism]] and [[multiculturalism]].

==Origins==

The diversity is a permanent human condition.
The concept of unity in diversity can be traced back to [[Sufism|Sufi]] philosopher [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn al-'Arabi]] (1165–1240), who advanced the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] concept of the "oneness of being" (''wahdat al-wujud''), namely, that reality is one, and that God's is the only true existence; all other beings are merely shadows, or reflections of God's qualities.{{Sfn|Kalin|2004|pages=385-386}} [[Abd al-Karīm al-Jīlī]] (1366–1424) expanded on Al-'Arabi's work, using it to describe a holistic view of the universe which reflects "unity in diversity and diversity in unity" (''al-wahdah fi'l-kathrah wa'l-kathrah fi'l-wahdah'').{{Sfn|Kalin|2004|page=430}}

[[Leibniz]] used the phrase as a definition of "[[harmony]]" (''Harmonia est unitas in varietate'')  in his ''Elementa verae pietatis, sive de amore dei super omnia'' (1677/8).&lt;ref&gt;ed. Grua  (1948) I.12/A VI.4.1358. Leibniz glosses the definition with ''Harmonia est cum multa ad quandam unitatem revocantur'' "'Harmony' is when many [things] are restored to some kind of unity".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

The [[Old Javanese]] poem ''[[Kakawin Sutasoma]]'', written by Mpu Tantular during the reign of the [[Majapahit]] empire sometime in the 14th century, contains the phrase
''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]'', translated as "unity in diversity" or "out of many, one". ''Bhinneka Tunggal Ika'' is now the official [[national motto]] of [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="santoso"&gt;Santoso, Soewito ''Sutasoma, a Study in Old Javanese Wajrayana'' 1975:578. [[New Delhi]]: International Academy of Culture&lt;/ref&gt; The poem is notable as it promotes tolerance between [[Hindu]]s (especially [[Shaivite]]s) and [[Buddhist]]s, stating that although [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Shiva]] are different in substance, their truths are one:&lt;ref name="depkumham"&gt;[http://www.depkumham.go.id/xdepkumhamweb/xPeraturan/xUUD Depkumham.go.id] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212100545/http://www.depkumham.go.id/xdepkumhamweb/xPeraturan/xUUD |date=12 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|&lt;poem&gt;It is said that the well-known Buddha and Shiva are two different substances.
They are indeed different, yet how is it possible to recognise their difference in a glance,
since the truth of Jina (Buddha) and the truth of Shiva is one.
They are indeed different, but they are of the same kind, as there is no duality in Truth.&lt;/poem&gt;|''[[Kakawin Sutasoma]]'', canto 139, stanza 5}}

Unity in diversity is a prominent principle of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. In 1938, in his book ''The [[World Order of Bahá'u'lláh]]'', [[Shoghi Effendi]], the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]] of the Bahá'í Faith, said that "unity in diversity" was the "watchword" for the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink= Shoghi Effendi |year= 1938 |title= The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn= 0-87743-231-7 |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/index.html|accessdate=10 January 2014|ref={{SfnRef|Effendi|1938}}}}
{{citation|title=World Order of Bahá’u’lláh|first=Shoghi|last=Effendi|chapter=Unity in Diversity|publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust|location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA|isbn= 0-87743-231-7|year=1938|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-21.html|accessdate=10 January 2014|pages=41–42|ref={{SfnRef|Effendi|1938|pages=41-42}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abdul-Baha|`Abdu’l-Bahá]], the head of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] from 1892 to 1921, explained this principle in terms of the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|oneness of humanity]]: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ʻAbduʾl-Bahá|title=ʻAbduʾl-Bahá On Divine Philosophy|date=1918|publisher=Tudor Press|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|'' In reality all are members of one human family—children of one Heavenly Father. Humanity may be likened unto the vari-colored flowers of one garden. There is unity in diversity. Each sets off and enhances the other’s beauty. ''|}}

In [[Meher Baba]]'s ''Final Declaration'', he stated that "Unity in the midst of diversity can be made to be felt only by touching the very core of the heart. This is the work for which I have come. I have come to sow the seed of love in your hearts so that, in spite of all superficial diversity which your life in illusion must experience and endure, the feeling of oneness through love is brought about amongst all the nations, creeds, sects and castes of the world." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambppct.org/messages.php] Meher Baba's Final Declaration September 30th 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

''Unity in diversity'' is also a slogan utilized by the disciples of [[Swami Sivananda]]. They came to America to spread the true meaning of Unity in Diversity; that we are All in One &amp; One in All in an all loving ahimsa God.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sivananda.org/teachings/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In modern politics it was first used, as  ''In varietate unitas'', by [[Ernesto Teodoro Moneta]] in the context of [[Italian Unification]].

===Canada===
[[Adélard Godbout]], while Premier of Quebec, published an article entitled "Canada: Unity in Diversity" (1943) in the Council on Foreign Relations journal. He asked,{Sfn|Godbout|1943}{{cquote|''How does the dual relationship of the French Canadians make them an element of strength and order, and therefore of unity, in our joint civilization, which necessarily includes not only Canada and the British Commonwealth of Nations, but also the United States, the Latin republics of America and liberated France?''|}}
The phrase has since become somewhat of a staple of [[Multiculturalism in Canada|Canadian multiculturalism]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Adelard |last=Godbout |authorlink= Adelard Godbout |date=April 1943 |title= Canada: Unity in Diversity |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|volume=21|issue=3  |url= https://www.jstor.org/pss/20029241 |accessdate=10 January 2014|ref={{SfnRef|Godbout|1943}} }}

 |url=http://bahai-library.com/lalonde_unity_diversity|accessdate=9 January 2014|ref={{SfnRef|Lalonde|1994}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The phrase was invoked in the  [[Interdisciplinary]] Research Seminar (IRS) at [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] in the 1970s. Ervin Laszlo presented his paper entitled "Framework for a General Systems Theory of World Order" (1974) as one of the first seminar Papers that led to the establishment of the IRS in 1975.&lt;ref&gt; {{citation |last1=Nyiri|first1=Nicolas A.|last2=Preece|first2=Rod |year= 1977|volume=1 |title= Unity in Diversity |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |location=Waterloo, Ontario, Canada |isbn=0-88920-058-0 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WvqPE7vncdIC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=Introduction+to+Unity+in+Diversity:+The+Proceedings+of+the+Interdisciplinary+Research+Seminar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vpLLXRk752&amp;sig=GvfRy1u0_r_hT47tHByOfzpMHWk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O9A2T8x3jI3RAe_t4KQC&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 February 2012|ref={{SfnRef|Nyiri|Preece|1977}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Coat of arms of Saskatchewan|motto of the province of Saskatchewan]], adopted in 1986, is a variation, ''Multis e gentibus vires'' (from many peoples, strength).

===European Union===

In 2000, the [[European Union]] adopted 'United in Diversity' (Latin: ''In varietate concordia'')&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the EU replaced ''varietas'' by ''concordia'' "concord, cordial accord" in the Latin version and inverted word order. In the English version ''unity'' was retained (French ''unité'').&lt;/ref&gt; as official [[Motto of the European Union|motto]], a reference to the many and diverse [[members of the European Union|member states of the Union]] in terms of culture. Apart from its English form, the European Union's motto is also official in 23 other languages. "Unity in diversity" was selected by means of a competition involving students from member nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.eurominority.eu/version/eng/languages-motto.asp|title=European Motto in ''varietate concordia''|work=Eurominority|year=2004|accessdate=10 January 2014|ref={{SfnRef|Eurominority|2004}}}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/symbols/motto_en European Union official website] {{cquote|''It signifies how [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] have come together, in the form of the [[European Union|EU]], to work for peace and prosperity, while at the same time being enriched by the continent's many different cultures, traditions and languages.''|}}

===India===
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
[[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first [[Prime Minister of India]] and leader of the [[Indian National Congress]], vigorously promoted unity in diversity as an ideal essential to national consolidation and progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Superle|first1=Michelle|title=Contemporary English-Language Indian Children’s Literature: Representations of Nation, Culture, and the New Indian Girl|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136720871}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marangoly George|first1=Rosemary|title=Indian English and the Fiction of National Literature|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107729551}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote at length on this topic, exploring it in detail in his work ''[[The Discovery of India]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nehru|first1=Jawaharlal|title=The Discovery of India|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195623949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The diversity of India is tremendous; it is obvious; it lies on the surface and anybody can see it. It concerns itself with physical appearances as well as with certain mental habits and traits. There is little in common, to outward seeming, between the Pathan of the North-West and the Tamil in the far South. Their racial stocks are not the same, though there may be common strands running through them... Yet, with all these differences, there is no mistaking the impress of India on the Pathan, as this is obvious on the Tamil.

The Pathan and the Tamil are two extreme examples; the others lie somewhere in between. All of them have their distinctive features, all of them have still more the distinguishing mark of India.|''The Variety and Unity of India'', from ''The Discovery of India'', 1946}}

everywhere there was that tremendous impress of oneness, which had held all of us together for ages past, whatever political fate or misfortune had befallen us.|''The Search for India'', from ''The Discovery of India'', 1946}}

===Indonesia===
''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]'', an [[Old Javanese]] phrase translated as "Unity in Diversity" (''Out of many, one''), is the official [[national motto]] of [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="santoso" /&gt; It is a quotation from an Old Javanese poem [[Kakawin Sutasoma]], written by Mpu Tantular during the reign of the [[Majapahit]] empire sometime in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="depkumham" /&gt;

===South Africa===

When [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]] celebrated 20 years of independence on 31 May 1981, the theme of the celebrations was "unity in diversity". Anti-apartheid campaigners denounced the motto as    a cynical attempt to explain away the inequalities in South African life and called on runners of the [[Comrades Marathon]] to protest at the co-option of the event by wearing a black armband. The winner of the race, [[Bruce Fordyce]], was one of those wearing a black armband.
The term has since been incorporated into the preamble of the 1996 [[Constitution of South Africa]] as a central tenet of post-apartheid South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Bruce Fordyce: Comrades King|first=Brad|last=Morgan|url=http://www.southafrica.info/about/sport/greats/fordyce.htm|date=nd|ref={{SfnRef|Morgan|nd}}|access-date=2014-01-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110181721/http://www.southafrica.info/about/sport/greats/fordyce.htm|archive-date=2014-01-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A classic circular form spider's web.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Uttu was envisioned as a spider spinning a web.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=182}}{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}}]]
{{Mesopotamian myth|expanded=3}}

'''Uttu''' is an [[Sumerian religion|ancient Sumerian goddess]] associated with weaving.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=182}} The same [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] symbol used to write her name was also used to write the Sumerian word for "[[spider]]",{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=182}} indicating that Uttu was probably envisioned as a spider spinning a web.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=182}} She appears primarily in the myth of ''[[Enki]] and Ninsikila'', in which she resists the sexual advances of her father Enki by ensconcing herself inside her [[Spider web|web]], but he convinces her to let him in using a gift of fresh produce and the promise that he will marry her. Enki then intoxicates her with [[beer]] and [[rape]]s her. She is rescued by Enki's wife [[Ninhursag]], who removes Enki's [[semen]] from her [[vagina]] and plants it in the ground, resulting in the growth of eight new plants, which Enki later eats.

==Mythology==
===''Enki and Ninsikila''===
In the version of ''[[Enki]] and Ninsikila'' from [[Nippur]], Uttu is the daughter of Enki and [[Ninkurra]],{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}} but, in another version, Ninkurra instead gives birth to [[Nin-imma]],{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}} who mates with her father Enki and gives birth to Uttu as a result.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}} Uttu matures and becomes "shapely and decorous".{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}} Enki's wife [[Ninhursag]] warns Uttu that Enki will try to seduce her, as he has done with all his other daughters.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}} Uttu fortifies herself inside her [[Spider web|web]] and, when Enki comes to seduce her, she forces him to promise that he will marry her before she will have sex with him.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}} As marriage gifts, Uttu demands that Enki give her fruits and vegetables.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}} Enki finds a gardener, who demands that, in exchange for the fruits and vegetables, Enki must fill his [[irrigation]] ditches with water.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}} Enki fills the ditches and the gardener gives him the produce.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}}

Enki brings the produce to Uttu, who happily admits him into her web,{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}} but Enki gives Uttu [[beer]] to make her drunk and then [[rape]]s her.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}} Uttu screams and Ninhursag comes to rescue her.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}} Ninhursag removes Enki's [[semen]] from Uttu's vagina and plants it in the ground,{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}} causing eight plants to rise.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}} Later, Enki sees the plants and is annoyed because he does not recognize them.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}} [[Isimud]], Enki's ''sukkal'', or personal attendant, arrives, names each of the plants, and gives them to Enki to eat.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}} The account ends with the declaration that "Enki determined the nature of the grasses" and "had them know it in their hearts."{{sfn|Jacobsen|1987|page=184}}
