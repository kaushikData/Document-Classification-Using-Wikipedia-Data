'''30 Hudson Street''', also known as '''Goldman Sachs Tower''', is a {{convert|238|m|abbr=on}}, 42-story building in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. It is the [[List of tallest buildings in New Jersey|tallest building in New Jersey]]. Completed in 2004, the tower was designed by [[César Pelli]]. It houses offices, a cafeteria, a health unit, and a full-service fitness facility including a physical therapy clinic.  [[Provident Bank of New Jersey]] and [[Così (restaurant)|Così]] outlets are also located on the ground level, and open to the general public.

The building is in the [[Exchange Place, Jersey City|Exchange Place]] area close to a [[Exchange Place (PATH station)|PATH station]] and is accessible by the [[Hudson-Bergen Light Rail]] at the [[Essex Street (HBLR station)|Essex Street]] and [[Exchange Place (HBLR station)|Exchange Place]] stops.

The tower sits on the waterfront overlooking the [[Hudson River]] and [[Lower Manhattan]] and is visible from all five of the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|boroughs]]. On a clear day, the building may be visible from as far away as [[Highlands, New Jersey]] 40 miles south and [[Bear Mountain, New York]] 48 miles north.

Originally intended to be a dedicated use building for Goldman Sachs' middle and back office units, lower than projected staffing levels at the bank following the global financial crisis forced Goldman to seek occupancy from other tenants to avoid forgone rental income. [[Royal Bank of Canada]] currently shares the space, with plans for other professional service firms to take occupancy as well in the near future.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==History==
Originally the tower was meant to be the centerpiece of an entire Goldman Sachs campus at Exchange Place, which was to include a training center, a university, and a large hotel complex.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Many of the company's Manhattan-based equity traders refused to move away from [[Wall Street]], delaying the occupation of the building's top 13 floors, which remained vacant until early 2008.

Once a derelict and mostly industrial part of Jersey City, the Exchange Place area forms part of [[Gold Coast, New Jersey|New Jersey's Gold Coast]], a revitalized strip of land along the formerly industrial west bank of the Hudson. Economic development in the 2000s spurred large-scale residential, commercial, and office development along the waterfront.

Although the location was largely rejected by the company's financial executives, 4,000 Goldman Sachs employees made the move to the building, including much of the company's real estate, technology, operations, and administrative departments. The building is certified under [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-NC Version 2.0 of the [[Green building#United States|U.S. Green Building Council]].The building has been surrounded by pedestrian protective scaffolding since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2010/06/waterfront_walkway_around_gold.html|title=Waterfront walkway around Goldman Sachs in Jersey City reopening|work=NJ.com|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company completed construction of another tower in 2010 to house the bulk of their sales and trading departments. It is located at [[200 West Street]] in [[Lower Manhattan]] just north of [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|Brookfield Place]] (formerly the World Financial Center), almost directly across the water from 30 Hudson. Under their "[[Venice]] strategy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Goldberger, Paul | url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/08/02/040802crsk_skyline | title=Shanghai on the Hudson | work=The New Yorker | date=2 August 2004 |accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman Sachs works in conjunction with [[NY Waterway]] to shuttle workers between the two buildings on private ferries.

The building was used in 2016 by the [[Bernie Sanders]] presidential campaign to symbolize Goldman Sachs and [[Hillary Clinton]]'s ties to the company.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (January 29, 2016) [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/01/29/bernie_sanders_ad_attacks_goldman_sachs_wall_street_contributions.html "Bernie Sanders Ad Attacks Goldman Sachs, Wall Street Contributions"] ''[[RealClearPolitics]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aftershave''' is a liquid product applied to skin after [[shaving]]. It contains an [[antiseptic]] agent such as [[denatured alcohol]], stearate [[citrate]] or [[Witch hazel (astringent)|witch hazel]] to prevent infection of cuts, as well as to act as an [[astringent]] to reduce skin irritation. [[Menthol]] is used in some varieties as well to numb damaged skin, and it is an ingredient that [[shaving cream]] manufacturers have started including in their formulations, too.

An alcohol-based aftershave usually causes an immediate stinging sensation after applying it post-shave, with effects sometimes lasting several minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most commonly only for seconds. For this reason, a market consisting of highly differentiated products has been created—some using alcohols, some not.

Some aftershaves use [[fragrance]] or [[essential oil]] to enhance scent. [[Moisturizer]]s—natural and artificial, are often touted as able to soften the [[skin]].

Aftershave is sometimes mistakenly referred to as [[eau de cologne]] due to the very similar nature of the two products. Some aftershave manufacturers encourage using their fragranced aftershave as if it were cologne, in order to increase sales by encouraging consumers to use it in a more versatile manner, rather than just after a shaving session. Some aftershaves were inspired by a cologne.

Early aftershaves included [[witch-hazel]] and [[bay rum]], and have been documented in shaving guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/shavingmadeeasyw0020th |title=Shaving made easy; what the man who shaves ought to know .. : 20th century correspondence school, New York.

The ATP was originally developed for pyrolysis of oil sand.&lt;ref name=qian/&gt;&lt;ref name=fossilenergy/&gt;  However,  its first commercial application in 1989 was dedicated to the [[environmental remediation]] of contaminated soils.&lt;ref name=umatac/&gt;  From 1999 to 2004, ATP technology was used for [[shale oil extraction]] at the [[Stuart Oil Shale Project|Stuart Oil Shale Plant]] in Australia.&lt;ref name=qian/&gt;&lt;ref name=umatac/&gt;&lt;ref name=alex&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, {{convert|1.5|Moilbbl|sp=us|2}} of shale oil was extracted before the owner, Southern Pacific Petroleum Pty Ltd went into receivership.  The subsequent owner, [[Queensland Energy Resources]] closed and dismantled the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Technology==

The ATP is an above-ground oil-shale retorting technology classified as a [[Shale oil extraction|hot recycled solids]] technology.  The distinguishing feature of the ATP is that the drying and pyrolysis of the oil shale or other feed, as well as the combustion, recycling, and cooling of spent materials and residues, all occur within a single rotating multi-chamber horizontal retort.&lt;ref name=qian/&gt;&lt;ref name=umatac/&gt;&lt;ref name=ATPpatent&gt;
{{Cite patent|US|5366596}}''Dry thermal processor.''
&lt;/ref&gt; Its feed consists of fine particles.
[[Image:Alberta Taciuk Processor.PNG|thumb|540px|center|Alberta Taciuk Processor (ATP) retort]]
In its shale-oil applications, fine particles (less than {{convert|25|mm|in|1}} in diameter) are fed into the preheat tubes of the retort, where they are dried and preheated to {{convert|250|°C|°F|-1}} indirectly by hot shale ash and hot flue gas.&lt;ref name=qian/&gt; In the pyrolysis zone, oil shale particles are mixed with hot shale ash and the pyrolysis is performed at temperatures between {{convert|500|°C|°F|-1}} and {{convert|550|°C|°F|-1}}. The resulting [[shale oil]] vapor is withdrawn from the retort through a vapour tube and recovered by condensation in other equipment. The char residues, mixed with ash, are moved to the combustion zone, and burnt at about {{convert|800|°C|°F|-1}} to form shale ash. Part of the ash is delivered to the pyrolysis zone, where its heat is recycled as a hot solid carrier; the other part is removed and cooled in the cooling zone with the combustion gases by heat transfer to the feed oil shale.&lt;ref name=qian/&gt;&lt;ref name=brandt/&gt;

The advantages of the ATP technology for shale oil extraction lie in its simple and robust design, energy self-sufficiency,  minimal process water requirements, ability to handle fine particles, and high oil yields.&lt;ref name=fossilenergy/&gt; It is particularly suited for processing materials with otherwise low oil yield.&lt;ref name=opik&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The mechanical transfer of solids through the machine does not involve moving parts and it achieves improved process efficiencies through solid-to-solid heat transfer.&lt;ref name=fossilenergy/&gt;  Most of the process energy (over 80%) is produced by combustion of [[char]] and produced [[oil shale gas]]; external energy inputs are minimal.&lt;ref name=brandt/&gt; The oil yields are about 85–90% of [[Fischer Assay]].&lt;ref name=qian/&gt;  The organic carbon content of the process residue ([[spent shale]]) is less than 3%.&lt;ref name=fossilenergy/&gt;  The process produces only small amounts of contaminated water with low concentrations of [[phenols]].&lt;ref name=oilshale2&gt;

The '''Autobahn''' ({{Lang-de|Autobahn}} {{IPA-de|ˈʔaʊtoˌba:n|IPA|De-Autobahn.ogg}}, plural ''{{Lang|de|Autobahnen}}'') is the federal [[controlled-access highway]] system in [[Germany]]. The official German term is '''''{{Lang|de|Bundesautobahn}}''''' (plural ''{{Lang|de|Bundesautobahnen}}'', abbreviated ''BAB''), which translates as "federal motorway". The literal meaning of the word ''Bundesautobahn'' is "Federal Auto(mobile) Track".

German ''autobahnen'' have no federally mandated [[speed limit]] for some classes of vehicles.&lt;ref name="wa 16-09-2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Jeremic |first=Sam |title=Fun, fun, fun on the autobahn |url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/motors/a/-/motors/18958067/fun-fun-fun-on-the-autobahn/ |date=16 September 2013 |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, limits are posted (and enforced) in areas that are urbanised, substandard, accident-prone, or under construction. On speed-unrestricted stretches, an [[advisory speed limit]] (''{{Lang|de|[[Richtgeschwindigkeit]]}}'') of {{convert|130|km/h|mph}} applies. While going faster is not illegal as such in the absence of a speed limit, it can cause an increased liability in the case of an accident; courts have ruled that an "ideal driver" who is exempt from absolute liability for "inevitable" tort under the law would not exceed ''Richtgeschwindigkeit''.

A 2008 estimate reported that 52% of the autobahn network had only the advisory speed limit, 15% had temporary speed limits due to weather or traffic conditions, and 33% had permanent speed limits.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.etsc.eu/documents/Speed_Fact_Sheet_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements from the German State of [[Brandenburg]] in 2006 showed average speeds of {{convert|142|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on a 6-lane section of autobahn in free-flowing conditions.&lt;ref name=studie_tempolimit /&gt;

Germany's autobahn network has a total length of about {{convert|12996|km}} in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-portal.de/Statistik-Portal/de_jb16_jahrtab36.asp|title=Gemeinsames Datenangebot der Statistischen Ämter des Bundes und der Länder|author=Statistisches Landesamt Baden-Württemberg|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and a density of 36 motorway kilometres per thousand square kilometer (Eurostat) which ranks it among the most dense and longest controlled-access systems in the world, and fifth in density within the EU in 2016 (Netherlands 66, Finland 3). Longer similar systems can be found  [[Interstate Highway System|in the United States]] ({{convert|77,540|km}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author = Office of Highway Policy Information |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2016/hm20.cfm |title = Table HM-20: Public Road Length, 2016, Miles By Functional System |date = 18 September 2017 |access-date = 11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Expressways of China|and in China]] ({{convert|136,500|km}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politics.people.com.cn/n1/2018/0330/c1001-29899735.html|title=去年交通固定资产投资超3万亿 高速公路里程13.65万公里|publisher=人民网|date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However both the U.S. and China have an area nearly 30 times bigger than Germany, which demonstrates the high density of Germany's highway system.&lt;ref&gt;http://thenewswheel.com/the-history-of-autobahn/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
Only federally built controlled-access highways with certain construction standards including at least two lanes per direction are called ''Bundesautobahn''. They have their own white-on-blue signs and numbering system. In the 1930s, when construction began on the system, the official name was ''[[Reichsautobahn]]''. Various other controlled-access highways exist on the federal ''([[Bundesstraße]]),'' state ''([[Landesstraße]]),'' district, and municipal level but are not part of the ''Autobahn'' network and are officially referred to as ''Kraftfahrstraße'' (with rare exceptions, like [[Bundesautobahn 995|A 995]] Munich-Giesing–Brunntal). These highways are considered ''autobahnähnlich'' (autobahn-like) and are sometimes colloquially called ''Gelbe Autobahn'' (yellow autobahn) because most of them are ''Bundesstraßen'' (federal highways) with yellow signs. Some controlled-access highways are classified as "Bundesautobahn" in spite of not meeting the autobahn construction standard (for example the [[Bundesautobahn 62|A 62]] near [[Pirmasens]]).

==Construction==
[[File:Autobahn 10-999.png|thumb|right|Pattern of autobahns 10 to 999]]
Similar to high-speed motorways in other countries, autobahns have multiple lanes of traffic in each direction, separated by a central barrier with [[grade separation|grade-separated]] junctions and access restricted to motor vehicles with a top speed of more than {{convert|60|km/h|abbr=on}}. Nearly all exits are to the right. The earliest motorways were flanked by [[Shoulder (road)|shoulders]] about {{convert|60|cm}} in width, constructed of varying materials; right-hand shoulders on many autobahns were later retrofitted to {{convert|120|cm}} in width when it was realized cars needed the additional space to pull off the autobahn safely. In the postwar years, a thicker [[asphaltic concrete]] cross-section with full paved hard shoulders came into general use. The top design speed was approximately {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}} in flat country but lower design speeds were used in hilly or mountainous terrain. A flat-country autobahn that was constructed to meet standards during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi period]], could support the speed of up to {{convert|150|km/h|abbr=on}} on curves.

The current autobahn numbering system in use in Germany was introduced in 1974. All autobahns are named by using the capital letter A, which simply stands for "Autobahn" followed by a blank and a number (for example [[Bundesautobahn 8|A&amp;nbsp;8]]). The main autobahns going all across Germany have a single digit number. Shorter autobahns that are of regional importance (e.g. connecting two major cities or regions within Germany) have a double digit number (e.g. [[Bundesautobahn 24|A&amp;nbsp;24]], connecting Berlin and Hamburg). The system is as follows:

* A&amp;nbsp;10 to A&amp;nbsp;19 are in eastern Germany (Berlin, [[Saxony-Anhalt]], parts of [[Saxony]] and [[Brandenburg]])
* A&amp;nbsp;20 to A&amp;nbsp;29 are in northern and northeastern Germany
* A&amp;nbsp;30 to A&amp;nbsp;39 are in [[Lower Saxony]] (northwestern Germany) and Thuringia
* A&amp;nbsp;40 to A&amp;nbsp;49 are in the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] to [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main]]
* A&amp;nbsp;50 to A&amp;nbsp;59 are in the [[Lower Rhine region]] to [[Cologne]]
* A&amp;nbsp;60 to A&amp;nbsp;69 are in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Saarland]], [[Hesse]] and northern [[Baden-Württemberg]]
* A&amp;nbsp;70 to A&amp;nbsp;79 are in [[Thuringia]], northern [[Bavaria]] and parts of [[Saxony]]
* A&amp;nbsp;80 to A&amp;nbsp;89 are in [[Baden-Württemberg]]
* A&amp;nbsp;90 to A&amp;nbsp;99 are in (southern) [[Bavaria]]

There are also some very short autobahns built just for local traffic (e.g. [[ring road]]s or the [[Bundesautobahn 555|A&amp;nbsp;555]] from Cologne to Bonn) that usually have three digits for numbering. The first digit used is similar to the system above, depending on the region. East-west routes are always even-numbered, north-south routes are always odd-numbered.

The north-south autobahns are generally numbered using odd numbers from west to east; that is to say, the more easterly roads are given higher numbers. Similarly, the east-west routes are numbered using even numbers from north (lower numbers) to south (higher numbers).

}}
The idea for the construction of the autobahn was first conceived in the mid-1920s during the days of the [[Weimar Republic]], but the construction was slow, and most projected sections did not progress much beyond the planning stage due to economic problems and a lack of political support. One project was the private initiative ''[[HaFraBa]]'' which planned a "car-only road" crossing Germany from [[Hamburg]] in the north via central [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]] to [[Basel]] in Switzerland. Parts of the ''HaFraBa'' were completed in the late 1930s and early 1940s, but construction eventually was halted by [[World War II]]. The first public road of this kind was completed in 1932 between Cologne and Bonn and opened by [[Konrad Adenauer]] ([[Lord Mayor]] of Cologne and future [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor]] of West Germany) on 6 August 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The myth of Hitler's role in building the German autobahn|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,16144981,00.html|accessdate=4 August 2012|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=4 August 2012|author=W.

[[File:Rennstrecke Dessau,pfeilerlose Stahlbogenbrücke zwischen Zschepkau und Thalheim.jpg|thumb|left|One of the center pier-free bridges over the former ''Dessauer Rennstrecke'' on Autobahn A9]]

Just days after the 1933 [[Nazism|Nazi]] takeover, [[Adolf Hitler]] enthusiastically embraced an ambitious autobahn construction project, appointing [[Fritz Todt]], the Inspector General of German Road Construction, to lead it. By 1936, 130,000 workers were directly employed in construction, as well as an additional 270,000 in the supply chain for construction equipment, steel, concrete, signage, maintenance equipment, etc. In rural areas, new camps to house the workers were built near construction sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gartman, David|title=From Autos to Architecture: Fordism and Architectural Aesthetics in the Twentieth Century|url=https://www.amazon.com/From-Autos-Architecture-Architectural-Aesthetics/dp/1568988133/ |year=2009|publisher=Chronicle Books|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[job creation program]] aspect was not especially important because full employment was almost reached by 1936. The autobahns were not primarily intended as major infrastructure improvement of special value to the military as often stated. Their military value was limited as all major military transports in Germany were done by train to save fuel. The propaganda ministry turned the construction of the autobahns into a major media event that attracted international attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Tooze|title=The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-h_Z_KK0MQUC|year=2008|publisher=Penguin|pages=45–46, 59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The autobahns formed the first limited-access, high-speed road network in the world, with the first section from Frankfurt am Main to [[Darmstadt]] opening in 1935. This straight section was used for high-speed record attempts by the [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] racing teams of [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Auto Union]] until a fatal accident involving popular German race driver [[Bernd Rosemeyer]] in early 1938. The world record of {{Convert|432|kph|}} set by [[Rudolf Caracciola]] on this stretch just prior to the accident remains one of the highest speeds ever achieved on a public motorway. A similar intent in the 1930s existed for a ten-kilometre stretch of what is today [[Bundesautobahn 9]] just south of [[Dessau]]—called the [[Bundesautobahn 9#The ''Dessauer Rennstrecke''|''Dessauer Rennstrecke'']]—had bridges with no piers, meant for land speed record cars like the [[Mercedes-Benz T80]] to have made a record attempt [[Mercedes-Benz T80#Projections for the 1940 land speed record attempt|in January 1940]], abandoned due to the outbreak of [[World War II in Europe]] four months earlier.

During World War II, the [[median strip]]s of some autobahns were paved over to allow their conversion into [[Highway strip|auxiliary airstrips]]. Aircraft were either stashed in numerous tunnels or camouflaged in nearby woods. However, for the most part during the war, the autobahns were not militarily significant. Motor vehicles, such as trucks, could not carry goods or troops as quickly or in as much bulk and in the same numbers as trains could, and the autobahns could not be used by [[tank]]s as their weight and [[caterpillar track]]s damaged the road surface. The general shortage of petrol in Germany during much of the war, as well as the low number of trucks and motor vehicles needed for direct support of military operations, further decreased the autobahn's significance. As a result, most military and economic freight was carried by rail. After the war, numerous sections of the autobahns were in bad shape, severely damaged by heavy [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing]] and military demolition. Furthermore, thousands of kilometres of autobahns remained unfinished, their construction brought to a halt by 1943 due to the increasing demands of the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vahrenkamp.

The HAFRABA Association and the Autobahn Project 1933–1943 in Germany.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibwl.uni-kassel.de/vahrenkamp/history_mobility/arbeitspapiere/working_papers_history_mobility.htm |title=Working Papers in the History of Mobility No. 1/2001 |publisher=Ibwl.uni-kassel.de |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F088783-0003, Bei Bad Honnef, Ferienverkehr auf der A 3.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Bundesautobahn 3|A 3]] in 1991]]

In [[West Germany]] (FRG), most existing autobahns were repaired soon after the war. During the 1950s, the West German government restarted the construction program. It invested in new sections and in improvements to older ones. Finishing the incomplete sections took longer, with some stretches opened to traffic by the 1980s. Some sections cut by the [[Iron Curtain]] in 1945 were only completed after [[German reunification]] in 1990. Others were never completed, as more advantageous routes were found. Some of these incomplete sections to this very day stretch across the landscape forming a unique type of [[industrial archaeology|modern ruin]], often easily visible on satellite photographs.

The autobahns of [[East Germany]] (GDR) were neglected in comparison to those in West Germany after 1945. East German autobahns were used primarily for GDR military traffic and for state-owned farming or manufacturing vehicles. The speed limit on the GDR autobahns was 100&amp;nbsp;km/h; however, lower speed limits were frequently encountered due to poor or quickly changing road conditions. The speed limits on the GDR autobahns were rigorously enforced by the [[Volkspolizei]], whose patrol cars were frequently found hiding under camouflage tarpaulins waiting for speeders.

The last four kilometres of remaining original ''Reichsautobahn'', a section of [[Bundesautobahn 11|A 11]] northeast of [[Berlin]] near [[Gartz]] built in 1936—the westernmost remainder of the never-finished [[Berlinka]]—are scheduled for replacement around 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2013/09/30/Last-section-of-Germanys-Autobahn-to-disappear/UPI-89031380565722/ |title=Last section of Germany's Autobahn, built in 1936, to disappear |publisher=UPI.com |date=2013-09-30 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hitler's last motorway to disappear|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20130930/52167/|accessdate=2014-01-30|newspaper=[[The Local]]|date=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roadway condition is described as "deplorable"; the 25-metre-long concrete slabs, too long for proper expansion, are cracking under the weight of the traffic as well as the weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Haiko Prengel|url=https://www.welt.de/print/wams/motor/article120484851/Vier-Kilometer-Geschichte.html|title=Vier Kilometer Geschichte|work=[[Die Welt]]|language=German|date=2013-09-29|accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German-built ''Reichsautobahnen'' in other countries===
The first autobahn in Austria was the [[West Autobahn]] from [[Wals-Siezenheim|Wals]] near Salzburg to Vienna. Building started by command of [[Adolf Hitler]] shortly after the ''[[Anschluss]]'' in 1938. It extended the ''Reichsautobahn 26'' from Munich (the present-day [[Bundesautobahn 8|A8]]), however only {{convert|16.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} including the branch-off of the planned [[Tauern Autobahn]] was opened to the public on 13 September 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wabweb.net/verkehr/frames/abaltaf.htm |title=Beginn des Autobahnbaus in Österreich |language=German |publisher=Wabweb.net |date= |accessdate=14 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308080827/http://www.wabweb.net/verkehr/frames/abaltaf.htm |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction works discontinued the next year and were not resumed until 1955.

There are sections of the former German ''Reichsautobahn'' system in the [[former eastern territories of Germany]], ''i.e.'' [[East Prussia]], [[Farther Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]]; these territories became parts of Poland and the Soviet Union with the implementation of the [[Oder–Neisse line]] after World War II. Parts of the planned autobahn from Berlin to [[Königsberg]] (the ''[[Berlinka]]'') were completed as far as Stettin ([[Szczecin]]) on 27 September 1936. After the war, they were incorporated as the [[A6 autostrada (Poland)|A6 autostrada]] of the [[Highways in Poland|Polish motorway network]]. A single-carriageway section of the ''Berlinka'' east of the former "[[Polish Corridor]]" and the [[Free City of Danzig]] opened in 1938; today it forms the Polish [[Expressway S22 (Poland)|S22 expressway]] from [[Elbląg]] (Elbing) to the border with the Russian [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], where it is continued by the R516 regional road. Also on 27 September 1936, a section from Breslau ([[Wrocław]]) to Liegnitz ([[Legnica]]) in Silesia was inaugurated, which today is part of the Polish [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|A4 autostrada]], followed by the (single vehicle) ''Reichsautobahn 9'' from Bunzlau ([[Bolesławiec]]) to Sagan ([[Żagań]]) the next year, today part of the Polish [[A18 autostrada (Poland)|A18 autostrada]].

After the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], plans for a motorway connecting Breslau with Vienna via [[Brno]] (Brünn) in the "[[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]" were carried out from 1939 until construction works discontinued in 1942. A section of the former ''Strecke 88'' near Brno is today part of the [[R52 expressway (Czech Republic)|R52 expressway]] of the Czech Republic.

==Current density==
{{as of|2016}}, Germany's autobahn network has a total length of about 12,993&amp;nbsp;km. From 2009 Germany has embarked on a massive widening and rehabilitation project, expanding the lane count of many of its major arterial routes, such as the A5 in the southwest and A8 going east-west.

Most sections of Germany's autobahns are modern, containing two or three, sometimes four lanes in addition to an emergency lane ([[hard shoulder]]). A few other sections remain in an old state, with two lanes, no emergency lane, and short slip-roads and ramps.

The motorway density in Germany is 36 kilometers per thousand square kilometer in 2016, close to the small near countries ( Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Slovenia)&lt;ref&gt;Eurostat&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Facilities==

===Emergency telephones===

}}

About 16,000 [[emergency telephone]]s are distributed at regular intervals all along the autobahn network, with triangular stickers on the armco barriers pointing the way to the nearest one. Despite the increasing use of mobile phones, there are still some 700 calls made each day on average.

For the [[Emergency service]] or [[Roadside assistance]] to come to the right location, the road kilometre must be given as part of the emergency call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rv24.de/direkt/ratgeber/erstehilfe/notruf.jsp|title=R+V24 Ratgeber: Auto und Motorrad|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parking, rest areas and truck stops===
[[File:BAB-A6-km-565.jpg|thumbnail|Road kilometre sign German federal motorway "Autobahn 6", km 565.0 near Mannheim]]

For breaks during longer journeys, parking sites, [[rest area]]s and [[truck stop]]s are distributed over the complete Autobahn network. Parking on the autobahn is prohibited in the strictest terms outside these designated areas. There is a distinction between "managed" and "unmanaged" rest areas. (German: ''bewirtschaftet'' / ''unbewirtschaftet'').

[[File:Zeichen 314.svg|50px|left|Parking sign]] Unmanaged rest areas are basically only parking spaces, sometimes with toilets. They form a part of the German highway system; the plots of land are federal property. Autobahn exits leading to such parking areas are marked 200 metres in advance with a blue sign with the white letter "P". They are found every few kilometres.

A managed rest area (German: ''Autobahnraststätte'' or ''Raststätte'' for short) usually also includes a [[filling station]], [[charging station]], lavatories, toilets and baby changes. Many rest areas also have restaurants, shops, public telephones, internet access and a playground. Some have hotels. Mandated every 50&amp;nbsp;km or so, rest areas are usually open all night.

Both kinds of rest areas are directly on the autobahn, with their own exits, and any service roads connecting them to the rest of the road network are usually closed to general traffic. The autobahn must not be left at rest areas.

[[File:Zeichen 448.1 - Autohof, StVO 2000.svg|75px|left]] Truck stops (German ''Autohof'', plural ''Autohöfe'') are far rarer. Located at general exits, usually at a small distance from the autobahn, they have no ramps of their own.

Rest areas and truck stops are marked several times, starting several kilometres in advance, and with larger signs that often include icons announcing what kinds of facilities travellers can expect.

Germany's autobahns are famous for being among the few public roads in the world without blanket [[speed limit]]s for cars and motorcycles.  As such, they are important German cultural identifiers, "... often mentioned in hushed, reverential tones by motoring enthusiasts and looked at with a mix of awe and terror by outsiders."&lt;ref name="wa 16-09-2013" /&gt; Some speed limits are implemented on different autobahns.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.autobahnatlas-online.de/Limitkarte.pdf map] with its associated [http://www.autobahnatlas-online.de/LegendeLimit_e.pdf legend].&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the accident a subject at the next annual meeting of the commission or whether a so-called special meeting will be called was still unclear. The commission deals only with collision black spots.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other danger points like sections under construction or in need of repair.

Where no general limit is required, the advisory speed limit is {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}, referred to in German as the ''[[Richtgeschwindigkeit]]''. The advisory speed is not enforceable; however, being involved in an accident driving at higher speeds can lead to the driver being deemed at least partially responsible due to "increased operating danger" (''Erhöhte Betriebsgefahr'').

The Federal Road Research Institute (''Bundesanstalt für Straßenwesen'') solicited information about speed regulations on autobahns from the [[Germany#Constituent states|sixteen States]] and reported the following, comparing the years 2006 and 2008:

Except at construction sites, the general speed limits, where they apply, are usually between {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} and {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}; construction sites usually have a speed limit of {{convert|80|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} but the limit may be as low as {{convert|60|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.derwesten.de/staedte/nachrichten-aus-dinslaken-huenxe-und-voerde/60-km-h-erlaubte-hoechstgeschwindigkeit-auf-der-autobahn-59-id7114757.html|title=60 km/h erlaubte Höchstgeschwindigkeit – auf der Autobahn 59|first=Ralf|last=Kubbernuß|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rare cases, sections may have limits of {{convert|40|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwzonline.de/blaulicht/a-29-an-neun-baustellen-gilt-tempo-40_a_1,0,583992771.html|title=A 29: An neun Baustellen gilt Tempo 40|author=Christoph Koopmeiners|date=29 September 2011|work=NWZonline|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or on one ramp {{convert|30|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/niedersachsen/braunschweig_harz_goettingen/Tempo-30-Es-blitzt-und-blitzt-an-der-Autobahn,blitzer560.html|title=Tempo 30: Es blitzt und blitzt an der Autobahn|author=NDR|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain stretches have lower speed limits during wet weather. Some areas have a speed limit of {{convert|120|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in order to reduce noise pollution during overnight hours (usually 10pm&amp;nbsp;– 6am) or because of increased traffic during daytime (6am&amp;nbsp;– 8pm).

[[File:Verkehrszeichen auf der Bundesautobahn 20090320 001.JPG|thumb|Dynamic traffic signs on an Autobahn]]
Some limits were imposed to reduce pollution and noise. Limits can also be temporarily put into place through dynamic traffic guidance systems that display the according message. More than half of the total length of the German autobahn network has no speed limit, about one third has a permanent limit, and the remaining parts have a temporary or conditional limit.

Some cars with very powerful engines can reach speeds of well over {{convert|300|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}. Major German car manufacturers, except [[Porsche]], follow a ''[[gentlemen's agreement]]'' by [[Governor (device)#Automobiles|electronically limiting]] the top speeds of their cars—with the exception of some top of the range models or engines—to {{convert|250|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/news/grenzenlos-das-250-km-h-limit-broeckelt-659443.html "Grenzenlos&amp;nbsp;– das 250 km/h-Limit bröckelt"], ''[[Auto, Motor und Sport]]'' {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These limiters can be deactivated, so speeds up to {{convert|300|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} might arise on the German autobahn, but due to other traffic, such speeds are generally not attainable except during certain times like between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. or on Sundays (when trucks drivers have to rest by law). Furthermore, there are certain autobahn sections which are known for having light traffic, making such speeds attainable during most days (especially some of those located in Eastern Germany). Most unlimited sections of the autobahn are located outside densely populated areas.

Vehicles with a top speed less than {{convert|60|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} (such as [[all-terrain vehicle|quads]], low-end microcars, and agricultural/construction equipment) are not allowed to use the autobahn, nor are motorcycles and scooters with low engine capacity regardless of top speed (mainly applicable to [[moped]]s which are typically limited to 25 or 45&amp;nbsp;km/h anyway). To comply with this limit, heavy-duty trucks in Germany (e.g. mobile cranes, tank transporters etc.) often have a maximum design speed of {{convert|62|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} (usually denoted by a round [[black-on-white]] sign with "62" on it), along with flashing orange beacons to warn approaching cars that they are travelling slowly. There is no general minimum speed but drivers are not allowed to drive at an unnecessarily low speed as this would lead to significant traffic disturbance and an increased collision risk.

However, after the crisis eased in 1974, the [[Bundesrat of Germany|upper house of the German parliament]], which was controlled by [[CDU/CSU|conservative parties]], successfully resisted the imposition of a permanent mandatory limit supported by [[Willy Brandt#1972 crisis|Chancellor Brandt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41784192.html|title=Verkehr: Blut sehen|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper house insisted on a {{Convert|130|km/h|0|abbr=on}} recommended limit until a thorough study of the effects of a mandatory limit could be conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41722019.html|title=Letzte Chance für Vernunft im Verkehr|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the Federal Highway Research Institute conducted a multiple-year experiment, switching between mandatory and recommended limits on two test stretches of autobahn.

====Environmental concerns of the 1980s====
In the mid-1980s, [[acid rain]] and sudden [[Forest dieback#History|forest destruction]] renewed debate on whether or not a general speed limit should be imposed on autobahns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13508443.html|title=Verkehr: Trick mit Zahlen|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13511022.html|title=Tempolimit: Taktik statt Taten|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A car's fuel consumption increases with high speed, and fuel conservation is a key factor in reducing air pollution. Environmentalists argued that enforcing limits of {{Convert|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}} limit on autobahns and {{Convert|80|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on other rural roads would save lives as well as the forest, reducing the annual death toll by 30% (250 lives) on autobahns and 15% (1,000 lives) on rural roads;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13512710.html|title=Tempo 100 rettet 1250 Menschenleben|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the German motor vehicle death toll was about 10,000 at the time.&lt;ref name="http://www.bast.de 2014"&gt;{{cite web

====German reunification====
Prior to [[German reunification]] in 1990, [[New states of Germany|eastern German states]] focused on restrictive traffic regulation such as a {{convert|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}} autobahn speed limit and of {{convert|80|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on other rural roads.  Within two years after the opening, availability of high-powered vehicles and a 54% increase in motorized traffic led to a doubling of annual traffic deaths,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/06/990616165539.htm&lt;/ref&gt; despite "interim arrangements [which] involved the continuation of the speed limit of {{convert|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on autobahns and of {{convert|80|km/h|0|abbr=on}} outside cities". An extensive program of the four ''E''s (enforcement, education, engineering, and [[Emergency medical services|emergency response]]) brought the number of traffic deaths back to pre-unification levels after a decade of effort while traffic regulations were conformed to western standards (e.g., {{convert|130|km/h|0|abbr=on}} freeway advisory limit, {{convert|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on other rural roads, and [[Blood Alcohol Content#Limits by country .28BAC: Blood Alcohol Content.29|0.05 percent BAC]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Since reunification====
In 1993, the Social democratic-Green Party coalition controlling the State of Hesse experimented with a {{Convert|90|km/h|0|abbr=on}} limit on autobahns and {{Convert|80|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on other rural roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lagis.online.uni-marburg.de/de/subjects/idrec/sn/edb/id/4894|title=Zeitgeschichte in Hessen – Daten, Fakten, Hintergründe|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502040213/http://lagis.online.uni-marburg.de/de/subjects/idrec/sn/edb/id/4894|archive-date=2 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These limits were attempts to reduce [[Ozone#Health effects|ozone pollution]].

During his term of office (1998 to 2005) as Chancellor of Germany, [[Gerhard Schröder]] opposed an autobahn speed limit, famously referring to Germany as an ''Autofahrernation'' (a "nation of drivers").

In October 2007, at a party congress held by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], delegates narrowly approved a proposal to introduce a blanket speed limit of {{Convert|130|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on all German autobahns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1677432,00.html|title=No More Fun on the Autobahn?|date=29 October 2007|work=TIME.com|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this initiative is primarily a part of the SPD's general strategic outline for the future and, according to practices, not necessarily meant to affect immediate government policy, the proposal had stirred up a debate once again; Germany's chancellor since 2005, [[Angela Merkel]], and leading cabinet members expressed outspoken disapproval of such a measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Car lobby angry at plan to limit autobahn speeds|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/30/germany.international|accessdate=1 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 October 2007|author=Kate Connolly|agency=Guardian News and Media Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[Bremen state election, 2007|Social Democratic-Green Party coalition]] controlling Germany's smallest State, [[Bremen (state)|the paired City-State of Bremen &amp; Bremerhaven]], imposed a 120-kilometre-per-hour (75&amp;nbsp;mph) limit on its last {{convert|11|km|miles}} of speed-unlimited autobahn&lt;ref name="Der Spiegel"&gt;{{cite web

Bei insgesamt 6 587 sogenannten Geschwindigkeitsunfällen kamen 179 Menschen zu Tode, das heißt nahezu die Hälfte (46,3 %) aller Getöteten auf Autobahnen... (Seite 20) Hierbei ist allerdings zu berücksichtigen, dass die Unfallursache „nicht angepasste Geschwindigkeit“ häufig nicht bedeutet, dass die zulässige Höchstgeschwindigkeit überschritten worden ist. „Nicht angepasste Geschwindigkeit“ wird von der Polizei bei einem Unfall auch dann als Ursache erfasst, wenn ein Beteiligter für die vorliegenden Straßen- oder Witterungsverhältnisse zu schnell gefahren ist.

|quote=den stellvertretenden Kommandanten der Feuerwehr aus Hohenschäftlarn (Kreis München), Daniel Buck... war mit seinen Kollegen einer der ersten an der Unfallstelle, an der ein Porschefahrer (51) so schnell in den Toyota einer 67-jährigen Weilheimerin bretterte, dass sich ihr Auto mehrmals überschlug. Die Frau musste noch vor Ort reanimiert werden, starb jedoch später im Krankenhaus. Die beiden Männer im Porsche kamen mit leichten Verletzungen davon... Auf Höhe des Dreiecks Starnberg verlor er auf der linken Spur die Kontrolle über sein Auto. Er kam ins Schleudern, schoss rechts über einen Grünstreifen und kam auf dem Zubringer aus Starnberg wieder auf die Fahrbahn. Dort rammte er die 67-jährige Weilheimerin in ihrem Toyota... Zeugen vor Ort schätzen, dass der Sportwagen mit rund 300 Kilometer pro Stunde unterwegs war... Ein Zeuge hatte seinen Tempomat auf 140 Stundenkilometer eingestellt und war von dem Sportwagen überholt worden. „Er schätzt, der Porsche war doppelt so schnell“, sagt Buck. Und: „...Schneller wie 160 Kilometer pro Stunde ist hier absolut unangemessen.“. [Translation: deputy commander of the fire brigade from Hohenschaeftlarn county (Munich), Daniel Buck...was one of the first with his colleagues at the accident site where a Porsche driver (age 51) bashed into the Toyota driven by a 67-year-old [[Weilheim in Oberbayern]] resident, rolling her car over several times. The woman had to be resuscitated on site, but died later in hospital. The two men in the Porsche escaped with minor injuries... At the peak of the Starnberg interchange in the left lane he lost control of his car. He went into a skid, shot right through a grass strip to ram the 67-year-old Weilheimer resident in her Toyota... Witnesses on site estimated that the sports car was traveling about 300 kilometers per hour... One witness had his cruise control set at 140 kilometers per hour and was overtaken by the sports car. "He estimates the Porsche was twice as fast," says Buck. And: "This is simply irresponsible; even as fast as 160 kilometers per hour is absolutely inappropriate. "]

For example, a person yearly traversing {{convert|15000|km}} on regular roads and {{convert|10000|km}} on motorways has an approximately {{nowrap|1 in 11,000}} chance of dying in a car accident on a German road in any particular year ({{nowrap|1 in 57,000}} on an autobahn), compared to {{nowrap|1 in 3,800}} in Czech Republic, {{nowrap|1 in 17,000}} in Denmark, or {{nowrap|1 in 7,200}} in the United States.

However, there are many differences between countries in their geography, economy, traffic growth, highway system size, degree of urbanization and motorization, and so on.

==Toll roads==
On 1 January 2005, a new system came into effect for mandatory tolls ''(Mautpflicht)'' on heavy trucks (those weighing more than 12 t) while using the German autobahn system (''[[LKW-Maut]]''). The German government contracted with a private company, ''[[Toll Collect|Toll Collect GmbH]]'', to operate the toll collection system, which has involved the use of vehicle-mounted transponders and roadway-mounted sensors installed throughout Germany. The toll is calculated depending on the toll route, as well as based on the pollution class of the vehicle, its weight and the number of axles on the vehicles. Certain vehicles, such as emergency vehicles and buses, are exempt from the toll. An average user is charged €0.15 per kilometre, or about $0.31 per mile (Toll Collect, 2007).

Driving in Germany is regulated by the Straßenverkehrs-Ordnung (''road traffic regulations'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stvo_2013/ |title=StVO 2013&amp;nbsp;– nichtamtliches Inhaltsverzeichnis |publisher=Gesetze-im-internet.de |date= |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; abbreviated StVO). Enforcement on the federal Autobahnen is handled by each state's [[Highway Patrol]] (''[[Autobahnpolizei]]''), often using unmarked police cars and motorcycles and usually equipped with [[Road-rule enforcement camera|video cameras]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=von Stefan Jacobs |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/mit-dem-videowagen-unterwegs-beim-blitzmarathon-der-ganz-normale-wahnsinn-auf-berlins-strassen/8916704.html |title=Mit dem Videowagen unterwegs beim Blitzmarathon: Der ganz normale Wahnsinn auf Berlins Straßen|language=German|work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|date= |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksta.de/region/autobahn-polizei-mit-der-kamera-gegen-raser,15189102,12017330.html|title=Autobahn-Polizei: Mit der Kamera gegen Raser|language=German|work=[[Kölner Stadtanzeiger]]|date=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus allowing easier enforcement of laws such as [[tailgating]]. Notable laws include the following.
* The right lane should be used when it is free (''Rechtsfahrgebot'') and the left lane is generally intended only for overtaking unless traffic is too dense to justify driving only on the right lane. It is legal to give a short horn or light signal (flashing headlights or ''Lichthupe'') in order to indicate the intention of overtaking, but a safe distance to the vehicle in front must be maintained,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stvo_2013/__5.html|title=StVO&amp;nbsp;– Einzelnorm |publisher=Gesetze-im-internet.de |date= |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise this might be regarded as an act of [[coercion]].
* Penalties for [[tailgating]] were increased in May 2006 to a maximum of €375 and three months' license suspension:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Fines go up as Germans get tough on tailgaters
|date=4 May 2006
|quote=Drivers who ride the bumper of the car in front of them can now expect a fine of up to 375 euros (nearly $470), a rise of nearly 100 euros from the previous maximum, said Sven Stadtrecher, a German police liaison officer to the U.S. military in Heidelberg. Drivers can also lose their license for up to three months. Before the new regulations went into effect, a monthlong suspension was the maximum penalty, he said. Fines will start at 35 euros for a speed of 80 kilometers an hour, Stadtrecher said, adding that drivers must keep a distance in meters that is equal to half their speed. For example, a driver going 100 km/h on the autobahn must keep a distance of at least 50 meters (165 feet). Fines and penalties will increase at higher speeds and will also take into account how long the driver tailgates.

The 21-year-old woman lost control of her car after swerving sharply to the right to avoid the Mercedes, which prosecutors said approached at up to 250 kilometers an hour (155 mph) to within a few meters of her bumper. She spun across two lanes and smashed into a bank of trees.

* In a traffic jam, drivers must form an emergency lane (''Rettungsgasse'') to allow emergency services to reach the scene of an accident. This improvised alley is to be created on the dividing line between the two leftmost lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stvo_2013/__11.html |title=StVO&amp;nbsp;– Einzelnorm |publisher=Gesetze-im-internet.de |date= |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is unlawful to stop for any reason on the autobahn, except for emergencies and when unavoidable, like traffic jams or being involved in an accident. This includes stopping on emergency lanes. Running out of fuel is considered an avoidable occurrence, as by law there are petrol stations directly on the autobahn approximately every {{convert|50|-|55|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Drivers may face fines and up to six months' suspension, should it come to a stop that was deemed unnecessary by the police. In some cases (if there is a direct danger to life and limb or property e.g. cars and highway infrastructure) it may also be considered a crime and the driver could receive a prison sentence (up to 5 years). &lt;!-- § 18 (8) highway code and § 315b criminal code --&gt;
* Overtaking on the right (undertaking) is strictly forbidden, except when stuck in traffic jams. Up to a speed of {{convert|80|km/h|4=0|abbr=on}} it is permitted to pass cars on the right side if the speed difference is not greater than {{convert|20|km/h|4=0|abbr=on}} or the vehicle on the left lane is stationary. This is not referred to as overtaking, but driving past. Even if the car overtaken is illegally occupying the left-hand lane, it is not an acceptable excuse; in such cases, the police will routinely stop and fine both drivers. However, exceptions can and have sometimes been made.

==In popular culture==

===Film and television===
* ''[[Alarm für Cobra 11 – Die Autobahnpolizei]]'' (''Alarm for Cobra 11 – The Autobahn Police'', 1996–), a famous German TV series focusing on the work of a team of motorway police officers and their investigations, set in the autobahn-intertwined [[Rhine-Ruhr]] metropolitan area.
* ''Reichsautobahn'' (documentary/b&amp;w) by [[:de:Hartmut Bitomsky|Hartmut Bitomsky]] (West Germany, 1986)

===Music===
* "[[Autobahn (song)|Autobahn]]", a song and album by German electronic band [[Kraftwerk]] (1974)

===Video games===
''[[Need for Speed: ProStreet]]'', ''[[Burnout 3: Takedown]]'', and ''[[Burnout Dominator]]'' use autobahn as one of their tracks. ''[[Euro Truck Simulator]]'', ''[[German Truck Simulator]]'', and ''[[Euro Truck Simulator 2]]''  features the Autobahn in its open world map.  ''Burnout 3: Takedown'' named them as Alpine while ''Burnout Dominator'' divided them into two (Autobahn and Autobahn Loop).
''[[Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed]]'' also had a track that had the player drive across different sections of the autobahn. The entire game world of ''[[Crash Time: Autobahn Pursuit]]'' is set on the autobahn.
On ''[[Gran Turismo 5]]'' and ''[[Gran Turismo 6]]'', a trophy is awarded to those who have driven the same distance as the autobahn total length. In December 2010 video game developer Synetic GmbH and [[Conspiracy Entertainment]] released the title ''[[Alarm für Cobra 11&amp;nbsp;– Die Autobahnpolizei]]'' featuring real world racing and mission-based gameplay. It is taken from the popular German television series about a two-man team of ''Autobahnpolizei'' first set in Berlin then later in North Rhine-Westphalia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6951">'''Barbara Nitke''' (born 1950) is a New York City art photographer who specializes in the subject of human [[sexual relations]]. She has worked extensively in the porn and [[BDSM]]  communities.

Nitke was born in [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], [[Virginia]] in 1950 and grew up in Virginia and [[Alaska]]. She is currently a fashion/art photographer, and is on the faculty of the [[School of Visual Arts]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sva.edu/faculty/barbara-nitke SVA]&lt;/ref&gt; in New York.

== Nitke and the porn business ==

Hailed by The Village Voice for her quest "to find humanity in marginal sex",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/1998-11-24/news/slap-happy/ Village Voice]&lt;/ref&gt; Nitke has gained worldwide attention for her affecting and powerful photographs chronicling relationships between consenting adults engaged in [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] activities.

Her documentation of sexuality began in 1982 on the sets of [[pornographic films]], towards the end of the [[Golden Age of Porn]].&lt;ref name=Nitke&gt;[http://www.therialtoreport.com/2013/04/14/podcast-06-barbara-nitke-porns-on-set-photographer/ 'Barbara Nitke: Porn's On Set Photographer'], The Rialto Report, audio podcast interview with Barbara Nitke&lt;/ref&gt; She worked in the industry for twelve years as a set photographer on hundreds of adult films. Her photographs from this period reveal the combination of boredom, surrealism, vulnerability and dissociation inherent in the X-rated world.&lt;ref name=Nitke /&gt; During that time she also became active as a photographer on mainstream television and movie sets, work which she continues today.

In 1991, after the hardcore porn business moved to Los Angeles, she began shooting on the New York sets of [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] and SM movies, which had become the fastest growing segment of the adult film industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wmg2JmqwOrsC&amp;pg=PT90&amp;lpg=PT90&amp;dq=Philosophy+for+Everyone:+How+to+Think+With+Kin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f34kmYI0Uv&amp;sig=ygFdAQHyPX-WZ-n_ERz6fnYRZXw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GB1ZT-25LOnH0AHf5rm5Dw&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=chapter%2015&amp;f=false "Philosophy for Everyone: How to Think With Kink" by Roger T. Pipe]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years later she attended her first meeting of [[The Eulenspiegel Society]], the oldest SM support and educational group in the country, to see a presentation by underground photographer [[Charles Gatewood]]. The couples she met in the SM scene fascinated her, and she began photographing them in 1994. They became the focus of her book, ''Kiss of Fire: A Romantic View of Sadomasochism'' (2003). It was among the first mainstream publications to examine the subject of BDSM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barbaranitke.com/portlandpressherald.html "Exploring Myths of a Sexual Subculture" by Bob Keyes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitke ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to produce her second book, ''Barbara Nitke: American Ecstasy'' (2012), a memoir in pictures and words of her hardcore porn days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1990714042/american-ecstasy-photo-book American Ecstasy on Kickstarter]&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Nitke v. Gonzales'' ==
In 2001, Nitke filed a lawsuit, along with co-plaintiff the [[National Coalition for Sexual Freedom]], challenging the constitutionality of the [[Communications Decency Act]], a federal statute prohibiting the publication of [[obscenity]] on the Internet.  The case was called ''Nitke v. Ashcroft'', then later changed to ''[[Nitke v. Gonzales]]''.

Nitke and the NCSF argued that while the [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Miller v. California 415 U.S. 13 (1973)|Miller v. California]]'' defines obscenity according to community standards, the Internet does not permit publishers to restrict the dissemination of their speech based on geography.  Therefore, the plaintiffs claimed, a person posting sexually explicit material on the Internet could be found criminally liable according to the standards of the most restrictive community in the country.  This, Nitke said, would chill her freedom of speech and therefore violate her [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights.

A three-judge panel of the [[United States District Court]] for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District of New York]] conducted a trial, and in 2005 found that Nitke and the NCSF had presented insufficient evidence that the variation in community standards is substantial enough to chill the plaintiffs' speech.  On March 20, 2006, the [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] [https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/032006pzor.pdf affirmed that ruling] without opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/read/american-ecstasy-a-chat-with-barbara-nitke Nitke interview with Vice]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Desmond Keegan''' is an Irish academic.

== Education ==
He attended the [[University College Dublin]] where he pursued a BA in Classical European Civilization and his MA in Medieval European Civilization. Keegan laid the foundations differentiating Distance Education from regular study. In 1979 he initiated the international journal ''Distance Education'', which is now in its 36th year of publication. This was the first publication of its kind to focus on Distance Education as a new area of scholarship. Keegan proposed some of the fundamental issues that are still outstanding. Some of the issues include ''The Role of Time Synchronous Technology'', ''Access Equity and Social Impact of Distance Education'', ''Didactics or Skills Required by Learners and Teachers in using Electronic Technology'' and ''The Market and Willingness of Students to Partake in Electronic Classrooms.''

==Publications==
Keegan's doctoral thesis was published by Groom Helm named Foundations of Distance Education in 1986. In 1990 the second edition was published by Routledge followed by the third in 1996. This was translated into Italian in 1994 and Chinese in 1997. His work was also chosen as a set text for the [[Open University]] of the United Kingdom for the MA in Open and Distance Education in 1997. In his extended work in 1996 he laid the foundation of Distance Education different from regular study.

He has published ten books on distance education and related subjects:

==Contributions to distance education==

Keegan entered the field of [[distance education]] in 1978 when he was appointed Head of School at the South Australian government College of External Studies (SACES)&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, D.(2000)''Distance training: taking stock at a time of change.''London:Routledge p47&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 he founded an international journal on distance education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/sdie20/current&lt;/ref&gt; Today in its 36th year it remains a leading journal in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, T. and Zawacki-Richter, O.(2011) The geography of distance education - bibliographic characteristics of a journal network. ''Distance Education, v32, n3, pp441-456''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 he founded a series of academic volumes on the theory and practice of distance education, called the ''Routledge Studies in Distance Education Series.''20 volumes were published between 1992-2003. Professor A. Tait of the Open University of the United Kingdom, became joint executive editor during the course of the Series&lt;ref&gt;https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-studies-in-Distance-Education/book-series/SE0907&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Keegan’s major theoretical contribution on the theory and practice of distance education was termed ‘the reintegration of the teaching acts’.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, D. (1993) 'Reintegration of the teaching acts' in Keegan, D. (ed)Theoretical principles of distance education London: Routledge, pp 113-134&lt;/ref&gt; It focused on the characteristic of distance education of the separation of the teacher and the learner, contrary to nearly 2000 years of history of education in the West. The daily work of the distance educator is to reintegrate the teaching acts shattered by the benefits of distance education.
 
He carried out a census study of distance education in the European Union on 1 January 1996 counting every student enrolled in every distance education institution in every one of the, then, 15 member states, with 889.893 enrolled in government distance training institutions, 997.967 in correspondence schools and colleges, 462.784 in the 5 open universities and 151.192 in distance education courses from conventional universities for a total of 2.350.795 students. This showed that distance education was the chosen form of training for over 2.000.000 European students per year and at an average enrolment fee of between €100 and €1000 per year was a largely unknown and unstudied billion euro European training industry. This research was published by the European Commission in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, D. (1997) Distance training in the European Union. Brussels: European Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

Keegan  also contributed to the development of a new form of distance education which he called ‘mobile learning’ (distance education on smartphones and small tablets). In 1999 he developed his first project in the field for the European Commission and this was funded in early 2000&lt;ref&gt;	Keegan, D. et al (2002) The future of learning.

'''Digital program insertion''' ('''DPI''') allows [[Cable television headend|cable headends]] and broadcast affiliates to insert locally generated commercials and short programs into remotely distributed regional programs before they are delivered to home viewers.

Digital program insertion also refers to a specific technology which allows an [[MPEG transport stream]] to be spliced into a currently flowing MPEG transport stream seamlessly and with little or no artifacts. The controlling signaling used to initiate an MPEG is referred to as an [[SCTE-35]] message. The communication API between MPEG splicers and [[content delivery]] servers or ad insertion servers is referred to as SCTE30 messages.

A '''digital ticket''' is a [[Virtuality|virtual]] instance of a [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]] which represents the [[Digitizing|digitization]] of rights to claim goods or services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Fujimura |first=Ko |author2=Nakajima, Yoshiaki |title=General-purpose Digital Ticket Framework |booktitle=Proceedings of the 3rd USENIX Workshop on Electronic Commerce |publisher=[[USENIX]] |year=1998 |pages=177–186 |url=http://www.usenix.org/events/ec98/full_papers/fujimura/fujimura_html/fujimura.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
A digital ticket must fulfill the following criteria:
* Secure (unable to alter or counterfeit)
* Portable (physical independence)
* Off-line capable
* Wide acceptability (In order to have the ticket generally accepted, some level of trust is needed.)
* User-friendly

In addition, another three requirements are also important for digital tickets, they are:
* Viewable
:The terms and description of the service should be objectively understood by both the service provider and consumer or owner, so the value of the ticket can be determined. Moreover, this is an essential property to trace the digital ticket.

* State manageable
:Tickets may also have a payment status, i.e., paid or unpaid, and/or reservation status, e.g., waiting list, reserved, or canceled. The status may be changed dynamically. In addition, the ticket ownership can be rewritten when the ticket is transferred. However, it is difficult to allow these changes while still guaranteeing security.

* (De)Composable
:Combining two or more tickets is sometimes required to obtain a service or one ticket may comprise several parts. For example, a travel ticket can comprise an accommodation ticket and a plane ticket or a car rent ticket.

Besides the criteria mentioned above, there are still several features that should be concerned, such as anonymity, transferability and  repetitive usability.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Fujimura |first=Ko |author2=Nakajima, Yoshiaki |title=General-purpose Digital Ticket Framework |booktitle=Proceedings of the 3rd USENIX Workshop on Electronic Commerce |publisher=[[USENIX]] |year=1998 |pages=177–186 |url=http://www.usenix.org/events/ec98/full_papers/fujimura/fujimura_html/fujimura.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifecycle==
The ticket is first issued by the service provider or issuer. The ownership of a ticket may change after it was issued, by transferring the ticket. Either the issuer or owner of ticket might view the status of the ticket. Finally, it is redeemed by the current owner at the service provider.
[[Image:Digitalticket.png]]

===Creation===
From creator's point of view, each digital ticket has certain structure, this could be expressed in a multilayer architecture depicted as follows:

[[Image:Digitalticketlayer.png|right]]
Layer 1

Common ticket properties that do not depend on the ticket type:
* Issuer
* Promise (Details are given in upper layers)
* Owner
* Transferability
* Number of times to be consumed
* Valid period
* View
* Issuer's signature on above

Layer 2
:Ticket properties defined by each industry

Layer 3
:Ticket properties defined by each issuing company or individual
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Fujimura |first=Ko |author2=Nakajima, Yoshiaki |title=General-purpose Digital Ticket Framework |booktitle=Proceedings of the 3rd USENIX Workshop on Electronic Commerce |publisher=[[USENIX]] |year=1998 |pages=177–186 |url=http://www.usenix.org/events/ec98/full_papers/fujimura/fujimura_html/fujimura.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfer===
Depending on the purpose of the ticket, it may be transferred. During the transfer process, the ticket should be visible to both parties involved. After the transfer process is done, the ownership of ticket has changed. The history of transfer should be recorded in either the ticket itself or the central database.

===View===
Ability to view the ticket is important to both the service provider and the owner of the ticket. The owner needs to know what his ticket actually is and the service provider needs to verify the ticket during redemption. The view could be achieved by properly designed hardware.

===Redemption===
A digital ticket always has certain value that could be redeemed at service provider. Normally after redeeming, the ticket is cleaned. Some tickets work for a period, and will only be deleted after this period. In the special case when the ticket isn't given away after redeeming, it is called a pass.

==Implementation==
In order to make an implementation of the digital ticket system, a combination of two paradigms can be used. The first is the account-based system, which relies on central storage and network connections. The second is the smartcard-based system, which uses decentralized storage to store and transfer the ticket.

===Account-based system===
In an account-based system for tickets, the rights of the tickets are managed in accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Matsuyama |first=Kazuo |author2=Fujimura, Ko |title=Distributed digital-ticket management for rights trading system |booktitle=Proceedings of the 1st ACM conference on Electronic commerce |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]]|pages=110–118 |year=1999 |url=http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=337020&amp;type=pdf&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=ACM&amp;CFID=50095260&amp;CFTOKEN=24026233}}{{Dead link|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ticket changes in accounts can be made by communicating with a so-called account manager through a network. The trust in these systems can be seen from the service provider's and user's perspective, in which the former generally manages the whole system. This leads to an imbalanced trust relationship. Two other disadvantages of these systems are the need for protection of accounts against malicious users and the relatively large efforts that need to be done to store all the accounts for both the users and the service provider.

====Storage====
Generally, the storage and maintaining tasks of the account are assigned to the service provider. This leads to costs and efforts on his side. In some cases these systems could be shared by different service providers, but a need to make general agreements remains. Since the service provider normally has full control over the accounts, tickets could be deleted or altered and after that refuse to fulfill the service the initial ticket stands for.

====Authentication====
Typically ID and password are used in account-based systems to authenticate a user. This does not prevent fraud by the service provider. Several digital-cash systems deal with this by having a secret key generated at the user's PC, which remains out of hands of the service provider. This, however, is not sufficient when tickets are redeemed at the real service provider.

====Prevention of duplicate redemption====
Since the account management is completely in control of the service providers, unwanted actions such as copying tickets can easily be detected and traced back by them.

===Smart card-based system===
In [[smart card]]-based systems, tickets are stored on a smart card and are circulated by putting two smart cards in a reader and completing the transaction. The smart card itself takes care of the calculations that need to be done for safe transferring.

====Storage====
Tickets are stored on the smart cards. The smart cards can be provided by both the users and the service providers. The performance of current smart cards is limited, which makes asynchronous trading difficult. Different service providers are likely to use different standards, which makes it mandatory to have a different smart cards for different kinds of tickets.It is very useful to passengers.

====Authentication====
A secret key can be implemented in the smart card, which makes it possible to carry the card around and redeem a ticket without using a network connection. When the service provider distributes and issues the private keys on these cards, fraud from malicious service providers is still an issue. This also makes it hard for different service providers
to share a smart card.

====Prevention of duplicate redemption====
Storage is generally maintained by the service provider. The smart card needs to be protected against multiplication. However, if the system is broken security is completely lost.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2633">The '''Doktoringenieur''' (acronym '''Dr.-Ing.''', also ''Doktor der Ingenieurwissenschaften'') is the [[Germany|German]]  [[engineering]] [[doctorate]] degree, comparable to the [[Doctor of Engineering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dict.cc/german-english/Doktoringenieur.html |title=English-German translation for: Doktoringenieur |publisher=dict.cc|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Engineering Doctorate]], [[Doctor of Science|Doctor of Science (Engineering)]], [[Doctor of Science|Doctor of Science (Technology)]] or a [[PhD]] in Engineering or Architecture.

It was first introduced in 1899, in the context of the centenary of the [[Technical University of Berlin]], at the [[Prussia]]n [[Technische Hochschule|Institutes of Technology]]. The other German states adopted it in the following years. In contrast to the other historic doctoral degrees (e.g. ''Dr. phil.'', ''Dr. jur.'' or ''Dr. med.''), the Doktoringenieur was not titled in Latin but German, and therefore written with dash (Dr.-Ing.).

In the field of mathematics, computer science and natural sciences, some universities offer the choice between ''Dr.-Ing.'' and ''Dr. rer. nat.'' based on the primary focus of the dissertation. If the contributions focus slightly more on applied scientific engineering a ''Dr.-Ing.'' is given, while a ''Dr. rer. nat.'' is preferred if the dissertation contains more theoretical scientific contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mathematik.rwth-aachen.de/global/show_document.asp?id=aaaaaaaaaeebmw |title=Promotionsordnung für die Fakultät für Mathematik, Informatik und Naturwissenschaften der Rheinisch-Westfälischen Technischen Hochschule Aachen vom 27.09.2010|publisher=RWTH Aachen|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be worth noting that a [[Doctorate#Germany|German doctorate]] is usually a research doctorate and is awarded in the context of the so-called promotion that also requires a dissertation.

It should not be confused with a [[List of academic ranks#Netherlands|Dutch]] double title ''dr. ing.'', indicating one holds a [[Doctor (title)|doctorate]] (Dr.) as well an [[Engineer's degree#The Netherlands|engineer's degree]] (Ing.) from a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] polytechnic (i.e. [[Hogeschool]]).&lt;ref name="onzetaal.nl"&gt;{{cite web|author=Aleid Fokma |url=http://www.onzetaal.nl/advies/titulatuur3.php |title=Bachelor-mastertitulatuur: titels combineren |publisher=Onzetaal.nl |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elegant glass''' is high quality glassware created in the United States during the [[Depression Era]]. It was sold for high prices in department stores and given as wedding gifts.&lt;ref name="dep-v-eleg"&gt;"Elegant Glass is Not Depression Glass | Just Glass Online." Designer Glassware, Vintage Art Glass, Depression Glass &amp; Collectible Glass | Just Glass Online. Stephen Thornton Internet Consulting Services. Web. 8 January 2010. &lt;http://www.justglass-online.com/collectibles/elegant-glass-is-not-depression-glass.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; When new, Elegant glass would cost more than its oft-confused counterpart, [[Depression glass]], because it was at least partially handmade, had a cleaner finish, and more vibrant colors. From the 1920s through the 1950s, Elegant glass was an alternative to [[Porcelain|fine china]]. Most of the Elegant glassware manufacturers closed by the end of the 1950s, and cheap glassware and imported china took its place.

==Manufacturing process==
Elegant glass was at least partially hand made during production.&lt;ref&gt;"Depression Glass, Elegant Glass and Depression Glass Manufacturers | Just Glass Online." Designer Glassware, Vintage Art Glass, Depression Glass &amp; Collectible Glass | Just Glass Online. Stephen Thornton Internet Consulting Services. Web. 7 January 2010. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justglass-online.com/depression-glass/depression-glass-elegant-glass-and-depression-glass-manufacturers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231093700/http://www.justglass-online.com/depression-glass/depression-glass-elegant-glass-and-depression-glass-manufacturers.html |archivedate=31 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Elegant glass manufacturers produced vibrant colors that varied far more than Depression Glass.&lt;ref name="dep-v-eleg"/&gt;  Shades of red, blue, green, amber, yellow, smoke, amethyst, and pink were produced.  An easy way to compare the difference in color quality is to take a look at a piece of cobalt Elegant glass and place it alongside a piece of cobalt Depression Glass.  The intensity of the former piece is quite evident. Pressed Elegant glass was fire polished to get rid of the flaws in the glass. The normal flaws found in pressed glass – straw marks, raised seams, etc. were removed. The base of bowls, platters, etc. was ground so it would sit evenly on a table. Many patterns of Elegant glass were embellished with acid etching, cutting, enamel decoration, gold encrustation, platinum and gold trim.&lt;ref name="dep-v-eleg"/&gt;

==Sale and marketing==
Elegant glass was sold in the finer stores (never given away). It was also marketed as wedding patterns. It was offered as an alternative to china and crystal which were still imported due to manufacturing costs and were incredibly expensive. Many consumers purchased Elegant glass and placed it on display, only using it for very special occasions.&lt;ref name="dep-v-eleg"/&gt;

==Products==
Elegant glass patterns had a wide range of items available including:

===Tableware===
Tableware included plates, bowls, platters, sherbets, salt and pepper shakers, compotes, creamers, sugar bowls, epergnes, mayonnaise bowls, place holders, baskets, candy dishes, cruets, bells, candlesticks, cheese stands, bread and butter plates, baskets, bon bons, jam/jelly jars, tidbit trays, nut dishes, celery dishes, pickle dishes, lamps, cracker jars, oil and vinegar bottles, marmalade jars, and vases.&lt;ref name="cambridge"&gt;"CAMBRIDGE CAPRICE-CLEAR at Replacements, Ltd."

'''''Extreme Engineering''''' is a [[documentary film|documentary]] [[television series]] that aired on the [[Discovery Channel]] and the [[Science Channel]]. The program featured [[future|futuristic]] and ongoing [[engineering]] projects. The series' last season aired in July 2011. [[Danny Forster]] first hosted the series in season 4 and has been the host since season 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/engineering/meet/meet.html|title= Discovery Channel::Meet the Host|accessdate=July 23, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105214729/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/engineering/meet/meet.html|archivedate=January 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the show ==
''Engineering the Impossible'' was a 2-hour special, created and written by Alan Lindgren and produced by [[Powderhouse Productions]] for the Discovery Channel. It focused on three incredible, yet physically possible, engineering projects: the {{convert|9|mi||adj=mid|-long|spell=in}} [[Strait of Gibraltar crossing|Gibraltar Bridge]], the 170-story [[Millennium Tower (Tokyo)|Millennium Tower]] and the over {{convert|4000|ft||adj=mid|-long}} [[Freedom Ship]]. This program won the [[Beijing]] International Science Film Festival Silver Award, and earned Discovery's second-highest weeknight rating for 2002. After the success of this program, Discovery commissioned Powderhouse to produce the first season of the 10-part series, ''Extreme Engineering'', whose episodes were written by Alan Lindgren, Ed Fields and several other Powderhouse writer-producers. Like ''[[Engineering the Impossible]]'', the first season of ''Extreme Engineering'' focused on extreme projects of the future. Season 2 (and all seasons since) featured projects already in construction around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4157">A '''fuel cell auxiliary power unit''' ('''FC-APU''') is a [[fuel cell]] based [[auxiliary power unit]] on a [[vehicle]] that provides energy for functions other than propulsion. They are mainly used in trucking, aviation, marine and recreational vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navigantresearch.com/research/fuel-cells-for-auxiliary-power-unit-applications fuel cells for auxiliary power unit applications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002722/http://www.navigantresearch.com/research/fuel-cells-for-auxiliary-power-unit-applications |date=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4184">'''Germanane''' is a single-layer crystal composed of [[germanium]] with one hydrogen bonded in the z-direction for each atom. In [[material science]], great interest is shown in related single layered materials, such as [[graphene]], composed of carbon, and silicene, composed of [[silicon]]. Such materials represent a new generation of semiconductors with potential applications in [[computer chip]]s and [[solar cells]].&lt;ref name=Bianco2013&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bianco | first1 = E. | last2 = Butler | first2 = S. | last3 = Jiang | first3 = S. | last4 = Restrepo | first4 = O.

C|date=2011|volume=115|page=13242|doi=10.1021/jp203657w|arxiv=1204.2875}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore [[graphene]].  Bulk germanium does not adopt this structure.  Germanane has been produced in a two-step route starting with calcium germanide. From this material, the calcium is removed by de-intercalation with HCl to give a layered solid with the empirical formula GeH.&lt;ref name=kurz/&gt; The Ca sites in Zintyl-phase CaGe2 interchange with the H atoms in the HCl solution, which leaves us with GeH and CaCl2.

== Properties ==
Germanane's [[electron mobility]] is predicted to be more than ten times that of silicon and five times more than conventional germanium. Hydrogen-doped germanane is chemically and physically stable when exposed to air and water.&lt;ref name=kurz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/germanane-may-replace-silicon-for-lighter-faster-electronics |title=‘Germanane’ may replace silicon for lighter, faster electronics |publisher=KurzweilAI |date= |accessdate=2013-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germanane has a “[[direct band gap]],” easily absorbing and emitting light, and potentially useful for [[optoelectronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amamou|first1=W.|last2=Odenthal|first2=P. M.|last3=Bushong|first3=E. J.|last4=O'Hara|first4=D. J.|last5=Luo|first5=Y. K.|last6=van Baren|first6=J.|last7=Pinchuk|first7=I.|last8=Wu|first8=Y.|last9=Ahmed|first9=A.

K.|title=Large area epitaxial germanane for electronic devices|journal=2D Materials|date=2015|volume=2|page=035012|doi=10.1088/2053-1583/2/3/035012|bibcode=2015TDM.....2c5012A}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Conventional silicon and germanium have indirect band gaps, reducing light absorption or emission.) In addition, the Ge atoms have higher spin-orbit coupling (as compared to C in graphene/graphane) which can allow us to explore the quantum spin Hall effect.

== Electrical and Optical Properties ==

Researchers at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and the University of Ioannina in Greece, have reported on the first field effect transistor fabricated with germanane, highlighting its promising electronic and optoelectronic properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2053-1583/aa57fd/meta&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nanotechweb.org/cws/article/tech/67839&lt;/ref&gt; Germanane FET's show transport in both electron and hole doped regimes with on/off current ratio of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;(10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) and carrier mobilities of 150 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (V.s)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(70 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (V.s)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 77 K (room temperature). A significant enhancement of the device conductivity under illumination with 650 nm red laser is observed.

Worldwide '''growth of photovoltaics''' has been an [[Exponential growth|exponential curve]] between 1992–2017. During this period of time, [[photovoltaics]] (PV), also known as solar PV, evolved from a niche market of small scale applications to a mainstream electricity source. When [[solar PV system]]s were first recognized as a promising [[renewable energy]] technology, programs, such as [[feed-in tariff]]s, were implemented by a number of governments in order to provide economic incentives for investments. For several years, growth was mainly driven by Japan and pioneering European countries. As a consequence, cost of solar declined significantly due to [[experience curve effects]] like improvements in technology and [[economies of scale]].

Experience curves describe that the price of a thing decreases with the sum-total ever produced.  PV growth increased even more rapidly when production of [[solar cell]]s and [[Solar panel|modules]] started to ramp up in the USA with their [[Million Solar Roofs]] project, and when renewables were added to China's 2011 five-year-plan for energy production.&lt;ref name="guardian-china"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lacey |first1=Stephen |title=How China dominates solar power |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/12/how-china-dominates-solar-power |work=Guardian Environment Network |accessdate=29 June 2014 |date=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, deployment of photovoltaics has gained momentum on a worldwide scale, particularly in Asia but also in North America and other regions, where solar PV by 2015–17 was increasingly competing with [[conventional energy]] sources as [[grid parity]] has already been reached in about 30 countries.&lt;ref name="deutsche-2015-chasm"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.db.com/cr/en/docs/solar_report_full_length.pdf |title=Crossing the Chasm |publisher=Deutsche Bank Markets Research |date=27 February 2015
 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XSrEw1QL |archivedate=1 April 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

Projections for photovoltaic growth are difficult and burdened with many uncertainties.

Historically, the [[Solar power in the United States|United States]] was the leader of installed photovoltaics for many years, and its total [[Nameplate capacity|capacity]] amounted to 77 [[megawatt]]s in 1996—more than any other country in the world at the time. Then, [[Solar power in Japan|Japan]] was the world's leader of produced solar electricity until 2005, when [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]] took the lead and by 2016 had a capacity of over 40 gigawatts. However, in 2015, China became world's largest producer of photovoltaic power,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/china-solar-idUSL3N15533U&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2442764/chinese-solar-capacity-outshone-germanys-in-2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cleantechnica.com/2016/01/22/china-overtakes-germany-become-worlds-leading-solar-pv-country/&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2017 became the first country to surpass the 100 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg-News-CHN-70GW"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-16/china-targets-70-gigawatts-of-solar-power-to-cut-coal-reliance.html |title=China Targets 70 Gigawatts of Solar Power to Cut Coal Reliance  |website=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=16 May 2014 |accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CleanTechnica"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2015/03/19/chinas-national-energy-administration-17-8-gw-new-solar-pv-2015/ |title=China’s National Energy Administration: 17.8 GW Of New Solar PV In 2015 (~20% Increase) |work=CleanTechnica |date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; China is expected to be the leader in installed PV capacity, and along with India and US, it is forecasted to be the largest market for solar PV installations in the coming decade.

By the end of 2017, cumulative photovoltaic capacity reached about 401 [[gigawatt]]s (GW), estimated to be sufficient to supply 2.1% of global electricity demand.&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-snapshot-1992-2017" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/renewable-energy/solar-energy.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEA-PVPS-2016" /&gt; Solar contributed 8%, 7.4% and 7.1% to the respective annual domestic consumption in [[Solar power in Italy|Italy]], [[Solar power in Greece|Greece]] and Germany.&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-snapshot-1992-2015" /&gt; The European Photovoltaic Industry Association, a solar industry trade group, claims installed worldwide capacity will more than double or even triple to more than 500&amp;nbsp;GW between 2016 and 2020;&lt;ref name="epia-2015" /&gt; by 2050, it claims [[solar power]] will become the world's largest source of electricity. Such an achievement would require PV capacity to grow to 4,600&amp;nbsp;GW, of which more than half was forecast to be deployed in China and [[Solar power in India|India]].&lt;ref name="IEA-roadmap-PV-2014" /&gt;

== Current status ==

[[Nameplate capacity]] denotes the peak power output of power stations in unit watt [[Unit prefix|prefixed]] as convenient, to e.g. [[kilowatt]] (kW), [[megawatt]] (MW) and [[gigawatt]] (GW). Because power output for variable renewable sources is unpredictable, however, using nameplate capacity as a metric significantly overstates a source's average generation. Thus, capacity is typically multiplied by a suitable [[capacity factor]], which takes into account varying conditions - weather, nighttime, latitude, maintenance, etc. to give energy planners an idea of a source's value to the public. In addition, depending on context, the stated peak power may be prior to a subsequent conversion to [[alternating current]], e.g. for a single photovoltaic panel, or include this conversion and its loss for a grid connected [[photovoltaic power station]].&lt;ref name="epia-2014" /&gt;{{rp|15}}&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-snapshot-1992-2013" /&gt;{{rp|10}} Worldwide, the average solar PV capacity factor is 11%.&lt;ref name="eia-cf" /&gt;

[[Wind power]] has different characteristics, e.g. a higher [[capacity factor]] and about four times the 2015 electricity production of solar power. Compared with wind power, photovoltaic power production correlates well with power consumption for air-conditioning in warm countries. {{Asof|2017}} a handful of utilities have started combining PV installations with battery banks, thus obtaining several hours of [[dispatchable generation]] to help mitigate problems associated with the [[duck curve]] after sunset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.treehugger.com/energy-policy/tesla-kills-duck-big-batteries.html |work= [[TreeHugger]] |title= Tesla kills the duck with big batteries |first= Lloyd |last= Alter |date= 2017-01-31 |accessdate= 2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/08/tesla-battery-packs-power-the-hawaiian-island-of-kauai-after-dark.html |website= [[CNBC|cnbc.com]] |title= Tesla battery packs power the Hawaiian island of Kauai after dark |first= Phil |last= LeBeau |date= 2017-03-08 |accessdate= 2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worldwide ===

In 2017, photovoltaic capacity increased by 95&amp;nbsp;GW, with a 34% growth year-on-year of new installations. Cumulative installed capacity exceeded 401&amp;nbsp;GW by the end of the year, sufficient to supply 2.1 percent of the world's total [[electricity consumption]].&lt;ref name="IEA-PVPS-2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA-PVPS_-_A_Snapshot_of_Global_PV_-_1992-2016__1_.pdf|title=Snapshot of Global Photovoltaic Markets 2017|date=19 April 2017 |accessdate=11 July 2017 |format=PDF |work=report |publisher=International Energy Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of leading countries==
{{see also|Timeline of solar cells}}
Since the 1950s, when the first solar cells were commercially manufactured, there has been a succession of countries leading the world as the largest producer of electricity from solar photovoltaics. First it was the United States, then Japan, followed by Germany, and currently China.

=== United States (1954–1996) ===

The [[Solar power in the United States|United States]], where modern solar PV was invented, led installed capacity for many years. Based on preceding work by Swedish and German engineers, the American engineer [[Russell Ohl]] at [[Bell Labs]] patented the first modern solar cell in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=2402662.PN.&amp;OS=PN/2402662&amp;RS=PN/2402662 United States Patent and Trademark Office – Database]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41 |title=Magic Plates, Tap Sun For Power|publisher=Popular Science |date=June 1931|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also there at Bell Labs where the first practical [[Crystalline silicon|c-silicon]] cell was developed in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200904/physicshistory.cfm|title=Bell Labs Demonstrates the First Practical Silicon Solar Cell|work=aps.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jap/25/5/10.1063/1.1721711|title=Journal of Applied Physics — A New Silicon p–n Junction Photocell for Converting Solar Radiation into Electrical Power|author=D. M. Chapin-C. S. Fuller-G. L. Pearson|work=aip.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hoffman Electronics]], the leading manufacturer of silicon solar cells in the 1950s and 1960s, improved on the cell's efficiency, produced solar radios, and equipped [[Vanguard&amp;nbsp;I]], the first [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar powered satellite]] launched into orbit in 1958.

In 1977 US-President [[Jimmy Carter]] installed [[solar hot water panel]]s on the White House promoting [[solar energy]]&lt;ref name="whitehouse-panels"&gt;{{cite web |author=Biello David |title=Where Did the Carter White House's Solar Panels Go? |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/carter-white-house-solar-panel-array/ |website=Scientific American |accessdate=31 July 2014 |date=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]], originally named ''Solar Energy Research Institute'' was established at Golden, Colorado. In the 1980s and early 1990s, most photovoltaic modules were used in [[stand-alone power system]]s or powered consumer products such as [[Solar-powered watch|watches]], [[Solar-powered calculator|calculators]] and toys, but from around 1995, industry efforts have focused increasingly on developing grid-connected [[rooftop PV system]]s and [[Photovoltaic power station|power stations]]. By 1996, solar PV capacity in the US amounted to 77&amp;nbsp;megawatts–more than any other country in the world at the time. Then, Japan moved ahead.

=== Japan (1997–2004) ===

[[Solar power in Japan|Japan]] took the lead as the world's largest producer of PV electricity, after the city of Kobe was hit by the [[Great Hanshin earthquake]] in 1995. Kobe experienced severe power outages in the aftermath of the earthquake, and [[PV systems]] were then considered as a temporary supplier of power during such events, as the disruption of the [[electric grid]] paralyzed the entire infrastructure, including gas stations that depended on electricity to pump gasoline. Moreover, in December of that same year, an accident occurred at the multibillion-dollar experimental [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant]]. A sodium leak caused a major fire and forced a shutdown (classified as [[International Nuclear Event Scale|INES]] 1). There was massive public outrage when it was revealed that the semigovernmental agency in charge of Monju had tried to cover up the extent of the accident and resulting damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=REACTOR ACCIDENT IN JAPAN IMPERILS ENERGY PROGRAM| first=Andrew | last=Pollack | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/24/world/reactor-accident-in-japan-imperils-energy-program.html| work=New York Times| date=24 February 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;wise-paris.org [http://www.wise-paris.org/index.html?/english/ournewsletter/2/page7.html&amp;/english/frame/menu.html&amp;/english/frame/band.html Sodium Leak and Fire at Monju]&lt;/ref&gt; Japan remained world leader in photovoltaics until 2004, when its capacity amounted to 1,132&amp;nbsp;megawatts. Then, focus on PV deployment shifted to Europe.

=== Germany (2005–2014) ===

In 2005, [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]] took the lead from Japan. With the introduction of the [[German Renewable Energy Act|Renewable Energy Act]] in 2000, [[feed-in tariffs]] were adopted as a policy mechanism. This policy established that renewables have priority on the grid, and that a fixed price must be paid for the produced electricity over a 20-year period, providing a guaranteed return on investment irrespective of actual market prices. As a consequence, a high level of investment security lead to a soaring number of new photovoltaic installations that peaked in 2011, while investment costs in renewable technologies were brought down considerably. In 2016 Germany's installed PV capacity was over the 40&amp;nbsp;GW mark.

=== China (2015–present) ===

China surpassed Germany's capacity by the end of 2015, becoming the world's largest producer of photovoltaic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cleantechnica.com/2016/01/22/china-overtakes-germany-become-worlds-leading-solar-pv-country/|title= China Overtakes Germany To Become World’s Leading Solar PV Country|first= Joshua|last=S Hill |date= January 22, 2016|accessdate= August 16, 2016|work= Clean Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar power in China|China]]'s rapid PV growth continued in 2016 – with 34.2&amp;nbsp;GW of solar photovoltaics installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/current/2017/kw03/nea-china-added-3424-gw-of-solar-pv-capacity-in-2016.html|title=NEA: China added 34.24 GW of solar PV capacity in 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=www.solarserver.com|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-renewables-tariffs-idUSKBN0U703Y20151224 quickly lowering feed in tariff rates] at the end of 2015 motivated many developers to secure tariff rates before mid-year 2016 – as they were anticipating further cuts ([http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2016/10/china-to-lower-feed-in-tariff-cut-subsidies-for-solar-pv-systems.html correctly so]). During the course of the year, China announced its goal of installing 100&amp;nbsp;GW during the next [[Five-year plans of China|Chinese Five Year Economic Plan]] (2016–2020). China expected to spend ¥1 trillion ($145B) on solar construction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-energy-renewables-idUSKBN14P06P|title=China to plow $361 billion into renewable fuel by 2020|date=2017-01-05|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; during that period.

The average [[price per watt]] dropped drastically for solar cells in the decades leading up to 2017. While in 1977 prices for [[crystalline silicon]] cells were about $77 per watt, average spot prices in August 2018 were as low as $0.13 per watt or nearly 600 times less than forty years ago. Prices for [[thin-film solar cell]]s and for c-Si [[solar panel]]s were around $.60 per watt.&lt;ref name="energytrend-pv-spotprice"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Module and cell prices declined even further after 2014 ''(see price quotes in table)''.

This price trend was seen as evidence supporting [[Swanson's law]] (an observation similar to the famous [[Moore's Law]]) that states that the per-watt cost of solar cells and panels fall by 20 percent for every doubling of cumulative photovoltaic production.&lt;ref name="Econ1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/21566414-alternative-energy-will-no-longer-be-alternative-sunny-uplands |title=Sunny Uplands: Alternative energy will no longer be alternative |work=[[The Economist]] |accessdate =2012-12-28 |date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study showed price/kWh dropping by 10% per year since 1980, and predicted that solar could contribute 20% of total electricity consumption by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699 |title=How predictable is technological progress? |publisher= |doi=10.1016/j.respol.2015.11.001 |author= J.

In its 2014 edition of the ''Technology Roadmap: Solar Photovoltaic Energy'' report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) published prices for residential, commercial and utility-scale [[PV system]]s for eight major markets as of 2013 ''(see table below)''.&lt;ref name="IEA-roadmap-PV-2014" /&gt; However, DOE's [[SVTC Technologies#The SunShot Initiative|SunShot Initiative]] report states lower prices than the IEA report, although both reports were published at the same time and referred to the same period. After 2014 prices fell further. For 2014, the SunShot Initiative modeled U.S. system prices to be in the range of $1.80 to $3.29 per watt.&lt;ref name="sunshot-2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/62558.pdf |title=Photovoltaic System Pricing Trends – Historical, Recent, and Near-Term Projections, 2014 Edition |work=NREL |page=4 |date=22 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XOoaSCpl |archivedate=29 March 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources identified similar price ranges of $1.70 to $3.50 for the different market segments in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=GreenTechMedia |url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-system-prices-continue-to-fall-during-a-record-breaking-2014 |title=Solar PV Pricing Continues to Fall During a Record-Breaking 2014 |date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the highly penetrated German market, prices for residential and small commercial rooftop systems of up to 100&amp;nbsp;kW declined to $1.36 per watt (€1.24/W) by the end of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photovoltaik-guide.de/pv-preisindex |title=Photovoltaik-Preisindex |trans-title=Solar PV price index |work=PhotovoltaikGuide |quote=Turnkey net-prices for a solar PV system of up to 100 kWp amounted to Euro 1,240 per kWp. |access-date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Deutsche Bank estimated costs for small residential rooftop systems in the U.S. around $2.90 per watt.

There were significant advances in conventional [[crystalline silicon]] (c-Si) technology in the years leading up to 2017. The falling cost of the [[polysilicon]] since 2009, that followed after a period of severe shortage ''(see below)'' of silicon feedstock, pressure increased on manufacturers of commercial [[thin film solar cell|thin-film PV technologies]], including amorphous thin-film silicon (a-Si), cadmium telluride (CdTe), and copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), lead to the bankruptcy of several thin-film companies that had once been highly touted.&lt;ref&gt;RenewableEnergyWorld.com [http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/01/how-thin-film-solar-fares-vs-crystalline-silicon How thin film solar fares vs crystalline silicon], 3 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The sector faced price competition from Chinese crystalline silicon cell and module manufacturers, and some companies together with their patents were sold below cost.&lt;ref name=NYT01913&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese Firm Buys U.S. Solar Start-Up|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/business/energy-environment/chinese-company-buys-2-solar-companies-from-west.html|accessdate=January 10, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 9, 2013|author=Diane Cardwell|author2=Keith Bradsher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 thin-film technologies accounted for about 9 percent of worldwide deployment, while 91 percent was held by crystalline silicon ([[mono-Si]] and [[multi-Si]]). With 5 percent of the overall market, CdTe held more than half of the thin-film market, leaving 2 percent to each CIGS and amorphous silicon.&lt;ref name="Fraunhofer-PR-2014"&gt;{{cite web

*[[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cell|CIGS technology]]
:Copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) is the name of the semiconductor material on which the technology is based. One of the largest [[List of CIGS companies|producers of CIGS photovoltaics]] in 2015 was the Japanese company [[Solar Frontier]] with a manufacturing capacity in the gigawatt-scale. Their CIS line technology included modules with [[solar cell efficiency|conversion efficiencies]] of over 15%.&lt;ref name="solar-frontier-apr-2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solar-frontier.com/eng/news/2015/C044372.html |title=Solar Frontier Completes Construction of the Tohoku Plant |work=Solar Frontier |date=2 April 2015 |access-date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company profited from the booming Japanese market and attempted to expand its international business. However, several prominent manufacturers could not keep up with the advances in conventional crystalline silicon technology. The company [[Solyndra]] ceased all business activity and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2011, and [[Nanosolar]], also a CIGS manufacturer, closed its doors in 2013. Although both companies produced CIGS solar cells, it has been pointed out, that the failure was not due to the technology but rather because of the companies themselves, using a flawed architecture, such as, for example, Solyndra's cylindrical substrates.&lt;ref name="spw-cigs-simplified"&gt;

=== Silicon shortage (2005–2008) ===

[[File:Polysilicon prices history since 2004.svg|thumb|[[Polysilicon]] prices since 2004. As of October 2018, the [[Average selling price|ASP]] for polysilicon stands at $9.802/kg&lt;ref name="energytrend-pricequotes" /&gt;]]

In the early 2000s, prices for [[polysilicon]], the raw material for conventional solar cells, were as low as $30 per kilogram and silicon manufacturers had no incentive to expand production.

However, there was a severe silicon shortage in 2005, when governmental programmes caused a 75% increase in the deployment of solar PV in Europe. In addition, the demand for silicon from semiconductor manufacturers was growing. Since the amount of silicon needed for semiconductors makes up a much smaller portion of production costs, semiconductor manufacturers were able to outbid solar companies for the available silicon in the market.&lt;ref&gt;Wired.com [http://archive.wired.com/science/planetearth/news/2005/03/67013 Silicon Shortage Stalls Solar] 28 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the incumbent polysilicon producers were slow to respond to rising demand for solar 
applications, because of their painful experience with over-investment in the past. Silicon prices sharply rose to about $80 per kilogram, and reached as much as $400/kg for long-term contracts and spot prices. In 2007, the constraints on silicon became so severe that the solar industry was forced to idle about a quarter of its cell and module manufacturing capacity—an estimated 777&amp;nbsp;MW of the then available production capacity. The shortage also provided silicon specialists with both the cash and an incentive to develop new technologies and several new producers entered the market. Early responses from the solar industry focused on improvements in the recycling of silicon. When this potential was exhausted, companies have been taking a harder look at alternatives to the conventional [[Siemens process]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it takes about three years to build a new polysilicon plant, the shortage continued until 2008. Prices for conventional solar cells remained constant or even rose slightly during the period of silicon shortage from 2005 to 2008. This is notably seen as a "shoulder" that sticks out in the [[commons:File:Swansons-law.png|Swanson's PV-learning curve]] and it was feared that a prolonged shortage could delay solar power becoming competitive with conventional energy prices without subsidies.

In the meantime the solar industry lowered the number of grams-per-watt by reducing wafer thickness and kerf loss, increasing yields in each manufacturing step, reducing module loss, and raising panel efficiency. Finally, the ramp up of polysilicon production alleviated worldwide markets from the scarcity of silicon in 2009 and subsequently lead to an overcapacity with sharply declining prices in the photovoltaic industry for the following years.

}}

As the [[Polycrystalline silicon#Manufacturers|polysilicon]] industry had started to build additional large production capacities during the shortage period, prices dropped as low as $15 per kilogram forcing some producers to suspend production or exit the sector. Prices for silicon stabilized around $20 per kilogram and the booming solar PV market helped to reduce the enormous global overcapacity from 2009 onwards. However, overcapacity in the PV industry continued to persist. In 2013, global record deployment of 38&amp;nbsp;GW (updated EPIA figure&lt;ref name="epia-2014" /&gt;) was still much lower than China's annual production capacity of approximately 60&amp;nbsp;GW. Continued overcapacity was further reduced by significantly lowering [[solar module]] prices and, as a consequence, many manufacturers could no longer cover costs or remain competitive. As worldwide growth of PV deployment continued, the gap between overcapacity and global demand was expected in 2014 to close in the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;

IEA-PVPS published in 2014 historical data for the worldwide utilization of solar PV module production capacity that showed a slow return to normalization in manufacture in the years leading up to 2014. The utilization rate is the ratio of production capacities versus actual production output for a given year. A low of 49% was reached in 2007 and reflected the peak of the silicon shortage that idled a significant share of the module production capacity. As of 2013, the utilization rate had recovered somewhat and increased to 63%.&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-trends-2014" /&gt;{{rp|47}}

== History of deployment ==

Deployment figures on a global, regional and nationwide scale are well documented since the early 1990s. While worldwide photovoltaic capacity grew continuously, deployment figures by country were much more dynamic, as they depended strongly on national policies. A number of organizations release comprehensive reports on PV deployment on a yearly basis. They include annual and cumulative deployed PV [[nameplate capacity|capacity]], typically given in [[watt-peak]], a break-down by markets, as well as in-depth analysis and forecasts about future trends.

=== Worldwide cumulative ===

[[File:PV cume semi log chart 2014 estimate.svg|thumb|Worldwide cumulative PV capacity on a semi log chart since 1992]]

Worldwide growth of solar PV capacity was an exponential curve between 1992 and 2017. Tables below show global cumulative nominal capacity by the end of each year in [[megawatts]], and the year-to-year increase in percent. In 2014, global capacity was expected to grow by 33 percent from 139 to 185 GW. This corresponded to an exponential growth rate of 29 percent or about 2.4 years for current worldwide PV capacity to [[Doubling time|double]]. Exponential growth rate: P(t) = P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;rt&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is 139&amp;nbsp;GW, growth-rate ''r'' 0.29 (results in [[doubling time]] ''t'' of 2.4 years).

The following table contains data from multiple different sources.

'''Irma M. Wyman''' (January 31, 1928 - November 17, 2015) was an early computer engineer and the first woman to become vice president of Honeywell, Inc. She was a [[systems thinking]] tutor and was the first female [[Chief Information Officer|CIO]] of [[Honeywell]].

==Academic life==
In 1945, Wyman received a Regents Scholarship and was accepted into the College of Engineering at the [[University of Michigan]] as one of seven female students. To supplement her scholarship, she worked as a switchboard operator and waitress.

At the time, women in engineering programs received little encouragement and support. While her grades qualified her for membership in [[Tau Beta Pi]], the engineering honor society, she received only a "Women's Badge", since the society did not admit women at the time. Wyman graduated with a Bachelor of Science/EM degree in 1949.

==Career==

===Computing Future Thought Leadership===
While still a junior in college, Wyman worked on a missile guidance project at the [[Willow Run Research Center]].  To calculate trajectory, they used mechanical calculators.  She visited the [http://www.navsea.navy.mil/Home/Warfare-Centers/NSWC-Dahlgren/ U.S. Naval Proving Ground] where [[Grace Hopper]] was working on similar problems and discovered they were using a prototype of a programmable [[Harvard_Mark_II|Mark II]] computer developed at [[Harvard University]]. She became interested in computers and later recalled that "I became an enthusiastic pioneer in this new technology and it led to my life's career."

After graduation, she joined a [[Women in computing|start-up company]] that was eventually acquired by [[Honeywell Information Systems]]. She moved to [[Minneapolis]] and began a long management career at Honeywell, eventually serving as [[Chief Information Officer]]. She became vice president of [[Honeywell]] '''Corporate Information Management (CIM)''' before retiring in 1990.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | title= Irma Wyman (1928-) | work= Women in the History of Computing Technology | url= http://www.cssu-bg.org/WomeninCS/irma_wyman.php | accessdate= 2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyman then began a second career as archdeacon in the [[Minnesota]] [[Diocese]] of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] where she coached [[servant leadership]], retiring again after ten years as Archdeacon of the Diocese of Minnesota.

Wyman supported research and planning as a [[thought leader]] in [[futures studies]]. As an aside to this, she contended to an interviewer in 1979, that
:''it's just as important to know when to ignore all the careful planning and seize an opportunity.''

Wyman endowed the Irma M. Wyman Scholarship at the University of Michigan's Center for the Education of Women to support women in engineering, computer science and related fields.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Irma's persistent advocacy for women in computer science reflects those of her early career mentor:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12206">'''Jetronic''' is a trade name of a [[fuel injection]] technology for automotive [[petrol engine]]s, developed and marketed by [[Robert Bosch GmbH]] from the 1960s onwards. Bosch licensed the concept to many [[automotive industry|automobile manufacturers]]. There are several variations of the technology offering technological development and refinement.

=={{anchor|D}}D-Jetronic (1967–1979)==
Analog fuel injection, 'D' is from {{lang-de|"Druck"}} meaning pressure. Inlet manifold depression ([[vacuum]]) is measured using a pressure sensor located in, or connected to the [[intake manifold]], in order to calculate the duration of fuel injection pulses. Originally, this system was called Jetronic, but the name D-Jetronic was later created as a [[retronym]] to distinguish it from newer versions.

D-Jetronic was a precursor of modern common rail systems as it had constant pressure fuel delivery to the injectors and pulsed injections, albeit grouped (2 groups of injectors pulsed together) rather than sequential (individual injector pulses) as on later systems.

D-Jetronic used [[Analogue electronics|analogue]] circuitry, with no [[microprocessor]] nor [[Logic gate|digital logic]], the [[Electronic control unit|ECU]] utilised about 25 [[Transistor|transistors]] to perform all of the processing.  The lack of processing power and the unavailability of solid-state sensors meant that the vacuum sensor was a rather expensive precision instrument, rather like a [[barometer]], with brass bellows inside to measure the manifold pressure.  

Although conceptually similar to most later systems with individual electrically controlled injectors per cylinder, and [[Pulse-width modulation|pulse-width modulated]] fuel delivery, the fuel pressure was not modulated by manifold pressure, and the injectors were fired only once per 2 revolutions on the engine (with half of the injectors being fired each revolution).

The system was last used (with a [[Lucas Industries|Lucas]] designed timing mechanism and Lucas labels super-imposed on some components) on the Jaguar V12 engine ([[Jaguar XJ|XJ12]] and [[Jaguar XJS|XJ-S]]) from 1975 until 1979.

=={{anchor|K}}K-Jetronic (1973–1994)==
Mechanical fuel injection, 'K' stands for {{lang-de|"Kontinuierlich"}}, meaning ''continuous''. Commonly called 'Continuous Injection System (CIS) in the USA. K-Jetronic is different from pulsed injection systems in that the fuel flows continuously from all injectors, while the [[fuel pump]] pressurises the fuel up to approximately 5&amp;nbsp;[[bar (unit)|bar]] (73.5&amp;nbsp;[[pounds per square inch|psi]]). The volume of air taken in by the engine is measured to determine the amount of fuel to inject. This system has no [[oxygen sensor|lambda]] loop or lambda control. K-Jetronic debuted in the 1973.5 [[Porsche 911]]T in January 1973, and was later installed into a number of [[Porsche]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Audi]], [[BMW]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls-Royce]], [[Bentley]], [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]], [[Ferrari]], [[Peugeot|Nissan, Peugeot]], [[Renault]], [[Volvo]], [[Saab Automobile|Saab]], [[DeLorean Motor Company|DeLorean]], [[TVR]] and [[Ford]] automobiles. The final car to use K-Jetronic was the 1994 Porsche 911 Turbo 3.6.

Fuel is pumped from the tank to a large control valve called a ''fuel distributor'', which divides the single fuel supply line from the tank into smaller lines, one for each injector. The fuel distributor is mounted atop a control vane through which all intake air must pass, and the system works by varying fuel volume supplied to the injectors based on the angle of the air vane in the [[air flow meter]], which in turn is determined by the volume of air passing the vane, and by the control pressure. The control pressure is regulated with a mechanical device called the control pressure regulator (CPR) or the warm-up regulator (WUR). Depending on the model, the CPR may be used to compensate for altitude, full load, and/or a cold engine. The injectors are simple spring-loaded check valves with nozzles; once fuel system pressure becomes high enough to overcome the counterspring, the injectors begin spraying.

=={{anchor|KL}}K-Jetronic (Lambda)==
First introduced in the [[Volvo 240|Volvo 265]] in 1976. A variant of [[Jetronic#K-Jetronic .281973.E2.80.931994.29|K-Jetronic]] with [[Control theory|closed-loop]] [[Air–fuel ratio#Air.E2.80.93fuel equivalence ratio .28.CE.BB.29|lambda]] control, also named Ku-Jetronic, the letter u denominating USA. The system was developed to comply with [[United States|U.S.A.]] [[Federated state|state]] of [[California|California's]] [[California Air Resources Board]] exhaust emission regulations, and later replaced by [[Jetronic#KE-Jetronic .281985.E2.80.931993.29|KE-Jetronic]].

=={{anchor|KE}}KE-Jetronic (1985–1993)==
Electronically controlled mechanical fuel injection. The [[engine control unit]] (ECU) may be either analog or digital, and the system may or may not have closed-loop lambda control. The system is based on the K-Jetronic mechanical system, with the addition of an electro-hydraulic actuator, essentially a fuel injector inline with the fuel return. Instead of injecting fuel into the intake, this injector allows fuel to bypass the fuel distributor, which varies the fuel pressure supplied to the mechanical injection components based on several inputs (engine speed, air pressure, coolant temperature, throttle position, lambda etc.) via the ECU. With the electronics disconnected, this system will operate as a K-Jetronic system.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bosch GmbH (1985). Electronically Controlled Gasoline Fuel-Injected System with Lambda Closed-Loop Control - KE-Jetronic.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly known as 'CIS-E' in the USA. The later KE3 (CIS-E III) variant features [[engine knocking|knock]] sensing capabilities.

=={{anchor|L}}L-Jetronic (1974–1989)==
Analog fuel injection. L-Jetronic was often called Air-Flow Controlled (AFC) injection to further separate it from the pressure-controlled D-Jetronic &amp;mdash; with the 'L' in its name derived from {{lang-de|luft}}, meaning 'air'. In the system, air flow into the engine is measured by a moving vane (indicating engine load) known as the [[volume air flow sensor]] (VAF) &amp;mdash; referred to in German documentation as the ''LuftMengenMesser'' or LMM. L-Jetronic used custom-designed [[integrated circuits]], resulting in a simpler and more reliable [[engine control unit]] (ECU) than the D-Jetronic's.&lt;ref&gt;Baggeroer, Artgur B. L-Jetronic fuel injection. July 1985. General OneFile. Web. 23 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

L-Jetronic was used heavily in 1980s-era [[Europe]]an cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lee Thompson, John De Armond|title=L-Jetronic|url=http://yarchive.net/car/l-jetronic.html|format=archived [[usenet]] message|date=22 June 1993|accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[BMW K100|BMW K-Series]] motorcycles. Licensing some of Bosch's L-Jetronic concepts and technologies, [[Lucas Automotive|Lucas]], [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi Automotive Products]], [[DENSO|NipponDenso]], and others produced similar fuel injection systems for Asian car manufacturers. L-Jetronic manufactured under license by [[JECS|Japan Electronic Control Systems]] was fitted to the [[Kawasaki_Kz1000|1980 Kawasaki Z1000-H1]], the world's first production fuel injected motorcycle. Despite physical similarity between L-Jetronic components and those produced under license by other manufacturers, the non-Bosch systems should not be called L-Jetronic, and the parts are usually incompatible.

=={{anchor|LE}}LE1-Jetronic, LE2-Jetronic, LE3-Jetronic (1981–1991)==
This is a simplified and more modern variant of [[#L|L-Jetronic]]. The ECU was much cheaper to produce due to more modern components, and was more standardised than the L-Jetronic ECUs. As per L-Jetronic, a vane-type airflow sensor is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LE-Jetronic|url=http://br.bosch-automotive.com/en/internet/parts/parts_and_accessories_2/motor_and_sytems/benzin/injection_system/le_jetronic_1/le_jetronic.html|website=www.bosch-automotive.com|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with L-Jetronic, the fuel injectors used by LE-Jetronic have a higher impedance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Opel fuel injection systems|url=http://users.telenet.be/jov/opeltuners/aboutfi/ciccosinjection.html|website=www.users.telenet.be|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three variants of LE-Jetronic exist: LE1, the initial version. LE2 (1984–), featured cold start functionality integrated in the ECU, which does not require the cold start injector and thermo time switch used by older systems. LE3 (1989–), featuring miniaturised ECU with hybrid technology, integrated into the junction box of the mass airflow meter.

=={{anchor|LU}}LU1-Jetronic, LU2-Jetronic (1983–1991)==
The same as [[#LE|LE1-Jetronic]] and [[#LE|LE2-Jetronic]] respectively, but with closed-loop lambda control. Initially designed for the US market.

=={{anchor|LH}}LH-Jetronic (1982–1998)==
Digital fuel injection, introduced for California bound 1982 [[Volvo 240]] models. The 'LH' stands for {{lang-de|"Luftmasse-Hitzdraht"}} - the [[anemometer#Hot-wire anemometers|hotwire anemometer]] technology used to determine the [[mass]] of air into the engine. This [[mass flow sensor|air mass meter]] is called HLM2 (''Hitzdraht-LuftMassenmesser'' 2) by Bosch. The LH-Jetronic was mostly used by [[Scandinavia]]n car manufacturers, and by sports and luxury cars produced in small quantities, such as [[Porsche 928]]. The most common variants are LH&amp;nbsp;2.2, which uses an [[Intel]] 8049 ([[Intel MCS-48|MCS-48]]) microcontroller, and usually a 4&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]] programme memory, and LH&amp;nbsp;2.4, which uses a [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] 80535 microcontroller (a variant of Intel's 8051/[[Intel MCS-51|MCS-51]] architecture) and 32&amp;nbsp;kB programme memory based on the 27C256 chip. LH-Jetronic&amp;nbsp;2.4 has adaptive lambda control, and support for a variety of advanced features; including fuel enrichment based on [[exhaust gas]] temperature (ex. [[Volvo Redblock Engine|Volvo B204GT/B204FT engines]]). Some later (post-1995) versions contain hardware support for first generation diagnostics according to [[list of ISO standards#ISO 1000–ISO 9999|ISO 9141]] (a.k.a. [[on-board diagnostics#OBD-II|OBD-II]]) and immobiliser functions. {{citation needed|reason=Volvo 940 from 1995 and on was given as an example of this, but model year -95 has the older diagnosis box in the engine compartment, and while 1996–1998 do have an OBD-II style connector, they still use the older interface, not OBD-II.|date=May 2012}}

=={{anchor|Mono}}Mono-Jetronic (1988–1995)==
Digital fuel injection. This system features one centrally positioned fuel injection nozzle. In the US, this kind of [[fuel injection#Throttle body injection|single-point]] injection was marketed as 'throttle body injection' (TBI, by GM), or 'central fuel injection' (CFI, by Ford).

Mono-Jetronic is different from all other known single-point systems, in that it only relies on a throttle position sensor for judging the engine load. There are no sensors for air flow, or intake manifold vacuum. Mono-Jetronic always had adaptive closed-loop lambda control, and due to the simple engine load sensing, it is heavily dependent on the lambda sensor for correct functioning.

The ECU uses an [[Intel MCS-51|Intel 8051]] [[microcontroller]], usually with 16&amp;nbsp;kiB of program memory and without advanced [[on-board diagnostics]] (OBD-II became a requirement in model-year 1996.)

==History==
Before LabLynx was a company, it was a LIMS product offered by Atlanta Systems Consultants, Inc. (ASC).&lt;ref name="LLX_archive1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lablynx.com/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990125100717/http://www.lablynx.com/ |title=LABLynx On The Web |archivedate=25 January 1998 |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doh_fl"&gt;{{cite web |title=Infinity |url=http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Irm/Apps/ihis/JADS/deh/Market%20Research/Background/asc_website.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040831183340/http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Irm/Apps/ihis/JADS/deh/Market%20Research/background/asc_website.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Florida Department of Health |date=8 March 2000 |accessdate=29 December 2015 |archivedate=31 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 1992,&lt;ref name="SoS_asc" /&gt; ASC’s LabLynx division later began work on a laboratory information management system designed specifically for a [[web browser]]. ASC demonstrated its new [[Internet Explorer]]-based LabLynx LIMS at [[Pittsburgh Conference on Analytical Chemistry and Applied Spectroscopy|Pittcon]] in 1997, among the first browser-based LIMS to appear at the time.&lt;ref name="LS_prod"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LIMSwb"&gt;{{cite book |title=LIMS Workbook - A Practical Guide |edition=3rd |author=McGinnis, Mike and Norman Perkins |chapter=I. Wireless LANs |year=2003 |pages=I-16 |publisher=Q2marketsite, Inc |asin=B00161Y71K}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company again showcased LabLynx at Pittcon in 1998&lt;ref name="LS_pitt98"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.limsource.com/calendar/pitt98.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980529121944/http://www.limsource.com/calendar/pitt98.html |archivedate=29 May 1998 |title=LIMSource: Calendar: Pittcon ’98 Preview |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon after picked up a major LIMS-based contract with the [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs Service]].&lt;ref name="FBO"&gt;{{cite web |title=70 -- Laboratory Information Management Software (LIMS) (07/30/98) |url=http://www.fbodaily.com/cbd/archive/1998/07(July)/30-Jul-1998/70awd003.htm|publisher=FedBizOpps|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2400 Lake Park Drive, Smyrna, Georgia.jpg|thumb|250px|LabLynx home office]]

By July 2000, the LabLynx division of ASC separated to become its own incorporated entity.&lt;ref name="SoS_llx" /&gt; And while ASC eventually ceased to exist in 2005,&lt;ref name="SoS_asc" /&gt; LabLynx, Inc. went on to diversify its offerings. The LabLynx’s browser-based LIMS previously demonstrated at Pittcon in 1997 expanded to become ELab, which in 2001 took on an [[application service provider]] (ASP) model of distribution.&lt;ref name="LS_prod2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.limsource.com/products/vatlanta.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010409200118/http://www.limsource.com/products/vatlanta.html |archivedate=9 April 2001 |title=LIMSource: LIMS Vendor: Atlanta Systems Consultants, Inc. |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 LabLynx released a browser-based tool called openLIMS, which gave consultants and end-users the ability "to build custom LIMS solutions that are geared to the exact operational needs of many different laboratories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laboratorytalk.com/news/lbl/lbl100.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419143618/http://www.laboratorytalk.com/news/lbl/lbl100.html |title=Build your own LIMS: News from LabLynx |work=LaboratoryTalk.com |publisher=Pro-Talk Ltd |date=6 January 2004 |accessdate=29 December 2015 |archivedate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 2006, LabLynx established the Laboratory Informatics Institute, an open membership group with the purpose of advancing the field of laboratory informatics and shaping the standards associated with it.&lt;ref name="LII"&gt;{{cite web|title=Laboratory Informatics Institute Established |url=http://www.limsfinder.com/BlogDetail.aspx?id=31049_0_3_0_C |publisher=Laboratory Informatics Institute, Inc. |date=17 July 2006 |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, LabLynx was involved in an initiative to standardize and structure the transmission of laboratory data that first originates in a LIMS or LIS and then moves to a person's or population of people's [[electronic health record]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Laboratory Results Interface (LRI) Pilots Guide |edition= v0.9.4.093011 |author=Clarke, Ann | year=2011 |pages=1–2 |publisher=LabLynx/mdDigest |url= http://wiki.siframework.org/file/view/LRI_Pilots_Guide_Draft_v0_9_4_093011.docx}}&lt;/ref&gt; This laboratory results interface (LRI) pilot began in August 2011 and included collaborations with the supported open source project mdDigest and the U.S. [[Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology]] (ONC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PROJECT BRIEF: LabLynx/mdDigest Pilot |url=http://wiki.siframework.org/LabLynx+Pilot+Brief |publisher= LabLynx/mdDigest |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, LabLynx released HealthCloudPOL, a cloud-based [[laboratory information system]] (LIS) for the physician office laboratory (POL).&lt;ref name="HCPOL_LinkedIn"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/lablynx-inc./comments?topic=5979788253375520768&amp;type=U&amp;scope=209217&amp;stype=C&amp;a=NHFX |title=Security, Reliability, and Regulatory Compliance: healthcloudpol.com |author=LabLynx, Inc |publisher=LinkedIn Corporation |date=February 2015 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lever Bank Bleach Works''' was a [[Bleachfield|Bleach Works]] at Ladyshore, near [[Little Lever]], [[Bolton]].  The works was owned by Thomas Ridgway &amp; Sons.  Former British [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] would appear to be a direct descendent of this family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= This is Lancashire | work= Blair's family tree has branches in Bolton! | url= http://archive.thisislancashire.co.uk/1997/5/13/828094.html | format= [[HTTP]] | accessdate= 2007-10-30 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://archive.is/20080103072041/http://archive.thisislancashire.co.uk/1997/5/13/828094.html | archivedate= 2008-01-03 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The works was located between the [[Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal]] to the north, and the [[River Irwell]] to the south, in the area known as [[Ladyshore]] in the [[Irwell Valley]].

[[File:Irwell weir.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The weir across the [[River Irwell]].  Water was diverted to the left of this image.]]
[[File:Lever bank bleach works ladyshore.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The cobbled access road to the works, still in excellent condition although slightly overgrown.]]
Accessed from Ladyshore Bridge, over the canal, the cobbled pathway is still very much evident.  Stanchions across the river still stand although the bridge/pipework they supported no longer exists.  A weir was built on the nearby [[River Irwell]] and water diverted through a small channel into a reservoir.  High quality stone walls are still evident along the banks of the river.

The weir collapsed in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Historic weir falls victim to flooding | url = http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/9815740.Historic_weir_falls_victim_to_flooding/ | publisher = [[theboltonnews.co.uk]] | date = 13 July 2012 | accessdate = 6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a '''list of [[Intel]]'s manufacturing and assembly/test sites'''. Processors are manufactured in [[semiconductor fabrication plant]]s ("fabs") which are then sent to [[Assembly line|assembly]] and testing sites before delivery to customers. Approximately 75% of Intel's semiconductor fabrication is performed in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.intel.com/servlet/JiveServlet/download/1882-25-3841/US_Manufacturing.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302101731/http://newsroom.intel.com/servlet/JiveServlet/download/1882-25-3841/US_Manufacturing.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''computer-animated film''' is a [[feature film]] that has been [[computer animation|computer-animated]] to appear [[three-dimensional]]. While traditional [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[animation|animated]] films are now made primarily with the help of [[computer]]s, the technique to [[rendering (computer graphics)|render]] realistic [[3D computer graphics]] (CG) or 3D [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), is unique to computers.

This is a list of theatrically released feature films that are entirely computer-animated.

==Released films==
Release date listed is the ''first'' public theatrical screening of the completed film. This may mean that the dates listed here may ''not'' be representative of when the film came out in your resident country, or when it was [[wide release|widely released]] in the United States.

The country or countries listed reflects the places where the production companies for each title are based. This means that the countries listed for a film might not reflect the location where the film was shot or the countries where the film received a [[theatrical release]]. If a title is a multi-country production, the country listed first corresponds with the production company that had the most significant role in the film's creation.

Many lists exist that provide an overview of large [[software]] [[company|companies]], often called "independent software vendors" ("[[Independent software vendor|ISVs]]"), in the world. The lists differ by [[methodology]] of composition and consequently show substantial differences in both [[Public company|listed companies]] and [[ranking]] of those companies.

== Forbes Global 2000 ==
The [[Forbes Global 2000]] is an annual ranking of the top 2000 [[public companies]] in the world by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, based on a mix of four metrics: [[sales]], [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], [[asset]]s and [[market value]]. The Forbes list for software companies includes only [[pure play]] (or nearly pure play) software companies and excludes manufacturers, consumer electronics companies, conglomerates, [[List of IT consulting firms|IT consulting firms]], and computer services companies even if they have large software divisions. For example, [[IBM]] would likely rank #3 in 2017 if its software business unit had been a separate company. The omission of more diversified firms can be useful to investors who are seeking either more or less exposure in the software sector.

A '''load-bearing wall''' or '''bearing wall''' is a [[wall]] that is an active [[structural element]] of a [[building]], that is, it bears the weight of the elements above said wall, resting upon it by conducting its weight to a [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] structure. The materials most often used to construct load-bearing walls in large buildings are [[concrete]], [[concrete masonry unit|block]], or [[brick]].

[[Structural load|Load]]-bearing walls are one of the earliest forms of construction. The development of the [[flying buttress]] in [[Gothic architecture]] allowed structures to maintain an open interior space, transferring more weight to the buttresses instead of to central bearing walls. The [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] is an example of a load-bearing wall structure with flying buttresses.

In housing, load-bearing walls are most common in the light construction method known as "[[framing (construction)|platform framing]]", and each load-bearing wall sits on a [[wall plate|wall sill plate]] which is mated to the lowest [[wall plate|base plate]]. The birth of the [[skyscraper]] era, the concurrent rise of [[steel]] as a more suitable [[Framing (construction)|framing system]] first designed by [[William Le Baron Jenney]], and the limitations of load-bearing construction in large buildings led to a decline in the use of load-bearing walls in large-scale, commercial structures.

== Description ==
A '''load-bearing wall''' or '''bearing wall''' is a [[wall]] that is an active [[structural element]] of a [[building]], that is, it bears the weight of the elements above said wall, resting upon it by conducting its weight to a [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] structure. The materials most often used to construct load-bearing walls in large buildings are [[concrete]], [[concrete masonry unit|block]], or [[brick]]. By contrast, a [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] provides no significant structural support beyond what is necessary to bear its own materials or conduct such loads to a bearing wall.

== History ==
[[Structural load|Load]]-bearing walls are one of the earliest forms of construction. The development of the [[flying buttress]] in [[Gothic architecture]] allowed structures to maintain an open interior space, transferring more weight to the buttresses instead of to central bearing walls. The [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] is an example of a load-bearing wall structure with flying buttresses.

==Application==
Depending on the type of building and the number of floors, load-bearing walls are gauged to the appropriate thickness to carry the weight above them. Without doing so, it is possible that an outer wall could become unstable if the [[Structural load|load]] exceeds the strength of the material used, potentially leading to the collapse of the structure. The primary function of this wall is to enclose or divide space of the building to make it more functional and useful. It provides privacy, affords security, and gives protection against heat, cold, sun or rain.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

===Housing===
In housing, load-bearing walls are most common in the light construction method known as "[[framing (construction)|platform framing]]", and each load-bearing wall sits on a [[wall plate|wall sill plate]] which is mated to the lowest [[wall plate|base plate]]. The sills are bolted to the [[masonry]] or concrete [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]].

[[File:Parallam support beam.jpg|thumb|A beam of [[Parallel strand lumber|PSL]] lumber installed to replace a load-bearing wall at the first floor of a three-story building.]]

The ''[[top plate]]'' or ''ceiling plate'' is the top of the wall, which sits just below the platform of the next floor (at the ceiling). The ''base plate'' or ''[[floor plate]]'' is the bottom attachment point for the [[wall stud]]s. Using a top plate and a bottom plate, a wall can be constructed while it lies on its side, allowing for end-nailing of the [[Wall stud|studs]] between two plates, and then the finished wall can be tipped up vertically into place atop the wall sill; this not only improves accuracy and shortens construction time, but also produces a stronger wall.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

===Skyscrapers===
Due to the immense weight of [[skyscraper]]s, the base and walls of the lower floors must be extremely strong. [[Piling]]s are used to anchor the building to the [[bedrock]] underground. For example, the [[Burj Khalifa]], the world's tallest building as well as the world's tallest structure, uses specially treated and mixed [[reinforced concrete]]. Over {{convert|45000|m3|cuyd}} of concrete, weighing more than {{convert|110000|t|ST|abbr=on}} were used to construct the concrete and steel foundation, which features 192 piles, with each pile being 1.5&amp;nbsp;m diameter × 43&amp;nbsp;m long ({{convert|1.5|m|ft|disp=output only|abbr=on}} × {{convert|43|m|ft|disp=output only|abbr=on}}) and buried more than {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;lng=3&amp;id=burjdubai-dubai-unitedarabemirates |title=Burj Khalifa, Dubai &amp;#124; 182168 |publisher=Emporis |date= |accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1417">'''Mechanical rebar connections''', also known as '''mechanical splices''', are used to join lengths of [[rebar]] together. Building code requirements for [[masonry]] construction now require longer lap lengths for some bar sizes. [[File:Devoran-rebar-coupler.jpg|thumb|Rebar Coupler]]
These changes mean more congestion in masonry cells and more difficult construction. To alleviate this problem, builders can either use open-cell blocks, which are more expensive, or use mechanical rebar couplers to eliminate the lap.  [[Reinforcing bar]] coupling has all of the features desirable in a rebar joining system combined with unequalled simplicity of installation. Couplers are designed to splice the same diameter bars where one bar is free to move and can be rotated.

Benefits of using a mechanical rebar connection include:
* A self-aligning taper-threaded design provides continuity and structural integrity
* Spliced bars behave as continuous lengths of reinforcing steel bars by providing full strength in tension and compression and stress reversal applications
* Quick and easy to install
* Develops higher tensile strength than lap splicing in [[reinforced concrete]].

'''Mena Grabowski Trott''' (born '''Philomena Frances Grabowski''' on 16 September 1977, now '''Mena Grabowski Lazar''') is a co-founder of [[Six Apart]], creator of [[Movable Type]] and [[TypePad]]. The company name originates from the fact that Trott and co-founder/ex-husband [[Benjamin Trott]] were born six days apart.

Trott was president of Six Apart. She remains on the Board of Directors after the merger which resulted in the formation of Say Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924131436/http://www.dollarshort.org:80/ds/2010/09/farewell-six-apart.html|title=Dollarshort: Farewell, Six Apart.|author=|date=24 September 2010|website=archive.org|accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her first efforts in weblogging at dollarshort.org in 2001.

Movable Type was originally developed by Mena Trott and Benjamin Trott during a period of unemployment in late 2001 for Mena's personal blogging use.

Trott was named one of the People of the Year by [[PC Magazine]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041224220654/http://pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1744148,00.asp|title=Feature from PC Magazine: People of the Year|author=|date=24 December 2004|website=archive.org|accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, she was named a member of the [[TR35|TR100]] by [[MIT]] [[Technology Review]] magazine, as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/04/10/tr100computing1004.asp?p=2|title=TR 100: Computing|first=Neil|last=Savage|date=|website=technologyreview.com|accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mena Trott was operating the blog "The Sew Weekly" at sewweekly.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109182253/http://www.sewweekly.com|title=The Sew Weekly|author=|date=9 January 2010|website=archive.org|accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blog encouraged people to "sew one garment a week".  Each week, Mena developed a theme, such as "tickled pink" (garments made from pink fabric) and "celebrating mothers" (garments which our mothers wore). That blog project appears to have come to an end as of December 2012.

'''Mobile Passport''' is a mobile app that enables travelers entering the United States to submit their passport information and customs declaration form to [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) via smartphone or tablet and go through the inspections process using an expedited lane. Mobile Passport is available to U.S. passport holders and Canadian passport holders with a B1 and B2 visa when entering the United States. 
The app is available on iOS and Android devices and is operational at 24 airports and the [[Port Everglades]] cruise port in [[Fort Lauderdale]], Florida.&lt;ref name="cbp"&gt;https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/mobile-passport-control, “[[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]]”, 18 August 2017. Retrieved on 2 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of Mobile Passport operations have increased threefold from 2016 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbloom, Stephanie. [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/travel/beating-the-lines-at-airports.html “How to Bypass Airport Lines With the Tips of Your Fingers”], “[[The New York Times]]”, New York, 28 Februar 2018. Retrieved on 4 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Mobile Passport app was developed by Airside Mobile, Inc, an organization started by former executives at the [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA), Hans Miller and Adam Tsao. Miller and Tsao partnered with Florian and Christina Scholochow in 2010. 
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/airside-mobile, “[[Crunchbase]]”, Retrieved on 2 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
Mobile Passport operations were launched in [[Atlanta]] at the [[Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport]] in 2016 and are now available at 24 U.S. airports and 1 U.S. cruise port. The Mobile Passport app is authorized by CBP and sponsored by the [[Airports Council International]]-North America, [[Boeing]], and the Port of Everglades.
Airside Mobile, Inc. secured a Series A funding of $6M in the fall of 2017.

== How it works ==
During the customs process at the Federal Inspection Service (FIS) area of a U.S. airport, travelers arriving from international locations typically wait in long lines before presenting passports and paperwork and verbally answering questions made by CBP officials. U.S. passport holders and [[Canada|Canadian]] passport holders with a B1 or B2 visa who have downloaded the Mobile Passport app can expedite this process by submitting information regarding their passport and trip details via their mobile device to CBP officials, then access an expedited line.
The Mobile Passport app can be downloaded from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store on to an iOS or Android device and complete their digital passport profile(s) before they travel. A pre-approval is not required and the app is for free. 
To set up a digital passport profile, travelers may use the document scanner feature within the Mobile Passport app to capture their passport information, and then verify that it is correct. Or, they may manually enter the information directly on the app. The name must appear exactly as it does on the passport. For instance, under Surname, users have to enter their last name. Under Given Names, travelers have to enter their first name [SPACE] middle name [SPACE] middle name, and so on. All hyphens and apostrophes should be replaced by a [SPACE]. To complete the passport profile, users have to touch the box at the bottom of the screen. The camera on the mobile device will open up to allow a “selfie” to be taken of the respective passport holder. According to CBP, group submissions may be made using the Mobile Passport app on one mobile device for all family members of the same household traveling together provided that each family member is a U.S. citizen with a valid U.S. passport or a Canadian citizen with both a valid Canadian passport and B1 or B2 visa status. The Mobile Passport app will not work for [[Permanent residence (United States)|U.S. Legal Permanent Residents]] nor will they be able to process through the designated Mobile Passport lane upon arrival in the United States. 
&lt;ref name="cbp"/&gt;

Upon landing or docking in the United States, and instead of filling out a traditional customs declaration paper form, Mobile Passport users may power up their mobile device, turn on Wi-Fi or data, select all of the passport profiles for their traveling party, and complete the New Trip section on the Mobile Passport app. Within a few moments, CBP will review the submission and send the traveler a digital Encrypted Quick Response (QR) code receipt(s), which expires after four hours. This provides travelers enough time between landing or docking and approaching the FIS area where they may access the designated Mobile Passport lanes. Mobile Passport users will be required to show their physical passport(s) and QR code receipt(s), and briefly talk to a CBP officer.

Retrieved on 2 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Travelers using Mobile Passport may access their mobile devices to use the Mobile Passport app, when processing through the FIS area, but they may not conduct phone calls.
Personal data is encrypted and saved is on the device as a profile and transmitted securely to CBP for review, similar to using an Automated Passport Control kiosk. The Mobile Passport app offers an option to store the user profile on the device or to delete it after the trip. 
Because the Mobile Passport app is used upon entry to the United States, the port of entry is defined as the location where travelers will initially enter the U.S. and undergo screening by CBP. Travelers who would like to use the Mobile Passport app should make sure they are arriving in the U.S. at one of the airports or cruise ports participating with Mobile Passport.

The '''National Engineering Forum''' (NEF) is an American movement based on the idea that the U.S. engineering enterprise fuels national security and economic prosperity, but that the nation’s engineers face a series of challenges threatening their profession’s sustainability. The movement is aimed at finding solutions to those challenges, identified by NEF as the 3C’s - capacity, capability and competitiveness:

* the ''capacity'' of technical talent to fill future jobs 
* the engineering workforce’s ''capability'' to address 21st century challenges, and 
* ''competitiveness'' in a global economy

Currently, NEF spotlights American engineers and the 3C’s via its [http://nationalengineeringforum.com/nef-newsletters/ newsletter] and [http://nationalengineeringforum.com/ website], and acclaims engineering advancements on [https://twitter.com/NatlEngForum Twitter]. 

== History ==
In 2012, Lockheed Martin launched the National Engineering Forum, and then engaged the Council on Competitiveness and the National Academy of Engineering, which share a common vision for transforming the way we perceive, experience, and prioritize engineering in this country. NEF's initial focus included a five-year regional dialogue tour of key engineering hubs throughout the nation, including: New York; Knoxville, Tennessee; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Los Angeles; Columbus, Ohio; Houston; San Diego; Seattle; Detroit; Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina; Pittsburgh; Chicago; Boston; Atlanta; Phoenix; Madison, Wisconsin; Orlando, Florida; Stillwater, Oklahoma and Greenville, South Carolina.

In addition to sharing engineering news and features in its regular newsletter, in 2014 NEF released a report entitled [http://nationalengineeringforum.com/wordpress2/wp-content/uploads/NEF-Report-MID.pdf Engineering our Nation's Future].

The '''National Technical Museum''' ({{lang-cs|Národní technické muzeum}}) ('''NTM''') in [[Prague]] is the largest institution dedicated to preserving information and artifacts related to the history of technology in the [[Czech Republic]]. The museum has large exhibits representing approximately 15% of its total collection. The museum also manages substantial archives consisting of approximately 3,500 linear shelf meters of archival material and about 250,000 books. The [[museum]] was founded in 1908 and has been in its current location (adjacent to [[Letná Park]]) since 1941.

==History==
The collections originate from the professional engineering school (founded in 1717 in Prague), continued by the [[Czech Technical University in Prague|Prague Polytechnical Institute]] (founded in 1806) and finally the opening of the Czech industrial museum, founded by [[Vojtěch Náprstek]] in 1874. Further parts of his collections were transferred to the museum later in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=NTM&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ntm.cz/en/en-muzeum/historie-muzea|title=History of National Technical Museum {{!}} National Technical Museum Prague|date=2012-01-30|website=www.ntm.cz|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The modern origin is the Technical Museum of Bohemia, opened to the public in 1910 in the Schwarzenberg Palace, renamed the Czechoslovakian Technical Museum in 1918 (with the founding of the state of Czechoslovakia) and moved to its present building in 1942.&lt;ref name=NTM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=Paul |last2=Cohen |first2=Brenda |date=2000 |title=Journal of College Science Teaching |jstor=42990702 |journal=Journal of College Science Teaching |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=213–214 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was designed by Milan Babuška, the winner of an architectural competition in [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalist]] style.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt;  The collection moved out during [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Nazi occupation]], then was gradually returned, only fully occupying the main building in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt;

In 1995 three new galleries were opened: Industrial Design, Single Building, and Fine Arts.  Industrial design particularly featured early Czech motorcycles and light fittings, and their processes of manufacture.  The Single Building Gallery is used for quarterly exhibitions of models and designs of buildings which have some topical relevance such as an anniversary.  The Fine Arts gallery features paintings and sculptures from the 17th to 20th century of subjects related to industry, science and technology.&lt;ref name=Janousek&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Janousek |first1=Ivo |last2= |first2= |date=1995 |title=Transformations of the National Technical Museum in Prague: Principles and Practice |url= |journal=Museum Management and Curatorship |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=181–187 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 the museum opened a [[Railroad]] Museum that contains about 100 railway vehicles.

The [[2002 European floods]] caused damage to some 200 cubic metres of documents at the museum - in a location separate to the main building.  Work involved in drying and restoring the materials continued until 2013.

The National Technical Museum was closed from September 2006 to February 2011 for extensive renovations.

'''''Noren''''' (暖簾) are traditional [[Japan]]ese [[cloth|fabric]] dividers hung between rooms, on walls, in doorways, or in windows. They usually have one or more vertical slits cut from the bottom to nearly the top of the fabric, allowing for easier passage or viewing. ''Noren'' are rectangular and come in many different materials, sizes, colors, and patterns.

== Homes ==
Noren were originally used to protect a house from wind, dust, and rain, as well as to keep a house warm on cold days and to provide shade on hot summer days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://matcha-jp.com/en/1933|title=Japanese Encyclopedia: Noren {{!}} MATCHA - JAPAN TRAVEL WEB MAGAZINE|last=MATCHA|work=MATCHA - JAPAN TRAVEL WEB MAGAZINE|access-date=2017-03-18|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also be used for decorative purposes or for dividing a room into two separate spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejapaneseshop.co.uk/blog/the-story-of-japanese-noren/|title=Japanese Noren {{!}} Uses &amp; History of Japanese Noren|date=2013-09-27|work=The Japanese Shop Blog|access-date=2017-03-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Businesses ==
Exterior ''noren'' are traditionally used by shops and restaurants as a means of protection from sun, wind, and [[dust]], and for displaying a shop's name or [[logo]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Names are often Japanese characters, especially [[kanji]], but  may be [[Mon (emblem)|mon]] emblems, [[Japanese rebus monogram]]s, or abstract designs. Noren designs are generally traditional to complement their association with traditional establishments, but modern designs also exist. Interior noren are often used to separate dining areas from kitchens or other preparation areas, which also prevents smoke or smells from escaping.

Because a ''noren'' often features the shop name or logo, the word in Japanese may also refer to a company's brand value. Most notably, in Japanese [[Accountancy|accounting]], the word ''noren'' is used to describe the [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] of a company after an acquisition.

[[Sentō]] (commercial bathhouses) also place ''noren'' across their entrances, typically blue in color for men and red for women with the [[kanji]] 湯 (yu, lit. hot water) or the corresponding [[hiragana]] ゆ. They are also hung in the front entrance to a shop to signify that the establishment is open for business, and they are always taken down at the end of the business day.

'''Painting with Fire''' ('''PWF''') is the name given to an immersion process for creating torch fired [[Enamel paint|enamel]] [[jewelry]]. This process is the focal point of torch fired enamel jewelry workshops taught by '''Barbara A. Lewis''', written about in her book, and discussed in ''Belle Armoire Jewelry'',&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Lewis. ''Day into Night''. Belle Armoire Jewelry, Winter 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Lewis. ''A Wire and Fire''. Belle Armoire Jewelry, Summer 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Lewis. ''A Day at the Circus – Working with Overglaze Enamels''. Belle Armoire Jewelry, Summer 2010&lt;/ref&gt; ''Handcrafted Jewelry'',&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Lewis. ''Autumn Bliss''. Handcrafted Jewelry, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bead Trends'',&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Lewis.

==Traditional Enameling Methods==
Historically, enameling is the application of glass-on-metal (See [[vitreous enamel]]). Traditional enameling methods, such as [[Cloisonné]] and [[Grisaille]], require expensive [[kiln]]s and often years of training and experience. 

==The Painting with Fire Process==
The torch firing of enamel, a process that requires a fuel source such as propane or map gas, is inexpensive and accessible to the jewelry artist who has neither the time nor the financial resources to create a traditional enamel studio.

The predominant process for producing torch fired enamel jewelry involves placing a cold and pre-washed metal piece (typically copper) on a tripod, heating the piece with a hand-held gas-fueled torch and sifting enamel onto the heated metal. This method, while less expensive than kiln-fired enameling, can be slow and pose significant safety concerns.
 
More than 40 years ago, Joseph Spencer of [[Safety Harbor, Florida]], pioneered Multi-Torch Fired Enameling&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Spencer, Multi-torch Fire Enameling – http://www.torch-fired-enamels.com&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Lewis, a long-time ceramic artist and student of Spencer, has applied Spencer’s process to develop the Painting with Fire (PWF) Immersion Process.

Unlike the usual tripod-based torch firing methods, the PWF Immersion Process uses a mounted, inexpensive stationary torch and heating the unwashed cold metal in the flame using a welding tig rod (stainless steel mandrel). The heated metal is then immersed directly into the powdered enamel (Thompson Enamel 80 mesh opaque or transparent), then reheating and repeating the immersion process three times – a total of no more than 60–90 seconds per piece. Using Lewis’ patent pending Bead Pulling Station,&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Lewis. Bead Pulling Station. http://www.paintingwithfireartwear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=8&amp;products_id=21&lt;/ref&gt; the thrice-coated enamel bead is then gently pulled from the mandrel and allowed to fall into a simple bread pan filled with garden vermiculite.

==The PWF process with iron and sterling silver==
Other kiln and torch firing processes for producing enamel jewelry have typically been limited to pure copper or expensive fine silver. These other methods can be used to enamel sterling silver, but only after completing the laborious process of [[depletion gilding]]. With the PWF method, if using transparent enamels in cool colors (blue or green), there is no requirement to heat and dip the oxidized silver into pickling acid. The immersion method involves the same three-times heating and immersion of the sterling piece, attached to the stainless steel mandrel, and coating with transparent enamel.

Lewis’ PWF method also pioneered the enameling of lightweight iron [[filigree]] beads. The PWF immersion method allows for  artistic variations using multiple combinations of opaque and transparent enamels or reducing the oxygen to create smoky hazes. These variations and other applications of the PWF method are discussed in a "[[ning (website)|ning]]" network.&lt;ref&gt;PWF ning network – http://www.paintingwithfire.ning.com&lt;/ref&gt; The PWF immersion method is the subject of ''Torch Fired Enamel Jewelry – A Workshop in Painting with Fire''.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Lewis. ''Torch Fired Enamel Jewelry – A Workshop in Painting with Fire''. North Light Books, a division of F+W Media, August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Powers-Samas''' was a British company which sold [[unit record equipment]]. 

In 1915 [[Powers Accounting Machine|Powers Tabulating Machine Company]] established European operations through the '''Accounting and Tabulating Machine Company of Great Britain Limited''', in 1929 renamed '''Powers-Samas Accounting Machine Limited''' ('''Samas''', full name '''Societe Anonyme des Machines a Statistiques''', had been the Power's sales agency in France, formed in 1922).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerhistory.org/VirtualVisibleStorage/artifact_frame.php?tax_id=01.02.03.00 Powers-Samas Card Punch], ComputerHistory.org, accessed September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The informal reference "Acc and Tab" would persist.&lt;ref&gt;Cortada p.57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pugh p.259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Van Ness |first= Robert G. |title= Principles of Punched Card Data Processing |publisher= The Business Press |year= 1962 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War it produced large numbers of [[Typex]] cipher machines, derived from the German [[Enigma machine|Enigma]], for use by the British armed forces and other government departments. In 1959 it merged with the competing [[British Tabulating Machine Company]] (BTM) to form [[International Computers and Tabulators]] (ICT).

==Description==

&lt;!--  Powers machines were electromechanical(the operator did not have to crank the machine!), with mechanical linkages for many functions --&gt;Powers-Samas machines detected the holes in [[punched cards]] mechanically, unlike IBM equipment where holes in punched cards are detected by electrical circuits.&lt;!-- more IBM detail not needed here--&gt; Pins that could drop through round holes in punched cards were connected to linkages and their displacement when a hole was present actuated other parts of the machine to produce the desired results.

Setting up a machine involved building a suitable network of linkages. According to one user, this &lt;blockquote&gt;was achieved by locating above the reading block, in contact with the tops of the matrix pins, a removable Y-shaped  'connection box' (equivalent to the Hollerith [[plugboard|plug board]]) which was hard-wired {{sic|spcifically}} to the job. The box had at the base as many rods as were needed to read the positions within the used data fields, so that, when forced down, appropriate features of the machine - printheads, counters or control links were physically set as a reaction to the moving tops of the connecting box rods. Thus while many connection wires were straight-through, some sensed holes needed to allow multiple actuation, while some multiple code-punching needed to be combined to achieve a single purpose.  Designing the system, including setting up &lt;!----- to say the tabulator was programmed requires a definition of program that fits - and there isn't one.  See Wikipedias [[Program (machine)]].  The essence of a program is a ''list of instructions''.  Tabulators don't have that, calculators such as the IBM 604 did.  So calculators were programmed, but not tabulators,  not even in quote marks.------&gt; the tabulator, was the sales engineers job, while soldering the  'conn-box' forest of cranked rods to meet the design requirement was down to the skill of the Powers Engineer who was thus the doyen of the machine room.&lt;ref name=hart&gt;[http://www.computermuseum.org.uk/fixed_pages/tabulator.html email from Robin Hill, Norrk?ping, Sweden, 2005, to the computermuseum.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19576">'''Quality of Experience''' ('''QoE''', less frequently '''QoX''' or '''QX''') is a measure of the delight or annoyance of a customer's experiences with a service (e.g., web browsing, phone call, TV broadcast).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Qualinet White Paper on Definitions of Quality of Experience (2012). European Network on Quality of Experience in Multimedia Systems and Services (COST Action IC 1003), Patrick Le Callet, Sebastian Möller and Andrew Perkis, eds., Lausanne, Switzerland, Version 1.2, March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; QoE focuses on the entire service experience; it is a holistic concept, similar to the field of [[user experience|User Experience]], but with its roots in telecommunication.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-02681-7_3|title=Quality of Experience|last=Wechsung|first=Ina|last2=Moor|first2=Katrien De|date=2014|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319026800|editor-last=Möller|editor-first=Sebastian|series=T-Labs Series in Telecommunication Services|pages=35–54|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-02681-7_3|editor-last2=Raake|editor-first2=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; QoE is an emerging multidisciplinary field based on [[social psychology]], [[cognitive science]], [[economics]], and [[Engineering physics|engineering science]], focused on understanding overall human quality requirements.

== Definition and concepts ==
In 2013, within the context of the [[COST|COST Action]] ''[http://www.qualinet.eu/ QUALINET]'', QoE has been defined as:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The degree of delight or annoyance of the user of an application or service. It results from the fulfillment of his or her expectations with respect to the utility and / or enjoyment of the application or service in the light of the user’s personality and current state.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This definition has been adopted in 2016 by the [[ITU-T|International Telecommunication Union]] in Recommendation ITU-T P.10&lt;ref&gt;ITU-T Recommendation P.10: Vocabulary for performance and quality of service, Amendment 5 (07/16)&lt;/ref&gt;. Before, various definitions of QoE had existed in the domain, with the above-mentioned definition now finding wide acceptance in the community.

QoE has historically emerged from [[quality of service|Quality of Service]] (QoS), which attempts to objectively measure service parameters (such as [[packet loss]] rates or average [[Throughput rate|throughput]]). QoS measurement is most of the time not related to a customer, but to the media or network itself. QoE however is a purely subjective measure from the user’s perspective of the overall quality of the service provided, by capturing people’s aesthetic and hedonic needs.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6178834|title=IEEE Xplore Abstract - Toward total quality of experience: A QoE model in a communication ecosystem|date=|publisher=Ieeexplore.ieee.org|doi=10.1109/MCOM.2012.6178834|author=|accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

QoE looks at a vendor's or purveyor's offering from the standpoint of the customer or end user, and asks, "What mix of goods, services, and support, do you think will provide you with the perception that the total product is providing you with the experience you desired and/or expected?" It then asks, "Is this what the vendor/purveyor has actually provided?" If not, "What changes need to be made to enhance your total experience?" In short, QoE provides an assessment of human expectations, feelings, perceptions, cognition and satisfaction with respect to a particular product, service or application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5763609&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5763609 |title=IEEE Xplore Abstract - QoE Aware Service Delivery in Distributed Environment |doi=10.1109/WAINA.2011.58 |publisher=Ieeexplore.ieee.org |date=2011-03-25 |accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

QoE is a blueprint of all human subjective and objective quality needs and experiences arising from the interaction of a person with technology and with business entities in a particular context.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org" /&gt; Although QoE is perceived as subjective, it is an important measure that counts for customers of a service. Being able to measure it in a controlled manner helps operators understand what may be wrong with their services and how to improve them.

== QoE factors ==
QoE aims at taking into consideration every factor that contributes to a user's perceived quality of a system or service. This includes system, human and contextual factors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Factors Influencing Quality of Experience|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-02681-7_4|publisher = Springer International Publishing|date = 2014-01-01|isbn = 978-3-319-02680-0|pages = 55–72|series = T-Labs Series in Telecommunication Services|doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-02681-7_4|first = Ulrich|last = Reiter|first2 = Kjell|last2 = Brunnström|first3 = Katrien De|last3 = Moor|first4 = Mohamed-Chaker|last4 = Larabi|first5 = Manuela|last5 = Pereira|first6 = Antonio|last6 = Pinheiro|first7 = Junyong|last7 = You|first8 = Andrej|last8 = Zgank|editor-first = Sebastian|editor-last = Möller|editor-first2 = Alexander|editor-last2 = Raake}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following so-called "influence factors" have been identified and classified by Reiter et al.:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''Human Influence Factors'''
** Low-level processing (visual and auditory acuity, gender, age, mood, …)
** Higher-level processing (cognitive processes, socio-cultural and economic background, expectations, needs and goals, other personality traits…)
* '''System Influence Factors'''
** Content-related
** Media-related (encoding, resolution, sample rate, …)
** Network-related (bandwidth, delay, jitter, …)
** Device-related (screen resolution, display size, …)
* '''Context Influence Factors'''
** Physical context (location and space)
** Temporal context (time of day, frequency of use, …)
** Social context (inter-personal relations during experience)
** Economic context
** Task context (multitasking, interruptions, task type)
** Technical and information context (relationship between systems)
Studies in the field of QoE have typically focused on system factors, primarily due to its origin in the QoS and network engineering domains. Through the use of dedicated test laboratories, the context is often sought to be kept constant. However, studies investigating context and human factors have become more popular. Research has shown that human factors account for observed variations in multimedia quality ratings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=M. J.|last2=Guntuku|first2=S.

== QoE versus User Experience ==
QoE is strongly related to but different from the field of [[User experience|User Experience]] (UX), which also focuses on users' experiences with services. Historically, QoE has emerged from telecommunication research, while UX has its roots in [[Human–computer interaction|Human–Computer Interaction]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Both fields can be considered multi-disciplinary. In contrast to UX, the goal of improving QoE for users was more strongly motivated by economic needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-30382-1_21|title=Telecommunication Economics|last=Reichl|first=Peter|last2=Tuffin|first2=Bruno|last3=Maillé|first3=Patrick|date=2012|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642303814|editor-last=Hadjiantonis|editor-first=Antonis M.|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=158–166|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-30382-1_21|editor-last2=Stiller|editor-first2=Burkhard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==QoE measurement==
As a measure of the end-to-end performance at the service level from the user's perspective, QoE is an important metric for the design of systems and engineering processes. This is particularly relevant for [[Streaming media|video services]] because due to their high traffic demands, bad network performance may highly affect the user's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dobrian|first=Florin|last2=Awan|first2=Asad|last3=Joseph|first3=Dilip|last4=Ganjam|first4=Aditya|last5=Zhan|first5=Jibin|last6=Sekar|first6=Vyas|last7=Stoica|first7=Ion|last8=Zhang|first8=Hui|date=2013-03-01|title=Understanding the Impact of Video Quality on User Engagement|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2428556.2428577|journal=Commun. ACM|volume=56|issue=3|pages=91–99|doi=10.1145/2428556.2428577|issn=0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krishnan|first=S. S.|last2=Sitaraman|first2=R.

To measure this level of QoE, human ratings can be used. The [[Mean Opinion Score]] (MOS) is a widely used measure for assessing the quality of media signals. It is a limited form of QoE measurement, relating to a specific media type, in a controlled environment and without explicitly taking into account user expectations. The MOS as an indicator of experienced quality has been used for audio and speech communication, as well as for the assessment of quality of Internet video, television and other multimedia signals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winkler|first=S.|date=2009-12-01|title=Video quality measurement standards #x2014; Current status and trends|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5397585/|journal=2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)|pages=1–5|doi=10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397585}}&lt;/ref&gt; and web browsing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Egger|first=S.|last2=Hossfeld|first2=T.|last3=Schatz|first3=R.|last4=Fiedler|first4=M.|date=2012-07-01|title=Waiting times in quality of experience for web based services|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6263888/|journal=2012 Fourth International Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience|pages=86–96|doi=10.1109/QoMEX.2012.6263888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to inherent limitations in measuring QoE in a single scalar value, the usefulness of the MOS is often debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoßfeld|first=Tobias|last2=Heegaard|first2=Poul E.|last3=Varela|first3=Martín|last4=Möller|first4=Sebastian|date=2016-12-01|title=QoE beyond the MOS: an in-depth look at QoE via better metrics and their relation to MOS|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41233-016-0002-1|journal=Quality and User Experience|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1007/s41233-016-0002-1|issn=2366-0139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Subjective video quality|Subjective quality evaluation]] processes require a lot of human resources, establishing it as a time-consuming process. [[Video quality|Objective evaluation methods]] can provide quality results faster, but require dedicated machine resources and sophisticated apparatus configurations, and may not be as precise as human measurements. Towards this, objective evaluation methods may be based on and make use of multiple metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2007-09-01|title=Quantified PQoS assessment based on fast estimation of the spatial and temporal activity level|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/f8v2p4r8522664l5/|journal=Multimedia Tools and Applications|volume=34|pages=355–374|doi=10.1007/s11042-007-0111-1|accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

QoE metrics are often measured at the end devices and can conceptually be seen as the remaining quality after the distortion introduced during the preparation of the content and the delivery through the network, until it reaches the decoder at the end device. There are several elements in the media preparation and delivery chain, and some of them may introduce distortion. This causes degradation of the content, and several elements in this chain can be considered as ”QoE-relevant“ for the offered services. The causes of degradation are applicable for any multimedia service, that is, not exclusive to video or speech. Typical degradations occur at the encoding system ([[Lossy compression|compression degradation]]), transport network, access network (e.g., [[packet loss]] or [[Packet delay variation|packet delay]]), home network (e.g. [[Wi-Fi|WiFi]] performance) and end device (e.g. decoding performance).

As engineers typically work with QoS parameters, the concept of QoE in engineering is also known as “Perceived Quality of Service” (PQoS),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abbas|first=R.|date=2012-05-01|title=Human perceived quality-of-service for multimedia applications|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6512435/|journal=2012 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems|pages=1–6|doi=10.1109/ICMCS.2012.6512435}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense of the QoS as it is finally perceived by the end-user.

== QoE management ==
Several QoE-centric [[network management]] and [[bandwidth management]] solutions have been proposed, which aim to improve the QoE delivered to the end-users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Survey and Challenges of QoE Management Issues in Wireless Networks|url = http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jcnc/2013/165146/abs/|website = www.hindawi.com|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Challenges of QoE management for cloud applications|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6178831|journal = IEEE Communications Magazine|date = 2012-04-01|issn = 0163-6804|pages = 28–36|volume = 50|issue = 4|doi = 10.1109/MCOM.2012.6178831|first = T.|last = Hoßfeld|first2 = R.|last2 = Schatz|first3 = M.|last3 = Varela|first4 = C.|last4 = Timmerer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Survey on Quality of Experience of HTTP Adaptive Streaming|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6913491&amp;punumber%253D9739|journal = IEEE Communications Surveys Tutorials|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1553-877X|pages = 469–492|volume = 17|issue = 1|doi = 10.1109/COMST.2014.2360940|first = M.|last = Seufert|first2 = S.|last2 = Egger|first3 = M.|last3 = Slanina|first4 = T.|last4 = Zinner|first5 = T.|last5 = Hobfeld|first6 = P.|last6 = Tran-Gia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baraković|first=Sabina|last2=Skorin-Kapov|first2=Lea|date=2013-03-23|title=Survey and Challenges of QoE Management Issues in Wireless Networks|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jcnc/2013/165146/abs/|journal=Journal of Computer Networks and Communications|language=en|volume=2013|pages=1–28|doi=10.1155/2013/165146|issn=2090-7141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When managing a network, [[Fairness_measure#QoE_fairness|QoE fairness]] may be taken into account in order to keep the users sufficiently satisfied (i.e., high QoE) in a fair manner. From a QoE perspective, network resources and multimedia services should be [[Network management|managed]] in order to guarantee specific QoE levels instead of classical QoS parameters, which are unable to reflect the actual delivered QoE. A pure QoE-centric management is challenged by the nature of the Internet itself, as the Internet protocols and architecture were not originally designed to support today's complex and high demanding multimedia services.

As an example for an implementation of QoE management, network nodes can become QoE-aware by estimating the status of the multimedia service as perceived by the end-users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Session reconstruction for HTTP adaptive streaming: Laying the foundation for network-based QoE monitoring|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6245987|journal = 2012 IEEE 20th International Workshop on Quality of Service (IWQoS)|date = 2012-06-01|pages = 1–9|doi = 10.1109/IWQoS.2012.6245987|first = R.|last = Huysegems|first2 = B.|last2 = De Vleeschauwer|first3 = K.|last3 = De Schepper|first4 = C.|last4 = Hawinkel|first5 = Tingyao|last5 = Wu|first6 = K.|last6 = Laevens|first7 = W.|last7 = Van Leekwijck}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information can then be used to improve the delivery of the multimedia service over the network and proactively improve the users' QoE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Network-based dynamic prioritization of HTTP adaptive streams to avoid video freezes|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7140475|journal = 2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)|date = 2015-05-01|pages = 1242–1248|doi = 10.1109/INM.2015.7140475|first = S.|last = Petrangeli|first2 = T.|last2 = Wauters|first3 = R.|last3 = Huysegems|first4 = T.|last4 = Bostoen|first5 = F.|last5 = De Turck}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be achieved, for example, via [[traffic shaping]]. QoE management gives the service provider and network operator the capability to minimize storage and network resources by allocating only the resources that are sufficient to maintain a specific level of user satisfaction.

As it may involve limiting resources for some users or services in order to increase the overall network performance and QoE, the practice of QoE management requires that [[net neutrality]] regulations are considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krämer|first=Jan|last2=Wiewiorra|first2=Lukas|last3=Weinhardt|first3=Christof|title=Net neutrality: A progress report|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0308596112001450|journal=Telecommunications Policy|volume=37|issue=9|pages=794–813|doi=10.1016/j.telpol.2012.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rake''' ([[Old English language|Old English]] ''raca'', cognate with [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''raak'', [[German language|German]] ''Rechen'', from the root meaning "to scrape together", "heap up") is a [[broom]] for outside use; a [[horticulture|horticultural]] implement consisting of a toothed bar fixed transversely to a handle, and used to collect [[leaf|leaves]], [[hay]], [[grass]], etc., and in [[gardening]], for loosening the soil, light [[weeding]] and levelling, removing dead grass from lawns, and generally for purposes performed in agriculture by the [[harrow (tool)|harrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Rake |volume=22 |page=867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large mechanized versions of rakes are used in [[agriculture|farming]], called [[hay rake]]s, are built in many different forms (e.g. star-wheel rakes, rotary rakes, etc.). Nonmechanized farming may be done with various forms of a hand rake.

==History==
As weeding was a constant issue in the ancient and medieval Chinese agricultural process, it led to the invention of the weeding rake.

== Types of rakes ==
Modern hand-rakes usually have [[steel]], [[plastic]], or [[bamboo]] teeth or [[Tine (structural)|tines]], though historically they have been made with [[wood]] or [[iron]].  The handle is often made of wood or metal.  Some rakes are two-sided and made with dull blades in the shapes of slight crescents, used for removing dead grass (''thatch'') from lawns.  When rakes have longer teeth, they may be arranged in the shape of an old-style folding [[fan (implement)|fan]].

==Cultural associations==
If a rake lies in the ground with the teeth facing upwards, as shown on the top picture, and someone accidentally steps on the teeth, the rake's handle can swing rapidly upwards, colliding with the victim's face. This is often seen in [[slapstick comedy]] and [[cartoon]]s, such as ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Cape Feare]]", wherein a series of rakes become what [[Sideshow Bob]] describes as his "arch-nemesis". There is a [[Russian culture|Russian]] [[saying]] "to step on the same rake" ({{lang-ru|наступить на те же грабли}}), which means "to repeat the same silly mistake", also the word "rake" ({{lang-ru|грабли}}) in Russian slang means "troubles".

==Heavy rake==
For conditioning and dethatching soil as well as moving larger pieces of debris. Most weeds have weaker and shallower roots than grass and thus dethatching along with (afterward) necessary  sunlight, fertilizer and seed, and if later necessary any remedial chemicals, makes for a good crop of grass.  Larger tools (or lawnmower attachments) are more often used for large areas of de-thatching or soil preparation.  However the action of making the soil bare and exposed to sun is not good and worms do not like it.  It should be protected with straw afterward.  Soil aeration tools do not remove weed but prepare soil without exposure.

==Plastic or metal==
There are pros and cons to each. Plastic rakes are generally lighter weight and lower cost. Because they can be fabricated in widths of greater dimensions they are more suitable for leaves which have recently been deposited. Metal tined rakes are better suited for spring raking when the debris is often wet or rotted and can best be collected when the metal tines penetrate to the thatch layer.

[[Image:Kuehlwagen Interfrigo.jpg|thumb|Refrigerator van for the transportation of bananas]]
A '''refrigerated van''' (also called a '''refrigerated wagon''')  is a railway [[goods wagon]] with cooling equipment. Today they are designated by the [[International Union of Railways]] (UIC) as [[UIC classification of goods wagons|Class '''I''']].

==History==
The first wagons were cooled with [[ice]] that had been cut in winter from special pools or lakes. It was [[Gustavus Swift]] who succeed in the winter of 1877 for the first time in developing an efficient cooling system for railway wagons for [[Chicago]] businesses and meat producers. It circulated air through the ice and then through the entire wagon in order to cool it down. This system was the basis of the success of the [[Union Stock Yard]], the Chicago [[slaughterhouses]]. The cooled wagons made it possible for the first time to transport the meat of slaughtered animals to the whole of the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brandeins.de/ximages/27336_114schlach.pdf History of the Union Stock Yard at www.brandeins.de]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, manufactured ice was used, but this rapidly gave way to other means of cooling; the simplest was the substitution of normal (water) ice by [[dry ice]]. With the increasing reliability of [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]]s, engine-powered refrigerator vans emerged. There are even vans whose cooling is achieved by the evaporation of [[liquid gas]].

==Construction==
Compared with machine-cooled vans, ice-cooled wagons have the disadvantage of uneven temperature control, because the cooling effect is only achieved by air circulation. On the other hand, machine-cooled wagons are expensive to maintain and operate, but can be set to the desired temperature and maintained at that temperature throughout the entire journey. They are also better suited to transporting goods at deep-freeze temperatures of around {{convert|-30|°C}}, whereas evaporators and ice-cooling are more suited to maintaining temperatures of around {{convert|0|°C}}. [[Banana]] &lt;nowiki&gt;transport wagons&lt;/nowiki&gt; with gas evaporators have an optimum internal temperature of {{convert|+14.4|°C|1}}&lt;!-- Decimal point please --&gt; In addition to proper refrigerated vans, there are [[Covered goods wagon|covered wagons]] with thermal insulation and, in some cases, even those are equipped with  refrigerating sets. These wagons can only operate at temperatures between {{convert|0|and|+20|°C|°F}}, where a constant internal temperature is desired.

In Asia, Chinese and Kazakh railways are experimenting with using refrigerated rail cars to transport sensitive consumer electronic goods manufactured in China to European markets. The products are transported in climate-controlled rail cars from factory towns in the interior of China to [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]], and from there by air to Europe. The use of insulate climate-controlled cars makes it possible for these kinds of goods to be transported by rail even in winter, which had not been done previously.&lt;ref&gt;IRINA BEKTIYAROVA, [http://www.astanatimes.com/2015/04/rail-air-connection-can-bring-goods-from-china-to-europe-quickly/ Rail-Air Connection Can Bring Goods from China to Europe Quickly], 2015-04-08&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
In long-distance trains in the former [[Eastern Block]] countries, refrigerator trains were used that comprised a refrigeration plant wagon, a [[guards van]] and several refrigerated vans.

Most food is transported by road nowadays due to the shorter journey times. The stock of refrigerated vans owned by railway companies has therefore shrunk considerably. Most refrigerated vans in Europe today are operated by Interfrigo. These wagons are easy to tell apart externally: white vans are normal refrigerated wagons, blue ones with white stripes along the side are machine-cooled refrigerator vans.

==Types==
Almost all refrigerated vans currently in service are built to [[Union internationale des chemins de fer|UIC]] standard classes. The two-axled wagons have the same overall dimensions as the [[covered goods wagon]]s of classes Gbs or Hbfs.

A '''rocket mass heater''' (also termed '''rocket stove  mass heater''') is a space heating system developed from the [[rocket stove]], a type of efficient wood-burning stove, and the [[masonry heater]]. Its fundamental characteristics are an insulated combustion chamber where fuel (generally wood) is burned with high efficiency at extremely high temperatures, and a large thermal mass in contact with the exhaust gases which absorbs most of the generated heat before the gases are released to the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Evans &amp; Jackson, ''Rocket Mass Heaters'', pp. 5, 20&lt;/ref&gt; According to various reports a rocket mass heater can reduce fuel consumption by 80 - 90% compared to "conventional" stoves. 

An internal vertical insulated [[chimney]], the combustion chamber, ensures an efficient high-temperature burn and creates enough draft to push exhaust gases through the rest of the system. [[Flue gas]]es are cooled to a relatively low temperature within the thermal store, approximately 50&amp;nbsp;°C (122&amp;nbsp;°F), and in some designs steam within these gases [[condense]]s into liquid, releasing the associated [[latent heat]] of condensation which further increases the efficiency in the manner of a [[condensing boiler|condensing (gas) boiler]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, "rocket stove mass heater"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[rocket stove|rocket (cooking) stove]] was developed by the [[Aprovecho|Aprovecho Institute]], and described in 1982.&lt;ref name=whole&gt;Aprovecho, "Whole stoves"&lt;/ref&gt; A rocket stove is a cooking appliance optimized to provide relatively high heat utilization and low emissions.

[[Ianto Evans]] of the Cob Cottage Company published his how-to book 'Rocket Mass Heaters' in 2006; however, the first prototype was built in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Evans &amp; Jackson, ''Rocket Mass Heaters'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Although in some sense simply a variation on a masonry heater, most rocket mass heaters are distinct in producing immediate radiant heat (from the metal "burn" barrel), in being constructed of much cheaper materials (usually a cob mass, 55 gallon steel drum, and small brick firebox), and in requiring less robust a base to be constructed on, since a rocket mass heater's weight is distributed over a larger area. Moreover, masonry heaters have been used since pre-historic times and have evolved into various designs in Europe, Russia, and China. The key principle is the incorporation of a large thermal mass built of masonry which absorbs heat from exhausting combustion products directed in a sinuous path through channels embedded in the masonry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-01-25|title=A computational model for a rocket mass heater|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431115010820|journal=Applied Thermal Engineering|language=en|volume=93|pages=763–778|doi=10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2015.10.035|issn=1359-4311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designs==
[[File:Profil holzvergaserofen.pdf|thumb|"J-style" combustion unit of a Rocket mass heater profile view (top) and top down view (bottom). '''1''': '''Fuel feed'''. '''2''': '''Burn tunnel'''. '''3''': '''Heat riser'''. '''5''': '''Fire box''' (compromising the fuel feed, burn tunnel and heat riser). '''4''' and '''6''': '''Downdraft bell / barrel'''. '''7''': '''Manifold.''']]
In the earliest and most popular form, wood is gravity-fed into a "J-shaped" combustion chamber, from where the hot gases enter a heavily insulated fire-brick or ceramic refractory vertical secondary combustion chamber, the exhaust from which then passes along horizontal metal [[Duct (industrial exhaust)|ducting]] embedded within a massive [[Cob (material)|cob]] [[Thermal energy storage|thermal store]]. The thermal store is large enough to retain heat for many hours and may form part of the structure of the building. They have proved to be popular with [[natural building]]s and within [[permaculture]] designs; they are normally self-built and are not yet recognized by all [[building code]]s which regulate the design and construction of heating systems within buildings.

More recent alternate developments have instituted a batch-fed horizontal firebox which feeds into the vertical heat riser or secondary combustion chamber. This type is termed the "batch box rocket" and is described on Peter van den Berg's website. Also, the horizontal duct flow through the mass may be replaced by a massive "bell" of larger cross section where the hot gases slow and stratify and the cooled gases exit near the bottom as in some masonry heaters. These developments may be used in different combinations in specific instances.

==Components==
This section describes the components of a J-style RMH.
===Combustion unit===
The fuel feed receives fuel vertically.&lt;ref&gt;Wisner &amp; Wisner, ''The rocket mass heater builder's guide'', p2&lt;/ref&gt;
===Heat exchange mass===
The thermal mass which encloses the exhaust duct and absorbs heat from the hot combustion gases is normally made of “[[Cob (material)|cob]],” which is a clay and sand mixture reinforced with straw. The thermal mass is often sculpted into a bench which becomes an integral architectural feature of the home, radiating thermal energy into the space for more than 24 hours after the wood fuel is exhausted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Issues==
*Three rocket mass stoves or stove designs have been safety certified. The Liberator Rocket Heater, tested to [[Underwriters Laboratories-1482 safety standard]], which is currently on the market, the Eireco Rocket Stove  certified in Europe to BS and EN 13240, and Rocket Heater Gamera certified to EN 13240. These stoves are also currently on the market.
*Stoves are often self-built to varying dimensions to suit the location and requirements, using a variety of materials.
*Improper lighting of the fire may produce smoke that is often not drawn into the exhaust system until the burning chamber is heated and drawing air.
*A common problem with some designs is "smoke-back", where smoke from the fire is released back into the interior rather than outside.  Smoke-back could indicate a serious risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. This issue could be a result of poor individual stove design, or inadequate preheating of the exhaust tube, resulting in inefficient draft to pull the smoke through.
*In some designs, exhaust gases contain so little heat that chimney draft becomes an issue. Conventional chimneys may not be suitable for discharge without additional energy inputs.&lt;ref&gt;Evans &amp; Jackson, ''Rocket Mass Heaters'', p.&amp;nbsp;93&lt;/ref&gt;  The cool heater exhaust leaves open the question of chimney deposits such as [[creosote]], and reliable measures for cleaning such combustible deposits to reduce the risk of [[chimney fire]]s. This can be a problem if the rocket mass heater is built incorrectly; like a masonry heater, the properly built rocket mass heater burns all combustibles - including creosote - in the burn chamber and barrel.
*Horizontal [[Exhaust gas|exhaust]] [[Flue|vents]] may not be compatible with local building codes. The only advantage of the horizontal exhaust, besides usually reducing the amount of chimney pipe needed, is that remarkably high efficiency can potentially be achieved, but if so, the corrosive condensate resulting from the near-total extraction of the exhaust gases' heat must be allowed to flow out the slightly downward sloping stovepipe.

'''Roycroft''' was a reformist community of [[craft]] workers and artists which formed part of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in the United States. [[Elbert Hubbard]] founded the community in 1895, in the village of [[East Aurora, New York]], near [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. Participants were known as '''Roycrofters'''. The work and philosophy of the group, often referred to as the '''Roycroft movement''', had a strong influence on the development of American architecture and design in the early 20th century.

==History==
[[Image:Roycroft printing press.jpg|left|thumb|[[Golding Pearl]] letterpress used by the Roycrofters]]
The name "Roycroft" was chosen after the printers, Samuel and Thomas Roycroft, who made books in [[London]] from about 1650–1690. And beyond this, the word ''roycroft'' had a special significance to Elbert Hubbard, meaning ''King's Craft''. In [[guild]]s of early modern Europe, king's craftsmen were guild members who had achieved a high degree of skill and therefore made things for the King. The Roycroft insignia was borrowed from the monk [[Cassiodorus]], a 13th-century bookbinder and illuminator.

Elbert Hubbard had been influenced by the ideas of [[William Morris]] on a visit to England. He was unable to find a publisher for his book ''Little Journeys'', so inspired by Morris's [[Kelmscott Press]], decided to set up his own [[private press]] to print the book himself, founding '''Roycroft Press'''.

His championing of the Arts and Crafts approach attracted a number of visiting craftspeople to East Aurora, and they formed a community of printers, furniture makers, metalsmiths, leathersmiths, and bookbinders. A quotation from [[John Ruskin]] formed the Roycroft "creed":

&lt;blockquote&gt;A belief in working with the head, hand and heart and mixing enough play with the work so that every task is pleasurable and makes for health and happiness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The inspirational leadership of Hubbard attracted a group of almost 500 people by 1910, and millions more knew of him through his essay ''[[A Message to Garcia]]''.

The Roycroft Press is also credited for publishing partner publications, such as Carl Lothar Bredemeier's The Buffalo Magazine for Arts in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Publications, Volume 24|last=|first=|publisher=Buffalo Historical Society|year=1920|isbn=|location=Buffalo, NY|pages=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915 Hubbard and his wife, noted [[suffragist]] [[Alice Moore Hubbard]], died in the sinking of [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']], and the Roycroft community went into a gradual decline. Following Elbert's death, his son Bert took over the business. In attempts to keep his father's business afloat, Bert proposed selling Roycroft's furniture through major retailers.

[[File:Rupturedisc burst.JPG|thumb|200px|A rupture disc (burst)]]
[[File:Rupturedisc close up.JPG|thumb|200px|Pressure-effect acting at a rupture disc]]

A '''rupture disc''', also known as a '''pressure safety disc''', '''burst disc''', '''bursting disc''', or '''burst diaphragm''', is a non-reclosing [[relief valve|pressure relief]] device that, in most uses, protects a [[pressure vessel]], equipment or system from overpressurization or potentially damaging [[vacuum]] conditions. 

A rupture disc is a type of [[sacrificial part]] because it has a one-time-use membrane that fails at a predetermined differential pressure, either positive or vacuum. The membrane is usually made out of metal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT2630939&amp;id=NehHAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=rupture+disk#PPP2,M1 US Patent 2,630,939]&lt;/ref&gt; but nearly any material (or different materials in layers) can be used to suit a particular application. Rupture discs provide instant response (within milliseconds) to an increase or decrease in system pressure, but once the disc has ruptured it will not reseal. It is not possible to set an accurate pressure value at which the disc will burst. 
Major advantages of the application of rupture discs compared to using pressure relief valves include leak-tightness and cost. 

Rupture discs are commonly used in [[petrochemical]], [[aerospace]], [[aviation]], defense, medical, [[railroad]], [[nuclear engineering|nuclear]], [[chemical industry|chemical]], [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]], [[food processing]] and [[oil field]] applications. They can be used as single protection devices or as a backup device for a conventional [[safety valve]]; if the pressure increases and the safety valve fails to operate (or can't relieve enough pressure fast enough), the rupture disc will burst. Rupture discs are very often used in combination with safety relief valves, isolating the valves from the process, thereby saving on valve maintenance and creating a leak-tight pressure relief solution. It is sometimes possible, and preferable for highest reliability though at higher initial cost, to avoid the use of emergency pressure relief devices by developing an intrinsically safe mechanical design that provides containment in all cases. 

Although commonly manufactured in disc form, the devices also are manufactured as rectangular panels ('''rupture panels''' or '''vent panels'''). Device sizes range from under {{convert|0.25|in|0|abbr=on}} to at least {{convert|3|ft|1|abbr=on}}, depending upon the industry application. Rupture discs and vent panels are constructed from [[carbon steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[hastelloy]], [[graphite]], and other materials, as required by the specific use environment.

Rupture discs are widely accepted throughout industry and specified in most global pressure equipment design codes ([[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]], [[Pressure Equipment Directive|PED]], etc.). Rupture discs can be used to specifically protect installations against unacceptably high pressures or can be designed to act as one-time valves or triggering devices to initiate with high reliability and speed a sequence of actions required.

==Two main types==
The dome is weakened by precision cut scores in the material during manufacturing, often using laser technology.
So-called forward acting rupture discs have the overpressure on the concave side (inside) of the dome.  Rupture of the membrane takes place when tensile forces exceed the ultimate [[tensile stress]] of the membrane material.  Reverse acting rupture discs have the overpressure on the convex side (outside) of the dome.  Stresses cause the dome to buckle after which it fails.  The relevant material property that determines failure is the [[Young's modulus]].  Correct installation is essential. If installed upside down, the reliability of the overpressure safety device is compromised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Blowout panel==
'''Blowout panels''', also called '''blow-off panels''', areas with intentionally weakened structure, are used in enclosures, buildings or vehicles where a sudden overpressure may occur. By failing in a predictable manner, they channel the overpressure or pressure wave in the direction where it causes controlled, directed minimal harm, instead of causing a [[catastrophic failure]] of the structure. Blow-off panels are used in [[ammunition]] compartments of some [[tank]]s to protect the crew in case of ammunition explosion, turning a [[catastrophic kill]] into mere [[wikt:firepower kill|firepower kill]]. An alternative example is a deliberately weakened wall in a room used to store compressed gas cylinders; in the event of a fire or other accident, the tremendous energy stored in the (possibly flammable) compressed gas is directed into a "safe" direction, rather than potentially collapsing the structure in a similar manner to a [[thermobaric weapon]].

==Military applications==
Blowout panels are installed in several modern tanks, including the [[M1 Abrams]], and have in the past been considered as a possible solution to [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] explosions on [[battleship]]s.

In military ammunition storage, blowout panels are included in the design of the bunkers which house explosives. Such bunkers are designed, typically, with concrete walls on four sides, and a roof made of a lighter material covered with earth. In some cases this lighter material is wood, though metal sheeting is also employed.  The design is such that if an explosion or fire in the ammunition bunker (also called a locker) were to occur, the force of the blast would be directed vertically, and away from other structures and personnel.

==Applications in biology==
Some models of [[gene gun]] also use a rupture disc, but not as a safety device. Instead, their function is part of the normal operation of the device, allowing for precise pressure-based control of particle application to a sample. In these devices, the rupture disc is designed to fail within an optimal range of gas pressure that has been empirically associated with successful particle integration into tissue or cell culture. Different disc strengths can be available for some gene gun models.

[[Image:Shock tube.png|thumb|right|400px| An idealized shock tube. The plot shows different waves which are formed in the tube once the diaphragm is ruptured.]]

The '''shock tube''' is an instrument used to replicate and direct blast waves at a sensor or a model in order to simulate actual explosions and their effects, usually on a smaller scale.  Shock tubes (and related impulse facilities such as shock tunnels, expansion tubes, and expansion tunnels) can also be used to study aerodynamic flow under a wide range of temperatures and pressures that are difficult to obtain in other types of testing facilities. Shock tubes are also used to investigate compressible flow phenomena and gas phase [[combustion]] reactions.  More recently, shock tubes have been used in biomedical research to study how biological specimens are affected by blast waves.&lt;ref&gt;Cernak, I. The importance of systemic response in the pathobiology of blast-induced neurotrauma. Frontiers in Neurology 1(151):1-9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chavko, M. et al., Measurement of blast wave by a miniature fiber optic pressure transducer in the rat brain. J Neuroscience Methods, 159:277-281, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A shock wave inside a shock tube may be generated by a small explosion (blast-driven) or by the buildup of high pressures which cause diaphragm(s) to burst and a shock wave to propagate down the shock tube (compressed-gas driven).

==History==
An early study of compression driven shock tubes was published in 1899 by French scientist [[Paul Marie Eugène Vieille|Paul Vieille]], though the apparatus was not called a shock tube until the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, BD. Some aspects of the use of shock tubes in aerodynamic research. Aeronautical Research Council Reports and Memoranda. R&amp;M No. 3044, London, Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1940s, interest revived and shock tubes were increasingly used to study the flow of fast moving gases over objects, the chemistry and physical dynamics of gas phase combustion reactions. In 1966, Duff and Blackwell&lt;ref&gt;Duff, RE, Blackwell AN. Explosive driven shock tubes. Review of Scientific Instruments 37(5):579-586&lt;/ref&gt; described a type of shock tube driven by high explosives.  These ranged in diameter from 0.6 to 2 m and in length from 3 m to 15 m.  The tubes themselves were constructed of low-cost materials and produced shock waves with peak dynamic pressures of 7 MPa to 200 MPa and durations of a few hundred microseconds to several milliseconds.

Both compression-driven and blast-driven shock tubes are currently used for scientific as well as military applications. Compressed-gas driven shock tubes are more easily obtained and maintained in laboratory conditions; however, the shape of the pressure wave is different from a blast wave in some important respects and may not be suitable for some applications.  Blast-driven shock tubes generate pressure waves that are more realistic to free-field blast waves.  However, they require facilities and expert personnel for handling high explosives.   Also, in addition to the initial pressure wave, a jet effect caused by the expansion of compressed gases (compression-driven) or production of rapidly expanding gases (blast-driven) follows and may transfer momentum to a sample after the blast wave has passed.  More recently, laboratory scale shock tubes driven by fuel-air mixtures have been developed that produce realistic blast waves and can be operated in more ordinary laboratory facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Courtney MW, Courtney AC. [https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1105/1105.4670.pdf Oxy-acetylene driven laboratory scale shock tubes  for studying blast wave effects.] Cornell University Library, accessed 15 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Because the molar volume of gas is much less, the jet effect is a fraction of that for compressed-gas driven shock tubes.  To date, the smaller size and lower peak pressures generated by these shock tubes make them most useful for preliminary, nondestructive testing of materials, validation of measurement equipment such as high speed pressure transducers, and for biomedical research as well as military applications.

==Operation==
[[Image:U_of_ottawa_shock_tube_32.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aluminium foil]] used as a diaphragm between shock tube pipe segments.]]
A simple shock tube is a tube, rectangular or circular in cross-section, usually constructed of metal, in which a gas at low pressure and a gas at high pressure are separated using some form of [[rupture disc|diaphragm]].  See, for instance, texts by Soloukhin, Gaydon and Hurle, and Bradley.&lt;ref&gt;Soloukhin, R.I., ''Shock Waves and Detonations in Gases'', Mono Books, Baltimore, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaydon, A.G., and Hurle, I.R., ''The Shock Tube in High Temperature Chemical Physics'', Chapman and Hall, London, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, J., ''Shock Waves in Chemistry and Physics'', Chapman and Hall, London, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; The diaphragm suddenly bursts open under predetermined conditions to produce a wave propagating through the low pressure section. The shock that eventually forms increases the temperature and pressure of the test gas and induces a flow in the direction of the shock wave. Observations can be made in the flow behind the incident front or take advantage of the longer testing times and vastly enhanced pressures and temperatures behind the reflected wave.

The low-pressure gas, referred to as the driven gas, is subjected to the shock wave. The high pressure gas is known as the driver gas. The corresponding sections of the tube are likewise called the driver and driven sections. The driver gas is usually chosen to have a low [[molecular weight]], (e.g., [[helium]] or [[hydrogen]]) for safety reasons, with high [[speed of sound]], but may be slightly diluted to 'tailor' interface conditions across the shock. To obtain the strongest shocks the pressure of the driven gas is well below atmospheric pressure (a partial [[vacuum]] is induced in the driven section before detonation).

The test begins with the bursting of the diaphragm.&lt;ref&gt;Soloukhin, R.I., Shock Waves and Detonations in Gases, Mono Books, Baltimore, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Several methods are commonly used to burst the diaphragm. 
*A mechanically-driven plunger is sometimes used to pierce it or an explosive charge may be used to burst it.  
*Another method is to use diaphragms of plastic or metals to define specific bursting pressures. Plastics are used for the lowest burst pressures, aluminum and copper for somewhat higher levels and mild steel and stainless steel for the highest burst pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, J., Shock Waves in Chemistry and Physics, Chapman and Hall, London, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; These diaphragms are frequently scored in a cross-shaped pattern to a calibrated depth to ensure that they rupture evenly, contouring the petals so that the full section of the tube remains open during the test time. 
*Yet another method of rupturing the diaphragm utilizes a mixture of combustible gases, with an initiator designed to produce a detonation within it, producing a sudden and sharp increase in what may or may not be a pressurized driver. This blast wave increases the temperature and pressure of the driven gas and induces a flow in the direction of the shock wave but at lower velocity than the lead wave.

The bursting diaphragm produces a series of [[pressure wave]]s, each increasing the [[speed of sound]] behind them, so that they compress into a shock propagating through the driven gas. This [[shock wave]] increases the temperature and pressure of the driven gas and induces a flow in the direction of the shock wave but at lower velocity than the lead wave. Simultaneously, a [[rarefaction]] wave, often referred to as the Prandtl-Meyer wave, travels back in to the driver gas.

The interface, across which a limited degree of mixing occurs, separates driven and driver gases is referred to as the contact surface and follows, at a lower velocity, the lead wave.

A 'Chemical Shock Tube' involves separating driver and driven gases by a pair of diaphragms designed to fail after pre-determined delays with an end 'dump tank' of greatly increased cross-section. This allows an extreme rapid reduction (quench) in temperature of the heated gases.

==Applications ==
In addition to measurements of rates of [[chemical kinetics]] shock tubes have been used to measure [[dissociation energy|dissociation energies]] and [[relaxation (physics)|molecular relaxation rate]]s&lt;ref name=Strehlow&gt;Strehlow, 1967, Illinois University, Dept.Aero.and Astro. AAE Rept.76-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nettleton&gt;Nettleton, 1977, Comb.and Flame, 28,3. and 2000, Shock Waves, 12,3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gfn&gt;Gelfand, Frolov and Nettleton, 1991, Prog.Energy and Comb.Sci., 17,327.&lt;/ref&gt; they have been used in aerodynamic tests. The fluid flow in the driven gas can be used much as a [[wind tunnel]], allowing higher temperatures and pressures therein &lt;ref&gt;[[Hans W. Liepmann|Liepmann, H. W.]] and [[Anatol Roshko|Roshko, A.]], 1957, 'Elements of Gas Dynamics', Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-41963-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; replicating conditions in the [[turbine]] sections of [[jet engine]]s. However, test times are limited to a few milliseconds, either by the arrival of the contact surface or the reflected shock wave.

They have been further developed into [[shock tunnel]]s, with an added [[nozzle]] and dump tank. The resultant high temperature [[hypersonic flow]] can be used to simulate [[atmospheric re-entry]] of [[spacecraft]] or hypersonic craft, again with limited testing times.&lt;ref&gt;[[John D. Anderson|Anderson, J. D.]], 1989, 'Hypersonic and High Temperature Gas Dynamics', AIAA. {{ISBN|1-56347-459-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shock tubes have been developed in a wide range of sizes. The size and method of producing the shock wave determine the peak and duration of the pressure wave it produces. Thus, shock tubes can be used as a tool used to both create and direct blast waves at a sensor or an object in order to imitate actual explosions and the damage that they cause on a smaller scale, provided that such explosions do not involve elevated temperatures and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] or flying debris. Results from shock tube experiments can be used to develop and validate numerical model of the response of a material or object to an ambient blast wave without shrapnel or flying debris. Shock tubes can be used to experimentally determine which materials and designs would be best suited to the job of attenuating ambient blast waves without shrapnel or flying debris. The results can then be incorporated into designs to protect structures and people that might be exposed to an ambient blast wave without shrapnel or flying debris. Shock tubes are also used in biomedical research to find out how biological tissues are affected by blast waves.

A '''sugar beet''' is a plant whose root contains a high concentration of [[sucrose]] and which is grown commercially for [[sugar]] production. In plant breeding it is known as the Altissima [[cultivar group]] of the common beet (''[[Beta vulgaris]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantnames.unimelb.edu.au/Sorting/Beta.html Sorting ''Beta'' names at MMPND.] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Fu9TOBWl?url=http://www.plantnames.unimelb.edu.au/Sorting/Beta.html |date=2013-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with other beet cultivars, such as [[beetroot]] and [[chard]], it belongs to the subspecies ''Beta vulgaris'' subsp. ''vulgaris.'' Its closest wild relative is the [[sea beet]] (''Beta vulgaris'' subsp. ''maritima'').&lt;ref name=springer/&gt;

In 2013, Russia, France, the United States, Germany, and Turkey were the world's five largest sugar beet producers.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; In 2010–2011, North America and Europe did not produce enough sugar from sugar beets to meet overall demand for sugar and were all net importers of sugar.&lt;ref name=usda/&gt; The US harvested {{convert|1,004,600|acre|ha|0}} of sugar beets in 2008.&lt;ref name=usda2/&gt;  In 2009, sugar beets accounted for 20% of the world's sugar production.&lt;ref name=agrisugar1/&gt;

==Description==
The sugar beet has a conical, white, fleshy root (a [[taproot]]) with a flat crown. The plant consists of the root and a rosette of leaves. Sugar is formed by [[photosynthesis]] in the leaves and is then stored in the root.

The root of the beet contains 75% water, about 20% sugar, and 5% [[Beet pulp|pulp]].&lt;ref name=respons/&gt; The exact sugar content can vary between 12 and 21% sugar, depending on the cultivar and growing conditions. Sugar is the primary value of sugar beet as a [[cash crop]]. The pulp, [[Solubility|insoluble]] in water and mainly composed of [[cellulose]], hemicellulose, [[lignin]], and [[pectin]], is used in animal feed. The byproducts of the sugar beet crop, such as pulp and [[molasses]], add another 10% to the value of the harvest.&lt;ref name=agrisugar1/&gt;

Sugar beets grow exclusively in the [[Temperate climate|temperate]] zone, in contrast to [[sugarcane]], which grows exclusively in the tropical and subtropical zones. The average weight of sugar beet ranges between {{convert|0.5|and|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Sugar beet foliage has a rich, brilliant green color and grows to a height of about {{convert|35|cm|inch|abbr=on}}. The leaves are numerous and broad and grow in a tuft from the crown of the beet, which is usually level with or just above the ground surface.&lt;ref name=gr1/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Beta vulgaris}}
Modern sugar beets date back to mid-18th century [[Silesia]] where the king of [[Prussia]] subsidised experiments aimed at processes for sugar extraction.&lt;ref name=langer&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hill, G. |author2=Langer, R.

Moritz Baron von Koppy and his son further selected from this strain for white, conical tubers.&lt;ref name=Mansfeld/&gt; The selection was named ''weiße schlesische Zuckerrübe'', meaning white Silesian sugar beet, and boasted about a 6% sugar content.&lt;ref name=langer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mansfeld/&gt; This selection is the progenitor of all modern sugar beets.&lt;ref name=Mansfeld/&gt;

A royal decree led to the first factory devoted to sugar extraction from beetroots being opened in [[Konary, Wołów County|Kunern]], Silesia (now Konary, [[Poland]]) in 1801. The Silesian sugar beet was soon introduced to [[France]], where [[Napoleon]] opened schools specifically for studying the plant. He also ordered that {{convert|28000|ha|acre|abbr=off}} be devoted to growing the new sugar beet.&lt;ref name=langer/&gt; This was in response to British blockades of cane sugar during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], which ultimately stimulated the rapid growth of a European sugar beet industry.&lt;ref name=langer/&gt;&lt;ref name="ucdsugar"/&gt; By 1840, about 5% of the world's sugar was derived from sugar beets, and by 1880, this number had risen more than tenfold to over 50%.&lt;ref name=langer/&gt; The sugar beet was introduced to North America after 1830, with the first commercial production starting in 1879 at a farm in [[Alvarado, California]].&lt;ref name="ucdsugar"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mansfeld/&gt; The sugar beet was also introduced to [[Chile]] by German settlers around 1850.&lt;ref name=Mansfeld/&gt;

===Creation===
"The beet-root, when being boiled, yields a juice similar to syrup of sugar, which is beautiful to look at on account of its vermilion color."&lt;ref name=worldcat/&gt; This was written by 16th-century scientist, [[Olivier de Serres]], who discovered a process for preparing sugar syrup from the common red beet. However, because crystallized cane sugar was already available and provided a better taste, this process never caught on. This story characterizes the history of the sugar beet. The competition between beet sugar and sugarcane for control of the sugar market plays out from the first extraction of a sugar syrup from a garden beet into the modern day.

The use of sugar beets for the extraction of crystallized sugar dates to 1747, when Andreas Sigismund Marggraf, professor of physics in the Academy of Science of Berlin, discovered the existence of a sugar in vegetables similar in its properties to that obtained from sugarcane. He found the best of these vegetable sources for the extraction of sugar was the white beet.&lt;ref name=margg/&gt; Despite Marggraf’s success in isolating pure sugar from beets, their commercial manufacture for sugar did not take off until the early 19th century. Marggraf's student and successor Franz Karl Achard began selectively breeding sugar beet from the 'White Silesian' fodder beet in 1784. By the beginning of the 19th century, his beet was about 5–6% sucrose by (dry) weight, compared to around 20% in modern varieties. Under the patronage of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]], he opened the world's first beet [[sugar factory]] in 1801, at Cunern (Polish: Konary) in Silesia.&lt;ref name=gr1/&gt;

===France===
[[File:French sugar beet mill, 1843.jpg|thumb|French sugar beet mill in operation in the 1840s]]
The work of Achard soon attracted the attention of [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], who appointed a commission of scientists to go to Silesia to investigate Achard's factory. Upon their return, two small factories were constructed near Paris. Although these factories were not altogether a success, the results attained greatly interested Napoleon. Thus, when two events, the blockade of Europe by the British Navy and the Haitian Revolution against his brother-in-law, made the importation of cane sugar untenable, Napoleon seized the opportunity offered by beet sugar to address the shortage. In 1811, Napoleon issued a decree appropriating one million [[franc]]s for the establishment of sugar schools, and compelling the farmers to plant a large acreage to sugar beets the following year. He also prohibited the further importation of sugar from the Caribbean effective in 1813.&lt;ref name="Dowling 1928"/&gt;

The number of mills increased considerably during the 1820s and 1830s, reaching a peak of 543 in 1837. The number was down to 382 in 1842, producing about 22.5 million kg of sugar during that year.&lt;ref&gt;L'Illustration Journal Universel, 13 May 1843.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Europe===
As a result of the French advances in sugar beet production and processing made during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the beet sugar industry in Europe developed rapidly. A new tax levied in Germany in 1810 prompted the experimentation to increase the sugar content of the beet. This was because the tax assessed the value of the sugar beet crop based on the unprocessed weight of the sugar beet rather than the refined sugar produced from them.&lt;ref name="Dowling 1928"/&gt;&lt;ref name=poggi/&gt; By 1812, Frenchman [[Jean-Baptiste Quéruel]], working for the industrialist [[Benjamin Delessert]], devised a process of sugar extraction suitable for industrial application. By 1837, France had become the largest sugar beet producer in the world, a position it continued to hold in the world even into 2010. By 1837,  542 factories in France were producing 35,000 tonnes of sugar. However, by 1880, Germany became the largest producer of sugar from sugar beet in the world, since the German factories processed most of the sugar beets grown in eastern France.&lt;ref name="gr1"/&gt;

By the 1850s, sugar beet production had reached Russia and Ukraine. This was made possible by the protection of the sugar beet industry by bounties, or subsidies, paid to beet sugar producers upon the export of their sugar by their respective governments.&lt;ref name="Dowling 1928"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kenneth Kiple"/&gt; The protection provided to the sugar beet industry by these bounties caused drastic damage to the cane sugar industry and their grip on the British sugar market. The result was a reduction in the production of cane sugar, molasses and rum until 1915.&lt;ref name="Dowling 1928"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tasti/&gt; During World War I, the widespread conflict destroyed large tracts of land that had served as sugar beet producers and repurposed much of the remaining sugar beet land for grain production. This resulted in a shortage that revived the shrinking cane sugar industry.&lt;ref name="Dowling 1928"/&gt;

===United States===
The first attempts at sugar beet cultivation were pursued by [[abolitionists]] in New England. The "Beet Sugar Society of Philadelphia" was founded in 1836 and promoted home-produced beet sugar as an alternative to the slave-produced cane sugar from the [[West Indies]] or sugar imported from Asia (called "free sugar" because it was grown without using slavery), but which tasted "awful".&lt;ref name="Kaufman 2008 95–104"/&gt; However, this movement failed, perhaps most due to the unpopularity of abolitionists at the time, at least until the Civil War, when these associations would become irrelevant and only the economic feasibility of the industry remained.&lt;ref name="Kaufman 2008 95–104"/&gt;

In the 1850s, an attempt was made in [[Utah]] by the [[LDS Church]]-owned [[Deseret Manufacturing Company]] to grow and process sugar beets, that failed for several reasons. First, the beet seeds they imported from France were not able to produce much sugar in the heavily salinized soil of Utah. Second, the cost of importing the beet seed from France ate up any possibility for profit. Finally, none of the people running the factory knew how to properly use the chemicals to separate the sugar from the beet pulp.&lt;ref name="Robert M. Harveson"/&gt;

The first successful sugar beet factory was built by [[E. H. Dyer]] at Alvarado, California (now [[Union City, California|Union City]]), in 1870, but did not see any profit until 1879. The factory survived on subsidies it gained, since the abolitionist stigma that had held back the development of a sugar beet industry had been erased with the Civil War.&lt;ref name="Kaufman 2008 95–104"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert M. Harveson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Magnuson 1918 68–79"/&gt;
After this first success in Alvarado, the sugar beet industry expanded rapidly. In 1889, [[Arthur Stayner]] and others were able to convince LDS Church leaders to back a second attempt, leading to the [[Utah-Idaho Sugar Company]].&lt;ref name="Arrington"&gt;{{cite book |last= Arrington |first= Leonard J. |authorlink= Leonard J. Arrington |title= Beet sugar in the West; a history of the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company, 1891–1966 |publisher= [[University of Washington Press]] |year= 1966 |oclc= 234150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="godfrey"&gt;{{cite book |last= Godfrey |first= Matthew C. |title= Religion, politics, and sugar: the Mormon Church, the federal government, and the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company, 1907-1921 |publisher= [[Utah State University Press]] |location= Logan, Utah |year= 2007 |isbn= 978-0-87421-658-5 |oclc= 74988178 |url= http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/usupress_pubs/44/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1914, the sugar beet industry in the United States matched the production of its European counterparts. The largest producers of beet sugar in the United States would remain California, Utah, and Nebraska until the outbreak of World War II.&lt;ref name="Magnuson 1918 68–79"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tauss/&gt; Many sugar beet farmers in California were [[Japanese Americans]]; when they were interned during World War II, California's beet sugar production also shifted inland to states such as Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, and Utah. In many of the regions where new sugar beet farms were started during the war, farmers were unfamiliar with beet sugar cultivation, so they hired Japanese workers from [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment camps]] who were familiar with sugar beet production to work on the farms.&lt;ref name=fiset/&gt;

Sugar beets are grown in 11 states and represent 55% of the US sugar production&lt;ref&gt;http://cropwatch.unl.edu/history-sugarbeets&lt;/ref&gt; as compared to sugar cane which is grown in 4 states&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/X0513E/x0513e15.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and accounts for 45% of US sugar production.

===United Kingdom===
Sugar beets were not grown on a large scale in the United Kingdom until the mid-1920s, when 17 processing factories were built, following war-time shortages of imported cane sugar. Before World War I, with its far-flung empire, the United Kingdom simply imported the sugar from the cheapest market. However, World War I had created a shortage in sugar, prompting the development of a domestic market. The first sugar beet processing factory was built at [[Lavenham]] in [[Suffolk]] in 1860, but failed after a few years without the government support its counterparts on the continent received. The Dutch built the first successful factory at Cantley in Norfolk in 1912, and it was moderately successful since, because of its Dutch backing, it received Dutch bounties.&lt;ref name="Dowling 1928"/&gt;

Sugar beet seed from France was listed in the annual catalogues of [[Gartons Agricultural Plant Breeders]] from that firm's inception in 1898 until the first of their own varieties was introduced in 1909. In 1915, the British Sugar Beet Society was formed to create an example of a domestic sugar beet industry for the purpose of obtaining government financing. Twelve years later, in 1927, they succeeded. The sugar beet industry in the United Kingdom was finally subsidized providing stability to the domestic industry that had experienced volatile shifts in profits and losses in the years since 1915.&lt;ref name="Dowling 1928"/&gt;

===Russia===
References to the sugar manufacturing from beets in Russia are dating back to 1802. [[Jacob Stepanovich Esipov|Jacob Esipov]]  has built a first Russian commercial factory producing sugar from beets in the Tula province.&lt;ref&gt;[https://slovar.wikireading.ru/2456463 "slovar.wikireading"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landwirt.ru/2009-12-12-16-06-01/441 "History of sugar production"]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Soviet period, some particularly impressive advancements were made in seed development, of which the most useful was the development of a frost-resistant sugar beet, further expanding the growing range of the sugar beet.&lt;ref name=buzan/&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Zuckerrüben Pflug010.jpg|thumb|A sugar beet farm in Switzerland]]
[[File:Sugarbeetoutput.png|thumb|Worldwide sugar beet production]]

The sugar beet, like [[sugarcane]], needs a peculiar [[soil]] and a unique climate for its successful cultivation. The most important requirement is the soil must contain a large supply of plant food, be rich in [[humus]], and have the property of retaining a great deal of moisture. A certain amount of [[alkali]] is not necessarily detrimental, as sugar beets are not especially susceptible to injury by some alkali. The ground should be fairly level and well-drained, especially where [[irrigation]] is practiced.&lt;ref name=gr1/&gt;

While the physical character is of secondary importance, as generous crops are grown in sandy soil as well as in heavy [[loam]]s, still the ideal soil is a sandy loam, i.e., a mixture of organic matter, clay and sand. A subsoil of gravel, or the presence of hard-pan, is not desirable, as cultivation to a depth of from {{convert|12|to|15|in|cm|1}} is necessary to produce the best results.

Climatic conditions, temperature, sunshine, rainfall and winds have an important bearing upon the success of sugar beet agriculture. A temperature ranging from {{convert|15|to|21|°C|°F|1}} during the growing months is most favorable. In the absence of adequate irrigation, {{convert|460|mm|in|1|abbr=in}} of rainfall are necessary to raise an average crop. High winds are harmful, as they generally crust the land and prevent the young beets from coming through the ground. The best results are obtained along the coast of southern California, where warm, sunny days succeeded by cool, foggy nights seem to meet sugar beet's favored growth conditions. Sunshine of long duration but not of great intensity is the most important factor in the successful cultivation of sugar beets. Near the equator, the shorter days and the greater heat of the sun sharply reduce the sugar content in the beet.&lt;ref name=gr1/&gt;

In high elevation regions such as those of Colorado and Utah, where the temperature is high during the daytime, but where the nights are cool, the quality of the sugar beet is excellent. In [[Michigan]], the long summer days from the relatively high latitude (the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]], where production is concentrated, lies between the 41st and 46th parallels North) and the influence of the Great Lakes result in satisfactory climatic conditions for sugar beet culture. [[Sebewaing, Michigan]] lies in [[the Thumb]] region of Michigan; both the region and state are major sugar beet producers. Sebewaing is home to one of three [[Michigan Sugar Company]] factories.  The town sponsors an annual Michigan Sugar Festival.&lt;ref name=voices/&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}

To cultivate beets successfully, the land must be properly prepared. Deep ploughing is the first principle of beet culture. It allows the roots to penetrate the subsoil without much obstruction, thereby preventing the beet from growing out of the ground, besides enabling it to extract considerable nourishment and moisture from the lower soil. If the latter is too hard, the roots will not penetrate it readily and, as a result, the plant will be pushed up and out of the earth during the process of growth. A hard subsoil is impervious to water and prevents proper drainage. It should not be too loose, however, as this allows the water to pass through more freely than is desirable. Ideally, the soil should be deep, fairly fine and easily penetrable by the roots. It should also be capable of retaining moisture and at the same time admit of a free circulation of air and good drainage. Sugar beet crops exhaust the soil rapidly. Crop rotation is recommended and necessary. Normally, beets are grown in the same ground every third year, peas, beans or grain being raised the other two years.&lt;ref name=gr1/&gt;

[[File:Entladung Bunker.JPG|thumb|A sugar beet harvest in progress, Germany]]
In most [[temperate]] climates, beets are planted in the spring and harvested in the autumn. At the northern end of its range, growing seasons as short as 100 days can produce commercially viable sugar beet crops. In warmer climates, such as in [[California]]'s [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valley]], sugar beets are a winter crop, planted in the autumn and harvested in the spring. In recent years, [[Syngenta]] has developed the so-called tropical sugar beet. It allows the plant to grow in tropical and subtropical regions. Beets are planted from a small seed; {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of beet seed comprises 100,000 seeds and will plant over {{convert|1|ha|acre|spell=in|lk=on}} of ground ({{convert|1|lb|kg|3|spell=in|disp=or}} will plant about {{convert|1|acre|ha|spell=in|disp=or}}.

Until the latter half of the 20th century, sugar beet production was highly labor-intensive, as weed control was managed by densely planting the crop, which then had to be manually thinned two or three times with a [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] during the growing season. Harvesting also required many workers. Although the roots could be lifted by a [[plough]]-like device which could be pulled by a horse team, the rest of the preparation was by hand. One laborer grabbed the beets by their leaves, knocked them together to shake free loose soil, and then laid them in a row, root to one side, greens to the other. A second worker equipped with a beet hook (a short-handled tool  between a [[billhook]] and a [[sickle]]) followed behind, and would lift the beet and swiftly chop the crown and leaves from the root with a single action. Working this way, he would leave a row of beets that could be forked into the back of a [[cart]].

Today, mechanical sowing, [[herbicide]] application for weed control, and mechanical harvesting have displaced this reliance on manual farm work. A root beater uses a series of blades to chop the leaf and crown (which is high in nonsugar impurities) from the root. The [[Sugar beet harvester|beet harvester]] lifts the root, and removes excess soil from the root in a single pass over the field. A modern harvester is typically able to cover six rows at the same time. The beets are dumped into trucks as the harvester rolls down the field, and then delivered to the factory. The conveyor then removes more soil.

If the beets are to be left for later delivery, they are formed into [[storage clamp|clamps]]. Straw bales are used to shield the beets from the weather. Provided the clamp is well built with the right amount of ventilation, the beets do not significantly deteriorate. Beets that freeze and then defrost, produce complex carbohydrates that cause severe production problems in the factory. In the UK, loads may be hand examined at the factory gate before being accepted.

In the US, the fall harvest begins with the first hard frost, which arrests [[photosynthesis]] and the further growth of the root. Depending on the local climate, it may be carried out over the course of a few weeks or be prolonged throughout the winter months. The harvest and processing of the beet is referred to as "the campaign", reflecting the organization required to deliver the crop at a steady rate to processing factories that run 24 hours a day for the duration of the harvest and processing (for the UK, the campaign lasts about five months). In the Netherlands, this period is known as ''de bietencampagne'', a time to be careful when driving on local roads in the area while the beets are being grown, because the naturally high [[clay]] content of the soil tends to cause slippery roads when soil falls from the trailers during transport.

[[File:2005sugar beet.PNG|thumb|right|Sugar beet output in 2009]]
The world harvested {{convert|250191362|t|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of sugar beets in 2013. The world's largest producer was the [[United States]], with a {{convert|39321161|t|sigfig=3|sp=us}} harvest.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; The average yield of sugar beet crops worldwide was 58.2 tonnes per [[hectare]].

The most productive sugar beet farms in the world, in 2010, were in [[Chile]], with a nationwide average yield of 87.3 tonnes per hectare.&lt;ref name=fao2/&gt;

[[Imperial Valley (California)]] farmers have achieved yields of about 160 tonnes per hectare and over 26 tonnes sugar per hectare. Imperial Valley farms benefit from high intensities of incident sunlight and intensive use of irrigation and fertilizers.&lt;ref name=sasta/&gt;&lt;ref name=farmg/&gt;

The sugar industry in the EU came under bureaucratic pressure in 2006 and ultimately resulted in the loss of 20,000 jobs, although many factories, as detailed in a later 2010 EU audit, were found to have been mistakenly shut down, as they were profitable without government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/1110/greencore-business.html |title=Greencore sugar plant closure unnecessary? - RTÉ News |publisher=Rte.ie |date=2010-11-10 |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Western Europe, and Eastern Europe did not produce enough sugar from sugar beets to meet overall demand for sugar in 2010–2011, and were net importers of sugar.&lt;ref name=usda/&gt;

==Processing==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
;Reception
After they are harvested, beets are typically transported to a factory. In the UK, beets are transported by a hauler, or by a tractor and a trailer by local farmers. Railways and boats are no longer used. Some beets were carried by rail in the [[Republic of Ireland]], until the complete shutdown of [[Irish Sugar]] beet production in 2006.

Each load is weighed and sampled before it gets tipped onto the reception area, typically a "flat pad" of concrete, where it is moved into large heaps. The beet sample is checked for
* soil tare – the amount of nonbeet delivered
* crown tare – the amount of low-sugar beet delivered
* sugar content ([[Polarimetry|"pol"]]) - amount of sucrose in the crop
* nitrogen content – for recommending future fertilizer use to the farmer.

From these elements, the actual sugar content of the load is calculated and the grower's payment determined.

The beet is moved from the heaps into a central channel or gulley, where it is washed towards the processing plant.

;Diffusion
[[File:Sugar beet cossettes.jpg|thumb|Dried sugar beet cossettes]]
After reception at the processing plant, the beet roots are washed, mechanically sliced into thin strips called '''cossettes''', and passed to a machine called a diffuser to extract the sugar content into a water solution.

Diffusers are long vessels of many metres in which the beet slices go in one direction while hot water goes in the opposite direction. The movement may either be caused by a rotating screw or the whole rotating unit, and the water and cossettes move through internal chambers. The three common designs of diffuser are the horizontal rotating 'RT' ''([[Raffinerie Tirlemontoise]]'', manufacturer), inclined screw 'DDS' (''De Danske Sukkerfabrikker''), or vertical screw "Tower". Modern tower extraction plants have a processing capacity of up to {{convert|17,000|t|sigfig=3|sp=us|lk=on}} per day.&lt;ref name=bmade/&gt; A less-common design uses a moving belt of cossettes, with water pumped onto the top of the belt and poured through. In all cases, the flow rates of cossettes and water are in the ratio one to two. Typically, cossettes take about 90 minutes to pass through the diffuser, the water only 45 minutes. These [[countercurrent exchange]] methods extract more sugar from the cossettes using less water than if they merely sat in a hot water tank. The liquid exiting the diffuser is called '''raw juice'''. The colour of raw juice varies from black to a dark red depending on the amount of oxidation, which is itself dependent on diffuser design.

The used cossettes, or '''pulp''', exit the diffuser at about 95% moisture, but low sucrose content. Using [[screw press]]es, the wet pulp is then pressed down to 75% moisture. This recovers additional sucrose in the liquid pressed out of the pulp, and reduces the energy needed to dry the pulp. The pressed pulp is dried and sold as animal feed, while the liquid pressed out of the pulp is combined with the raw juice, or more often introduced into the diffuser at the appropriate point in the countercurrent process. The final byproduct, [[vinasse]], is used as fertilizer or growth substrate for yeast cultures.

During diffusion, a portion of the sucrose breaks down into [[invert sugar]]s.  These can undergo further breakdown into acids. These breakdown products are not only losses of sucrose, but also have knock-on effects reducing the final output of processed sugar from the factory. To limit (thermophilic) bacterial action, the feed water may be dosed with [[formaldehyde]] and control of the feed water [[pH]] is also practiced. Attempts at operating diffusion under alkaline conditions have been made, but the process has proven problematic.  The improved sucrose extraction in the diffuser is offset by processing problems in the next stages.

;Carbonatation
[[File:Suikerbietenrooier zesrijige bunker (Sugarbeet harvester).jpg|thumb|left|A beet harvester]]
[[Carbonatation]] is a procedure which removes impurities from raw juice before it undergoes crystallization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t08wJ9MRSXwC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Carbonatation+is+a+procedure+which+removes+impurities+from+raw+sugar+beet+juice+before+it+undergoes+crystallization&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_0Pfjj5vVAhVI9WMKHdd8CtMQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Carbonatation%20is%20a%20procedure%20which%20removes%20impurities%20from%20raw%20sugar%20beet%20juice%20before%20it%20undergoes%20crystallization&amp;f=false|title=Chemical Process Technology and Simulation|last=KOYIKKAL|first=SRIKUMAR|date=2013-04-08|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=9788120347090|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the juice is mixed with hot [[milk of lime]] (a suspension of [[calcium hydroxide]] in water). This treatment [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitates]] a number of impurities, including multivalent [[anion]]s such as [[sulfate]], [[phosphate]], [[citrate]] and [[oxalate]], which precipitate as their calcium salts and large organic molecules such as [[protein]]s, [[saponin]]s and [[pectin]]s, which aggregate in the presence of multivalent [[cation]]s. In addition, the alkaline conditions convert the simple sugars, [[glucose]] and [[fructose]], along with the amino acid [[glutamine]], to chemically stable [[carboxylic acid]]s. Left untreated, these sugars and amines would eventually frustrate crystallization of the sucrose.

Next, [[carbon dioxide]] is bubbled through the alkaline sugar solution, precipitating the lime as [[calcium carbonate]] ([[chalk]]). The chalk particles entrap some impurities and [[absorption (chemistry)|absorb]] others. A recycling process builds up the size of chalk particles and a natural [[flocculation]] occurs where the heavy particles settle out in tanks (clarifiers). A final addition of more carbon dioxide precipitates more calcium from solution; this is filtered off, leaving a cleaner, golden light-brown sugar solution called '''thin juice'''.

Before entering the next stage, the thin juice may receive [[soda ash]] to modify the pH and sulphitation with a [[sulfur]]-based compound to reduce colour formation due to decomposition of monosaccharides under heat.

;Evaporation
[[File:Hollogne sur-geer -Sucrerie.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A sugar beet farm in Belgium: Beyond the field is the sugar factory.]]
[[File:BritishSugarAlscottCB.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[sugar refinery]] in [[Shropshire]], England]]
The thin juice is concentrated via [[multiple-effect evaporation]] to make a '''thick juice''', roughly 60% sucrose by weight and similar in appearance to [[Maple syrup|pancake syrup]]. Thick juice can be stored in tanks for later processing, reducing the load on the crystallization plant.

;Crystallization
Thick juice is fed to the crystallizers. Recycled sugar is dissolved into it, and the resulting syrup is called [[mother liquor]].  The liquor is concentrated further by boiling under a vacuum in large vessels (the so-called vacuum pans) and seeded with fine sugar crystals. These crystals grow as sugar from the mother liquor forms around them. The resulting sugar crystal and syrup mix is called a ''massecuite'', from "cooked mass" in [[French language|French]]. The massecuite is passed to a [[centrifuge]], where the High Green syrup is removed from the massecuite by centrifugal force. After a predetermined
time, water is then sprayed into the centrifuge via a spray bar to wash the sugar crystals which produces Low Green syrup. The centrifuge then spins at very high speed to partially dry the crystals the machine then slows down and a plough shaped arm is deployed which ploughs out the sugar from the sides of the centrifuge from the top to the bottom onto conveying plant underneath where it is transported into a rotating granulator where it is dried using warm air.

The high green syrup is fed to a raw sugar vacuum pan from which a second batch of sugar is produced. This sugar ("raw") is of lower quality with more colour and impurities, and is the main source of the sugar dissolved again into the mother liquor. The syrup from the raw (Low green syrup) is boiled for a long time in AP Pans and sent to slowly flow around a series of about eight crystallisers. From this, a very low-quality sugar crystal is produced (known in some systems as "AP sugar") that is also redissolved. The syrup separated is [[molasses]], which still contains sugar, but contains too much impurity to undergo further processing economically. The molasses is stored on site and is added to dried beet pulp to make animal feed. Some is also sold in bulk tankers.

Actual procedures may vary from the above description, with different recycling and crystallisation processes.

==Other uses==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
[[File:Tuzemsky.JPG|thumb|upright=0.52|''[[Tuzemák]]'', a sugar-beet-based alcohol brand from Czech Republic, is golden red in color.]]
;Beverages
In a number of countries, notably the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], beet sugar is used to make a [[rum]]-like [[distilled spirit]] called ''[[Tuzemak]]''. On the [[Åland|Åland Islands]], a similar drink is made under the brand name ''Kobba Libre''. In some European countries, especially in the Czech Republic and Germany, beet sugar is also used to make [[rectified spirit]] and [[vodka]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;An unrefined sugary syrup is produced directly from the sugar beet. This thick, dark syrup is produced by cooking shredded sugar beet for several hours, then pressing the resulting mash and concentrating the juice produced until it has a consistency similar to that of honey and in the Czech Republic, beet sugar is used to make a rum-like distilled spirit all Czechs know as their rum, an alcoholic beverage called Tuzemák, formerly called Tuzemský rum (English: domestic rum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tresbohemes.com/2017/02/czechs-and-their-billion-dollar-beets/|title=Czechs and Their Billion Dollar Beets|publisher=Tres Bohemes|accessdate=2018-04-15|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Sugar beet syrup
[[File:Molasses.JPG|thumb|left|Sugar beet molasses in France, used as cattle [[fodder]] supplement]]
An unrefined sugary syrup can be produced directly from sugar beet. This thick, dark syrup is produced by cooking shredded sugar beet for several hours, then pressing the resulting mash and concentrating the juice produced until it has a consistency similar to that of [[honey]]. No other ingredients are used. In Germany, particularly the [[Rhineland]] area, this sugar beet syrup (called ''Zuckerrüben-Sirup'' or ''Zapp'' in German) is used as a spread for sandwiches, as well as for sweetening sauces, cakes and desserts.

Commercially, if the syrup has a [[Dextrose equivalent|dextrose equivalency (DE)]] above 30, the product has to be [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] and converted to a high-fructose syrup, much like [[high-fructose corn syrup]], or isoglucose syrup in the EU.

Many road authorities in North America use desugared beet molasses as de-icing or anti-icing products in winter control operations.  The molasses can be used directly,&lt;ref name="sugar.ca"/&gt; combined with liquid chlorides and applied to road surfaces, or used to treat the salt spread on roads.&lt;ref name="CAS Article"/&gt; Molasses can be more advantageous than road salt alone because it reduces corrosion and lowers the freezing point of the salt-brine mix, so the de-icers remain effective at lower temperatures.&lt;ref name="sugar.ca"/&gt; The addition of the liquid to rock salt has the additional benefits that it reduces the bounce and scatter of the rock salt, keeping it where it is needed, and reduces the activation time of the salt to begin the melting process.&lt;ref name="CAS Article"/&gt;

;Betaine
[[Betaine]] can be isolated from the byproducts of sugar beet processing. Production is chiefly through [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] separation, using techniques such as the "simulated moving bed".

;Uridine
[[Uridine]] can be isolated from sugar beet.

;Alternative fuel
[[BP]] and [[Associated British Foods]] plan to use agricultural surpluses of sugar beet to produce [[biobutanol]] in [[East Anglia]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

The feedstock-to-yield ratio for sugarbeet is 56:9. Therefore, it takes 6.22&amp;nbsp;kg of sugar beet to produce 1&amp;nbsp;kg of ethanol (approximately 1.27 l at room temperature).

==Agriculture==
[[File:Dammanbau Zuckerruebe.svg|thumb|Sugar beet farming using dam culture method.  Used in Russia, Germany, France, Ukraine, Turkey, China, Poland, and sometimes Egypt]]
Sugar beets are an important part of a [[crop rotation]] cycle.

Sugar beet plants are susceptible to ''[[Beet necrotic yellow vein virus|Rhizomania]]'' ("root madness"), which turns the bulbous tap root into many small roots, making the crop economically unprocessable. Strict controls are enforced in European countries to prevent the spread, but it is already endemic in some areas. It is also susceptible to the [[beet leaf curl virus]], which causes crinkling and stunting of the leaves.

Continual research looks for varieties with resistance, as well as increased sugar yield.  Sugar beet breeding research in the United States is most prominently conducted at various [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] Agricultural Research Stations, including one in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], headed by Linda Hanson and Leonard Panella; one in [[Fargo, North Dakota]], headed by John Wieland; and one at [[Michigan State University]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan]], headed by J. Mitchell McGrath.

Other economically important members of the [[Chenopodioideae]] subfamily:
* [[Beetroot]]
* [[Chard]]
* ''[[Mangelwurzel]]'' or fodder beet.

===Genetic modification===
{{Main|Genetically modified sugar beet}}
In the United States, genetically modified sugar beets, engineered for resistance to [[glyphosate]], a [[herbicide]] marketed as Roundup, were developed by [[Monsanto]] as a [[genetically modified crop]]. In 2005, the US Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ([[USDA]]-[[APHIS]]) deregulated glyphosate-resistant sugar beets after it conducted an environmental assessment and determined glyphosate-resistant sugar beets were highly unlikely to become a plant pest.&lt;ref name="Roundup Ready Sugarbeets"/&gt;&lt;ref name=APHIS-history/&gt; Sugar from glyphosate-resistant sugar beets has been approved for human and animal consumption in multiple countries, but commercial production of biotech beets has been approved only in the United States and Canada.  Studies have concluded the sugar from glyphosate-resistant sugar beets has the same nutritional value as sugar from conventional sugar beets.&lt;ref name=AppealDecision2011 /&gt; After deregulation in 2005, glyphosate-resistant sugar beets were extensively adopted in the United States. About 95% of sugar beet acres in the US were planted with glyphosate-resistant seed in 2011.&lt;ref name=James2011/&gt;

Weeds may be chemically controlled using [[glyphosate]] without harming the crop.  After planting sugar beet seed, weeds emerge in fields and growers apply glyphosate to control them.  Glyphosate is commonly used in field crops because it controls a broad spectrum of weed species&lt;ref name=michsug/&gt; and has a low [[toxicity]].&lt;ref name=usda3/&gt; A study from the UK&lt;ref name=nih/&gt; suggests yields of genetically modified beet were greater than conventional, while another from the North Dakota State University extension service found lower yields.&lt;ref name=nlpw/&gt; The introduction of glyphosate-resistant sugar beets may contribute to the growing number of glyphosate-resistant weeds, so Monsanto has developed a program to encourage growers to use different herbicide modes of action to control their weeds.&lt;ref name="New Releases"/&gt;

In 2008, the [[Center for Food Safety]], the [[Sierra Club]], the Organic Seed Alliance and High Mowing Seeds filed a lawsuit against [[USDA]]-[[APHIS]] regarding their decision to deregulate glyphosate-resistant sugar beets in 2005.  The organizations expressed concerns regarding glyphosate-resistant sugar beets' ability to potentially [[cross-pollinate]] with conventional sugar beets.&lt;ref name="Roundup Ready Sugar Beet Case: Timeline"/&gt; U.S. District Judge [[Jeffrey White|Jeffrey S. White]], [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|US District Court for the Northern District of California]], revoked the deregulation of glyphosate-resistant sugar beets and declared it unlawful for growers to plant glyphosate-resistant sugar beets in the spring of 2011.&lt;ref name="Roundup Ready Sugar Beet Case: Timeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name=usda5/&gt; Believing a sugar shortage would occur USDA-APHIS developed three options in the environmental assessment to address the concerns of environmentalists.&lt;ref name="USDA Prepares Draft Environmental Assessment on Regulatory Options for Roundup Ready Sugar Beets"/&gt; In 2011, a federal appeals court for the Northern district of California in San Francisco overturned the ruling.&lt;ref name=AppealDecision2011/&gt; In July 2012, after completing an environmental impact assessment and a plant pest risk assessment the USDA deregulated Monsanto's Roundup Ready sugar beets.&lt;ref name=usda6/&gt;

The U.S. Treasury tried to stop the deal for [[tax inversion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/05/08/syngenta-ma-monsanto-idUKL5N0XY6C020150508|title=RPT-Monsanto and Syngenta hire U.S. banks to advise on possible takeover|work=Reuters|date=8 May 2015|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syngenta's Board of Directors rejected an even better offer by Monsanto during August 2015, and Monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on 26 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Agribusiness/Monsanto-drops-pursuit-of-Swiss-rival-Syngenta-20150827|title=Monsanto drops pursuit of Swiss rival Syngenta.|website=fin24.com|date=27 August 2015|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Swiss business weekly, [[:de:Finanz und Wirtschaft|Finanz und Wirtschaft]], many Syngenta shareholders were enraged, both by the company's refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with Monsanto, and with the subsequent offer withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressreader.com/switzerland/finanz-und-wirtschaft/20150919/281582354423595/TextView |title= Verheissungen |publisher=Finanz und Wirtschaft |date=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJMonsantoBidRejected&gt;{{cite web|last1=Revill|first1=John|title=Some Syngenta Shareholders Unhappy After Monsanto’s Bid Was Rejected|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-syngenta-shareholders-unhappy-after-monsantos-bid-was-rejected-1440783727|website=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the ''Alliance of Critical Syngenta Shareholders'', which urged the Board to "evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice".&lt;ref name=ShareholderGroup&gt;{{cite web|title=Disgruntled Syngenta investors set up shareholder group|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/17/syngenta-shareholders-idUSL8N12H06620151017|website=Reuters|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent interview, Chairman Michel Demaré was asked whether Syngenta could remain independent.  He responded, "If you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize, then it would be possible.

The failed Monsanto buyout caused Syngenta shares to increase by nearly 40%.  In February 2016, [[ChemChina]], a Chinese [[state-owned enterprise]], offered to purchase Syngenta for $43 billion (480 Swiss francs per share), a deal which the company "unanimously recommended to shareholders”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ChemChina offers to buy Syngenta for $43bn|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-35480393|accessdate=8 April 2017|work=[[BBC News]]|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2017, the [[Federal Trade Commission]], the [[Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States]], and the [[European Commissioner for Competition]] approved of the acquisition, allowing the largest foreign takeover in Chinese history to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tsang|first1=Amie|title=Deal's Approval Buoys China in Its Quest for Food Security|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/syngenta-chemchina-takeover.html|accessdate=8 April 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=6 April 2017|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To secure approval, ChemChina agreed to divest from pesticide production of [[paraquat]], [[abamectin]], and [[chlorothalonil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FTC Requires China National Chemical Corporation and Syngenta AG to Divest U.S. Assets as a Condition of Merger|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/04/ftc-requires-china-national-chemical-corporation-syngenta-ag|accessdate=8 April 2017|agency=[[Federal Trade Commission]]|date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mergers: Commission clears ChemChina acquisition of Syngenta, subject to conditions|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-882_en.htm|accessdate=8 April 2017|agency=[[European Commission]]|date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an additional condition for the acquisition, 67 percent of the shareholders of Syngenta had to offer their shares to ChemChina.

===Former products===
Syngenta's predecessor, Ciba-Geigy, introduced the insecticide Galecron [[chlordimeform]] in 1966, and it was removed from the market in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization [http://apps.who.int/bookorders/anglais/detart1.jsp?codlan=1&amp;codcol=16&amp;codcch=199# Chlordimeform] Environmental Health Criteria, No 199. {{ISBN|9789241571999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1976, Ciba-Geigy told regulatory authorities that it was temporarily withdrawing chlordimeform because ongoing long-term toxicology studies - particularly studies to determine if long-term exposure could cause cancer - showed that it was causing cancer, and that it has already started to monitor its workers' exposure and had found chlordimeform and its metabolites in the urine of its workers.&lt;ref name=ReReg&gt;Environmental Protection Agency Office Of Pesticide Programs Case Number 0141 [http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/93000PJA.PDF?ZyActionP=PDF&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1981%20Thru%201985&amp;File=D%3A%5CZYFILES%5CINDEX%20DATA%5C81THRU85%5CTXT%5C00000024%5C93000PJA.txt&amp;Query=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;QField=&amp;UseQField=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;Docs= Guidance for the Reregistration Of Pesticide Products Containing Chlordimeform or Chlordimeform Hydrochloride As Active Ingredients 059701 and 059702]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8–9}}
Ciba-Geigy then applied for, and was granted, permission to market Galecron at lower doses for use only on cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/jmpr/jmpmono/v078pr07.htm |title=431. Chlordimeform (Pesticide residues in food: 1978 evaluations) |publisher=Inchem.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as further long term monitoring data was obtained, regulators banned chlordimeform in 1988.  In a 1995 class action in the US, Ciba-Geigy agreed to cover costs for employee health monitoring and treatment. In 2005, Syngenta reported that employee health monitoring was continuing at the company's Monthey, Switzerland site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.syngenta.com/en/downloads/050512_Galecron_en.pdf |title=Syngenta Global Website – Bringing plant potential to life |publisher=.syngenta.com |date=2013-12-17 |accessdate=2014-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929134843/http://www.syngenta.com/en/downloads/050512_Galecron_en.pdf |archivedate=29 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biofuels===
Like many agriculture companies, Syngenta also works in the [[biofuel]] space. In 2011, it announced the corn trait ENOGEN to reduce substantially the consumption of water and energy versus conventional corn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/12/business/12corn.html?_r=0 |title=U.S. Approves Corn Modified for Ethanol |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2011-02-11 |accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[ethanol]] producers plan to process such improved corn.&lt;ref name=2013results/&gt; For example, Syngenta has signed a commercial agreement with Three Rivers Energy, LLC of Coshocton, Ohio, US to use grain featuring Enogen trait technology following the 2014 corn harvest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.agropages.com/News/NewsDetail---11065.htm Syngenta and Three Rivers Energy signed Enogen® trait technology agreement]. AgroPages, 26 Nov. 2013. Retrieved 2014-5-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Queensland University in Australia contracted with Syngenta to research different inputs for biofuels as a renewable energy source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.cleantech.com/1965/syngenta-queensland-university-in-biofuel-research|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070801171634/http://media.cleantech.com/1965/syngenta-queensland-university-in-biofuel-research|deadurl=yes|title=Syngenta in Australian biofuel research - Cleantech.com|author=|date=1 August 2007|archivedate=1 August 2007|website=cleantech.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate structure==

==Litigation==
In 2001, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] ruled in favor of Syngenta which had filed a suit against Bayer for patent infringement on a class of [[neonicotinoid]] insecticides. The following year Syngenta filed suits against Monsanto and other companies claiming infringement of its U.S. biotechnology patents covering [[genetically modified crops|genetically modified]] corn and cotton. In 2004, it again filed a suit against Monsanto, claiming antitrust violations related to the U.S. biotech corn seed market, and Monsanto countersued. Monsanto and Syngenta settled all litigation in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentdocs.org/2008/05/monsanto-and-sy.html |title=Monsanto and Syngenta Settle All Litigation Between the Companies |publisher=Patent Docs |date=2008-05-30 |accessdate=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syngenta was defendant in a class action lawsuit by the city of [[Greenville, Illinois]] concerning the adverse effects of [[atrazine]] in human water supplies. The suit was settled for $105 million in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atrazinesettlement.com/ City of Greenville v.

The plaintiffs  in nearly 30 states contend that Syngenta's introduction of Viptera drove down US grain market prices, leading to financial harm, and that Syngenta acted irresponsibly by doing too little to enable shipping companies to export the grain to approved ports.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agriculture.com/crops/corn/technology/syngenta-speaks-out-about-viptera_139-ar45942 |title=Syngenta Speaks Out About Viptera, Duracade Launch |publisher=Agriculture.Com |date=2014-10-31 |accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Viptera's 2010 introduction Syngenta secured all US and [[National Corn Growers Association|NCGA]]-recommended export approvals, but none from China. China had imported little to no US grain prior to 2010, and at the time was not considered a major partner, but it became a major partner in 2010, when it dramatically increased US grain imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.fas.usda.gov/esrquery/esrq.aspx |title=USDA Export Sales Reporting System |date=2015-09-04 |accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; For three years, China imported U.S. Viptera grain without formal approval. In November 2013, Chinese officials destroyed a U.S. grain shipment containing Viptera grain, started rejecting all US shipments with the GM grain, but continued to accept it from all countries other than the US.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; That same year, US corn market prices dropped $4 per bushel, causing over $2.9B in losses, with just over half of that loss occurring prior to China's November rejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/datafiles/Feed_Grains_Yearbook_Tables/Domestic_and_International_Prices/FGYearbookTable09.xls |title=Table 9--Corn and sorghum: Average prices received by farmers, United States |publisher=USDA |date=2015-08-17 |accessdate=2015-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922021559/http://www.ers.usda.gov/datafiles/Feed_Grains_Yearbook_Tables/Domestic_and_International_Prices/FGYearbookTable09.xls |archivedate=22 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; China later approved the GM corn in 2014 but US corn grain market prices have not rebounded.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Syngenta lost the first lawsuit to reach trial, in [[Kansas]] on June 23, 2017, and was ordered to pay the farmers $217 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cronin Fisk|first1=Margaret|last2=Bross|first2=Tim|title=Syngenta Loses $218 Million Verdict in First GMO Trial Test|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-23/syngenta-ordered-by-jury-to-pay-218-million-to-kansas-farmers|accessdate=23 June 2017|publisher=Bloomberg|date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Syngenta has stated it would appeal the verdict.

==Controversies==
===Brazil===
On 21 October 2007, a Brazilian peasant organization, the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] ({{lang-pt|Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra - MST}}), led a group of landless farmers in an occupation of one of the company's seed research farms, in protest against genetically-engineered ("genetically modified") vegetables and in hopes of obtaining land for landless families to cultivate. After the occupation had begun, a team from NF Security arrived in a minibus and a fight with gunfire ensued. A protestor and a security guard were killed,  and some protesters and security guards were wounded.&lt;ref name="The Independant"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Doyle |first=Leonard |title=Brazilian land activist killed in dispute over experimental GM farm |journal=The Independent |date=5 November 2007 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/brazilian-land-activist-killed-in-dispute-over-experimental-gm-farm-399021.html |accessdate=2013-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brazilian police investigation completed in November 2007 blamed the confrontation and death of the protestor on nine employees and the owner of NF Security; the leader of MST was blamed for trespassing.  The inquiry found that the protester was fatally shot in the abdomen and in the leg. The security guard was shot in the head. Eight others were injured, five of them landless.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Portela for CONTAG (Confederação Nacional dos Trabalhadores na Agricultura) Press Office. 21 November 2007 [http://www.contag.org.br/indexdet.php?modulo=portal&amp;acao=interna2&amp;codpag=101&amp;id=1669&amp;mt=1&amp;pt=1 Polícia indicia seguranças por morte] [http://www.contag.org.br/indexdet.php?modulo=portal&amp;acao=interna2&amp;codpag=101&amp;id=1669&amp;mt=1&amp;pt=1 English translation via Google]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Court case'''

In November 2015, Judge Pedro Ivo Moreiro, of the 1st Civil Court of Cascavel, ruled that Syngenta must pay compensation to the family of Valmir Mota de Oliveira ("Keno"), who was killed in the attack, and to Isabel Nascimento dos Santos who was injured.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://viacampesina.org/en/index.php/main-issues-mainmenu-27/human-rights-mainmenu-40/1901-syngenta-convicted-in-brazil |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121032233/http://viacampesina.org/en/index.php/main-issues-mainmenu-27/human-rights-mainmenu-40/1901-syngenta-convicted-in-brazil |archivedate=21 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terradedireitos.org.br/2015/11/18/syngenta-condenada-justica-responsabiliza-empresa-morte-de-sem-terra-no-parana/|title=Syngenta condenada: Justiça responsabiliza empresa por morte de sem terra no Paraná|first=Terra de|last=Direitos|date=|website=terradedireitos.org.br|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his sentence the judge stated that "to refer to what happened as a confrontation is to close one’s eyes to reality, since […] there is no doubt that, in truth, it was a massacre disguised as repossession of property".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The version of events put forward by Syngenta was rejected by the Court.

===Conflict with Tyrone Hayes===
There has been a long running conflict between Syngenta and  [[University of California at Berkeley]] biologist [[Tyrone Hayes]].

According to an article in the 10 February 2014, issue of ''The New Yorker,'' Syngenta's public-relations team took steps to discredit Hayes, whose research is purported to suggest that the Syngenta-produced chemical [[atrazine]] was responsible for abnormal development of reproductive organs in frogs.  The article states that the company paid third-party critics to write articles discrediting Hayes's work, planned to have his wife investigated, and planted hostile audience members at scientific talks given by Hayes.&lt;ref name=Aviv&gt;Rachel Aviv for The New Yorker.  10 February 2014. [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/02/10/140210fa_fact_aviv?currentPage=all A Valuable Reputation]&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 21 February 2014 interview conducted on ''[[Democracy Now]]'', Hayes reiterated the claims.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Gonzalez and Amy Goodman for Democracy Now.  21 February 2014. [http://www.democracynow.org/2014/2/21/silencing_the_scientist_tyrone_hayes_on Silencing the Scientist: Tyrone Hayes on Being Targeted by Herbicide Firm Syngenta]&lt;/ref&gt; After the interview aired, Syngenta denied targeting Hayes or making any threats, calling those statements "uncorroborated and intentionally damaging" and demanding a retraction and public apology from Hayes and ''Democracy Now''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.atrazine.com/news_releases/news.aspx?id=180179 |title=Syngenta Defends Senior Scientist |publisher=Syngenta.com |date=2014-03-07 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Syngenta forwarded an ethics complaint to the University of California Berkeley, complaining that Hayes had been sending sexually explicit and harassing e-mails to Syngenta scientists.  Legal counsel from the university responded that Hayes had acknowledged sending letters having "unprofessional and offensive" content, and that he had agreed not to use similar language in future communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100818/full/466913a.html|title=E-mails spark ethics row|work=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atrazine.com/Amphibians/Univ_of_CA-7-19-10.pdf |title=www.atrazine.com |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue has been described as "one of the weirdest feuds in the history of science”, by Dashka Slater in her 2012 profile of Hayes in Mother Jones magazine.&lt;ref name="Mother Jones 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Slater | first1 = Dashka | title = The Frog of War | work = Mother Jones | date=January–February 2012 | url = http://motherjones.com/environment/2011/11/tyrone-hayes-atrazine-syngenta-feud-frog-endangered }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thermization''', also spelled '''thermisation''', is a method of sanitizing [[raw milk]] with low heat. "Thermization is a generic description of a range of subpasteurization heat treatments (57 to 68°C × 10 to 20 s) that markedly reduce the number of spoilage bacteria in milk with minimal heat damage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(07)72607-3 |pmid=17183074 |title=Lipolysis in Cheddar Cheese Made from Raw, Thermized, and Pasteurized Milks |journal=Journal of Dairy Science |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=47–56 |year=2007 |last1=Hickey |first1=D.K. |last2=Kilcawley |first2=K.N. |last3=Beresford |first3=T.P. |last4=Wilkinson |first4=M.G. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is not used on other food products,&lt;ref name="Brennan" /&gt; and is similar to [[pasteurization]] but uses lower temperatures, allowing the milk product to retain more of its original taste.&lt;ref name="MV Voice"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mv-voice.com/morgue/2003/2003_09_05.dinea.html|title=Keeping it raw|date=September 5, 2003|last=Rich|first=Robert|publisher=Embarcadero Publishing Company|work=The Mountain View Voice|accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, there is a distinction between cheeses made of thermized milk and raw-milk cheeses. However, the United States' [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) places the same regulations on all unpasteurized cheeses. As a result, cheeses from thermized milk must be aged for 60 days or more before being sold in the United States, the same restriction placed on raw-milk cheeses by the FDA.&lt;ref name="SF Gate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-07-13/wine/17304107_1_blue-cheese-milk-cheese-sheep-s-milk|title=Wisconsin's Buttermilk Blue adds pizazz to summer salads|last=Fletcher|first=Janet|date=July 13, 2006|publisher=Hearst Communications Inc|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermization involves heating milk at temperatures of around {{convert|145|-|149|F|C}} for 15 seconds, while pasteurization involves heating milk at {{convert|160|F|C}} for 15 seconds or at {{convert|145|F|C}} for 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="MV Voice" /&gt; Thermization is used to extend the keeping quality of raw milk (the length of time that milk is suitable for consumption)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/40/2/373.full.pdf|title=A method for the determination of the keeping quality of milk|last1=Baker|first1=John C.|last2=Van Slyke|first2=Lucius L.|date=December 1, 1919|journal=[[Journal of Biological Chemistry|The Journal of Biological Chemistry]]|volume=40|issue=2|pages=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it cannot be immediately used in other products, such as cheese.

When the milk is first heated, spores can begin to germinate, but their growth can be halted or delayed when the milk is refrigerated, depending on the microorganisms' growth requirements. Germinated spores are sensitive to subsequent heating, however since germination is not a homogeneous process, not all spores will germinate or be inactivated by subsequent heating.

'''Valenbisi''' is the name of a [[bicycle sharing system]] in [[Valencia]] inaugurated on June 21, 2010. It is similar to the [[Vélo'v]] service in [[Lyon]] or [[Vélib']] in [[Paris]], and using the same bicycles and stations as used in [[dublinbikes|Dublin]], [[Vienna]], and [[Villo!|Brussels]]. Its purpose is to cover the small and medium daily routes within the city in a [[Sustainable transport|climate-friendly]] way, eliminating the pollution, [[roadway noise]], and [[traffic congestion]] that motor vehicles create.
[[File:Valenbisi a la plaça de Tetuan de València.JPG|right|thumb|A Valenbisi station]]

==Operation==
The city council and [[JCDecaux]] manage and maintain the system. To use it, users must acquire a yearly membership. Currently the network consists of more than 275 stations to lend and return over 2750 bicycles distributed throughout the system.&lt;ref name="stats" /&gt; The stations are situated through most of the flat areas of the city with a distance of around 300 to 400 metres between each one, with many situated next to public transport stops to allow for [[Intermodal passenger transport|intermodal use]]. [[Metrovalencia|Metro]] Stations usually have signs pointing to the locations of nearest Valenbisi stations.
The bikes can be lent from, and returned to, any station in the system, making it suitable for one-way travel. Each station has between 15 and 30 parking slots to fix and lock bicycles, but in highly transited areas many stations may be close together.

==Subscription==
Use of the system is based on membership, and users can subscribe online or by visiting a service office. The Valenbisi member cards are only sent to addresses in Valencia in an attempt to prevent tourists from using the system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.valenbisi.es/Abonate&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stations==
Bike stations have generally replaced on-street car or motorcycle parking spaces, though others were placed on large pedestrian areas. Each station includes a long series of docks for bikes, with a computerized pylon at one end for completing transactions.

==Financing==
The system is paid for mostly by local car drivers with an [[Coupon parking|on-street parking control]] system, distributed throughout much of the densely populated inner city. This money, about €1 million annually, is paid to the system operator. The yearly user fee is €29,12.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21991">'''Vehicular ad hoc networks''' ('''VANETs''') are created by applying the principles of [[mobile ad hoc network]]s (MANETs) – the spontaneous creation of a wireless network for '''Vehicle-to-vehicle''' ('''V2V''') data exchange – to the domain of vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Morteza_Mohammadi_Zanjireh/publication/274638337_A_Survey_on_Centralised_and_Distributed_Clustering_Routing_Algorithms_for_WSNs/links/552444b80cf2b123c5173968.pdf|title=A Survey on Centralised and Distributed Clustering Routing Algorithms for WSNs|doi=10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145650|conference=IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference|location=Glasgow, Scotland|date= May 2015|author1=Morteza Mohammadi Zanjireh|author2=Hadi Larijani}}&lt;/ref&gt; VANETs were first mentioned and introduced &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Ad_Hoc_Mobile_Wireless_Networks.html?id=9fUchlgTXDQC&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Ad Hoc Mobile Wireless Networks: Protocols and Systems, Prentice Hall, 2001.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001 under "[[Vehicular communication systems|car-to-car]] ad hoc mobile communication and networking" applications, where networks can be formed and information can be relayed among cars. It was shown that vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside communications architectures will co-exist in VANETs to provide [[road safety]], navigation, and other roadside services. 
VANETs are a key part of the [[intelligent transportation systems]] (ITS) framework. Sometimes, VANETs are referred as Intelligent Transportation Networks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://networking.ifip.org/2008/Keynote.html |title=Research Challenges in Intelligent Transportation Networks, IFIP Keynote, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While, in the early 2000s, VANETs were seen as a mere one-to-one application of MANET principles, they have since then developed into a field of research in their own right. By 2015,&lt;ref name="textbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sommer|first1=Christoph|last2=Dressler|first2=Falko|title=Vehicular Networking|date=December 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107046719}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=3}} the term VANET became mostly synonymous with the more generic term '''inter-vehicle communication''' ('''IVC'''), although the focus remains on the aspect of spontaneous networking, much less on the use of infrastructure like Road Side Units (RSUs) or cellular networks.

==Applications==
VANETs support a wide range of applications – from simple one hop information dissemination of, e.g., cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to multi-hop dissemination of messages over vast distances.
Most of the concerns of interest to [[mobile ad hoc network]]s (MANETs) are of interest in VANETs, but the details differ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Comparative study of MANET and VANET Environment|journal=Journal of Computing|date=July 2010|volume=2|issue=7|url=http://zh.scribd.com/doc/34832829/A-Comparative-study-of-MANET-and-VANET-Environment|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than moving at random, vehicles tend to move in an organized fashion. The interactions with roadside equipment can likewise be characterized fairly accurately. And finally, most vehicles are restricted in their range of motion, for example by being constrained to follow a paved highway.

Example applications of VANETs are:&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;{{rp|page=56}}
* '''Electronic brake lights''', which allow a driver (or an [[autonomous car]] or truck) to react to vehicles braking even though they might be obscured (e.g., by other vehicles).
* '''[[Platoon (automobile)|Platooning]]''', which allows vehicles to closely (down to a few inches) follow a leading vehicle by wirelessly receiving acceleration and steering information, thus forming electronically coupled "road trains".
* '''[[Traffic information]] systems''', which use VANET communication to provide up-to-the minute obstacle reports to a vehicle's [[satellite navigation system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obstacle Management in VANET using Game Theory and Fuzzy Logic Control|journal=International Journal on Communication|date=June 2013|volume=4|issue=1|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/197580468/Obstacle-Management-in-VANET-using-Game-Theory-and-Fuzzy-Logic-Control|accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Road Transportation Emergency Services'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5609617/ |title=Emergency Services in Future Intelligent Transportation Systems Based on Vehicular Communication Networks - F. Martinez, C. Toh, Juan Carlos, et. al, IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems, Vol 2 No 2, 2010.}}&lt;/ref&gt; – where VANET communications, VANET networks, and road safety warning and status information dissemination are used to reduce delays and speed up emergency rescue operations to save the lives of those injured.  
* '''On-The-Road Services'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4426272/ |title=Future Application Scenarios for MANET-Based Intelligent Transportation Systems - C. Toh, IEEE Future Generation Communication and Networking, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; – it is also envisioned that the future transportation highway would be "information-driven" or "wirelessly-enabled". VANETs can help advertise services (shops, gas stations, restaurants, etc.) to the driver, and even send notifications of any sale going on at that moment.

==Technology==
VANETs can use any wireless networking technology as their basis. The most prominent are short range radio technologies&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;{{rp|page=118}} like [[WLAN]] (either standard [[Wi-Fi]] or [[ZigBee]]). In addition, cellular technologies or [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] can be used for VANETs. The latest technology for this wireless networking is [[visible light communication]] [VLC] (Infrared transmission and reception).

==Simulations==
Prior to the implementation of VANETs on the roads, realistic [[computer simulation]]s of VANETs using a combination of Urban Mobility simulation and [[Network simulation]] are necessary. Typically open source simulator like SUMO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Downloads - Simulation of Urban Mobility | website=SUMO | date=2018-08-20 | url=http://www.sumo.dlr.de/userdoc/Downloads.html | ref={{sfnref | SUMO | 2018}} | access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which handles road traffic simulation) is combined with a network simulator like [https://tetcos.com/vanets.html TETCOS NetSim]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Tetcos | title=NetSim Academic | website=NetSim-Network Simulator &amp; Emulator | url=https://www.tetcos.com/netsim-std.html | ref=harv | access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or NS-2 to study the performance of VANETs.

==Standards==
Major standardization of VANET protocol stacks is taking place in the U.S., in Europe, and in Japan, corresponding to their dominance in the [[automotive industry]].&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;{{rp|page=5}}

In the U.S., the IEEE 1609 WAVE Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments protocol stack builds on [[IEEE 802.11p]] WLAN operating on seven reserved channels in the 5.9&amp;nbsp;GHz frequency band.
The WAVE protocol stack is designed to provide multi-channel operation (even for vehicles equipped with only a single radio), security, and lightweight [[application layer]] protocols.
Within the [[IEEE Communications Society]], there is a Technical Subcommittee on Vehicular Networks &amp; Telematics Applications (VNTA). The charter of this committee is to actively promote technical activities in the field of vehicular networks, V2V, V2R and V2I communications, standards, communications-enabled road and vehicle safety, real-time [[traffic monitoring]], intersection management technologies, future [[telematics]] applications, and [[Intelligent transportation system|ITS]]-based services.

==Radio frequencies==
In the US, the systems will use a region of the 5.9&amp;nbsp;GHz band set aside by the United States Congress, the unlicensed frequency also used by [[Wi-Fi]]. The US V2V standard, commonly known as WAVE ("Wireless Access for Vehicular Environments"), builds upon the lower-level [[IEEE 802.11p]] standard, as early as 2004.

The European Commission Decision 2008/671/EC harmonises the use of the 5 875-5 905&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency band for transport safety ITS applications.&lt;ref&gt;Commission Decision 2008/671/EC "on the harmonised use of radio spectrum in the 5 875-5 905 MHz frequency band for safety-related applications of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)" (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32008D0671)&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe V2V is standardised as ETSI ITS,&lt;ref&gt;EN 302 663 Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS); Access layer specification for Intelligent Transport Systems operating in the 5 GHz frequency band (http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/302600_302699/302663/01.02.00_20/en_302663v010200a.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; a standard also based on [[IEEE 802.11p]]. C-ITS, cooperative ITS, is also a term used in EU policy making, closely linked to ITS-G5 and V2V.

V2V is also known as VANET ([[vehicular ad hoc network]]). It is a variation of MANET ([[Mobile ad hoc network]]), with the emphasis being now the node is the vehicle. In 2001, it was mentioned in a publication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9fUchlgTXDQC | title=Ad Hoc Mobile Wireless Networks: Protocols and Systems | publisher=Pearson Education | author=Chai K Toh | year=2001 | isbn=9780132442046}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ad hoc networks can be formed by cars and such networks can help overcome blind spots, avoid accidents, etc. The infrastructure also participates in such systems, then referred to as [[Vehicle-to-everything|V2X]] (vehicle-to-everything). Over the years, there have been considerable research and projects in this area, applying VANETs for a variety of applications, ranging from safety to
navigation and law enforcement.

In 1999 the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allocated 75&amp;nbsp;MHz in the spectrum of 5.850-5.925&amp;nbsp;GHz for intelligent transport systems.

===Conflict over spectrum===
As of 2016, V2V is under threat from cable television and other tech firms that want to take away a big chunk of the radio spectrum currently reserved for it and use those frequencies for high-speed internet service. V2V's current share of spectrum was set aside by the government in 1999. The auto industry is trying to retain all it can saying that it desperately needs the spectrum for V2V. The Federal Communications Commission has taken the side of the tech companies with the National Traffic Safety Board supporting the position of the auto industry. Internet service providers who want the spectrum claim that self-driving cars will make extensive use of V2V unnecessary. The auto industry said it is willing to share the spectrum if V2V service is not slowed or disrupted; the FCC plans to test several sharing schemes.&lt;ref name="Times1"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-talking-cars-20160825-snap-story.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Research in VANETs started as early as 2000, in universities and research labs, having evolved from researchers working on wireless ad hoc networks. Many have worked on media access protocols, routing, warning message dissemination, and VANET application scenarios. V2V is currently in active development by [[General Motors]], which demonstrated the system in 2006 using Cadillac vehicles. Other automakers working on V2V include [[Toyota]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.toyota.co.jp/en/detail/4228471/|title=Toyota to Bring Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative Systems to New Models in 2015 {{!}} TOYOTA Global Newsroom|last=CORPORATION.|first=TOYOTA MOTOR|website=newsroom.toyota.co.jp|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BMW]], [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], [[Honda]], [[Audi]], [[Volvo]] and the Car-to-Car communication consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.car-to-car.org/index.php?id=8|title=Car 2 Car - Communication Consortium: Technical Approach|website=www.car-to-car.org|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
Since then the [[United States Department of Transportation]] (USDOT) has been working with a range of stakeholders on [[Vehicle-to-everything|V2X]]. In 2012 a pre-deployment project was implemented in [[Ann Arbor]], Michigan. 2800 vehicles covering cars, motorcycles, buses and HGV of different brands took part using equipment by different manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;Safety Pilot Model Deployment Technical Fact Sheet (http://www.safercar.gov/staticfiles/safercar/connected/Technical_Fact_Sheet-Model_Deployment.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) saw this model deployment as proof that road safety could be improved and that WAVE standard technology was interoperable. In August 2014 NHTSA published a report arguing vehicle-to-vehicle technology was technically proven as ready for deployment.&lt;ref&gt;NHTSA: Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications: Readiness of V2V Technology for Application (http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/rulemaking/pdf/V2V/Readiness-of-V2V-Technology-for-Application-812014.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014 it was reported that U.S. regulators were close to approving V2V standards for the U.S. market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/vehicles-may-soon-be-talking-to-each-other-/1886895.html|title=Vehicles May Soon Be Talking to Each Other|website=VOA|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 August 2014 the NHTSA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) in the Federal Register,&lt;ref&gt;Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communications, Docket No. NHTSA–2014–0022 (http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/rulemaking/pdf/V2V/V2V-ANPRM_081514.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that the safety benefits of [[Vehicle-to-everything|V2X]] communication could only be achieved, if a significant part of the vehicles fleet was equipped. Because of the lacking immediate benefit for early adopters the NHTSA proposed a mandatory introduction. On 25 June 2015 the US House of Representatives held a hearing on the matter, where again the NHTSA, as well as other stakeholders argued the case for [[Vehicle-to-everything|V2X]].&lt;ref&gt;Hearing in the House of Representatives (Protocol) (https://energycommerce.house.gov/hearings-and-votes/hearings/vehicle-vehicle-communications-and-connected-roadways-future)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the EU the ITS Directive 2010/40/EU&lt;ref&gt;[[# ftnref1|[1]]] Directive 2010/40/EU on the framework for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32010L0040)&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted in 2010. It aims to assure that ITS applications are interoperable and can operate across national borders, it defines priority areas for secondary legislation, which cover V2X and requires technologies to be mature.

[[File:Wedge-1.jpg|thumb|A wood splitting wedge]]  

A '''wedge''' is a [[triangle|triangular]] shaped tool, and is a portable [[inclined plane]], and one of the six classical [[simple machine]]s. It can be used to separate two objects or portions of an object, lift up an object, or hold an object in place.  It functions by converting a [[force]] applied to its blunt end into forces perpendicular ([[Surface normal|normal]]) to its inclined surfaces. &lt;!-- this link is broken &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Wedges and screws | url = http://em-ntserver.unl.edu/Negahban/em223/note16/note16.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; The [[mechanical advantage]] of a wedge is given by the ratio of the length of its slope to its width.&lt;ref name="bowser"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bowser | first = Edward Albert | title = An elementary treatise on analytic mechanics: with numerous examples | publisher = D.

Parker, ed., McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1992, p. 2041.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a short wedge with a wide angle may do a job faster, it requires more force than a long wedge with a narrow angle.

==History==

[[Image:Flint hand axe.JPG|thumb|left|120px|Flint hand axe found in [[Winchester]]]]
Perhaps the first example of a wedge is the [[hand axe]], also see [[biface]] and [[Olorgesailie]]. Wedges have been around for thousands of years, they were first made of simple stone. A hand axe is made by chipping stone, generally [[flint]], to form a bifacial edge, or wedge.  A wedge is a simple machine that transforms lateral force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting force and movement of the workpiece.  The available power is limited by the effort of the person using the tool, but because power is the product of force and movement, the wedge amplifies the force by reducing the movement.  This amplification, or [[mechanical advantage]] is the ratio of the input speed to output speed.  For a wedge this is given by 1/tanα, where α is the tip angle.  The faces of a wedge are modeled as straight lines to form a sliding or [[prismatic joint]].

The origin of the wedge is not known. In [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[quarry|quarries]], [[bronze]] wedges were used to break away blocks of stone used in construction. [[Wood]]en wedges that swelled after being saturated with water, were also used. Some [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] used [[antler]] wedges for splitting and working wood to make [[canoes]], dwellings and other objects.

==Use of a wedge ==
Wedges are used to lift heavy objects, separating them from the surface upon which they rest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m5DK0FSuqysC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;lpg=PA321&amp;dq=“Kinematic+Synthesis,”+Formal+Engineering+Design+Synthesis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AZKlvmnPcA&amp;sig=xe0EeLgCy8v4OIdZ_SnbK8igdrc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qcbVTsyEKo6FsAL1vsCRDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  J. M. McCarthy and Leo Joskowitz, “Kinematic Synthesis,” Formal Engineering Design Synthesis, (J. Cagan and E. Antonson, eds.), Cambridge Univ. Press, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider a block that is to be lifted by a wedge.  As the wedge slides under the block, the block slides up the sloped side of a wedge.  This lifts the weight ''F''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; of the block.  The horizontal force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; needed to lift the block is obtained by considering the velocity of the wedge ''v''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and the velocity of the block ''v''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;.  If we assume the wedge does not dissipate or store energy, then the power into the wedge equals the power out.

or
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{F_\mathrm{B}}{F_\mathrm{A}} = \frac{v_\mathrm{A}}{v_\mathrm{B}}. &lt;/math&gt;
The velocity of the block is related to the velocity of the wedge by the slope of the side of the wedge.  If the angle of the wedge is ''α'' then
:&lt;math&gt; v_\mathrm{B} = v_\mathrm{A} \tan\alpha, \!&lt;/math&gt;
which means that the mechanical advantage
:&lt;math&gt; MA = \frac{F_\mathrm{B}}{F_\mathrm{A}} = \frac{1}{\tan\alpha}. &lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the smaller the angle ''α'' the greater the ratio of the lifting force to the applied force on the wedge.  This is the [[mechanical advantage]] of the wedge.  This formula for mechanical advantage applies to cutting edges and splitting operations as well as to lifting.

They can also be used to separate objects, such as blocks of cut stone. [[Splitting maul]]s and splitting wedges are used to split wood along the grain. A narrow wedge with a relatively long [[Cone|taper]] used to finely adjust the distance between objects is called a [[shim (engineering)|shim]], and is commonly used in carpentry.

The tips of forks and [[nail (engineering)|nails]] are also wedges, as they split and separate the material into which they are pushed or driven; the shafts may then hold fast due to friction.

==Blades and wedges==
The [[blade]] is a compound inclined plane, consisting of two inclined planes placed so that the planes meet at one edge. When the edge where the two planes meet is pushed into a solid or fluid substance it overcomes the resistance of materials to separate by transferring the force exerted against the material into two opposing forces normal to the faces of the blade.

The blade's first known use by humans was the sharp edge of a [[Flint|flint stone]] that was used to cleave or split animal tissue, e.g. cutting meat. The use of [[iron]] or other metals led to the development of [[Knife|knives]] for those kinds of tasks. The blade of the knife allowed humans to cut meat, fibers, and other plant and animal materials with much less force than it would take to tear them apart by simply pulling with their hands. Other examples are [[plows]], which separate soil particles, [[scissors]] which separate fabric, [[axe]]s which separate wood fibers, and [[chisels]] and [[plane (tool)|planes]]  which separate wood.

Wedges, [[saw]]s and [[chisels]] can separate thick and hard materials, such as wood, solid stone and hard metals and they do so with much less force, waste of material, and with more precision, than [[crusher|crushing]], which is the application of the same force over a wider area of the material to be separated.

Other examples of wedges are found in [[drill bit]]s, which  produce circular holes in solids. The two edges of a drill bit are sharpened, at opposing angles,  into a point and that edge is wound around the shaft of the drill bit. When the drill bit spins on its axis of rotation, the wedges are forced into the material to be separated. The resulting cut in the material is in the direction of rotation of the drill bit while the helical shape of a bit allows the removal of the cut material.

==Examples for holding fast==
Wedges can also be used to hold objects in place, such as [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] parts ([[poppet valve]]s), [[bicycle]] parts ([[Stem (bicycle part)|stem]]s and [[Eccentric (mechanism)|eccentric]] [[bottom bracket]]s), and [[door]]s. A wedge-type [[door wedge|door stop]] (door wedge) functions largely because of the friction generated between the bottom of the door and the wedge, and the wedge and the floor (or other surface).

== Mechanical advantage ==
[[Image:Wedge-diagram.svg|thumb|100px|Cross-section of a splitting wedge with its length oriented vertically. A downward force produces forces perpendicular to its inclined surfaces.]]

The mechanical advantage of a wedge can be calculated by dividing the height of the wedge by the wedge's width:&lt;ref name="bowser"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rm Mechanical  Advantage={Length \over Width}&lt;/math&gt;

The more [[acute angle|acute]], or narrow, the angle of a wedge, the greater the ratio of the length of its slope to its width, and thus the more mechanical advantage it will yield.&lt;ref name="CEST"/&gt;

However, in an elastic material such as wood, friction may bind a narrow wedge more easily than a wide one. This is why the head of a splitting maul has a much wider angle than that of an axe.

'''Yuchanyan''' is an early [[Neolithic China|Neolithic]] cave site in [[Dao County]] (Daoxian), [[Hunan]], China. The site yielded [[sherd]]s of ceramic vessels and other artifacts which were dated by analysis of charcoal and bone collagen, giving a date range of 17,500 to 18,300 years old for the pottery.&lt;ref name="Boaretto"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2009 |title=Radiocarbon dating of charcoal and bone collagen associated with early pottery at Yuchanyan Cave, Hunan Province, China |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=106 |issue=24 |pages=9537–9538| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/24/9595.full |doi=10.1073/pnas.0900539106 |author=Boaretto, E. |displayauthors=1 |bibcode=2009PNAS..106.9595B |last2=Yuan |first2=J. |last3=Bar-Yosef |first3=O. |last4=Chu |first4=V. |last5=Pan |first5=Y. |last6=Liu |first6=K. |last7=Cohen |first7=D. |last8=Jiao |first8=T. |last9=Li |first9=S. |last10=Gu |first10=H. |last11=Goldberg |first11=P. |last12=Weiner |first12=S. |pmid=19487667 |pmc=2689310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pottery specimens may be the oldest known examples of pottery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8077168.stm 'Oldest pottery' found in China]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cave yielded fragmentary remains of 2 or more ceramic vessels, in addition to large amounts of ash, a rich animal bone assemblage, cobble and flake artifacts, bone tools, and shell tools. The artifacts indicate that the cave was a Late Paleolithic foragers' camp. Here we report on the radiocarbon ages of the sediments based on analyses of charcoal and bone collagen. The best-preserved charcoal and bone samples were identified by prescreening in the field and laboratory. The dates range from around 21,000 to 13,800 cal BP.  The age of the ancient pottery ranges between 18,300 and 15,430 cal BP. Charcoal and bone collagen samples located above and below one of the fragments produced dates of around 18,000. These ceramic potsherds therefore provide some of the earliest evidence for pottery making in China.
