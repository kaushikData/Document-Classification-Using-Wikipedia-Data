      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1466">'''Abdur Raqib''' ({{lang-ar| عبد الرقيب }}) is a male Muslim given name. It is built from the Arabic words ''[[Abd (Arabic)|Abd]]'', ''[[al-]]'' and ''Raqib''. The name means "servant of the observer", ''Ar-Raqīb'' being one of the [[Names of God in the Qur'an]], which give rise to the [[List of Arabic theophoric names|Muslim theophoric names]].&lt;ref name=ahmed&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author=Salahuddin Ahmed| publisher = Hurst &amp; Company| location=London| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rahman&gt; {{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author= S. A. Rahman| publisher=Goodword Books|  location=New Delhi| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter ''a'' of the ''al-'' is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by ''u''. Because the letter ''r'' is a [[sun and moon letters|sun letter]], the letter ''l'' of the ''al-'' is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to ''Abd al-Raqib'', the usual pronunciation corresponds to ''Abd ar-Raqib''. Alternative transliterations include ''Abdul Raqeeb'' and others, all subject to variable spacing and hyphenation. 

It may refer to:
*[[Abdur Raqib (cricketer)]] (born 1947), Pakistani cricketer
*[[H Abdul Raqeeb]], Indian businessman
*[[Hanif Abdurraqib]], American poet, essayist, and cultural critic

'''Robert Ewing Younger''' (October 29, 1853 – September 16, 1889) was an American criminal and outlaw, the younger brother of [[Cole Younger|Cole]], [[Jim Younger|Jim]] and [[John Younger]]. He was a member of the [[James–Younger Gang]].

==Life==
Born in [[Missouri]] on October 29, 1853, Robert  was the thirteenth of fourteen children born to [[Henry Washington Younger]] and [[Bersheba Leighton Fristoe]]. During the Civil War his brothers Cole and Jim rode with [[Quantrill's Raiders]]. Bob was only 8 when the war broke out in 1861.  He saw his father killed by Union soldiers and his home burned to the ground.

After the war, his brothers formed the James–Younger Gang with [[Frank James|Frank]] and [[Jesse James]]. For ten years the gang robbed banks, trains, and stage coaches across Missouri, Kansas, and other nearby states.  Bob Younger is believed to have first joined the gang in 1873.

In September 1876 the gang attempted to rob the First National Bank in [[Northfield, Minnesota]].  The townspeople decided to fight back, and in the ensuing shootout all three of the Younger brothers were captured.  Bob was wounded in the elbow and later in the chest. Two Northfield citizens were killed in the botched raid.

==Imprisonment and death==
Bob Younger was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.  He died of [[tuberculosis]] in prison at [[Stillwater, Minnesota]] on September 16, 1889, aged 35 years.  His body was shipped to Lee's Summit, Missouri where a funeral was held. He was buried in the Lee's Summit Cemetery.

'''Commodus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|m|ə|d|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/commodus "Commodus"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 31 August 161 – 31 December 192 CE), born '''Lucius Aurelius Commodus'''{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} and died '''Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus''', was [[Roman emperor]] with his father [[Marcus Aurelius]] from 177 to his father's death in 180, and solely until 192.

During his father's reign, he accompanied Marcus Aurelius during the [[Marcomannic Wars]] in 172 and on a tour of the Eastern provinces in 176. He was made the youngest consul in Roman history in 177 and later that year elevated to co-emperor with his father. His accession was the first time a son had succeeded his biological father since [[Titus]] succeeded [[Vespasian]] in 79. He was also the first emperor to have both a father and grandfather (who had adopted his father) as the two preceding emperors. Commodus was the first (and until 337, the only) emperor "[[born in the purple]]", i.e. during his father's reign.

During his solo reign, the Empire enjoyed a period of reduced military conflict compared with the reign of Marcus Aurelius, but intrigues and conspiracies abounded, leading Commodus to an increasingly dictatorial style of leadership that culminated in a God-like personality cult. His assassination in 192 marked the end of the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty]]. He was succeeded by [[Pertinax]], the first emperor in the tumultuous [[Year of the Five Emperors]].

==Early life and rise to power (161–180)==
===Early life===
[[File:Bust of Commodus 180-192 AD.JPG|thumb|left|250px|A bust of Commodus as a youth ([[Roman-Germanic Museum]], Cologne).]]
Commodus was born on 31 August {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}161 in [[Lanuvium]], near [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref name="HA LOC 1"&gt;''Historia Augusta - Life of Commodus'' 1&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of the reigning emperor, Marcus Aurelius, and Aurelius's first cousin, [[Faustina the Younger]], the youngest daughter of [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Antoninus Pius]], who had died only a few months before. Commodus had an elder twin brother, Titus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus, who died in 165. On 12 October 166, Commodus was made [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] together with his younger brother, [[Marcus Annius Verus Caesar|Marcus Annius Verus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'' 12.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David 1"&gt;David L. Vagi ''Coinage and History of the Roman Empire'' Vol. One: History p.248&lt;/ref&gt; The latter died in 169 having failed to recover from an operation, which left Commodus as Marcus Aurelius's sole surviving son.&lt;ref name="David 1"/&gt;

[[File:Marcus Aurelius bust Istanbul Archaeological Museum - inv. 5129 T.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bust of [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the [[Archaeological Museum of Istanbul]], Turkey]]
He was looked after by his father's physician, [[Galen]],&lt;ref name="SPM"&gt;Susan P. Mattern ''The Prince of Medicine: Galen in the Roman Empire'' p. xx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio ''Roman History'' 71.33.1&lt;/ref&gt; who treated many of Commodus' common illnesses. Commodus received extensive tutoring by a multitude of teachers with a focus on intellectual education.&lt;ref name="Birley 197"&gt;Anthony R Birley ''Marcus Aurelius: A Biography'' p.197&lt;/ref&gt; Among his teachers, Onesicrates, Antistius Capella, Titus Aius Sanctus, and Pitholaus are mentioned.&lt;ref name="Birley 197"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'' 1.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Commodus is known to have been at [[Carnuntum]], the headquarters of Marcus Aurelius during the [[Marcomannic Wars]], in 172. It was presumably there that, on 15 October 172, he was given the [[victory title]] ''[[Germanicus (disambiguation)|Germanicus]]'', in the presence of the [[Roman army|army]]. The title suggests that Commodus was present at his father's victory over the [[Marcomanni]]. On 20 January 175, Commodus entered the [[College of Pontiffs]], the starting point of a career in public life.

In April 175, [[Avidius Cassius]], Governor of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], declared himself Emperor following rumours that Marcus Aurelius had died. Having been accepted as Emperor by Syria, [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] and [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], Cassius carried on his rebellion even after it had become obvious that Marcus was still alive. During the preparations for the campaign against Cassius, Commodus assumed his [[toga virilis]] on the [[Danube|Danubian]] front on 7 July 175, thus formally entering [[adulthood]]. Cassius, however, was killed by one of his [[centurion]]s before the campaign against him could begin.

Commodus subsequently accompanied his father on a lengthy trip to the Eastern provinces, during which he visited [[Antioch]]. The Emperor and his son then traveled to [[Athens]], where they were initiated into the [[Eleusinian mysteries]]. They then returned to Rome in the [[autumn]] of 176.

===Joint rule with father (177)===
[[File:L%27Image_et_le_Pouvoir_-_T%C3%AAte_de_Crispine_01.jpg|thumb|200px|Head of Bruttia Crispina]]
Marcus Aurelius was the first emperor since [[Vespasian]] to have a legitimate biological son and, though he himself was the fifth in the line of the so-called [[Five Good Emperors]], each of whom had adopted his successor, it seems to have been his firm intention that Commodus should be his heir. On 27 November 176, Marcus Aurelius granted Commodus the rank of ''[[Imperator]]''  and, in the middle of 177, the title ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'', giving his son the same status as his own and formally sharing power.

On 23 December of the same year, the two Augusti celebrated a joint [[Roman triumph|triumph]], and Commodus was given [[tribune|tribunician]] power. On 1 January 177, Commodus became [[consul]] for the first time, which made him, aged 15, the youngest consul in Roman history up to that time. He subsequently married [[Bruttia Crispina]] before accompanying his father to the Danubian front once more in 178, where Marcus Aurelius died on 17 March 180, leaving the 18-year-old Commodus sole emperor.

==Solo reign (180–192)==
Upon his ascension, Commodus devalued the [[Roman currency]]. He reduced the weight of the [[denarius]] from 96 per [[Roman pound]] to 105 per Roman pound (3.85&amp;nbsp;grams to 3.35&amp;nbsp;grams).&lt;!-- Note, weights are per pound, so larger numbers are lower weight --&gt; He also reduced the silver purity from 79&amp;nbsp;percent to 76&amp;nbsp;percent&amp;nbsp;– the silver weight dropping from 2.57&amp;nbsp;grams to 2.34&amp;nbsp;grams. In 186 he further reduced the purity and silver weight to 74&amp;nbsp;percent and 2.22&amp;nbsp;grams respectively, being 108 to the Roman pound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm|title=Tulane University "Roman Currency of the Principate"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reduction of the denarius during his rule was the largest since the empire's first devaluation during [[Nero]]'s reign.

Whereas the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] had been marked by almost continuous warfare, that of Commodus was comparatively peaceful in the military sense but was marked by political strife and the increasingly arbitrary and capricious behaviour of the emperor himself. In the view of [[Dio Cassius]], a contemporary observer of the period, his accession marked the descent "from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust".&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html#36 72.36.4], Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his notoriety, and considering the importance of his reign, Commodus' years in power are not well chronicled. The principal surviving literary sources are [[Herodian]], Dio Cassius (a contemporary and sometimes first-hand observer, but for this reign, only transmitted in fragments and abbreviations), and the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' (untrustworthy for its character as a work of literature rather than history, with elements of fiction embedded within its biographies; in the case of Commodus, it may well be embroidering upon what the author found in reasonably good contemporary sources).

[[File:Commodus denier verso ag1.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Denarius]] featuring Commodus]]
Commodus remained with the Danube armies for only a short time before negotiating a peace treaty with the Danubian tribes. He then returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph for the conclusion of the wars on 22 October 180. Unlike the preceding Emperors [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius]] and Marcus Aurelius, he seems to have had little interest in the business of administration and tended throughout his reign to leave the practical running of the state to a succession of favourites, beginning with [[Saoterus]], a freedman from [[Nicomedia]] who had become his [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]].

Dissatisfaction with this state of affairs would lead to a series of conspiracies and attempted coups, which in turn eventually provoked Commodus to take charge of affairs, which he did in an increasingly dictatorial manner. Nevertheless, though the [[Roman Senate|senatorial order]] came to hate and fear him, the evidence suggests that he remained popular with the army and the common people for much of his reign, not least because of his lavish shows of largesse (recorded on his coinage) and because he staged and took part in spectacular [[gladiator]]ial combats.

One of the ways he paid for his donatives (imperial handouts) and mass entertainments was to tax the senatorial order, and on many inscriptions, the traditional order of the two nominal powers of the state, the Senate and People (''[[SPQR|Senatus Populusque Romanus]]'') is provocatively reversed (''Populus Senatusque...'').

===Conspiracies of 182===
[[File:Commodus, Hermitage Museum.JPG|thumb|Commodus with attributes of [[Helios]], [[Apollo]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], late 2nd century AD, [[sardonyx]] [[Cameo (carving)|cameo relief]], [[Hermitage Museum]], St. Petersburg.]]
At the outset of his reign, Commodus, aged 18, inherited many of his father's senior advisers, notably [[Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus]] (the second husband of Commodus' eldest sister [[Lucilla]]), his father-in-law [[Gaius Bruttius Praesens]], [[Titus Fundanius Vitrasius Pollio]], and [[Gaius Aufidius Victorinus|Aufidius Victorinus]], who was [[Praefectus urbi|Prefect of the City of Rome]]. He also had four surviving sisters, all of them with husbands who were potential rivals. Lucilla was over ten years his senior and held the rank of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augusta]] as the widow of her first husband, [[Lucius Verus]].

The first crisis of the reign came in 182, when Lucilla engineered a conspiracy against her brother. Her motive is alleged to have been envy of the [[Roman Empress|Empress]] [[Bruttia Crispina|Crispina]]. Her husband, Pompeianus, was not involved, but two men alleged to have been her lovers, [[Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus]] (the consul of 167, who was also her first cousin) and [[Appius Claudius Quintianus]], attempted to murder Commodus as he entered a theater. They bungled the job and were seized by the emperor's bodyguard.

Quadratus and Quintianus were executed. Lucilla was exiled to [[Capri]] and later killed. Pompeianus retired from public life. One of the two [[praetorian prefect]]s, [[Tarrutenius Paternus]], had actually been involved in the conspiracy but his involvement was not discovered until later on, and in the aftermath, he and his colleague, [[Tigidius Perennis|Sextus Tigidius Perennis]], were able to arrange for the murder of Saoterus, the hated chamberlain.

Commodus took the loss of Saoterus badly, and Perennis now seized the chance to advance himself by implicating Paternus in a second conspiracy, one apparently led by [[Publius Salvius Julianus]], who was the son of the jurist [[Salvius Julianus]] and was betrothed to Paternus' daughter. Salvius and Paternus were executed along with a number of other prominent consulars and senators. [[Didius Julianus]], the future emperor and a relative of Salvius Julianus, was dismissed from the governorship of [[Germania Inferior]].

====Cleander====
Perennis took over the reins of government and Commodus found a new chamberlain and favourite in [[Marcus Aurelius Cleander|Cleander]], a [[Phrygia]]n [[freedman]] who had married one of the emperor's mistresses, Demostratia. Cleander was in fact the person who had murdered Saoterus. After those attempts on his life, Commodus spent much of his time outside Rome, mostly on the family estates at Lanuvium. Being physically strong, his chief interest was in sport: taking part in [[horse racing]], [[chariot racing]], and combats with beasts and men, mostly in private but also on occasion in public.

===Dacia and Britain===
[[File:Commodus, Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna - 20100226.jpg|thumb|250px|A bust of Commodus ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna). According to [[Herodian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=d7DhHGX6wZkC&amp;pg=PA59|title=Septimius Severus: The African Emperor|first1=Anthony R.|last1=Birley|first2=Anthony R.|last2=Birley|date=1 June 2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203028599}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was well proportioned and attractive, with naturally [[blond]] and curly hair.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Wells (2004) [1984, 1992]. ''The Roman Empire''. Second Edition (sixth reprint edition). Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-77770-0}}, p 255.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Commodus was inaugurated in 183 as consul with Aufidius Victorinus for a colleague and assumed the title ''Pius''. War broke out in [[Dacia]]: few details are available, but it appears two future contenders for the throne, [[Clodius Albinus]] and [[Pescennius Niger]], both distinguished themselves in the campaign. Also, in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] in 184, the governor [[Ulpius Marcellus]] re-advanced the Roman frontier northward to the [[Antonine Wall]], but the [[legionaries]] revolted against his harsh discipline and acclaimed another legate, Priscus, as emperor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Dio Cassius 73.10.2, Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt;

Priscus refused to accept their acclamations, and Perennis had all the legionary [[legatus|legates]] in Britain [[Cashiering|cashiered]]. On 15 October 184 at the [[Capitoline Games]], a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosopher publicly denounced Perennis before Commodus.  His tale wasn't believed and he was immediately put to death. According to Dio Cassius, Perennis, though ruthless and ambitious, was not personally corrupt and generally administered the state well.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

However, the following year, a detachment of soldiers from Britain (they had been drafted to [[Roman Italy|Italy]] to suppress brigands) also denounced Perennis to the emperor as plotting to make his own son emperor (they had been enabled to do so by Cleander, who was seeking to dispose of his rival), and Commodus gave them permission to execute him as well as his wife and sons. The fall of Perennis brought a new spate of executions: Aufidius Victorinus committed suicide. Ulpius Marcellus was replaced as [[Governors of Roman Britain|governor of Britain]] by [[Pertinax]]; brought to Rome and tried for treason, Marcellus narrowly escaped death.

===Cleander's zenith and fall (185–190)===
[[File:1699 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - A youth, possibly Commodus - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 11 2009.jpg|thumb|Remnants of a Roman bust of a youth with a [[blond]] beard, perhaps depicting emperor Commodus, [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]
Cleander proceeded to concentrate power in his own hands and to enrich himself by becoming responsible for all public offices: he sold and bestowed entry to the Senate, army commands, [[Roman governor|governorships]] and, increasingly, even the [[suffect consul]]ships to the highest bidder. Unrest around the empire increased, with large numbers of army deserters causing trouble in [[Gaul]] and [[Germania|Germany]]. Pescennius Niger mopped up the deserters in Gaul in a military campaign, and a revolt in [[Brittany]] was put down by two [[Roman legion|legions]] brought over from Britain.

In 187, one of the leaders of the deserters, Maternus, came from Gaul intending to assassinate Commodus at the Festival of the Great Goddess in March, but he was betrayed and executed. In the same year, [[Pertinax]] unmasked a conspiracy by two enemies of Cleander&amp;nbsp;– Antistius Burrus (one of Commodus' brothers-in-law) and Arrius Antoninus. As a result, Commodus appeared even more rarely in public, preferring to live on his estates.

Early in 188, Cleander disposed of the current praetorian prefect, [[Publius Atilius Aebutianus|Atilius Aebutianus]], and himself took over supreme command of the Praetorians at the new rank of ''a pugione'' ("dagger-bearer") with two praetorian prefects subordinate to him. Now at the zenith of his power, Cleander continued to sell public offices as his private business. The climax came in the year 190, which had 25 suffect consuls&amp;nbsp;– a record in the 1,000-year history of the Roman consulship—all appointed by Cleander (they included the future Emperor [[Septimius Severus]]).

In the spring of 190, Rome was afflicted by a food shortage, for which the ''praefectus annonae'' [[Papirius Dionysius]], the official actually in charge of the [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|grain supply]], contrived to lay the blame on Cleander. At the end of June, a mob demonstrated against Cleander during a horse race in the [[Circus Maximus]]: he sent the praetorian guard to put down the disturbances, but Pertinax, who was now City Prefect of Rome, dispatched the ''[[Vigiles Urbani]]'' to oppose them. Cleander fled to Commodus, who was at [[Laurentum]] in the house of the [[Sextus Quinctilius Condianus|Quinctilii]], for protection, but the mob followed him calling for his head.

At the urging of his mistress [[Marcia (mistress of Commodus)|Marcia]], Commodus had Cleander beheaded and his son killed. Other victims at this time were the praetorian prefect Julius Julianus, Commodus' cousin [[Annia Fundania Faustina]], and his brother-in-law Mamertinus. Papirius Dionysius was executed, too.

The emperor now changed his name to Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus. At 29, he took over more of the reins of power, though he continued to rule through a cabal consisting of Marcia, his new chamberlain Eclectus, and the new praetorian prefect [[Quintus Aemilius Laetus]].

===Megalomania (190–192)===
[[File:Denarius of Commodus (YORYM 2000 4292) obverse.jpg|thumb|A Denarius of Commodus]]
In opposition to the Senate, in his pronouncements and [[iconography]], Commodus had always stressed his unique status as a source of god-like power, liberality, and physical prowess. Innumerable statues around the empire were set up portraying him in the guise of [[Hercules]], reinforcing the image of him as a demigod, a physical giant, a protector, and a battler against beasts and men (see "Commodus and Hercules" and "Commodus the Gladiator" below). Moreover, as Hercules, he could claim to be the son of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the supreme god of the Roman [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. These tendencies now increased to [[megalomania]]cal proportions. Far from celebrating his descent from Marcus Aurelius, the actual source of his power, he stressed his own personal uniqueness as the bringer of a new order, seeking to re-cast the empire in his own image.

During 191, the city of Rome was extensively damaged by a fire that raged for several days, during which many public buildings including the [[Pax (mythology)|Temple of Pax]], the [[Temple of Vesta]], and parts of the imperial palace were destroyed.

Perhaps seeing this as an opportunity, early in 192 Commodus, declaring himself the new [[Romulus]], ritually re-founded Rome, renaming the city ''Colonia Lucia Annia Commodiana''. All the months of the year were renamed to correspond exactly with his (now twelve) names: ''Lucius'', ''Aelius'', ''Aurelius'', ''Commodus'', ''Augustus'', ''Herculeus'', ''Romanus'', ''Exsuperatorius'', ''Amazonius'', ''Invictus'', ''Felix'', and ''Pius''. The legions were renamed ''Commodianae'', the fleet which imported grain from [[Africa province|Africa]] was termed ''Alexandria Commodiana Togata'', the Senate was entitled the Commodian Fortunate Senate, his palace and the Roman people themselves were all given the name ''Commodianus'', and the day on which these reforms were decreed was to be called ''Dies Commodianus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/commod.htm|title=Roman Emperors - DIR commodus|website=www.roman-emperors.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, he presented himself as the fountainhead of the Empire, Roman life, and religion. He also had the head of the [[Colossus of Nero]] adjacent to the [[Colosseum]] replaced with his own portrait, gave it a club, and placed a [[bronze]] [[lion]] at its feet to make it look like ''Hercules Romanus'', and added an inscription boasting of being "the only left-handed fighter to conquer twelve times one thousand men".&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 73.22.3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination (192)===
[[File:Römermuseum Osterburken (DerHexer) 2012-09-30 008.jpg|thumb|[[Damnatio memoriae]] of Commodus on an inscription in the Museum of Roman History [[Osterburken]]. The abbreviation "CO" has been restored with paint.]]
In November 192, Commodus held Plebeian Games, in which he shot hundreds of animals with arrows and javelins every morning, and fought as a gladiator every afternoon, winning all the fights. Also, in December, he announced his intention to inaugurate the year 193 as both consul and gladiator on 1 January.

At this point, the prefect Laetus formed a conspiracy with Eclectus to supplant Commodus with Pertinax, taking Marcia into their confidence. On 31 December, Marcia poisoned Commodus' food but he vomited up the poison, so the conspirators sent his wrestling partner [[Narcissus (wrestler)|Narcissus]] to strangle him in his bath. Upon his death, the Senate declared him a public enemy (a ''de facto'' ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'') and restored the original name of the city of Rome and its institutions. Statues of Commodus were demolished. His body was buried in the [[Mausoleum of Hadrian]].

Commodus' death marked the end of the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty]].
Commodus was succeeded by [[Pertinax]], whose reign was short lived, being the first to fall victim to the [[Year of the Five Emperors]].

In 195, the emperor [[Septimius Severus]], trying to gain favour with the family of Marcus Aurelius, rehabilitated Commodus' memory and had the Senate deify him.&lt;ref&gt;To “accept kinship with Commodus&amp;nbsp;... the bluntly pragmatic decision was taken to deify the former emperor, thus legitimizing Severus’ seizure of power.”  See [[Annelise Freisenbruch]], ''Caesars' Wives: Sex, Power, and Politics in the Roman Empire'' (London and New York: Free Press, 2010), 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Commodo, 180-192 dc, collez. albani.JPG|thumb|Bust of Commodus from the [[Capitoline Museum]]]]
Cassius Dio, a first-hand witness, describes him as "not naturally wicked but, on the contrary, as guileless as any man that ever lived. His great simplicity, however, together with his cowardice, made him the slave of his companions, and it was through them that he at first, out of ignorance, missed the better life and then was led on into lustful and cruel habits, which soon became second nature."&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 73.1.2, Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt;

His recorded actions do tend to show a rejection of his father's policies, his father's advisers, and especially his father's austere lifestyle, and an alienation from the surviving members of his family. It seems likely that he was brought up in an atmosphere of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[asceticism]], which he rejected entirely upon his accession to sole rule.

After repeated attempts on Commodus' life, [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizens]] were often killed for making him angry. One such notable event was the attempted extermination of the house of the Quinctilii. Condianus and Maximus were executed on the pretext that, while they were not implicated in any plots, their wealth and talent would make them unhappy with the current state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 73.5.3, Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes of name===
[[File:CommodoDaAlbano-MNRPalMassimo.JPG|thumb|Bust of Commodus from the [[Palazzo Massimo alle Terme]]]]
On his accession as sole ruler, Commodus added the name Antoninus to his official nomenclature, presumably to honor his grandfather, [[Antoninus Pius]]. In October 180 he changed his ''[[praenomen]]'' from Lucius to Marcus, presumably in honour of his father.  He later took the title of ''Felix'' in 185. In 191 he restored his ''praenomen'' to Lucius and added the family name Aelius, apparently linking himself to [[Hadrian]] and Hadrian's adopted son [[Lucius Aelius Caesar]], whose original name was also Commodus.

Later that year he dropped Antoninus and adopted as his full style Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus Augustus Herculeus Romanus Exsuperatorius Amazonius Invictus Felix Pius (the order of some of these titles varies in the sources). "Exsuperatorius" (the supreme) was a title given to Jupiter, and "Amazonius" identified him again with Hercules.

An inscribed altar from [[Dura-Europos]] on the Euphrates shows that Commodus' titles and the renaming of the months were disseminated to the furthest reaches of the Empire; moreover, that even auxiliary military units received the title Commodiana, and that Commodus claimed two additional titles: ''Pacator Orbis'' (pacifier of the world) and ''Dominus Noster'' (Our Lord). The latter eventually would be used as a conventional title by Roman emperors, starting about a century later, but Commodus seems to have been the first to assume it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spiedel |first=M. P |year=1993 |title=Commodus the God-Emperor and the Army |journal=Journal of Roman Studies |volume=83 |issue= |pages=109–114 |id= |quote= |doi=10.2307/300981|jstor=300981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commodus and Hercules===
Disdaining the more philosophic inclinations of his father, Commodus was extremely proud of his physical prowess. The historian Herodian, a contemporary, described Commodus as an extremely handsome man.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Michael. The Roman Emperors (1985)pp 99.&lt;/ref&gt;  As mentioned above, he ordered many statues to be made showing him dressed as Hercules with a lion's hide and a club. He thought of himself as the reincarnation of Hercules, frequently emulating the legendary hero's feats by appearing in the arena to fight a variety of wild animals. He was left-handed and very proud of the fact.&lt;ref&gt;Dio, Cassius. Roman History: Epitome of Book LXXIII pp 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius Dio and the writers of the ''[[Augustan History]]'' say that Commodus was a skilled archer, who could shoot the heads off [[ostriches]] in full gallop, and kill a [[Black panther|panther]] as it attacked a victim in the arena.

===Commodus the gladiator===
Commodus also had a passion for gladiatorial combat, which he took so far as to take to the [[arena]] himself, dressed as a [[secutor]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward. The history of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. Vol. 5. Methuen, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans found Commodus' gladiatorial combats to be scandalous and disgraceful.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian's Roman History F.L. Muller Edition 1.15.7&lt;/ref&gt;  It was rumoured that he was actually the son, not of Marcus Aurelius, but of a gladiator whom his mother Faustina had taken as a lover at the coastal resort of [[Caieta]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'', Life of Marcus Aurelius, XIX. The film ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'' makes use of this story: one of the characters is an old gladiator who eventually reveals himself to be Commodus' real father.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the arena, Commodus always won, since his opponents always submitted to the emperor. Thus, these public fights would not end in death, although wounded soldiers and amputees would be placed in the arena for Commodus to slay with a sword.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Citizens of Rome missing their feet through accident or illness were taken to the arena, where they were tethered together for Commodus to club to death while pretending they were giants.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 73.20.3, Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt; Privately, it was his custom to slay his practice opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 73.10.3&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=What does this mean? Who were the practice opponents? How did he slay them?|date=January 2018}} For each appearance in the arena, he charged the city of Rome a million [[sestertius|sesterces]], straining the Roman economy.

Commodus was also known for fighting exotic animals in the arena, often to the horror of the Roman people. According to Gibbon, Commodus once killed 100 lions in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon pg 106 "disgorged at once a hundred lions; a hundred darts"&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he decapitated a running [[ostrich]] with a specially designed dart&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: Volume I'' Everyman's Library (Knopf) New York. 1910. pg 106 "with arrows whose point was shaped in the form of a crescent"&lt;/ref&gt; and afterwards carried his sword and the bleeding head of the dead bird over to the section where the Senators sat and motioned as though they were next.&lt;ref name=foxcomm&gt;Lane Fox, Robin ''The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian'' Basic Books.  2006 pg 446 "brandishing a sword in one hand and bloodied neck...He gesticulated at the Senate."&lt;/ref&gt;  Dio notes that the targeted senators actually found this more ridiculous than frightening, and chewed on [[Laurus nobilis|laurel]] leaves to conceal their laughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/73*.html Roman History by Cassius Dio] penelope.uchicago.edu&lt;/ref&gt;  On another occasion, Commodus killed three [[elephant]]s on the floor of the arena by himself.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, H. H ''The Elephant in the Greek and Roman World'' Thames and Hudson. 1974 pg 252&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Commodus killed a [[giraffe]], which was considered to be a strange and helpless beast.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon pg 107 "*1 Commodus killed a camelopardalis or giraffe&amp;nbsp;... the most useless of the quadrupeds".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media portrayals==
* In 1964's ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', a fictionalized Commodus who serves as the main antagonist of the film is portrayed by [[Christopher Plummer]].
* In 2000's [[Academy Award]]-winner for Best Picture, ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', a fictionalized Commodus serves as the main antagonist of the film. He is played by [[Joaquin Phoenix]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002128/ IMDb] Commodus (Character) from Gladiator (2000) Retrieved October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* A character in the 2013 video game ''[[Ryse: Son of Rome]]'' is named Commodus and is one of the main antagonists of the game. The son of Emperor [[Nero]], he shares several traits with the historic Commodus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/community/2014/02/08/history-behind-the-game-ryse-son-of-rome/ |title=History Behind The Game – Ryse: Son of Rome |last=Nichols |first=Derek |date=8 February 2014 |access-date=11 August 2018 |website=[[Venture Beat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Rick Riordan]]'s book series ''[[The Trials of Apollo]]'', Commodus appears as one of the main antagonists, being part of the evil Triumvirate of deified Roman emperors.
* Commodus is a minor antagonist in the 2005 video game ''[[Colosseum: Road to Freedom]]''. The player can fight Commodus in the game, who dresses as the god Hercules. The game takes liberties with the events surrounding his death, with the player being the one who actually kills him rather than the wrestler Narcissus.
* The 2017 mini-series ''[[Roman Empire: Reign of Blood]]'' retells his story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/blog/box-set-binge-432091/ |title=Box Set Binge: Roman Empire: Reign of Blood, The Path and Deutschland 83 |last=Agius |first=Den |date=19 November 2016 |access-date=20 July 2018 |website=[[What's on TV]] |publisher=[[TI Media Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://decider.com/2016/11/15/roman-empire-reign-of-blood-lucilla-tai-berdinner-blades/ |title='Roman Empire: Reign Of Blood': Who Was The Real Lucilla? |last=O'Keefe |first=Meghan |date=25 November 2016 |access-date=20 July 2018 |website=[[Decider (website)|Decider]] |publisher=[[NYP Holdings, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7761">'''David of Dinant''' ({{circa}} 1160 – c. 1217) was a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] philosopher.  He may have been a member of, or at least been influenced by, a pantheistic sect known as the [[Amalricians]].  David was condemned by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] in 1210 for his writing of the "[[Quaternuli]]" (Little Notebooks), which forced him to flee [[Paris]].  When and where he died is unknown; all that can be ascertained is that he died after the year 1215, as he was condemned again in the council of 1215.

Since David's works were banned, most of what is known of him is from the writings of his contemporaries and opponents, chiefly [[Albert the Great]] and [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]].  David's philosophy was that everything could be divided among bodies, minds, and eternal substances. The indivisible substrate or constituent of bodies is matter (''yle''); of minds or souls, intellect (''nous''); and of eternal substances, God (''Deus''). These three, matter, intellect, and God, are actually one and the same. Consequently, all things, material, intellectual, and spiritual, have one and the same essence — [[God]].

==Life and work==
Little is known about the details of his life. It is not certain whether he was born at [[Dinant]] in [[Belgium]], or at [[Dinan]] in [[Brittany]]. He is believed to have lived for some time at the [[Holy See|Roman Court]] under [[Pope Innocent III]]. He was a ''magister'', or teacher, most likely at the [[University of Paris]], and he studied the classical works of [[Aristotle]] which had been reintroduced to Europe after the Crusades. It seems likely he was especially influenced by Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''.&lt;ref name="copleston" /&gt;  It was in Paris that his work, entitled ''Quaternuli'' (Little Notebooks), was condemned by a provincial council in 1210.  The Council was headed by [[Peter of Corbeil]], the Bishop of Sens, and ordered the body of [[Amalric of Chartres]] to be disinterred and burned, David's writings to be burned, and forbade reading Aristotle's works on natural philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Bosmajian, Haig A. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=UkAXPuObVBUC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=David+of+Dinant+-Wikipedia+-%22Catholic+Encyclopedia%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BOuxU8ghGo&amp;sig=y1-IX0Ubr_86IrVbYUtQ3ynldIU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=50nCSe5qirDMBcnSjKAL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result Burning Books]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Anyone in the possession of David's writings after Christmas was declared a heretic.  This condemnation of both David and Aristotle was repeated in 1215 by a letter of Cardinal [[Robert of Courçon|Robert Courçon]], papal legate.  From a work ascribed to Albert the Great, "''[[Compilatio de Novo Spiritu]]''", in the Munich Library,&lt;ref&gt;(MS. lat. 311, fol. 92 b)&lt;/ref&gt; we learn further that in consequence of the condemnation, David fled from France, and so escaped punishment.  Besides the "Quaternuli", another work entitled "De Tomis, seu Divisionibus" is mentioned.  It is not improbable, however, that this was merely another title for the "Quaternuli". The effect of the order issued by the council was to cause all the writing of David to disappear. Thus, his doctrines are derived from the assertions of his contemporaries and opponents, notably Albert the Great and St. Thomas as mentioned above.

==Theology==
From these sources we learn that David was a Pantheist. He identified God with the material substratum of all things, ''[[materia prima]]'' (prime matter).&lt;ref&gt;(St. Thomas, Summa Theol., I, Q. iii, a. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; He reduced all reality to three categories, namely bodies, minds, and eternal substances. The indivisible substrate or constituent of bodies is matter (''yle''); of minds, or souls, intellect (''nous''); and of eternal substances, God (Deus). These three, [[matter]], [[intellect]], and God, are one and the same. Consequently, all things, material, intellectual, and spiritual, have one and the same essence — God.&lt;ref&gt;(St. Thomas, In II Sent., dist. xvii, Q. i; Albert the Great, Sum. Theol., II, Tract. xii, Q. lxxii, a. 2)&lt;/ref&gt;  The phraseology, which must be David's own, as well as the title above mentioned, "De Tomis", suggests the influence of [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]]. Eriugena's work must have been widely known and read in the first decades of the thirteenth century, as is evident from many undeniable facts. Whether David was influenced also by [[Amalric of Chartres]] is a matter of debate. Albert, who was a contemporary of David, says that David merely renewed the heresy of someone known as Alexander, "who taught that God and intellect and matter are one substance". It is impossible to determine whom Albert means by Alexander, "a disciple of Xenophanes"; probably the reference is to some Arabian work that went under the name of a Greek philosopher. There were several works of that kind current in the early part of the thirteenth century. Some critics, however, put forward the surmise that David's immediate source was [[Avicebron]]'s "[[Fons Vitae|Fons Vitæ]]", or the work "De Unitate", written by Archdeacon [[Gundisalvi of Segovia]], who was well versed in Arabian philosophical literature. Whatever the source, the doctrines were pantheistic, as all authorities concur in describing them.

The [[1913 Catholic Encyclopedia]] takes a rather dim view of David's philosophy, and considers the harsh response understandable.  It says:

:((This pantheism)) of itself would justify the drastic measures to which the Council of Paris had recourse. There were, moreover, circumstances which rendered summary condemnation necessary. On the one hand the [[University of Paris]] was being made the scene of an organized attempt to foist the Arabian pantheistic interpretation of Greek philosophy on the schools of Latin Christendom. Texts, translations, and commentaries were introduced every day from Spain, in which doctrines incompatible with Christian dogma were openly taught. On the other hand, there was the popular movement in the South of France which found its principal expression in the [[Cathar|Albigensian heresy]], while in learned and ascetic communities in the North, the anti-hierarchical mysticism of the Calabrian [[Joachim of Floris]] was being combined with the more speculative pantheistic mysticism of [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]].  In view of these conditions the condemnation of the errors of David of Dinant, the complete extirpation of the sect of [[Amalricians]] to which he apparently belonged, and the unwonted harshness of St. Thomas's reference to him cannot be judged untimely or intemperate.

Historians have thought that the reason St. Albert and St. Thomas responded to David at all was not so much out of fear of David's pantheism, but rather to defend Aristotle.  David strongly drew on Aristotle's thoughts on prime matter and form, and Albert and Thomas – both of whom respected Aristotle – wanted to show that Aristotle's writings need not imply pantheism.  To do this, they had to dispute David, lest the banning of Aristotle's writings spread outside Paris.&lt;ref name="copleston"&gt;Copleston, Frederick Charles. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KmhCGt9hKC8C&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=David+of+Dinant+-Wikipedia+-%22Catholic+Encyclopedia%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wKY_8P9PHD&amp;sig=k0v5AV_dszcXewjkkZ4bmKkR0tc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=50nCSe5qirDMBcnSjKAL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result#PPA185,M1 A history of philosophy]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Demophon''' was a [[Clairvoyance|seer]] in [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s entourage. The King ignored Demophon's prediction of danger before the attack on the Mallian town in India in 325 BC. Demophon was one of several men who slept in the alleged temple of Serapis at the time of Alexander's fatal illness.

The '''Dhawahir''' (singular Dhahiri) is a tribe of the [[United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates (UAE).]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf Vol II|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribe's main centre was the [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Buraimi Oasis]] and the village, then town (now city) of [[Al Ain]]. They have long had a strong alliance with the Ruling family of [[Abu Dhabi]], the [[Bani Yas]].

== Buraimi and early history ==
The tribe's traditional area of influence is the Buraimi Oasis, where at the turn of the 20th century, they owned most of the cultivated land and property with the exception of Buraimi village itself. Numbering 4,500, the tribe consists of three subsections: the [[Daramikah]], who populated [[Hili Archaeological Park|Hili]], Mutared and [[Qattara Oasis|Qattara]]; the Jawabir in Al Ain and the Bani Saad who lived in Jimi. Staying in the villages for the summer date season, in winter the community would move throughout the [[Trucial States]]. They kept large flocks of sheep and herded camels and traded in charcoal, which they burned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The fertile woodlands of the oasis, irrigated by a highly effective ''falaj'' system supported this wood-burning industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=38|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early history of the Dhawahir seems to suggest they originally came from the south and populated [[Ad Dhahirah Governorate|Dhahirah]] before Buraimi. A later wave of settlers, the [[Na'im]], have long had an uneasy relationship with the Dhawahir and the two tribes were frequently in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=48|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflict with Muscat and Sharjah ==
A number of interests jostled for influence over the Dhawahir and Na'im of Buraimi, including the [[List of rulers of Oman|Sultan of Muscat]], the [[Emirate of Nejd|Wahhabis]] (who had made a number of incursions) and [[Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi|Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr]] of Sharjah, who had established a number of forts in the oasis. [[Tahnun bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan|Sheikh Tahnun bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan]] commanded the loyalty of many of the [[Bedouin]] families in the area ('You will be aware that [[Ad Dhahirah Governorate|Dhahirah]] belongs to us' he told the British in 1839) and established his primacy there when, in 1824, an agreement was forced on Sharjah in which Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi recognised Tahnun's claim to Buraimi and then demolished the forts he had built there.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945874284|title=The Origins of the United Arab Emirates : a Political and Social History of the Trucial States.|last=Said.|first=Zahlan, Rosemarie|date=2016|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=|isbn=9781317244653|location=|pages=241|oclc=945874284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dhawahir and [[Manasir (tribe)|Manasir]] in Buraimi were close and [[Khalifa bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan|Sheikh Khalifa bin Shakbut Al Nahyan]] acceded to an agreement in 1840, in which he took full responsibility for the Bani Yas, Manasir and, for the first time, the Dhawahir. Khalifa enjoyed their support as fighting men as he did most of the tribes of the interior. His popularity with the tribes was also enjoyed by his son, [[Saeed bin Tahnun Al Nahyan|Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnun Al Nahyan]], when facing incursions by the Wahhabis. Following one such incident, Saeed moved on [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Buraimi]], capturing his two forts back from the Wahhabis with the help of both the Dhawahir and Awamir. He then pulled together the [[Bani Qitab]], Ghafalah, Awamir and Bani Yas in Khatam and placed the Manasir and [[Mazari (Emirati)|Mazari]] in Dhafrah to block the relieving Wahhabi army under Sa'ad bin Mutlaq. By 1950, Saeed's great tribal association had cleared Burami Oasis of Wahhabi forces. He subsequently accepted a stipend from the Sultan of Muscat for the defence of Buraimi. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=50|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strong and longstanding alliance between the Bani Yas and the Dhawahir was relatively unusual, with most of the tribes of the interior keen to assert their independence. The Na'im, for instance, enjoyed an often truculent relationship with the Sultan of Muscat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=57|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uprising against Zayed ==
It wasn't always smooth sailing, however. [[Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan|Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifah Al Nahyan]], known as 'Zayed the Great', was a strong and charismatic leader and increased his hold on Buraimi by buying date groves and water rights, predominantly from the Dhawahir. It soon became obvious that this policy was changing the pattern of ownership throughout the oasis and the Dhawahir rebelled. Determined to press ahead with his scheme, he reconciled with the Na'im and then went to war with the Dhawahir in 1877. After a month-long conflict, Zayed prevailed and took two Dhawahir Sheikhs hostage to guarantee the good behaviour of the tribe. In 1891 he once again marched on the oasis, with the support of Dubai, and a force of 30 horsemen and 300 camel riders quelled the opposition and took the Dhawahir's main settlement 'Ain Dhawahir (now simply known as 'Al Ain'). He built a fort there to underline his dominion over the oasis and established a ''wali'', wisely appointing a member of the Dhawahir as his headman. Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hilal Al Dhahiri lived in Jimi and was a loyal and effective representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=109|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dhawahir subsequently worked for their Bani Yas owners in cultivating the groves. As subjects of Abu Dhabi, the Dhawahir paid taxes on the date crop, as well as water fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/64689681|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=1941-|first=Heard-Bey, Frauke,|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|year=|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=39|oclc=64689681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Don Conroy''' is an [[Irish people|Irish]] artist, environmentalist, television personality and writer of [[children's literature]]. His artistic and literary work focuses on natural themes, including wildlife.

He works for [[wildlife conservation]] in Ireland and made regular appearances on ''[[The Den (Ireland)|The Den]]'' since it began in 1986, becoming the longest continually serving member of the cast. He has also appeared publicly  at libraries, schools and elsewhere, where he entertains children with stories and drawings of various animals, in much the same capacity as his role on ''The Den''.

His favourite animal is the [[barn owl]].

==Biography==
Conroy studied life drawings and culture at the [[National College of Art and Design]] and then worked as designer and illustrator for advertising agencies as well as in the theatre. He played an important part in the highly successful project to reintroduce the [[golden eagle]] to Ireland, as well as establishing a sanctuary for [[whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s in Irish waters (the first of its kind in Europe). One of his favourite creatures to draw is the [[barn owl]]; it has inspired him to write a poem and he has drawn it many times over the years&amp;mdash;it was also the subject of his drawing at a [[Vicar Street]] reunion of ''The Den'' held by [[Today FM]]'s ''[[The Ray D'Arcy Show]]'' on 14 November 2008. 
His greatest literary works include the ''Wings'' trilogy: ''On Silent Wings'', ''Wild Wings'' and ''Sky Wings''. Other titles include ''Vampire Journal'', ''Vampire of St. Michan's'' and ''The Celestial Child''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donconroy.com/books/ages-8-12/ |title=Ages 8-12 |publisher=Don Conroy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409170404/http://donconroy.com/books/ages-8-12/ |archivedate=9 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For younger readers his titles include ''What the Owl Saw'', ''The Fox's Tale'', ''Joey's Big Day'', ''The Bookworm Who Turned Over a New Leaf'', ''Seal of Approval'', and ''Elephant at the Door''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donconroy.com/books/ages-4-7/ |title=Ages 4-7 |publisher=Don Conroy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409170451/http://donconroy.com/books/ages-4-7/ |archivedate=9 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donconroy.com/books/readers-aged-6-9/ |title=Ages 6-9 |publisher=Don Conroy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409170538/http://donconroy.com/books/readers-aged-6-9/ |archivedate=9 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives him great satisfaction to draw Barn Owls and to write about them too.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6076">'''Edgard Monge''' (born 1965) is a native of [[Nicaragua]] who is serving a ten-year sentence in [[Kingston Penitentiary]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], for four counts of aggravated [[assault]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/ca/sta/c-46/sec268.html Canada Legal Information Institute "Canlii"]&lt;/ref&gt; after he knowingly had unprotected sex while [[HIV]] infected and failed to inform his four sexual partners.  Two of his partners also became infected with HIV.  One of the two had a child from the union with Monge and the child also contracted HIV. (He was also convicted of one count of unlawfully causing bodily harm to the baby by having unprotected sex with her mother.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/ca/sta/c-46/sec269.html Canlii]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual relationships==
Monge contracted HIV from his late wife, who died of [[AIDS]] complications in November 1999.  She contracted the virus from a blood transfusion in Nicaragua in 1981.  He learned he was HIV positive in November 1999, shortly before his wife died.

Monge commenced his first sexual relationship in January 2000, even though a doctor warned him of the risks and told him to reveal his HIV status to potential partners and to use a [[condom]].

Monge explained that he did not inform his sexual partners because he did not have time and because several of the women were too immature to handle the problem.  The sentencing judge called the explanations "pathetic".

According to the evidence presented in court, Monge had the following overlapping unprotected sexual relationships with women:
* Victim #1:  January 1, 2000 - June 30, 2000.  She tested negative for HIV.
* Victim #2:  June 1, 2000 - May 30, 2001.  She is now HIV positive.  She became pregnant and her baby contracted HIV.
* Victim #3:  January 1, 2001 - June 30, 2001.  Victim #3 was a teenager.  She tested negative for HIV, but developed a [[sexually transmitted disease]].
* Victim #4:  February 1, 2001 - April 30, 2001.  Met Monge at church.  Tested HIV positive in September 2001.

In the case of Victim #2, who became pregnant from Monge, he did not tell her he was HIV positive during their relationship and did not tell her after learning she was pregnant.  This prevented the mother from taking medication that might have reduced the risk of transmission of the virus to her baby girl during pregnancy.  She also practised [[breastfeeding]], perhaps unknowingly passing the virus to the baby girl that way.

According to the evidence presented in court, when one victim broke up with him Monge told her "I gave you a present that no other guy can give you. I gave you AIDS".

Monge knew he was HIV positive and took precautions to protect his four children, for example wearing [[latex gloves]] when he cooked and letting another sibling shower his youngest daughter.

Soon to be released from prison (Frontenac Institution), Monge has met a woman at a church he goes to on Sunday. They plan to be married once Monge is released and to reside in Nicaragua. The [[Correctional Service of Canada]] has denied his request for marriage.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Sentence==
On June 27, 2002, Justice Steve Glithero of the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]] sentenced Monge to ten years in prison.

The judge said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"This is a man who carried on four sexual affairs of significant length involving frequent sex.... He knowingly and repeatedly risked the very lives of four women and a child by his callous actions which persisted over months. He's largely responsible for the ruination of three lives. The effect of his actions is tragic and immense.... His actions show a callous and cruel disregard for his own flesh and blood.... One must ask why he would date women as prospective wives and mothers, yet knowingly expose them to the risk of infection with the same condition that had resulted in the death of his wife. ... None of these were one-night stands."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Eduard Wirths''' (4 September 1909 – 20 September 1945) was the Chief [[SS]] doctor (SS-Standortarzt) at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] from September 1942 to January 1945. Thus, Wirths had formal responsibility for everything undertaken by the nearly 20 SS doctors (including [[Josef Mengele]], [[Horst Schumann]] and [[Carl Clauberg]]) who worked in the medical sections of Auschwitz between 1942–1945.

== Early life ==
Eduard Wirths was born in [[Geroldshausen]] near [[Würzburg]], [[Bavaria]] into a [[Catholic]] family with democratic [[Socialist]] leanings. His father served as a medical corpsman in the [[First World War]] and according to Dr. [[Robert Jay Lifton]] had emerged from the war "...in a depressed state with pacifist leanings, which were undoubtedly expressed in his (as one son put it) 'making doctors of us all...'" &lt;ref&gt;Lifton: p.&amp;nbsp;385&lt;/ref&gt; Wirth's younger brother, Helmut, became a notable gynecologist (who later went to Auschwitz to visit his brother to participate in cancer experiments but claimed he left after only a few days on his brother Eduard's advice, due to a disagreement and because of his revulsion of the place&lt;ref&gt;Lifton: p.&amp;nbsp;400&lt;/ref&gt;). According to Lifton "...Among the boys it was Eduard who came most under the father’s influence in becoming meticulous, obedient, and unusually conscientious and reliable&amp;nbsp;— traits that continued into his adult life. He never smoked or drank and was described as compassionate and "soft" in his responses to others..." &lt;ref&gt;Lifton, p.&amp;nbsp;385&lt;/ref&gt; The Wirths family was not known to be anti-semitic or sympathetic to radical nationalist politics.

== Nazi party membership ==
Eduard Wirths, however, became an ardent [[Nazism|Nazi]] while studying medicine at the [[University of Würzburg]] (1930–35). He joined the [[Nazi Party]] and the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] in June 1933 and applied for admission into the SS in 1934. He entered the [[Waffen SS]] in 1939, saw action in Norway and the Russian Front and was classified as medically unfit for combat duty in the spring of 1942 after a heart-attack. Wirths then chose to undertake special training for Department leaders in Dachau Concentration Camp and served as chief SS psychiatrist in [[Neuengamme concentration camp]] during July 1942. Coincidentally, in 1942 [[Josef Mengele]] was also wounded at the Russian Front, pronounced medically unfit for combat, promoted to the rank of SS-Hauptsturmführer before being assigned to Auschwitz.

== Auschwitz (1942-45) ==
Dr. Wirths was promoted to SS-[[Hauptsturmführer]] (captain) and appointed as chief camp physician&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Baumslag, ''Murderous Medicine: Nazi Doctors, Human Experimentation, And Typhus'', p.73, Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; at Auschwitz in September, 1942. He was appointed on the basis of his reputation as a competent doctor and committed Nazi who would be capable of stopping the [[typhus]] epidemics that had  increasingly affected SS personnel at Auschwitz.

At Auschwitz, Wirths was known to be protective of prisoner doctors and other prisoners doing medical work, to have improved conditions on the medical blocks and was remembered favourably by most prisoner doctors and other inmates who had contact with him. At the same time, Wirths in recommending Dr. Josef Mengele for promotion in August 1944, was able to speak of Mengele's "open, honest, firm … [and] absolutely dependable" character and "magnificent" intellectual and physical talents; of the "discretion, perseverance, and energy with which he has fulfilled every task … and … shown himself equal to every situation"; of his "valuable contribution to anthropological science by making use of the scientific materials available to him"; of his "absolute ideological firmness" and "faultless conduct [as] an SS officer" ; and personal qualities as "free, unrestrained, persuasive, and lively" discourse that rendered him "especially dear to his comrades".&lt;ref&gt;from "Beurteilung des SS Hauptsturmführers (R) Dr. Josef Mengele," 19 August 1949 (Berlin Document Center: Mengele&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Höss]], the commandant of Auschwitz between 1940 and December 1943 is said to have held Wirths in particularly high regard. He is said to have remarked of Wirths that "During my 10 years of service in concentration-camp affairs, I have never encountered a better one." &lt;ref&gt;Lifton: p.&amp;nbsp;386&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943 Wirths' benevolent and kind concern for the well-being of Auschwitz inmates resulted in him receiving a Christmas card from Langbein, a political prisoner who worked with him, which contained the message “In the past year you have saved here the lives of 93,000 people. We do not have the right to tell you our wishes. But we wish for ourselves that you stay here in the coming year.” It was signed: “One speaking for the prisoners of Auschwitz.” The figure of 93,000 was the difference in mortality rate among prisoners from typhus in the year prior to Wirths' arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Lifton: p.&amp;nbsp;389&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prisoner experimentation ===
Wirths was involved in ordering medical experimentation, particularly in gynecological and typhus-related experimental tests. Wirths's primary research concerned pre-cancerous growths of the [[cervix]]. Dr. Wirths was also interested in the sterilization of women, by removing their ovaries through surgery or radiation. It is generally acknowledged that he himself never directly participated in such experiments but delegated their conduct to subordinates. The victims of these experiments were Jewish women who had been imprisoned in [[Block 10]] of the main camp in Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Joachim Lang: ''Die Frauen von Block 10. Medizinische Experimente in Auschwitz.'' Hamburg 2011, pp. 144–167.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. E.W.J. Pearce, an Associate Professor of [[Obstetrics]] and Gynecology at the [[Truman Medical Center]] has made the following observation regarding Wirths' medical experiments: ". . . Wirths, without consent, photographed the cervices of women prisoners, then amputated the pictured cervices, and sent both photographs and specimens for study to Dr. Hinselmann of Berlin. Hinselmann was the physician who developed [[colposcopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rB0yxE2WhWIC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=colposcopy+Wirths+hinselmann&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7cYPAlzM37&amp;sig=HobpEVFkFIJqevsxRpGDTXwdpiU&amp;hl=es-419&amp;ei=AElJTdf1CoH98AaNwsirDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=colposcopy+Wirths+hinselmann&amp;f=false|title=Colposcopy of the Cervix, Vagina, and Vulva: A Comprehensive Textbook|first=Michael S.|last=Baggish|date=15 September 2018|publisher=Mosby|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selection of prisoners ===
Importantly, Wirths also asserted medical control of prisoner selections at the Auschwitz-[[Auschwitz-Birkenau|Birkenau]] camp, which, prior to spring 1943, had been conducted by the camp commander and his subordinates.  Wirths insisted upon taking his own personal turn in performing selections, which he could have deferred to physician subordinates.  Witness testimony given at the Trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]] provided a useful insight into how the SS approached the issue of how to record the deaths of Auschwitz prisoners (this did not include those who had been immediately selected for gassing- their admission was simply not recorded in the death registers).  Those who died while imprisoned at Auschwitz were always recorded as having died from natural causes and never from being executed or murdered.&lt;ref&gt;''The Trial of Adolf Eichmann'', Session 70 (Part 2 of 6)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/Sessions/Session-070-02.html Eichmann trial - The District Court Sessions&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.nizkor.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Wirths was promoted to SS-[[Sturmbannführer]] (major) in September 1944. Following the evacuation of Auschwitz in January 1945 he was transferred, along with many other former Auschwitz personnel, to the [[Mittelbau-Dora]] concentration camp in [[Thuringia]]. Wirths would again hold the post of chief camp physician until Mittelbau-Dora's evacuation in April 1945.

== Capture and suicide ==
Wirths was captured by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] at the end of the war and held in custody by British forces. Later, on 20 September 1945, knowing that he would surely face trial for numerous [[war crime]]s, Wirths committed suicide by [[hanging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.auschwitz.org.pl/m/index.php?option=com_ponygallery&amp;Itemid=3&amp;func=detail&amp;id=1457 |title=Memorial and Museum: Auschwitz-Birkenau |accessdate=16 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226001235/http://en.auschwitz.org.pl/m/index.php?option=com_ponygallery&amp;func=detail&amp;id=1457&amp;Itemid=3 |archivedate=26 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary of criminal career ==
Robert Jay Lifton has noted that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . Wirths was significantly immersed in Nazi ideology in three crucial spheres: the claim of revitalizing the German race and Volk; the biomedical path to that revitalization via purification of genes and race; and the focus on the Jews as a threat to this renewal, to the immediate and long-term "health" of the Germanic race. While Wirths did not absolutize these convictions in the manner of Mengele&amp;nbsp;— they were in him combined with a strong current of medical humanism&amp;nbsp;— his commitment to the Nazi cause was probably no less strong . . . &lt;ref&gt;Lifton, p.&amp;nbsp;412&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps illustrative of Wirths' commitment to medical 'leadership' was his tendency while at Auschwitz to drive about in a car flying a [[Red Cross]] flag as well as his enthusiasm for acting as a marriage counselor and personal adviser to other SS personnel. According to Helgard Kramer, Wirths
&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . first seized on a career as a military doctor and officer in the German elite troops of the SS, because he desperately wanted to become a member of the upper class; eventually to provide his future wife with a "decent marriage." To reach that goal he had to become a 'tough man'. . . {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Edward Bartholomew Bancroft''' ({{OldStyleDateDY|January 20,|1745|January 9, 1744}}{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|p=1}} – September 7, 1821) was a Massachusetts born physician and chemist who became a [[Double agent|double-agent]], spying for both the United States and Great Britain while serving as secretary to the American Commission in Paris during the [[American Revolution]].

==Early life==
Bancroft was born on January 20, 1745 in [[Westfield, Massachusetts|Westfield]], [[Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|p=1}} His father died of an epileptic seizure when Bancroft was two years old, and his mother remarried five years later to David Bull of [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="CI"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There Bancroft studied under [[Silas Deane]], a schoolmaster who later became an important politician and diplomat, with whom he would work in Paris. At the age of sixteen, Bancroft was apprenticed to a physician in [[Killingworth, Connecticut]], but after a few years ran away. (Bancroft returned and repaid his debt to his former master in 1766.){{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=1–5}}

==South America and London==
On July 14, 1763, after fleeing his apprenticeship, Bancroft left New England for the sugar-producing slave colonies of Dutch Guiana, where he became a plantation doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Most Amazing Scene of Wonders: Electricity and Enlightenment in Early America|last = Delbourgo|first = James|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Finger |first=Stanley |year=2009 |title=Edward Bancroft's "Torporific Eels" |journal=[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]] |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=61–79 |pmid=19168945 |doi=10.1353/pbm.0.0072}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CI"/&gt; He soon expanded his practice to multiple plantations and wrote a study of the local environment. Based on observations of experiments already being performed on live eels by Dutch colonists in and around Surinam and Essequibo, Bancroft concluded that [[electric eels|American eels]] and [[torpedo fish]] discharged electricity to stun their prey, rather than by imperceptibly swift mechanical action, as had previously been argued.{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=7–8}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4U4DAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT52&amp;lpg=PT52&amp;dq=Edward+Bancroft+electric+eel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yAYYZv8fNS&amp;sig=QqIp33IFVJuUMyCeD6QxRQP6Xzo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0va_csPHMAhXDNSYKHXbWDD8Q6AEINTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Edward%20Bancroft%20electric%20eel&amp;f=false|title=Spark from the Deep: How Shocking Experiments with Strongly Electric Fish Powered Scientific Discovery|last=Turkel|first=William J.|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Baltimore|pages=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he left South America in 1766, he published ''An Essay on the Natural History of Guiana, in South America'' in London 1769, where with the encouragement of [[Benjamin Franklin]], he embarked on a career as a man of letters.&lt;ref&gt;E. Bancroft (1769) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044107245458;view=1up;seq=11 An Essay on the Natural History of Guiana, in South America], link from [[HathiTrust]]&lt;/ref&gt; Bancroft later wrote extensively about the chemistry of dyes, based in part on his work in Dutch Guiana, contrasting non-European dyeing techniques unfavorably with the learned "philosophical chemistry" of natural philosophers like himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "Fugitive Colours: Shamans' Knowledge, Chemical Empire and Atlantic Revolutions," in Simon Schaffer, et al., eds., The Brokered World: Go-Betweens and Global Intelligence, 1770-1820|last = Delbourgo|first = James|publisher = Science History Publications|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Sagamore Beach, MA|pages = 271–320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London, Bancroft's ''Natural History of Guiana'' (1769) attracted the attention of [[Paul Wentworth (spy)|Paul Wentworth]], [[New Hampshire]]'s colonial agent in London, who hired Bancroft to survey Wentworth's plantation in [[Surinam]] and make recommendations for more efficient operation. Bancroft spent two months there before returning to London. While in Surinam, Bancroft wrote a three-volume, semi-autobiographical novel, ''The History of Charles Wentworth, Esq''. The [[epistolary novel|epistolary]] novel, which follows the life of a plantation owner (with the same surname as his friend and employer), imitates [[Voltaire|Voltaire's]] ''[[Candide]]'' and reflects Bancroft's deistic beliefs, ridiculing passages in the Bible and criticizing Christianity for its "detestable spirit of intolerance and persecution."{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=25–29}}

In 1771 Edward married the twenty-two year old Penelope Fellows, daughter of a prominent Catholic family. A son, [[Edward Nathaniel Bancroft|Edward]], was born in 1772; they eventually had six more children.{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=30–31, 239}} Bancroft was elected a [[fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1773 as "a gentleman versed in natural history and Chymistry, and author of the natural history of Guiana".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqSearch=RefNo==%27EC%2F1773%2F12%27&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl| title= Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher= Royal Society| accessdate = 2012-03-14}}{{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1773, Bancroft joined the [[Medical Society of London]], though he did not receive his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from the [[University of Aberdeen]] until 1774.{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=35–37}}

==Spying for the Americans in London==
When the [[Committee of Secret Correspondence]] sent Silas Deane (Bancroft's former teacher) to France in 1776; Franklin instructed Deane to contact Bancroft, believing he would be a source of useful information. Deane arrived in France on June 7, 1776; the next day he wrote to Bancroft in London, asking him to come to Paris. In the letter, Deane said they would discuss procuring goods for trading with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]], and he enclosed thirty [[pound sterling|pounds]] (a generous amount) for travel expenses. Deane did not mention political issues in case the letter was intercepted. Bancroft met with Deane on July 8 and learned that Deane's purpose in France was to win French aid for the Americans against Britain. While Bancroft declined the invitation to attend negotiations, he did serve as Deane's assistant and interpreter. Deane's negotiations resulted in France sending some supplies to the Americans.{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=47–48, 58–59}}

Deane told Bancroft that American leaders hoped to embroil Britain in a war against other foes (specifically, an alliance of France and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]), which they hoped would distract Britain. Though Deane and other Americans thought France would form an alliance, the ploy came to nothing. Nevertheless, it greatly troubled Bancroft. On July 26, 1776, Bancroft returned to London, assuring Deane that he would spy for the colonies.&lt;ref name="CI"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://fas.org/irp/ops/ci/docs/ci1/ch1c.htm |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |title=American Revolution to World War II |volume=1 |series=A Counterintelligence Reader |editor=Frank J. Rafalko}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London, Bancroft sent copies of recent newspapers and pamphlets on current affairs and long letters to Deane to keep the Americans informed about the thinking of the British government and people. Bancroft arranged to have his dispatches smuggled into France in French diplomatic pouches to avoid having them opened by the London post office.{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=71–73}} In December 1776 Bancroft was visited by the arsonist, [[John the Painter]], after he had set a fire near the [[Portsmouth]] dock. Bancroft refused to give him any assistance.{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=76–80}}

==Spying for the British==
Though Bancroft had worked for Franklin and Deane, he was unenthusiastic about American independence, and the possibility of a French war against Britain alarmed him. Despite his promise to Deane, he had reservations about doing anything that might promote a rift between Britain and the American colonies.&lt;ref name="CI"/&gt;

In London he met Paul Wentworth, recently recruited by the British Secret Service. Wentworth arranged for Bancroft to meet Secret Service chief [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland|William Eden]] and Lords [[Henry Howard, 12th Earl of Suffolk|Suffolk]] and [[Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath|Weymouth]], where Bancroft agreed to become a spy for Britain.  A couple of days later, on August 14, 1776, Bancroft composed a nine-page report detailing what Deane had been able to accomplish since arriving in France.{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=52–56}} In early February 1777, Bancroft visited John the Painter while he was in prison in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Incendiary: The Misadventures of John the Painter, First Modern Terrorist|last = Warner|first = Jessica|publisher = McClelland &amp; Stewart|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Toronto|pages = |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WaiY5VCtdcYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=Bancroft&amp;f=false|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after this, Franklin arrived to take over the negotiations with France. Bancroft was ordered to associate himself with Franklin. Fortuitously, Franklin appointed Bancroft as secretary to the American Commission in Paris. On March 26, 1777, Bancroft departed London for Paris, where his wife and children joined him two months later. For his spying, the British promised Bancroft a pension of 200 pounds. (This amount was later increased to 500 and then 1,000 pounds.)&lt;ref name="CI"/&gt;

Bancroft assisted Franklin and Deane by copying letters and other documents, by translating diplomatic correspondence into French or English, and by arranging for repairs, hiring crews, and buying supplies for American ships in French ports. Thus Bancroft had access to much sensitive information that he was able to pass along to the British.{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=89–94}}

Bancroft reported under the cover of weekly letters to "Mr. Richards", signed "Edward Edwards", about "gallantry" (exploits with women). But between the lines of the cover text, Bancroft wrote his reports in a special ink. Every Tuesday after 9:30 PM, he put the letter in a bottle, tied a string around it, and left it in a hole in a certain [[Buxus|box tree]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="CI"/&gt; A British official retrieved the message and replaced it with new orders. Bancroft would return later that night to recover the bottle. Through this method, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] may have seen the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|French-American Treaty of Alliance]] just two days after it was signed.&lt;ref name="CI"/&gt; Bancroft was "successful but ineffective"; that is, though he gathered a good deal of information, the British were unable to prevent a Franco-American alliance.

In December 1777, [[John Paul Jones]] arrived in France, expecting to be given command of the ship [[Indien (1778)|''Indien'']] being built in Amsterdam. Because of intelligence provided by Bancroft, the British successfully pressured the Dutch to cancel the sale of the ship.{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=176–178}} Nevertheless, with smaller vessels, Jones successfully raided coastal towns in England and Ireland and captured two British warships despite regular intelligence provided the British by Bancroft. Unaware that Bancroft was a British spy, Jones and Bancroft became close friends, and Jones even used him as an intermediary with Franklin.{{efn|In May 1778, Jones wrote to Bancroft asking for funds to feed his crew and the British prisoners they had taken; Franklin provided the money.{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=177–178}}}} In the summer of 1777, [[Arthur Lee (diplomat)|Arthur Lee]] charged that Bancroft had met with members of king's privy council; and in April 1778, a sea captain named Musco Livingston told Lee that in London he had seen a letter written by Bancroft that provided details about the French treaty before it had been signed. When Lee accused Bancroft of being a traitor, Jones came to his defense; and in early 1779, Jones convinced Livingston to retract his accusation. (Livingston's accusations had been true, but the rumor that Bancroft had met with the privy council was not.){{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=195–198}}

===Franklin's possible knowledge of Bancroft's intrigue===
On January 19, 1777, Franklin wrote to Juliana Ritchie, a woman living in a Benedictine convent in [[Cambrai]], that even if he suspected his valet to be a spy, "as he probably is, I think I should not discharge him for that, if in other Respects I lik'd him."&lt;ref name="CI"/&gt;{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=198–199}} Although some historians believe the letter indicates Franklin's suspicion of Bancroft, others have noted that after the war, Franklin remained on good terms with Bancroft while he shunned other [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]], including his own son, [[William Franklin|William]].{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|p=205}} The vast majority of historians reject the thesis that Franklin was in any way disloyal to the United States.{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|p=206}}

==Death of Silas Deane==
After the death of former American diplomat [[Silas Deane]] in 1789 aboard a ship about to sail to America, Bancroft suggested in a private conversation that Deane had committed suicide. The following year an anonymous pamphlet, ''Theodosius'', attacked the scientist and clergyman [[Joseph Priestley]] by claiming that while dying, Deane had uttered blasphemous and atheistic statements that he had supposedly derived from Priestley. Priestley, who had never met Deane, pleaded with Bancroft to set the record straight. Bancroft responded by publishing in several newspapers an account provided by the ship's captain, which stated that Deane had become suddenly ill and had been unable to say anything comprehensible during the four hours before his death.{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=220–222}}

In 1959, historian [[Julian P. Boyd|Julian Boyd]] suggested that Bancroft might have poisoned Deane, then spread rumors that Deane had committed suicide in an attempt to cover up the murder.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Boyd, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1916948?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents "Silas Deane: Death by a Kingly Teacher of Treason?"] ''William and Mary Quarterly'', 3rd ser. 16 (1959), 165-87, 310-42, 515-50.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the years since Boyd's articles appeared, his thesis has been largely dismissed as "ungrounded conjectures"; nevertheless, the theory has been widely publicized in a popular American textbook: James West Davidson and Mark Hamilton Lytle, ''After the Fact: The Art of Historical Detection'' (Boston: McGraw Hill, 1982 [sixth edition, 2010]).&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Kent Anderson and Godfrey Tryggve Anderson, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/365449 The Death of Silas Deane: Another Opinion]," ''New England Quarterly'' 57 (1984), 98-105.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=226, 294}}

==Life after the Revolutionary War==
Following the Revolutionary War, Bancroft obtained patents to import [[Quercus velutina|black oak]] into Britain and France to be turned into a yellow dye called [[quercitron]]; and he convinced John Paul Jones to invest a large sum in the business. In 1789 Jones accused Bancroft of fraud and withholding money owed him. [[Gouverneur Morris]] tried to mediate the dispute, and Bancroft did make small payments to Jones; but when Jones died in July 1792, Bancroft apparently still owed him £1,800.{{sfn|Schaeper|2011|pp=192, 247}}

In 1794, Bancroft published ''Experimental Researches Concerning the Philosophy of Permanent Colors'', a book he updated in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;E. Bancroft (1814) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044021195409;view=1up;seq=7 Experimental Researches Concerning the Philosophy of Permanent Colors, volume 1], [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044021195607;view=1up;seq=9 volume 2], links from HathiTrust&lt;/ref&gt; He was also elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1797.&lt;ref name="AAAS"&gt;{{cite web

The '''GE Three''' are three nuclear engineers who [[Whistleblower|"blew the whistle"]] on safety problems at [[nuclear power plant]]s in the United States in 1976.  The three nuclear engineers gained the attention of journalists and the [[anti-nuclear movement]]. The GE Three returned to prominence in 2011 during the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]].

==The "GE Three"==

On February 2, 1976, [[Gregory Minor|Gregory C. Minor]], Richard B. Hubbard, and Dale G. Bridenbaugh "blew the whistle" on safety problems at [[nuclear power plant]]s. The three engineers gained the attention of journalists, and their disclosures about the threats of nuclear power had a significant impact. They timed their statements to coincide with their resignations from responsible positions in [[General Electric]]'s nuclear energy division, and later established themselves as consultants on the nuclear power industry for state governments, federal agencies, and overseas governments. The consulting firm they formed, MHB Technical Associates, was technical advisor for the movie "[[The China Syndrome]]." The three engineers participated in Congressional hearings which their disclosures precipitated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,918045,00.html  The San Jose Three]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879643,00.html The Struggle over Nuclear Power]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
Following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] that devastated northern Japan, a series of explosions and a containment failure at the [[Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]] resulted in media coverage of the GE Three. Bridenbaugh described design flaws of General Electric's Mark 1 reactors, which account for five of the six reactors at the Fukushima 1 power plant. Bridenbaugh claimed that the design "did not take into account the dynamic loads that could be experienced with a loss of coolant" and that, despite efforts to retrofit the reactors, "the Mark 1 is still a little more susceptible to an accident that would result in a loss of containment."&lt;ref name=Fukushima&gt;{{cite web|last=ABC News|title=Fukushima: Mark 1 Nuclear Reactor Design Caused GE Scientist To Quit In Protest|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/fukushima-mark-nuclear-reactor-design-caused-ge-scientist/story?id=13141287|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia''' (circa 1792–1818) was one of the first [[native Hawaiian]]s to become a Christian, inspiring [[United States|American]] [[Protestant]] missionaries to come to the island during the 19th century. He is credited with starting Hawaii's conversion to Christianity. His name was usually spelled '''Obookiah''' during his lifetime. His name Henry is sometimes Hawaiianized as '''Heneri'''.

==Biography==
`Ōpūkaha`ia was born at [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka`ū]] on the [[island of Hawai`i]] in 1792. When he was 10, his family was murdered by Hawaiian warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartlett |first=Samuel Colcord |date=1872 |title=Sketches of the Missions of the American Board |location=Boston |publisher=American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions |page=38 |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924031389202 |accessdate=29 April 2015 |quote=In a civil war, his father and mother had been slain before his eyes; and when he fled with his infant brother on his back, the child was killed with a spear, he was then taken and raised by the very person who slaughtered his family.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1807, when Captain Caleb Britnall took him aboard the ''Triumph'', the teenage boy had his first English lessons en route to [[New Haven, Connecticut]], along with fellow Hawaiian [[cabin boy]] Thomas Hopu. As a student in the New Haven area, he was looked after in a succession of homes, and worked summers to help earn his keep. The future Reverend Edwin W. Dwight, a senior in [[Yale University|Yale College]] at the time, met him in 1809, when he discovered`Ōpūkaha`ia sitting on the steps of the college. When `Ōpūkaha`ia lamented that "No one give me learning," Dwight agreed to help him find tutoring.&lt;ref name=Schiff/&gt; `Ōpūkaha`ia took up residence with one of Dwight's relatives, Yale president [[Timothy Dwight IV]], a founder of the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], who instructed him in Christian and secular subjects.&lt;ref name=Schiff&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Schiff |first=Judith Ann |title=Aloha Blue |magazine=Yale Alumni Magazine |date=July 2004 |url=http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2004_07/old_yale.html |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had studied [[English grammar]] and the usual curriculum in public schools by the time he converted to Christianity in 1815, during the [[Second Great Awakening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schütz |first=Albert J. |year=1994 |title=The Voices of Eden: A History of Hawaiian Language Studies |location=Honolulu |publisher=Hawaii UP |page=95n8 |quote=The First Great Awakening [mid-18th century]…produced a conflict, often intense, between conservative Protestants—[[Old and New Light|Old Lights]]—and the revivalistic reformers – [[Old and New Light|New Lights]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and other [[Polynesians]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] requested training to spread [[the Gospel]] back home. This inspired the founding of the [[Foreign Mission School]] in 1816, administered from Boston by the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] (ABCFM). It had broad support from the residents of [[Cornwall, Connecticut]], where it moved in 1817, and from donors elsewhere in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York. During its ten years, about 100 students attended: "43 Native Americans, 13 Americans (white), and 20 Hawaiians, and other natives of the Pacific. including 2 Chinese".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Sydney K. 1939. ''Phases of the History of Cornwall''. ([[Torrington, CT]]: Cornwall Historical Society 1981). Cited in Schütz, p.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before this school opened, Edwin Dwight wrote in 1818, `Ōpūkaha`ia had begun "'reducing to system his own native tongue. As it was not a written language, but lay in its chaotic state, every thing was to be done…he had made some progress towards completing a Grammar, a Dictionary, and a Spelling-book.'"&lt;ref&gt;Dwight, Edwin Wells. 1818. ''Memoirs of Henry Obookiah…; who died at Cornwall, Connecticut, February 17, 1818''. Cited in Schütz p.88.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these books no longer exist. [[Samuel B. Ruggles]], one of the First Company of missionaries to Hawaii and a fellow student of `Ōpūkaha`ia at Cornwall, mentions in an 1819 letter that his own grammar was "much assisted by one which `Ōpūkaha`ia attempted to form." [[Elisha Scott Loomis|Elisha Loomis]], who was to be printer for the first mission, was inspired to join it by reading `Ōpūkaha`ia's memoirs, edited by Dwight in the year of his death from fever, over a year before the First Company set sail from [[Boston]].

`Ōpūkaha`ia planned to return to Hawaii himself to preach, but contracted [[typhus]] fever and died in 1818 in Cornwall at the age of 26.

In 1826 the Foreign Mission School was closed by a scandal – two interracial marriages were too much for Cornwall residents. But both the school and `Ōpūkaha`ia were a catalyst for the [[South Sandwich Islands|Sandwich Island]] Mission and for the first concentrated efforts to analyse the language.

==Re-interment==
In 1993, `Ōpūkaha`ia's family decided to return his body from his grave in Connecticut to Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Renner |first=Gerald |title=A Final Resting Place For Henry Opukahala |date=16 July 1993 |newspaper=Hartford Courant |url=http://articles.courant.com/1993-07-16/news/0000007271_1_hawaiian-homeland-remains-missionary |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Aug. 15, 1993, his remains were laid in a vault facing the sea at [[Kahikolu Church]] near the town of [[Napoopoo, Hawaii|Napo{{okina}}opo{{okina}}o]], Kona, on the Island of Hawaii. It was the third church established in Hawaii by missionaries inspired by Opukaha{{okina}}ia. Hawaii's churches observe the third Sunday in February as a day of commemoration in honor of its first Christian. A plaque at the Cornwall gravesite reads: "In July of 1993, the family of Henry Opukahaia took him home to Hawaii for interment at Kahikolu Congregational Church Cemetery, Napo'opo'o, Kona, Island of Hawaii. Henry's family expresses gratitude, appreciation and love to all who cared for and loved him throughout the past years. Ahahui O Opukahaia"

==Works==
Besides translating the [[Book of Genesis]] into Hawaiian, `Ōpūkaha`ia nearly completed a [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] dictionary, grammar, and spelling book. The ''Memoirs of Henry Obookiah'' were published in [[New York City]] in 1818 and have been republished by the Woman's Board of Missions for the Pacific Islands several times since the 1960s. They have recently republished the 195-year-old book with a new epilogue of how his body was returned to the Big Island of Hawaii, along with new photographs.&lt;ref&gt;http://henryobookiahmemoirs.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Niujie Mosques02.jpg|thumb|[[Niujie Mosque]] in [[Niujie]], Beijing]]
[[Beijing]] has a population of [[Hui people]]. As of 1982 the Hui are the largest ethnic minority group in Beijing.

==Demographics==
The 1982 census stated that 184,693 people in Beijing were Hui, making up around 2% of Beijing's total population and 57% of the population classified as [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minority]]. ''Village and Family in Contemporary China'', a 1980 study by William L. Parish and Martin K. Whyte, stated that there were 16,000 Muslims in Beijing. [[Dru C. Gladney]], author of ''Muslim Chinese: Ethnic Nationalism in the People's Republic'', wrote that based on the 1982 census, the 1980 study had "drastically" underestimated the number of Hui in Beijing.&lt;ref name=Gladneyp174&gt;[[Dru C. Gladney|Gladney]], p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_hJ9aht6nZQC&amp;pg=PA174 174].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
As of 1996 there was no published data based on the 1982 census which maps the distributions of Hui people in the city.&lt;ref name=Gladneyp174/&gt; The [[Niujie]] ("Oxen Street") community, as of 1996, has the city's highest Hui concentration.&lt;ref name=Gladneyp175&gt;[[Dru C. Gladney|Gladney]], p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_hJ9aht6nZQC&amp;pg=PA175 175].&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1996 other communities which have concentrations of Hui include [[Madian, Beijing|Madian]], [[Chaonei]], [[Chaowai]], [[Chongwai]], [[Haidian (neighborhood)|Haidian]], [[Sanlihe]],&lt;ref name=Gladneyp174/&gt; and [[Huashi, Beijing|Huashi]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

By 2002, Niujie had survived the massive development in Beijing since it was located away from the northern end of Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; By that year Madian's Hui population eroded due to redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[Dru C. Gladney]] stated that [[Chinese Islamic cuisine|Islamic restaurants]] are often indicators of where Hui in Beijing live.&lt;ref name=Gladneyp174175&gt;Gladney, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_hJ9aht6nZQC&amp;pg=PA174 174]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=_hJ9aht6nZQC&amp;pg=PA175 175].&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1996 within Beijing the Hui had operated hundreds of [[Chinese Islamic cuisine|Islamic restaurants]].&lt;ref name=Gladneyp174/&gt;

==Religion==
As of 2017 there were about 70 mosques in Beijing.&lt;ref name=Gladneyp174/&gt; Gladney wrote that the [[Niujie Mosque]] in Niujie serves hundreds of Hui families, and typically the presence of one Hui mosque would indicate that 500 Hui individuals or 100 Hui families live in the vicinity.&lt;ref name=Gladneyp175/&gt;

'''Ildar Amirovich Abdrazakov''' ({{lang-ru|Ильда́р Ами́рович Абдраза́ков}}; {{lang-ba|Абдразаҡов Илдар Әмир улы}}, ''Abdrazaqov İldar Ämir ulı''; born 26 September 1976) is a Russian [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] opera singer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mariinsky.rt.com/news/grammy.html "Mariinsky soloists win Grammies"], Mariinsky Theater, 14 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==

Abdrazakov was born in [[Ufa]], the capital of the [[Federal subjects of Russia|Republic]] of [[Bashkortostan]] within [[Russia]]. His elder brother, Askar, is also a professional operatic bass; they have performed together, most notably at the [[Washington National Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonexaminer.com/russian-bass-reprises-his-don-giovanni/article/2508684 "Russian Bass Reprises His Don Giovanni"], ''Washington Examiner'', 22 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were both artists: his mother a painter, and his father (deceased) a director. Joined the Bashkirian Opera and Ballet Theatre after graduating from the Ufa State Institute of Arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mikkelinmusiikkijuhlat.fi/en/esiintyjat/ildar-abdrazakov "Ildar Abdrazakov"], Gergiev Festival 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He won a number of vocal competitions in the late 1990s including the Moscow Grand Prix, the Glinka International Vocal Competition, the Rimsky-Korsakov International Competition, and the International Obrazova competition. Abdrazakov's 2000 win at the Maria Callas International Television Competition in [[Parma]] led to his recital debut at La Scala in 2001.

In 2014 he appeared as [[Feodor Chaliapin]] in the comedy film ''[[Yolki 1914]]''.

'''Kerrie Duff''' ([[née]] '''Engel''') (born 1966) is an Australian swimmer and Paralympic bronze medalist.

==Early life==
Born in Melbourne with [[spina bifida]], Engel attended Nepean Special School until the end of grade 2, at the age of seven. She then moved to the local primary school at Brandon Park Primary School in 1972 before moving to [[Brentwood Secondary College]]. In year 9 she transferred to [[Korowa Anglican Girls' School]].

==Competitive career==
In 1981, Engel was one of four Victorians chosen to compete in the First Invitational Junior Games at [[Newcastle Upon Tyne]], UK. The other juniors were Peta Jayne Goodwin, Rodney Young and Paul Stitt. When Engel returned to Australia, she had won many medals in swimming events and also track and field.&lt;ref name="hope"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adm.monash.edu/records-archives/assets/docs/pdf/monash-reporter/1984-07-04.pdf|title=Kerrie's our hope for the games|publisher=Monash Reporter|date=July 1984|accessdate=21 September 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that, she competed in the Melbourne Senior Nationals and began training a lot more after school. She was coached in swimming at North Lodge Swimming academy under June O'Doherty ('Mrs Boss') and track and field training was overseen by one of the senior Paravics athletes, Ivan Rasojovic.

While studying in year 10 she was selected to compete in the [[FESPIC Games]] in [[Sha Tin]], Hong Kong. She continued to train at Northlodge during the same era as [[Greg Fasala]] who was trained by [[Jim O'Doherty]] ('Boss') so the pool deck often held cheering kids watching both overseas athletes do time trials. Two PE teacher students, Paul and Tim Hannon, were the track coaches. At the same time she was coached at [[Monash University]]'s pool by the Paravics coaches, Greg Frost and then Brian where she met fellow wheelchair sports athletes. Engel swam at the same meet as Fasala when the First Australia Day Games occurred in Melbourne and remembers walking in the parade at the Glass House alongside the 'Mean Machine'.

She swam personal bests in freestyle and backstroke (100&amp;nbsp;m and 100&amp;nbsp;m) as well as track events, winning bronze and silver medals in swimming at [[FESPIC Games]]. [[Dawn Fraser]] was the team motivator and Engel recalls the Australian swimmer leading the 'Aussie, Aussie, Aussie' chant in the arena as the team made its entrance. Throughout her career, Engel competed in class 5, though she was borderline class 4, which was apparent when she swam against Sue at the border class between Victoria and South Australia in a few [[Mt Gambier, South Australia|Mt Gambier]] competitions.

The highlight of Engel's swimming career was representing Australia at the [[1984 Summer Paralympics]]. She won bronze in the 400&amp;nbsp;m Freestyle event in a personal best time of 7.11 in Class 5.

As a result of this, she represented students on [[Monash University]]'s Sports And Recreation Association Executive between 1984-1989 whilst undertaking her Bachelor of Arts. She was awarded a Full Blue in 1984 and inducted into the Monash University Hall of Fame in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adm.monash.edu/records-archives/archives/memo-archive/2004-2007/stories/20051207/sport.html|title=Record attendance at Sports Blues awards|publisher=Monash Memo|date=7 December 2005|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall Engel competed in four Senior National Games in the years 1981, 1984, 1986 and 1988.

==After the Paralympics==
Engel received special permission to join Northlodge A.U.S.S.I. when she was 23 although people generally needed to be over 30 to swim in MASTERS. She swam in a number of short and long meets with the Northlodge Neptune team.

Engel also had fun sharing her swimming skills by training Paravics' juniors, and playing a little bit of wheelchair tennis (in Frankston) and basketball (at Preston) but was happier in the pool. Her team contained other notable Paralympic swimmers such as [[Anne Currie]], who was also in the 1984 Paralympics, but competed on Long Island.
&lt;!--comment out for now until the text is cleaned up: The training efforts of Mrs Boss and [http://corporate.olympics.com.au/98F17202-5056-B031-6A4DEA7D15E3B01C Boss] resulted in a number of their squad members representing Australia. [[Currie]] competed in the 1984 Paralympics with the Australian contingent that went to Long Island in New York as did another amputee athlete, Graham. [http://odohertys.com.au/info/club-history (Boss)] competed in water polo at the 1956 Helsinki Olympics and loaned Engel his lucky kangaroo mascot during her own competitions.--&gt;
 
Although born with spina bifida, Engel swam against other athletes with paralysis and spinal injuries such as [[polio]] and [[cerebral palsy]].
She was Team Captain in the Perth Nationals.

In 1991, Engel received a Bachelor of Arts from [[Monash University]].&lt;ref name="confidence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confident-woman.com.au/confident-woman/2013/2/5/kerrie-duff-self-confidence-striving-and-not-yielding.html#comment19811527|title=Confident Woman – Kerrie Duff|publisher=Self-confidence Australia|date=5 February 2013|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to competitive swimming in 1994 while working at [[World Vision Australia]] to swim in Beijing's FESPIC Games and was pleased with swimming comparative and faster times to her 1983 personal best. She came away with 2 Gold and one Silver.

In 1999, she co-wrote the book ''Challenge and Hope: Disability, Disease and Trauma in the Developing World'' with Jill Burn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kerrie Engel|author2=Jill Burn|title=Challenge and Hope: Disability, Disease and Trauma in the Developing World|date=1 June 1999|publisher=World Vision Australia|isbn=978-1-875140-44-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engel is married and lives in Western Australia.&lt;ref name="confidence"/&gt; In 2014 she graduated with a Masters in Human Rights from [[Curtin University]].She gained her Cert IV TAE and runs Kerrie Duff Consulting [https://kerrieduffconsulting.com/]. In her spare time Engel enjoys sharing her life experiences at community events such as 2016 Anti Poverty Week or 2017 TedxPerth as a Living Book through [[The Human Library]] project.

'''Lee Wing-tat''' ({{zh-t|李永達}}; born 25 December 1955) was a Member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] (LegCo), returned by direct election as representative of the [[New Territories West]] constituency. He was the third Chairman of the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] (DP). He is seen as a conservative inside the party.

==Early life==
A Hakka, Lee was elected vice-chairman of [[the Hong Kong University Students' Union]] in 1979. He graduated from the Faculty of Science of the [[University of Hong Kong]] with a pass.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} He first participated in politics in the 1980s and was the Vice-Chairman of the [[Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood]] (ADPL). He was elected to the [[District Councils of Hong Kong|District Council]] and the [[Regional Council of Hong Kong|Regional Council]] in 1985 and 1986 respectively. He was a founding member of [[the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]].

In 1989, during the visit of [[Geoffrey Howe]] to Hong Kong, Lee protested at the conference and called Howe's speech "bullshit".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|gUZwgPGVeWA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee left the ADPL and formed the [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]], which developed into the Democratic Party in 1994. He was elected to the [[Legco]] in the same year. He once lost his seat in the 2000 election but was re-elected in 2004. He was vice-chairman of Democratic Party from 2002 to 2004 and was elected Chairman at the sixth AGM of the DP in succession to [[Yeung Sum]]. His challenger for the Chairman's post, [[Chan King-ming]], was elected Vice-Chairman instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong Democrats name new leader|publisher=RTHK|newspaper=[[NewsBank]]|date=12 December 2004|accessdate=22 April 2010|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=BBAB&amp;d_place=BBAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=106FB54E69C60E35&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chairmanship of Democratic Party==

===Chief Executive Election===
In May 2005, Lee declared his intention to run in the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2005|Hong Kong Chief Executive Election]], but only received 52 nominations and thus failed to get on the ballot. As a result, he withdrew from the election on 15 June. His participation in the election faced great criticisms within the party and the [[pro-democracy]] camp.

===Criticisms===
Lee was criticized for suppressing the second-tier members and "''[[Young Turks]]''" of the party. In early 2006, someone alleged to the ''[[Apple Daily]]'' that some senior members were involved in spying activities of China. The "suspects" were all Young Turks and included vice-chairman [[Chan King Ming]] and [[Gary Fan]]. The Young Turks later held a press conference to criticise the list of "suspects", with some even directly naming Lee as responsible.

===Departure===
Lee did not seek a second term as party chairman in the party's internal elections in December 2006.

==Views, policy positions and Legco voting==
In June 2010, he voted with the party in favour of the government’s [[Consultation Document on the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive and for Forming the LegCo in 2012|2012 constitutional reform package]], which included the late amendment by the Democratic Party – accepted by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Beijing government]] – to hold a popular vote for five new [[District Councils of Hong Kong|District Council]] [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]].&lt;ref&gt;Cheers and jeers for political reform vote, [[South China Morning Post|SCMP]], Gary Cheung, Albert Wong and Fanny WY Fung, 25 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

(December 9, 1579 &amp;ndash; November 3, 1639), was a [[Peru]]vian [[lay brother]] of the [[Dominican Order]] who was [[beatified]] in 1837 by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] and [[canonized]] in 1962 by [[Pope John XXIII]]. He is the patron saint of mixed-race people, barbers, innkeepers, public health workers, and all those seeking racial harmony.

He was noted for his work on behalf of the poor, establishing an [[orphanage]] and a children's [[hospital]]. He maintained an austere lifestyle, which included [[fasting]] and [[vegetarianism|abstaining from meat]]. Among the many miracles attributed to him were those of [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]], [[bilocation]], miraculous knowledge, instantaneous cures, and an ability to communicate with animals.

==Life==
'''Juan Martin de Porres Velázquez''' was born in the city of [[Lima]], in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], on December 9, 1579. He was the illegitimate son of a [[Spain|Spanish]] nobleman, Don Juan de Porres, and Ana Velázquez, a freed slave from [[Panama]], of African or possibly part [[Indigenous peoples in South America|Native American]] descent.&lt;ref name=ewb/&gt;&lt;ref name=aar&gt;[http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/st-martin-de-porres-first-black-saint-americas "St. Martin de Porres, the first black saint in the Americas", ''African American Registry.'']&lt;/ref&gt; He had a sister named Juana, born two years later in 1581. After the birth of his sister, the father abandoned the family.&lt;ref name=foley&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1188 Foley OFM, Leonard, "St. Martin de Porres", ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast'', (revised by Pat McCloskey OFM), Franciscan Media] {{ISBN|978-0-86716-887-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ana Velázquez supported her children by taking in laundry.&lt;ref name=fullerton&gt;[http://www.stmdp.org/about-the-school/who-was-saint-martin-de-porres Fullerton MLIS, Anne, "Who was St. Martin de Porres?", St. martin de Porres School, Oakland, CA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019105802/http://www.stmdp.org/about-the-school/who-was-saint-martin-de-porres |date=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in poverty and, when his mother could not support him, Martin was confided to a primary school for two years, and then placed with a barber/surgeon to learn the medical arts.&lt;ref name=aar/&gt; He spent hours of the night in prayer, a practice which increased as he grew older.

Under Peruvian law, descendants of Africans and Native Americans were barred from becoming full members of religious orders. The only route open to Martin was to ask the Dominicans of Holy Rosary Priory in Lima to accept him as a ''donado'', a volunteer who performed menial tasks in the monastery in return for the privilege of wearing the habit and living with the religious community.&lt;ref name=craughwell&gt;[https://www.franciscanmedia.org/patron-saints-for-modern-challenges Craughwell, Thomas J., "Patron Saints for Modern Challenges"]&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 15 he asked for admission to the Dominican Convent of the Rosary in Lima and was received first as a servant boy, and as his duties grew he was promoted to [[almoner]].

Martin continued to practice his old trades of barbering and healing and was said to have performed many miraculous cures. He also took on kitchen work, laundry, and cleaning. After eight years at Holy Rosary, the [[prior]] Juan de Lorenzana, decided to turn a blind eye to the law and permit Martin to take his vows as a member of the [[Third Order of Saint Dominic]]. Holy Rosary was home to 300 men, not all of whom accepted the decision of De Lorenzana: one of the novices called Martin a "[[mulatto]] dog", while one of the priests mocked him for being illegitimate and descended from slaves.&lt;ref name=craughwell/&gt;

When Martin was 24, he was allowed to profess [[religious vows]] as a Dominican lay brother in 1603. He is said to have several times refused this elevation in status, which may have come about due to his father's intervention, and he never became a priest.&lt;ref name=ewb/&gt; It is said that when his [[convent]] was in debt, he implored them: "I am only a poor mulatto, sell me." Martin was deeply attached to the [[Blessed Sacrament]], and he was praying in front of it one night when the step of the altar he was kneeling on caught fire. Throughout all the confusion and chaos that followed, he remained where he was, unaware of what was happening around him.&lt;ref&gt;Biography in ''The Saint Martin De Porres Prayer Book'', pp. 147-152.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martin of porres.jpeg|left|thumb|A mid-twentieth century stained glass representation of Martin de Porres in [[St Pancras Church, Ipswich]] with a broom, rosary, parrot and monkey]]
When Martin was 34, after he had been given the [[religious habit]] of a lay brother, he was assigned to the [[infirmary]], where he was placed in charge and would remain in service until his death at the age of 59. He was known for his care of the sick.&lt;ref name=aar/&gt; His superiors saw in him the virtues necessary to exercise unfailing patience in this difficult role. It was not long before miracles were attributed to him. Martin also cared for the sick outside his convent, often bringing them healing with only a simple glass of water. He ministered without distinction to Spanish nobles and to slaves recently brought from Africa.&lt;ref name=ewb&gt;[http://www.notablebiographies.com/supp/Supplement-Mi-So/Porres-Mart-n.html "Martin Porres", Encyclopedia of World Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; One day an aged beggar, covered with ulcers and almost naked, stretched out his hand, and Martin took him to his own bed. One of his brethren reproved him. Martin replied: "Compassion, my dear Brother, is preferable to cleanliness."

When an epidemic struck Lima, there were in this single Convent of the Rosary 60 friars who were sick, many of them novices in a distant and locked section of the convent, separated from the professed. Martin is said to have passed through the locked doors to care for them, a phenomenon which was reported in the residence more than once. The professed, too, saw him suddenly beside them without the doors having been opened. Martin continued to transport the sick to the convent until the [[provincial superior]], alarmed by the contagion threatening the friars, forbade him to continue to do so. His sister, who lived in the country, offered her house to lodge those whom the residence of the religious could not hold. One day he found on the street a poor Indian, bleeding to death from a dagger wound, and took him to his own room until he could transport him to his sister's hospice. The prior, when he heard of this, reprimanded him for disobedience. He was extremely edified, however, by his reply: "Forgive my error, and please instruct me, for I did not know that the precept of obedience took precedence over that of charity."&lt;ref name=granger&gt;Granger O.P., Fr. Arthur M., ''Vie du Bienheureux Martin de Porrès'', Dominican Press: St. Hyacinthe, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;  The prior gave him liberty thereafter to follow his inspirations in the exercise of mercy.

Martin did not eat meat. He begged for alms to procure necessities the convent could not provide.&lt;ref name=granger/&gt; In normal times, Martin succeeded with his alms to feed 160 poor persons every day, and distributed a remarkable sum of money every week to the [[indigent]]. Side by side with his daily work in the kitchen, laundry and infirmary, Martin's life is said to have reflected extraordinary gifts: ecstasies that lifted him into the air, light filling the room where he prayed, bilocation, miraculous knowledge, instantaneous cures and a remarkable rapport with animals.&lt;ref name=foley/&gt; He founded a residence for orphans and abandoned children in the city of Lima.&lt;ref name=foley/&gt;

==Death and commemoration==
[[File:Convento Santo Domingo - Lima.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The [[Basilica and Convent of Santo Domingo]], where de Porres is buried, in [[Lima]], [[Peru]]]]
Martin was a friend of both St. [[John Macias|Juan Macías]], a fellow Dominican lay brother, and St. [[Rose of Lima]], a lay Dominican. By the time he died, on November 3, 1639, he had won the affection and respect of many of his fellow Dominicans as well as a host of people outside the priory.&lt;ref name=craughwell/&gt; Word of his miracles had made him known as a saint throughout the region. As his body was displayed to allow the people of the city to pay their respects, each person snipped a tiny piece of his habit to keep as a relic. It is said that three habits were taken from the body. His body was then interred in the grounds of the monastery.

After De Porres died, the miracles and graces received when he was invoked multiplied in such profusion that his body was exhumed after 25 years and said to be found intact, and exhaling a fine fragrance. Letters to Rome pleaded for his beatification; the decree affirming the heroism of his virtues was issued in 1763 by [[Pope Clement XIII]].

Pope Gregory XVI beatified Martin de Porres on October 29, 1837, and nearly 125 years later, Pope John XXIII canonized him in Rome on May 6, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsouth.org/about-us/st-martin-de-porres/ Dorcy, Jean Marie. "St. Martin de Porres", ''St. Dominic's Family'',  Tan Books and Publishers, 1983]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the [[patron saint]] of people of [[mixed race]], and of [[innkeeper]]s, barbers, [[public health]] workers and more, with a [[feast day]] on November 3.

Martin is also commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the [[Church of England]] on November 3.

He is recognised as ''Papa Candelo'' in the [[Afro-Caribbean]]-Catholic [[syncretism|syncretist]] religion, which is practised in places where [[African diaspora]] culture thrives such as [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Cuba]], the [[United States]], and his native Peru.

==Iconography==
[[File:San Martín de Porres - Reconstrucción Facial 3D.jpg|thumb|Forensic facial reconstruction of Martin de Porres]]
Martin de Porres is often depicted as a young mulatto [[friar]] wearing the old habit of the Dominican lay brother, a black [[scapular]] and [[hood (headgear)|capuce]], along with a [[broom]], since he considered all work to be sacred no matter how menial. He is sometimes shown with a dog, a cat and a mouse eating in peace from the same dish.

==Legacy==
Martin's sometimes defiant attachment to the ideal of social justice achieved deep resonance in a church attempting to carry forward that ideal in today's modern world.&lt;ref name=ewb/&gt;

Today, Martin is commemorated by, among other things, a school building that houses the [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Medicine and Surgery|medical]], [[University of Santo Tomas College of Nursing|nursing]], and [[University of Santo Tomas College of Rehabilitation Sciences|rehabilitation science]] schools of the Dominican [[University of Santo Tomas]] in the [[Philippines]].
A programme of work is also named after him at the Las Casas Institute at [[Blackfriars Hall]], University of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfriars.ox.ac.uk/casas_intro.php Las Casas Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709191728/http://www.bfriars.ox.ac.uk/casas_intro.php |date=2013-07-09 }} at Blackfriars Hall website&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also the titular saint of the parish of St. Martin de Porres in Poughkeepsie, NY,&lt;ref&gt;[http://stmartindeporres.org/ St. Martin de Porres Parish] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312072748/http://www.stmartindeporres.org/home.html|date=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some elementary schools. A number of Catholic churches are named after him.

==In popular culture==
In the 1980 novel ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]'', Ignatius Reilly contemplates praying to Martin for aid in bringing social justice to the black workers at the New Orleans factory where he works. In music, the first track of jazz pianist [[Mary Lou Williams]]'s album ''Black Christ of the Andes'' is titled "St. Martin De Porres."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folkways.si.edu/TrackDetails.aspx?itemid=42448 Smithsonian Folkways]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several Spanish and Mexican works regarding his life in cinema and television, starring Cuban actor Rene Muñoz, the most of them referring to his mulatto origin, his miracles and his life of humility. The most known movies are ''Fray Escoba'' (''Friar Broom'') (1963)&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|54895|Fray Escoba}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Un mulato llamado Martin'' (''A mulatto called Martin'') (1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|217670|Un mulato llamado Martín}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Moone Boy]]'' episode "Godfellas", the character Martin Moon is shown to be named by his grandfather after San Martin De Porres. His grandfather is unable to actually remember any of San Martin's accomplishments, and simply refers to him as "one of the black ones" when asked about him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5980">'''Milton John Cross''' (April 16, 1897 – January 3, 1975) was an American radio announcer famous for his work on the [[NBC]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] radio networks.

He was best known as the voice of the [[Metropolitan Opera]], hosting its [[Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts|Saturday afternoon radio broadcasts]] for 43 years, from the time of their inception on December 25, 1931 until his death in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fritz|first=Jose|url=http://tenwatts.blogspot.com/2007/12/milton-cross.html|title=A Milton Cross Christmas|work=Arcane Radio Trivias|date=December 27, 2007|accessdate=December 27, 2007|quote=He was the announcer for the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts on WABC-AM for 43 years. That's from their first program in 1931 until his death in 1975.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early career===
Born in [[New York City]], Milton Cross started his career just as network radio itself was in its earliest stages. He joined the New Jersey station [[WABC (AM)|WJZ]] in 1921, not just as an announcer but also as a singer, often engaging in recitals with the station's staff pianist, [[Keith McLeod]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Daily News'', September 8, 1926&lt;/ref&gt; By 1927, WJZ had moved to Manhattan and had become the flagship station of the [[Blue Network]] of NBC's new national radio network. Cross' voice became familiar as he not only delivered announcements for the Blue Network but also hosted a number of popular programs. Cross was the announcer for the quiz program ''[[Information Please]]'' and the musical humor show ''[[The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street]]'', among others. In the 1940s Cross hosted a Sunday morning show featuring child performers, called ''Coast To Coast on a Bus''.

===Metropolitan Opera broadcasts===
From 1931 to 1975 Cross served as host for the weekly live broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera, the job for which he is most remembered. His distinctive voice conveyed the excitement of live performances "from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City" for generations of radio listeners. Initially, he broadcast from a seat in "Box 44" at the old [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th St)|Metropolitan Opera House]] at Broadway and 40th Street. In 1966, he introduced the radio audience to the Met's new [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|home at Lincoln Center]] as he hosted a special broadcast of the opening night performance from a modern radio booth in the new house.

For 43 seasons he was the main (usually sole) commentator. In the 1930s he shared some broadcasts with other commentators, such as Deems Taylor, John B. Kennedy and Marcia Davenport, and Robert Woldrop replaced him (for unknown reasons) for the April 3, 1937 broadcast of ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' and the May 15, 1937 broadcast of ''Mignon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Paul|title=Saturday Afternoons at the Old Met|date=1992|publisher=Amadeus Press|location=Portland, OR|isbn=9780931340482|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also missed two later broadcasts (''[[Rigoletto]]'' – February 10, 1973 and ''Norma'' – February 17, 1973) due to the death of his wife. Cross never retired but died in New York from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] during the Met season of 1974–75. His first Met broadcast was Hansel and Gretel on December 25, 1931 and his last was of ''[[Turandot]]'' on December 28, 1974, 43 years and 3 days later. He was succeeded by [[Peter Allen (US broadcaster)|Peter Allen]], who had been his standby announcer.

A native New Yorker, Cross died in New York City where he had lived all his life. He is interred at [[Kensico Cemetery]] in Valhalla, New York.

==Books and recordings==
Cross edited several popular editions of opera synopses, published in conjunction with the Met broadcasts. He also co-authored (with David Ewen) ''Milton Cross' Encyclopedia of the Great Composers and their Music'' – a set of biographies of 78 composers, published in 1953 by Doubleday &amp; Co.

Cross was also featured as narrator on several records, including:
* ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', 4 78-rpm discs, c. 1950, [[Musicraft Records]] M 65 302–305&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.honkingduck.com/discography/discog_artist.php?like=MILTON%20CROSS Recordings by Milton Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Milton Cross Explains'', 2 discs each, [[Ottenheimer Publishers]]/Cabot Records 1958&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minigroove.nl/english37.html Classical music on children's records]&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''The Instruments of the Orchestra'' CAB 4021
** ''The Magic of Music'' CAB 4022

==Popular culture==
Cross was parodied in [[Peter Schickele]]'s album, ''[[P. D. Q. Bach]]: [[The Stoned Guest (album)|The Stoned Guest]]''. [[Will Jordan]] played the role of "Milton Host", the host, who gave the commentary and told the listener what the synopsis of the act for the opera was.  
An earlier parody of Cross came in the character of "Doktor Quilton Foss" in ''[[G.I. Carmen]]'', an all-soldier musical stage production of the U.S. Army.  Billed as "the Boilesk Voishin" the show toured occupied Europe from June 9, 1945 through January 24, 1946.  Again the host, "Foss" introduced the show and offered commentary throughout the evening's proceedings.

'''Morton A. Klein''' is a German-born American economist, statistician, and pro-Israeli activist. He is the president of the [[Zionist Organization of America]] (ZOA) and is regarded as one of the leading Jewish activists in the United States. In 2004, he was named one of the top five Jewish leaders in the US today by [[The Forward]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bechollashon.org/heart/index.php/articles/3313|title=THE FORWARD 50; Lead Players on a Global Stage|website=bechollashon.org|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US Department of State]] awarded Klein a “Certificate of Appreciation” “in recognition of outstanding contributions to national and international affairs.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.israeliamerican.org/iac-national-conference/team-member/morton-klein&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Klein traveled to Qatar on a paid trip and he accepted $100,000 in contributions to the ZOA from Qatar lobbyist [[Joey Allaham]].

Marcus, the assistant secretary of education for civil rights to open a seven-year-old case brought by the [[Zionist Organization of America]] against [[Rutgers University]] as a "groundbreaking decision."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/us/politics/rutgers-jewish-education-civil-rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;. The case will examine whether or not Rutgers allowed a hostile environment for Jewish students. Klein is a published academic, having served as a lecturer at Temple University in addition to serving as a biostatistician at UCLA School of Public Health and the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.israeliamerican.org/iac-national-conference/team-member/morton-klein|title=Morton A.

== Early life and career ==
Klein is a child of [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors, born in a displaced persons camp in Gunzberg, Germany.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/26/nyregion/public-lives-in-favor-of-the-war-and-enjoying-a-good-fight.html|title=PUBLIC LIVES; In Favor of the War, and Enjoying a Good Fight|last=Wakin|first=Daniel J.|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 4 years old, he and his family emigrated from Germany to the United States, where he would grow up in South Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He is an economist who served in the Nixon, Ford, and Carter Administrations. He has served as a biostatistician at [[UCLA School of Public Health]] and the [[Linus Pauling Institute]] of Science and Medicine in [[Palo Alto]], Calif. He has been a lecturer in mathematics and statistics at [[Temple University]].&lt;ref name="Morton Klein"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoa.org/content/klein.asp|title=National President Morton A. Klein|date=2010-12-14|publisher=ZOA.org|accessdate=2010-12-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202061237/http://www.zoa.org/content/klein.asp|archivedate=2010-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Klein is member of the International Board of Governors of the [[Ariel University Center of Samaria]].&lt;ref name="Morton Klein" /&gt;

His father was a [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar ''chasid'']], an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Rabbi]] with ''[[semicha]]'' from [[Moshe Teitelbaum (Satmar)|Moshe Teitelbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/39823|title=Morton Klein: Bibi Sent Wrong Message,Elliot Resnick, Jewish Press Staff Reporter|date=2009-06-24|publisher=Jewishpress.com|accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein said in a [[Jewish Press]] interview regarding his father that "In Europe he had a long beard and black hat and was a ''[[rosh yeshiva]]'' in his early 20s. But he disagreed with the Satmars on Israel.  My father loved Israel, so obviously this was transmitted to me."&lt;ref&gt;June 26, '09, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

He was motivated to enter pro-Israel work while watching the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]] in 1993, telling [[Haaretz]], “I only went into the work because I thought Oslo was a disastrous mistake and I wanted a podium to express that. I did not intend to do it for more than a year or two, make my case and then go back to normal life. But things kept getting worse, not better.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/how-morton-klein-went-from-fringe-figure-to-white-house-player-1.5627699|title=Steve Bannon's Best Jewish Friend: Morton Klein's Rise to Prominence in the Trump Era|date=2017-12-06|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zionist Organization of America==
In 1993, while serving as the organization's Philadelphia chapter president, Klein was elected national president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Popper |first=Nathaniel |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/1227 |title=ZOA Pressed by Former Officials Over Guard's Pay – The Jewish Daily Forward |publisher=Forward.com |date=2006-04-14 |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ZOA web site quotes the following from Klein's [[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] entry: "Klein revived a moribund Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) in the 1990s and made it one of the most outspoken organizations on the American Jewish scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zoa.org/media/user/documents/Publ/ZOAReportFall2008.pdf |title=4819-ZOA Report FL08.p5 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605111048/http://www.zoa.org/media/user/documents/Publ/ZOAReportFall2008.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Obama administration abstained from using its veto power to block [[United Nations Security Council Resolution]] 2334 which stated that [[Israeli Settlement]] in the [[West Bank]] is a 'flagrant' violation of international law, Klein called Obama "a Jew-hating antisemite."&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Beaumont (journalist)|Peter Beaumont]], [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/24/israel-rejects-shameful-un-resolution-amid-criticism-of-netanyahu Israel rejects 'shameful' UN resolution amid criticism of Netanyahu,'] [[The Guardian]] 24 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein has stated his belief that the U.S. should engage in religious profiling of Muslims. "In an era in which the vast majority of terrorism is committed by Muslims, in order to protect American citizens, we should adopt the same profiling policies as Israel and be more thorough in vetting Muslims," he told the Forward. Klein said he would also support profiling of Jews under certain circumstances. "If most terror were committed by Jews I would support profiling Jews."&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/343103/zoa-leader-supports-trumps-call-for-profiling-muslims/?attribution=home-hero-item-text-1 ZOA Leader Supports Trump’s Call for Profiling Muslims] The Forward, June 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the ZOA lost its tax-exempt status from the [[Internal Revenue Service]] after it failed to file tax returns for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/news/162607/zoas-uncertain-status/?p=all|title=ZOA's Uncertain Status|newspaper=The Forward|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ZOA regained its status in May 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/alleging-corruption-vp-bids-to-oust-klein-in-zoa-vote/|title=Alleging mismanagement, VP bids to oust longtime head of US Zionist group|last=Ghert-Zand|first=Renee|date=|newspaper=The Times of Israel|access-date=2017-02-09|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein said it was a technical "glitch."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the years that the ZOA failed to file tax returns, [[The Forward]] reported that Klein's salary increased 38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/news/163407/zoas-mort-klein-gets-38-pay-hike/?p=all|title=ZOA's Mort Klein Gets 38% Pay Hike|newspaper=The Forward|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Steven Goldberg, a Los Angeles attorney and national vice-president of the ZOA, launched a challenge to Klein's presidency, alleging that Klein was mismanaging the ZOA and personally profiting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Klein was later reelected president with 93% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/morton-klein-reelected-zoa-national-president/|title=Morton Klein reelected ZOA national president|newspaper=The Times of Israel|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his work with the ZOA, Klein was named one of the top dozen “Jewish activists of the century.” The NY Jewish Week ( largest Federation paper) has named him one of the top ten Jewish leaders who have made a difference. The Jewish Press recently stated that “Morton Klein is one of the best minds in this country.”&lt;ref&gt;https://zoa.org/about/morton-a-klein/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fighting BDS==
Klein is an active voice against the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement against [[Israel]], having once even spoken to the issue in an address to the [[Israeli Knesset]].&lt;ref&gt;https://zoa.org/2014/07/10249460-video-of-zoa-president-morton-klein-addressing-knesset-about-the-importance-of-language-in-fighting-bds/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Through the [[Zionist Organization of America]], Klein call on the [[University of Michigan]]'s President and Board of Regents to publicly condemn and severely sanction Professor John Cheney-Lippold after he rescinded an offer to write a letter of recommendation for a student, simply because the student planned to study at a university in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;https://thejewishnews.com/2018/09/27/update-israel-bias-john-cheney-lippold-study-abroad/&lt;/ref&gt; Morton Klein and Susan B. Tuchman, Esq., Director of the ZOA’s Center for Law and Justice, urged the University leadership to take strong and decisive action against Cheney-Lippold:  “The University’s leadership expressed its disappointment in Cheney-Lippold’s actions, but that’s not enough.  President Schlissel and the Board of Regents must publicly condemn Cheney-Lippold for violating the University’s policies, and severely sanction him for his wrongdoing. Cheney-Lippold cannot be allowed to impose his political agenda on students to impede them from pursuing the academic opportunities of their choosing.  If the University leaders fail to take action against Cheney-Lippold, then they will be sending the message to him and to the rest of the faculty that they are free to use their power to violate students’ academic freedom and stand in the way of students studying what they want and where they want."&lt;ref&gt;https://thejewishnews.com/2018/09/27/zoa-letter-to-university-of-michigan-president-and-regents/&lt;/ref&gt;

In a January 18, 2018 article in the Jewish News Syndicate Klein noted that "Israel’s decision to finally ban 20 of the worst organizations leading the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement is necessary for the country’s security, and is sensible and just. BDS is a political and economic warfare movement, often combined with violence and intimidation, that is aimed at eradicating the Jewish state. No sovereign nation should permit the entry of those dedicated to its destruction. Israel, like every nation, has a duty to protect itself. BDS groups and leaders enter Israel to harm the country and its people. They instigate and join weekly violent and disruptive anti-Israel demonstrations, during which they throw rocks at the soldiers serving in the IDF and at Jewish civilians."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jns.org/opinion/banning-bds-groups-from-entering-israel-is-necessary-and-just/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fighting anti-Semitism===
Following the [[Pittsburgh synagogue shooting]] the [[Zionist Organization of America]] released a sprawling press release about the need to combat anti-Semitism in all forms. Klein is quoted in the release stating: " It is time to wake up, and for the leaders of all Jewish organizations, Christian and Muslim organizations, local and national government, university and media leaders and social media professionals to meet and join together, and to join with ZOA, in condemning, clamping down on, and countering the daily anti-Semitic activities that the world remains largely silent about, and the evil lies spread against Jews and the Jewish state that are feeding into an atmosphere that encourages and legitimizes attacks on Jews. ZOA urges President Trump to make a major public address on anti-Semitism and bigotry, and quickly fill the post of the head of the government department responsible for fighting anti-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;https://zoa.org/2018/10/10378852-zoa-horrified-by-and-mourns-pittsburgh-massacre-of-11-innocent-jews-urges-others-join-zoa-to-condemn-and-counter-those-creating-atmosphere-of-jew-hatred/&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Qatar controversy===
In January 2018, Klein went on a paid trip to Qatar at the invitation of the Emir, part of Qatar's public relations efforts to change its reputation within the U.S. Jewish community and the Trump administration. During his visit, he met with a number of senior officials in the country, including the Emir. His visit received "strong criticism from other supporters of Israel, who warned that the Qataris were using 'pro-Israel' names to whitewash their support for Hamas and other terror organizations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=January 30, 2018 |title=Why Did ZOA's Morton Klein Go to Qatar? 'I Talked With the Emir About Hamas and Al Jazeera' |url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-why-did-zoa-s-mort-klein-go-to-qatar-at-the-emir-s-invitation-1.5771242 |work=Haaretz }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=January 30, 2018 |title=ZOA president: I went to Qatar for Israel and the Jewish people |url=https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Zionist-Org-president-I-went-to-Qatar-for-Israel-and-the-Jewish-people-540244 |work=The Jerusalem Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 2018, ''Mother Jones'' reported that Qatar had donated $100,000 to the ZOA through lobbyist [[Joey Allaham]]. Allaham first contributed $50,000 to the ZOA on November 2, 2017,&lt;ref name="mojo2"&gt;{{cite news |date=June 19, 2018 |title=Mike Huckabee Praised Qatar Without Revealing He Was Paid $50,000 by Qatar |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/06/mike-huckabee-praised-qatar-without-revealing-he-was-paid-50000-by-qatar/ |work=Mother Jones }}&lt;/ref&gt; shortly before the group's annual gala on November 17 in which former Qatari diplomat [[Ahmed Al-Rumaihi]] was present, at the invitation of Allaham.&lt;ref name="mojo1"&gt;{{cite news |date=June 13, 2018 |title=How the King of New York Kosher Restaurants Helped Qatar Win Over American Jewish Leaders |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/06/joey-allaham-nick-muzin-qatar-jewish-leaders/ |work=Mother Jones }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second $50,000 contribution from Allaham to the ZOA came on January 23, 2018, a few weeks after Klein visited Doha.&lt;ref name="mojo2"/&gt; Klein had been under the impression that the money came from Allaham's own pocket, and later had ZOA return the funds when it was discovered otherwise. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/qatar-used-pro-israel-businessman-to-pay-zionist-group-100000-report/&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein's liaisons with Qatar coincided with the softening of his and the ZOA's tough stance against Qatar. In 2014, for instance, "the organization urged the US government to designate Qatar as a state sponsor of terrorism for 'funding and promoting Nazi-like organizations that want to kill every Jew.' ... In June 2017, Klein's ZOA had renewed its demand for the State Department to brand Qatar terrorists and had called on the Federal Aviation Authority to bar Qatar Airways from flying in the United States."&lt;ref name="mojo1"/&gt; In September 2017, Klein announced that he had refused an invitation to meet with the "pro-Hamas Emir of the State of Qatar" on the sidelines of the [[Seventy-second session of the United Nations General Assembly|2017 United Nations General Assembly]]. He added that rather than change any of its "monstrous and evil actions, Qatar may be trying to create the optical illusion of Jewish support to moderate their image by hiring a well-connected PR firm and by having 'secret' meetings with Jewish leaders – which of course won't be a secret, as the whole reason for the meetings may be for the Qataris to point to them as evidence that the 'Jews' (and thus Israel) don't view them as enemies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=September 12, 2017 |title=ZOA's Klein Does Not Accept Invitation to Meet with Qatar's Pro-Hamas Emir |url=https://zoa.org/2017/09/10374796-zoas-morton-klein-will-not-meet-with-qatars-emir-and-crown-prince/ |agency=Zionist Organization of America }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 20, 2018, shortly after Klein's paid trip to Qatar and just three days before the second $50,000 payment Allaham gave to ZOA on behalf of Qatar, Klein expressed to ''Haaretz'' a new, open attitude to dialogue with Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=January 20, 2018 |title=Qatar Doubles Down on PR Campaign Appealing to U.S. Jews and D.C.

On June 6, 2018, the day a federal judge ruled that Joey Allaham "must turn over any records showing ties to the government of Qatar,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=June 6, 2018 |title=Trump's Friend Elliott Broidy to Get Information in Case Against Qatar |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-07/trump-friend-broidy-to-get-information-in-case-against-qatar |agency=Bloomberg News }}&lt;/ref&gt; which would expose later that month his contributions to the ZOA using Qatari money, Klein denounced Qatar for having "taken some alarming steps backwards" and said that he "plan[s] to discuss these serious concerns with my contacts with Members of the House and Senate and the Administration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=June 6, 2018 |title=ZOA: Qatar's Giant Steps Backwards to Becoming a Member of the Family of Civilized Nations |url=https://zoa.org/2018/06/10378144-zoa-qatars-giant-steps-backwards-to-becoming-a-member-of-the-family-of-civilized-nations/ |agency=Zionist Organization of America }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=June 7, 2018 |title=Key figures in Gulf crisis sever ties with Qatar |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/07/qatar-persian-gulf-630039 |work=Politico }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=June 13, 2018 |title=Qatar's Efforts to Influence American Jews Continue to Unravel |url=https://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/264132/qatars-efforts-to-influence-american-jews-continue-to-unravel |work=Tablet }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allaham told ''The Jerusalem Post'' on June 21 that he is "proud of the work that Mort Klein has done and all the other Jewish leaders working in collaboration with the Emir and other members of the Qatari Royal Family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=June 21, 2018 |title=How Qatar's Jewish strategy backfired |url=https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/How-Qatars-Jewish-strategy-backfired-560586 |work=The Jerusalem Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict with Rutgers==
On September 11, 2018 it was reported in the [[New York Times]] that Kenneth L. Marcus, the assistant secretary of education for civil rights reopened a seven-year-old case brought by the [[Zionist Organization of America]] against [[Rutgers University]], saying the Obama administration, in closing the case, ignored evidence that suggested the school allowed a hostile environment for Jewish students&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/us/politics/rutgers-jewish-education-civil-rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;. In a statement on the decision, Klein and Susan B. Tuchman, the director of its Center for Law and Justice noted:

“It took a leader like Kenneth Marcus to finally decide the ZOA’s appeal and to also make it clear that O.C.R. will finally be using a definition of anti-Semitism that makes sense and that reflects how anti-Semitism is so frequently expressed today, particularly on our college campuses,” they wrote. “Hate groups like Students for Justice in Palestine try to convince others that their attacks on Zionism and Israel are legitimate political discourse. But as the State Department definition of anti-Semitism recognizes, these attacks are often a mask for Jew-hatred, plain and simple.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/us/politics/rutgers-jewish-education-civil-rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2018 in the [[Tampa Bay Times]], again while addressing the decision to reopen the case, Klein stated: "It's really a breakthrough. Israel bashing and anti-Zionism can cross a line when it becomes anti-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tampabay.com/trumps-education-department-weighs-in-on-anti-semitism-case-ap_national7f5b61cc1d384dbfacd871a30da9502e&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media Appearances==
Klein has appeared on TV and radio including ABC’s World News Tonight (4 minute segment on ZOA “Lobbying for Israel”), NBC National News, Jim Lehrer News Hour, O’Reilly Factor, CNN, Fox-TV, CNBC, MSNBC, NPR, BBC, C-Span, VOA, Israel TV/Radio. Lines from his speeches appear in the respected volume entitled “Great Jewish Quotations,” He is on the speaker’s bureau of UJC, and Israel Bonds.&lt;ref&gt;https://zoa.org/about/morton-a-klein/&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 24, 2018, through the [[Zionist Organization of America]], Klein issued a statement calling for [[David Hogg (activist)|David Hogg]] to re-name his book. Klein noted that "This inappropriate title displays an unkind and shocking insensitivity to Holocaust survivors, Jews, and all decent, human-rights-loving people around the world. Any attempts to compare the genocide of the Holocaust to modern domestic political issues in the US today is shameful and wrong.”&lt;ref&gt;http://jewishjournal.com/tag/morton-klein/&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein, on a number of occasions, has called for 'free nations' to leave the United Nations Human Right Council citing it's "perpetual preoccupation with condemning Israel."

Following [[Nikki Haley]]'s plan to resign from her position as the United States ambassador to the United Nations on October 9, 2018, Klein in the [[Times of Israel]] called Haley's resignation "a huge loss … a loss for the pro-Israel world and a loss for American foreign policy. She has been a tremendous friend. She was a main factor in putting the Palestinians on notice that if they don’t change their pro-terrorist policies, they will get nothing. She has created a situation where the Palestinians seriously should consider their stances and policies.”&lt;ref&gt;https://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/haleys-resignation-a-huge-loss-for-pro-israel-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, Klein has been critical of the 'two-state solution' concept noting that Israel is already a sovereign state. In a April 2, 2013 article in the Jerusalem Post Klein wrote: "This mantra “two-state solution” falsely implies – even claims – that Israel is not yet a state, that it is not a sovereign, independent, UN-sanctioned state until and unless a Palestinian state comes into being alongside it. If this were not the implication, why would anyone be promoting the term “twostate solution”? It also falsely implies that both sides are getting the same thing. Yet Israel is already a state and its legitimacy stands independent of whatever political solution might one day emerge."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Stop-using-misleading-term-two-state-solution-308354&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Commentary==
Klein is a frequent commentator on political matters, particularly when Jewish peoples or Israel is the topic of discussion. Notably, Klein took issue with a tweet made by [[Ann Coulter]] during the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016]] where she stated: "How many f-ing Jews do these people think there are in the US." In response, Klein stated in the Jerusalem Post: "Last night, Ann Coulter made appalling, anti-Jewish remarks which evoked the classic, anti-Semitic trope about Jewish manipulation of America for the purposes of supporting Israel at America's expense. When GOP candidates speak of strengthening the US-Israel relationship which has been harmed by President [Barack] Obama within the context of the need to ensure that Iran doesn't go nuclear; to strengthen America's hand in the world when dealing with vicious totalitarian enemies who seek the demise of the US, they are defending America's interests,"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Barring-apology-right-wing-Zionists-demand-Fox-News-fire-Ann-Coulter-for-f-ing-Jews-tweet-416567&lt;/ref&gt;   

Following the 2018 [[Zionist Organization of America]] dinner Klein stated it was "political blasphemy" to place any onus for the 11 murdered in a Pittsburgh synagogue on the president or his heated rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thedailybeast.com/maga-themed-zionist-organization-of-america-dinner-shows-split-between-american-jews/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mulla Ali Kani''' ({{lang-fa|ملا علی کنی}}, (1888–1805) was an Iranian Shia muslim [[scholars]], [[philosopher]] and from individuals [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kani-haj-molla-ali Encyclopædia Iranica ḤĀJ MOLLĀ ʿALI KANI]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oral-history.ir/?page=post&amp;id=4136 3rd Iran and British Colonization Confab calls for papers]&lt;/ref&gt; He was in charge of religious affairs of Iran, and had a great influence on people and even on [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] and his court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft0f59n6r9&amp;chunk.id=d0e12594&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e11323&amp;brand=ucpress 8 Clericalist Monarchy and Shi‘i Institution Building - California Digital Library]&lt;/ref&gt;
After the singing  of the [[Reuter concession]] in 1873 which in practice made Iran a colony of Britain, Mulla Ali Kani wrote a letter to the King, Nasir al-Din Shah, and opposed  this contract. He wrote that what Reuter gains through this contract even is more than what Britain gained in India. He also wrote that when there is a flaw in governmental affairs, it is religious scholars' duty to refer to it whether the king favor this or not and whether tries to correct it or not" and strongly asked the king to cancel the contract and dismiss the prime minister, who was behind signing this contract. As a result of these objections and even foreign objections to the contract, at last, Nasir al-Din Shah canceled the contract and removed the minister from the office.&lt;ref&gt;Taymuri, 'Asr bi-khabari, p.123-126; Nazim al-Islam Kirmani, Tarikh biydari Iranian, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;
Kani died in [[Tehran]], 1888 and was buried in the shrine of [[Shah-Abdol-Azim shrine]] in Rey.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel G. W. Benjamin, Persia and the Persians, London, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 2002, a 50-year-old grandmother, Margaret Gall, was found dead in the lounge room of her home in [[Raymond Terrace]], a town in the [[Hunter Region]] in the Australian state of [[New South Wales]].

The crime remains unsolved, and the [[New South Wales Government]] is offering a reward of $100,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.&lt;ref name="nsw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.police.nsw.gov.au/can_you_help_us/rewards/100000_reward/20060626_reward_to_solve_raymond_terrace_murder|publisher=police.nsw.gov.au|title=Murder of Margaret Gall - NSW Police Online|accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Strike Force Varberg was formed to investigate the murder. It included detectives from the [[homicide squad]] and the Port Stephens Local Area Command.&lt;ref name="dailytelegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/woman-27-charged-with-2002-murder-of-margaret-gall-after-10000-reward/news-story/713abc12120ac4e8a5fbc10d68bbac2d|publisher=dailytelegraph.com.au|title=Woman, 27, charged with 2002 murder of Margaret Gall after $100,00 reward; The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Anne Maree Wotherspoon, a 27-year-old woman from [[Hamilton South, New South Wales|Hamilton South]], was arrested in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle CBD]]. She was subsequently charged with murder and then refused bail. Eventually three other people were arrested and charged for their alleged involvement. However, in April 2012, prosecutors dropped charges against all three of the accused.&lt;ref name="maitlandmercury"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maitlandmercury.com.au/story/100613/charges-dropped-and-free-from-jail/|publisher=maitlandmercury.com.au|title=Charges dropped and free from jail &amp;#124; The Maitland Mercury|accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013, the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]] ruled that the confession of Wotherspoon was unreliable. Wotherspoon had told police that she and three others had stormed Gall's home seeking drugs and money. However, she made a number of errors in her confession including what weapon was used and the time of the murder. Justice Megan Latham found that Wotherspoon had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and drug-induced psychosis, causing delusions and hallucinations. Wotherspoon, an intravenous drug user, was recorded telling one of her boyfriends that she was going to confess with the intention of being imprisoned and being placed on a [[methadone]] program.&lt;ref name="theherald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theherald.com.au/story/1925160/errors-in-confession-in-gall-murder-case/|publisher=theherald.com.au|title=Errors in confession in Gall murder case &amp;#124; Newcastle Herald|accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kinski was born in Berlin as Nastassja Aglaia Nakszynski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3m5SrXs42YEC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=Nastassja+Aglaia+Nakszynski&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tNLvUPydMIHaswbT4IGwCA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Nastassja%20Aglaia%20Nakszynski&amp;f=false|title=The Francis Ford Coppola Encyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the daughter of renowned German actor [[Klaus Kinski]]&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, John E.

Her parents divorced in 1968. After the age of 10, Kinski rarely saw her father. Her mother struggled financially to support them.&lt;ref name="guardian1999"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,290196,00.html|title=Daddy's Girl|publisher=Guardian|date=3 July 1999|access-date=18 April 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually lived in a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] in [[Munich]].

In a 1999 interview, Kinski denied that her father had [[child sexual abuse|molested]] her as a child, but said he had abused her "in other ways."&lt;ref name="guardian1999"/&gt; In 2013, when interviewed about the allegations of sexual abuse made by her half-sister [[Pola Kinski]],&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=Patrick|title=German actor Klaus Kinski 'abused his daughter Pola'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20971857|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=10 January 2013|access-date=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roxborough&gt;{{cite news|last=Roxborough|first=Scott|title=Klaus Kinski's Daughter Claims He Sexually Abused Her|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/klaus-kinski-daughter-sexual-abuse-410213|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=9 January 2013|access-date=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; she confirmed that he tried with her, but did not succeed. She said:

{{Cquote|"He was no father. 99 percent of the time I was terrified of him. He was so unpredictable that the family lived in constant terror." When asked what she would say to him now, if she had the chance, she replied: "I would do anything to put him behind bars for life. I am glad he is no longer alive."&lt;ref name=Biss&gt;{{cite news|last=Biss|first=Malta|title=Jetzt spricht Nastassja|url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/leute/klaus-kinski/jetzt-spricht-nastassja-kinski-ueber-ihren-vater-28071840.bild.html|publisher=[[Bild]]|date=13 January 2013|access-date=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Career==
Kinski began working as a model as a teenager in [[Germany]]. Actress [[Lisa Kreuzer]] of the [[Neue Deutsche Welle|German New Wave]] helped get her the role of the mute Mignon in [[Wim Wenders]] 1975 film ''[[The Wrong Move]]'',&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11394696/Nastassja-Kinski-interview-Ive-had-such-low-self-esteem.html |title=Nastassja Kinski interview: 'I've had such low self-esteem' |last=Jenkins |first=David |date=6 February 2015 |access-date=9 June 2016 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which at the age of 12 she was depicted topless.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/reviewing-the-screen-works-of-wenders-1425259939 |title=Fresh Takes on Director Wim Wenders |last=Dollar |first=Steve |date=1 March 2015 |access-date=24 July 2016 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later played one of the leading roles in Wenders' film ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]'' (1984) and appeared in his ''[[Faraway, So Close]]'' (1993).

In 1976, while still a teenager, Kinski had her first two major roles: in [[Wolfgang Petersen]]'s [[feature film]]-length episode ''[[Reifezeugnis]]'' of the German TV crime series ''[[Tatort]].'' Next, she appeared in the British horror film ''[[To the Devil a Daughter]]'' (1976), produced by [[Hammer Film Productions]], which was released in the UK just 40 days after Kinski's fifteenth birthday, making it a virtual certainty she was only fourteen when her scenes were shot (including full frontal nudity). In regards to her early films, Kinski has stated that she felt exploited by the industry. In an interview with ''[[W (magazine)|W]]'', she said, "If I had had somebody to protect me or if I had felt more secure about myself, I would not have accepted certain things. Nudity things. And inside it was just tearing me apart."&lt;ref&gt;Nastassja Kinski interview with Louise Farr. "Kinski Business", ''[[W (magazine)|W]]'', May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Kinski starred in the Italian romance ''[[Stay As You Are]]'' (''Così come sei'') with [[Marcello Mastroianni]], gaining her recognition in the United States after [[New Line Cinema]] released it there in December 1979. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''  wrote that she was "simply ravishing, genuinely sexy and high-spirited without being painfully aggressive about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=R.S. |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952572,00.html|title=Cinema: Bedrock Taboo|work=TIME|date=21 January 1980|access-date=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film also received a major international release from [[Columbia Pictures]].

Kinski met the director [[Roman Polanski]] at a party in 1976.&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20079025,00.html|title=After 'Tess' and Roman Polanski, Nastassia Kinski trades notoriety for L.A. Propriety|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=13 April 1981|access-date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He urged her to study [[method acting]] with [[Lee Strasberg]] in the United States and she was offered the title role in Polanski's upcoming film, ''[[Tess (1979 film)|Tess]]'' (1979). In 1978, Kinski underwent extensive preparation for the portrayal of an English peasant girl, which included acquiring a [[West Country English|Dorset accent]] through elocution studies: 
{{Cquote|I was given the book almost a year prior to read, I then had to transform myself and lose my German accent completely. I worked with a coach from the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre in London]], Kate Flemming. It was almost an intellectual voyage. [...] I went to live in the countryside of the deep part of England, on a farm, did everything they did, and learned it. When the time came in Paris to do my test, it was with our director and our producers [[Claude Berri]] and Timothy Burrill, I had done a screen test with Roman prior to that, for [[Dino DeLaurentis]], but now this was for ''Tess''. Preparation is an amazing thing. It, somehow, after all the work, carries you if you are fully present, it carries you through like a bird, like big inner and outer wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/working-from-the-heart-an-interview-with-and-appreciation-of-nastassja-kinski|title=Working From The Heart: The Career Of Nastassja Kinski|publisher=[[Roger Ebert]]|date=25 November 2014|access-date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:נסטסיה.jpg|thumb|Nastassja Kinski with [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]] and Yoni S. Hamenachem on the set of ''[[Maria's Lovers]]'' (1984)]]
The film was nominated for six awards, including Best Picture, at the [[53rd Academy Awards]], and won three.

In 1981, [[Richard Avedon]] photographed Kinski with a Burmese python coiled around her nude body.&lt;ref name="Welsh, James Michael page 154" /&gt; The image, which first appeared in the October 1981 issue of [[Vogue (magazine)|US ''Vogue'']], was released as a poster and became a best-seller, further confirming her status as a sex symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savill|first1=Richard|title=Nastassja Kinski snake print to go on sale|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/artsales/5674192/Nastassja-Kinski-snake-print-to-go-on-sale.html|website=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|access-date=29 March 2015|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, she starred in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s romantic musical ''[[One from the Heart]],'' her first film made in the United States.&lt;ref name=Coppola&gt;Coppola, Francis Ford; Phillips, Gene D.; Hill, Rodney. ''Francis Ford Coppola: Interviews'', Univ. Press of Mississippi, (2004) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; ''Texas Monthly'' described her as acting "as a [[Federico Fellini|Felliniesque]] circus performer to represent the twinkling evanescence of [[Eros]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Texas Monthly'', March 1982 p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The film failed at the box office and was a major loss for Coppola's new [[Zoetrope Studios]]. That year, she was also in the erotic horror movie ''[[Cat People (1982 film)|Cat People]]''. [[Dudley Moore]]'s comedy ''[[Unfaithfully Yours (1984 film)|Unfaithfully Yours]]'' and an adaptation of [[John Irving]]'s ''[[The Hotel New Hampshire (film)|The Hotel New Hampshire]]'' followed in 1984.

Kinski reteamed with Wenders for the 1984 film ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]''. One of her most acclaimed films to date, it won the top award at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Throughout the 1980s, Kinski split her time between Europe and the United States, making ''[[Moon in the Gutter]]'' (1983), ''[[Harem (film)|Harem]]'' (1985) and ''[[Torrents of Spring (film)|Torrents of Spring]]'' (1989) in Europe, and ''[[Exposed (1983 film)|Exposed]]'' (1983), ''[[Maria's Lovers]]'' (1984) and ''[[Revolution (1985 film)|Revolution]]'' (1985) in the United States.

During the 1990s, Kinski appeared in a number of American films, including the action movie ''[[Terminal Velocity (film)|Terminal Velocity]]'' opposite [[Charlie Sheen]], the [[Mike Figgis]] 1997 adultery tale ''[[One Night Stand (1997 film)|One Night Stand]]'', ''[[Your Friends &amp; Neighbors]]'' (1998), [[John Landis]]' ''[[Susan's Plan]]'' (1998), and ''[[The Lost Son (film)|The Lost Son]]'' (1999).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:Chameria assosciation.jpg|thumb|110px|Ancient king Pyrrhus as logo of the association]]
In March 1991, the first national conference of the [[Chameria]] Political Association (CPA) was held in [[Tirana]] with many of its [[activists]] drawn from the Albanian community who had been expelled from Greece after the war. The CPA intended to bring to international attention the neglected linguistic, cultural, and educational rights of [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Cham Albanians]] who have been subjected to a Greek policy of [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. The group has also launched campaigns on behalf of Cham exiles in [[Albania]]. It has encouraged the expansion of contacts with compatriots in Greece, the return of exiles to their family areas, and the payment of compensation for property and land that was illegally taken from them during their expulsion.

==Activities==
Since 1991, Albanian activists across the political spectrum have become more outspoken on the [[Chameria]] issue vis-à-vis Greece. Historic grievances over Greek repression of [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Muslim]] [[Albanians]] earlier this century have been aired, and [[Athens]] has been criticized for its ongoing assimilationist pressures against Orthodox Albanians who still reside in the [[Chameria]], [[Epirus|Epirus region]]. Although the Greek authorities have denied that any Cham problem exists, Cham representatives have continued to urge the Albanian government to take up the issue with Athens at the highest bilateral levels.&lt;ref&gt;Janusz Bugajski, Nations in Turmoil, Westview Press, 5500 Central Ave., Boulder, p. 185-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
One particularly disingenuous endeavour by the organization leaders has been to create historical links in the public mind by presenting the ancient Greek King [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] (4th-3rd century BC) as an Albanian hero, thus revealing the extreme and [[irredentism|irredentist]] aims of the association.&lt;ref name="Grigorova"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balkans.gr/CAMS%201995.pdf |format=PDF |title=Comparative Balkan Parliamentarism |accessdate= |last=Grigorova – Mincheva |first=Lyubov |year=1995 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120014408/http://www.balkans.gr/CAMS%201995.pdf |archivedate=20 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A written petition was filed by Advocate Balkrishna Neupane at the apex court claiming that the oath was unconstitutional as it was taken in a language not recognized by the interim constitution.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; After a year long court procedure, the Supreme Court on 24 July 2009 ordered Jha to retake the oath of office and secrecy for the second time "in accordance with the Constitution," ruling that taking oath in Hindi was not constitutional.

However, Jha objected to the Supreme Court verdict, accusing the court of being biased and of conflict of interests. He stated that he would decide whether or not to retake the oath after consulting political parties and the "people he represents," i.e., the Madhesias who principally speak Maithili and Bhojpuri. He demanded changes to the law to ensure that all languages (i.e., Hindi) "are given due respect." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.zeenews.com/news550184.html | title = Is Nepal V-P on collision course with SC? | date = 25 July 2009 | work = South Asia | publisher = Zee News Limited | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090726122741/http://www.zeenews.com/news550184.html | archivedate = 26 July 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court's deadline for retaking the oath expired on 30 August 2009. As Jha did not swear once again the oath of office, the office was considered to have become vacant from 31 August 2009. In order to maintain political and ethnic inclusiveness, the Nepalese government did not seek a new Vice-President but continued to work with Jha towards a compromise, seeking to re-instate him. Changes were made to the law to allow the oath of office to be taken in native ethnic languages, e.g., Jha's native Maithili, and on 7 February 2010, he accordingly took a fresh oath of office as Vice-President in the Maithili language.&lt;ref name="nepalnews.com"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.nepalnews.com/main/index.php/news-archive/2-political/4021-jha-takes-fresh-oath-in-nepali-maithali-to-revive-vp-post.html | title = Jha takes fresh oath in Nepali &amp; Maithali to revive VP post | date = 8 February 2010| work = Nepalnews.com, news from Nepal as it happens | publisher =  Mercantile Communications Pvt.

His contemporary art ranges from [[Oil painting|oil]] on canvas to metal stainless steel sculptures and have been denoted as [[postmodernist]] by critics.&lt;ref name="petriepr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petriepr.com/rivet-the-culinary-theatre-at-rivet-at-indigo-pearl/|title=Rivet - The Culinary Theatre at Indigo Pearl &amp;bull; Petrie PR|publisher=petriepr.com|accessdate=12 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232404/http://petriepr.com/rivet-the-culinary-theatre-at-rivet-at-indigo-pearl/|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Watchmaking==
Pierre Koukjian has pioneered many advancements in the Swiss watchmaking industry. He later added to his creations various world premiere creations such as the double repeater and inlaying a tobacco leaf in the dial of a watch.&lt;ref name="frostoflondon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frostoflondon.co.uk/about-delacour-i43|title=About deLaCour|publisher=frostoflondon.co.uk|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary art==
Pierre Koukjian's work in art were born from a need to explore new materials and way of expressing oneself on an art medium. He is mostly known for his critiques of Lebanese society with his neon piece "Electricity ON, Electricity OFF". A recent polemic in the contemporary art world has put Pierre KOUKJIAN as the eye witness of the destruction of a painting during a Sotheby's auction where the artist said"a turning point in the history of contemporary and conceptual art."  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/10/06/world/europe/ap-eu-britain-bansky.html&lt;/ref&gt; The timing, nature of his work, and enthusiasm about the whole situation has led to suspicions of KOUKJIAN being in fact the original Banksy.  &lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/@stephanielord_66044/is-koukjian-banksy-drawing-the-parallels-6922e39e0b96&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and notable works==

'''Rachel Hogan''' (born 1976), is a British [[primate]] [[conservation biology|conservationist]], living and working in [[Cameroon]] in West Africa, and director of the charity [[Ape Action Africa]].

Having moved to the Mefou National Park in Cameroon temporarily in 2001, Hogan decided to stay and has been there ever since, becoming director of the charity in 2010. She is well known for her work in the rescue and rehabilitation of gorillas and chimpanzees, as well as fighting the illegal [[bush meat]] trade in West Africa.

==Biography==
Rachel Hogan was born in [[Birmingham]], [[England]] and her interest in animals started during her childhood, when she had toy gorillas instead of dolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7686038.stm|title=Gorilla fascination started young|date=24 October 2008|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanconservation.org/content/view/1140/406/ African Conservation Foundation - News]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manager at Mefou National Park ===

In 2003, Hogan was appointed manager of the National Park. During her tenure, she and her team have transformed Mefou into one of the largest, most well known primate conservation charities in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/africa/090325/cameroons-gorillas-find-sanctuary?page=0%2C0%2C0%2C0 Global Post -Cameroon's gorillas find sanctuary]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, Hogan was awarded the IFAW Animal Action Award at a ceremony at the House of Lords. The IFAW awards ceremony was hosted by patron Baroness Gale and wildlife TV presenter Shauna Lowry announced the winners.&lt;ref name="bristolzoo.org.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zandavisitor.com"/&gt;

Having attracted several celebrities and renowned wildlife photographers to visit the Mefou National Park, Hogan organised a photographic exhibition at the Djeuga Palace Hotel in Yaounde in early October 2010. It was attended by Cameroonian Government Ministers, military heads and representatives from the British, US and Israeli embassies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.443554728575.243368.58336053575|title=Ape Action Africa Photo Exhbition Launch - Facebook|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogan has also mobilized support for Ape Action Africa through events in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol247.com/2011/03/17/bristol-zoo-teams-up-with-womad-for-summer-spectacular|title=Bristol 24/7 - Bristol Zoo teams up with Womad for summer spectacular|website=bristol247.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810071119/http://www.bristol247.com/2011/03/17/bristol-zoo-teams-up-with-womad-for-summer-spectacular/|archivedate=2011-08-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Director of Ape Action Africa ===
On 22 November 2010, the longstanding director of [[Ape Action Africa]], [[Avi Sivan]], was killed in a helicopter crash between Douala and Yaounde in Cameroon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4apes.com/news/viewnews.php?id=677&amp;lang=en|title=Ape Alliance and PASA - PASA Mourns Tragic Death of Cameroon Sanctuary Director|website=4apes.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005064410/http://www.4apes.com/news/viewnews.php?id=677&amp;lang=en|archivedate=2011-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cameroon-today.com/cameroon-helicopter-crash-ex-israel-defense-forces-idf-top-officer-killed/1975/|title=CAMEROON HELICOPTER CRASH: EX- ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES (IDF) TOP OFFICER KILLED.  - Cameroon Today - Breaking News - Daily News Updates|date=22 November 2010|website=cameroon-today.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3988506,00.html|title=Ex-IDF officer killed in Cameroon crash|date=23 November 2010|website=ynetnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sivan had long been a driving force within the charity and a close ally of Hogan. Just over a month later, the board of trustees of the charity announced Rachel Hogan as the new Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whogivesamonkeys.com/2011/02/05/new-appointment-for-ape-action-africa/|title=New appointments for Ape Action Africa|date=5 February 2011|website=whogivesamonkeys.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also appointed Bibila Tafon (Babs) as the new Manager of the Mefou National Park.

One of Hogan's first moves was to bring the administrative offices of the charity back to the Mefou National Park from [[Yaounde]], to improve communications between the conservation efforts and administrative necessities of the charity.

=== Bush meat activism and education ===
Hogan has campaigned against the illegal poaching and selling of rain forest animal species for many years - and particularly the exploitation of chimpanzees and gorillas in this way.

Many of the communities living around Cameroon have hunted primates for meat for centuries, but the recent commercialization of the trade has led to a large increase in the demand for bush meat, a trend that Hogan has been fighting at many levels.

Hogan has introduced a grassroots educational program, in which local charity workers visit communities and schools to teach about bush meat.

Local employment at Ape Action Africa has also helped to spread the message, as well as benefiting the community.

In February 2010, bush meat was discovered on a market in Hogan's hometown, Birmingham and identified as chimpanzee meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/news/midlands-news/2011/02/27/chimp-meat-discovered-on-menu-in-midlands-restaurants-66331-28243001|title=Chimp meat discovered on menu in Midlands restaurants|first=Sunday|last=Mercury|date=27 February 2011|website=sundaymercury.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Gookin was the younger son of Sir [[Vincent Gookin (writer)|Vincent Gookin]] and his first wife Mary Wood.{{sfn|Dunlop|1890a|pp=154}}

Gookin served in Ireland during the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] for the Royalist cause,{{sfn|Kelsey|2004}} and the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] for the English Parliament, taking a prominent part in the defection of the [[Munster]] forces in 1648, and being actively engaged in the surrender of [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]] in the following year. In 1652, in pursuance of an agreement with the commissioners of the parliament, he fortified the abbey of [[Rosscarbery]], [[County Cork]], for which he afterwards claimed and received compensation. Under the [[Interregnum (Ireland)|Commonwealth]] he received considerable grants of forfeited land, which, in order to secure at the approach of the [[Restoration of Charles II]], he conveyed to [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery]], taking a lease of them for one hundred years. He died in late 1666 or early 1667&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlop|1890|p=155}} cites Salisbury, ''Family Memorials''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelsey|2004}} his will was proved on 20 February 1667.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Gookin married  Dorothy, who subsequently married Randal Clayton, son of Sir Randal Clayton of Thelwall, Cheshire. Gookin and Dorothy had two sons Vincent and Robert and two daughters Anne and Mary.{{sfn|Kelsey|2004}} His elder brother [[Vincent Gookin (surveyor-general)|Vincent Gookin]] (1616?-1659), was [[surveyor-general of Ireland]] during the [[Interregnum (Ireland)|Interregnum]].{{sfn|Dunlop|1890|pp=154–155}}

A former high school cheerleader, paralegal, and a mother of three, Rossmiller posed online as militant anti-American Muslim radicals to attract the eye of those with similar mindsets.&lt;ref name="seattletimes"/&gt; While still a member of 7-Seas group, she provided evidence that led to the arrest and conviction of [[Ryan G. Anderson]], a National Guardsman who was about to deploy from the U.S. to Iraq.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;Mitchel, Melanthia.[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-05-13-netsleuth_x.htm "Net sleuth tells court of hunt that snared Guardsman"], May 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shannen Rossmiller, [http://www.meforum.org/article/1711 "My Cyber Counter-jihad"], ''Middle East Quarterly'', Summer 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan is now serving a life sentence for seeking to aid the enemy during a time of war and attempted espionage.&lt;ref name="nytsanders"&gt;Sanders, Eli.

In 2005, while posing online as an Al Qaeda financier, Rossmiller offered the transient [[Michael Curtis Reynolds|Michael Reynolds]] $40,000 to purchase fuel trucks to attack American pipelines. Reynolds was arrested when he attempted to pick up the money. In 2007, he was convicted by a jury of attempting to provide material support to Al Qaeda and related charges, and sentenced to 30 years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, George.[http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7009102263 "American Convicted Of Attempting To Aid Al-Qaida Sentenced To 30 Years"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209001011/http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7009102263 |date=2007-12-09 }}, "AllHeadlineNews.com",November 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Skjöldr''' (Latinized as '''Skioldus''', sometimes Anglicized as '''Skjold''' or '''Skiold''') was among the first [[List of legendary kings of Denmark|legendary Danish kings]]. He is mentioned in the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', in ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'', in ''[[Chronicon Lethrense]]'', in [[Sven Aggesen]]'s history, in [[Arngrímur Jónsson]]'s Latin abstract of the lost ''[[Skjöldunga saga]]'' and in [[Saxo Grammaticus]]' ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Under the name '''Scyld''' he also appears in the [[Old English]] poem ''[[Beowulf]]''. The various accounts have little in common.

In the ''Skjöldunga saga'' and the ''Ynglinga saga'', [[Odin]] came from Asia (Scythia) and conquered Northern Europe. He gave Sweden to his son Yngvi and Denmark to his son Skjöldr. Since then the kings of [[Sweden]] were called [[Yngling]]s and those of [[Denmark]] Skjöldungs.

'''Scyld Scefing''' is the legendary ancestor of the Danish royal lineage known as the [[Scylding]]s. He is the counterpart of the ''Skioldus'' or ''Skjöldr'' of Danish and Icelandic sources.

He appears in the opening lines of ''[[Beowulf]]'', where he is referred to as ''Scyld Scefing'', indicating he is a descendant of [[Sceafa]], Scyld son of Scef, or Scyld of the Sheaf. The ''Beowulf'' poet places him in a boat which is seen in other stories about Scef as a child in a boat.  After relating in general terms the glories of Scyld's reign, the poet describes Scyld's funeral, his body was laid in a ship surrounded by treasures:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;They decked his body no less bountifully&lt;br&gt;
with offerings than those first ones did&lt;br&gt;
who cast him away when he was a child&lt;br&gt;
and launched him alone out over the waves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William of Malmesbury]]'s 12th century ''Chronicle'' tells the story of [[Sceafa]] as a sleeping child in a boat without oars with a sheaf of corn at his head.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gale Owen-Crocker|Owen-Crocker, Gale R.]], ''The Four Funerals in "Beowulf"''. Manchester University Press: Manchester, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Axel Olrik]] in 1910 suggested a parallel "barley-figure" in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] [[Peko]], in turn connected by Fulk (1989) with Eddaic [[Bergelmir]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulk, R. D. "An Eddic Analogue to the Scyld Scefing Story", ''The Review of English Studies'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gesta Danorum==
In ''Gesta Danorum'', Skioldus is the son of [[Lotherus]], a wicked king who met his end in an insurrection.

Cuius filius Skyoldus naturam ab ipso, non mores sortitus per summam tenerioris aetatis industriam cuncta paternae contagionis vestigia ingeniti erroris devio praeteribat. Igitur ut a paternis vitiis prudenter descivit, ita avitis virtutibus feliciter respondit, remotiorem pariter ac praestantiorem hereditarii moris portionem amplexus. Huius adolescentia inter paternos venatores immanis beluae subactione insignis exstitit mirandoque rei eventu futurae eius fortitudinis habitum ominata est. Nam cum a tutoribus forte, quorum summo studio educabatur, inspectandae venationis licentiam impetrasset, obvium sibi insolitae granditatis ursum telo vacuus cingulo, cuius usum habebat, religandum curavit necandumque comitibus praebuit. Sed et complures spectatae fortitudinis pugiles per idem tempus viritim ab eo superati produntur, e quibus Attalus et Scatus clari illustresque fuere. Quindecim annos natus inusitato corporis incremento perfectissimum humani roboris specimen praeferebat, tantaque indolis eius experimenta fuere, ut ab ipso ceteri Danorum reges communi quodam vocabulo Skioldungi nuncuparentur. Praecurrebat igitur Skioldus virium complementum animi maturitate conflictusque gessit, quorum vix spectator ob teneritudinem esse poterat.

Hic non armis modo, verum etiam patriae caritate conspicuus exstitit: siquidem impias leges abrogavit, salutares tulit, et quicquid ad emendandum patriae statum attinuit, summa diligentia praestitit. Sed et regnum patris improbitate amissum virtute recuperavit. Primus rescindendarum manumissionum legem edidit, servi, quem forte libertate donaverat, clandestinis insidiis petitus. Proceres non solum domesticis stipendiis colebat, sed etiam spoliis ex hoste quaesitis, affirmare solitus pecuniam ad milites, gloriam ad ducem redundare debere. Omnium aes alienum ex fisco suo solvebat et quasi cum aliorum regum fortitudine, munificentia ac liberalitate certabat. Aegros fomentis prosequi remediaque graviter affectis benignius exhibere solebat, se non sui sed patriae curam suscepisse testatus. Idem perditam et enervam vitam agentes continentiamque luxu labefacere solitos ad capessendam virtutem rerum agitatione sedulus excitabat.

In quo annorum virtutisque procursu ob Alvildam Saxonum regis filiam, quam summae pulchritudinis intuitu postulabat, cum Scato, Allemanniae satrapa, eiusdem puellae competitore, Theutonum Danorumque exercitu inspectante ex provocatione dimicavit interfectoque eo omnem Allemannorum gentem perinde ac ducis sui interitu debellatam tributaria ditione perdomuit.

Puellam, cuius amore conflixerat, acerrimo nuptiarum aemulo liberatus in pugnae praemium recepit eamque sibi matrimonio copulavit. Ex qua parvo post tempore Gram filium sustulit. Cuius mirifica indoles ita paternas virtutes redoluit, ut prorsus per earum vestigia decurrere putaretur.

SKIOLD, his son, inherited his natural bent, but not his behaviour; avoiding his inborn perversity by great discretion in his tender years, and thus escaping all traces of his father's taint. So he appropriated what was alike the more excellent and the earlier share of the family character; for he wisely departed from his father's sins, and became a happy counterpart of his grandsire's virtues. This man was famous in his youth among the huntsmen of his father for his conquest of a monstrous beast: a marvellous incident, which augured his future prowess. For he chanced to obtain leave from his guardians, who were rearing him very carefully, to go and see the hunting. A bear of extraordinary size met him; he had no spear, but with the girdle that he commonly wore he contrived to bind it, and gave it to his escort to kill. More than this, many champions of tried prowess were at the same time of his life vanquished by him singly; of these Attal and Skat were renowned and famous. While but fifteen years of age he was of unusual bodily size and displayed mortal strength in its perfection, and so mighty were the proofs of his powers that the rest of the kings of the Danes were called after him by a common title, the [[Scylding|SKIOLDUNGS]]. Those who were wont to live an abandoned and flaccid life, and to sap their selfcontrol by wantonness, this man vigilantly spurred to the practice of virtue in an active career. Thus the ripeness of Skiold's spirit outstripped the fulness of his strength, and he fought battles at which one of his tender years could scarce look on. 
[[File:Skjold binder Bjørnen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Skjöldr ties up the bear, illustration by [[Louis Moe]]]]
Skiold was eminent for patriotism as well as arms. For he annulled unrighteous laws, and most heedfully executed whatsoever made for the amendment of his country's condition. Further, he regained by his virtue the realm that his father's wickedness had lost. He was the first to proclaim the law abolishing manumissions. A slave, to whom he had chanced to grant his freedom, had attempted his life by stealthy treachery, and he exacted a bitter penalty; as though it were just that the guilt of one freedman should be visited upon all. He paid off all men's debts from his own treasury, and contended, so to say, with all other monarchs in courage, bounty, and generous dealing. The sick he used to foster, and charitably gave medicines to those sore stricken; bearing witness that he had taken on him the care of his country and not of himself. He used to enrich his nobles not only with home taxes, but also with plunder taken in war; being wont to aver that the prize-money should flow to the soldiers, and the glory to the general.

And as he thus waxed in years and valour he beheld the perfect beauty of Alfhild, daughter of the King of the [[Saxons]], sued for her hand, and, for her sake, in the sight of the armies of the Teutons and the Danes, challenged and fought with Skat, governor of [[Alamannia|Allemannia]], and a suitor for the same maiden; whom he slew, afterwards crushing the whole nation of the Allemannians, and forcing them to pay tribute, they being subjugated by the death of their captain.

Thus delivered of his bitterest rival in wooing, he took as the prize of combat the maiden, for the love of whom he had fought, and wedded her in marriage. Soon after, he had by her a son, [[Gram of Denmark|GRAM]], whose wondrous parts savoured so strongly of his father's virtues that he was deemed to tread in their very footsteps.

'''Spiral Tribe''', now known as '''SP23''', are a musical and arts collective and former [[free party]] [[Sound system (DJ)|sound system]], originating from [[West London (sub-region)|West London]] and heavily active throughout the [[UK]] and [[Europe]] during the 1990s organising parties, festivals and raves.&lt;ref name="sp23"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sp23.org/|title= About - sp23infoblip |website=Sp23.org|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are best known for their involvement in the infamous [[Castlemorton Common Festival]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/12/90s-spiral-tribe-free-parties|title=Fight for the right to party |author= Tim Guest|date=11 July 2009|website=The Guardian |accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early History==

Between 1990 and 1992, Spiral Tribe were responsible for numerous parties, raves, and festivals in indoor and outdoor locations in the [[UK]].&lt;ref name="select"&gt;{{cite magazine| title= Earthcore: The Chaotic Rise of Spiral Tribe| author= Shaw, William | magazine= Select Magazine: August 1992 | pages=24–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, the group travelled across Europe and had a huge influence on the emerging [[free tekno]] scene. Whilst doing so, members of the collective have released seminal records on both their own label [[Network 23 (record label)|Network 23]] as well as enjoying a brief spell of crossover success on the mainstream Big Life label.

On New Year's Eve 1991, a rave was held at the then empty [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] venue in Camden, London, which was to last for a week.&lt;ref name="roundhouse"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://50.roundhouse.org.uk/content-items/like-something-mad-max-spiral-tribes-week-long-rave | title= It was like something out of Mad Max: Spiral Tribe's Week Long Rave | author= Leanne Griffin | work=Roundhouse 50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1992, what would become the most well known and largest party the group had involvement in, also proved to be the most controversial. The [[Castlemorton Common Festival]] would turn out to be an unintended consequence of Police preventing travellers heading for the annual Avon Free Festival.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Thirteen members of Spiral Tribe were arrested immediately after the Castlemorton event and subsequently charged with public order offences.&lt;ref name="reynolds"&gt;Reynolds S, 1998, ''Energy Flash'', Picador, {{ISBN|0-5712-8914-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their trial became one of the longest-running and most expensive cases in British legal history, lasting four months and costing the UK £4 million.&lt;ref&gt;Brewster B. &amp; Broughton F., 1999, ''Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey'', Grove Press, {{ISBN|0-8021-3688-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiral Tribe first use the slogan "Make some fucking noise" on T-shirts which they wore in the court room. The judge ordered them to remove these garments. However, when the female defendants revealed that they wore nothing underneath their T-shirts, the judge reversed his instructions, something quite rare in UK courts.&lt;ref name="msfn"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Skeet|first1=Jason|title=&lt;makesomefuckingnoise&gt;|url=https://www.academia.edu/31771032/_makesomefuckingnoise_| website=www.academia.edu|publisher=Academia|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Castlemorton, Nigel South states that "the adverse publicity attending the event laid the groundwork for the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice Act 1994]]".&lt;ref&gt;ed. South N., 1999, ''Drugs: Cultures, Controls and Everyday Life'', SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|0-7619-5235-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Low and Barnett opine in ''Spaces of Democracy'' that "Spiral Tribe, with their free and inclusive parties, succeeded in constituting an alternative public space, rather than just a secret one.".&lt;ref&gt;ed. Low M. and Barnett C., 2004, ''Spaces of Democracy: Geographical Perspectives on Citizenship, Participation and Representation'', SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|0-7619-4734-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being acquitted of all charges relating to Castlemorton in March 1993, the group moved to [[Europe]] shortly after, doing parties in cities such as Rotterdam, Paris, and Berlin. Over the next few years, the collective organised parties and [[teknival]]s throughout Europe, then it slowly dispersed with some members taking up residence in Germany and the Netherlands and releasing work on Labworks and many other techno labels. Individual members of the collective joined other sound systems, did squat art events or pursued other interests.

Spiral Tribe also toured the [[United States]] and hosted a party in [[Goa]] towards the late 90s.

According to Spiral Tribe founding member Mark Stormcore, the name came to him when he was at work, staring at a poster of the interconnecting spirals in an [[ammonite]] shell.&lt;ref name="uncivil"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126135938/http://www.uncivilizedworld.com/WTA_en.php3 | title=Uncivilized World - World Traveller Adventures| website=uncivilizedworld.com| accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number 23, which is ubiquitously associated with Spiral Tribe, originates from the book ''The Cosmic Trigger'' by Robert Anton Wilson.&lt;ref name="datacide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://datacide-magazine.com/spiral-tribe-interview | title=Spiral Tribe Interview| website= Datacide| date=24 March 2014 |accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, several of the original members of Spiral Tribe reformed as ''SP23'', a creative collective involved in a number of grassroots and community projects as well as still hosting legal parties.&lt;ref name="sp23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dmc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcworld.net/features/sp23/|title=SP23|work=DMC World Magazine|author=Dan Prince}}&lt;/ref&gt; A return party was held in London's Shoreditch in April 2013 at the ''Village Underground'' club.&lt;ref name="histnight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-is-made-at-night.blogspot.com/2013/03/sp23-formerly-spiral-tribe-back-in.html | title=SP23 (formerly Spiral Tribe) back in London |work=History Is Made at Night|date=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, SP23 have hosted nights in London, Rotterdam, Berlin, Paris, and Milan amongst many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sp23.org/events/ |title= Events - sp23infoblip| website=Sp23.org | accessdate= 13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The four founding members of Spiral Tribe/SP23 are Mark, Debbie, Mickey and Simone. As the notion of being a member of the collective has always been a largely informal one, it has regularly changed throughout time and place.

===Current SP23 Members===

==Music==
In 1992, some members of the collective signed to the major label Big Life, as a result of the publicity generated from their involvement in the organisation of the Castlemorton Common Festival. Three EPs were released with them enjoying short crossover success with ''Forward The Revolution'' and ''Breach The Peace'', an album ''Tekno Terra'', as well as a compilation.

Members of Spiral Tribe also released records on their own label [[Network 23 (record label)|Network 23]], as well as Rabbit City, Music Inc, and LabWorks.

In 1997, Techno Import, a French commercial distributor, compiled a CD entitled ''Spiral Tribe: The Sound of Teknival''. The CD consisted of previously licensed material via Big Life, Rabbit City, and Force Inc. It was released without any consent from members of Spiral Tribe, was advertised on television and sold at least 30,000 copies. Spiral Tribe issued a statement against its release which began, "F**k Techno Import, Spiral Tribe Is Not For Sale", and had to take quick action to ensure the name Spiral Tribe was not copyrighted by Techno Import.

'''Théodore Sindikubwabo''' (1928&amp;ndash;1998) was the interim [[President of Rwanda]] during the [[Rwandan genocide]], from April 9 to July 19, 1994. Prior to that he was President of the National Development Council ([[Parliament of Rwanda]]) 1988&amp;ndash;1994. 

Born in the town of [[Butare]] in the south of Rwanda, Sindikubwabo was educated as a physician, and was Minister of Health in the administration of President [[Gregoire Kayibanda|Kayibanda]].  Following the takeover by [[Juvénal Habyarimana]], Sindikubwabo became a practising pediatrician in Kigali Central Hospital.  He later returned to politics as a deputy in parliament.

Immediately following Habyarimana's assassination on April 6, 1994, Sindikubwabo was installed as interim President by the Crisis Committee controlled by Colonel [[Théoneste Bagosora]], and he was the head of state during the genocide. Sindikubwabo is widely believed to have been a puppet of the group of military officers who held the real power.  On 19 April 1994, he made a now infamous speech at the ceremony appointing a new ''Préfet'' (Governor) of Butare that was broadcast on national radio, in which he insulted those who were not "working", a euphemism for killing [[Tutsi]]s, and told them to "get out of the way and let us work".  On 29 April, he returned to Butare and told the populace that he was there to supervise the killing of Tutsi.  On an 18 May visit to [[Kibuye, Rwanda|Kibuye]] Prefecture, he congratulated the people on how well they had done their "work". {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} 

Following the invasion of the [[Rwandese Patriotic Front]] that took control of the country and ended the genocide, Sindikubwabo fled to [[Zaire]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), where he lived in exile in [[Bukavu]].  He was interviewed there for the book ''[[We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families]]'' and quoted as saying: "The moment has not yet come to say who is guilty and who is not guilty."  He was initially reported to have been killed in the Rwandan government attack on Bukavu in November 1996 at the beginning of the [[First Congo War]], but subsequent reports put him in [[Kinshasa]].  He died in exile in Democratic Republic of the Congo in  the late 1990s of natural causes and was never charged by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]].

[[File:William Macarthur.png|thumb|Sir William Macarthur]]

The Honourable '''Sir William Macarthur''' (December 1800 – 29 October 1882) was an Australian [[botanist]] and [[Winemaker#Vigneron|vigneron]]. He was one of the most active and influential horticulturists in Australia in the mid-to-late 19th century. Among the first viticulturists in Australia, Macarthur was a medal-winning wine-maker, as well as a respected amateur botanist and noted plant breeder.

== Biography ==

William Macarthur was born at [[Parramatta]] in December 1800, the fifth son of [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John]] and [[Elizabeth Macarthur]], pioneers of the Australian wool industry. He was educated in England at [[Rugby School]], returned to Australia with his father in 1817, and assisted in the management of his estates. These estates included land controlled by the Macarthurs south along the [[Murrumbidgee River]] from [[Gundagai, New South Wales|Gundagai]].  Brothers James&lt;ref name=James&gt;J. D. Heydon, [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020132b.htm 'Macarthur, James (1798 - 1867)'], Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 2, Melbourne University Press, 1967, pp 149-153.&lt;/ref&gt; and William Macarthur stocked 'Nangus Station' with cattle in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;Butcher, C. 2002 ''Gundagai: A Track Winding Back'', Cliff Butcher, self-published, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The island in the middle of the River at Nangus is marked as one of the early goldfields and named "M'Arthur Island". The island is where the highly auriferous Adelong Creek enters the [[Murrumbidgee River]].&lt;ref&gt;Victoria [map] Bartholomew, John, 1805-1860. 1853 Victoria Historical MAPS MX 820 a 1853 Available [online] http://db.lib.unimelb.edu.au/mrsid-cgi/map_view.cgi&lt;/ref&gt; William pursued a slight career in colonial politics, though this was secondary to his interests in botany. William lived at [[Camden Park, New South Wales|Camden Park]], south west of Sydney, with his brother James&lt;ref name=James/&gt; who was prominent in local and colonial politics.

== Contribution to horticulture ==

[[File:Culture of the Vine.png|thumb|Title page of ''Letters on the culture of the vine, fermentation, and the management of wine in the cellar'', 1844 by "Maro" — the pseudonym for William Macarthur.]]

In 1844, William Macarthur, regarded at the time as a leading Australian [[Viticulture|viticulturist]], published a small volume, ''Letters on the Culture of the Vine, Fermentation, and the Management of the Cellar'', which was widely read.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Walsh (1979):[http://www.megalong.cc/FamilyHistory/TheWineIndustryofAustralia1788-1979.htm The Wine Industry of Australia 1788 1979] Accessed 25 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He was President of New South Wales Vineyard Association and had a vineyard and extensive cellars at the family estate at [[Camden Park, New South Wales|Camden Park]].&lt;ref name=NSWparl/&gt;

[[File:Erythrina x bidwillii 'Camdeni'.png|thumb|''[[Erythrina ×bidwillii]]'' 'Camdeni' — bred by William Macarthur, was the first Australian [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] garden plant to be published in England, in 1847.]]

Macarthur was a competent [[botanist]], [[horticulturist]] and [[agriculturist]], and his operations helped to make Camden Park celebrated. He entertained eminent scientific men who visited the Colony and bore the reputation of a cultured gentleman. He sent plants to [[James Backhouse]] which are now in the Herbarium at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] and the [[British Museum]]. The extensive catalogues of his Camden Park Nursery, published in 1843, 1845, 1850 and 1857, provide a valuable insight both into the contents of colonial gardens and to the international exchange of plants in the early-to-mid-19th century. 'Aspasia macarthur', bred at Camden Park, was the first Australian cultivar of the camellia.

Macarthur is commemorated in the genus ''[[Macarthuria]]'' &lt;small&gt;[[Charles von Hügel|Hugel]] ex [[Endl.]]&lt;/small&gt;, also in the species: ''[[Cyathea macarthurii]]'' &lt;small&gt;[[F.Muell.]]&lt;/small&gt; and ''[[Ptychosperma macarthurii]]''

== Political life ==

In 1849 he was elected a member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] for the [[Electoral district of Port Phillip]].&lt;ref name=NSWparl&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macarthur represented [[New South Wales]] at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Paris International Exhibition of 1855]], where his fluency in French was invaluable in resolving initial confusion over the areas allotted to the Australian colonies. A selection of Australian timber specimens from the Exposition are displayed at [[Camden Park, New South Wales|Camden Park]]. Shortly afterwards he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]]. After his return to Australia in 1857, he was appointed a member of the Legislative Council, but he never took a prominent part in politics and was more at home with his pastoral pursuits, having been given stewardship of his family's landmark pastoral property [[Camden Park Estate, New South Wales|Camden Park]]. He was also an active in club life and served as the president of the [[Australian Club]].

He died unmarried on 29 October 1882.  His estate, along with those of his brothers [[James Macarthur (Australian politician)|James]]&lt;ref name=James/&gt; and Sir [[Edward Macarthur|Edward]], was left to his niece, James' daughter Elizabeth, wife of [[Arthur Alexander Walton Onslow]].&lt;ref&gt;Bede Nairn, [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050423b.htm 'Onslow, Arthur Alexander Walton (1833 - 1882)'], ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', Volume 5, Melbourne University Press, 1974, pp 369-370.&lt;/ref&gt; After Arthur's death, Elizabeth changed her name to Macarthur-Onslow.
