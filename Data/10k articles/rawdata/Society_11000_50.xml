      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19109">The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] defines '''aging in place''' as "the ability to live in one's own home and community safely, independently, and comfortably, regardless of age, income, or ability level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Places Terminology|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces/terminology.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental gerontology ==
Research in environmental [[gerontology]] indicates the importance of the physical and social environment of [[housing]] and the [[neighborhood]] (public space), as well as its implications for aging in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sánchez-González, Diego |author2=Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Vicente|title=Environmental Gerontology in Europe and Latin America. Policies and perspectives on environment and aging|year=2016|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=978-3-319-21418-4|page=284|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rowles, Graham D. |author2=Bernard, Miriam|title=Environmental Gerontology: Making Meaningful Places in Old Age|year=2013|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0826108135|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scheidt, Rick J. |author2=Schwarz, Benyamin|title=Environmental Gerontology. What Now?|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-62616-3|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preference ==

Most adults would prefer to age in place—that is, remain in their home of choice as long as possible. In fact, 90 percent of adults over the age of 65 report that they would prefer to stay in their current residence as they [[Ageing|age]].&lt;ref name="A Report to the National Livable Communities: Creating Environments for Successful Aging"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/il/beyond_50_communities.pdf |title=A Report to the National Livable Communities: Creating Environments for Successful Aging |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; One-third of American households are home to one or more residents 60 years of age or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cronin, Anne |author2=Marybeth Mandich|title=Human Development and Performance Throughout the Lifespan|year=2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1133951193|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Technology]] can be an enabler for aging in place—there are four categories of technology that acts as an enabler—Communication and Engagement, Health and Wellness, Learning and Contribution, and Safety and Security.&lt;ref&gt;See Market Overview for Technology for Aging in Place 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caregiving]] technologies help those who care for older adults provide that care in the most effective way—and include new technologies for [[Smartphone|smart phones]] and [[Tablet_computer|tablets]], as well as [[Website|websites]]—such as Caring.com or AARP.org/Caregiving.

== Home modifications ==

There exist many risks for injury to older adults in the common household, therefore impacting upon their capability to successfully age in place. Among the greatest threats to an ability to age in place is falling. According to the CDC, falls are the leading cause of injurious death among older adults. Therefore, engagement in fall prevention is crucial to one's ability to age in place. Common features in an everyday household, such as a lack of support in the shower or bathroom, inadequate railings on the stairs, loose throw rugs, and obstructed pathways are all possible dangers to an older person. However, simple and low-cost modifications to an older person's home can greatly decrease the risk of falling, as well as decreasing the risk of other forms of injury. Consequently, this increases the likelihood that one can age in place.&lt;ref name="Aging in Place at Home: The Definitive Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thehelpinghome.com/aging-in-place-at-home-definitive-guide-part1/ |title=Aging in Place at Home: The Definitive Guide |accessdate=2017-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of home modifications include: increased lighting, accessible switches at both ends of the stairs, additional railings, grab bars, nonskid flooring, a hand-held flexible shower head, walk-in bathtubs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therapytubs.com|title=Premier Walk In Tubs from TherapyTubs.com|website=www.therapytubs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the removal of throw rugs and clutter.&lt;ref name="Aging in Place at Home: The Definitive Guide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The National Resource Center on Supportive Housing and Home Modification"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.homemods.org/directory/nrcshhm/index.htm |title=The National Resource Center on Supportive Housing and Home Modification |publisher=Usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, home modifications can be simple and cost-effective, while simultaneously offering substantial benefits to the individual. Other modifications to the home – especially those that require retrofitting – are a little more costly due to increased complexity of installation. These can include: ramps for accessible entry and exit, walk-in shower, sliding shelves, stairlifts, or even home elevators. Many homes are built or retrofitted with the [[Universal design]] model in mind, which makes everything in the home accessible to all people with or without functional limitations.&lt;ref name="The National Resource Center on Supportive Housing and Home Modification" /&gt;

==Resources in the community==
Naturally occurring retirement communities, also known as NORCS, are another source of support for older adults wishing to age in place.  A NORC, though not built specifically for a certain age demographic, occurs where a congregation of residents 60 and older live cooperatively.  Some offer recreational activities, preventative health and social services for the community.  This model can be supported by local, state, and federal dollars as well as community businesses, neighborhood associations and private foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NORC|url=http://www.philanthropicgroup.com/giaaip050409v2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological changes==
In some cases, the [[caregivers]] of people who are aging in place seek to persuade them to adopt new technology, which may include learning new skills and changing their daily routine to incorporate the technology.&lt;ref name="Peek 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peek|first1=Sebastiaan T.M.|last2=Wouters|first2=Eveline J.M.|last3=van Hoof|first3=Joost|last4=Luijkx|first4=Katrien G.|last5=Boeije|first5=Hennie R.|last6=Vrijhoef|first6=Hubertus J.M.|title=Factors influencing acceptance of technology for aging in place: A systematic review|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|date=April 2014|volume=83|issue=4|pages=235–248|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2014}}, there is research about how people aging in place try to use new technology when persuaded, but not much research about the extent to which they continue to use it after trying it for some time.&lt;ref name="Peek 2014"/&gt; Factors which contribute to the decision to try to technology are the anticipated benefits of the technology, the difficulty using it, the extent to which the user feels that harm will come from not using it, the availability of alternatives, support from others in their social circle, and their own personal attitudes and disposition.&lt;ref name="Peek 2014"/&gt;

==Biological reasons==
Many elders have difficulties with everyday functioning that require modifications to the houses or apartments they live in. There are several reasons why these changes happen:
*Motor functioning: In a 2002 study by Min Soo Kang, it was reported that of the elder population in America, 18% will have a disability. This calculates to 51 million Americans who have difficulties in functioning every day. 32% over age 65 will have difficulty walking, which may require use of walkers, wheelchairs and canes. To make life easier for the elder, some modifications that can aid them are wider entrances, grab rails, elevator chairs on stairs, etc.
*Fine motor functioning: Elders may have difficulty using their fingers, which can be problematic. As a result, modifications to handles, bathroom fixtures, etc. can aid with this problem.
*Cognitive functioning: It was reported in Kochera (2002) that 1 out of 5 people over the age of 55 will have a mental health disorder.  Due to the deterioration, the five senses and cognitive capability decrease and cause slower responses.  As a result, fire hazards may not be noticed, which can be very important when setting up fire alarms, exits, etc.

==Examples==
Aging in place can be further defined by:

# Aging in place without urgent needs: This group includes individuals who want to stay in their current home, are not experiencing immediate health/mobility issues, and prefer aging in place.
# Aging in place with progressive condition-based needs: This group is made up of those with chronic or progressive conditions that will require special modifications for aging in place. These individuals are usually aware of their needs but meeting them is not necessarily urgent. Many have chronic conditions such as diabetes and lung/heart disease that challenge them.
# Aging in place with traumatic change needs: This group includes those who experienced an abrupt or immediate change that demands adjustments in the living environment for aging in place such as home modifications or universal design.

==Careers in the field==
By working with a person's regular [[physician]] and other doctors, an [[Occupational therapist|Occupational Therapist]] (OT) can suggest changes to be made to a person's home in order to uniquely compensate for that particular patient's capabilities and disabilities.&lt;ref name="Occupational Therapy: Helping America Age in Place"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aota.org/News/Centennial/40313/Aging/Aging-in-Place.aspx |title=Occupational Therapy: Helping America Age in Place |format=website |date= |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making an appointment and meeting with an Occupational Therapist, a patient is getting a one-on-one based session where the therapist is focused solely on that patient's limitations and is making strategies in order to modify the patient's home, making it safer and letting them keep their independence. OT's will work with contractors and occasionally local groups and volunteers to make home modifications ranging from small changes like better lighting to more extreme changes such as chair lifts instead of stairs. An OT will typically try to make low-cost adjustments in the initial stages, but once again this is based on each individual.&lt;ref name="REMAINING IN YOUR HOME AS YOU AGE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aota.org/-/media/corporate/files/aboutot/consumers/adults/aginginplace/remaining-in-place-aging.pdf |title=REMAINING IN YOUR HOME AS YOU AGE |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; OT's also provide services to older adults in community based scenarios focusing in health promotion.

== Initiatives worldwide ==

=== In Canada ===
In Ontario, Canada, aging in place is known as aging at home, and has received considerable financial support from the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care.

=== In United States ===
According to the [[United States Census]], 46 million people age 65+ lived in the United States in 2014 and this same segment of the population will grow to 74 million in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Older Americans 2016: Key Indicators of Well-Being|url=https://agingstats.gov/docs/LatestReport/Older-Americans-2016-Key-Indicators-of-WellBeing.pdf |date=2017-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Websites and organizations have sprung up all across the nation, in individual communities, states and nationwide to help people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. Aging in Place is an initiative of Partners for Livable Communities and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging. It was developed to help America's communities prepare for the aging of their population and to become places that are good to grow up, live in and grow old. They have been working directly with nine laboratory communities to assist them in advancing policies, programs and services to promote Aging in Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=e Communities for All Ages Partners for Livable Communities|title=Aging in Place Initiative|url=http://livable.org/program-areas/livable-communities-for-all-ages-a-aging-in-place/the-aging-in-place-initiative|accessdate=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar network is the [[Elder Village]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/ppi/liv-com/fs177-village.pdf The Village: A Growing Option for Aging in Place], Fact Sheet 177, AARP Public Policy Institute, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart homes are also another development to help promote aging in place by integrating a range of monitoring and supportive devices. These homes have technology for physiological monitoring, functional monitoring for emergency detection and response, safety monitoring and assistance, security monitoring and assistance, social interaction monitoring and assistance and cognitive and sensory assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icaa.cc/wef/Global-Population-Ageing-Book.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122065922/http://www.icaa.cc/wef/Global-Population-Ageing-Book.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia Institute of Technology has developed a smart house. This house would help to address issues older adults face when living alone, such as physical and mental decline as well as awareness for family members. The house includes technology such as pendants which understand commands in the form of hand gestures. It could open and lock doors, close blinds, turn on lights, and more. There is also an in-home monitoring system that can inform family members about an older relative's daily activities, health status, and potential problems. This would allow older adults to remain in their own home while still maintaining their independence without their families having to worry about their well being. This is not the only smart house that has popped up.
The University of Florida has created one as well. It has smart refrigerators and pantries which can detect food consumption and expired products. Their smart laundry machines can coordinate with the smart closet to notify the resident when it is time to do laundry as well as aid in sorting the laundry. Every room is specially designed with these and many more smart features to aid their living situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Mynatt ED, Melenhorst AS, Fisk AD, Roger WA |title=Aware Technologies for Aging in Place:  Understanding User Needs and Attitudes|url=http://www.socs.uoguelph.ca/~qmahmoud/teaching/fall2006/pervasive/aging.pdf|work=Georgia Institute of Technology|publisher=PERVASIVE computing|accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar technology has been done at the Washington State University, University of Texas, University of Massachusetts, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Missouri, as well as in Osaka, Japan.

In December 2011,  AARP Policy Institute and the National Conference of State Legislatures released a report entitled, "Aging in Place:  A State Survey of Livability Policies and Practices"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promoting Aging in place: Policies and Practices that work|url=http://www.aarp.org/home-garden/livable-communities/info-11-2011/solutions-forum-aging-in-place.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; to foster aging in place by giving state legislators examples of how laws, policies and programs can support this goal.  In addition to such governmental initiatives, livability can be optimized through the incorporation of universal design principles, telecare and other assistive technologies. Assistive technologies include communications, health and wellness monitoring, home safety and security.  Semico Research published a report in July 2013 claiming the health and wellness monitoring market for Aging in Place will reach $30 billion by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://semico.com/content/aging-place-internet-things-golden-years|title=Aging in Place:  The Internet of Things for the Golden Years - Semico Research|website=semico.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly]] (PACE) model was created in the early 1970s in order to meet the chronic care needs of older people through their community. As an assistance program, one must be at least 55 years of age, certified by their state to need nursing home care, are able to live safely in the community at the time of enrollment, and live in a PACE service area. The goal of the PACE program is to care for the chronic care needs of older individuals while providing them with the ability to live independently, or age in place in their homes, for as long as possible. In order to make independent living possible for this population, the PACE program provides services, such as physical therapy, respite care, prescription drugs, social services, nutritional counseling, and much more. Since 2011, PACE has 82 operational programs in 29 states, and is continuing to expand today.&lt;ref name="National PACE Association"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npaonline.org/website/article.asp?id=12 |title=National PACE Association |publisher=Npaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Middle Eastern and Asian countries ===
For many countries in the Middle and Far East, it is part of the cultural beliefs for older adults to age in place. Many children believe it to be their duty to care for their parents as they age and therefore will move in with their parents when their assistance is needed. In many Middle Eastern countries, nursing homes are just recently coming into existence due to cultural and generational shifts towards Western values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hegland|first=Mary Elaine|title=The Cultural Context of Aging: Worldwide Perspectives|year=2009|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport CT|isbn=978-0-275-99288-0|pages=303–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anarcho-punk''' (or '''anarchist punk''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/style/anarchist-punk-ma0000011967 Anarchist Punk | Music Highlights | AllMusic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is [[punk rock]] that promotes [[anarchism]]. The term "anarcho-punk" is sometimes applied exclusively to bands that were part of the original anarcho-punk movement in the [[United Kingdom]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some use the term more broadly to refer to any punk music with anarchist lyrical content, which may figure in [[crust punk]], [[hardcore punk]], [[folk punk]], and other styles.

==History==
[[Image:Crass pete steve andy.png|300px|thumb|[[Crass]], shown here in 1984, played a major role in introducing anarchism to the punk subculture.]]

===Before  1977===
Some [[protopunk]] bands of the late 1960s had anarchist members, such as the German blues rock band [[Ton Steine Scherben]] and English bands connected to the [[UK underground]], such as [[Hawkwind]], [[Pink Fairies]], [[The Deviants (band)|The Deviants]] and the [[Edgar Broughton Band]]. These bands, along with Detroit's [[MC5]], set a precedent for mixing radical politics with rock music, and established the idea of rock as agent of social and political change in the public consciousness. Other precursors to anarcho-punk include avant-garde art and political movements such as [[Fluxus]], [[Dada]], the [[Beat generation]], England's [[angry young men]] (such as [[Joe Orton]]), the [[surrealism]]-inspired [[Situationist International]], the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] uprising in Paris, and the [[CND]]. [[Jello Biafra]] of the [[Dead Kennedys]] has cited the [[Youth International Party|Yippies]] as an influence on his activism and thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Vander Molen, Jodi, [http://www.progressive.org/mag_intvbiafra Jello Biafra Interview], ''[[The Progressive]]'' (Feb. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colurso, Mary (2007-06-29) [http://blog.al.com/mcolurso/2007/06/jello_biafra_can_ruffle_feathe.html Jello Biafra can ruffle feathers], ''[[The Birmingham News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post 1977===
A surge of popular interest in [[anarchism]] occurred during the 1970s in the [[United Kingdom]] following the birth of [[punk rock]], in particular the [[Situationist International|Situationist]]-influenced graphics of [[Sex Pistols]] artist [[Jamie Reid]], as well as that band's first single, "[[Anarchy in the U.K.]]". However, while the early punk scene appropriated anarchist imagery mainly for its shock or comedy value or at best as a desire for hedonist personal freedom,&lt;ref name="nosir"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dines|first=Mike|title=No Sir, I Won't: Reconsidering the Legacy of Crass and Anarcho-punk|url=https://www.academia.edu/3023089/No_Sir_I_Wont_Reconsidering_the_Legacy_of_Crass_and_Anarcho-punk|publisher=Academia.edu|accessdate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Savage|first=Jon|title=England's Dreaming, Revised Edition: Anarchy, Sex Pistols, Punk Rock, and Beyond|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|year=2002|page=204|isbn=978-0312288228}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crass]] along with neighbours [[Poison Girls]] may have been the first punk bands to expound serious anarchist ideas.&lt;ref name="nosir"/&gt; The concept (and aesthetics) of anarcho-punk was quickly picked up on by bands like [[Flux of Pink Indians]], [[Subhumans (UK band)|Subhumans]], [[Chumbawamba]] and [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]].&lt;ref name="berger"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=George|title=The story of Crass|publisher=London: Omnibus Press|year=2006|pages=67–68|isbn=1-84609-402-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
{{Anarchism sidebar |Culture}}

While anarcho-punk bands have been often ideologically varied, most groups could be categorized as adhering to [[anarchism without adjectives]], in that it embraces the syncretic fusion of many potentially differing ideological strains of anarchism. Some anarcho-punks identified with [[Anarcha-feminism|anarcha-feminists]] (e.g. [[Poison Girls]]), while others were [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]] (e.g. Exit-Stance). [[The Psalters]] are a folk punk band with an affiliation with [[Christian anarchism]], though most anarcho-punk bands are generally critical of Christianity.  Many anarcho-punks are supporters of issues such as [[animal rights]], [[racial equality]], [[gay rights]], [[feminism]], [[environmentalism]], [[anti-corporate activism|anti-corporatism]], worker's [[autonomy]], the [[anti-war]] movement, and the [[anti-globalisation]] movement.

Anarcho-punks have criticized the perceived flaws of the [[punk subculture|punk movement]] and the wider youth culture in general. Bands like [[Crass]] and [[Dead Kennedys]] have written songs that attack corporate co-option of the punk subculture, people who are deemed to have [[sold out]], and the violence between punks, [[skinhead]]s, [[B-boy]]s and other youth subcultures&lt;ref name="berger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=...In Which Crass Voluntarily Blow Their Own... |url=http://blog.southern.com/about-crass-records/ |publisher=[[Southern Records]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023025044/http://blog.southern.com/about-crass-records/ |archivedate=2014-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and within punk itself. Some anarcho-punks are [[straight edge]], claiming that [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], drugs and promiscuity  are instruments of oppression and are self-destructive because they cloud the mind and wear down a person's resistance to other types of oppression. Some also condemn the waste of land, water and resources necessary to grow crops to make alcohol, tobacco and drugs, forfeiting the potential to grow and manufacture food. Some may be straight edge for religious reasons, such as in the case of [[Christian anarchists|Christian]], [[Islam and anarchism|Muslim]], [[Buddhist anarchism|Buddhist]] anarcho-punks (see [[Anarchism and religion]] for more background).

Although Crass initially espoused [[pacifism]], this is not necessarily the case for all anarcho-punks. Despite the broader punk subculture's antagonism towards hippies, the ideals of the hippie counterculture were an influence on anarcho-punk. Crass were explicit regarding their associations with the hippie counterculture,&lt;ref name="berger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; and this influence has also carried over to crust punk.

===Direct action===
Anarcho-punks universally believe in [[direct action]], although the way in which this manifests itself varies greatly. Despite their differences in strategy, anarcho-punks often co-operate with each other. Many anarcho-punks are [[pacifism|pacifists]] (e.g. Crass and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]) and therefore believe in using non-violent means of achieving their aims. These include peaceful protest, [[refusal of work]], [[squatting]], economic [[sabotage]], [[dumpster diving]], [[graffiti]], [[culture jamming]], [[ecotage]], [[freeganism]], [[boycott]]ing, [[civil disobedience]], [[hacktivism]] and [[subvertising]]. Some anarcho-punks believe that violence or property damage is an acceptable way of achieving social change (e.g. [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]]). This manifests itself as [[riot]]ing, [[vandalism]], wire cutting, [[Hunt saboteur|hunt sabotage]], participation in [[Animal Liberation Front]]-, [[Earth Liberation Front]], or even [[Black Bloc]]-style activities, and in extreme cases, violence and bombings. Many anarchists dispute the applicability of the term "violence" to describe destruction of property, since they argue that destruction of property is done not to control an individual or institution but to take its control away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=César Chavez on the Pragmatics of Violence|url=http://www.american-philosophy.org/archives/past_conference_programs/pc2004/submissions/tp-2.htm|publisher=Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy (SAAP)|accessdate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fringe anarchists in middle of violent demonstrations|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64114222.html|publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DIY punk ethic===
Many anarcho-punk bands subscribe to a [[DIY ethic|''do-it-yourself'' ethic]]. A popular anarcho-punk slogan is "[[Do it yourself|DIY]] not [[EMI]]", a conscious rejection of a major [[record company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Maximum Rocknroll | issue = 255 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qFNbAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22DIY+not+EMI%22&amp;dq=%22DIY+not+EMI%22 | pages = 14 | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Peace News for Nonviolent Revolution|issue=2236–2259|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FNREAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22DIY+not+EMI%22&amp;dq=%22DIY+not+EMI%22|page=liv|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DIY (not EMI) in 2010|url=http://theefaction.wordpress.com/2010/09/05/diy-not-emi-in-2010/|publisher=Thee Faction|accessdate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many anarcho-punk bands were showcased on the ''[[Bullshit Detector]]'' series of LPs released by [[Crass Records]] and Resistance Productions between 1980 and 1994. Some anarcho-punk performers were part of the [[cassette culture]]. In this way, an attempt was made to bypass the traditional recording and distribution routes, with recordings often being made available in exchange for a blank tape and a self-addressed envelope. The anarcho-punk movement has its own network of [[fanzine]]s or [[punk zine]]s which disseminates news, ideas and [[Visual arts|artwork]] from the scene. These are DIY productions, tending to be produced in runs of hundreds at most. The zines are printed on [[photocopier]]s or duplicator machines, and distributed by hand at punk concerts, in radical bookstores and infoshops, and through the mail.

==Musical style and aesthetics==
Generally speaking anarcho-punk bands are often less focused on particular musical delivery and more on a totalized aesthetic that encompasses the entire creative process, from album and concert art, to political message, to the lifestyles of the band members themselves.&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d11374|pure_url=yes}} allmusic&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] quotation: {{quotation|...its ideology of personal freedom (musical self-expression ought to be available to anyone, regardless of technical ability), and also that the message tended to be more important than the music.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crass listed as band members the people who did their album art and live visuals. The message is sometimes considered to be much more important than the music.&lt;ref name="berger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; According to the punk aesthetic, one can express oneself and produce moving and serious works with limited means and technical ability.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Byrne2010"&gt;[[David Byrne]], Jeremy Deller (2010) [http://www.davidbyrne.com/news/press/articles/modernpainters_2010.php ''Audio Games''], in ''[[Modern Painters (magazine)|Modern Painters]]'', March 1, 2010 quotation: {{quotation|I think I embrace a bit of the punk aesthetic that one can express oneself with two chords if that’s all you know, and likewise one can make a great film with limited means or skills or clothes or furniture. It’s just as moving and serious as works that employ great skill and craft sometimes. Granted, when you learn that third chord, or more, you don’t have to continue making "simple" things, unless you want to. Sometimes that’s a problem.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for anarcho-punk songs to lack the usual rock structure of verses and a chorus, however, there are exceptions to this. For example, later [[Chumbawamba]] songs were at the same time anarcho-punk and pop-oriented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chumbawamba’s Long Voyage|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/07/chumbawambas-long-voyage/|publisher=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Imperial Crown Orb and Sceptre of Austria (Imperial Treasury).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Imperial Orb, Crown, and Sceptre of Austria]]
The '''Austrian Crown Jewels''' ({{lang-de|Insignien und Kleinodien}}) is a term denoting the [[regalia]] and vestments worn by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], and later by the [[Emperor of Austria]], during the [[coronation]] ceremony and other state functions.&lt;ref name="leithe-10"&gt;Leithe-Jasper 2004, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to the following objects: the crowns, [[sceptre]]s, [[globus cruciger|orbs]], swords, rings, crosses, holy [[relic]]s, and the royal robes, as well as several other objects connected with the ceremony.&lt;ref name="trenkler"&gt;Trenkler 2004, pp. 132–135.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection dates from the 10th to the 19th&amp;nbsp;centuries and reflects more than a thousand years of European history. It is kept at the [[Imperial Treasury, Vienna|Imperial Treasury]] in the [[Hofburg Palace]] in [[Vienna]], Austria.

The most outstanding objects are the insignia of the hereditary [[Empire of Austria]]. They consist of the [[Imperial Crown]], the Imperial Orb and Sceptre, the [[Mantle (royal garment)|mantle]] of the Austrian Empire, and the Coronation Robes of the [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]]. The Imperial Crown, Orb, Cross, and [[Holy Lance]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] are also highlights. The first five parts are also called the {{lang|de|Weltliche Schatzkammer}} (secular/worldly treasury) and the ecclesiastical part the {{lang|de|Geistliche Schatzkammer}} (spiritual treasury). The {{lang|de|Schatzkammer}} is under the administration of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] (Museum of Art History).

==Insignia of the Austrian hereditary homage==
Austria began as a small march and was later elevated to a [[duchy]], then [[archduchy]]. The house of [[Babenberg]] and later the [[Habsburg]] dynasty were the margraves, dukes and later archdukes of this fiefdom. After the death of the last Babenberg [[Duke of Austria|duke]], [[Frederick II of Austria|Frederick II]] in 1246, [[King of Bohemia|King]] [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II]] of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] took over for a while. He was, however, defeated by the [[King of the Romans]] [[Rudolf of Habsburg]] in 1278, with the help of his sons [[Albert I, Holy Roman Emperor|Albert]] and Rudolf. Rudolf then installed his son Albert as Duke of Austria. The enthronement ceremony of the new [[Archduke]] of Austria was not an actual [[coronation]], but more a ceremony of [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] by the [[Estates of the realm|estates]]. In the German language, this ceremony is called the {{lang|de|[[Erbhuldigung]]}}. The estates in [[parliament]] swore obedience to their new ruler, and he in turn guaranteed their rights and upheld their [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileges]]. However, in this ceremony [[Monarch|sovereign]] insignia were also used.

The Insignia consist of the Austrian [[archducal hat]] or archducal coronet, which was made for [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]'s entry into [[Frankfurt]] for his coronation as [[King of the Romans]] in 1764. The orb and the sceptre were in use as the royal insignia of the Kingdom of Bohemia until the early 17th century.

* The archducal hat is kept today at the [[Klosterneuburg Monastery]] in [[Lower Austria]]. ''Please see [[archducal hat]] for further information.''
* The [[ducal hat of Styria]] is kept at the [[Landesmuseum Joanneum]] in [[Graz]], Styria.

==Empire of Austria==
[[File:Imperial Crown of Austria (Vienna).JPG|thumb|Imperial Crown of the Austrian Empire]]
Among the most important regalia of the [[Austrian Empire]] are the following:

* The Crown of [[Rudolf II]], later '''Crown of the Austrian Empire''', (made by [[Jan Vermeyen]] in [[Prague]] in 1602). It is made of pure gold, partially enamelled and studded with [[diamond]]s, [[rubies]], [[spinel rubies]], [[sapphire]]s, [[pearl]]s, and cushioned with [[velvet]].

The [[#Holy Roman Empire|crown and the insignia of the Holy Roman Empire]] were kept at [[Nürnberg]] and were used only for coronation ceremonies. For all other occasions the emperors had to commission personal crowns, which (except for this one) have survived only in illustrations. This crown was originally the personal crown of emperor Rudolf II.  It is one of the most important works of the European goldsmith's art. Luckily this personal crown was spared the fate of many other crowns and not broken up after the death of the emperor in 1612.

The Rudolphian crown has three distinct, principal elements, which symbolise the right to rule: the [[circlet]] with its [[fleur-de-lis]] mounts in the shape of a royal crown (Rudolf II was the [[King of Bohemia]] and [[King of Hungary|Hungary]]), the high arch descending from the imperial crown, and the golden [[mitre]] symbolising the [[Divine right of kings|divine right]] of the emperor to rule. The pearls run in rows like lights. The crown is topped by a bluish-green emerald which symbolises heaven.

[[File:Friedrich von Amerling 003.jpg|left|thumb|Emperor Francis I wearing the imperial mantle and regalia]] 
In the four spherical triangles of the golden mitre, Rudolf is depicted in his four principal offices and titles: as victor over the Turks (''[[Imperator]]''), his coronation as [[Holy Roman emperor]] in [[Regensburg]] (''[[Augustus]]''), his ride up the coronation hill after his coronation as king of Hungary in Pozsony (in Slovak "[[Bratislava]]", in present-day [[Slovakia]]), and his procession at his coronation as king of Bohemia in Prague. The inscription inside the arch reads: {{lang|la|RVDOLPHVS II ROM(ANORVM) IMP(ERATOR) AVGVSTUS HVNG(ARIAE) ET BOH(EMIAE) REX CONSTRVXIT MDCII}} (tr. "Made for Rudolf II, Roman emperor, King of Hungary and Bohemia, in 1602").

The choice and number of the stones used have [[allegorical]] and [[Mysticism|mystical]] significance. Eight diamonds decorate the crown: eight is a holy number referring to the [[octagon]]al body of the imperial crown; the diamond is a symbol of [[Christ]].

Under threat from [[Napoleon]], [[emperor Francis II]] dissolved the thousand-year old [[Holy Roman Empire]] and proclaimed the [[Austrian Empire]] on August 11, 1804. He did not use the crown of the Holy Roman Empire but the old crown of Rudolf II as the crown of the new empire.

''For more detailed information, see [[Imperial Crown of Austria]].''

* The '''Imperial Orb and Sceptre''' (made by [[Andreas Osenbruck]] in Prague, between 1612 and 1615) were commissioned by [[emperor Matthias]], the successor to Rudolf II. Both insignia were made out of the same material as the crown, and followed the same concept. They are also partially enameled, and studded with rubies, sapphires and pearls.
* The '''Mantle of the Austrian Empire''' (designed by [[Philipp von Stubenrauch]] (1784–1848) and executed by [[Johann Fritz]], [[Master Gold Embroiderer]], in Vienna in 1830) was commissioned by emperor Francis I for the coronation of his son, [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand]], as younger King of Hungary. The mantle is made out of red velvet, [[ermine]], and [[white silk]], and pranked with a gold-[[embroidered]] scatter pattern formed of [[double-headed eagle|double eagles]] with the Austrian arms. The border is decorated with [[oak]] and [[Bay laurel|laurel]] leaves.
* The '''Coronation Robes of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia''' (also designed by Philipp von Stubenrauch and executed by Johann Fritz in Vienna in 1838) are patterned similar to the Mantle of the Austrian Empire, but made out of blue and orange velvet, with [[white moiré]], gold and [[silver]] [[embroidery]], ermine and [[lace]]. The edging of the mantle is accompanied by a line of [[medallions]] in which the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] is displayed. Parallel to this runs a broad ornamental border composed of sprays of [[Palm tree|palm]] [[fronds]], oak and laurel leaves.

After Napoleon's downfall and the [[Congress of Vienna]], the [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia]] was created under Austrian rule. When [[Ferdinand I of Austria|emperor Ferdinand I]] was to be crowned ''King of Lombardy and Venetia'' in [[Milan]] on 6 September 1838, the question arose as to the choice of appropriate insignia and coronation vestments. Only the Iron Crown already existed. The rest of the insignia and vestments had to be newly commissioned. When the Austrians were forced to withdraw from [[Italy]] in 1859, the vestments were brought to Vienna.

==Habsburg-Lorraine Household Treasure==
The '''Household Treasure''' contains items from the daily life of the Habsburg monarchs. The collection is vast and only a few highlights are featured regularly.

[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (80).JPG|thumb|upright|Cradle of the King of Rome]]
The '''Cradle of the King of Rome''' was commissioned by the city of [[Paris]] as a gift to Napoleon and his wife [[Empress Marie-Louise]], on the birth of their son [[Napoleon II]]. It was built by [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]], [[Henri-Victor Roguier]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Claude Odiot]] and [[Pierre-Philippe Thomire]] in Paris in 1811. The cradle is [[silver-gilt]], and decorated with gold, [[mother-of-pearl]], [[copper plates]] covered with velvet, silk and [[tulle]] with gold and silver embroidery, and signed on two of the feet: ''Odiot et Thomire'' and ''Thomire et Odiot''. [[Angels]] hold a little [[baldachin]] over the head, and a bird sits at the foot. [[Bees]], the symbol of the [[Bonaparte dynasty]], decorate the sides. The cradle was more a horizontal throne with all its splendour, and a more practical cradle was also commissioned, which is in the [[Louvre]] today.

[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (131).JPG|thumb|upright|Crown of Bocskay, Imperial Treasury, Hofburg Palace, Vienna]]
Another notable item listed in the Household Treasure is the '''Crown of [[Stephen Bocskay|István Bocskay]]'''. This [[Transylvania]]n prince sided with the [[Ottoman Turks]] during their wars with the Habsburg empire. As a sign of their gratitude, the Ottomans sent him a crown, probably a [[Safavid dynasty|Persian]] production from the 17th century. After his death, it was brought to Vienna in 1609. It is made out of gold, studded with precious stones and pearls, and laid in with silk. As crowns were not in use in the [[Ottoman Empire]], it was modeled after the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] {{transl|el|[[kamelaukion]]}} (closed [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]-like headdress), similar to those used in the [[Orthodox church]]. The crown has two main parts: a broad circlet with a wreath of fleurs-de-lis and a closed, spherical helmet rising from it. The frontal lily bears a [[Greek cross]].

More items are:
* Precious [[infant baptism|christening]] table clothes, robes, candles.
* Golden [[baptismal]] [[ewer]]s and [[bowl (vessel)|basins]] from Spain.
* An [[emerald]] [[Unguentarium]] commissioned by [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Ferdinand II]] and produced in Prague in 1641 by [[Dionysio Miseroni]]. It is made out of a single piece of {{convert|2680|carat|g}}  emerald, and enamelled with gold.
* [[Precious stones]] such as the [[zircon|Hyacinth]] "La Bella", and jewelry.

==Holy Roman Empire==
[[File:Holy Roman Empire Crown (Imperial Treasury).jpg|thumb|Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire, Imperial Treasury, Vienna]]
The '''[[Imperial Regalia]]''' are the insignia of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. After 1438, the Holy Roman Empire was ruled by the [[House of Habsburg]], with only one brief exception. From 1508, after his election, the [[German King]] no longer called for the coronation by the [[Pope]] either, but considered himself [[Roman emperor]] directly. The crown was probably used for the first time for the coronation of [[Konrad II]]; the last time was for [[Franz II]] in 1792.

The regalia were normally kept in [[Nuremberg]], and a smaller part in [[Aachen]]. However, with the advance of the French in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], they were taken away in 1796 and brought to Vienna for safety. They have remained in the Schatzkammer ever since, even after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. The cities of Aachen and Nuremberg tried many times, unsuccessfully, to reclaim the regalia. The regalia briefly left Vienna after the so-called "[[Anschluss]]", when [[Hitler]] had them sent to [[Nuremberg]] in 1938. After the war they were found by American troops in a bunker and eventually returned in 1946.

The regalia are made up of many pieces, some of which are more than a thousand years old. It is one of the most important and complete collections of medieval royal regalia. Some of the most important items are listed below:

* [[Imperial Holy Bible]]
* [[St. Stephen's Purse]]
* [[Sword of Charlemagne]]
* [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Crown]]
* [[Imperial Cross]]
* [[Holy Lance]]
* [[Imperial Sword]]
* [[Imperial Orb]]
* [[Coronation Mantle]]
* [[Ceremonial Sword]]
* [[Imperial Sceptre]]
* [[Vestments]]
* [[Reliquary|Reliquaries]]

==Burgundian Inheritance and Order of the Golden Fleece==
[[File:Schatzkammer Wien Collane Orden vom Goldenen Vlies.jpg|thumb|Neck Chain of a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece]]
* The Burgundian Inheritance are the items that are still left of the once-immense treasure of the [[dukes of Burgundy]]. It includes a precious pomp goblet that was created for [[Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy]] (ruled 1419-1467). It is set with gold and crafted out of single piece of [[rock-crystal]].
* The [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] was one of the most prestigious orders in the Middle Ages and still exists today, alongside the [[Order of the Garter]]. The current head of the Order is [[Karl Habsburg-Lothringen]]. It was founded by [[Duke Philip the Good]] and [[Isabella of Portugal, Duchess of Burgundy|Princess Isabella of Portugal]] in 1430. The Legend of the [[Golden Fleece]] goes back to [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], a well-known [[Greek myth]], according to which [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] stole the Golden Fleece from [[Colchis]].
The collection houses various items of the Order, such as neck chains of the knights, the Potence (Chain of Arms) of the [[Herald]] of the order, the liturgical vestments, [[altars]], etc.

==Ecclesiastical Treasury==
[[File:Ainkhürn.jpg|thumb|The Ainkhürn (horn of a unicorn)]]
The Ecclesiastical Treasury ({{lang|de|Geistliche Schatzkammer}}) contains various pieces such as crosses, altars, [[reliquaries]], [[icons]], holy statues, and other items that were used for prayer by the court and the Habsburgs. The collection is vast, so only a limited number of items are on permanent exhibition, the rest are shown in cycles.
* The Reliquary Cross of King [[Louis I of Hungary]] is a double-cross made out of gold with silver-gilt, enamel, and precious stones. In it, pieces of the [[True Cross of Christ]] are said to be preserved under rock-crystal. This reliquary cross used to belong to King Louis of Hungary, and was probably produced either in [[Hungary]] or [[Naples]], probably between 1370 and 1382.
* The House Altar of Jasper was made by [[Ottavio Miseroni]] in Prague, probably around 1620.
* The Reliquary with a Nail from the Cross was made in [[Augsburg]] in the mid-17th century.
* The Feather Picture of the Virgin Mary was made by the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] Indian artist [[Juan Baptiste Cuiris]] in [[Michoacán]] ([[Pátzcuaro]]), [[Mexico]], around 1550-1580. It is a picture of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], made completely out of sparkling [[Hummingbird]] and [[parrot]] [[feathers]]. The Mexican Indian artists from Amentaca were famous for their traditional skills in producing art out of feathers. There are all in all seven feather-pictures in the treasury, making it the largest collection of such specific items. It belonged to the collection of Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]].
* The Ainkhürn (horn of a [[unicorn]]) was originally thought to be the horn of a unicorn and was considered more valuable than gold, since magical healing powers were ascribed to it. The hilt of a sword was made from it, as well as a [[tankard]]. In reality, the horn probably came from a [[Narwhal]].
* The [[Agate Bowl]] ({{lang|de|Achatschale}}) is a bowl whose inscriptions are said to refer to Jesus Christ. It was at one time regarded as the [[Holy Grail]].

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Bestiarii (EUR Museum).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Relief of bestiarii and animals in the [[Museum of Roman Civilization]].]] --&gt;
Among [[Ancient Romans]], '''''bestiarii''''' (singular '''''bestiarius''''') were those who went into combat with beasts, or were exposed to them. It is conventional&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia"&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0247&amp;q1=bestiarii Entry on Bestiarii] at Chambers, Ephraim, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'', c. 1680-1740&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish two categories of ''bestiarii'': the first were those condemned to death via the beasts (see ''[[damnatio ad bestias]]'') and the second were those who faced them voluntarily, for pay or glory (see ''[[venatio]]'').&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;William Smith, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Bestiarii.html "Bestiarii"] from ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', John Murray: London, 1875. Public domain.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter are sometimes erroneously called ''[[gladiator]]s''; to their contemporaries, however, the term ''gladiator'' referred specifically to one who fought other men. The contemporary term for those who made a career out of participating in arena "hunts" was '''[[List of Roman gladiator types#Venator|venatores]]'''.

== As a form of execution ==
As a means of [[torture|torturous]] [[capital punishment]], death by wild beasts was a punishment for [[enemy of the state|enemies of the state]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/bestiarii.html The Bestiarius and the Ludus Matutinus]&lt;/ref&gt; a category which included those taken prisoner and slaves found guilty of a serious crime. These were sent to their deaths naked and unable to defend themselves against the beasts. Even if they succeeded in killing one, fresh animals were continually let loose on them, until the ''bestiarii'' were all dead. It is reported that it was seldom necessary for two beasts to be required to take down one man. On the contrary, one beast frequently dispatched several men. [[Cicero]] mentions a single lion which alone dispatched 200 ''bestiarii''.&lt;!--all at once, or over time?--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia"/&gt;

== Voluntary combat ==
''Bestiarii'', as reported by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]],&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia"/&gt; consisted of young men who, to become expert in managing their arms, fought sometimes against beasts, and sometimes against one another; and of bravos who, to show their courage and dexterity, exposed themselves to this dangerous combat. [[Augustus]] encouraged this practice in young men of the first rank; [[Nero]] exposed himself to it; and it was for killing beasts in the [[amphitheatre]] that [[Commodus]] acquired the title of the Roman [[Hercules]].&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia"/&gt;

[[Blaise de Vigenère|Vigenère]] adds two more types of ''bestiarii'':&lt;ref&gt;''Cyclopaedia'', apparently referring to some one of Vigenère's French translations of Latin works, such as his translation of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s ''[[Caesar's Commentaries (disambiguation)|Commentaries]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the first were those who made a trade of it, and fought for money. It appears that there were schools in Rome, in which people were trained to fight wild beasts (''scholae bestiarum'', or ''bestiariorum'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]]'s ''[[Apologeticus]]'', [http://www.tertullian.org/latin/apologeticum_becker.htm#C35 chapter 35]; cited in Smith 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; The second type was where several armed ''bestiarii'' were let loose at once against a number of beasts.&lt;ref name="Cyclopaedia"/&gt;

[[File:Bhesties-John Luard-1838.jpg|220px|thumb|''Bhesties'', an 1838 illustration showing Bhishtis]]
The '''Bhishti''' ([[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]: भिश्ती, بهِشتی) are a [[Muslim]]  tribe or ''biradari'' found in [[North India]], [[Pakistan]] and the [[Terai]] region of [[Nepal]]. They are also known as '''(Shaikh Abbasi) [[Dhund Abbasi]]''' and '''Saqqa''', and use Sheikh Abbasi, or Dhund-Abbasi,  as a surname. In [[Maharashtra]], the tribe is often referred to as '''Pakhali'''.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII  Part One edited by A. Hasan &amp; J. C. Das pages 285 to 287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B.V Bhanu, B.R Bhatnagar pages 336-337"&gt;People of India Maharshtra Volume XXX  Part One edited by B.V Bhanu, B.R Bhatnagar, D.K Bose, V.S Kulkarni and J Sreenath pages 336-337&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sheikh Abbasi belong to Arab Tribe ([[Banu Abbas]]). The title character of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem "[[Gunga Din]]" is a Bhisti.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bartleby.com/103/48.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==

The Sheikh Abbasi are the traditional water carriers&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bheesty |volume=3 |page=845}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[South Asia]],&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII edited by A. Hasan &amp; J. C. Das page 285&lt;/ref&gt; and the word Bhishti is derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''behesht'', meaning paradise,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and the name is said to have been given to the community on account of their ministering to [[Muslim]] soldiers at a battle. They were historically the suppliers of water from a [[goatskin (container)|goat-skin]] bag known as the ''[[mashk]]'' or ''mashq''.

In [[Gujarat]], the Bhishti claim to have come from [[North India]] during the rule of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar]]. Like the Bhishti of [[North India]], they claim to be [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasi]] [[Arabs]], who provided water for the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] armies that conquered [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="Volume XXII Part One Editors R pages 231"&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXII Part One Editors R. B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan and M Azeez Mohideen pages 231 to 231&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhisti of [[Maharashtra]] are unaware of their origin, although many now claim to be belong to the Abbasi community. They are found mainly in the districts of [[Sangli District|Sangli]], [[Sholapur District|Sholapur]], [[Kolhapur District|Kolhapur]] and [[Pune District|Pune]]. The community speak the [[Dakhini]] dialect of [[Urdu]], as well as [[Marathi language|Marathi]].&lt;ref name="B.V Bhanu, B.R Bhatnagar pages 336-337"/&gt;

A good many Shaikh Abbasi of [[Delhi]] emigrated to [[Pakistan]], at the [[partition of India]]. They are now found mainly in [[Karachi]], and form a sub-group within the larger [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajir]] ethnic group.&lt;ref name="T Ghosh pages 635"&gt;People of India Delhi Volume XX edited by T Ghosh  &amp; S Nath pages 635 to 637&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The Bhishti of [[Uttar Pradesh]] are a landless community. In addition to carrying water, the community are involved in wage labour. They also supply drinking water during the festivals and religious gatherings. The [[Uttar Pradesh]] Bhishti are strictly [[endogamy|endogamous]], marrying close kin. They speak [[Urdu]], as well as regional dialects such as [[Khari boli]]. The Bhishti consist of a number of clans known as ''biradaris'', which are supposedly descended from a common ancestor. Their main biradaris are the Abbasi, Beg, Simri chauhan, Behlim, Faruqi, Turki and Turkmen. Although the Bhishti are found throughout Uttar Pradesh, their greatest concentration are in the [[Doab]] districts of [[Aligarh District|Aligarh]] and [[Meerut District|Meerut]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 286&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Delhi]], the Abbasi are employed as water suppliers to the Delhi Municipality. They are also employed as motor mechanics, carpenters, welders, turners, fitters and painters. The Bhishti are [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s, although they also incorporate elements of folk belief. Like other [[Muslim]] artisan [[caste]]s, the Bhishti have set up an [[India]]- wide caste association, the All-India Jamiat ul Abbas, which acts both as a welfare association, as well as organization involved with lobbying on behalf of the Bhishti in [[India]]. The community has been granted [[Other Backward Classes|Other Backward Class]] status.&lt;ref name="T Ghosh pages 635"/&gt;

In [[Gujarat]], the Bhishti are now landless, and are employed as wage labourers. Many are also involved as rickshaw pullers, with a few involved in the manufacturing of [[bidis]], the traditional cigarette  of [[India]]. The Bhishti now speak [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], and live mainly in [[Ahmedabad]]. Like other [[Gujarati Muslim]]s, they have a [[caste]] association. They are [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s, with many belonging to the [[Deobandi]] sub-sect.&lt;ref name="Volume XXII Part One Editors R pages 231"/&gt;

The Bhisti of [[Maharashtra]] are also an endogamous community and marry close kin. They practice both cross cousin and parallel cousin marriages. There traditional occupation of water carrying is now obsolete, and the community are engaged in a number of occupations. A good many are wage labourers, with a small minority who is involved in business. Despite the disappearance of their traditional occupation, community identity remains strong. The Bhisti have set up their own caste association, the Maharashtra Bhishti Samaj. This acts as an instrument of community of welfare, and well as pressure group on behalf of the community.All the (dhund)Abbasi biradaries are the same in the all provinces of Pakistan as well.&lt;ref name="B.V Bhanu, B.R Bhatnagar pages 336-337"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3908">In the United States, a '''blue-ribbon panel''' (or '''blue ribbon commission''') is a group of exceptional people appointed to investigate, study or analyze a given question. Blue-ribbon panels generally have a degree of independence from political influence or other authority, and such panels usually have no direct authority of their own. Their value comes from their ability to use their expertise to issue findings or recommendations which can then be used by those with decision-making power to act.

A blue-ribbon panel is often appointed by a [[government]] body or executive to report on a matter of [[controversy]]. It might be composed of independent scientific experts or academics with no direct government ties to study a particular issue or question, or it might be composed of [[citizens]] well known for their general intelligence, experience and [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan]] interests to study a matter of political reform. The "[[Blue ribbon|blue-ribbon]]" aspect comes from the presentation of the panel as the "best and brightest" for the task, and the appointment of such a panel, [[ad hoc]], is meant to signal its perspective as outsiders of the usual process for study and decisions.

The designation "blue-ribbon" is often made by the appointing authority, and may be disputed by others who might see the panel as less independent, or as a way for an authority to dodge responsibility.

Examples of high-level so-called blue-ribbon panels in the United States would be the [[Warren Commission]] investigating the [[John F.

In each case, the panel did not have authority to indict or [[Legislation|legislate]], and their brief was to investigate and issue a report on the facts as they found them with recommendations for changes for government [[policy]] in the future.

The term has leaked into official usage. From January 29, 2010 to January 2012, the U.S. had a [[Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future]].&lt;ref&gt;http://brc.gov/ Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future&lt;/ref&gt; There are other government and private commissions with "Blue Ribbon Commission" in their names. These and others are often referred to simply as "the Blue Ribbon Commission" or "the blue ribbon commission", creating the potential for confusion.

==Popular reference==

A blue ribbon panel concerning a police shooting appears in the television series ''[[The Good Wife]]'' in season 3 episode 19. It deals with the problems such panels face in order to reach conclusions under political influence.

A blue ribbon panel is also mentioned in the television series ''[[The West Wing]]'' in season 2 episode 15.  It deals with modifying politically controversial aspects of the [[Social Security (United States)|US Social Security program]] such as raising the retirement age.

'''British Mexicans''' are  [[Mexico|Mexicans]] of British descent or [[UK|British]]-born persons who have become naturalized citizens of Mexico.

The British have had a presence in Mexico since the Colonial era. However, the greatest exchange occurred following independence, notably with the Cornish miners in Hidalgo.{{clarify|reason=missing noun?|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Iglesia Metodista del Divino Salvador, Pachuca, Hidalgo, México, 2013-10-10, DD 01.JPG|thumb|250px|left|The ''El Divino Salvador'' Methodist Church in Pachuca was founded by Cornish immigrants and Mexican converts. The current building was inaugurated in 1901.]]

During the Colonial era, the Spanish restricted the entrance of other Europeans, however, some non-Spanish Europeans were present. In 1556, the English adventurer Robert Thomson encountered the Scotsman Tomás Blaque (Thomas Blake), who had been living in Mexico City for more than twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Melbourne Review, Volume 9|date=1884|publisher=S.

During his third voyage, the ship commanded by [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] escaped destruction at the [[Battle of San Juan de Ulúa (1568)]]. However, after becoming lost in the Gulf of Mexico and with a bloated crew, Hawkins abandoned more than one hundred men near [[Tampico]].&lt;ref name="Gunn"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gunn|first1=Drewey Wayne|title=American and British Writers in Mexico, 1556-1973|date=2014|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292773110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIH8AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT7&amp;dq=british+writers+in+mexico&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0586u8KfOAhVq5oMKHVSyCIMQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20writers%20in%20mexico&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 August 2016|chapter=British Travelers in New Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of the men went north (including [[David Ingram (explorer)|David Ingram]]), while the rest went south and were captured by the Spanish. Notable among this group was [[:s:Philips, Miles (DNB00)|Miles Philips]] who wrote a narrative detailing his and the other Englishmen's struggles. They were taken to Mexico City, given care at a hospital and imprisoned. After attempting to escape, they were sold as servants or slaves.&lt;ref name="Gunn" /&gt; Some were able to accumulate wealth by rising to the position of overseers at mines and other operations. However, after the establishment of the [[Mexican Inquisition]], the men were stripped of any wealth and imprisoned as Lutheran heretics. Three of the men were burned, while some sixty were given [[penance]].&lt;ref name="Gunn" /&gt;

Various British [[privateers]] and pirates repeatedly attacked the coastal cities of New Spain, [[Sack of Campeche (1663)|most famously]] in [[Campeche, Campeche|Campeche]]. In southern Baja California Sur, a few families retain the English surname "Green". This surname is sometimes cited as a legacy of the British pirates who frequented the [[Los Cabos|Cape region]]. However, the founder was established to be Esteban Green, an English whaler that settled in the region in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martínez Márquez|first1=Pablo L.|title=Guía Familiar de Baja California. 1700-1900|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/2036744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[great power]] that recognized the independence of Mexico was the United Kingdom in 1824, shortly after the sale of mines from [[Pachuca]] and [[Real del Monte]] occurred. The majority of migrants to this region came from what is now termed the Cornish "central mining district" of [[Camborne]] and [[Redruth]]. Real del Monte's steep streets, stairways and small squares are lined with low buildings and many houses with high sloping roofs and chimneys which indicate a Cornish influence. Mexican remittances from these miners helped to build the Wesleyan Chapel in Redruth.

The [[Panteón de Dolores]], which became the largest cemetery in Mexico, was founded in 1875 by Juan Manuel Benfield, the son of [[Anglican]] immigrants. Benfield fulfilled his father's goal of creating a cemetery after his sister was refused burial in Catholic cemeteries and had to be interred at a beach.&lt;ref name="Herrera"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herrera Moreno|first1=Ethel|title=El Panteón de Dolores y sus inicios|url=http://boletin-cnmh.inah.gob.mx/boletin/boletines/3EV2P77.pdf|publisher=[[INAH]]|accessdate=20 February 2016|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1895 National Census, 3,263 residents were from the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Censo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Los extranjeros en México |url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/integracion/pais/historicas10/Tema1_Poblacion.pdf |publisher=INEGI |accessdate=2 August 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225617/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/integracion/pais/historicas10/Tema1_Poblacion.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The twin silver mining settlements of Pachuca and Real del Monte are being marketed as of 2007 as 'Mexico's Little Cornwall' by the Mexican Embassy in [[London]] and represent the first attempt by the Spanish speaking part of the [[Cornish diaspora]] to establish formal links with Cornwall. The Mexican Embassy in London is also trying to establish a town twinning arrangement with Cornwall. In 2008 thirty members of the [[Cornish Mexican Cultural Society]] travelled to Mexico to try and re-trace the path of their ancestors who set off from Cornwall to start a new life in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/content/articles/2008/09/30/south_west_cornish_miners_s14_w3_feature.shtml BBC - The Cornish in Mexico]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

Football clubs founded by Britons included the [[British Club (football)|British Club]], [[Rovers FC Mexico]] and [[Reforma Athletic Club]]. The most successful club founded by Britons is [[C.F. Pachuca]].

===Cuisine===
The ''[[Paste (pasty)|paste]]'' is a pastry with [[Pasty#Cornish pasty|Cornish roots]]. Introduced by miners from Cornwall who were contracted in the towns of Real del Monte and Pachuca in Hidalgo.&lt;ref name="Museum"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Millward, David|date=14 November 2011|title=World's first Cornish pasty museum opens in Mexico|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=UK|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8887155/Worlds-first-Cornish-pasty-museum-opens-in-Mexico.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cornish miners may have also introduced the [[turnip]] to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rider|first1=Nick|title=Cornish Mexico: How the pasty was transported to the Sierras|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/americas/cornish-mexico-how-the-pasty-was-transported-to-the-sierras-10516452.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Mathew D. McCubbins|Mathew McCubbins]], [[Roger Noll]], and [[Barry Weingast]] first defined the theory of bureaucratic drift in 1987.&lt;ref name="McCubbins"/&gt; They argued that drift is essentially a principal-agent problem that explores "how—or indeed, whether—elected political officials can reasonably effectively assure that their policy intentions will be carried out."&lt;ref name="McCubbins"/&gt; The major tenets of the theory include how bureaucrats can manipulate policy when creating bureaucratic agencies and the argument that delay built into the bureaucracy is a good thing, because delay gives government a chance to perfect a policy over time.&lt;ref name="McCubbins"/&gt;

In 1989, Murray Horn and Kenneth Shepsle proposed that coalitional drift, the phenomenon of present legislation being overwritten by the changing views of [[political coalitions]], is a trade-off to bureaucratic drift.&lt;ref name="Horn"/&gt; The relationship between bureaucratic and coalitional drift is a disputed part of the bureaucratic drift theory.&lt;ref name="Macey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shepsle(1992)" /&gt;

In 1992, [[Jonathan R. Macey|Jonathan Macey]] hypothesized that the creation of an agency's structure and design is instrumental in preventing bureaucratic drift.&lt;ref name="Macey"/&gt; Macey speculates that both current interest groups and Congress benefit from the careful structure and design of a bureaucratic agency. The former is pleased by policies that continue to reflect their preferences while the latter is pleased that both bureaucratic and coalitional drift are protected against.&lt;ref name="Macey"/&gt; Contrary to Horn and Shepsle, Macey argues that coalitional drift and bureaucratic drift aren't necessarily opposing forces, but that the careful construction of an agency's structure and design can mitigate the costs of both types of drift.&lt;ref name="Macey"/&gt; He also disagrees with McCubbins, Noll and Weingast on the power of delay to reduce bureaucratic drift, because extra time gives future interest groups and a future Congress the opportunity to insert their own preferences into the proposed policy.&lt;ref name="Macey"/&gt; This is an example of coalitional and bureaucratic drift working counter to each other.

==Causes==
Scholars have identified three major areas that contribute to bureaucratic drift: how bureaucracies are structured, interest groups that lobby bureaucracies, and presidential appointments of bureaucratic leaders.

===Structural===
Bureaucratic agencies are often structured so that legislators and their staffers have the opportunity to easily monitor bureaucratic activity.&lt;ref name = Shepsle(1992)&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shepsle|first=Kenneth|title=Bureaucratic Drift, Coalitional Drift, and Time Consistency: A Comment on Macey|journal=Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization|date=March 1992|jstor=10.2307/764892}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some scholars believe that structural organization can help lessen bureaucratic drift,&lt;ref name = Macy(1992)&gt;{{cite journal|last=Macey|first=Jonathan|title=Organizational Design and Political Control of Administrative Agencies|journal=Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization|date=March 1992|volume=8|jstor=10.2307/764891}}&lt;/ref&gt; other scholars have found that this approach can backfire.&lt;ref name = "Shepsle(1992)"/&gt; When a bureaucracy is permeable anyone can access it, including legislators who were originally adverse to the legislation being implemented.&lt;ref name = "Shepsle(1992)"/&gt; Further, scholars argue that if a bureaucratic agency is designed to represent a single interest, its implementations are more likely to reflect the views of the people they are representing than they are the views of the legislature.&lt;ref name = "Macy(1992)"/&gt;

===Lobbying===
Making bureaucracies easily accessible means that interest groups can have a greater influence on the outcome of policy implementation.&lt;ref name = "Macy(1992)"/&gt; Some scholars believe that bureaucracies can have positive interactions with interest groups.&lt;ref name = Chubbs&gt;{{cite book|last=Chubb|first=John|title=Interest groups and the bureaucracy: the politics of energy|year=1983|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Sanford, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such an interaction is when interest groups support bureaucracies by providing information and facts about areas the bureaucracy is meant to promote or serve.&lt;ref name = "Chubbs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=John|title=Interest Groups, Advisory Committees, and Congressional Control of the Bureaucracy|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=October 2001|doi=10.2307/2669325|volume=45|pages=799}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars, however, have found that interest groups can cause bureaucratic drift. When a bureaucratic agency is infiltrated or corrupted by an external group whose views do not align with the preferences of the legislature it is said that the bureaucratic agency is captured.&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Stuart|title=Procedural Control of the Bureaucracy, Peer Review and Epistemic Drift|journal=Journal of Public Administrative Research and Theory|pages=535–538|doi=10.1093/jopart/mul026|volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schoenbrod&gt;{{cite book|last=Schoenbrod|first=David|title=Power Without Responsibility|year=1993|publisher=Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an interest group negotiates with a bureaucracy, it can bias the bureaucracy to implement policy that drifts from the original intention of the legislation so the policy instead better serves the needs of the interest group.&lt;ref name = Bertelli&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bertelli|first=Anthony|title=Remedial Bargaining and Bureaucratic Drift|journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Politics]]|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential appointments===
Scholars consider presidents active in the affairs of "independent" bureaucracies.&lt;ref name = Cromartie&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Joseph|author2=Jane S. Cromartie|title=Partisan Presidential Change and Regulatory Policy: The Case of the FTC and Deceptive Practices Enforcement|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly|year=1982|volume=12|issue=4|jstor=10.2307/27547869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presidential nominations are sometimes considered a check on bureaucracies because it ensures reliable agent performance.&lt;ref name=LGS /&gt; However, presidents can use appointments for political gain.&lt;ref name=Nokken&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nokken|first=Timothy|title=Confirmation Dynamics: A Model of Presidential Appointments to Independent Agencies|journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Politics]]|volume=12|issue=1|pages=91–112|doi=10.1177/0951692800012001004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A president may wish to maintain bureaucratic drift if it lies in his or her favor.&lt;ref name="Nokken"/&gt;  An administrative agency can be captured by a president when he or she appoints a bureaucratic head that reaffirms bureaucratic drift that is favorable to the president's policies.&lt;ref name=Balla&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balla|first=Steven|title=Administrative Procedures and Political Control of the Bureaucracy|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=92|issue=3|pages=663–673|doi=10.2307/2585488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Nokken"/&gt;  In cases where bureaucratic drift is present, scholars believe that the president can change policy more rapidly than in a zero-drift scenario.&lt;ref name = "Balla"/&gt;

==Checks==

===Legislative checks===

Through congressional acts, the legislative branch has the power to curb bureaucratic drift.&lt;ref name="textbook"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lowi, Theodore J.|author2=Benjamin Ginsberg|author3=Kenneth A.

[[Mathew D. McCubbins|Mathew McCubbins]] and Thomas Schwartz have categorized oversight into two types- police patrol and fire alarm patrol.&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbins-Schwartz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="firealarm"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lupia | first1 = Arthur | last2 = McCubbins | first2 = Mathew D. | year = 1994 | title = Learning from Oversight: Fire Alarms and Police Patrols Reconstructed | journal = Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 96–117 | jstor=764815 | doi=10.1093/jleo/10.1.96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police patrol refers to oversight when legislators instigate investigations into bureaucracies and actively search for bureaucratic drift.&lt;ref name="McCubbins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="firealarm"/&gt; Such oversight may involve legislators monitoring agencies, reading reports, conducting field studies, and questioning officials.&lt;ref name="McCubbins"/&gt; Unlike police patrol, Congress also uses fire-alarm patrol by constructing procedures that allow citizens and interest groups to alert legislators of drift.&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="firealarm"/&gt; This method involves less action by congress, and McCubbins and Schwartz argue that it is preferred by legislators as it allows them to devote less time and resources to oversight.&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbins-Schwartz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hopenhayn"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hopenhayn | first1 = Hugo | last2 = Lohmann | first2 = Susanne | year = 1996 | title = Fire-Alarm Signals and the Political Oversight of Regulatory Agencies | journal = Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 196–212 | jstor=765043 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jleo.a023357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ogul | first1 = Morris S. | last2 = Rockman | first2 = Bert A. | year = 1990 | title = Overseeing Oversight: New Departures and Old Problems | journal = Legislative Studies Quarterly | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 5–24 | jstor=439999 | doi=10.2307/439999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars criticize fire-alarm patrol by arguing that citizens' complaints may never reach legislators and those that do may be deceitful, thus sounding "false alarms".&lt;ref name="firealarm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hopenhayn"/&gt;

===Judicial checks===

Because of the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]], the judicial branch is able to check bureaucratic drift through [[judicial review]].&lt;ref name="Macey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesquita"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mesquita | first1 = De | last2 = Bueno | first2 = Ethan | last3 = Stephenson | first3 = Matthew C. | year = 2007 | title = Regulatory Quality Under Imperfect Oversight | url = | journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 101 | issue = 3| page = 605 | doi=10.1017/s0003055407070359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Epstein"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Epstein | first1 = David | last2 = O'Halloran | first2 = Sharyn | year = 1994 | title = Administrative Procedures, Information, and Agency Discretion | journal = American Journal of Political Science | volume = 38 | issue = 3| pages = 697–722 | jstor=2111603 | doi=10.2307/2111603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macey2"&gt;Macey, Jonathon R. "Separated Powers and Positive Political Theory: The tug of war over Administrative 	Agencies" Yale Law School Scholarship 1/1/1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephenson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stephenson | first1 = Matthew C | year = 2007 | title = Bureaucratic Decision Costs and Endogenous Agency Expertise | url = | journal = Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization | volume = 23 | issue = 2| pages = 469–498 | doi=10.1093/jleo/ewm030}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scholars have argued that the judicial branch checks bureaucratic drift most efficiently when controlling delays of implementing law. Timing is important because the process gives less organized groups time to learn about proposed actions and respond to these proposals.&lt;ref name=Macey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macey2/&gt;
The same scholars point out that ongoing delays caused by judicial review on agency actions may discourage less organized interest, because such groups lack the resources necessary to maintain an effective coalition over long periods of time.&lt;ref name=Macey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macey2/&gt; Other scholars argue that judicial review also allows less organized groups to hire lawyers to assist in monitoring agency actions.&lt;ref name=Macey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Horn/&gt;

===Executive checks===

The president has the power to check bureaucratic drift through [[executive order]]s and by choosing appointees for the highest post of bureaucracies.&lt;ref name="McCubbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Balla" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Macey2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = B. Dan | last2 = Bohte | first2 = John | year = 2004 | title = Political Transaction Costs and the Politics of Administrative Design | url = | journal = The Journal of Politics | volume = 66 | issue = 1| pages = 176–202 | jstor = 3449778 | doi=10.1046/j.1468-2508.2004.00147.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A president can attempt to affect drift by choosing appointees whose preferences closely resemble his or her own.&lt;ref name=McCubbins/&gt;&lt;ref name=Balla/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macey2/&gt;
Also cabinet officials have their own independent evaluation staffs in charge of ensuring that agencies do not drift from government decisions.&lt;ref name=McCubbins/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wood/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lowi"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lowi, Theodore J.|author2=Benjamin Ginsberg|author3=Kenneth A. Shepsle|title=American Government: Power and Purpose|location=New York|publisher=Norton|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monitoring bureaucratic agencies is also possible through the [[Office of Management and Budget]] as well as the White House staff.&lt;ref name=McCubbins/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesquita"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowi/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidenfeld"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seidenfeld | first1 = Mark | year = 2001 | title = The Psychology of Accountability and Political Review of Agency Rules | url = | journal = Duke Law Journal | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 1059–1095 | doi=10.2307/1373184}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since Congress controls the amount of money appropriated to bureaucratic agencies, monitoring by the Office of Management and Budget is limited.&lt;ref name=Balla/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesquita"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macey2/&gt; The [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]], a division of the Office of Management and Budget, can delay agency regulations it deems unsatisfactory.&lt;ref name="Mesquita"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidenfeld"/&gt;
Scholars argue that one problem of the executive branch working to reduce bureaucratic drift is that it wastes time and resources that could be spent serving constituents.&lt;ref name=McCubbins/&gt;&lt;ref name=Balla/&gt;
Also other scholars point out that future coalitions may tamper with carefully negotiated bargains. Therefore executives often focus more on work they can immediately benefit from.&lt;ref name="Horn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shipan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shipan, Charles R.|title=Designing Judicial Review: Interest Groups, Congress, and Communications Policy|location=Ann Arbor|publisher=University of Michigan |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
While some scholars believe that delegation is a necessary part of the American government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = Marci A | year = 1995 | title = Power, Responsibility, and Republican Democracy | url = | journal = Michigan Law Review | volume = 93 | issue = 6| pages = 1539–1558 | doi=10.2307/1289892}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and that bureaucratic drift is a risk that must be weighed when delegating implementation powers, others believe that delegation of power to bureaucracy is both unconstitutional and happens too frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | first1 = Marc | last2 = Meier | first2 = Kenneth J. | year = 1990 | title = Presidential Control versus Bureaucratic Power: Explaining the Reagan Revolution in Antitrust | journal = American Journal of Political Science | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 269–87 | jstor=2111519 | doi = 10.2307/2111519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schoenbrod | first1 = David | year = 2003 | title = Politics and the Principle That Elected Legislators Should Make the Laws | url = | journal = Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy | volume = 26 | issue = 1| page = 239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Schoenbrod, David|title=Rule of law: It's time Congress took back its power to make laws|work=Wall Street Journal, |edition=Eastern|date=6 December 1995|page=A21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Does Congress Delegate Too Much Power To Agencies And What Should Be Done About It? US House of Representatives, 2000. {{ISBN|0160659973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  These scholars subscribe to the Non-delegation Doctrine, and believe that the risk posed by bureaucratic drift is disruptive enough to American politics that delegation must be reconsidered or even eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bergin | first1 = Amee | year = 2001 | title = Does Application Of The APA'S 'Committed To Agency Discretion' Exception Violate The Nondelegation Doctrine? | url = | journal = Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review | volume = 28 | issue = 2-3| pages = 363–398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schoenbrod, David|title=Power Without Responsibility: How Congress Abuses the People Through Delegation|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2892">'''Child pornography laws in Portugal''' state that such pornography is statutorily criminalised in the [[Portuguese Criminal Code]]. 

==Age of consent==
The [[Ages of consent in Europe#Portugal|age of sexual content]] in Portugal is, in principle, '''14''' years of age.  The participation of underage persons in pornographic scenes is subject to stricter standards, however, because they are subject to the general regime of adulthood, which was set by the Civil Code at the age of 18.

==Criminalized behaviours==
Section 176 of the Portuguese Criminal Code criminalises the following behaviours: 
* use or the incitement of an underaged person to participate in a pornographic scene (including live sex shows, photos, tapes, digital recordings, etc.)
* production or the distribution of any materials containing underaged persons engaging in pornography
* possession of pornographic materials containing underaged persons engaging in pornography with the purpose of distributing them
* use, incitement to use, production, distribution or possession with the intention of distribution of pornographic materials containing a realistic representation of an under aged person

==Penalties against pornographic involvement==
This is a complex provision that, in practice, attempts to ban the participation of all persons below age 18 in any kind of scene of a pornographic nature.  

The standard penalty for any of these actions is [[imprisonment]] for a period between one and five years. This standard penalty is subject to a number of aggravations and attenuations, however, depending on the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;See section 177 of the Portuguese Criminal Code&lt;/ref&gt;

This section of the Criminal Code has raised severe controversy{{fact|date=July 2012}}.  Its terminology is imprecise since it does not define "''pornographic scene''".  Also, many{{fact|date=July 2012}} have criticised the criminalisation of the "''realistic representation of minors''" because they see it a disproportionate restriction of the freedom of expression, a fundamental right protected by the Portuguese Constitution. 

These difficulties caused Portuguese courts to be extremely cautious in applying this section of the Criminal Code{{fact|date=July 2012}}. The [[case law]] varies widely and there is no [[legal certainty]] concerning the application of this provision.

'''Chilean Brazilians''' ({{lang-pt|Chileno-brasileiros}}, Spanish: ''Chileno-brasileños'') are Brazilian citizens of full, partial, or predominantly Chilean ancestry or [[Chile]]-born people who reside in [[Brazil]].

Emigration of [[Chileans]] has decreased during the last decade: It is estimated that 857,781 Chileans live abroad, 50.1% of those being in Argentina (the highest number), 13.3% in Brazil and 8.8% in the [[United States]].

It is likely that many date to medieval times or earlier – a cluster of small single-storey cottages of farmers and/or fishermen, invariably found on poorer land. They were often related to the [[rundale]] system of farming. According to David Lloyd, the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in Ireland (1845–49) caused such disruption to the social system that the clachans there virtually disappeared&lt;ref&gt;D. Lloyd. ''Irish Times: Temporalities of Modernity'', Field Day Books, Dublin, 2008, p. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;; many in the Scottish Highlands were victims of the [[Highland Clearances|Clearances]]. In some cases, they have evolved into holiday villages, or one or two houses have taken over, turning smaller houses into agricultural outhouses.  Remains can be seen in many upland and coastal areas.  Some are clustered in a dip in the landscape, to protect from Atlantic winds, but others stretch haphazardly along main roads.

==Etymology==
The word is composed of two elements, ''clach/cloch'' meaning "stone" and the masculine diminutive suffix ''-an/-án''. It originally denoted one of two things:
* a monastic stone-cell ([[clochán]]).&lt;ref name=MacBain/&gt;
* a paved road or causeway which in the earliest period were most commonly found leading to or from a church or cell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dil.ie/results-list.asp?mode=BAS&amp;Fuzzy=0&amp;searchtext=cloch%C3%A1n&amp;findlet=+&amp;findcol=&amp;sortField=ID&amp;sortDIR=65602&amp;respage=0&amp;resperpage=10&amp;bhcp=1 |title=eDIL |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Royal Irish Academy]] &amp; [[University of Ulster]] |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This should not be confused with the Scottish Gaelic plural of ''clach'' which is ''clachan'' "stones", a [[homograph]] but not a [[homophone]] as it is pronounced /kʰl̪ˠaxən/.

==Examples==
In Ireland:
* [[Cloghane]] in [[County Kerry]]
* [[Cloghan, County Offaly]]
* [[Cloghan, County Donegal]]
* [[Cloghanmore]] in [[Donegal]]
* [[Menlo, County Galway|Menlo]]/[[Mionloch]] in [[Galway]]

In the meaning of "causeway", the most prominent example in Irish is the [[Giant's Causeway]], known in Irish as ''Clochán an Aifir'' or ''Clochán na bhFomhórach''.

In Scotland, clachans can be found in [[Argyll and Bute]], Highland [[Perthshire]] and in the [[Highland Council]] region but also elsewhere, for example:
* [[Clachan of Campsie]]
* [[Glendaruel|Clachan of Glendaruel]] in Argyll
* [[Clachaneasy]] in [[Galloway]]
* [[Hessilhead]] in North Ayrshire
* [[Bloak]] in East Ayrshire
* [[Loch Brown|Ladeside]] in East Ayrshire
* [[Drummore|Damnaglaur]] in the Rinns of Galloway

In Canada:
* Clachan, Ontario, Canada

'''Clitoroplasty''' is the surgical creation of a [[clitoris]] in [[Trans woman|transgender women]] (as part of [[sex reassignment surgery (male-to-female)|sex reassignment surgery]]), or restoration in the case of procedures reversing the damage caused by [[female genital cutting]].

Women and girls with [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] may also undergo this to correct clitoral size in accordance to the female anatomy or complications of the condition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119580794/abstract Clitoroplasty in Intersex: a New Technique] 1998 British Journal of Urology, 1981 original publication&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clitoroplasty in sex reassignment surgery==
As part of reassignment surgery for trans women, there are several ways to create a clitoris from existing [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]. The most common method in practice is to separate the [[Human penis|penile]] [[Glans penis|glans]] from the paired erectile tissues, and reduce in size to simulate that of a [[cissexual| cisgender woman's]] clitoris.

The success rate for the creation of a clitoris for trans women greatly varies. The most common cause of failure is the [[necrosis]] of the tissue from lack of blood supply. The greatest non-lethal health risk is damage to the ''[[pudendal nerve]]s'' that greatly reduces the chances and intensity of orgasms when severed.

Most trans women's bodies readily accept the relocation of glans penile tissue in the area of a cissexual woman's clitoris. Dr [[Suporn Watanyusakul]] uses a modified technique that preserves some erectile tissue to simulate clitoral engorgement and a small amount of [[foreskin]] to act as a [[clitoral hood]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

An alternative technique involved the use of urethral spongiform as a clitoral mound. This allowed for better simulation of female [[Sexual arousal|sexual response]] at the cost of the clitoris being not as sensate as one derived from the glans penis. [[Urine]] leakage was a notable complication with this technique.&lt;ref&gt;Fang, Rong-Hwang; Chen, Cheng-Feng; Ma, Shiuh [http://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/1992/04000/A_New_Method_for_Clitoroplasty_in_Male_to_Female.15.aspx "A New Method for Clitoroplasty in Male-to-Female Sex Reassignment Surgery"], ''Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery'', April 1992, volume '''89''', issue 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Older genital reassignment techniques made no attempt at the creation of a clitoris at all. The glans of the penis was sutured in the most distal (inner) area of the [[neovagina]] to simulate a [[cervix]]. The late [[Stanley Biber]] preferred this method.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Largely unrecognised by modern courts, [[concubinage]] – the formal position of a mistress maintaining a religiously-sanctioned partnership with a man to whom she is not wed – has a varied history when it has appeared in Canada.

The term "concubine" has many definitions, referring to any illicit lasting relationship with an unmarried woman, or an "unmarried wife", or an extra-marital partner to a married man. Much of the political debate has tried to first define the term being used, followed by the legal arguments setting out its place in society.

==History==
In [[New France]], the institution of common-law or informal unions between French men and aboriginal women (known as ''[[Marriage 'à la façon du pays'|marriages according to the ways of the land]]'') had an ambiguous legal status. The practice was generally regarded by colonial authorities and the Church as a form of concubinage.

==Individual cases==
Often the issue of concubinage has appeared in [[insurance law]], when the mistress of an apparent [[extramarital affair]] has laid claim, typically as a [[Common-law marriage|commonlaw spouse]], to the estate of a man who has a legally-wedded wife, or no wife at all.&lt;ref&gt;Canada Department of Insurance, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=NDfBS_yNIcT7lweLsIjdBA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=6JHPAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq Report of the Superintendent of Insurance of the Dominion of Canada], 1943. p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monogamous concubinage==

Concubines in Canada were traditionally native women who were not believed suitable to become full wives to the European settlers. [[Molly Brant|Elizabeth "Molly" Brant]], the sister of the famed native chief [[Joseph Brant]] is believed to have served as the concubine to [[Sir William Johnson]];&lt;ref&gt;"Review of Historical Publications Relating to Canada", Volumes 3-4. 1899. page 82&lt;/ref&gt; although his sexual promiscuity was widely known.

{{quote|At such a place, surrounded by such influences and such unfavorable circumstances, if Mr. Connolly...desired...to take this Indian maiden to his home, he had one of three courses to pursue; that was, to marry her according to the customs and usages of the Cree Indians - to travel with her between three and four thousand miles, in canoes and on foot, to have his marriage solemnized by a priest or magistrate - or to make her his concubine. I think the evidence...will clearly show which of these three courses he did adopt, and which of them...he honorably and religiously followed.|Connolly vs. Woolrich and Johnson et al, 1867&lt;ref&gt;The Lower Canada Jurist, Volume 11. 1867. Page 225.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In July 1867, controversy broke out over the case of Connolly v. Woolrych, wherein a Canadian working for the [[North West Company]] had taken a 15-year-old native wife and lived with her for 28 years, before leaving her to partake in a traditional Christian marriage ceremony with his cousin, Miss Woolrich, with whom he lived another 17 years. After the death of Connolly and his "concubine" Suzanne, one her many children sued for the right to his estate claiming that the second marriage was invalid and seeking to "vindicate his mother's name from the stain of concubinage", while his proper wife argued that he had never been married to Suzanne.&lt;ref name="KIRBY"&gt;Kirby, James. "[https://archive.org/stream/canadalawjourna01unkngoog/canadalawjourna01unkngoog_djvu.txt The Canada Law Journal]", Volume 3, 1867&lt;/ref&gt;

The court noted that Suzanne and Connolly had omitted the traditional words "legitimate marriage" from the baptism of their children by Fr. Turcotte, instead asking him just to refer to their parenthood, but not to any marriage.&lt;ref name="KIRBY"/&gt; The court ultimately found that the territory in which he lived with Suzanne had been under native self-rule and therefore not bound to English law and proper registration of marriage would not have been necessary to establish a marriage, but that the native tribes had no marriage ceremonies, and the couple appeared to have "lived exactly as Christian man and wife, and not as a Christian living with a barbarian concubine", making pointed reference to the fact that Suzanne had entered a [[convent]] after Connolly's "act of selfish cruelty" in abandoning their relationship, and was subsequently sent regular stipends for support by Connolly and his wife.&lt;ref name="KIRBY"/&gt;

Under the [[Revised Statutes of British Columbia]], it was legal under the Administration Act, Cap. 5 for a resident of [[British Columbia]] to "support his concubine".&lt;ref&gt;Law Society of British Columbia, "The British Columbia Reports: Being Reports of Cases", 1946. Volume 61. Page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Canadian military forbade enlisted members from marrying during their service in [[World War I]], individual cases like that of Sgt. W. H. Sharpe roused public sentiment. Sharpe had listed Alma Freed as his wife when he enlisted, yet a year later in 1916 held a marriage ceremony with her after she gave birth to a son. He successfully argued, with the aid of PC 2615, that he had only been regularizing the status of his "unmarried wife".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Robert Craig. "Canada and the First World War: Essays in Honour of Robert Craig Brown", p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, [[Member of Parliament]] [[Rodolphe Lemieux]] tried to remove the portion of the Pension Bill that allowed the pension board "to grant a pension to a woman living with a man as his wife, but not married to him".&lt;ref&gt;[[Montreal Gazette]], "Unmarried Wife Clause Stays", July 2, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concubine in addition to wife==
In the lead-up to the codification of the 1866 [[Civil Code of Lower Canada]], [[Member of Parliament]] O'Farrell noted the inconsistency that would allow a man to leave his estate to a "common concubine" to the exclusion of his wife, but not to a charitable organisation in the same circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;Parliament of Canada, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=JDjBS5-eLIOKlwea1fDZBA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=u-QKAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq Debates of the Legislative Assembly of United Canada], p. 2537-2538&lt;/ref&gt; The draft which was finally approved was "torturous and detailed, emphasizing the sharp contradiction between freedom and morals", and allowed bequests only to provide such as was necessary to "maintain" a concubine and any "incestuous or adulterine children".&lt;ref&gt;Young, Brian J. "The politics of codification", page 139&lt;/ref&gt; The Code also made it clear that [[no fault divorce]]s were not permissible, and allowed separation only if the husband demanded it based on his wife's adultery, or that "a wife may demand the separation on the ground of the husband's adultery, if he keep his concubine in their common habitation".&lt;ref&gt;Parliament of Canada, Official Report of Debates, 1888&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Economic anthropology|Related articles}}
{{more footnotes|date=July 2010}}
The '''culture of poverty''' is a concept in [[social theory]] that asserts that the values of people experiencing poverty play a significant role in perpetuating their impoverished condition, sustaining a [[cycle of poverty]] across generations.  It attracted academic and policy attention in the 1970s, received academic criticism ({{harvnb|Goode|Eames|1996}}; {{harvnb|Bourgois|2001}}; {{harvnb|Small|Harding|Lamont|2010}}), and made a comeback at the beginning of the 21st century.{{sfn|Cohen|2010}} It offers one way to explain why poverty exists despite anti-poverty programs. Critics of the early culture of poverty arguments insist that explanations of poverty must analyze how structural factors interact with and condition individual characteristics ({{harvnb|Goode|Eames|1996}}; {{harvnb|Bourgois|2001}}; {{harvnb|Small|Harding|Lamont|2010}}). As put by {{harvtxt|Small|Harding|Lamont|2010}}, "since human action is both constrained and enabled by the meaning people give to their actions, these dynamics should become central to our understanding of the production and reproduction of poverty and social inequality."

== Early formulations ==
Early proponents of the theory argued that the poor are not only lacking resources but also acquire a poverty-perpetuating [[value system]]. According to anthropologist [[Oscar Lewis]], "The subculture [of the poor] develops mechanisms that tend to perpetuate it, especially because of what happens to the worldview, aspirations, and character of the children who grow up in it". {{harv|Lewis|1969|p=199}}

Some later scholars ({{harvnb|Young|2004}}; {{harvnb|Newman|1999}}; {{harvnb|Edin|Kefalas|2005}}; {{harvnb|Dohan|2003}}; {{harvnb|Hayes|2003}}; {{harvnb|Carter|2005}}; {{harvnb|Waller|2002}}; {{harvnb|Duneier|1992}}) contend that the poor do not have different values.

The term "subculture of poverty" (later shortened to "culture of poverty") made its first appearance in Lewis's ethnography ''Five Families: Mexican Case Studies in the Culture of Poverty'' [[#CITEREFLewis1959|(1959)]]. Lewis struggled to render "the poor" as legitimate subjects whose lives were transformed by [[poverty]]. He argued that although the burdens of poverty were systemic and so imposed upon these members of society, they led to the formation of an autonomous subculture as children were socialized into behaviors and attitudes that perpetuated their inability to escape the [[underclass]].

Lewis gave 70 characteristics ([[#CITEREFLewis1996|1996 [1966]]], [[#CITEREFLewis1998|1998]]) that indicated the presence of the culture of poverty, which he argued was not shared among all of the lower classes.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;
The people in the culture of poverty have a strong feeling of marginality, of helplessness, of dependency, of not belonging. They are like aliens in their own country, convinced that the existing institutions do not serve their interests and needs. Along with this feeling of powerlessness is a widespread feeling of inferiority, of personal unworthiness. This is true of the slum dwellers of [[Mexico City]], who do not constitute a distinct ethnic or [[race (human classification)|racial group]] and do not suffer from racial discrimination. In the [[United States]] the culture of poverty that exists in the black community has the additional disadvantage of perceived [[racial discrimination]].

People with a culture of poverty have very little sense of history. They are a marginal people who know only their own troubles, their own local conditions, their own neighborhood, their own way of life. Usually, they have neither the knowledge, the vision nor the [[ideology]] to see the similarities between their problems and those of others like themselves elsewhere in the world. In other words, they are not [[class conscious]], although they are very sensitive indeed to status distinctions. When the poor become class conscious or members of trade union organizations, or when they adopt an internationalist outlook on the world they are, in my view, no longer part of the culture of poverty although they may still be desperately poor.
&lt;/cite&gt; {{harv|Lewis|1998}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Lewis was concerned with poverty in the developing world, the culture of poverty concept proved attractive to US public policy makers and politicians. It strongly informed documents such as the [[Moynihan Report]] (1965) as well as the [[War on Poverty]], more generally.

The culture of poverty also emerges as a key concept in [[Michael Harrington]]'s discussion of American poverty in ''[[The Other America]]'' ([[#CITEREFHarrington1962|1962]]). For Harrington, the culture of poverty is a structural concept defined by social institutions of exclusion that create and perpetuate the cycle of poverty in America.

== Reactions ==
Since the 1960s, critics of culture of poverty explanations for the persistence of the underclasses have attempted to show that real world data do not fit Lewis's model {{harv|Goode|Eames|1996}}. In 1974, anthropologist Carol Stack issued a critique of it, calling it "fatalistic" and noticing the way that believing in the idea of a culture of poverty does not describe the poor so much as it serves the interests of the rich.

She writes, citing Hylan Lewis another critics of Oscar Lewis' Culture of Poverty:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The culture of poverty, as Hylan Lewis points out, has a fundamental political nature.  The ideas matters most to political and scientific groups attempting to rationalize why some Americans have failed to make it in American society. It is, Lewis (1971) argues, 'an idea that people believe, want to believe, and perhaps need to believe.' They want to believe that raising the income of the poor would not change their life styles or values, but merely funnel greater sums of money into bottomless, self-destructing pits. This fatalistic view has wide acceptance among scholars, welfare planners, and the voting public. Indeed, even at the most prestigious university, the country's theories alleging racial inferiority have become increasingly prevalent. 
{{sfn|Stack|1974}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, she demonstrates the way that political interests to keep the wages of the poor low create a climate in which it is politically convenient to buy into the idea of culture of poverty {{harv|Stack|1974}}. In sociology and anthropology, the concept created a backlash, pushing scholars to look to structures rather than "[[blaming-the-victim]]" {{harv|Bourgois|2001}}.

Since the late 1990s, the culture of poverty has witnessed a resurgence in the social sciences, but most scholars now reject the notion of a monolithic and unchanging culture of poverty. Newer research typically rejects the idea that whether people are poor can be explained by their values. It is often reluctant to divide explanations into "structural" and "cultural," because of the increasingly questionable utility of this old distinction.{{sfn|Small|Harding|Lamont|2010}}

'''Daniel Andreas San Diego''' (born February 9, 1978) is an American [[domestic terrorist]] who is listed on the [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists]] list.

__TOC__

==Background==
San Diego was born in 1978 in [[Berkeley, California]] and grew up in [[San Rafael, California]]. He attended [[Terra Linda High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/sanfrancisco/press-releases/2009/sf042109.htm |title=Marin Man Added to FBI’s ‘Most Wanted Terrorists’ List |author=FBI San Francisco|accessdate=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took classes at [[College of Marin]] and worked at [[San Rafael High School|San Rafael High School's]] [[high school radio|radio]] station, [[KSRH]], listening to [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[rock music]]. As a young man he gave up [[drugs]], [[alcohol]], [[meat]], and [[milk products]], taking an interest in the [[straight edge]] movement and becoming [[vegan]].&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Fox News|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,424762,00.html|title=Wanted: Daniel Andreas San Diego for Eco-Terror Bombings|author=Joseph Abrams|date=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mostwanted" /&gt;

At the time of the bombings he lived in Schellville, California, a small community outside of [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]], where he worked as a computer specialist.&lt;ref name=sfg&gt;{{cite news|title=Alleged bomber added to FBI terror list|author=Henry K. Lee|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2009-04-21|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/04/21/BABH176A4V.DTL&amp;tsp=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8466234|title=FBI's newest 'Most Wanted' terrorist is American|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225190125/https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8466234|archivedate=December 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His landlord described him as "very nice and personable," mentioned his claim to be starting a new business venture of vegan [[marshmallows]] made without [[gelatin]], and said that he had never given the impression of holding [[Political radicalism|radical]] views on [[animal rights]]. The [[FBI]] claims this was all an act.&lt;ref name="mostwanted" /&gt;

San Diego is described as having ties to Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC) as a well-known [[San Francisco Bay Area]] animal rights activist. SHAC is an international campaign set up to close down Europe's largest animal testing laboratory, [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]], a company that performs drug and chemical [[animal experiments|research experiments on animals]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/5217035/Animal-rights-activist-added-to-FBIs-most-wanted-terrorist-list.html|title=Animal rights activist added to FBI's most wanted terrorist list|author=Leonard Doyle in Washington|date=24 April 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the related bombings SHAC targeted HLS customer Chiron and its employees with a series of actions, accusing them of being "puppy killers."&lt;ref name="fox" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

==Animal Liberation Brigade==
On August 28, 2003, two sophisticated homemade bombs exploded approximately one hour apart, at the [[Chiron Corporation]] in [[Emeryville, California]], causing minor property damage but no injuries.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;&lt;ref name=sfg2&gt;{{cite news|title=2 bombs shatter biotech firm's windows|author=Stacy Finz|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2003-08-29|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/08/29/MN173487.DTL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI believes the second bomb was timed to target first responders.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6771993|publisher=ABC 7 News|date=2009-04-21|title='Most Wanted' terrorist from Bay Area|author=Eric Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another bomb, wrapped with nails to produce shrapnel, exploded on September 26, 2003 at the [[Shaklee Corporation]] in [[Pleasanton, California]], again causing damage but no casualties.&lt;ref name="FBI Most Wanted Poster" /&gt; The bombs used [[ammonium nitrate]] explosives and mechanical timers.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/04/21/fbi.domestic.terror.suspect/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=April 21, 2009|title=Animal rights activist on FBI's 'Most Wanted Terrorists' list|author=Terry Frieden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group called the [[Revolutionary Cells – Animal Liberation Brigade]] claimed responsibility via an email message after each bombing.&lt;ref name="AP article" /&gt; FBI agents admit that they cannot prove San Diego has ties to the emails, but believe he has ties to the group that sent them.&lt;ref name="mostwanted" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI Most Wanted Poster"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorists/tersandiego_da.htm |title=FBI — DANIEL ANDREAS SAN DIEGO |work=FBI |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919043042/http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorists/tersandiego_da.htm |archivedate=2010-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bombing targets were chosen because they were both clients of Huntingdon Life Sciences.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

==Disappearance==
The agency had San Diego under 24-hour surveillance in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_12185373|title=Marin County animal rights extremist added to the FBI's 'Most Wanted Terrorists' list|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered that he was being watched and on October 6, 2003 parked his car in downtown [[San Francisco]], California, walked away, and never returned.&lt;ref name="mostwanted" /&gt;

==Most Wanted==
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2014}}

San Diego was profiled on America's Most Wanted six times after his disappearance. In April 2009, he became the first domestic terrorism suspect to be added to the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists List. At one point, the FBI believed he was in the [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] area.

In February 2014, as part of the FBI’s National Digital Billboard Initiative, San Diego’s photo, summary of crimes, and the tip line 1-800-CALL-FBI will be featured on electronic billboards throughout California, as well as along the U.S.-Canada border in New York and Washington State. Billboards in Massachusetts, Oregon, Nevada, and Florida will also feature the San Diego case.{{update after|2014|8}}

In early 2014, the FBI announced that they had "credible intelligence" that San Diego might be on [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii's Big Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/12/daniel-andreas-san-diego-hawaii_n_4953184.html |title=Daniel Andreas San Diego, The FBI's Most Wanted Domestic Terror Suspect, May Be In Hawaii |first=Paul|last=Elias |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reward of up to $250,000 USD is available for information that leads to the arrest of San Diego.

===Peoples considered as natives=== &lt;!--linked from [[Equatorial Guinea]]--&gt;
The majority of the people of Equatorial Guinea are of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] origin. The largest ethnic group, the [[Fang people|Fang]], are indigenous to the mainland, but substantial migration to [[Bioko Island]] has resulted in Fang dominance over the earlier Bubi inhabitants. The Fang constitute 80% of the population and are themselves divided into 67 clans. Those in the northern part of Rio Muni speak Fang-Ntumu, while those in the south speak Fang-Okah; the two dialects are [[mutually unintelligible]]. The [[Bubi people|Bubi]], who constitute 15% of the population, are indigenous to Bioko Island.

In addition, there are coastal ethnic groups, collectively referred to as ''Ndowe'' or "Playeros" ("''Beach People''" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]): [[Combe people|Combes]], [[Bujeba people|Bujebas]], [[Balengue people|Balengues]] and [[Benga people|Bengas]] on the mainland and small islands and a [[Fernandinos|Fernandino]] community of [[Sierra Leone Krio people|Krio]] descended people on Bioko. Together, these groups compose 5% of the population.

Two small groups of [[Pygmy peoples|Pygmies]] also inhabit the country, the [[Beyele]] and the [[Bokuign]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.guinea-ecuatorial.info/historia.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914023759/http://www.guinea-ecuatorial.info/historia.html |archive-date=2011-09-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the former being located in the [[Altos de Nsork National Park|Altos de Nsork]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observatoire-comifac.net/docs/edf2006/EN/State_of_the_Forest_2006-03.pdf Monte Alén-Monts de Cristal Landscape: Ethnic groups].

=== Recently immigrated peoples ===
Some Europeans (largely of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] or [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] descent) – among them mixed with African ethnicity – also live in the nation. Most Spaniards left after independence.There is a growing number of foreigners from neighboring [[Cameroon]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Gabon]]. Equatorial Guinea received [[Asians]] and black Africans from other countries as workers on [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coffee]] plantations.In the late 20th century, Equatorial Guinea became home to more than 80,000 Hispanics from Mexico, Central America, and other Spanish speaking nations in the Americas.Other black Africans came from [[Liberia]], [[Angola]], and [[Mozambique]], and Asians are mostly [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] with small numbers of [[India]]ns. Equatorial Guinea also allowed many fortune-seeking European settlers of other nationalities, including [[British people|British]], [[French people|French]] and [[Germans]]. After independence, thousands of Equatorial Guineans went to Spain. Another 100,000 Equatorial Guineans went to Cameroon, Gabon, and Nigeria because of dictatorship of [[Francisco Macías Nguema]]. Some of its communities also live in [[Brazil]], [[United States]], Portugal, and [[France]].

== Languages ==
[[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] are the [[official language]]s and spoken as second languages. Spanish is the language of education, and for this reason a majority of the population (about 88%) can speak it, though only about 10–15% have a high competence in the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/anuario/anuario_06-07/pdf/paises_08.pdf Gloria Nistal Rosique: El caso del español en Guinea Ecuatorial] (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; Annobonese speak a [[Portuguese Creole]], named [[Annobonese language|Annobonese]], as their first language. Asian migrants and descendants of Europeans settlers (mostly [[Spaniards]], [[Britons]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]) usually speak their ancestral languages along with Spanish. Non-Equatorial Africans usually speak their native languages and their nation's official languages – English and [[Igbo language|Igbo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Equatorial Guinea : Overview |publisher=[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] |date=20 May 2008 |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,MRGI,,GNQ,,4954ce2a2,0.html |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Africa 2012 |first=James Tyler |last=Dickovick |publisher=Stryker Post |year=2012|isbn= 1-61048-882-2 |page=180 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdyYjQxd7uEC&amp;pg=PA180 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Nigerians]]; English for [[Demographics of Cameroon|Cameroonians]] and [[Demographics of Liberia|Liberians]]; French for [[Demographics of Cameroon|Cameroonians]] and [[Languages of Gabon|Gabonese]]; and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for [[Angola]]ns and [[Demographics of Mozambique|Mozambicans]]. The latter was made an official language since July 13, 2007. 82% of first foreign language learners choose the French language and 18% the [[English language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://asp.zone-secure.net/v2/index.jsp?id=7259%2F9906%2F54502 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111111/http://asp.zone-secure.net/v2/index.jsp?id=7259%2F9906%2F54502 |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has greatly influenced both religion and education.

===Languages of traditional names===
Equatoguineans tend to have both a Spanish first name and an African first and last name. When written, the Spanish and African first names are followed by the father's first name (which becomes the principal surname) and the mother's first name. Thus people may have up to four names, with a different surname for each generation.

==History==

In the Pre-soviet era Commissariats for Invalid Welfare were responsible for services for disabled people. Welfare co-operatives, mutual aid societies and charitable societies were also involved. Between 1929 to 1932 it was estimated that the disabled population  was made up of 43% war veterans, 32% industrially injured and the remainder through accidents and disability at birth. In March 1921 775000 wooden arms and legs for disabled soldiers had been produced. In 1926 there were estimated to be 15 blind persons per 10,000 population.  There were up to 21000 disabled people in homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khwaja|first1=Barbara|title=Health Reform in Revolutionary Russia|url=https://www.sochealth.co.uk/2017/05/26/health-reform-revolutionary-russia/|accessdate=26 May 2017|publisher=Socialist Health Association|date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Ernest Hartman''' (August 25, 1964 &amp;ndash; October 3, 2003) was convicted of the 1993 murder of Herman Smith, Sr. and was executed via lethal injection in 2003 by the State of [[North Carolina]] at Central Prison in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. 

Hartman confessed to the crime but requested a [[Life imprisonment|life sentence]].  According to ''[[The News &amp; Observer]]'', five [[mitigating factor]]s were presented at Hartman's trial, including [[alcoholism]] (he claimed to be severely intoxicated at the time of the murder) and [[child abuse|childhood abuse]].  The jury felt that these factors were outweighed by Hartman's theft of Smith's car and money.  In seeking [[clemency]], Hartman's lawyers (along with outside groups) argued that the prosecution had used Hartman's sexuality (he was bisexual) in a discriminatory manner, an argument rejected by the courts and by Governor [[Mike Easley]] of North Carolina.

{{Essay|date=February 2015}}
{{Green politics sidebar}}
'''Green theory''' in [[international relations]] is a sub-field of [[international relations theory]] which concerns international environmental cooperation (Eckersley 2010).

==Liberal institutionalism==
The majority of scholarly literature in international relations approaches environmental problems from a liberal institutionalist perspective focusing on international environmental regimes.
There is a relationship between Globalization and Environment which is among the forces behind the birth of green theory. However a unified theory is missed.
Controversy of the human species as world managers where "conservation" is "right use" of nature and "preservation" is "right non-use" of nature and humanity as protecting nature against itself with little allowance for ecological dynamics is part of the cause for some "essentially contested concepts" where even "sustainable development" is sometimes contested.

The "collective action problem" is central to cooperation.  It is discussed by Michael Laver (1997) in "Private Desires, Political Action" with examples of "The Prisoner's dilemma" and the "Tragedy of the commons."  The disconnect between individual goals and group goals suggests a role for leadership and more than simple management.  Green theory has championed consensus decision making as best it can be done.  Empowering the disempowered is also a strand in Green theory.

Interactions are important to Green theory.  From Stephen W. Littlejohn's (1983) book "Theories of Human Communication" (2nd ed.) we find a discussion of macronetworks with members and links.  The five properties of links are: (1) symmetry (how much who relates to who or how equal the communication is); (2) strength (how often who relates to who); (3) reciprocity (agreement between members of links); (4) content (what the area or context of communication is); and, (5) mode (what the means or context of communication is).  [Littlejohn is actually referring to Richard V. Farace, Peter R. Monge, and Hamish Russell from "Communicating and Organizing" (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1977)]  Network communication is a bridge to appreciating the interdependence of ecosystems.

"International Regimes" is a classic IR work edited by Stephen D. Krasner (1983) which discusses emergent norms in complex (international) systems.  International regimes are deemed to be a collective solution to problems of turbulence and unpredictability.  On the micro level, Marshall Rosenberg's "Nonviolent Communication" (2nd ed., 2003) suggests people must agree on the description of the situation, agree on the stakeholders' feelings, agree on the stakeholders' needs, and then agree on the stakeholders' requests in order for healthy negotiation to be possible.  In veridical conflict, when it occurs, there may not be a mutually satisfactory resolution possible.

==Green IPE==
This field studies the impact of IPE (international political economy) and it has been widely accepted as an area within IR theory. The strongest protesters of such irregular emigration movements are the ecofeminists who tend to gather once a month to hold non-peaceful and noisy demonstrations. 

J. K. Galbraith said in "The Age of Uncertainty" that economics entails understanding the relationship of people with land.  Green theory uses case studies of people living on land to better understand economy. Later, the idea of "[[ecological footprint]]" developed.

Green leaders use suasion, persuasion, exemplification and all the techniques of public relations and propaganda to shift the publics' tastes towards green decisions both in markets and in other areas where decisions, goals, or choices are being made.  As Fraser P. Seitel (1989) in "The Practice of Public Relations" says there are many "publics" and many choices.  Places or contexts of choices matter too.  Green theory rewrites the rules for consumers.  David R. Boyd &amp; David T. Suzuki's (2008) "Green guide" comes to mind.  

The public as workers is critical to Green theory.  The greening of the labour market, workplace, and industry is important.  One wonders, as democracy is valued in Green theory, what the appropriate attitude towards "economic democracy" would be.  Robert A. Dahl (1985) in his "A Preface to Economic Democracy" argues weakly in favour of workplace democracy.  If the factors of production are land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship, it is unclear how these can be democratically related and what kind of property rights might survive.  

Joseph Heath (2009), in "Filthy Lucre," describes "capitalism" as a "nexus of relationships" (as between suppliers, producers, consumers, marketers, regulators, for example).  Green theory is complex in its management of policy networks.  The New Age idea of "segmented, polycentric, integrated networks" (SPINs) suggests a possible complex replacement for capitalism.  In public administration the idea of "governance" systems addresses some of the complexity.  

Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's idea of "noosphere" as a connection and link thick environment where multilateral group, system, organization, and network interrelations can instantiate human wisdom is also possible for Green theory.  

"Globalization" is commonly understood to involve cross-border flows.  This can be transportation of material or people, transmission of information or ideas, transfer of capital or ownership, transactions altering status, transmissions of disease and disease causing organisms, trade in goods and services, transfers of technology or industrial arts and products, and may be considered a stage of "modernization" and/or "development."  Global flows are to be monitored and controlled through many local actions.  For this 'globalization' to work, local decisions must successfully restrict the perverse effects of global flows.  A margin for error must be maintained. 

Free trade appears to be focused upon free markets.  Yet, even Raymond Vernon (1977) in "Storm Over the Multinationals" suggests that a multinational corporation could serve as a non-tariff barrier to free trade.  You could go further and suggest that concentrations of purchasing power and control over property rights might serve to restrict "free trade" even if we do not wish to have the total equality of no concentrations of wealth.  Free markets are not free if those who have wealth can control flows and restrictions as well as the litigation over disputes.  

Control over energy and power, likewise, serves to replace the slave trade.  "Nature" is never clearly enough defined.  Natural resources and natural flows of energy and nutrients are neither entirely free nor entirely artificial.  No one, apparently, wants total energy entropy (insofar as it can be delayed).  It seems that a mixed economy may be best suited to the "natural" as complete rational planning and complete free markets are no friends to nature.  This assumption is, of course, quite contestable.

==Normative and cosmopolitan==
One aspect of Green IR theory is normative theorising such as [[bioregionalism]].  The idea of a "land ethic" and the belief that people can "think globally and act locally" have given hope that norms can be directly or indirectly derived from nature.  

Futurology and counterfactual reasoning, such as that promoted by Philip E. Tetlock &amp; Aaron Belkin (1996) in "Counterfactual Thought Experiments in World Politics," may just as easily produce dystopias as utopias.  Environmental security, while still questionable, is at least more basic than human security.  Likewise, "ecology" (the study of households or habitats) has priority over "economics" (the applied laws of households or habitats).  

The fit between people and their environments brings up the topic of positive and negative eugenics which has been a background challenge in Green theory.  Healthy and unhealthy have seemed to replace the theology of good and evil.  Holistic health is a popular part of green theories combined with green living. Public health with prevention and health promotion are more consistent with Green theory too.  

The non-violent thread in Green theory has led to an anti-hierarchical standard which can seem to be anarchical in this theory.  Eco-feminists may hold anti-hierarchical views.  Living wages and more equality may be emphasized.  Ernest Callenbach's "Ecotopia" seems to almost be a matriarchal totalitarianism. The choices and liberties can be shifted in Green theory.  

Turn taking among Green leaders means sometimes the responsibilities of power and sometimes being the follower.  All this within groups attempting consensus with group skills added to communication skills which can be overpowering.

A behavioural space with contingencies, classical and operant conditioning, plus systems of semiotic systems with underlying structures, even for individual cells, organisms, groups, and all conceivable units of analysis could certainly be overpowering.  It would seem to be a case of Michel Foucault's "governmentality" where both individuals and populations are simultaneously controlled.  And the governmentality would grow and evolve.  

Growth of any particular species can be in numbers, qualities, adaptations (fitting in), and adjustments (changes to environment) which makes for complex practical syllogisms.  As Thomas Szasz said in "Ideology and Insanity": "stars move, machines function, animals behave, and people conduct themselves."  It is an idea of "ecopsychology" that contact with nature promotes mental health and wellness.  

According to Morris Berman there is a "Shadow Side of Systems" from the Journal of Humanistic Psychology (Winter 1996).  Just as democracy can make for a tyranny of the majority so can systems thinking provide for authoritarianism and/or paternalism.  A case study of Green theorists' dealing with the issue of "abortion" can illustrate this matter.  Life and choice are both important to Green theorists.  Disconnecting the conception decision from the birth decision can have eugenic consequences.  Perhaps females could take charge of reproductive technology but then they would be in charge of eugenics too.  

The compromises of living where you like and liking where you live; of doing what you like and liking what you do; and, of having the child you like and liking the child you have -- these do not make choices easier.  Do we love the people we love and love the people we love -- both?  Green theory does not always distinguish public space from private space. As for political ideologies and Green theory, Timothy O'Riordan (1990) in "Major Projects and the Environment" in Geographical Journal, indicates there to be "dry greens" (perhaps conservative and market centered), "shallow greens" (perhaps liberal and sustainable development centered), and "deep greens" (perhaps radical and ecosystem or earth centered).  This, of course, may be an oversimplification.  "Dry Greens" may be the least appreciated environmentalists and might not even be given that title.  However, a very good economic treatment is given in "The Plundered Planet" by Paul Collier (2010).  Collier may put the plight of the bottom billion (poorest and worst off people) on the planet above environmentalism.  He believes protecting the viability of the planet and the bottom billion must both be done.  Green theorists, of course, emphasize equality such that the bottom billion are equal to the top billion.  How that works out is  challenging.  If the planet does need a billion fewer people, then there is no agreed upon way of choosing.  Market solution would include rising food prices and only those with ability to pay survive.  Each culture, religion, and academic discipline has developed and produced different solutions to the "Who survives?" conundrum.

==Security Studies==
Green IR approaches have challenged traditional approaches to security in international relations. This has included the concept of [[environmental security]] which has  involved the  '[[securitization]]' of environmental threats.  

While Green theory embraces non-violence and condemns the toxicity of much military materials, civilian defence and protest have long been used as tactics.  Appropriate technology, even for military use, is becoming more preferred.  Green theorists may dispense with much strategic security planning as letting the laws of nature take their course.  

John H. Storer in "The Web of Life" (1953, 1956, pp.&amp;nbsp;76 – 77), mentions some of the laws of nature as: adaptation, succession, multiplication, and, control, such that a species occupies a niche with a carrying capacity and limiting factors.  This is the long view of strategy.  Strategy is assumed to be phylogenetic and tactics more ontogenetic (as may be morals and ethics respectively).  Families and nations may be similar and different.  "The Advent of Netwar" by John Arquilla &amp; David Ronfeldt (RAND, 1996) suggests that fractal thinking may highlight fractal warfare.  Swords and spears, the tools of regular warfare, may be changed to plows and pruning-hooks, the tools of eugenic management.  

As for the short view, private security or acting locally may be of interest. Harvey Burstein (1994) in "Introduction to Security" gives five items that security staff must control: crime, waste, accidents, errors, and unethical practices.  Such is the short view of tactics—albeit from an environmental perspective.  Even the best "securitization" cannot eliminate error.  The items that security controls also have their carrying capacities and limiting factors.  Control may interact with higher level controls and counter-controls like a flow chart.  

Agenda 21, that optimistic document for the beginning of the Twenty-first Century, seeks to control all accidents so that human beings can live in safety.  It failed, but it can provide a guide for those who think globally and act locally.  The move from human centered to ecosystem centered thinking and feeling may, ironically, be an improvement to humanity.

An area of challenge to all IR theories is secrecy and surveillance along with control of information.  Monitoring is necessary for protection and control (security) but sometimes secrecy is necessary too.  Realism, capitalism, and socialism could not handle secrecy well and it remains to be seen whether Green theory's handling of secrecy could not create worse disasters.  Transparency and democracy may not be appropriate political technologies for all decisions.

Further discussion of power, secrecy vs. espionage, persuasion vs. evaluation, and information control is in "Policing Politics: Security Intelligence and the Liberal Democratic State" by Peter Gill (1994).  Citizen policing of politics goes with empowering the disempowered and consensus.  Perhaps "subsidiarity" may be needed with a secret "black box" at the appropriate level of decision making which is always the lowest possible.

It would be a good exercise in Green Theory to consider Derrick Jensen's "Twenty Premises" from his books "Endgame: Volumes I &amp; II" (2006) with "Agenda 21" and its efforts to control humanity and the environment to produce security.  Is a graceful transition from the present world to a greener future world possible?  How possible?

A critical point in the history of Green Theory is 1992 when, of course, the Rio Conference happened.  Also Biodiversity and Global Warming became more important.  Emphasis may have moved from local ecosystems to the global ecosystem.  One book published at this time in which the author seeks perhaps to rescue Greens from themselves and provide a revisionist Green policy is "Green Political Theory" by Robert E. Goodin (1992).  It was a timely criticism.  He compares a capitalist theory of value based upon consumer satisfaction; a socialist theory of value based upon labour; and, a Green theory of value based upon natural resources.  

He also discusses the weakness for international organization of a highly decentralized political system.  Perhaps in answer, "Leaders lead; but none too much," might provide a solution to Michel's 'iron law of oligarchy' where leaders can do job rotation with teaching environmental education, group decision-making, policy-making, as well as with other leaders, taking turns with administrative and diplomatic tasks.  Much leaders make for much participation and many types of participation.  Therefore diversity is increased.  

Goodin (1992) also discusses norms or values by focusing on "goods" and "the good" as well as "agency" which is more in the direction of "the right." Such a critical analysis of Green Theory at what is also a critical point in history is invaluable.

An obvious modern point about environment and security is distribution of risk and even global flows of risk.  If the rich are not to be protected too much, then it also might follow that the poor are not to be protected too much as well.  Proper balance is not the mere matter of comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable.  Ulrich Beck and others have written on the "risk society" which seems to enter into the discussions both of economy and security.  Subsidiarity may include levels of government which share authority, for example, national government, religious or organizational government, family government, and individual government.  There would not seem to be a monopoly over use of force.  There may be a tendency for eco-anarchism here.  

Just as we may use computer software to determine such things as financial crime and corruption, we might also use actuarial tables to determine unjust distribution of risk.  We would have to find ways to prevent "fait accompli" acts of the powerful to the less powerful.  This goes far beyond environmental impact statements or even studies.  It is a whole fabric with the socio-economic structures.

Solving the problem of a gentle transition to a green future can be difficult.  Between Derrick Jensen's "Endgame 1 &amp; 2" and Donald R. Liddick's (2006) "Eco-Terrorism", it can seem like opposite sides must be taken.  Liddick's book was published by Praeger Publishers which may have a reputation as being influenced by Intelligence agencies.  Of course, there is not necessarily anything wrong with patriotism and good intelligence writing is often better than standard academic publishing.  "Eco-Terrorism" could, however, be a bit of a propaganda piece.  It might knock down weak forms of green arguments to establish those arguments of a more capitalist nature supporting free markets and corporations.  Praeger Publishers may also have published "Crimes Against Nature" also by Donald R. Liddick (2011) and "The Rise of the Anti-Corporate Movement" by Evan Osborne (2007).  If Green theorists are to take consensus decision-making quite seriously, then bringing the environmental skeptics on board to the gentle transition becomes very important to a Green future.  

The question of whether (national) government alone must have a monopoly over the legitimate use of force has been contested for some time.  Should national government also have a monopoly of the use of fear, violence, and terror and would this ever be legitimate?  Can dissent, protest, and civil disobedience and holding the viewpoint of subversion of the current system be justified?  Is the "right to rebel" really an euphemism for the "right to revolt"?  It seems one other book: "Crime Wars: The Global Intersection of Crime, Political Violence, and International Law" by Paul Battersby, Joseph M. Siracusa, and Sasho Ripiloski (2011) might be worth reading.  But, books like "Folks, this ain't normal" by Joel Salatin (2011) and "Green is the New Red" by Will Potter (2011) may also be worth reading.  

Green theorists sometimes shift the meanings of "rights" and "freedoms" but a book to be published this year by Praeger Publishers about "Eco-psychology" (in two volumes) by Darlyne G. Nemeth, Robert B. Hamilton, and Judy Kuriansky, according to their catalogue would seem to shift some of the standard Green vocabulary.  Even "eco-terrorism" is a use of a label with often pejorative connotations.  It seems there is a battle going on over the future of Green discourse.  We may have to rethink definitions for "genocide" and "ecocide" with both broad and narrow definitions for each and how much powers and authorities whether those of people and families, organizations (religious or otherwise), governments (at all levels), or businesses can be criminalized and especially where and how prevention can best be practiced. The Encyclopedia of Earth website is apparently neutral and non-controversial.  Green theory has many essentially contested concepts.  Encyclopedia of Earth may also be in the process of updating its ideas of biosecurity and bioterrorism.  Antonio Gramsci's ideas of "war of manoeuvre" (real war in physical space) and "war of position" (war of words or what in Michel Foucault's terms could be a discussion and shaping of a discourse space) are pertinent to what is currently happening.  John Stuart Mill's "On Liberty" applies to discourse rather well for a standard 'liberal' approach which, itself, is not neutral.  It is supposed that Green thinkers clearly realize that much discussion need not lead to consensus and there can still remain veridical conflicts.  Whether the 'soft energy path' and a 'steady state economy' can actually be made to work require further theory and practice too.  The making of a fait accompli by mass ecocide or mass genocide (whether these be sudden or gradual) can hopefully be avoided.

'''Hoa Hakananai'a''' is a ''[[moai]]'' ([[Easter Island]] statue) housed in the [[British Museum]] in London. It was removed from ‘[[Orongo]], [[Rapa Nui]] (Easter Island) in November 1868 by the crew of the British ship {{HMS|Topaze|1858|6}},{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2006|p=37}} and arrived in England in August 1869.{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2006|p=3}} Though relatively small, it is considered to be typical of the island’s statue form,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Routledge|first1=K|title=The Mystery of Easter Island|date=1919|publisher=Sifton, Praed &amp; Co|location=London|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2004|pp=45–47}} but distinguished by [[carvings]] added to the back, associated with the island birdman cult.{{sfn|Van Tilburg|1992|pp=56–59}} It has been described as a "masterpiece"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Métraux|first1=A|title=The Ethnology of Easter Island|date=1940|publisher=Bernice P. Bishop Museum|location=Honolulu|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "without a doubt, the finest example of Easter Island sculpture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Métraux|first1=A|title=Easter Island: A Stone-Age Civilisation of the Pacific|date=1957|publisher=Andre Deutsch|location=London|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The statue was identified as Hoa Hakananai'a by islanders at the time it was removed, the British crew first recording the name in the form Hoa-haka-nana-ia or Hoa-haka-nama-ia.{{sfn|Van Tilburg|1992|p=41}} It has been variously translated from the Rapa Nui language ([[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]]) to mean ''breaking wave'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Routledge|first1=K|title=The Mystery of Easter Island|date=1919|publisher=Sifton, Praed &amp; Co|location=London|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''surfriding'',{{sfn|Van Tilburg|1992|p=41}} ''surfing fellow''{{sfn|Davletshin|2012|pp=62–63}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davletshin|first1=A|title=Images, which are not seen, and stolen friends, who steal: A reply to Van Tilburg and Arévalo Pakarati|journal=Rapa Nui Journal|date=2012|volume=26|issue=1|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''master wave-breaker'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RapaNui Sprache - Übersetzung Buchstabe N|url=http://www.osterinsel.de/35-rapanui-sprache-n.htm|website=Osterinsel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''lost or stolen friend'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoa Hakananai'a ('lost or stolen friend') / Moai (ancestor figure)|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=512302&amp;partId=1|website=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''stolen friend'' or ''hidden friend''{{sfn|Van Tilburg|1992|pp=41–42}} or ''doing robberies/mockeries friend''.{{sfn|Davletshin|2012|pp=62–63}}

== Provenance ==

When recorded in 1868, Hoa Hakananai'a was standing erect, part buried inside a freestone ceremonial "house" in the ‘[[Orongo]] village at the south-western tip of the island. It faced towards an extinct volcanic crater known as [[Rano Kau]], with its back turned to the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Routledge|first1=K|title=Survey of the village and carved rocks of Orongo, Easter Island, by the Mana Expedition|journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|date=1920|volume=50|pages=425–45|doi=10.2307/2843492}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Van Tilburg|1992|p=47}} It may have been made for this location, or first erected elsewhere before being moved to where it was found.{{sfn|Van Tilburg|1992|p=47}}{{sfn|Pitts|Miles|Pagi|Earl|2014|pp=7–10}}

== Description ==

Most statues on [[Rapa Nui]] are of a reddish tuff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Tilburg|first1=J|title=Easter Island: Archaeology, Ecology and Culture|date=1994|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2004|p=45}} but Hoa Hakananai'a is made from a block of dark grey-brown flow [[lava]].{{sfn|Pitts|Miles|Pagi|Earl|2014|p=3}} Though commonly described as [[basalt]], quarried near to where the statue was found,{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2004|p=45}} there is no record of petrological analysis to confirm this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Tilburg|first1=J|last2=Pakarati|first2=C|title=Hoa Hakananai’a in detail: comment on A. Davletshin’s unconvincing assertion of an "overlooked image" on the ventral side of the ‘Orongo statue now in the British Museum|journal=Rapa Nui Journal|date=2012|volume=26|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pitts|Miles|Pagi|Earl|2014|p=6}} It stands {{convert|2.42|m|ft|abbr=off}} high, is {{convert|96|cm|ft|abbr=on}} across, and weighs 4.2 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoa Hakananai'a ('lost or stolen friend') / Moai (ancestor figure)|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=512302&amp;partId=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The base of the statue, now concealed in a modern plinth, may originally have been flat, and subsequently narrowed, or was rough and tapering from the start.{{sfn|Van Tilburg|1992|pp=48–50}}{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2006|p=17}}{{sfn|Pitts|Miles|Pagi|Earl|2014|pp=6–7}}

Typical of Easter Island ''[[moai]]'', Hoa Hakananai'a features a heavy brow, blocky face with prominent nose and jutting chin, nipples, thin, lightly angled arms down the sides and hands reaching towards the stomach, which is near the base. It has a raised Y-shape in the centre of the chin, eyes hollowed out in a way characteristic of statues erected elsewhere on the island on ceremonial [[Easter Island#Stone platforms|''ahu'' platforms]], and long, rectangular stylised ears. A line around the base of the neck is interpreted as representing the clavicles;{{sfn|Van Tilburg|1992|pp=48–50}}{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2006|p=17}}{{sfn|Pitts|Miles|Pagi|Earl|2014|pp=6–7}} there is a semi-circular hollow for the suprasternal notch.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In its original form, the back is thought to have been plain, apart from a ''maro'', a belt or girdle, which consists of three raised lines and a circle above, and an M on a vertical line below. Near the base are slight indications of buttocks.{{sfn|Pitts|Miles|Pagi|Earl|2014|pp=6–7}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The top of the head is smooth and flat,{{sfn|Pitts|Miles|Pagi|Earl|2014|p=6}} and could originally have supported a ''[[pukao]]'', a cylindrical stone "hat". A flat round stone found near the site of the statue may have been such a hat,{{sfn|Pitts|Miles|Pagi|Earl|2014|p=23}} or, if the base was flat, a bed plate on which the statue once stood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Routledge|first1=K|title=Survey of the village and carved rocks of 'Orongo, Easter Island, by the Mana Expedition|journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|date=1920|volume=50|page=436|doi=10.2307/2843492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Date ==

No Easter Island statues have been scientifically dated, but statue making in general is said to have begun by at least 1000 CE,{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2004|p=39}} and occurred mostly between 1300 and 1500 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=S|title=The Island at the End of the World|date=2005|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacture is said to have ended by 1600 CE, when islanders began to topple them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoa Hakananai'a Easter Island statue|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/qV6Cpj1ITza54IbC7uij6Q|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Episode 70 of the 2010 [[BBC Radio 4]] series [[A History of the World in 100 Objects]] describes the statue as being from 1000-1200 CE.

The Y on the chin and the clavicles are rare on Easter Island statues, and said to be late innovations.{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2004|p=47}}

== Carvings ==

The back of the statue, between the ''maro'' and the top of the head, is covered with relief carvings added at an unknown time after the statue was made.{{sfn|Van Tilburg|1992|pp=56–59}}{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2006|p=38–40}}{{sfn|Pitts|Miles|Pagi|Earl|2014|pp=11–19}} They are similar in style to [[petroglyphs]] on the native rock around the ‘Orongo village, where they are more common than anywhere else on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=G|title=Rock Art of Easter Island: Symbols of Power, Prayers to the Gods|date=1992|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, University of California|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horley|first1=P|last2=Lee|first2=G|title=Painted and carved house embellishments at ‘Orongo village, Easter Island|journal=Rapa Nui Journal|date=2009|volume=23|issue=2|pages=106–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Either side and above the ring on the ''maro'' are two facing birdmen (''[[tangata manu]]''), stylised human figures with beaked heads said to represent frigate birds. Above these, in the centre of the statue’s head, is a smaller bird said to be a [[sooty tern]] (''[[manutara]]''). Either side of this is a ceremonial dance paddle (''ao''), a symbol of male power and prestige. Along the edge of the left ear is a third paddle, because of its smaller size possibly a ''rapa'' rather than an ''ao'', and on the right ear a row of four vulva symbols (''komari''). Y-shaped lines drop down from the top of the head.{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2004|pp=50–51}}{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2006|p=38}}

When first seen by Europeans, the carvings were painted red against a white background. The paint was totally or mostly washed off when the statue was rafted out to HMS ''Topaze''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horley|first1=P|last2=Lee|first2=G|title=Rock art of the sacred precinct at Mata Ngarau, ‘Orongo|journal=Rapa Nui Journal|date=2008|volume=22|issue=2|pages=112–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pitts|2014|pp=39–48}}

Precise reading of these designs varies. The birdmen are popularly interpreted as [[Makemake (mythology)|Makemake]], a fertility god and chief god of the birdman cult.{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2004|p=22}} This cult, said to have replaced the older statue cult, was recorded by early European visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Routledge|first1=K|title=The bird cult of Easter Island|journal=Folk-Lore|date=1917|volume=28|pages=335–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It involved an annual competition to retrieve the first egg laid by migrating sooty terns. The contest was held at ‘Orongo, and the winning man became Makemake’s representative for the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flenley|first1=J|last2=Bahn|first2=P|title=The Enigmas of Easter Island|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=175–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2004|p=23–25}} The last ceremony is thought to have been held in 1866 or 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Routledge|first1=K|title=The Mystery of Easter Island|date=1919|publisher=Sifton, Praed &amp; Co|location=London|pages=265–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New studies ==

After the most intensive survey of the statue to date, a more detailed interpretation of the carvings has been proposed.{{sfn|Pitts|Miles|Pagi|Earl|2014|pp=1–31}} The new survey, which followed an as yet unpublished [[3D scanner|laser scan survey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Tilburg|first1=J|title=Hoa Hakananai’a laser scan project|url=http://www.eisp.org/10}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprised a combination of [[Photogrammetry]] and [[Reflectance Transformation Imaging]], used to create high-resolution digital images in “two and a half” and three dimensions.{{sfn|Miles|Pitts|Pagi|Earl|2014|pp=596–605}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pitts|first1=M|last2=Miles|first2=J|last3=Pagi|first3=H|last4=Earl|first4=G|title=Taking flight: the story of Hoa Hakananai’a|journal=British Archaeology|date=2013|volume=130|pages=24–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pitts|first1=M|title=Last night in the Wellcome Gallery|url=http://mikepitts.wordpress.com/2012/02/16/last-night-in-the-wellcome-gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This allowed several details to be clarified. The Y-shaped lines at the top of the head are the remnants of two large ''komari'', partly removed by the other carvings, which were added at a later date. The small bird has a closed beak, not open as had often been described, and the foot of the left birdman has five toes, not six. There is a small, shallow carving below the left ear, which could be a ''komari'' or the head of an ''ao''. The beak of the right birdman comes to a short, rounded end, not a long pointed tip; the latter reading of the digital models was supported by a new interpretation of a photo of the statue taken in 1868.{{sfn|Pitts|2014|pp=39–48}}

The archaeologists behind the new digital study also proposed a new way to read the main composition. It was suggested that the elements worked together to portray the birdman ceremony, with the left birdman figure male, the right female (two of the four “egg gods”), and the bird above them their new-hatched fledgling. “Meanwhile the entire statue has become Makemake, its face painted white… in the manner of the human birdman”.{{sfn|Pitts|Miles|Pagi|Earl|2014|pp=26–28}} One group of critics described this interpretation as “interesting, thought provoking and even somewhat poetic”, but, while “greatly impressed by the work”, rejected the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=G|last2=Horley|first2=P|last3=Bahn|first3=P|title=Comments on historical images of the moai Hoa Hakananai’a|journal=Rapa Nui Journal|date=2014|volume=28|pages=53–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent history ==

Hoa Hakananai'a was found in November 1868 by officers and crew from the British Royal Navy ship {{HMS|Topaze|1858|6}}.{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2006|pp=26–37}} When first seen, it was buried up to about half its height or even more.{{sfn|Pitts|Miles|Pagi|Earl|2014|p=23}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=G|last2=Horley|first2=P|last3=Bahn|first3=P|title=Comments on historical images of the moai Hoa Hakananai’a|journal=Rapa Nui Journal|date=2014|volume=28|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horley|first1=P|last2=Lee|first2=G|title=Rock art of the sacred precinct at Mata Ngarau, ‘Orongo|journal=Rapa Nui Journal|date=2008|volume=22|issue=2|pages=113–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was dug out, dragged down from Rano Kau on a sledge, and rafted out to the ship.{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2006|p=37}}

It was photographed while HMS ''Topaze'' was docked in Valparaiso, Chile, from back{{sfn|Pitts|2014|pp=39–48}} and front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=G|last2=Horley|first2=P|last3=Bahn|first3=P|title=Comments on historical images of the moai Hoa Hakananai’a|journal=Rapa Nui Journal|date=2014|volume=28|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time Commodore Richard Ashmore Powell&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=512302&amp;partId=1&lt;/ref&gt;, captain of the ''Topaze'', wrote to the British Admiralty offering the statue as a gift.{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2006|p=3}}

HMS ''Topaze'' arrived in [[Plymouth]], England, on 16 August 1869. The Admiralty offered the statue to [[Queen Victoria]], who proposed that it should be given to the British Museum.{{sfn|Van Tilburg|2006|p=3}} It was mounted in a plinth and exhibited outside the museum’s front entrance, beneath the portico. During the Second World War, it was taken inside, where it mostly remained until 1966. In that year it was moved to the museum’s then Department of Ethnography, which had separate premises in Burlington Gardens. It returned to the British Museum site in 2000, when it was exhibited on a new, higher plinth in the Great Court, before moving to its present location in the Wellcome Trust Gallery (Room 24: Living and Dying).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=D|title=The British Museum: A History|date=2002|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Van Tilburg|1992|p=4–5}} It has been suggested that the statue was originally erected at a slightly different angle, so that the top of the head would have been exactly horizontal.{{sfn|Pitts|Miles|Pagi|Earl|2014|pp=10–11}}

== In popular culture ==

* Hoa Hakananai'a has inspired artists, among them [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=D|title=The British Museum: A History|date=2002|publisher=British Museum|location=London|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henry Moore]], who was filmed talking about the statue in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wyver|first1=J|title=Lost encounter|date=2013|url=http://www.illuminationsmedia.co.uk/2013/09/lost-encounter/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore commented on its “tremendous presence”, and that its makers “knew instinctively that a sculpture designed for the open air had to be big”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=H|last2=Finn|first2=D|title=Henry Moore at the British Museum|date=1981|publisher=British Museum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Ron Mueck]] exhibited his Mask II in front of Hoa Hakananai'a in 2008/09.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ron Mueck|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/museum_in_london/london_exhibition_archive/statuephilia/ron_mueck.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The English artist Ronald Lampitt used it as a model for an illustration of Easter Island for ''Look and Learn'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ronald Lampitt Archive|url=http://www.illustrationartgallery.com/acatalog/info_LampittEasterIsLL.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A set of six postage stamps issued by the [[Royal Mail]] in 2003 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the British Museum featured Hoa Hakananai'a alongside other Museum objects such as the [[Sutton Hoo helmet]] and a mask of [[Xiuhtecuhtli]].{{sfn|CollectGBStamps}}{{sfn|Daily Mail|2003}}

* It was selected by British Museum director Neil MacGregor as one of the 100 objects with which he told the history of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacGregor|first1=N|title=A History of the World in 100 Objects|date=2010|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|pages=449–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoa Hakananai'a Easter Island statue|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/qV6Cpj1ITza54IbC7uij6Q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
The Rapa Nui people consider the statue to be stolen.  In November of 2018 Tarita Alarcon Rapu, the Governor of Easter Island, asked the British Museum to return the statue.  The Rapa Nui people have recently gained administration over their ancestral lands on Easter Island. The museum agreed to discuss the statue with representatives of the Rapa Nui people &lt;ref&gt;http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/easter-island-begs-british-museum-for-statue-return/ar-BBPUSHI?ocid=iehp&lt;/ref&gt;. The museum does not list the statue as a gift in its digital archives, it is recorded as a collected artifact&lt;ref&gt;https://britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=512302&amp;partId=1&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''John Ruffo''' (born November 24, 1954) is an American former [[business executive]], [[White-collar crime|white-collar criminal]] and [[confidence trick|confidence man]], who in 1998 was convicted in a scheme to defraud many US and foreign banking institutions of over 350 million dollars. The swindle is considered one of the most significant cases of [[bank fraud]] in US history.&lt;ref name="WANTED - John Ruffo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmarshals.gov/investigations/most_wanted/ruffo/ruffo15.htm|title=WANTED -   John Ruffo|work=usmarshals.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a [[fugitive]] from justice ever since, and is on the [[U.S. Marshals 15 Most Wanted Fugitives]] list.&lt;ref name=NPR1/&gt;

He was the President of CCS, an [[IBM]] equipment reseller in New York City, in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Kenneth N.

==Early life and education==
Ruffo was born to a close-knit [[Italian American]] family in a [[working class]] neighborhood in Brooklyn. He attended [[New York University]] on a scholarship, earning a degree in [[computer science]]. In May 1980, he married his childhood sweetheart, Linda. Ruffo initially worked for United Computer Systems LLC in New York, before eventually branching out to form his own firm, Consolidated Computer Services (CCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Signed, Sealed and Stolen|url=http://xfinitytv.comcast.net/watch/American-Greed%3A-The-Fugitives/5745045945648593112/53737027506/Signed%2C-Sealed-%26-Stolen-Miami-Medi-%24cam/videos|accessdate=29 August 2015|agency=Docs|publisher=CNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal activity, arrest and conviction==
Ruffo became acquainted with and befriended another prominent New York businessman, Edward J. Reiners, formerly an executive with [[Phillip Morris USA]]. After Reiners was laid off, he approached Ruffo with an idea in 1992. The scheme involved soliciting various banks in an attempt to secure financing for a fictitious "Project Star". They pitched the project to bank executives as a top secret operation for Phillip Morris to develop smokeless cigarettes. Ruffo's company, CCS, was to provide the [[computer hardware]] and consulting for five offices set up to work on the project. They leveraged Reiners' prior credentials as a Phillip Morris executive to forge documents and add authenticity to the scheme. They also included stringent [[confidentiality agreements]] stipulating that because of the sensitivity of the project, banks were to deal only with Reiners and to never contact Phillip Morris directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-Employee of Philip Morris Pleads Guilty to Bank Fraud|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/06/business/ex-employee-of-philip-morris-pleads-guilty-to-bank-fraud.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruffo tried to avoid suspicion by making timely [[Interest|interest payments]] on the loans. However, in 1996 a bank executive at the [[Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan]] noticed an irregularity on one of the forged documents. After he contacted Phillip Morris and then the [[FBI]], the scheme began to unravel. Reiners was arrested by FBI agents who set up a [[sting operation]] on March 19 of 1996, and an [[arrest warrant]] was issued for Ruffo two weeks later. All told the scheme generated over $350 million in secured loans, though much of it was squandered in poor [[Wall Street|stock market]] speculation and exorbitant spending habits on the part of the conspirators.  $21 million, however, was never accounted for by federal authorities.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
Ruffo faced a 150-count indictment charging him with bank fraud, [[money laundering]], [[wire fraud]], and [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]].  His bail was set at an unusually high $10 million as he was considered a [[fugitive|flight]] risk.  As nearly all of Ruffo's known assets and accounts were frozen by the FBI, most of his immediate family put up their homes as collateral to secure his pre-trial release. Ruffo was found guilty on all counts and was sentenced to 17 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Male, rich and smart?

[[File:Ruffo1.png|thumb|Ruffo Surveillance Image]]

In November 1998, Ruffo failed to turn himself over to the U.S. Marshals Service to begin serving his sentence. His image was captured on [[CCTV]] cameras taking money out of an ATM (pictured) on the afternoon he was to report, but he has not been seen nor heard from since. In his wife's last communication with him on the morning of his disappearance, he told her he was meeting with a parole officer but never returned. His car was later recovered by the FBI abandoned at [[JFK Airport]].Three months after Ruffo's disappearance, the homes of his wife, mother, mother-in-law, and others were seized by the government as a forfeiture of bond collateral, effectively making them all homeless.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/john-ruffo-elusive-nyc-swindler-still-run-after-20-years-n934741&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities believe Ruffo still has access to substantial [[offshore bank|overseas financial resources]], which could be aiding him in his ability to stay [[off-the-grid]] and assume a new [[Identity document forgery|identity]]. Chief Deputy US Marshall John Bolen commented in 2013, "Having been sentenced to 220 months of incarceration and not serving a single day of that kind of sticks in the craw of those of us in this profession. His actions are a mockery to our justice system. We are the best in the world at this. He just has to make one mistake. We can make many but he just has to make one. We'll catch him". In 2007, Ruffo's last attorney, Jeffery Lichtman, offered the following when asked if he thought authorities would ever capture his former client: "I think if I had to be a betting man, I'd put my money on John Ruffo. Because from what I can see so far, he is smarter than the people looking for him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6ea63xC2AQC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20ruffo%20fugitive|title=Con Men: Fascinating Profiles of Swindlers and Rogues from the Files of the Most Successful Broadcast in Television History|last=Minutes|first=60|date=2007-11-01|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781416593195|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruffo remains at large. The U.S. Marshals Service is offering a $25,000 reward for information that leads to the capture of John Ruffo.&lt;ref name="WANTED - John Ruffo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Signed, Sealed, and Stolen|url=http://xfinitytv.comcast.net/watch/American-Greed%3A-The-Fugitives/5745045945648593112/53737027506/Signed%2C-Sealed-%26-Stolen-Miami-Medi-%24cam/videos|accessdate=29 August 2015|agency=CNBC|publisher=CNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Money to Run, But No Skills to Hide|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104362181|website=NPR|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kele people''' (or Lokele) are a Bantu ethnic group of about 160,000 people, in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].
They mainly live on the south bank of the Congo River between [[Kisangani]] and [[Isangi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Drum language==

The Kele were known for their drum language, described by the English missionary [[John F. Carrington]], who spent his life in Africa.
His findings were published in his 1949 book ''The Talking Drums of Africa''.
The Kele people used drum language for rapid communication between villages. Each village had an expert drummer, 
and all villagers could understand the drum language.
Carrington studied the drum language at a time when it was already falling out of use, and today it is extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Kosovo refugees in Albania''' refers to the mostly [[ethnic Albanians]] of [[Kosovo]] (at the time part of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]) fleeing the [[Kosovo War]] into neighboring [[Albania]] in 1999. This crisis was exceptional at the time, as a movement of population this big in such a short period of time was unseen since [[World War II|WWII]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iacopino|first=Vincent|last2=Franck|first2=Martina|last3=Bauer|first3=Heidi|last4=Keller|first4=Allen|last5=Fink|first5=Sheri|last6=Ford|first6=Doug|last7=Pallin|first7=Daniel|last8=Waldman|first8=Ronald|date=2001|title=A Population-Based Assessment of Human Rights Abuses Committed Against Ethnic Albanian Refugees From Kosovo|pmc=1446925|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=91 |issue=12|pages=2013–2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the ones going to Albania, a large number of Kosovo refugees fled to [[Former Yugoslav Republic Of Macedonia|The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kondaj|first=Ruki|date=2002|title=Management of Refugee Crisis in Albania during the 1999 Kosovo Conflict|url=http://neuron.mefst.hr/docs/CMJ/issues/2002/43/2/11885046.pdf|journal=Croatian Medical Journal|volume=43|pages=190–194|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all of the remaining 500,000 to 600,000&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; individuals in Kosovo were also displaced in the region itself, without leaving it.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Refugee crisis, from March to June 1999 ==
In March 1999, the [[NATO]] started a military air strike in Kosovo, in the name of an "Humanitarian War".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Adam|date=1999|title=NATO's ‘Humanitarian War’ over Kosovo|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00396339912331342943|journal=Survival|volume=41:3|pages=102–123|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to many Albanians fleeing from Kosovo to neighboring countries,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;UNHCR, Evaluation and Policy Analysis Unit (2000), The Kosovo refugee crisis, [http://www.unhcr.org/research/evalreports/3ba0bbeb4/kosovo-refugee-crisis-independent-evaluation-unhcrs-emergency-preparedness.html An Independent evaluation of UNHCR's emergency preparedness and response] retrieved 3. March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; mainly from March to June 1999.

Albania opened its borders from the beginning of the crisis in order to let refugees come.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|95}}&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; People were arriving directly at the border located at the north east of the country, or were transferred from Macedonia.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|95}} Albania was not prepared for so many people to come and asked for international help in order to cover refugees basic needs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To coordinate the operations, the Albanian government created the Emergency Management Group days after the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO military air strike]] began.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This group coordinated actions from main structures such as the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] and many other organisations such as NGOs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The situation was nevertheless delicate during the first days because [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] and NGOs did not predict that the [[NATO]] bombings would last for several months and lead to such a movement of population.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|95}} Equipment was at first lacking, but many international structures and NGO's raised funds and/or gave practical help to Albania.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Several European countries stated that it was in the interests of the refugees to stay in the region and gave financial help.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Germany, for example, gave money to build camps in Albania for refugees transferred from Macedonia.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|95}} On top of the refugees placed in camps, the Albanian population welcomed many of them in their homes,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; sharing space and food.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Almost 435,000 refugees had to leave Kosovo for Albania, according to the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Most of them arrived directly in Albania and some of them were transferred from Macedonia.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barutciski|first=Michael|last2=Suhrke|first2=Astri|date=2001|title=Lessons from the Kosovo Refugee Crisis: Innovations in Protection and Burden-sharing|url=https://academic.oup.com/jrs/article-abstract/14/2/95/1520113?redirectedFrom=PDF|journal=Journal of Refugee Studies|volume=14:2|issue=2|pages=95–134|doi=10.1093/jrs/14.2.95|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|95}} At the height of the [[Kosovo War]], refugees were crossing the border into [[Albania]] at the rate of 4,000 people per hour.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/307057.stm|title=Refugees flee Kosovo horror|last=|first=|date=March 30, 1999|work=BBC News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, the [[UNHCR]] stated that up to 25% of the population of Kosovo had fled.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

On June the 11th, 1999, the air campaign from the [[NATO]] stopped. The day before, a military technical agreement was signed by both parties and ended the armed conflict.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huysmans|first=Jef|date=2002|title=Shape-shifting NATO: humanitarian action and the Kosovo refugee crisis|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0260210502005995|journal=Review of International Studies|volume=28|pages=599–618|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] report written about the refugee crisis stated that it was well managed, regarding the circumstances.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== After the crisis - From June 1999 ==
In the peace treaty signed by the Nato and the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], it was asked that refugees could go back to their homes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most of the refugees were indeed able to go back to Kosovo during the same year, after the armed conflict ended.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;UNHCR (1999), Global Report, p.321, http://www.unhcr.org/3e2d4d50d.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
The [[NATO]] blamed the Federal Republic of [[Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and its leader [[Slobodan Milošević]] for the refugee crisis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Because of the instability in the region from 1998 already, the [[NATO]] did not separate the mass influx of refugee from 1998 to the end of the conflict in its statistics.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; According to several researchers, however, the mass influx started just after the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|95}}&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==History and origin==

The Lok Rajput claims to descent from a small number of [[Parmara|Panwar]] [[Rajput]]s that settled in the hill country near [[Mount Abu]]. Owing to their isolation from [[Rajput]] groups, they evolved into a distinct community.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Rajasthan Volume XXXVIII Part Two edited by B.K Lavania, D.

==Present circumstances==

The community is endogamous, and divided into fourteen exogamous [[gotra]]s. These gotras are involved in the regulating of marriages. They are a community of mainly small peasant farmers, with animal husbandry being their main secondly occupation.

'''Makara Sankranti''', also known as '''Makaraa Sankrānti''' ([[Sanskrit]]: मकर सङ्क्रान्ति) or '''Maghi''', is a festival day in the [[Hindu calendar]], in reference to deity [[Surya]] (sun). It is observed each year in January.&lt;ref name="Tumuluru2015p30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton2011p547"/&gt; It marks the first day of sun's transit into the [[Capricorn (astrology)|Makara (Capricorn)]], marking the end of the month with the [[winter solstice]] and the start of longer days.&lt;ref name="Tumuluru2015p30"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamal Kumar Tumuluru|title=Hindu Prayers, Gods and Festivals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2iyCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30 |year=2015|publisher=Partridge|isbn=978-1-4828-4707-9|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p411"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

''Makara Sankranti'' is one of the few ancient Indian festivals that has been observed according to solar cycles, while most festivals are set by the lunar cycle of the lunisolar [[Hindu calendar]].&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p411"/&gt; Being a festival that celebrates the solar cycle, it almost always falls on the same Gregorian date every year (January 14),&lt;ref name="Melton2011p547"/&gt; except in some years when the date shifts by a day for that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jain Chanchreek|author2=K.

Makara Sankranti is set by the solar cycle of the Hindu lunisolar calendar, and is observed on a day which usually falls on 14 January of Gregorian calendar, but sometimes 15 January.&lt;ref name="Tumuluru2015p30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton2011p547"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bhavana Nair|title=Our Leaders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2uBqRoRyqQC&amp;pg=PA65|year=1989|publisher=Orient Longman|isbn=978-81-7011-678-3|page=65}}, '''Quote:''' "One was at the famous Bageshwar fair held on Makar Sankranti day on the banks of Sarayu on January 15, 1921.";&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

Makar Sankranti falls in the [[Hindu calendar]] solar month of Makara, and lunar month of ''[[Magha (month)|Magha]]'' (the festival is also called Magha Sankranti or Magha festival in parts of India).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen Bellenir|title=Religious Holidays and Calendars: An Encyclopedic Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KDUOAQAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Omnigraphics|isbn=978-0-7808-0258-2|pages=140–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marks the end of the month with [[winter solstice]] for India and the longest night of the year, a month that is called Pausha in lunar calendar and Dhanu in the solar calendar in the Vikrami system. The festival celebrates the first month with consistently longer days.&lt;ref name="Tumuluru2015p30"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamal Kumar Tumuluru|title=Hindu Prayers, Gods and Festivals|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=b2iyCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30 |year=2015| publisher=Partridge|isbn= 978-1-4828-4707-9|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different systems to calculate the Makara Sankranti date: ''nirayana'' (without adjusting for precession of equinoxes, sidereal) and ''sayana'' (with adjustment, tropical). The January 14 date is based on the ''nirayana'' system, while the ''sayana'' system typically computes to about December 23, per most Siddhanta texts for [[Hindu calendars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Sewell|author2=Śaṅkara Bālakr̥shṇa Dīkshita|title=The Indian Calendar: With Tables for the Conversion of Hindu and Muhammadan Into A.D.

The festival is dedicated to the Hindu sun god, ''Surya''.&lt;ref name="Melton2011p547"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Gordon Melton|title=Religious Celebrations: An Encyclopedia of Holidays, Festivals, Solemn Observances, and Spiritual Commemorations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KDU30Ae4S4cC&amp;pg=PA547 |year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-205-0|pages=547–548}}, '''Quote:''' "Makara Sankranti (January 14); Makara Sankranti is a festival held across India, under a variety of names, to honor the god of the sun, Surya."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Beteille | first=Andre | title=A Note on the Pongal Festival in a Tanjore Village | journal=Man | volume=64 | year=1964 | doi=10.2307/2797924 | pages=73–75, see discussion of Makar Sankranti}}&lt;/ref&gt; This significance of Surya is traceable to the Vedic texts, particularly the [[Gayatri Mantra]], a sacred hymn of Hinduism found in its scripture named the ''[[Rigveda]]''. The festival also marks the beginning of a six months auspicious period for Hindus known as ''[[Uttarayana]]'' period.&lt;ref name="Melton2011p547"/&gt;

Makara Sankranti is regarded as important for spiritual practices and accordingly, people take a holy dip in rivers, especially Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri. The bathing is believed to result in merit or absolution of past sins. They also pray to the sun and thank for their successes and prosperity.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;Tumuluru, Kamal Kumar (2015), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b2iyCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31 Hindu Prayers, Gods and Festivals], Partridge Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; A shared cultural practices found amongst Hindus of various parts of India is making sticky, bound sweets particularly from sesame (''til'') and a sugar base such as jaggery (''gud, gur''). This type of sweet is a symbolism for being together in peace and joyfulness, despite the uniqueness and differences between individuals.&lt;ref name="Melton2011p547"/&gt; For most parts of India, this period is a part of early stages of the Rabi crop and agricultural cycle, where crops have been sown and the hard work in the fields is mostly over. The time thus signifies a period of socializing and families enjoying each other's company, taking care of the cattle, and celebrating around bonfires, in Maharashtra the festival is celebrated by flying kites.&lt;ref name="Melton2011p547"/&gt;

Makara Sankranti is an important pan-Indian solar festival, known by different names though observed on the same date, sometimes for multiple dates around the Makar Sankranti. It is known as Pedda Panduga in Andhra Pradesh, Makara Sankranti in Karnataka, Pongal in Tamil Nadu, [[Magh Bihu]] in Assam, Magha Mela in parts of central and north India, as Makar Sankranti in the west, and by other names.&lt;ref name="Melton2011p547"/&gt;

The day preceding Makara Sankranti is called Bhoghi (భోగి). This is when people discard old and derelict things and concentrate on new things causing change or transformation. At dawn, people light a bonfire&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; with logs of wood, other solid fuels and wooden furniture that are no longer useful.

;;Makara Sankranti(మకర సంక్రాంతి)
[[File:Pongal Pot.jpg|100px|thumb|Decorated Pot]]
The second day is Makara Sankranti. People wear new clothes, pray to God, and make offerings of traditional food to ancestors who have died. They also make beautiful and ornate drawings and patterns on the ground with chalk or flour, called "Rangoli" or "muggu" in Telugu, in front of their homes. These drawings are decorated with flowers, colours and small, hand-pressed piles of cow dung, called "gobbemma" (గొబ్బెమ్మ).

For this festival all families prepare Chekkalu, Chakralu, Arisalu, Booralu, Gavvalu, Poornalu, Boondi Mitai, Boondi Laddu, Garelu, Chakinalu, Nuvvula Appalu, Katte Appalu or karam appalu, Madugulu (Jantikalu), Bellam Appalu, kudumulu, Ariselu, Appalu (a sweet made of jaggery and rice flour) dappalam (a dish made with pumpkin and other vegetables) and make an offering to God.

On the third day, Kanuma (కనుమ) is celebrated. Kanuma is very intimate to the hearts of farmers because it is the day for praying and showcasing their cattle with honor. Cattle are the symbolic indication of prosperity. On the day after Makara Sankranti, the animal kingdom is remembered and, in particular, cows. Girls feed the animals, birds and fish as a symbol of sharing.

;;Mukkanuma 
The fourth day is called Mukkanuma (ముక్కనుమ) which is popular among the non-vegetarians of the society. On this day, farmers offer prayers to the elements (like soil, rain, fire for helping the harvest) and the (village) goddesses with their gifts which sometimes (and these days mainly) include animals. People in Andhra  and Telangana do not eat any meat (or fish) during the first three days of the festival and do so only on the day of Mukkanuma. Kanuma, Mukkanuma and the day following Mukkanuma call for celebrations with union of families, friends, relatives. People play with kites and the sky is filled with beautiful kites.

Another notable feature of the festival in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is the ''Haridasu'' and ''Gangiredduvallu" who go early in the morning with a colourfully dressed cow. Haridasus sing songs of Lord Vishnu (Hari); hence the name Haridasu (servant of Hari). It is a custom that he should not talk to anyone and only sing songs of Lord Vishnu when he goes to everyone's house.

===Bihar and Jharkhand===
[[File:Til gud Ladoo.png|thumb|A traditional sweet sesame-jaggery based ''ladoo'' exchanged and eaten on Makar Sankranti.]]
In [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]], the festival is celebrated on 14–15 January.

On 14 January, it is celebrated as Makar Sankranti or Sakraat or Khichdi (in local dialects). As in other parts of country, people take baths in rivers and ponds and feast upon seasonal delicacies as a celebration of good harvest. The delicacies include chura, gur (jaggery), sweets made of til (sesame seeds) such as tilgul, tilwa, maska, etc., curd, milk and seasonal vegetables. Kite flying festivals are organised, albeit on a small scale.

On 15 January, it is celebrated as Makraat (in some parts of the state) when people relish special [[khichdi]] (dal-rice replete with cauliflower, peas and potatoes).

The festival is one of the most important. People start their day by worshiping and putting til (sesame seeds) into fire followed by eating "dahi-chuda", a dish made of beaten rice (chuda or poha, in Hindi, or avalakki, in Kannada) served with a larger serving of dahi (curd), with cooked kohada (red pumpkin) that is prepared specially with sugar and salt but no water. The meal is generally accompanied by tilkut and lai ([[laddu]] made of til, chuda and rice). The festive meal is traditionally made by women in groups. Since the meal is heavy, lunch is generally skipped on the day and the time is, instead, spent on socializing and participating in kite flying festivals.

At night a special khichdi is made and served with its four traditional companions, "char yaar" (four friends) — chokha (roasted vegetable), [[papad]], [[ghee]] and [[achaar]]. Since such a rich khichdi is generally made on this festival, the festival is often colloquially referred to as "Khichdi".

===Delhi and Haryana===
Kayastha community which have been building blocks of Delhi today and Other neighbouring rural communities like Yadavs, Jats which mainly belong to Haryana and Punjab consider Sakraat or Sankranti to be a main festival of the year. Churma of ghee, halwa and kheer are cooked specially in Jats and Yadavs homes on this day. One brother of every married woman visits her home with a gift of some warm clothing for her and her husband's family. It is called "Sidha". Women used to give a gift to their in-laws, and this rituals called "Manana". The recipient will sit in a haweli (main palace where men sit together and share hookka). Women go to haweli to sing folk songs and give gifts.

===Goa===
Known as ''Sankrant'' in Goa and like in the rest of the country, people distribute sweets in the form of granules of sugar-coated till pulses among family members and friends, with the words,''Till gull gheiat, godd uloiat'', meaning ''Eat seasame and jaggery and sweeten your talk''.

12-day Haldi Kumkum festival begins on Makar Sankranti, married women celebrate the festival till [[Ratha Saptami]].Married women visit each other's homes where the women apply ''Halad''(turmeric) and [[Kumkum]] (vermilion) to the foreheads of other women and put flowers in their hair, and offer them household gifts.
Newly married women offer five sunghat or small clay pots with black beaded threads tied around them, to the deity. These pots are filled with newly harvested food grains and are offered with betel leaves and areca nut.&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.timesofindia.com/city/goa/Of-sesame-laddoos-and-prayers-for-husbands/articleshow/7288470.cms]&lt;/ref&gt; Its observance takes place on a rather subdued note, unlike major festivals of the region like [[Ganesh chaturthi]].

===Gujarat===
{{Main|International Kite Festival in Gujarat – Uttarayan}}
Uttarayan, as Makar Sankranti is called in Gujarati, is a major festival in the state of Gujarat&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gZRLGZNZEoEC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=uttarayan+gujarat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNjeaRup_RAhWlIsAKHSq6CAUQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=uttarayan%20gujarat&amp;f=false Desai, Anjali H. (2007) India Guide Gujarat. India Guide Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; which lasts for two days.

* 14 January is Uttarayan
* 15 January is Vasi-Uttarayan (Stale Uttarayan).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KUduAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Vasi-Uttarayan&amp;dq=Vasi-Uttarayan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI5e2Kv5_RAhUDAxoKHb9mDbEQ6AEIITAB Vyas, Rajnee (2006) Welcome to Gujarat.Akshara Prakashan]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gujarati people keenly await this festival to fly kites, called 'patang'. Kites for Uttarayan are made of special light-weight paper and bamboo and are mostly rhombus shaped with central spine and a single bow. The string often contains abrasives to cut down other people's kites.

In Gujarat, from December through to Makar Sankranti, people start enjoying Uttarayan. [[Undhiyu]] (spicy, baked mix of winter vegetables) and chikkis (made from til (sesame seeds), peanuts and jaggery) are the special festival recipes savoured on this day. The Hindu Sindhi community in western regions of India, that is also found in southeastern parts of Pakistan, celebrate Makar Sankranti as Tirmoori. On this day, parents sending sweet dishes to their daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Reejhsinghani, Aroona (2004) Essential Sindhi Cookbook. Penguin Books India [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ym9IWIZELc8C&amp;pg=PA14]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the major cities of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, and Jamnagar the skies appear filled with thousands upon thousands of kites as people enjoy two full days of Uttarayan on their terraces.

When people cut any kites they yell words like "kaypo chhe", "e lapet","jaay jaay","phirki vet phirki" and "lapet lapet" in Gujarati.

===Himachal Pradesh===
In Shimla District of Himachal Pradesh, Makar Sankranti is known as Magha Saaji. Saaji is the [[Himachali languages|Pahari]] word for Sakranti, start of the new month. Hence this day marks the start of the month of Magha.

According to Hindu religious texts, on the day of Uttarayani the sun enters the zodiac sign of Makara (Capricorn), i.e., from this day onwards the sun becomes 'Uttarayan' or it starts moving to the north. It is said that from this day, which signals a change of season, the migratory birds start returning to the hills. On Magha Saaja people wake up early in the morning and take ceremonial dips and shower in the [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] or [[baoli]]s. In the daytime people visit their neighbours and together enjoy [[khichdi]] with [[ghee]] and [[chaas]] and give it in charity at temples. Festival culminates with singing and Naati (folk dance).

===Karnataka(ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ )===
[[File:2017 Mysore 140.jpg|alt=Mysuru Decorated Cow. January 2017|thumb|Mysuru Decorated Cows. January 2017]]
This is the Suggi (ಸುಗ್ಗಿ) or harvest festival for farmers of Karnataka. On this auspicious day, girls wear new clothes to visit near and dear ones with a Sankranti offering in a plate and exchange the same with other families. This ritual is called "Ellu Birodhu." Here the plate would normally contain "Ellu" (white sesame seeds) mixed with fried groundnuts, neatly cut dry coconut and fine cut bella (jaggery). The mixture is called "Ellu-Bella" (ಎಳ್ಳು ಬೆಲ್ಲ). The plate contains shaped sugar candy moulds (Sakkare Acchu, ಸಕ್ಕರೆ ಅಚ್ಚು) with a piece of sugarcane. There is a saying in Kannada "ellu bella thindu olle maathadi" that translates to 'eat the mixture of sesame seeds and jaggery and speak only good.' This festival signifies the harvest of the season, since sugarcane is predominant in these parts. Ellu Bella, Ellu Unde, bananas, sugarcane, red berries, haldi and kumkum and small gift items useful in everyday lives are often exchanged among women in Karnataka.

[[File:Festive bites.jpg|thumb|left|Feast of Makar Sankranti]]
In some parts of Karnataka, a newly married woman is required to give away bananas for five years to married women (muthaidhe/sumangali) from the first year of her marriage and increase the number of bananas in multiples of five. There is also a tradition of some households giving away red berries "Yalchi Kai" with the above. In north Karnataka, kite flying with community members is a tradition. Drawing [[rangoli]] in groups is another popular event among women during Sankranti.

An important ritual is display of cows and bulls in colourful costumes in an open field. Cows are decorated for the occasion and taken on a procession. They are also made to cross a fire. This ritual is common in rural Karnataka and is called "Kichchu Haayisuvudu."

According to Indian religious texts, on the day of Uttarayani also called Ghughuti (घुघुति) in Kumaon, the sun enters the Zodiacal sign of 'Makara' (Capricon), i.e. from this day onwards the sun becomes 'Uttarayan' or it starts moving to the north. It is said that from this day, which signals a change of season, the migratory birds start returning to the hills. On Makar Sankranti people give Khichadi (a mixture of pulses and rice) in charity, take ceremonial dips in holy rivers, participate in the Uttarayani fairs and celebrate the festival of Ghughutia or Kale Kauva. During the festival of Kale Kauva (literal translation 'black crow') people make sweetmeats out of sweetened flour (flour and gur) deep fried in ghee, shape them in shapes such as drums, pomegranates, knives, and swords. These are fed to crows and other birds.

===Maharashtra===
[[File:Tilgul kha god god bola.jpg|thumb|Multicolored sugar halwa surrounded by til-gul (sesame and jaggery) ladoos. These exchanged and eaten on Makar Sankranti in Maharashtra]]
In Maharashtra on Makar Sankranti (मकर संक्रान्ति) day people exchange multicoloured halwa (sugar granules coated in sugar syrup) and ''til-gul laadoo'' (sweetmeats made from sesame seeds and jaggery). ''Gulachi poli/puran poli'' (गुळाची पोळी / पुरण पोळी) (flat bread stuffed with soft/shredded jaggery mixed with toasted, ground til [white sesame seeds]) and some gram flour, which has been toasted to golden in pure ghee, are offered for lunch. While exchanging ''til-gul'' as tokens of goodwill people greet each other with the words "तिळगुळ घ्या, आणि गोड-गोड बोला / til-gul ghyaa, aani goad-goad bolaa" meaning ‘Accept this ''til-gul'' (sweet) and utter sweet words’. The underlying thought in the exchange of ''til-gul'' is to forget the past ill-feelings and hostilities and resolve to speak sweetly and remain friends.

===Odisha===
The festival is known as Makar Sankranti in [[Odisha]]&lt;ref&gt;Goyal, Ashutosh  (2014) RBS Visitors Guide INDIA – Odisha: Odisha Travel Guide.

The withdrawing winter entails a change in food habits and intake of nourishing and rich food. Therefore, this festival holds traditional cultural significance. It is astronomically important for devotees who worship the sun god at the great Konark temple with fervour and enthusiasm as the sun starts its annual swing northwards.&lt;ref name="Bhubaneswar-MS"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Times News Network (TNN) |date=15 January 2014 |title=Makar Sankranti observed with pomp in state |newspaper=The Times of India |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Makar-Sankranti-observed-with-pomp-in-state/articleshow/28805682.cms? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115181106/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Makar-Sankranti-observed-with-pomp-in-state/articleshow/28805682.cms |archivedate=15 January 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to various Indian calendars, the Sun's movement changes and the days from this day onwards become lengthier and warmer and so the Sun-God is worshiped on this day as a great benefactor. Many individuals at the start of the day perform a ritual bath while fasting.&lt;ref name="Bhubaneswar-MS" /&gt; Makar Mela (Fun fair) is observed at Dhabaleswar in [[Cuttack]], Hatakeshwar at Atri in [[Khordha]], Makara Muni temple in [[Balasore]] and near deities in each district of Odisha.

They celebrate this festival with great enthusiasm, singing, dancing and generally having an enjoyable time. This Makara Sankranti celebration is next to the Odia traditional new year [[Maha Vishuva Sankranti]] which falls in mid April. Tribal groups celebrate with traditional dancing, eating their particular dishes sitting together, and by lighting bonfires.

It is the only Indian festival celebrated on a fixed day of the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Besides the usual rituals, people of Orissa, especially Western Orissa, reaffirm the strength of the bond of friendship with their best friends during this occasion. The practice is called ‘Makar Basma’.
After a man binds himself with one of his friends in the shackles of friendship during Makar Sankranti, afterwards he addresses the other as ‘Maharshad’ or ‘Marsad’; if two women tie the friendship lace on each other’s wrist, they call each other ‘Makara’. They don’t utter each other’s name. This goes on for one full year till the next Makar Sankranti. In Eastern Orissa, on many occasions, two friends feed each other ‘Mahaprasad’, the offering made in the famous Jagannath temple of Puri, and continue the friendship for at least one year. Orissa Post talks to some women about their experiences when they tied the friendship knot on Makar Sankranti.

===Punjab===
{{Main|Maghi}}
[[File:Kothe-da-mela.jpg|thumb|Mela]]

In [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], Makar Sankranti is celebrated as [[Maghi]] which is a religious and cultural festival. Bathing in a river in the early hours on [[Maghi]] is important. Hindus light lamps with sesame oil as this is supposed to give prosperity and drive away all sins. A major mela is held at [[Sri Muktsar Sahib]] on Maghi which commemorates a historical event in Sikh history.

Culturally, people dance their famous "[[Bhangra (dance)|bhangra]]". They then sit down and eat the sumptuous food that is specially prepared for the occasion. It is traditional to eat "kheer", rice cooked in milk and sugarcane juice. It is also traditional to consume [[khichdi]] and [[jaggery]]. December and January are the coldest months of the year in the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]. [[Maghi]] represents the change of the season to warmer temperatures and increase in daylight. Maghi fairs are held in many places.

People invite friends and relatives (specially their sisters and daughters) to their home for special festival meals (called as "Sankrant Bhoj"). People give out many kind of small gifts such as til-gud (jaggery), fruits, dry khichadi, etc. to Brahmins or the needy ones.

===Tamil Nadu===
{{Main|Thai Pongal}}
[[File:Pongal.jpg|thumb|The Tamil festival of Pongal coincides with Makar Sankranti, and celebrates ''Surya''.]]
It is a four-day festival in Tamil Nadu:
* Day 1: Bhogi Pandigai (போகி பண்டிகை)
* Day 2: Thai Pongal (தை பொங்கல்)
* Day 3: Maattu Pongal (மாட்டுப் பொங்கல்)
* Day 4: Kaanum Pongal (காணும் பொங்கல்)

The festival is celebrated four days from the last day of the Tamil month Maargazhi to the third day of the Tamil month Thai.

;Bhogi
The first day of festival is Bhogi (போகி). It is celebrated on the last day of Margazshi&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mg1WAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=is+bhogi+festival+separate+from+thai+pongal&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Bogi+Pandigai+ Eastern World, Volumes 4–5 1950]&lt;/ref&gt; by throwing away and destroying old clothes and materials, by setting them on fire, marking the end of the old and the emergence of the new. In villages there will be a simple ceremony of "Kappu Kattu" (kappu means secure) will be done. The 'neem' leaves are kept along the walls and roof of the houses. This is to eliminate evil forces.

;Thai Pongal
[[File:A Hindu girl in traditional dress for the Tamil Pongal festival.jpg|thumb|left|A Tamil Hindu girl in traditional dress for Pongal.]]
The second day of festival is [[Thai Pongal]] or simply Pongal. It is the main day of the festival, falling on the first day of the Tamil month Thai which starts with the solar cycle when sun starts moving through the summer solstice. It is celebrated by boiling rice with fresh milk and jaggery in new pots, which are later topped with brown sugar, cashew nuts and raisins early in the morning and allowing it to boil over the vessel. This tradition gives Pongal its name. The moment the rice boils over and bubbles out of the vessel, the tradition is to shout "பொங்கலோ பொங்கல் (Ponggalo Ponggal)!" and blow the sangu (a conch), a custom practised to announce it was going to be a year blessed with good tidings. Then new boiled rice is offered to the Sun god during sunrise, as a prayer which symbolises thanks to the sun for providing prosperity. It is later served to the people in the house for the ceremony. People prepare savouries and sweets such as ''vadai, murukku, payasam'' and visit each other and exchange greetings.

;Maattu Pongal 
[[File:Madurai-alanganallur-jallikattu.jpg|thumb|Jallikattu, or "taming the bull", is an ancient Pongal tradition.]]
The third day of festival is Maattu Pongal (மாட்டுப் பொங்கல்). It is for offering thanks to cattle, as they help farmers in agriculture. On this day the cattle are decorated with paint, flowers and bells. They are allowed to roam free and fed sweet rice and sugar cane. Some people decorate the horns with gold or other metallic covers. In some places, Jallikattu, or taming the wild bull contest, is the main event of this day and this is mostly seen in the villages.

;Kaanum Pongal
The fourth day of the festival is Kaanum Pongal (காணும் பொங்கல்: the word kaanum means "to view"). During this day people visit their relatives, friends to enjoy the festive season. It is a day to thank relatives and friends for their support in the harvest. It started as a farmers festival, called as Uzhavar Thirunaal in Tamil. ''[[Kolam]]'' (கோலம்) decorations are made in front of the house during Thai Pongal festival.

===Uttar Pradesh===

The festival is known as ''Kicheri'' in [[Uttar Pradesh]] and involves ritual bathing.&lt;ref&gt;Bhalla, Kartar Singh (2005) Let's Know Festivals of India.

There is a compulsion to bathe in the morning while fasting; first they bathe then they eat sweets such as til ladoo and gud laddo (known as ''tillava'' in [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]]). At some places new clothes are worn on this day.

Kite flying is an inevitable part of the festival in Uttar Pradesh,&lt;ref name="UP-sankranti" /&gt; as with many states of India such as Gujarat and Maharashtra. Like other places in India, the references to sweets, til ([[sesame seeds]]) and gud ([[jaggery]]) are found in the songs sung on this day:

''Meethe Gur me mil gaya Til'',&lt;br&gt;
''Udi Patang aur khil gaye Dil'',&lt;br&gt;
''Jeevan me bani rahe Sukh aur Shanti'',&lt;br&gt;
''Mubarak ho aapko Makar-Sankranti''.

In West Bengal, Sankranti, also known as Poush Sankranti&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z8FFAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=poush+sankranti+bengal&amp;dq=poush+sankranti+bengal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy24Dr06HRAhUMlxoKHW7DD7EQ6AEIITAB West Bengal District Gazetteers: Calcutta and Howrah 1972]&lt;/ref&gt; named after the Bengali month in which it falls (last date of that month), is celebrated as a harvest festival Poush Parbon ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: পৌষ পার্বণ). (It falls on 14 January on the Western calendar.)  The freshly harvested paddy and the date palm syrup in the form of Khejurer Gur ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: খেজুরের গুড়)and Patali ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: পাটালি ) is used in the preparation of a variety of traditional Bengali sweets made with rice flour, coconut, milk and 'khejurer gur' (date palm jaggery) and known as '[[Pitha]]' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: পিঠে). All sections of society participate in a three-day festival that begins on the day before Sankranti and ends on the day after. The Goddess Lakshmi is usually worshipped on the day of Sankranti.

In the Himalayan regions of Darjeeling, the festival is as known as Magey Sakrati. It is distinctly associated with the worship of Lord Shiva. Traditionally, people bathe at sunrise and then commence their pooja. Elsewhere, many people take a dip in places like Ganga Sagar (the point where the river Ganges meets the Bay of Bengal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article2803812.ece|title=Devotees throng Gangasagar on Makara Sankranti|accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ganga Sagar falls in West Bengal.

In the day of Makar Sankranti Hindu God Dharma is worshiped. And khichurhi or rice is offered to the God as [[Bhog]] (ভোগ). The day after Makar Sankranti the first day in the month Magh from Bengali calendar The Goddess Laxmi devi is worshiped. It is called Baharlaxmi Puja as the idol is worshiped in an open place.

'''Ministry for Refugees, Immigrants and Integration of Denmark''' ({{lang-da|Ministeriet for flygtninge, indvandrere og integration}}) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[political minister|ministerial]] office, often abbreviated as "Ministry for Integration" ({{lang-da|Integrationsminister}}). The office was created by [[Prime Minister (Denmark)|Prime Minister]] [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] on 27 November 2001 when he formed the [[Cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen I]] after the [[2001 Danish parliamentary election]], in which  [[refugee]]s, [[immigration]], and integration of people from non-[[western world|western]] countries had been important issues.

One of the stated goals of the Anders Fogh cabinet, and especially the supporting [[Danish People's Party]] which secured the government's majority, was to "stem the flow" of refugees to Denmark, and new tougher rules did drastically reduce the number of refugees being granted [[Political asylum|asylum]]. Another initiative was the [[24 year rule]], which stated that husbands/wives must be 24 or older before they could immigrate to Denmark through [[family reunification]] (there had been many cases of [[arranged marriage]]s of young people being used to get around immigration restrictions).

It was abolished by the [[Cabinet of Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] after Rasmussen's right-wing alliance lost the [[Danish parliamentary election, 2011|2011 election]].

==New crown==
The [[Carousel Productions|Miss Earth Organizers]] unveiled a new crown to be worn by the winner of Miss Earth 2009, with the preservation of planet Earth as its primary consideration. The crown was designed by an environmentalist jewelry designer from Florida, Ramona Haar, the official jeweller of the Miss Earth pageant.&lt;ref name=missearth-crown&gt;{{cite news|title=About Miss Earth Beauty Pageant |url=http://www.missearth.info/crown.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724224129/http://www.missearth.info/crown.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 July 2009 |publisher=Miss Earth official website, Carousel Productions, Inc |first=Lorraine |last=Schuck |date=10 June 2008 |accessdate=22 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new crown is made of 100% recycled precious metals: [[14kt gold]] and [[argentum]]s [[sterling silver]]. The [[gemstone]]s used were precious and [[semiprecious stone]]s and donations from over 80 participating countries. These are gemstones that each country is known for either as the origin or source. The gemstones were sent in various forms: faceted, cabochons, beads or rough. The designer travelled to [[Jaipur]], India to have these gemstones individually trim and faceted to the required cut and sizes.&lt;ref name=missearth-crown/&gt;

The flower in the center of the crown represents Mother Earth, as inspired by the statement of the American poet, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s "The earth laughs in flowers". The recurring spiral motif has always been associated with "maternal power" and "feminine prestige" which is the essence of Miss Earth. The gentle curves in the crown symbolize "unity" and the "spirit of cooperation".&lt;ref name=missearth-crown/&gt;

'''Nikita Bergenström''' (former ''Juha Veikko Valjakkala'', ''Aslak Valdemar Ahonen'', and '' Nikita Joakim Fouganthine''; 13 June 1965 in [[Pori]], [[Finland]])
is a [[Finland|Finnish]] murderer convicted of the triple [[murder]] of a family in the northern Swedish community of [[Åmsele]].&lt;ref name="alibi2002"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lahtonen|first=Mika|url=http://www.alibi.fi/alibin-parhaat/juha-valjakkalan-erikoishaastattelu|title=Juha Valjakkalan erikoishaastattelu|accessdate=2009-03-04 |date=July 1, 2002 |publisher=Alibi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Åmsele murders ==

The series of events that led to the murders began when the 22-year-old Valjakkala was released from a prison in [[Turku]] on 1 May 1988, after which he started wandering through Sweden and Finland with his 21-year-old then-girlfriend Marita Routalammi.

On 3 July they arrived in Åmsele. After nightfall Valjakkala stole a [[bicycle]]. He was pursued by the owners, Sten Nilsson and his 15-year-old son Fredrik. The chase ended at a [[cemetery]] where Sten and Fredrik Nilsson were both shot by Valjakkala with a [[shotgun]]. Later Sten's wife and Fredrik's mother, Ewa Nilsson, went looking for the two, was chased into the woods and had her throat slit by Valjakkala outside the cemetery. Valjakkala and Routalammi were caught in [[Odense]], [[Denmark]] just over a week later.

At the [[trial (law)|trial]] the two defendants blamed each other for the murders, but the court believed Routalammi's story. A psychiatric evaluation found both to be mentally competent for trial. However, the statement by a forensic psychiatrist found that Valjakkala suffered from a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]]ic personality and was very aggressive. Conviction for the murders was his 12th criminal conviction.&lt;ref name="alibi"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lahtonen|first=Mika|url=http://www.alibi.fi/uutiset/alibi-tapasi-fouganthinen|title=Vietämme normaalia perhe-elämää|accessdate=2009-03-04 |date=February 26, 2009 |publisher=Alibi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Imprisonment and escape attempts ==

Valjakkala was given a [[life imprisonment|life sentence]] on three counts of murder, while Routalammi received two years for complicity in assault and battery. Routalammi was released after serving half of her time, and Valjakkala was transferred to Finland to serve out the rest of his sentence.

Valjakkala tried to escape from prison in 1991.

In April 1994 Valjakkala fled the [[Riihimäki]] prison in Finland where he was being held. He took a teacher as a hostage, but he was apprehended nearby and the hostage escaped the situation unscathed.

In 2002 he escaped from Pyhäselkä prison and traveled to Sweden with his wife, and was captured after a large police operation in [[Långträsk]]. Upon returning to prison after the 2002 escape he tried to commit suicide by hanging himself in his cell.

His next escape in 2004 from Sukeva prison lasted only 19 minutes and reached less than 1&amp;nbsp;km from the prison walls.

Just after midnight on 28 November 2006 Valjakkala escaped for the fourth time, this time from the labor prison in [[Hamina]]. He was captured on the evening of 30 November 2006 by police Readiness Unit [[Karhuryhmä]] in [[Maunula]], [[Helsinki]]. Police assaulted the apartment which was suspected to be Valjakkala's hideout. Valjakkala was captured without resistance. After the incident Valjakkala went back to closed prison.

Valjakkala changed his name to Nikita Joakim Fouganthine in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=721369|title=Ingen här vill att han ska släppas |trans-title=Nobody here wants him to be released |last=Rydman|first=Annika|date=2007-12-03|newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2008-12-17}}{{Dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later to Nikita Bergenström in 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/nimensa_vaihtaneen_foughanthinen_tuomio_aleni_hovissa/6724500|title=Nimensä vaihtaneen Foughanthinen tuomio aleni hovissa|last= |first= |date=2015-11-04|newspaper=[[YLE]]|language=Finnish|accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parole ==

Having served 19 years in prison, Fouganthine was due to be released on [[parole]] on 1 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/rikos.shtml/arkistot/rikos/2007/12/588109 MTV.fi]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fouganthine was released on 25 February 2008. He was arrested again on 12 April 2008 for breaking his release terms. He is likely to face charges for, among other things, endangering the traffic, stealing a vehicle and driving a vehicle without a licence and driving an unlicensed taxi. Valjakkala has admitted to the above.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/200805137646916_uu.shtml Kuulustelut alkoivat - Valjakkala vetosi paniikkiin | Uutiset | Iltalehti.fi&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fouganthine and his wife Alexandra married in May 2008.&lt;ref name="alibi"/&gt;

In December 2008 the [[Supreme Court of Finland]] decided that he would be released with a suspended sentence on February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=864784|title=Åmselemördaren blir villkorligt frigiven |trans-title=Åmsele killer paroled |last=Lundberg|first=Stefan|date=2008-12-17|newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2008-12-17}}{{Dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fouganthine was paroled again on February 2.&lt;ref name="alibi"/&gt; In a recent interview he revealed that he is currently writing an [[autobiography]].&lt;ref name="alibi"/&gt;

On 23 November 2011 he escaped from Kerava's parole prison. The Finnish police say that he might be somewhere else than Finland. On 1 December Nikita Fouganthine was found in [[Vallila]], Helsinki. It is not believed that Fouganthine committed any crimes during his escape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://omakaupunki.hs.fi/paakaupunkiseutu/uutiset/nikita_fouganthine_saatiin_kiinni/ nikita fouganthine saatiin kiini&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202162747/http://omakaupunki.hs.fi/paakaupunkiseutu/uutiset/nikita_fouganthine_saatiin_kiinni/ |date=December 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==

In 1991, Swedish director [[Jan Troell]] directed a film based on the Åmsele murders, ''[[Il Capitano: A Swedish Requiem|Il Capitano]]'', starring [[Antti Reini]].

Nikita Bergenström is credited as Juha Valjakkala in ''[[The Girl Who Played with Fire]]'', in a comparison between criminals' profiles.

The eighteenth episode of the Danish television drama ''[[Rejseholdet]]'' is based on the Åmsele murders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2673">[[File:O-dot.png|right|200px]]'''O͘''' is one of the six [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] [[vowel]]s as written in the [[Peh-oe-ji]] (POJ) [[orthography]]. It is a normal [[o]] followed by [[Unicode]] {{unichar|0358|COMBINING DOT ABOVE RIGHT}}, and is not to be confused with the Vietnamese [[Ơ]]. It is pronounced {{IPAblink|ɔ}}.

This letter is [[Taiwanese_Minnan#Computing|not well-supported by fonts]] and is often typed as either '''o·''' (using the [[interpunct]]), '''o•''' (using the [[Bullet (typography)|bullet]]), '''oo''', or '''ou'''.

Because Taiwanese is a [[tonal language]] the standard letter without a [[diacritic]] represents the vowel in the first tone, the other four possible tone categories require one of the following tonal symbols to be written above it.
*Ó͘ ó͘ (second tone)
*Ò͘ ò͘ (third tone)
*Ô͘ ô͘ (fifth tone)
*Ǒ͘ ǒ͘ (sixth tone)
*Ō͘ ō͘ (seventh tone)

==History==
The character was introduced by the [[Xiamen]]-based missionary [[Elihu Doty]] in the mid-nineteenth century, as a way to distinguish the [[Minnan language|Minnan]] vowels {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} (the latter becoming {{angle bracket|o͘}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://203.64.42.21/giankiu/GTH/2002/TOLMJ/giteng/lunbun/K2-kloeter.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529221109/http://203.64.42.21/giankiu/GTH/2002/TOLMJ/giteng/lunbun/K2-kloeter.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-05-29|title=The History of Peh-oe-ji|last=Klöter|first=Henning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has become established in the Peh-oe-ji orthography, with only occasional deviations early in its usage – one example being [[Carstairs Douglas]]'s 1873 dictionary, where he replaced the {{angle bracket|o͘}} with an o with a curl (similar to that of the [[English Phonotypic Alphabet]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese English Dictionary of the Vernacular or Spoken of Amoy|last=Douglas|first=Carstairs|author-link=Carstairs Douglas|origyear=1873|year=1990|location=Taipei|publisher=Southern Materials Center|isbn=957-9482-32-2|url=https://archive.org/details/chineseenglishdict00doug}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second example being Tan Siew Imm's 2016 dictionary of [[Penang Hokkien]], where she replaced the {{angle bracket|o͘}} with {{angle bracket|[[ɵ]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siew Imm |title=Penang Hokkien-English Dictionary |date=2016 |publisher=Areca Books |url=https://arecabooks.com/product/penang-hokkien-english-dictionary-2/ |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12646">'''Piracy in [[Indonesia]]''' is not only notorious, but according to a survey conducted by the [[International Maritime Bureau]], it was also the country sporting the highest rate of pirate attacks back in 2004, where it subsequently dropped to second place of the world's worst country of [[pirate]] attacks in 2008, finishing just behind [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name="Alive and Dangerous"&gt;{{cite web|last=Read|first=Sophia|title=Piracy: Alive and Dangerous in the 21st Century|url=http://www.thebalitimes.com/2008/05/02/piracy-alive-and-dangerous-in-the-21st-century/|publisher=The Bali Times|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Indonesia is still deemed as the country with the world's most dangerous water due to its high piracy rate.&lt;ref name="Sea piracy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sea Piracy Hits Record High|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/01/27/pirates/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=26 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With more than half of the world's piracy crimes surrounding the South-East Asia aquatic regions, the turmoil caused by piracy has made the [[Strait of Malacca]] a distinct pirate hotspot accounting for most of the attacks in Indonesia, making the ships that sail in this region risky ever since the [[Europeans]] arrived.&lt;ref name="Alive and Dangerous" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia Piracy Hotspot|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1002308.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 March 2013|date=1 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'Piracy in Indonesia' includes both cases of Indonesian pirates hijacking other cargo and tanks, as well as the high rate of practising piracy within the country itself. The Strait of Malacca is also one of the world's busiest shipping routes as it accounts for more than twenty-five percent of the world's barter goods that come mainly from [[China]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Alive and Dangerous" /&gt; Approximately 50,000 vessels worth of the world's trade employ the strait annually, including oil from the [[Persian Gulf]] and manufactured goods to the [[Middle East]] and [[Suez Canal]]. The success that stems from this trade portal makes the Strait an ideal location for pirate attacks.&lt;ref name="Success in Strait"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schuman|first=Michael|title=How to Defeat Pirates: Success in the Strait |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1893032,00.html|publisher=TIme World|accessdate=30 April 2013|date=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for pirate attacks ==

According to the International Maritime Bureau, the pirates are able to bypass authorities and elude detection by taking cover in numerous islands that readily surround the area. The region surrounding Indonesia alone has an estimate of over seventeen hundred islands and a seascape of tropical isles in which pirates are able to seek refuge.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Success in Strait" /&gt; In addition, numerous major naval forces that use to patrol high seas has declined by fifty percent and this has adversely propelled the rate of pirate attacks in Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Survival Insights"&gt;{{cite web|last=Maggio|first=Edward J.|title=Maritime Piracy|url=http://www.survivalinsights.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=46|publisher=Survival Insights|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these crimes are conducted for [[ransom]], but there is a huge risk involved when these pirates are illegal [[syndicates]] who [[Maritime hijacking|hijack]] tug boats, barges and large tankers. These containers carry explosive natural gases that can be used as weapons.&lt;ref name="Sea piracy" /&gt; The worry on piracy in Indonesia continues to soar when it was recorded back in 2012 that across the [[Indonesian archipelago]], the number of petty thefts recorded was eighty-one and this accounts to more than one quarter of the world's piracy incidents.&lt;ref name="SeaShip News"&gt;{{cite web|title=SeaShip News|url=http://www.seashipnews.com/news_content.php?fid=3w3c497|publisher=SeaShip News|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, economic drivers such as poverty and corruption also accounts to the high rates of pirate attacks.&lt;ref name="MOFA Japan" /&gt; As supported in a research article by [http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/ps/faculty/node/25561 David Rosenberg], the number of crimes has shot up ever since the 1997 currency crisis in Indonesia, driving numerous people to becoming pirates solely to earn a living wage.&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=David|title=The Political Economy of Piracy in the South China Sea|year=2009|publisher=Naval War College Press|pages=46–51|url=http://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/cd4a4cfa-eaa0-4040-9d51-a4b90b7a83d5/The-Political-Economy-of-Piracy-in-the-South-China}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bali Times, [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and Indonesia are all responsible for patrolling their own regions and they do not have any jurisdiction beyond their water territories, making regional waters vulnerable and easy for pirates to escape.&lt;ref name="Alive and Dangerous" /&gt; Furthermore, with Indonesia's coastline being twice as long as the perimeter of the earth, patrolling their water territory with slightly more than a dozen vessels is clearly inadequate.&lt;ref name=Rosenberg /&gt; Within the first six months of 2012, Indonesia alone is responsible for twenty percent of the pirate attacks that happened globally.&lt;ref name="The Jakarta Globe"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vit|first=Jonathan|title=Criminals Increasingly Targeting Indonesian Ports: World Piracy Report|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/criminals-increasingly-targeting-indonesian-ports-world-piracy-report/530837|publisher=The Jakarta Globe|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent cases ==
Over the last ten years, the number of pirate attacks in Indonesia has dropped. However, there are still numerous reports on piracy occurring along coastal areas and gulfs. In 2011, 15 attacks were recorded in the month of January alone, where five attacks amounted to the total number of crimes during the first quarter of that respective year.&lt;ref name="Jakarta Globe- DOA" /&gt; In addition, during the month of September in that same year, two incidences of pirate attacks were reported. The first group consisted of four Indonesian pirates who were being arrested where they confessed that they [[aided]] and abetted a larger syndicate that operated in the Strait of Malacca.&lt;ref name=VOA&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamb|first=Kate|title=Indonesian Pirate Arrest Leads to Broader Network in Malacca Strait|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/indonesian-pirate-arrest-leads-to-broader-network-in-malacca-strait-130625373/145799.html|publisher=Voice of America|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second group of attackers during that month included six Indonesian men who were being detained. They were suspects for a group of Indonesian pirates that allegedly boarded a merchant vessel in Singapore. During the attack, warning shots were being fired and the pirates fled the scene. It is believed that the group arrived from [[Batam]], an island that was closely situated to the Strait.&lt;ref name="Maritime Executive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesian Piracy Attack Deterred Off Malaysia, 6 Men Detained|url=http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/indonesian-piracy-attack-deterred-off-malaysia-6-men-detained/|publisher=Maritime Executive|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, four pirates boarded a Bulk Carrier in Gresik Inner Anchorage, Indonesia, and entered the forward ship's store. They managed to escape when a crew spotted them, but the pirates made off with a few property from the store.&lt;ref name=ICC&gt;{{cite web|title=Live Piracy &amp; Armed Robbery Report 2013|url=http://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre/live-piracy-report|publisher=ICC Commercial Crime Service|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government intervention ===
Back in 2003, CNN reported that unless the Indonesian government enforces sea patrol, the crime rates for piracy will not be dropping anytime soon.&lt;ref name="Sea piracy" /&gt; However, after an attack back in the 1990s, Indonesia has partnered with Singapore and Malaysia to safeguard, monitor and ensure the security and safety of the water that borders outside their respective territory. One way to aid the problem, as reported by the International Maritime Bureau, is to be vigilant because pirates often abandon their attacks the moment they are being spotted. This is why the relationship between ship and water is vital.&lt;ref name="VOA- Solutions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spike in Pirate Attacks in Indonesian Waters Raises Warnings|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/spike-in-pirate-attacks-in-indonesian-waters-raises-warnings-102283754/125236.html|publisher=Voice of America|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [http://oceansbeyondpiracy.org Oceans Beyond Piracy], which is a project that looks to develop a multi-stakeholders response to piracy, they reported that a cooperative security measure undertaken by Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and [[Thailand]] ensures the security of the Strait of Malacca by instilling the Malacca Strait Patrols (MSP). The MSP comprises the Malacca Strait Sea Patrol (MSSP), the Eyes in the Sky (EiS) and the Intelligence Exchange Group (IEG) and the information that is being gathered on pirate attacks in Indonesia is being facilitated and shared between the countries. Furthermore, co-ordinated patrols have also been established.&lt;ref name="Oceans Beyond Piracy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oceans Beyond Piracy|url=http://oceansbeyondpiracy.org/matrix/activity/malacca-strait-patrols|publisher=Oceans Beyond Piracy|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, two warships were being deployed by Indonesia and Malaysia as part of a collaboration patrol to supervise pirate attacks at the Strait of Malacca.&lt;ref name="Combating Maritime Piracy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Alessi|first=Christopher|title=Combating Maritime Piracy|url=http://www.cfr.org/france/combating-maritime-piracy/p18376|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As recorded by Time World, an Indonesian naval officer claimed that they would be no match for the pirates back in 2004 because there were easy attacks-and-escape routes that made hunting these pirates down radically impossible. The number of attacks during 2004 also reached its crisis level. However, as of 2009, this problem has been countered as the rate of pirate crimes have dissipated.&lt;ref name="Success in Strait" /&gt; Although the number of pirate attacks that have occurred in the first quarter of the year in 2009 has almost doubled in comparison to the same period the year before, only one pirate attack took place in Indonesia as opposed to the 102 attacks that happened globally. The solution, as mentioned by the director of the International Marine Bureau in London, said that good coordination and cooperation from regional governments play a part in deterring the attacks on commercial shipping, because cohesive supervision leads to a riskier task for the pirates.&lt;ref name="Success in Strait" /&gt;

'''Rinconada Bikol''' or simply '''Rinconada''', spoken in the province of [[Camarines Sur]], [[Philippines]], is one of several languages that compose the Inland Bikol (or Southern Bicol) group of the [[Bikol languages|Bikol macrolanguage]]. It belongs to the [[Austronesian language family]] that also includes most [[Philippine languages]], the [[Formosan languages]] of [[Taiwanese aborigines]], [[Malay language|Malay]] ([[Bahasa Indonesia]] and [[Bahasa Malaysia]]), the [[Polynesian languages]] and [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]].

Rinconada is surrounded and shared common features with other Bikol languages. It is bordered by Coastal Bikol to the north, Buhinon to the east, and West Miraya language immediately to the south. The closest relatives to this language outside the Bicol region are [[Aklanon language|Aklanon]], [[Waray-Waray language|Waray-Waray]], and to a lesser extent, [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], especially the variants used in [[Batangas]] and [[Marinduque]].

Rinconada Bikol is the language adopted by the indigenous population of Agta/Aeta (the [[Negrito]]) in the surrounding mountainous areas of [[Mount Iriga]] (old name is Mount Asog). The [[Austronesian]] people that have migrated to the foot of Mount Asog from the lowland Nabua introduced the language to [[Negrito]]s when they began conducting trade and commerce, thus replacing the native language of the latter. The original language of Negritos is ''Inagta'' also known to linguists as [[Mount Iriga Agta]], an extinct or nearly extinct language. [[Mt. Iriga Agta language|Inagta]] is said to have 86% intelligibility with Rinconada Bikol but with lexical similarity of 76%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ang A language of Philippines|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/agz|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Negritos or commonly called as Agta or Aeta (''Ŋod'' for camaraderie) today are fluent in Rinconada Bikol though with a different variation.

== Name ==
[[File:Camarines Sur 5th congressional district.png|300px|thumbnail|right|5th congressional district of Camarines Sur]]
The name "Rinconada" is derived from the Rinconada District in Camarines Sur where the language originated, developed and is largely spoken. However, the precise origins of how the term "Rinconada"  was assigned to the area are still unclear. Popular wisdom ascribes the name to have come from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''arrinconada'', "cornered", from the root ''[[rincon (disambiguation)|rincón]]'' that means "corner or small district".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Rinconada might have been given by the Spaniards to the then-newly explored and established colony in the southeastern corner of [[Luzon Island]]; natives formerly called the area ''Sumagang'' (Sumagaŋ), meaning "far east".

Adding credence to the theory of a Spanish origin are the localities of [[La Rinconada]] in Spain and [[Rinconada|La Rinconada]] in [[Chile]], which was also a former Spanish colony.

== Dialects ==
The language is divided into two main dialects and subdivided into six variants:

=== Sinabukid (highland dialect) ===
(Strong accent, flat intonation only, and with {{IPA|/ə/}})
*Agta variant
*Iriga variant (de facto standard)

=== Sinaranəw (lowland dialect) ===
(Soft accent with different types of intonation, and without {{IPA|/ə/}}) 
*Nabua – Balatan variant
*Baao variant
*Bula – Pili variant
*Bato variant

=== Dialectal Variation ===

• The Nabua-Balatan variant features high pitch intonation. Though it is the direct descendant of Rinconada Bikol but it lost some features of the original spoken language. The speakers can be found in the entire municipalities of Nabua and Balatan.

• Iriga variant on the other hand has the most speakers. The speakers are concentrated in the district's center - Iriga City, in some of the important barangays of Buhi (West and East Sta. Justina and De Los Angeles), and the urban barangay of Matacon located in Polangui, Albay. The Iriga variant has a flat intonation and is spoken rapidly.

• The Bato variant, on the other hand, has a distinctive mellow intonation. It is said that regardless of one's mood, the Bato speaker always sounds sleepy, as if they are chanting. The Bato variant is primarily being spoken in Bato, Camarines Sur and also spoken in Agos, Polangui, Albay.

• The Agta variant is the smallest in the group. The speakers are exclusively the indigenous population of Agta/Aeta, the aboriginal people of different tribes surrounding [[Mount Iriga]] and Buhi lake. Like Iriga, the Agta variant also has a flat intonation but they speak the language with distinct form of pronunciation which can be traced from the group's extinct language.

• The variants of Baao and Bula-Pili are considered twins. They have the same accent and only slight differences in vocabulary. Of the two variants, Baao often uses rising intonation, while Bula-Pili is moderately flat but both are using high pitch when reasoning. The latter variant is used entirely in Bula and in the southern half of the provincial capital town of Pili. It also has significant speakers in Ocampo, Cam. Sur and Minalabac, Cam. Sur. These two variants have borrowed some vocabularies of Coastal Bikol but at the same time, Bikol-Partido (a dialect of Coastal Bikol) can be heard with borrowed vocabularies from these two variants.

List of phrases and expressions that are unique to each variant:

Baao variant:            "'''Gaorag na!'''"&lt;br /&gt;
Nabua – Balatan variant: "'''Labinā kan.'''"&lt;br /&gt;
Agta variant:            "'''Mayaŋ na ŋod.'''"&lt;br /&gt;
Bato variant:            "'''Ay tarā?'''"&lt;br /&gt;
Bula – Pili variant:     "'''Paiŋōrag..'''"&lt;br /&gt;
Iriga variant:           "'''Labinā man nâ!'''"

== Short imperatives ==

Like other Visayan and Bikol languages, Rinconada Bikol has a short form for the imperative.

e.g.: &lt;br /&gt;
The phrase "iyəwən mo" (grill it) is often shortened to "iyəwā" and the command phrase "punāsan mo a salmiŋ" (wipe the mirror) can be shortened to "punāsa a salmiŋ".

A special form is used when talking to elderly people in a polite manner. Instead of putting the letters "ā/a" after the root word of the verb, it has to be replaced by the letters "e/ē" if the statement will be politely delivered. The letter "e" or "ē" stands for "tābî" which means "please" in English, or "po" in Tagalog.

Example 1: &lt;br /&gt;
"iyəw" is a root word that means "grill". &lt;br /&gt;
"iyəwən" means "grill it". &lt;br /&gt;
"iyəwən mo" roughly means "you, grill it". &lt;br /&gt;
"iyəwā" is the shortcut of the command "iyəwən mo". &lt;br /&gt;
"iyəwē" is the shortened polite form for "iyəwən mo tābî" (grill it please).

Example 2: &lt;br /&gt;
"punas" is a root word that means "wipe". &lt;br /&gt;
"punasan" means "wipe it". &lt;br /&gt;
"punasan mo" roughly means "you, wipe it". &lt;br /&gt;
"punāsa" is the shortcut of the command "punāsan mo". &lt;br /&gt;
"punāse" is the shortened polite form for "punāsan mo tābî" (wipe it please).

Example 3: &lt;br /&gt;
"īmo" is a root word that means "prepare". &lt;br /&gt;
"imō{{IPA|ɣ}}on" means "prepare it".&lt;br /&gt;
"imō{{IPA|ɣ}}on mo" means "you, prepare it". &lt;br /&gt;
"imō{{IPA|ɣ}}a" is the shortcut of the command "imō{{IPA|ɣ}}on mo". &lt;br /&gt;
"imō{{IPA|ɣ}}e" is the shortened polite form for "imō{{IPA|ɣ}}on mo tābî" (please prepare it).

=== Greetings ===

General Greetings: &lt;br /&gt;
Maray na aldəw - Good day (from sunrise to sunset) &lt;br /&gt;
Maray na gab-ī - Good evening (from sunset to sunrise) 
*The said greetings can be shorten to "Aldəw" and "Gab-ī" as they are like the two-syllable words "Bonjour" and "Bonsoir" of the French language.

Specific Greetings:&lt;br /&gt;
Maray na ramrag - Good morning (from 6AM to 11AM)&lt;br /&gt;
Maray na mudtū - Good noon (from 11AM to 1PM)&lt;br /&gt;
Maray na apon - Good afternoon (from 1PM to 6PM)&lt;br /&gt;
Maray na gab-ī - Good evening (from 6PM to 11PM)&lt;br /&gt;
Maray na lawəd - Good midnight (from 11PM to 1AM)&lt;br /&gt;
Maray na mararamrāgən - Good dawn (from 1AM to 6AM)

People of Rinconada classify dim or dark hours as nighttime and light hours as daytime. As such, even with the introduction of Modern Standard Time, they consider the hours of 12 midnight until 6 o'clock in the morning as nighttime. Therefore, the general greeting from 6AM to 6PM is "Maray na aldəw", and "Maray na gab-ī" for the hours that start from 6PM to 6AM.

e.g. Maray na mudtū tabî kaninyō ŋāmin!

Occasional Greetings: &lt;br /&gt;
Mamə̄yaŋ Pagkaməndag! - Happy Birthday. &lt;br /&gt;
Mamə̄yaŋ Bāgoŋ Taon! - Happy New Year. &lt;br /&gt;
Mamə̄yaŋ Anibersāryo! - Happy Anniversary.

== Uniqueness and distinction ==

Rinconada Bikol vocabulary is rich in words with short or unstressed letter "i" sound. In fact, most root words with letter "i" are unstressed. However, not all words with "i" should be read and pronounced as such since there are several words that have stressed " ī ", especially loanwords, e.g. sīli (chili). Native words (root word) with stressed "ī" are very rare.

The language retains the proto-Philippine schwa vowel {{IPA|/ə/}} that have disappeared in most Philippine languages like [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and even the neighboring Coastal Bikol language. In Nabua, Camarines Sur (where the language is believed to be originated), the vowel also disappeared through the normal development and evolution. However, it was preserved by those who moved and migrated to the highland part of Rinconada around Mount Iriga (formerly Mount Asog) due to severe flooding on lowland, particularly in Nabua and Bula. Thus, preserving the vowel and has survived until this day in Sinabukid dialect.

People who are new to the highland accent may find the Sinabukid dialect sounds like [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]], [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinense]], or [[Karay-a language|Karay-a]] of [[Antique (province)|Antique province]]. The vowel can also be heard from the population in towns and cities speaking the [[Albay Bicolano|Albay Bikol]] group of languages. The native word for this vowel in Rinconada is "gəpə", and this has divided the language into two dialects – Sinabukid or Highland (with {{IPA|/ə/}}) and Sinaranəw or Lowland (without {{IPA|/ə/}}).

Aside from the vowel {{IPA|/ə/}}, the other interesting thing in Rinconada language is the occurrence of an extra consonant phoneme {{IPA|/ɣ/}}. This consonant bears the sound of mixed letters "h, y and "w". The neighboring language of Buhinon also uses this sound - a clear evidence of close ties between the two languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/4440/214/olson09-link.pdf |title=language of Buhi (Buhinon)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unfortunately, this phoneme neither has a corresponding letter in Philippine alphabet nor an equivalent character on Philippine standard keyboard. Thus, Rinconada Bikol speakers have no option but to use "h" as an alternative letter. However, in the spoken Sinaranəw dialect, the consonant {{IPA|/ɣ/}} and the vowel {{IPA|/ə/}} are often replaced by the letters "w" and "o" respectively.

Examples of letter {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɣ}}}}

1. Mima{{IPA|ɣ}}əw – will eat breakfast.
(Mudtū na, mima'''{{IPA|ɣ}}'''əw pa sanā ikā?)

2. Ba{{IPA|ɣ}}əw – cold cooked rice.
(Naŋagnəw na man na kānən na adī, malākaba'''{{IPA|ɣ}}'''əw!)

3. Ta{{IPA|ɣ}}əp – a process of separating rice from its outside layer after milling. "Tahip" in Filipino/Tagalog.
(A pagta'''{{IPA|ɣ}}'''əp, əsad na gīboŋ dirî dāpat pinagdə̄dəlagan.)

4. Da{{IPA|ɣ}}un – plant leaf.
(Kadakəl ka da'''{{IPA|ɣ}}'''un ka tanəm ni Tāta Isko.)

5. Ta{{IPA|ɣ}}ob – cover, protect, or conceal. 
(Pakarāyən mo a pagkāta'''{{IPA|ɣ}}'''ob ka bobon ta mauŋkaŋ ikā sīton!)

*The special consonant phoneme {{IPA|/ɣ/}} can easily be distinguished from the sound of letters "h,w and y" if it is placed before the vowel phoneme {{IPA|/ə/}}. It can be compared to the letter "j" of the Spanish word "Dios Mamajes".

=== Pronunciation of letters {{angle bracket|e}} and {{angle bracket|ē}} ===

The letter {{angle bracket|e}} in Rinconada is not the typical pronunciation of the vowel /[[e]]/ in other languages - such as the word ''beg'' and ''bell'' in English language, or the word ''metung'' in [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] that means "one" - which sounds {{IPAblink|ɛ}} in IPA (open- or low-mid front unrounded vowel). The letter {{angle bracket|e}} in Rinconada is pronounced similar to the letter-sequence {{angle bracket|ee}} in English, or the letter {{angle bracket|i}} of most languages, but mouth is more open and tongue is a bit relaxed. In IPA it is {{IPAblink|e}}, a close- or high-mid front unrounded vowel.
So its pronunciation lies in-between ''leed''´s {{IPAblink|i}} sound and ''led''´s {{IPAblink|ɛ}}.

The difference between the letters {{angle bracket|e}} and {{angle bracket|ē}} is that the latter pronounced longer or prolonged.

Example: ''mutēte'' (IPA: muteːte) - chide, scold.

=== Rules for letter [ j ] ===

Unlike other letters in Rinconada native alphabet, letter [ [[j]] ] is always accompanied by letter [ [[d]] ] if it is in the middle of a word. Otherwise, single [j] is to be placed. Moreover, it's the only non-gliding consonant that cannot be found at the end of a word in any native Rinconada vocabulary.

Some words in native Rinconada and rinconadized words of foreign origin with letter [j]:

'''j'''amantē - ''diamond (from Spanish 'diamante').''&lt;br /&gt;
'''j'''āday - ''again, always.''&lt;br /&gt;
'''j'''āryo - ''newspaper (from Spanish 'diario').'' &lt;br /&gt;
'''j'''ōlen - ''marble (toy).'' &lt;br /&gt;
pasti'''dj'''ō - ''nuisance (from Spanish 'fastidio')''&lt;br /&gt;
i'''dj'''əw - ''a large and venomous snake.'' &lt;br /&gt;
oo'''dj'''on - ''*no counterpart in English and Filipino (nearest meaning: 'jealous' or 'envious').''&lt;br /&gt;
su'''dj'''â - ''prompted, investigated, an action for questioning.''&lt;br /&gt;
ka'''dj'''apā - ''a thorny plant abundant in Bicol region, 'kulitis' in Tagalog (scientific name: Amaranthus Spinosus).''&lt;br /&gt;
pa'''dj'''ak - ''a bicycle converted into tricycle powered by a human force (mode of transportation known in Metro Manila as 'kuliglig').'' &lt;br /&gt;
so'''dj'''aŋ - ''a sharp piece of wood, metal or bamboo that gets in and stuck to the flesh accidentally''. &lt;br /&gt;
loka'''dj'''ô - ''a word used to address a dislike person being discussed in a conversation. It is a word included in Bikol Angry Speech Register.'' &lt;br /&gt;
paŋa'''dj'''î - ''prayer''.

=== The consonant [h] ===

Through language evolution, Rinconada Bikol almost lost the phoneme [h], hence, rare. It is often absent in most Rinconada words that are usually present in other Philippine languages.

There is no real [h] sound in Rinconada. It is either silent or glided that sounds like a long tonal vowel, or vowel lengthening. The [h] sound is silent if positioned at the beginning of a word, and glided if it is in between vowels. The Tagalog words such as ''hangin'', ''higop'' and ''hanggan'' are almost the same with Rinconada words but letter [h] is eliminated since it is not pronounced. The corresponding equivalent is ''aŋin'', ''igop'' and ''aŋgan''. Same with other Bikol words like ''harani'', ''harayo'', and ''habo'' which are ''arāni'', ''arayô'', and ''abə'' in Rinconada. While the glided [h] can be found in between two same letters like in ''baha'', ''saha'', ''kohol'', and ''mohon''.

The disappearance of phoneme [h] is an occurrence comparable (but not the same degree) to that of [[Kapampangan language]]. Nevertheless, Rinconada Bikol speakers can pronounce it with clarity and emphasis whenever they are speaking other languages where it is present.

== Vocabulary ==
[[File:Rinconada sticker.jpg|220px|right|thumb|An election campaign sticker in Rinconada Bikol written in simplified alphabet. (''Note the use of [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] (ü) instead of the schwa vowel {{angle bracket|ə}} to aid the sinaranəw speakers in reading the message''.)]]
For centuries under Spanish rules, Rinconada has adopted many words from [[Spanish language]]. There is a considerable number of Latin loans (sometimes obscured by being subject to Rinconada phonology and grammar for centuries), for example: ''estar'' ("address or dwelling place", from ''estar'' that means "stay"), ''soltēro'' ("single" but only applicable to male, from ''soltero''), ''{{IPA|ɣ}}ūben'' ("young" from ''joven''), ''ilyābe'' ("key", from ''llave'').

Older generations tend to use Spanish loanwords more often but younger generations tend to use Tagalog words and rinconadized words from English language especially the modern terminologies with no counterpart in native Rinconada Bikol vocabulary.

Example:

'''''Bawas-bawāsan''' mo man ŋanî a pag'''kātiŋ''' mo '''lalô''' na kin arāni na a '''eksam'''.'' (Limit your habit of escaping class sessions especially when examination is approaching near).

The Tagalog word "bawas-bawāsan" is "inâ-ināan" in Rinconada and the word "lalô" is used in favor of the native word "orog". The word "kātiŋ" and "eksam" are rinconadized words of the English "cutting" (cutting classes or leaving the room during school hours with no permission), and "exam" (examination) respectively.

== Standard Rinconada Bikol ==
There is no official or ''de jure'' standard dialect of this language, though the Iriga dialect is used as the ''de facto'' standard for the following reasons:

1. It retains the proto-Austronesian schwa vowel {{IPA|/ə/}} that helps eliminate homographs (words that are spelled the same way but have different pronunciations and meanings).&lt;br /&gt;
2. The consonant phoneme {{IPA|/ɣ/}} is evident and pronounced more clearly.&lt;br /&gt;
3. It has a neutralized and flat intonation which serves to moderate between variants.&lt;br /&gt;
4. It has no continuum accent or fusion of variants in between boundaries. &lt;br /&gt; ''One example of continuum accent can be heard in barangays bordering Bula and Nabua which the speakers have mixed accents of Bula-Pili variant and Nabua-Balatan variant. Same thing can be heard in the boundaries of Baao and Nabua.''&lt;br /&gt;
5. Iriga City is the center of learning, trade and commerce in Rinconada. &lt;br /&gt;
6. It has fewer loan words and is less influenced by neighboring languages than any other variant except Agta. &lt;br /&gt;
7. It has been used for decades to represent Rinconada as a whole at the local and national level.&lt;br /&gt;
8. It has the most number of speakers inside and outside the Rinconada area.&lt;br /&gt;
9. There's no or little variation in accent among speakers. Whether a person resides in the northeasternmost part of Iriga bordering Bikol-Partido speakers or in the southernmost part of Matacon, Polangui bordering West Miraya speakers or in East Sta. Justina, Buhi bordering Buhinon speakers, all use the same accent with centralized intonation.

*Even with the usage of Iriga variant (highland dialect) as the Rinconada standard (both in spelling and pronunciation), all other variants remain official in their respective municipalities. The standard spelling must be observed in all written forms but can be pronounced differently depending on the accent of the speakers.

e.g. "lawəd" (midnight) can be pronounced as "lawod, lawəd or lawud" by speakers but MUST be written officially as "lawəd" across variants.

The language is commonly called as Rinconada but officially called as Rinconada Bikol (de jure) and not Iriga Bikol, Irigueño, Baaoeño or Bikol Nabua.

== Angry speech register ==

The angry register is unique to Bicol languages as it cannot be found in other Austronesian languages inside and outside the Philippines. It is generally used only among same-age speakers or by older speakers to younger listeners, as usage by younger speakers in addressing their elders would constitute great disrespect. On occasion, the angry register is used in sarcasm or humor, but the majority of its usage is in anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.silinternational.com/asia/Philippines/books/CurrentIssues_3.1.pdf | title=Bikol Angry Register | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222131927/http://www.silinternational.com/asia/Philippines/books/CurrentIssues_3.1.pdf | archivedate=2014-02-22 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rinconada Bikol has contributed much to this unique feature of spoken languages of Bicolanos.

== Sainigin ==

Sainigin is a group of selected words for babies and newly born. It is being used by parents to communicate with their babies easily and to train them how to talk, hence, an introductory language. It is often described as language for babies and commonly called as "baby talk". Words are limited to two syllables and features basic command. Several letters are absent such as "r, g, s, j, and h". Sainigin literally means "talking or acting like a baby".

=== Diacritics (kul-it) ===

Rinconada uses a variation of Latin alphabet modeled on the Tagalog alphabet. But unlike the modern Tagalog - Filipino, Rinconada retains and uses diacritics ('kul-it' in Rinconada Bikol, and 'kudlit' in Tagalog). This is to highlight the meaning of the words and to differentiate words with different meanings but the same spelling. In return, the diacritics provide Rinconada Bikol with a unique orthography among Philippine languages. Diacritics for this language are limited to the macron and circumflex which is unlike other languages, for example [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] that has several. However, due to technical difficulties and a scarcity of resources, diacritics are sometimes not available. Thus, two Rinconada alphabets were created to meet the needs of the speakers: the NATIVE and the SIMPLIFIED. Both can be used at the same time depending on the situation, purpose and availability of resources.

=== Glottal stop (rəgsad) ===

The Rinconada name for the letter which represents the glottal stop is "rəgsad". This can only be found in the native form of alphabet, and it is limited to final vowels or vowels at the end of a word. Rəgsad is represented by the circumflex ( ˆ ).

For examples of the glottal stop, consider the Rinconada words salâ (wrong) and turô (drop of water/fluid), often simply sala and turo in the simplified alphabet and in Filipino and English orthographies.

*With rəgsad and kul-it, the translation of the phrase '''I love you''' in Rinconada is ''Ayabâ ko ikā'' ("love me you" in word-for-word translation).

=== Alphabet ===

Rinconada Bikol was historically written in a form of Abugida writing system called Baybayin in Tagalog and Kul-ītan in Rinconada.

==== Native ====

The Rinconada Native alphabet has 6 short vowels, 6 long vowels, and 17 consonants, a total of 29 letters representing all phonemes in Rinconada Bikol. A long or stressed vowel is written with a macron (a diacritic placed above a vowel). It also includes the velar nasal special character /ŋ/ that represents "NG". Native alphabet contains phonemes that are native to Rinconada, thus considering it as the standard Rinconada Bikol alphabet.

*Exceptions to the rules of native alphabet are formal names like Juan Dela Cruz and placenames such as Laguna, Cebu and Manila. Those names must retain their official and simplified spelling instead of their native spellings Huwan Delā Krus, Lagūna, Sebū and Manīla. With the exception of names and places, all words in the native alphabet must be written with their respective spellings with their designated diacritics.

=== Simplified ===

The '''Rinconada Simplified''' alphabet is just the same as the Philippine alphabet. It has 28 letters:

{|class="wikitable" style="border-collapse:collapse;"
|- 	 
|bgcolor="#EFEFEF" align="center" colspan="28" | '''[[Capital letters|Majuscule Forms]]''' (also called '''uppercase''' or '''capital letters''')

|}

The letters F, V and Z are included because they are native to other Philippine languages like [[Itawis]] and [[Ibanag language|Ibanag]]. Letters C, Ñ, and Q are also included, but their usages are limited to foreign names, Filipinized words of foreign origins or loans, especially from Spanish, English and Arabic.

The simplified alphabet doesn't use diacritics like the macron {{angle bracket|◌̄}} for stressed and long vowels, the circumflex {{angle bracket|◌̂}} for glottal stop, or the letters for velar nasal {{angle bracket|ŋ}}, schwa {{angle bracket|ə}}, or velar fricative {{angle bracket|ɣ}}, as they don't appear on a standard "qwerty" keyboard. The velar nasal {{angle bracket|ŋ}} is replaced by the digraph {{angle bracket|ng}}, and the two latter sounds can be replaced by {{angle bracket|o}} and {{angle bracket|h}}, {{angle bracket|w}}, and {{angle bracket|y}} respectively. But even with the absence of diacritics in the modern and simplified alphabet, pronunciations in the spoken language are not altered. Moreover, the long vowel sound in a word should not be omitted. One good example of this is "bə̄ət" (kind) and "bəət" (want/like). The word '''bə̄ət''' in the native alphabet is written as '''bəət''' in the simplified alphabet making the two words the same in spelling albeit with different meanings. In this case, the pronunciation of the words depends on their place and usage in a sentence. To avoid confusion and aid in ease of reading, it is strongly recommended to use the native alphabet in writing Rinconada Bikol.

There are no written records to indicate that Rinconada has native words for two-digit numbers (11 - 99). On the other hand, there is also no proof that the language has no indigenous words for those numbers. It is intriguing that Rinconada has native words for three-digit numbers (e.g. "sanggatos" for 100) but not for two digit numbers. Utilization and adaptation of foreign words via 333 years of Spanish colonization could be a reason why the native terminologies may not have been passed to the new generations. But a long established language needs a complete numbering system in words. Therefore, the reconstruction of words for 11-99 is necessary but needs to follow and retain the indigenous or original structural form of Rinconada's orthography.

=== Structure ===

The number words of 1 to 10 and 100 are all native Rinconada while numbers 11 to 99 are all reconstructed. However, the reconstructed numbers are based on the original structure. '''Sampōlô''' (number ten) or sampu in Filipino is the only two-digit number that has a native word with a perfect indigenous structural form. The evolution of the word "sampōlô" from "əsadnapōlô" follows the orthography of Rinconada and developed naturally over the years.
Being said, it is imperative that all reconstructed numbers must follow the same format of number 10.

The word sampōlô is derived from a portmanteau of the words əsad + na + pōlô (əsadnapōlô) which is the based tenth of one. In the evolution of this number, the schwa letter {{angle bracket|ə}} of {{angle bracket|əsadnapōlô}} became silent and so the word became "sadnapōlô". Same with other Philippine languages, /na/ is converted into /ŋ/, replaces the last consonant letter of the first word (which is /d/) and become the connector to the second word (which is pōlô) - thus, the letter /d/ is omitted and the word became "saŋ". The connector /ŋ/ becomes /m/ naturally if the next letter is /p/ or /b/ (which is also the case in other Philippine languages). So then, the word became '''sampōlô'''.

1. əsad + na + pōlô = əsadnapōlô&lt;br /&gt;
2. əsadnapōlô – /ə/  = sadnapōlô&lt;br /&gt;
3. sadnapōlô – /d/ = sanapōlô&lt;br /&gt;
4. {{IPA|/na/}} replaced by {{IPA|/ŋ/}} = saŋpōlô&lt;br /&gt;
5. {{IPA|/ŋ/}} replaced by {{IPA|/m/}} before {{IPA|/p/}} = sampōlô.

From sampōlô, all two-digit numbers were given a name that was copied from it. The number 40 (pampōlô) and 60 (nəmpōlô) follow the same exact format of sampōlô. The exception to the naming system of numbers is the number zero (0). Though zero (0) is single digit, there is no native word for it. Since sampōlô (10) is a combination of 1 and 0, the word pōlô was taken out from it to represent zero (0) rather than using "sīro" or "sēro". As a result, Rinconada has a complete basic set of numbers without using foreign words.

The number referenced in Php 356,817,142,590 can be translated into Rinconada Bikol as:&lt;br /&gt;
"'''Toloŋgatos limamnəm na bilyon, waloŋgatos sampitoŋ milyon, saŋgatos pamdarwaŋ rībo ag limaŋgatos yampōloŋ pīso'''."

In ENGLISH language it is:

"'''Three hundred fifty six billion, eight hundred seventeen million, one-hundred forty two thousand and five hundred ninety pesos'''."

In FILIPINO language it is:&lt;br /&gt;
"'''Tatlong daan limampu't anim na bilyon, walong daan at labing pitong milyon, sandaan at apatnapu't dalawang libo at limang raan siyamnapung piso'''."

*Rinconada numbers in words are very simple in structure. Translations are shorter than both Filipino and English languages.

[[File:Bikol languages.jpg|300px|thumb|Bikol languages locator|right|'''Coverage of Rinconada Bikol language''' (purple)&lt;br /&gt; '''Coverage of Albay Bikol languages:''' &lt;br /&gt; Buhinon Bikol (dark blue) &lt;br /&gt; Libon Bikol (violet)&lt;br /&gt; West Miraya Bikol (light blue) &lt;br /&gt; East Miraya Bikol (blue-gray)]]

Although properly considered separate languages, speakers of Rinconada Bikol or Rinconada can communicate with [[Albay Bicolano|Albay Bikol]] speakers with ease and without code switching. A student from Ligao City (West Miraya speaker) studying in a university in Iriga City can understand Rinconada (any variant) and can be understood by Rinconada speakers as well. The same thing will happen if a local tourist from Rinconada visits the Cagsawa Ruins in [[Albay Province|Albay]] or visits Donsol, Sorsogon (East Miraya speaker) for the annual whale shark sightings. The difference between Rinconada and [[Albay Bicolano|Albay Bikol]] (both are included in Inland Bikol group) is comparable to [[German language|German]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]], while the differences between variants are comparable to those between English US, English British and English Australian. The mutual intelligibility of Rinconada and Albay Bikol is 80% to 85%, while intelligibility between variants is 95% to 98%.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Status ==
Rinconada Bikol is a minority language in the Bicol region despite having hundreds of thousands of speakers. It is currently not used in commercial media (print, radio, television) despite the fact that there are numerous prominent Rinconada speakers in the music and entertainment industry, media, and Philippine politics. It is not among the recognized regional languages in the Philippines and remains unknown to many Filipinos as it is poorly documented, researched and promoted.

Currently, the major obstacle to the diffusion of the usage and teaching of Rinconada is the lack of written material in Rinconada Bikol language, namely books, newspapers, software, magazines, etc. Thus, Rinconada, along with other [[Inland Bikol languages]] and the minor indigenous languages of Bicol region, remains essentially a [[spoken language]].

Due to everyday exposure of younger generations to Filipino/Tagalog and English languages in mass media and social networking sites, native words that are rarely used are now disappearing and being replaced by their counterparts from other languages. If cannot be salvaged by any means, this trend is more likely to continue and might endanger the language in the near future.

=== Publication ===

The only dictionary written for this language is ''Rinconada: Bikol-Filipino-English Phrasebook: with Mini-dictionary'' (2001) of Jason Lobel and Grace Bucad of Nabua, Camarines Sur. Several books were successfully created and published by native speakers and non-speakers alike. Some were published by Frank Peñones, Jason Chancoco, Rizaldy Manrique, Jonher Cañeba and Kristian Cordero of Iriga City. In 2004, the ''Ragang Rinaranga: mga rawitdawit'' which was published by Frank Peñones is the first anthology written in Rinconada Bikol.

On June 25, 2013, The Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges (CSPC), a state college in [[Nabua, Camarines Sur]], established the ''Center for Rinconada Studies'' that will serve as the research center for Rinconada Bikol language and heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CSPC@30 Kicks Off|url=http://www.cspc.edu.ph/index.php/news-and-updates/204-cspc30-kicks-off CSPC@30 Kicks Off|accessdate=Nov 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern culture ==

In Bicol region, the language and its speakers earned the moniker: ''Pa-sādi pa-san, pa-sīni pa-sīton'', that literally means 'will go here will go there, will go here will go there' (two different Rinconada words with the same meaning, which is a form of humor if said repeatedly). The moniker is the result of the prominence of Rinconada speakers in the region. This is due to the fact that a native speaker travelling in the region can easily be distinguished and identified because his language is different from the vast majority of Bicolanos, and to the fact that several prominent Bicolanos in the Philippines are of Rinconada heritage, gives the language and the speakers a "familiarity" to others. That makes one throwing a humorous line (the moniker) to a person telling him that he is a Rinconada speaker.

== Distribution ==

Rinconada is spoken by majority in Bula, Baao, Nabua, Balatan, [[Iriga]] and Bato in [[Camarines Sur]] (politically the 5th district of Camarines Sur province except the municipality of Buhi, where the majority speaks Buhinon). The language is dominant and the lingua franca in the southern half of the provincial capital town of Pili, the west barangays of Ocampo, and the far west barangays of Buhi; it can also be heard in neighboring places such as the northern barangays of [[Polangui]] and [[Libon, Albay|Libon]] in [[Albay]].

Based from the population of towns and city with a concentration of Rinconada Bikol speakers, the total number is 479,208 or almost half a million. This number is based from the population of the fifth district of [[Camarines Sur]] (Rinconada) and neighboring towns of Polangui and Pili, in which, Rinconada Bikol is their de facto daily language. Moreover, the total number does not include speakers outside Rinconada area. Some linguists place the native speaker population at 600,000 (estimate) because there are many speakers of this language outside the region who left in search for better job opportunities. Example of this are the Filipinos enlisted in US Navy that comes from Nabua, Camarines Sur which comprised the 10% of all Filipino US Servicemen. Most of these Rinconada speakers are now residing mostly in San Diego, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&amp;dat=19830425&amp;id=qapdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Vl0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1421,3747010|title=Filipino Retiress Live Good Life|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''salon''' is a gathering of people under the roof of an inspiring host, held partly to amuse one another and partly to refine the taste and increase the knowledge of the participants through conversation. These gatherings often consciously followed [[Horace]]'s definition of the aims of poetry, "either to please or to educate" (Latin: ''aut delectare aut prodesse''). Salons, commonly associated with French literary and philosophical movements of the 17th and 18th centuries, were carried on until as recently as the 1940s in urban settings.

==Overview==
The salon was an Italian invention of the 16th century, which flourished in France throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. The salon continued to flourish in Italy throughout the 19th century. In 16th-century Italy, some brilliant circles formed in the smaller courts which resembled salons, often galvanized by the presence of a beautiful and educated patroness such as [[Isabella d'Este]] or [[Elisabetta Gonzaga]]. 

One important place for the exchange of ideas was the salon. The word ''salon'' first appeared in France in 1664 (from the Italian word ''salone'', itself from ''sala'', the large reception hall of Italian mansions).  Literary gatherings before this were often referred to by using the name of the room in which they occurred, like ''[[Cabinet_(room)|cabinet]]'', ''réduit'', ''ruelle'' and ''alcôve''.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} ''Dictionnaire des lettres françaises: le XVIIe siècle'', revised edition by Patrick Dandrey, ed. Fayard, Paris, 1996, p. 1149.  {{ISBN|2-253-05664-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the end of the 17th century, these gatherings were frequently held in the bedroom (treated as a more private form of drawing room):&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, Nicole, ''Madame de Rambouillet ou la magicienne de la Chambre bleue'', Fayard, Paris, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; a lady, reclining on her bed, would receive close friends who would sit on chairs or stools drawn around. This practice may be contrasted with the greater formalities of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s ''[[Levée (ceremony)|petit lever]]'', where all stood. ''Ruelle'', literally meaning "narrow street" or "lane", designates the space between a bed and the wall in a bedroom; it was used commonly to designate the gatherings of the "[[précieuses]]", the intellectual and literary circles that formed around women in the first half of the 17th century. The first renowned salon in France was the [[Hôtel de Rambouillet]] not far from the [[Palais du Louvre]] in [[Paris]], which its hostess, Roman-born [[Catherine de Vivonne, marquise de Rambouillet]] (1588–1665), ran from 1607 until her death.&lt;ref&gt;Kale, Steven. ''French Salons : High Society and Political Sociability from the Old Regime to the revolution of 1848.'' Baltimore : The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004. p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lenotre, G. ''Le Château de Rambouillet, six siècles d'Histoire'', Calmann-Lévy, Paris, 1930. New publication, Denoël, Paris, 1984, chapter: ''Les précieuses'', pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; She established the rules of etiquette of the salon which resembled the earlier codes of Italian chivalry.

== History of the salon ==

The history of the salon is far from straightforward. The salon has been studied in depth by a mixture of [[feminist]], [[Marxist]], [[cultural]], social and [[intellectual]] historians. Each of these methodologies focuses on different aspects of the salon, and thus have varying analyses of its importance in terms of [[French history]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] as a whole

Major historiographical debates focus on the relationship between the salons and the [[public sphere]], as well as the role of women within the salons.[[File:Literarysalonpindropstudio.jpg|thumb|Pin Drop Studio - modern-day salon set in unusual venues in London, Paris, New York &amp; Los Angeles. Simon Oldfield hosting in London.|273x273px]]Breaking down the salons into historical periods is complicated due to the various historiographical debates that surround them. Most studies stretch from the early 16th century up until around the end of the 18th century. Goodman is typical in ending her study at the French Revolution where, she writes: 'the literary public sphere was transformed into the political public'.&lt;ref&gt;Dena Goodman, ''The Republic of Letters: A Cultural History of the French Enlightenment'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1994), p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Kale is relatively alone in his recent attempts to extend the period of the salon up until Revolution of 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Kale, ''French Salons: High Society and Political Sociability from the Old Regime to the Revolution of 1848'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A whole world of social arrangements and attitude supported the existence of French salons: an idle aristocracy, an ambitious middle class, an active intellectual life, the social density of a major urban center, sociable traditions, and a certain aristocratic feminism. This world did not disappear in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the 1940s salons hosted by [[Gertrude Stein]] gained notoriety for including [[Pablo Picasso]] and other twentieth-century luminaries like [[Alice B. Toklas]].

== Salons from around the world ==
Salon sociability quickly spread through Europe. In the 18th and 19th centuries, many large cities in Europe held salons along the lines of the Parisian models.

===Belgium===
Prior to the formation of Belgium, [[Béatrix de Cusance]] hosted a salon in [[Brussels]] in what was then the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in the mid 17th-century. In the late 18th-century, the political salon of [[Anne d'Yves]] played a role in the [[Brabant Revolution]] of 1789.

In [[Belgium]], the 19th century salon hosted by [[Constance Trotti]] attracted cultural figures, the Belgian aristocracy and members of the French exiled colony.&lt;ref&gt;Éliane Gubin (2006) (French). ''Dictionnaire des femmes belges: XIXe et XXe siècles.'' Lannoo Uitgeveri. {{ISBN|9782873864347}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Salon de Madame Geoffrin.jpg|thumb|A Reading in the Salon of Mme Geoffrin, 1755]]

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]], the salon culture was adopted during the 18th century. [[Christine Sophie Holstein]] and [[Charlotte Schimmelman]] were the most notable hostesses, in the beginning and in the end of the 18th century respectively, both of whom were credited with political influence.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon. KVinfo.dk&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Danish Golden Age]] in the late 18th century and early 19th century, the literary salon played a significant part in Danish culture life, notably the literary salons arranged by [[Friederike Brun]] at [[Sophienholm]] and that of [[Kamma Rahbek]] at [[Bakkehuset]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Germany===
In Germany, the most famous were held by Jewish ladies, such as [[Henriette Herz]], [[Sara Grotthuis]], and [[Rahel Varnhagen]], and in Austria in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by two prominent Jewish Patrons of the Arts: Adele Bloch-Bauer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuegalerie.org/museum/press-releases/klimt-bloch-bauer|title=Neue Galerie New York|first=Neue Galerie New|last=York|date=|website=neuegalerie.org|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018093302/http://www.neuegalerie.org/museum/press-releases/klimt-bloch-bauer|archivedate=18 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Berta Zuckerkandl]]. In Spain, by [[María del Pilar Teresa Cayetana de Silva y Álvarez de Toledo, 13th Duchess of Alba]] at the end of the 18th century; and in Greece by [[Alexandra Mavrokordatou]] in the 17th century.

Increasingly emancipated German-speaking Jews wanted to immerse themselves in [[Germany]]'s rich cultural life. However, individual Jews were faced with a dilemma: they faced new opportunities, but without the comfort of a secure community. For Jewish women, there was an additional issue. German society imposed the usual gender role restrictions ''and'' antisemitism, so cultivated Jewish women tapped into the cultural salon. But from 1800 on, salons performed a political and social miracle.&lt;ref&gt;Webberley, Helen, "Cultural Salons and Jewish Women in 19th Century Berlin", ''Limmud Oz Conference'' Sydney, July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The salon allowed Jewish women to establish a venue in their homes in which Jews and non-Jews could meet in relative equality. Like-minded people could study art, literature, philosophy or music together. This handful of educated, acculturated Jewish women could escape the restrictions of their social ghetto. Naturally the women had to be in well-connected families, either to money or to culture. In these mixed gatherings of nobles, high civil servants, writers, philosophers and artists, Jewish salonnières created a radical vehicle for democratisation, providing a context in which patrons and artists freely exchanged ideas. Henriette Lemos Herz, Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, Dorothea Mendelssohn Schlegel, Amalie Wolf Beer and at least twelve other salonnières achieved fame and admiration.

===Great Britain===
In [[18th century Britain|18th century]] England, salons were held by [[Elizabeth Montagu]], in whose salon the expression [[blue stockings]] originated, and who created the [[Blue Stockings Society (England)|Blue Stockings Society]], and by [[Hester Thrale]]. In the 19th century, the Russian Baroness [[Méry von Bruiningk]] hosted a salon in [[St. John's Wood]], [[London]], for refugees (mostly German) of the [[revolutions of 1848]] (the [[Forty-Eighters]]). [[Clementia Taylor]], an early feminist and radical held a salon at [[Aubrey House]] in [[Campden Hill]] in the 1860s. Her salon was attended by [[Moncure D. Conway]],&lt;ref name="Conway2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Moncure Daniel Conway|title=Autobiography Memories and Experiences of Moncure Daniel Conway.

=== Italy ===
Italy had had an early tradition of the salon; [[Giovanna Dandolo]] became known as a patron and gatherer of artists as wife of [[Pasquale Malipiero]], the doge in Venice in 1457-1462, and the courtisan [[Tullia d'Aragona]] held a salon already in the 16th century, and in the 17th century Rome, the abdicated [[Queen Christina of Sweden]] and the princess Colonna, [[Marie Mancini]], rivaled as salon hostesses.

The tradition of the literary salon continued to flourish in Italy throughout the 19th century. Naturally there were many salons with some of the most prominent being hosted by [[Clara Maffei]] in Milan, [[Emilia Peruzzi]] in Florence and [[Olimpia Rossi Savio]] in Turin. The salons attracted countless outstanding 19th-century figures including the romantic painter [[Francesco Hayez]], composer Giuseppe Verdi and naturalist writers [[Giovanni Verga]], [[Bruno Sperani]] and [[Matilde Serao]]. The salons served a very important function in 19th-century Italy, as they allowed young attendees to come into contact with more established figures. They also served as a method of avoiding government censorship, as a public discussion could be held in private. The golden age of the salon in Italy could be said to coincide with the pre-unification period, after which the rise of the newspaper replaced the salon as the main place for the Italian public to engage in conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romani|first=Gabriela|title=A room with a view: interpreting the Ottocento through the literary salon. |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/A+room+with+a+view%3A+interpreting+the+Ottocento+through+the+literary...-a0178121021|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most sensitive issues were discussed there, as well as literary topics. Mariquita Sánchez is widely remembered in the Argentine historical tradition because the [[Argentine National Anthem]] was sung for the first time in her house, on 14 May 1813.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Seamos libres y lo demás no importa nada |trans-title=Let us be free and nothing else matters |last=Galasso |first=Norberto |authorlink=Norberto Galasso |year=2000 |publisher=Colihue |location=Buenos Aires |language=Spanish |isbn=978-950-581-779-5 |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
In [[Poland]], the duchess Sieniawska held a salon in the end of the 17th century. They became very popular there during the 18th century. The most renowned were the [[Thursday Dinners]] of King [[Stanisław II Augustus]] at the end of the 18th century, and the most notable ''salonnières'' were [[Zofia Lubomirska]] and [[Elżbieta Czartoryska (1736–1816)|Izabela Czartoryska]].

===Russia===
The salon culture was introduced to Imperial Russia during the Westernization Francophile culture of the Russian aristocracy in the 18th-century. During the 19th-century, several famous salon functioned hosted by the nobility in Saint Petersburg and Moscow, among the most famed being the literary salon of [[Zinaida Volkonskaya]] in 1820s Moscow.

===Sweden===

In Sweden, the salon developed during the late 17th century and flourished until the late 19th century. During the 1680s and 1690s, the salon of countess [[Magdalena Stenbock]] became a meeting where foreign ambassadors in Stockholm came to make contacts, and her gambling table was described as a center of Swedish foreign policy.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Norrhem, Svante: Kvinnor vid maktens sida : 1632-1772 [Women by the side of power: 1632-1772] (2007) Lund (Nordic Academic Press) (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Swedish [[age of liberty]] (1718-1772), women participated in political debate and promoted their favorites in the struggle between the 
[[Caps (party)]] and the [[Hats (party)]] through political salons.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;     These forums were regarded influential enough for foreign powers to engage some of these women as agents to benefit their interests in Swedish politics.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
The arguably most noted political salonniére of the Swedish age of liberty was countess [[Hedvig Catharina De la Gardie (1695–1745)]], whose salon has some time been referred to as the first in Sweden, and whose influence on state affairs exposed her to libelous pamphlets and made her a target of [[Olof von Dahlin]]'s libelous caricature of the political salon hostess in 1733.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; [[Magdalena Elisabeth Rahm]] was attributed to have contributed to the realization of the [[Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743)]] through the campaign for the war she launched in her salon.&lt;ref&gt;Magdalena Elisabeth Rahm i Wilhelmina Stålberg, Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor (1864)&lt;/ref&gt;  
Outside of politics, [[Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht]] acted as the hostess of the literary academy ''[[Tankebyggarorden]]'' and [[Anna Maria Lenngren]] did the same for the [[Royal Swedish Academy]].

During the reign of [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustavian age]], the home of [[Anna Charlotta Schröderheim]] came to be known as a center of opposition. Salon hostesses were still attributed influence in politic affairs in the first half of the 19th century, which was said of both [[Aurora Wilhelmina Koskull]]&lt;ref&gt;Personhistorisk tidskrift 1898-1899, s. 174-175&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1820s as well as [[Ulla De Geer]] in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Carl De Geer, urn:sbl:17344, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av B. Boethius. Herbert Lundh.), hämtad 2013-10-28&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, however, the leading salon hostesses in Sweden became more noted as the benefactors of the arts and charity than with politics. From 1820 and two decades onward, [[Malla Silfverstolpe]] became famous for her Friday nights salon in Uppsala, which became a center of the Romantic era in Sweden and, arguably the most famed literary salon in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Österberg, Carin et al., Svenska kvinnor: föregångare, nyskapare. Lund: Signum 1990. ({{ISBN|91-87896-03-6}})&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1860s and 1870s, the ''Limnell Salon'' of the rich benefactor [[Fredrika Limnell]] in Stockholm came to be a famous center of the Swedish cultural elite, were especially writers gathered to make contact with wealthy benefactors,&lt;ref&gt;C Fredrika Limnell, urn:sbl:10390, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Sven Erik Täckmark), hämtad 2015-03-15.&lt;/ref&gt; a role which was eventually taken over by the ''Curman Receptions'' of [[Calla Curman]] in the 1880s and 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Calla Curman (f. Lundström), urn:sbl:15740, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Gurli Linder.), hämtad 2015-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
In [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] or [[Latin America]], a [[tertulia]] is a social gathering with literary or artistic overtones. The word is originally [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and has only moderate currency in English, in describing Latin cultural contexts. Since the 20th century, a typical ''tertulia'' has moved out from the private drawing-room to become a regularly scheduled event in a public place such as a bar, although some tertulias are still held in more private spaces. Participants may share their recent creations ([[poetry]], [[short stories]], other writings, even artwork or songs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucm.es/info/hcontemp/madrid/ocio.htm#LAS%20TERTULIAS%20DE%20LOS%20CAF%C9S:%20LITERATURA%20Y%20POL%CDTICA.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, the salon culture was extant in the mid 18th-century, represented by [[Julie Bondeli]] in Bern and [[Barbara Schulthess]] in Zürich, and the salon of [[Anna Maria Rüttimann-Meyer von Schauensee]] reached in influential role in the early 19th-century.

In Coppet close to Geneva, the author [[Germaine de Staël]] hosted a salon which played a key role in the aftermath of the French Revolution and especially under Napoleon Bonaparte's Regime. De Staël is author of around thirty publication, from which ''[https://www.uni-due.de/lyriktheorie/texte/1813_stael.html De L'allemagne]'' (1813) was the most well-known in its time. She has been painted by such famous painters as [[François Gérard]] and [[Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]].

===United States===
[[Martha Washington]], the first U.S. [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], performed a function similar to the host or hostess of the European salon. She held weekly public receptions throughout her husband's [[Presidency of George Washington|eight-year presidency]] (1789–1797). At these gatherings, members of [[United States Congress|Congress]], visiting foreign dignitaries, and ordinary citizens alike were received at the executive mansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The First First Lady| website=George Washington's Mount Vernon| url=https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/martha-washington/the-first-first-lady/| accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, "society hostesses" such as [[Perle Mesta]] have done so as well. The Stettheimer sisters, including the artist [[Florine Stettheimer]], hosted gatherings at their New York City home in the 1920s and '30s. During the [[Harlem Renaissance]], [[Ruth Logan Roberts]], [[Georgia Douglas Johnson]] and [[Zora Neale Hurston]] hosted salons that brought together leading figures in African-American literature, and in the culture and politics of [[Harlem]] at the time.&lt;ref name="factsonfile"&gt;{{cite web |last=Alexander |first=Adele Logan |url=http://www.fofweb.com/activelink2.asp?ItemID=WE01&amp;iPin=AFEBW0637&amp;SingleRecord=True |title=Roberts, Ruth Logan |work=Religion and Community.

== Conversation, content and the form of the salon ==

The content and form of the salon to some extent defines the character and historical importance of the salon. Contemporary literature about the salons is dominated by idealistic notions of politesse, civilité and honnêteté, but whether the salons lived up to these standards is matter of debate. Older texts on the salons tend to paint an idealistic picture of the salons, where reasoned debate takes precedence and salons are egalitarian spheres of polite conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Sisley Huddleston, ''Bohemian, Literary and Social Life in Paris: Salons, Cafes, Studios'' (London: George G. Harrap, 1928)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, however, this view is rarely considered an adequate analysis of the salon.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Kale, ''French Salons, p. 5.''&lt;/ref&gt; Dena Goodman claims that rather than being leisure based or 'schools of civilité' salons were instead at 'the very heart of the philosophic community' and thus integral to the process of Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Dena Goodman, 'Enlightenment Salons: The Convergence of Female and Philosophic Ambitions' ''Eighteenth-Century Studies, Vol. 22, No. 3, Special Issue: The French Revolution in Culture'' (Spring, 1989), pp. 330&lt;/ref&gt; In short, Goodman argues, the 17th and 18th century saw the emergence of the academic, Enlightenment salons, which came out of the aristocratic 'schools of civilité'. Politeness, argues Goodman, took second-place to academic discussion.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', pp. 329-331&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Delille et Geoffrin.jpg|frame|"Abbé Delille reciting his poem, La Conversation in the salon of Madame Geoffrin" from [[Jacques Delille]], "La Conversation" (Paris, 1812)]]

The period in which salons were dominant has been labeled the 'age of conversation'.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetta Craveri, ''The Age of Conversation'' (New York: New York Review Books, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The topics of conversation within the salons - that is, what was and was not 'polite' to talk about - are thus vital when trying to determine the form of the salons. The salonnières were expected, ideally, to run and moderate the conversation (See Women in the salon). There is, however, no universal agreement among historians as to what was and was not appropriate conversation. [[Marcel Proust]] 'insisted that politics was scrupulously avoided'.&lt;ref&gt;Kale, ''French Salons'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggested that little other than [[government]] was ever discussed.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  The disagreements that surround the content of discussion partly explain why the salon's relationship with the [[public sphere]] is so heavily contested. Individuals and collections of individuals that have been of cultural significance overwhelmingly cite some form of engaged, explorative conversation regularly held with an esteemed group of acquaintances as the source of inspiration for their contributions to culture, art, literature and politics, leading some scholars to posit the salon's influence on the [[public sphere]] as being more widespread than previously appreciated.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Dena Goodman, ''The Republic of Letters: a Cultural History of the French Enlightenment'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1994), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Jürgen Habermas (trans. Thomas Burger), ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society'' (Camb., Mass.: MIT Press, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The salon and the 'public sphere' ===

Recent historiography of the salons has been dominated by [[Jürgen Habermas]]' work, ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'' (triggered largely by its translation into French, in 1978, and then English, in 1989), which argued that the salons were of great historical importance.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;  Theatres of conversation and exchange – such as the salons, and the [[English coffeehouses in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries|coffeehouses]] in England – played a critical role in the emergence of what Habermas termed the ''[[public sphere]]'', which emerged in ''cultural-political contrast'' to [[Court (royal)|court society]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, while women retained a dominant role in the historiography of the salons, the salons received increasing amounts of study, much of it in direct response to, or heavily influenced by Habermas’ theory.&lt;ref&gt;Joan B. Landes, Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1988); Goodman, ''The Republic of Letters; Erica Harth, ''Cartesian Women: Versions and Subversions of Rational Discourse in the Old Regime'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1992).''&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent defence of salons as part of the public sphere comes from Dena Goodman’s ''The Republic of Letters'', which claims that the ‘public sphere was structured by the salon, the press and other institutions of sociability’.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  Goodman’s work is also credited with further emphasising the importance of the salon in terms of French history, the [[Republic of Letters]] and the Enlightenment as a whole, and has dominated the historiography of the salons since its publication in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Kale, ''French Salons'', p. 238 n. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas’ dominance in salon historiography has come under criticism from some quarters, with Pekacz singling out Goodman’s ''Republic of Letters'' for particular criticism because it was written with ‘the explicit intention of supporting [Habermas’] thesis’, rather than verifying it.&lt;ref&gt;Jolanta T. Pekacz, ''Conservative Tradition In Pre-Revolutionary France: Parisian Salon Women'' (New York: Peter Lang, 1999) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory itself, meanwhile, has been criticised for a fatal misunderstanding of the nature of salons.&lt;ref&gt;Landes, ''Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution'', pp. 23-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The main criticism of Habermas’ interpretation of the salons, however, is that the salons of most influence were not part of an oppositional public sphere, and were instead an extension of court society.

This criticism stems largely from [[Norbert Elias]]’ ''The History of Manners'', in which Elias contends that the dominant concepts of the salons – politesse, [[civilité]] and [https://earlymodernfrance.org/journal/2011-volume-xiii-2-production/theory-and-practice-honnetete-jacques-boscs-lhonnete-femme-163 honnêteté] – were ‘used almost as synonyms, by which the courtly people wished to designate, in a broad or narrow sense, the quality of their own behaviour’.&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Elias (Trans. Edmund Jephcott), ''The Civilising Process: The History of Manners'', Vol. 1 (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1978), pp. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;  Joan Landes agrees, stating that, ‘to some extent, the salon was merely an extension of the institutionalised court’ and that rather than being part of the public sphere, salons were in fact in conflict with it.&lt;ref&gt;Landes, ''Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution'', pp. 23-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Erica Harth concurs, pointing to the fact that the state ‘appropriated the informal academy and not the salon’ due to the academies’ ‘tradition of dissent’ – something that lacked in the salon.&lt;ref&gt;Harth, ''Cartesian Women'', pp. 61-63.&lt;/ref&gt;  But Landes’ view of the salons as a whole is independent of both Elias’ and Habermas’ school of thought, insofar that she views the salons as a ‘unique institution’, that cannot be adequately described as part of the public sphere, or court society.&lt;ref&gt;Landes, Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Steven Kale, compromise by declaring that the public and private spheres overlapped in the salons.&lt;ref&gt;Kale, ''French Salons'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Antoine Lilti ascribes to a similar viewpoint, describing the salons as simply ‘institutions within Parisian high society’.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Lilti, ‘Sociabilité et mondanité: Les hommes de lettres dans les salons parisiens au XVIIIe siècle’ ''French Historical Studies'', Vol. 28, No. 3 (Summer 2005), p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debates surrounding women and the salon ===
[[File:Presumed_Portrait_of_Madame_Geoffrin.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Mme Geoffrin, salonnière, by [[Marianne Loir]] (National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, DC)]]
[[File:Belgiosjoso-detail from 764px.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Cristina Trivulzio Belgiojoso|Italian in exile, Princess Belgiojoso]] 1832, salonnière in Paris where political and other émigré Italians,  including composer [[Vincenzo Bellini]], gathered in the 1830s. Portrait by [[Francesco Hayez]]]] 
When dealing with the salons, historians have traditionally focused upon the role of women within them.&lt;ref&gt;Jolanta T. Pekacz, ''Conservative Tradition In Pre-Revolutionary France: Parisian Salon Women'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Works in the 19th and much of the 20th centuries often focused on the scandals and ‘petty intrigues’ of the salons.&lt;ref&gt;S. G. Tallentyre, ''Women of the Salons'' (New York: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1926) and Julia Kavanagh, Women in France during the Enlightenment Century, 2 Vols (New York: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1893).&lt;/ref&gt;  Other works from this period focused on the more positive aspects of women in the salon.&lt;ref&gt;Edmond et Jules Goncourt, ''La femme au dix-huitème siècle (Paris: Firmin Didot, 1862) and Paul Deschanel, Figures des femmes'' (Paris: Calmann-Lévy, 1900).&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, according to Jolanta T. Pekacz, the fact women dominated history of the salons meant that study of the salons was often left to amateurs, while men concentrated on 'more important' (and masculine) areas of the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Pekacz, ''Conservative Tradition In Pre-Revolutionary France'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians tended to focus on individual salonnières, creating almost a 'great-woman' version of history that ran parallel to the Whiggish, male dominated history identified by [[Herbert Butterfield]]. Even in 1970, works were still being produced that concentrated only on individual stories, without analysing the effects of the salonnières' unique position.&lt;ref&gt;Anny Latour (Trans. A. A. Dent), ''Uncrowned Queens: Reines Sans Couronne'' (London: J. M. Dent, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt; The integral role that women played within salons, as salonnières, began to receive greater - and more serious - study in latter parts of the 20th century, with the emergence of a distinctly feminist historiography.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn C. Lougee, ''Women, Salons and Social Stratification in Seventeenth Century France, pp. 3-7.''&lt;/ref&gt; The salons, according to Carolyn Lougee, were distinguished by 'the very visible identification of women with salons', and the fact that they played a positive public role in French society.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', pp. 3, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; General texts on the Enlightenment, such as Daniel Roche's ''France in the Enlightenment'' tend to agree that women were dominant within the salons, but that their influence did not extend far outside of such venues.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Roche (Trans Arthur Goldhammr), ''France in the Enlightenment'', (Cambridge, Massachusetts: HUP, 1998), pp. 443-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was, however, Goodman’s ''The Republic of Letters'' that ignited a real debate surrounding the role of women within the salons and the Enlightenment as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, ''The Republic of Letters'', pp. 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Goodman: ‘The salonnières were not social climbers but intelligent, self-educated, and educating women who adopted and implemented the values of the Enlightenment Republic of Letters and used them to reshape the salon to their own social intellectual, and educational needs’.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wealthy members of the aristocracy have always drawn to their court poets, writers and artists, usually with the lure of [[patronage]], an aspect that sets the court apart from the salon. Another feature that distinguished the salon from the court was its absence of [[social hierarchy]] and its mixing of different social ranks and orders.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Dena.''Enlightenment salons: The Convergence of Female and Philosophic Ambitions.'' Eighteenth-Century Studies, Vol. 22. 3, Special issue : The French Revolution in Culture. (Spring, 1989), p 338&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th and 18th centuries, "salon[s] encouraged socializing between the sexes [and] brought nobles and bourgeois together".&lt;ref&gt;Kale, Steven.''French Salons : High Society and Political Sociability from the Old Regime to the revolution of 1848.'' Baltimore : The Johns Hopkins University Press,2004. p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Salons helped facilitate the breaking down of social barriers which made the development of the enlightenment salon possible. In the 18th century, under the guidance of [[Madame Geoffrin]], Mlle de Lespinasse, and [[Madame Necker]], the salon was transformed into an institution of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Dena.''Enlightenment salons: The Convergence of Female and Philosophic Ambitions.'' Eighteenth-Century Studies, Vol. 22. 3, Special issue : The French Revolution in Culture. (Spring, 1989), p.331&lt;/ref&gt; The enlightenment salon brought together Parisian society, the progressive [[philosophes]] who were producing the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', the [[Bluestockings]] and other intellectuals to discuss a variety of topics.

== Salonnières and their salons: the role of women ==
At that time women had powerful influence over the salon. Women were the center of life in the salon and carried very important roles as regulators. They could select their guests and decide the subjects of their meetings. These subjects could be social, literary, or political topics of the time. They also served as mediators by directing the discussion.

The salon was an informal education for women, where they were able to exchange ideas, receive and give criticism, read their own works and hear the works and ideas of other intellectuals. Many ambitious women used the salon to pursue a form of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Bodek, Evelyn Gordon.''Salonnières and the Bluestockings : Educated Obsolescence and Germinating feminism,'' Feminist Studies, Vol. 3 No. 3/4 ( spring-summer, 1976), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the most famous 17th-century literary salons in [[Paris]] were the [[Hôtel de Rambouillet]], established in 1607 near the [[Palais du Louvre]] by the [[Madame de Rambouillet|marquise de Rambouillet]], where gathered the original [[précieuses]], and, in 1652 in [[Le Marais]], the rival salon of [[Madeleine de Scudéry]], a long time ''habituée'' of the Hôtel de Rambouillet. [[:fr:Bas-blueism|''Les bas-bleus'']], borrowed from England's "[[blue-stocking]]s," soon found itself in use upon the attending ladies, a nickname continuing to mean "intellectual woman" for the next three hundred years.

[[Image:FdeTroyLectureMoliere.jpg|thumb|300px|''A reading of [[Molière]]'', [[Jean François de Troy]], about 1728]]
Paris salons of the 18th century hosted by women include the following:

* [[Marie Thérèse Rodet Geoffrin|Madame Geoffrin]]
* [[Claudine Guérin de Tencin|Madame de Tencin]]
* [[Jeanne Quinault]], hostess of the Bout-du-Banc
* [[Louise Marie Madeleine Fontaine|Madame Dupin]]
* [[Françoise de Graffigny]], author of ''[[Letters from a Peruvian Woman|Lettres d'une Péruvienne]]''
* [[Jeanne Julie Eleonore de Lespinasse|Julie de Lespinasse]]: her chief draw was [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]], but "though the name of M. d'Alembert may have drawn them thither, it was she alone who kept them there."
* the [[Marie Anne de Vichy-Chamrond, marquise du Deffand|marquise du Deffand]], the friend of [[Horace Walpole]]
* the [[Anne-Thérèse de Marguenat-de-Courcelles|marquise de Lambert]]
* the [[Anne-Louise-Bénédicte de Bourbon-Condé, duchesse du Maine|duchesse du Maine]]
* [[Louise d'Epinay|Madame d'Épinay]]
* [[Madame Necker]], the wife of the financier [[Jacques Necker]]
* [[Madame Helvétius]], the wife of [[Claude Adrien Helvétius|Helvétius]]
* [[Madame de Condorcet|Sophie de Condorcet]], wife of the mathematician and philosopher [[Condorcet]], visited by foreign notables and French thinkers alike
* [[Madame Roland]], the political salon that was the resort of the [[Girondist]]s at the first stages of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]
*[[Madame Swetchine]], wife of General Swetchine
*[[Julie Talma]], the friend of [[Benjamin Constant]]

Some 19th-century salons were more inclusive, verging on the raffish, and centered around painters and "literary lions" such as [[Jeanne Françoise Julie Adélaïde Récamier|Madame Récamier]]. After the shock of the [[Franco-Prussian war|1870 Franco-Prussian War]], French aristocrats withdrew from the public eye. However, [[Mathilde Bonaparte|Princess Mathilde]] still held a salon in her mansion, rue de Courcelles, later rue de Berri. From the middle of the 19th century until the 1930s, a lady of society had to hold her "day", which meant that her ''salon'' was opened for visitors in the afternoon once a week, or twice a month. Days were announced in ''Le Bottin Mondain''. The visitor gave his visit cards to the [[Lackey (manservant)|lackey]] or the ''maître d'hôtel'', and he was accepted or not. Only people who had been introduced previously could enter the ''salon''.

[[Marcel Proust]] called up his own turn-of-the-century experience to recreate the rival salons of the fictional duchesse de Guermantes and Madame Verdurin. He experienced himself his first social life in ''salons'' such as [[Léontine Lippmann|Mme Arman de Caillavet]]'s one, which mixed artists and political men around [[Anatole France]] or [[Paul Bourget]]; [[Geneviève Halévy|Mme Straus]]' one, where the cream of the aristocracy mingled with artists and writers; or more aristocratic ''salons'' like [[Laure de Chevigné|Comtesse de Chevigné]]'s, [[Élisabeth, comtesse Greffulhe|Comtesse Greffulhe]]'s, Comtesse Jean de Castellane's, Comtesse Aimery de La Rochefoucauld's, etc. Some late 19th- and early 20th-century Paris salons were major centres for contemporary music, including those of [[Winnaretta Singer]] (the princesse de Polignac), and [[Élisabeth, comtesse Greffulhe]]. They were responsible for commissioning some of the greatest songs and chamber music works of [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]] and [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]].

Until the 1950s, some ''salons'' were held by ladies mixing political men and intellectuals during the IVth Republic, like Mme Abrami, or Mme Dujarric de La Rivière. The last salons in Paris were those of [[Marie-Laure de Noailles]], with [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Igor Markevitch]], [[Salvador Dalí]], etc., Marie-Blanche de Polignac ([[Jeanne Lanvin]]'s daughter) and Madeleine and [[Robert Perrier]], with [[Josephine Baker]], [[Le Corbusier]], [[Django Reinhardt]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Django Reinhardt - Swing De Paris. 6 Oct. 2012. Exhibit. La Cité de la musique, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of the word==
{{main|Paris Salon}}
The word '''salon''' also refers to art exhibitions. The [[Paris Salon]] was originally an officially sanctioned exhibit of recent works of painting and sculpture by members of the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]], starting in 1673 and soon moving from the [[Salon Carré]] of the [[Louvre|Palace of the Louvre]].

The name ''salon'' remained, even when other quarters were found and the exhibits' irregular intervals became biennial. A jury system of selection was introduced in 1748, and the salon remained a major annual event even after the government withdrew official sponsorship in 1881.

The '''Sittard dialect''' (''Zittesj'') is a [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] [[dialect]] spoken mainly in the Dutch city of [[Sittard]]. It is also spoken in [[Koningsbosch]] and in a small part of [[Germany]] ([[Selfkant]]), but quickly becoming [[Extinct language|extinct]] there. Of all other important Limburgish dialects, the dialect of Sittard is most closely related to that of the {{ill|Roermond dialect|nl|Roermonds}}.

==Characteristics==
The Sittard dialect belongs to {{ill|East Limburgish|nl|Oost-Limburgs}}, which means it has a [[postalveolar consonant]] at the [[onset (linguistics)|onset]] of words beginning with [[consonant cluster|clusters]] such as ''sl'' and ''st'', in contrast with other variants of Limburgish such as [[Maastrichtian dialect|Maastrichtian]] and in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. 

The most important characteristic which distinguishes the dialect of Sittard from adjacent Limburgish dialects is the occurrence of the [[diphthong]]s ''ei'' and ''ou'', instead of ''ee'' and ''oo'' in words such as ''neit'' ("not"), ''veil'' ("fall") ''beier'' ("beer") and ''awd'' ("old"). This phenomenon was first examined thoroughly in the first half of the 1940s by [[Willy Dols]], who showed that this Sittard diphthongization typically occurred in [[syllable]]s with a [[Limburgish language#Tone|push tone]]. New research at the beginning of the 21st century has shown that the diphthongization once served to emphasize the difference in [[vowel length]] which distinguishes syllables with a push tone from those with a dragging tone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.let.ru.nl/gep/carlos/dols43.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:to2_2VwDsyQJ:www.let.ru.nl/gep/carlos/dols43.pdf+over+het+waarom+van+de+sittardse&amp;hl=nl&amp;gl=nl&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiOV3MTy_q5cGmT-wwKALe2b0qpGlUt3pnW7Gio-7vu_jcsF-V7Ym5emiU3C4GLpqSHjbj2JvQVJNeNAYe5YY5vJRRbqlbpmRDpPYhWUKuO6I4N_40YWBWNeVl7GPagRT1Yi9G-&amp;sig=AHIEtbQ4Do4xZ_O_YoJACguzlXVxHpDCGQ Carlos Gussenhoven Over het waarom van de Sittardse diftongering Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen in Dutch]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Street-sheet-saleswoman-crop.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A street newspaper vendor, selling ''[[Street Sheet]]'', in [[San Francisco]]]]

'''Street newspapers''' (or '''street papers''') are [[newspaper]]s or [[magazines]] sold by [[homelessness|homeless]] or [[poverty|poor]] individuals and produced mainly to support these populations.  Most such newspapers primarily provide coverage about homelessness and poverty-related issues, and seek to strengthen social networks within homeless communities. Street papers aim to give these individuals both employment opportunities and a voice in their community.  In addition to being sold by homeless individuals, many of these papers are partially produced and written by them.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries several publications by charity, religious, and labor organizations tried to draw attention to the homeless, but street newspapers only became common after the founding of New York City's ''[[Street News]]'' in 1989.  Similar papers are now published in over 30 countries, with most located in the United States and Western Europe. They are supported by governments, charities, and coalitions such as the [[International Network of Street Papers]] and the [[North American Street Newspaper Association]].  Although street newspapers have multiplied, many still face challenges, including funding shortages, unreliable staff and difficulty in generating interest and maintaining an audience.

Street newspapers are sold mainly by homeless individuals, but the newspapers vary in how much content is submitted by them and how much of the coverage pertains to them: while some papers are written and published mainly by homeless contributors, others have a professional staff and attempt to emulate  mainstream publications.  These differences have caused controversy among street newspaper publishers over what type of material should be covered and to what extent the homeless should participate in writing and production.  One popular street newspaper, ''[[The Big Issue]]'', has been a focus of this controversy because it concentrates on attracting a large readership through coverage of mainstream issues and [[popular culture]], whereas other newspapers emphasize homeless advocacy and social issues and earn less of a profit.

=== Historical foundations ===
Although the modern street newspaper began with the 1989 publication of ''[[Street News]]'' in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;{{cite web | last=Harman | first=Danna | date=17 November 2003 | accessdate=13 January 2009 | work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1117/p13s01-lihc.html | title=Read all about it: street papers flourish across the US}} [http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1117/p13s01-lihc.htm Archived version]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web | last=Boukhari | first=Sophie | title=The press takes to the street | url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-54237636/the-press-takes-to-the-street | publisher=[[UNESCO]] | work=[[The UNESCO Courier]] | year=1999 | accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Street Sheet in San Francisco, 1989, newspapers sold by the poor and homeless to generate income and to bring attention to social problems date back to the late 19th century; [[journalism]] scholar Norma Fay Green has cited ''[[The War Cry]]'', created by the [[Salvation Army]] in [[London]] in 1879, as an early form of "dissident, underground, alternative publication".&lt;ref name=Howley62&gt;{{Harvnb|Howley|2005|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The War Cry'' was sold by [[Officer of The Salvation Army|Salvation Army officers]] and the [[working poor]] to draw people's attention to the poor living conditions of these individuals. Another precursor to the modern street newspaper was [[Cincinnati]]'s&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/7423/streetpapers.html | last=Dodge | first=Chris | year=1999 | title=Words on the Street: Homeless People's Newspapers | journal=American Libraries | accessdate=15 April 2009 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/7423/streetpapers.html&amp;date=2009-03-17+09:45:51 | archivedate=2009-03-17 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heinz534/&gt; ''[[Hobo News]]'', which ran from 1915 to 1930&lt;ref group=note&gt;Another author claims the paper had a shorter lifespan, running "from the late 1910s to the early 1920s" {{Harv|Heinz|2004|p=534}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and featured writing from prominent labor and social activists as well as [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members, alongside contributions of oral history, creative writing, and artwork from [[hobo]]es, or itinerant beggars.&lt;ref name=Howley63&gt;{{Harvnb|Howley|2005|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most street papers published before 1970, such as ''[[The Catholic Worker]]'' (founded in 1933&lt;ref name=Heinz535/&gt;), were affiliated with religious organizations.&lt;ref name=NASNA&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasna.org/stpaper.html | publisher=[[North American Street Newspaper Association]] | title=About Street Papers | date=7 November 2008 | accessdate=12 February 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080225090632/http://www.nasna.org/stpaper.html |archivedate = February 25, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like workers' papers and other forms of [[alternative media]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, early street newspapers were often created because the founders believed mainstream news did not cover issues that were relevant to ordinary people.&lt;ref name=Heinz534&gt;{{Harvnb|Heinz|2004|p=534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern street newspapers ===
Modern street newspapers began to emerge in the United States in the late 1980s in response to [[Homelessness in the United States#1980s|increasing levels of homelessness]] and homeless advocates' dissatisfaction with the [[mainstream media]]'s portrayals of the homeless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Howley|2003|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green47&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|1998|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, many media outlets portrayed homeless people as being all criminals and drug addicts, and suggested that homelessness was a result of laziness rather than societal or political factors.&lt;ref name=Heinz535&gt;{{Harvnb|Heinz|2004|p=535}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, one motivation for the creation of the first street newspapers was to counter the negative coverage of homeless people that was coming from existing media.

''[[Street News]],'' founded in late 1989 in New York City, is frequently cited as the first modern street newspaper.&lt;ref name=review/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heinz536/&gt; While some small papers were already being published when it was founded, ''Street News'' attracted the most attention and became the "catalyst" for many other papers.&lt;ref name=enemy&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103184723/http://www.realchangenews.org/pastarticles/features/articles/fea_nasnaspch.html | archivedate=3 November 2005 | url=http://www.realchangenews.org/pastarticles/features/articles/fea_nasnaspch.html | date=14 September 1997 | last=Harris | first=Timothy | title=Strength in Unity: Street Newspaper Must Not Be Its Own Enemy | work=Founding Conference of the North American Street Newspaper Association | publisher=[[Real Change]] | accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many more street papers were launched in the early 1990s,&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sf-homeless-coalition.org/eng/about/#strshe | accessdate=13 January 2009 | title=Get Acquainted | publisher=[[Coalition on Homelessness, San Francisco]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010182419/http://www.sf-homeless-coalition.org/eng/about/#strshe | archivedate=10 October 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Big Issue History |url=http://www.bigissue.com/History_34.php |accessdate=13 January 2009 |publisher=[[The Big Issue]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301141303/http://www.bigissue.com/History_34.php |archivedate=1 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; crediting the high-profile New York paper as their inspiration, such as ''[[Spare Change News]]'' in [[Boston]] founded in 1992.

In the mid-1990s, coalitions were established to strengthen the street newspaper movement. The [[International Network of Street Papers|International Network of Street Papers (INSP)]] (founded in 1994) and the [[North American Street Newspaper Association|North American Street Newspaper Association (NASNA)]] (founded in 1997) aim to provide support for street papers and to "uphold ethical standards".&lt;ref name=Heinz539&gt;{{Harvnb|Heinz|2004|p=539}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the INSP was established to help groups that were starting new street newspapers, to bring more mainstream media attention to the street newspaper movement during the 1990s, and to support interaction and cross-talk between street paper publishers and staff from different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvs|last=Hanks|last2=Swithinbank|year=1999|loc=pp. 155–6|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The INSP and the NASNA voted to combine their resources in 2006;&lt;ref name=RealChange&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.realchangenews.org/2006/2006_06_28/directorscorner.html | date=5 October 2006 | accessdate=12 February 2009 | work=[[Real Change News]] | last=Harris | first=Timothy | title=Director's Corner|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060929140821/http://www.realchangenews.org/2006/2006_06_28/directorscorner.html |archivedate = September 29, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have  collaborated to found the [[Street News Service]], a project which collects articles from member papers and archives them on the internet.&lt;ref name=Heinz539/&gt;  National street paper coalitions have also been formed in Europe (there is a national coalition in [[Italy]], and the [[Netherlands]] has the ''[[Straatmedia Groep Nederland]]'').&lt;ref name=HanksSwith154&gt;{{Harvs|last=Hanks|last2=Swithinbank|year=1999|loc=p. 154|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most street newspapers have three main purposes:&lt;ref name=Heinz535/&gt;&lt;ref name=INSPconcept&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.street-papers.org/the-street-paper-concept/ | title=The street paper concept | publisher=[[International Network of Street Papers]] | accessdate=19 April 2009}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To provide income and job skills to the homeless and other marginalized individuals, who act as vendors of and often contributors to the newspapers
* To provide coverage of, and to educate the general public about, issues pertaining to homelessness and poverty
* To establish social networks within homeless communities and between homeless individuals and service providers

The defining characteristic of a street newspaper is that it is sold by homeless or marginalized vendors.&lt;ref name=denver&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westword.com/2009-02-19/culture/masterminds/ | accessdate=12 March 2009 | date=18 February 2009 | title=Meet the MasterMind Class of 2009 | work=[[Westword]] | last=Calhoun | first=Patricia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While many street newspapers aim to provide coverage of social issues and educate the public about homelessness, this goal is often secondary: many people who buy street newspapers do so to support and express solidarity with the homeless vendor, rather than to read the paper.&lt;ref name=Torck372/&gt;

The precise demographics of the readership of street newspapers is unclear. A pair of 1993 surveys conducted by Chicago's ''[[StreetWise]]'' suggested that the paper's readers at the time tended to be college-educated, with slightly over half being female, and slightly over half unmarried.&lt;ref name=Green42&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|1998|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most street newspapers operate by selling the papers to homeless vendors for a fraction of the retail price (usually between 10% and 50%), after which the vendors sell the papers for the retail price and retain all the proceeds from street sales.&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt;&lt;ref name=NASNA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sthlm/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Some street newspapers, however, work differently, having vendors pay back a portion of the proceeds after selling the paper {{Harv|Corporal|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The income vendors earn from sales is intended to help them "get back on their feet".&lt;ref name=NASNA/&gt; The purpose of requiring vendors to purchase papers up front and earn back the money by selling them is to help them develop skills in financial management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bigissue.com/How_We_Work_14.php | title=How We Work | publisher=The Big Issue | accessdate=10 February 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302154455/http://www.bigissue.com/How_We_Work_14.php | archivedate=2 March 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vendors for most newspapers are identifiable by badges&lt;ref name=KU/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About StreetWise Vendors |accessdate=13 January 2009 |url=http://streetwise.org/vendors.html |publisher=[[StreetWise]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209053959/http://www.streetwise.org/vendors.html |archivedate=February 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or messenger bags.&lt;ref name=KU/&gt; Many newspapers require that vendors sign a code of conduct&lt;ref&gt;Such as ''The Big Issue'': {{cite web | url=http://www.bigissue.com/How_We_Work_14.php | title=How We Work | publisher=[[The Big Issue]] | accessdate=13 January 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302154455/http://www.bigissue.com/How_We_Work_14.php | archivedate=2 March 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise "clean up their act".&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt;

Most street newspaper vendors in the United States and United Kingdom are homeless individuals, although in several other countries (especially in Europe) papers are mainly sold by [[refugee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvs|last=Hanks|last2=Swithinbank|year=1999|loc=pp. 153–4|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, not all vendors are homeless; some have stable housing situations but are unable to hold other jobs, while others started out homeless but were eventually able to use their income from sales to find housing.  In general, the major American street newspapers do not require prospective vendors to show proof of homelessness or poverty, and they do not require vendors to retire once they find stable housing.&lt;ref name=hsu&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2007-04-11/news/not-all-the-peddlers-of-seattle-s-homeless-paper-are-homeless.php | work=[[Seattle Weekly]] | title=Not All the Peddlers of Seattle's Homeless Paper Are Homeless | last=Hsu | first=Huan | date=10 April 2007 | accessdate=14 March 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109183034/http://www.seattleweekly.com/2007-04-11/news/not-all-the-peddlers-of-seattle-s-homeless-paper-are-homeless.php# | archive-date=2009-01-09 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, since 2008 there have been a growing number of vendors who are "newly needy"—only recently homeless, or with only temporary financial difficulty—as opposed to the "chronically homeless" who have traditionally made up the majority of the vendor force.  These vendors are often well-educated and have extensive work experience, but lost their jobs in the [[2008 financial crisis]].&lt;ref name=risingcirc&gt;{{cite news | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=12 April 2009 | accessdate=13 April 2009 | title=Extra, Extra!

Street papers start in a variety of ways. Some, such as ''[[Street Sense (newspaper)|Street Sense]]'',&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt; are begun by homeless or formerly homeless individuals, whereas others are more professional ventures.&lt;ref name=Sthlm/&gt; Many, particularly in the United States, receive aid from local government and charities,&lt;ref name=Sthlm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.larryville.com/index.php/local-news/local-news/16-local-news/91-sweets-on-the-street-change-of-heart-lawrences-homeless-newspaper-is-ten-years-old-this-year | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130502145031/http://news.larryville.com/index.php/local-news/local-news/16-local-news/91-sweets-on-the-street-change-of-heart-lawrences-homeless-newspaper-is-ten-years-old-this-year | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2 May 2013 | accessdate=12 February 2009 | date=7 December 2006 | last=Roy | first=M.G. | title=Sweets on the Street: Change of Heart, Lawrence's homeless newspaper is ten years old this year | work=The Lawrencian}} &lt;/ref&gt; and coalitions such as the International Network of Street Papers and the North American Street Newspaper Association provide workshops and support for new street papers.&lt;ref name=Heinz539/&gt; Many develop in a bottom-up fashion, starting up through volunteer work and "newcomers to the media business" and gradually expanding to include professionals.&lt;ref name=Sthlm/&gt;&lt;ref name=Green38&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|1998|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most papers, the majority of revenue comes from sales, donations, and government grants, while some receive advertising revenue from local businesses.&lt;ref name=Sthlm/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heinz538/&gt;&lt;ref name=Green41-2/&gt;  There has been some disagreement among street newspaper publishers and supporters over whether papers should accept advertising, with some arguing that advertising is practical and helps support the paper, and others claiming that many kinds of advertisements are inappropriate in a paper that is mainly geared towards the poor.&lt;ref name=Howley20039&gt;{{Harvnb|Howley|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific business models for street newspapers vary widely, ranging from vendor-managed papers that place the highest value upon homeless empowerment and involvement to highly professionalized and commercialized weeklies.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; Some papers (especially in Europe) operate as autonomous businesses, while others operate as parts of existing organizations or projects.&lt;ref name=HanksSwith155&gt;{{Harvs|last=Hanks|last2=Swithinbank|year=1999|loc=p. 155|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are papers that are very successful, such as the UK-based ''The Big Issue'', which in 2001 sold nearly 300,000 copies a week and earned the equivalent of 1 million&lt;ref&gt;https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/06771432/filing-history&lt;/ref&gt;[[United States dollar|USD]] in profits, but many papers sell as few as 3,000 copies a month and barely generate a profit at all for the publishers.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt;

=== Coverage ===
Most street newspapers report on issues regarding homelessness and poverty,&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; sometimes functioning as a main source of information on policy changes and other practical issues that are relevant to the homeless but may go unreported in mainstream media.&lt;ref name=Howley20038&gt;{{Harvnb|Howley|2003|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many feature contributions from the homeless and the poor in addition to articles by [[activist]]s and [[community organizer]]s,&lt;ref name=Howley63/&gt;&lt;ref name=NASNA/&gt; including profiles of individual street newspaper vendors.&lt;ref name=Heinz538/&gt;&lt;ref name=Howley20039/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|1998|pp=43–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the first edition of [[Washington, D.C.]]'s ''[[Street Sense (newspaper)|Street Sense]]'' included a description of a prominent homeless community, an interview with a congresswoman, an editorial about the costs and benefits of taking a job, several poems about homelessness, a how-to column, and a section for recipes.&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt; A 2009 issue of the [[Lawrence, Kansas]]-based ''[[Change of Heart (street paper)|Change of Heart]]'' included a story on the recent bulldozing of a homeless camp, a review of a book on homelessness, a description of the Family Promise organization for homeless support, and a list of community resources;&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Craig Sweets. ''Change of Heart'': A voice for Lawrence's Homeless People. Vol. 12, no. 1 (Winter 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; much of this content was submitted by the homeless.&lt;ref name=KU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansan.com/stories/2007/aug/23/newspaper/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20081201200413/http://www.kansan.com/stories/2007/aug/23/newspaper/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 December 2008 |work=[[University Daily Kansan]] |accessdate=13 January 2009 |title=Lawrence Streetpaper receives grant |last=Condron |first=Courtney |date=23 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The writing style is often simple and clear; social scientist Kevin Howley describes street newspapers as having a "native eloquence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Howley|2005|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Howley, street newspapers are similar to [[citizen journalism]] in that both are a response to the perceived shortcomings of the mainstream media and both encourage involvement by non-professionals.  A major difference between the two, however, is that the citizen journalism movement does not necessarily advocate a particular position, whereas street newspapers openly advocate for the homeless and poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Howley|2003|pp=1–2; 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most street newspapers, the [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based ''The Big Issue'' focuses mostly on celebrity news and interviews, rather than coverage of homelessness and poverty.&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt; It is still sold by homeless vendors and uses the bulk of its proceeds to support homeless individuals and advocacy organizations for the homeless, but the paper's content is mostly written by professional staff and geared towards a broad audience.&lt;ref name=review/&gt;  Because of its professional nature and high production values, it has been a frequent target of criticism in an ongoing debate between adherents of professional and [[grassroots]] ideals of how street newspapers should work.&lt;ref name=Sthlm/&gt;&lt;ref name=Howley200311/&gt;

=== Social benefits ===
In addition to providing some individuals with income and employment, street newspapers are intended to give homeless participants responsibility and independence, and to create a tight-knit homeless community.&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lee Stringer|Stringer, Lee]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=uX2Ol9BnT_gC ''Grand Central Winter: Stories from the Street''], 1st ed., New York : Seven Stories Press, 1998. {{ISBN|1-888363-57-6}}. Cf. Chapter 6, "West Forty-sixth Street, Winter 1989" which is about his experiences as a vendor of ''Street News''. "But it's not just the easy money. For most of us vendors this old Blimpie's was like our clubhouse. We lingered here when we came for papers, milled around, worked the winter chill from our bones, traded stories of the street."&lt;/ref&gt; Many offer additional programs to vendors, such as job training, housing placement assistance, and referral to other direct services. Others operate as a program of a larger social services organization—for instance, Chicago's ''StreetWise'' can refer vendors to providers of "drug and alcohol treatment, high school equivalency classes, career counseling, and permanent housing".&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt; Most are engaged in some form of organizing and advocacy regarding homelessness and poverty, and many function as "watchdogs" for the local homeless communities.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; Howley has described street newspapers as a means of mobilizing the networks of "formal and informal relationships that exist between the homeless, the unemployed, and the working poor, and shelter managers, healthcare workers, community organizers, and others who work on their behalf".&lt;ref name=Howley63/&gt;

=== Challenges and criticisms ===
[[File:EdMcLain.jpg|thumb|In 2005, [[Seattle]]'s ''[[Real Change]]'' redesigned its format and began to be published weekly, in attempt to avoid being seen as a "charity buy".&lt;ref name=readers/&gt;]]
In the early days of street newspapers, people were often reluctant to buy from homeless vendors for fear that they were being scammed.&lt;ref name=Green36&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|1998|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many of the more activist papers fail to sell well because their writing and production are perceived to be unprofessional and lackluster.  Topics covered are sometimes seen as lacking newsworthy content, and of little relevance or interest to  the general public or the homeless community.&lt;ref name=review&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hone&gt;"Homeless Journalists Hone Their Reporting Skills". American News Service, n.d. in {{Harvnb|Heinz|2004}}.&lt;br /&gt;"[Street newspapers] have traditionally been long on personal essays and short on hard news".&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizations in [[Montreal]]&lt;ref name=review/&gt; and [[San Francisco]]&lt;ref name=hone/&gt; have responded to these criticisms by offering workshops in writing and journalism for homeless contributors. Papers such as ''StreetWise'' have in the past been criticized as "grim" and for having vendors that are too loud and intrusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|1998|pp=40–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some newspapers sell well but may not be widely read, as many people will donate to vendors without buying, or buy the newspaper and then throw it away.&lt;ref name=Torck372&gt;{{Harvnb|Torck|2001|p=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=readers&gt;{{cite web | last=Green | first=Sara Jean | title=Real Change's transformation includes plan to reach readers | work=[[Seattle Times]] | url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20050201&amp;slug=homeless01m | date=1 February 2005 | accessdate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|1998|pp=36; 40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howley has described readers' hesitance or unwillingness to read the papers as "compassion fatigue".&lt;ref name=Howley200310/&gt; On the other hand, those papers that do sell well and are widely read, such as ''The Big Issue'', are often targets of criticism for being too "mainstream" or commercial.&lt;ref name=review/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Sally, "News is Uplifting for Homeless in N.Y.", ''The Boston Globe'', May 7, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Other difficulties street newspapers face include high [[turnover (employment)|turnover]] of "transient" or unreliable staff,&lt;ref name=review/&gt;&lt;ref name=Howley200310&gt;{{Harvnb|Howley|2003|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|1998|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; lack of adequate funding,&lt;ref name=review/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heinz538/&gt;&lt;ref name=Green41-2&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|1998|pp=41–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; lack of journalistic freedom for papers that are funded by local government, and, among some demographics, lack of interest in homeless issues.  For example, journalism professor Jim Cunningham has attributed the difficulties in selling [[Calgary]]'s ''Calgary Street Talk'' to the fact that the mostly [[middle-class]], conservative population has "not enough sensitivity to the causes of homelessness".&lt;ref name=review/&gt; Finally, [[anti-homeless legislation]] often targets street newspapers and vendors; for example, in New York City and [[Cleveland]], laws have prevented vendors from selling papers on [[public transit]] or other high-traffic areas, making it difficult for the papers ''Street News'' and ''[[Homeless Grapevine]]'' to earn revenue.&lt;ref name=Heinz538/&gt;

=== Differing approaches ===
[[File:Bigissue.jpg|right|thumb|In part because of its "flashy" design and high production values, ''[[The Big Issue]]'' has been a source of controversy among street newspapers.]]
Among proponents and publishers of street newspapers there is disagreement over how street newspapers should be run and what their goals should be, reflecting a "clash between two philosophies for advocating social change".&lt;ref name=Howley200311&gt;{{Harvnb|Howley|2003|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On one side of the debate are papers that seek to function like a business and generate a profit and a wide readership in order to benefit the homeless in a practical way; on the other are papers that seek to provide a "voice" to the homeless and poor without watering down their message for a broad readership.&lt;ref name=Howley200311/&gt;  Timothy Harris, the director of ''[[Real Change]]'', has described the two camps as "liberal entrepreneurial" and "radical, grassroots activist".&lt;ref name=enemy/&gt;

Controversy surrounding ''The Big Issue'', the world's most widely circulated street newspaper,&lt;ref name=review/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heinz536/&gt; is a good example of these two schools of thought.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Although ''The Big Issue'' has attracted attention and controversy because of its stature, it is not the only street newspaper that follows a business-oriented model.  Numerous street newspapers work in a similar way, with ''The Big Issue'' being the most well-known example of a whole category of street newspapers {{Harv|Green|1998|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Big Issue'' is mostly a tabloid covering celebrity news; while it is sold by the homeless and generates a profit that is used to benefit the homeless, the content is not written by them and there is little coverage of social issues that are relevant to them.&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt;  In the late 1990s when the London-based paper began making plans to enter markets in the United States, many American street newspaper publishers reacted defensively, saying they could not compete with the production values and mainstream appeal of the professionally produced ''The Big Issue''&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt;&lt;ref name=Howley200311/&gt; or that ''The Big Issue'' did not do enough to provide a voice to the homeless.&lt;ref name="Messman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hpn.asu.edu/archives/Feb98/0112.html|title=The Big Issue means big business as usual|last=Messman|first=Terry|date=10 February 1998|work=[[Street Spirit (newspaper)|Street Spirit]]|publisher=Homeless People's Network|accessdate=13 March 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630211539/http://hpn.asu.edu/archives/Feb98/0112.html|archivedate=30 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction to ''The Big Issue'' raised what is now an ongoing conflict between commercialized, professional papers and more grassroots-style ones,&lt;ref name=Heinz536&gt;{{Harvnb|Heinz|2004|p=536}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sthlm/&gt; with papers such as ''The Big Issue'' emulating mainstream papers and magazines in order to generate a large profit to invest in homeless issues and others focusing on political and social issues rather than on content that will generate money.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt;  Some street newspaper proponents believe that the primary aim of the papers should be to give homeless individuals a voice and to "fill the void"&lt;ref name=Green47/&gt; in mainstream media coverage, whereas others believe it should be to provide homeless individuals with jobs and an income.&lt;ref name=Howley200311/&gt;

Other frequent areas of disagreement include the extent that the homeless should participate in the writing and printing of street newspapers,&lt;ref name=review/&gt; and whether street newspapers should accept advertising  to generate revenue.&lt;ref name=Howley20039/&gt;  Kevin Howley sums up the division between different street newspaper models when he questions if it is "possible (or desirable for that matter) to publish a dissident newspaper—that is, a publication committed to progressive social change—and still attract a wide audience".&lt;ref name=Howley200311/&gt;

Turkish people were recruited to Austria as [[Gastarbeiter]] (guest workers) for the construction and export industries following an agreement with the Turkish government in 1964. From 1973 the policy of encouraging guest workers ended and restrictive immigration laws were introduced, first with the 1975 [[Aliens Employment Act]], setting quotas on work permits, and then the 1992 [[Residence Act]], which set quotas for residency permits without the right to work. A more restrictive system was put in place in 1997 and further limits imposed in 2006.

Since the 1970s Turks living and working in Austria have focused on family reunification and on seeking Austrian citizenship, for which they need to have lived in Austria for 10 years.

== Population ==
According to the 2001 census, there was 183,445 Turkish nationals living in Austria. According to the [[Minority Rights Group International]] many of the Turks living in Austria have been naturalized and the full community is estimated to number between 200,000 and 300,000. Turks are the largest single immigrant group, the leading group seeking Austrian citizenship, and account for the majority of Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Minority Rights Group International|title=Turks|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/1907/austria/turks.html|accessdate=2009-01-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429201941/http://www.minorityrights.org/1907/austria/turks.html|archivedate=2009-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;According to BBC the number of Turks in Austria are estimated to be around 350,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11725311|title=Turkey's ambassador to Austria prompts immigration spat|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in Belgium''' are [[European women]] who live in or are from [[Belgium]]. Generation after generation, Belgian women are able to close the "occupational gender gap". In younger generations, this is due to the increasing availability of "[[part-time]] jobs in services" for women. In 1999, the average earnings of a Belgian woman was 91 percent of the [[salary]] of a Belgian man. When not doing [[part-time]] jobs, Belgian women still "do more of the [[Domestic worker|domestic work]]", depending on the agreement between female and male [[Domestic partnership|partners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De Lannoy, Jean and Ruben A. Lombaert|title=Belgium|url=http://www.everyculture.com/A-Bo/Belgium.html|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural background==
{{See|Culture of Belgium|Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium}}
Belgian culture is complex, because it has both aspects that are shared by most Belgians regardless of the language they speak, as well as differences between the main cultural communities:  the Dutch-speaking [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and the French-speakers [[Walloons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/A-Bo/Belgium.html|title=Culture of Belgium - history, people, women, beliefs, food, customs, family, social, marriage|work=everyculture.com|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Flemish people|Flemish]] draw intensively from both the [[English-speaking culture]] (which dominates sciences, professional life and most news media) and the [[Culture of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], while French-speakers focus on cultural life in [[Culture of France|France]] and elsewhere in the [[Francophone|French-speaking world]], and less outside. Today, the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] is primarily French speaking, but is quite bilingual, and is also a cosmopolitan place. There is also a small German speaking community in the East of the country. Women's rights in Belgium have been influenced by a variety of factors, including local culture, and national laws and policies. Women obtained the right to vote first with restrictions in 1919, and on equal terms with men in 1948.&lt;ref name="idea.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idea.int/publications/voter_turnout_weurope/upload/chapter%204.pdf |title=inlay_eurpean 1-12.qxd |format=PDF |website=Idea.int |date= |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women obtained the right to stand for elections in 1921.&lt;ref name="idea.int"/&gt;

==Marriage and family life==
Like in most other European countries, [[family law]] has traditionally given legal authority to the husband; but has been reformed in the second half of the 20th century. The [[marital power]] of the husband was abolished in 1958, but property laws were reformed only in the 1970s, when legal gender equality between husband and wife was established.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History'', by Bonnie G. Smith, pp 332.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adultery]] was decriminalized in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.be/www/?MIval=/publications/viewPub.html&amp;COLL=S&amp;LEG=4&amp;NR=162&amp;VOLGNR=1&amp;LANG=fr|title=Document législatif n° 4-162/1|work=senate.be|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium]] was legalized in 2003. The [[divorce law in Belgium]] was liberalized in September 2007. In the 21st century, the link between [[marriage]] and [[fertility]] has decreased: in 2012, 52.3% of births were outside of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00018|title=Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table|work=europa.eu|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centrality of marriage in peoples' life is no longer so strong: in the European Values Study (EVS) of 2008, the percentage of respondents who agreed with the assertion that "Marriage is an outdated institution" was 34.3% in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zacat.gesis.org/webview/index.jsp?study=http%3A%2F%2F193.175.238.79%3A80%2Fobj%2FfStudy%2FZA4783&amp;variable=http%3A%2F%2F193.175.238.79%3A80%2Fobj%2FfVariable%2FZA4783_V252&amp;mode=documentation&amp;submode=variable&amp;top=yes&amp;language=en] See: Variable Description - Family - Q 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abortion laws in Belgium were liberalized in 1990.&lt;ref name="baudouin"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/05/world/belgian-king-unable-to-sign-abortion-law-takes-day-off.html|title=Belgian King, Unable to Sign Abortion Law, Takes Day Off|date=5 April 1990|work=The New York Times|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion is legal until the twelfth week of pregnancy,&lt;ref name="belgium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belgium.angloinfo.com/countries/belgium/abortion.asp|title=Living in Belgium|work=angloinfo.com|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is required for a woman to receive counseling at least six days prior to the abortion and to check in with her doctor to monitor her health in the weeks after the procedure.&lt;ref name="belgium" /&gt; Abortions at later stages are permitted for medical reasons.&lt;ref name="belgium" /&gt; The [[maternal mortality]] rate in Belgium is 8.00 deaths/100,000 live births (as of 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most Western countries, Belgium has to deal with low fertility levels and a [[sub-replacement fertility rate]]: the [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) is 1.7 children born/woman (est. of 2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is below the replacement rate of 2.1.

== Women in politics ==
The representation of women in [[Belgian Federal Parliament|parliament]] has been increasing steadily since 1995.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"Women in Parliament in 2007: The Year in Perspective." ''Ipu.org''. Inter-Parliamentary Union, 2008. Web. 24 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In lower or single Houses after parliamentary renewals in 2007, women have taken 55 seats to account for 36.7%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2014, that number rose slightly to 57 accounting for 38% in the lower or single House.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;"Women in National Parliaments." ''Women in Parliaments: World Classification''. 1 July 2017. Web. 24 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in upper houses of parliament in 2007 was 27 out of 71, which was 38%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That number rose to 30 women accounting for 50% total in the upper house in 2014.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Belgium has a law requiring political parties to nominate at least 33 percent women. The parties that do not meet the target face sanctions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Women in the workforce ==
Belgium, like neighboring Netherlands, has a strong tradition of women fulfilling a predominantly domestic role, rather than a professional one.&lt;ref&gt;http://aei.pitt.edu/4560/1/4560.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Catholicism]], the traditional [[religion in Belgium]], has supported different [[gender roles]] for men and women. However, from the 1990s onward, this has started to change. The occupational gender gap has been decreasing in recent years, especially among younger generations. However, the higher occupational rate of women is primarily due to an increase in part-time jobs. In 2011, 43.3% of employed women worked part-time, compared to only 9.2% of men.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/epo_campaign/130911_epo_country_profile_belgium.pdf|title=Gender equality|author=|date=|website=European Commission - European Commission|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a strong segregation by field, and there are less women in Belgium working in STEM and engineering than the EU average.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt;

The gender employment gap for highly educated women decreased to 7% in 2002, below the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] average.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/articles/gender-wage-gap-for-women|title=Gender wage gap for women {{!}} Eurofound|website=www.eurofound.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the overall employment rate for women aged 20–64 years is 63.0% compared to 72.3% for men (in 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=t2020_10&amp;language=en|title=Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table|author=|date=|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gender employment gap for highly educated women is smallest in [[Flemish Region|Flanders]] and largest in [[Wallonia]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1221">'''Zvakwana''' is an [[underground movement]] in [[Zimbabwe]], that came to light in 2004. Its name means "enough is enough" in the [[Shona language]], and in [[Sindebele language|Ndebele]] it translates to [[Sokwanele]]. (Sokwanele is also a part of the movement but appears to be more occupied with information dissemination).

Zvakwana appears to be responsible for clandestinely distributing resistance messages, graffiti, CDs of music, and [[condom]]s featuring their logo, a Z on a yellow background. They also run a [[website]] which the Zimbabwean government is trying to block from [[internet service provider]]s. 

Opposition party [[Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai|Movement for Democratic Change]] says they have no connection to Zvakwana, but share its values and support its efforts.
