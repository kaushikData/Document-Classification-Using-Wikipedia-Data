[[File:Kvindernes Udstilling 1895.gif|thumb|Sketch of the Women's Exhibition from ''Illustreret Tidende'']]
The '''Women's Exhibition from the Past and Present''' ({{lang-da|'''Kvindernes Udstilling fra Fortid og Nutid'''}}) held in [[Copenhagen]] in 1895 was an art and culture exhibition for women from the [[Nordic countries]]. Inspired by the [[1893 Chicago's World's Fair|1893 World's Fair]] in [[Chicago]], it was designed to demonstrate how far Nordic women had advanced in the areas of education, employment and art. The first of its kind in Europe, it was considered a great success.&lt;ref name=eg&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emmagad.dk/udstillinger/1895-kvindernes-udstilling-iii.html|title=Kvindernes Udstilling 1895|author=Hald, Tonny|publisher=Emma Gad|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/170/bio/1294/%20-/|title=Emma Gad (1852 - 1921)|author=Ludvigsen, Christian|publisher=Kvinfo|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Kvindeudstillingens-gamle-og-nye-koekken.jpg|thumb|Old and new kitchen exhibit]]
The Chicago World's Fair in 1893 had impressed Danish visitors with its [[The Woman's Building (Chicago)|Woman's Building]] containing presentations of art and literature. [[Sophie Oxholm]] (1848–1935), who had visited the exhibition, was obviously impressed by the exhibition, especially the show of Danish needlework. On her return to Denmark, she immediately brought a number of influential women together with a view to arranging a Nordic women's exhibition in Copenhagen the following year. Despite initial enthusiasm, as a result of budgetary and management problems, it was announced in February 1894 that the exhibition would not be held until 1895.&lt;ref name=eg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emmagad.dk/eg-omtale/omtale/2004-eva-lous.html|title=Eva Lous: Kvindernes Udstilling 1895|publisher=Emma Gad|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxholm, who experienced difficulty in managing the arrangements, gave up her position as head of the coordinating committee in early 1895. She was replaced by Bertha Buch of the [[Danish Women's Society|Women's Society]] but it was [[Emma Gad]] (1852–1921) who proved to be the most effective member. Appointed deputy chair, Gad managed to complete all the arrangements on time. These included selecting the site of the exhibition which was ultimately shared between the Industrial Association building (''Industriforeningen''), which had been built in connection with the 1872 Nordic Exhibition, and the premises of [[Den Frie Udstilling]]. It was therefore possible for the exhibition to open on 22 June 1895 in the presence of [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise]].&lt;ref name=eg/&gt;

==Exhibition==
[[File:Den-groenlandske-Afdeling-paa-Kvindeudstillingen enhanced.jpg|thumb|The Greenland exhibit]]
In addition to exhibits from Denmark, the exhibition contained areas specifically dedicated to the Danish provinces and overseas territories ([[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and [[Danish West Indies]]) as well as to Norway and Sweden. There are records of the 2,415 exhibits covering painting, curiosities (including items associated with celebrated women), arts and crafts, costumes, jewellery (including gold- and silverware), literature (manuscripts, journals and books) and appliances. There were also separate listings of exhibits relating to housekeeping, philanthropy, hygiene, education, household crafts (spinning and weaving, leather, wood, embroidery, silk painting, and [[whitework]]), music and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kb.dk/e-mat/dod/112308017118.pdf|title=Fortegnelse over Kvindernes Udstilling 1895|publisher=Nielsen &amp; Lydiche|year=1895|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Den Frie Udstilling building, there was a separate inventory of 301 artworks, paintings and sculptures, listed by artist.&lt;ref name=frie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunstbib.dk/samlinger/udstillingskataloger/samlingen/000084459|title=Kunst: Den frie Udstillings bygning|publisher=Nielsen &amp; Lydiche|year=1895|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key organizers==
The two women who were instrumental in organizing the exhibition were Sophie Oxholm and, above all, Emma Gad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/49591|title=Kvinnornas utställning i Köpenhamn|publisher=''Idun'' (Årg. 8, N:r 26)|date=28 June 1895|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome==
The Women's Exhibition was a great success. Not only was it appreciated in Denmark and beyond, it made a substantial profit. Gad had hoped the money could be used for an independent "Women's Building" (''Kvindernes Bygning'') with a meeting room, reading room, restaurant and accommodation for women from the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvindernesbygning.dk/|title=Kvindernes Bygning|publisher=Kvindernes Bygning|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work did not begin on the building until 1929. It was completed in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvindernesbygning.dk/historie|title=Kvindernes Bygnings historie|publisher=Kvindernes Bygning|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al-Nuʿmān ibn al-Mundhir''' ({{lang-ar|النعمان بن المنذر}}), known in [[Greek language|Greek]] sources as '''Naamanes''' ({{lang|grc|Νααμάνης}}) was a king of the [[Ghassanids]], a Christian Arab tribe allied to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The eldest son of [[al-Mundhir III ibn al-Harith]], he rose in revolt with his tribe after his father was treacherously arrested by the Byzantines in 581. After two years of revolt, seeking to reconcile himself with the Empire, he visited the new emperor, [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (r. 582–602), at [[Constantinople]]. Refusing to renounce his [[Monophysite]] faith, he was arrested and exiled to [[Sicily]], where his father had been banned earlier. This event marked the end of the Ghassanid control over the Byzantines' Arab ''[[foederati]]'' and the fragmentation of this strong [[buffer state|buffer]] against invasions from the desert.

[[Image:ConcoursdeEleganceLogo.PNG|thumb|Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance logo]]
The '''Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance''' is an automotive charitable event held each year during the second weekend in March at The [[Ritz-Carlton]] Amelia Island in [[Amelia Island, Florida]]. A ''[[The New York Times]]'' article about celebrity car ownership listed "the nation's top concours d'elegance: [[Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance|Pebble Beach in California]], [[Meadow Brook Concours d'Elegance|Meadow Brook in Michigan]], Amelia Island in Florida and the Louis Vuitton Classic in midtown Manhattan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Martin |first= Keith |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/25/automobiles/autos-on-friday-collecting-it-s-the-stars-cars-that-steal-the-scene.html |work= The New York Times |date= February 25, 2000 |department= Autos on Friday |title= Collecting; It's The Stars' Cars That Steal the Scene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{lang|fr|[[concours d'elegance]]}} ([[French language|French]], literally "a competition of elegance") is according to ''The New York Times'' writer Keith Martin like a "beauty pageant for rare and elegant cars".&lt;ref name=Gleam&gt;{{cite news |last= Martin |first= Keith |title= Where Old Cars Go to Gleam |work= The New York Times |date= May 19, 1999 |access-date= March 4, 2009 |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E1D81E3CF93AA25756C0A96F958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/A/Antiques}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each entry is rated for authenticity, function, history, style and quality of restoration by a team of judges that includes specialists for each car type. A perfect score is 100, but any imperfection, no matter how slight, requires a fractional point deduction. Classes are arranged by type, [[marque]], [[coachbuilder]], country of origin, or time period.

Judges select first-, second-, and third-place finishers for each class in the event, and the judges confer the best of show award on one car from the group of first-place winners. In addition, a group of honorary judges—typically individuals who have made significant contributions to the automotive industry or motorsports—give subjective awards to recognize standout vehicles regardless of class ribbons, as well as memorial awards created to honor automotive industry personages.

==History==
Businessman and car collector Bill Warner, a photographer and writer for ''[[Road &amp; Track]]'' magazine since 1971, founded the Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance in 1996 at the urging of other northeast Florida auto enthusiasts who wanted a classic car show in Florida like the [[Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance]] in California. Warner selected [[Community Hospice of Northeast Florida]], which had provided service to his parents as well as his wife, as the beneficiary of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Scanlan |first= Dan |url= http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/030903/dss_11942046.shtml |work= [[The Florida Times-Union]] |location= Jacksonville |date= March 9, 2003 |title= Full Force}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first event was held April 6, 1996 at [[Ritz-Carlton]] Amelia Island. Warner assembled a group of 163 cars and attendance was around 2,200.

By 1999 attendance had increased to 8,500; 205 cars were exhibited; and $268,000 was raised for Community Hospice. ''The New York Times'' assigned a reporter to write a story. In his full-page feature article, Keith Martin stated, "The Amelia Island event, which is sponsored by [[Mercedes-Benz]], is the only one in its region to aspire to the same standard of excellence (as the) Concours d'Elegance at Pebble Beach, in California, as well as the Louis Vuitton Classic at Rockefeller Center".&lt;ref name=Gleam/&gt;

Entrants submit an application for each car, and the Concours field is selected from each year's pool of applicants. Many collectors spend years and hundreds of thousands of dollars purchasing and restoring a car in hopes of being chosen. Once a car is accepted to the Concours, it cannot again be entered in the event for five years, with three exceptions; the ownership of the car has changed, the car has been restored, or if the featured marque is obscure, the Concours car selection committee can reach out to invite cars of varying restoration quality—or cars that have previously been entered in the Concours—in order to provide a healthy representation of the marque for exhibition.	

Many of the competing cars are valued in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, with some worth millions. For this reason, along with its  setting and amenities, the Amelia Island Concours is considered one of the premier concours in [[the world]].

==Events==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
Most of the owners display their cars because they want everyone who appreciates style and beauty to see their project. Most view the weekend as a social gathering rather than a special interest event. The organizers attempt to invite vehicles from  varying time periods so that spectators who prefer a certain style of car will always find several examples to examine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.autotraderclassics.com/car-article/Report%3A+2011+Amelia+Island+Concours+d%27Elegance-79951.xhtml |work= AutoTrader Classics |title= Report: 2011 Amelia Island Concours  d'Elegance |first= Brian |last= Medford |year= 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year's Amelia Island Concours honors an outstanding person from motorsports, a featured [[Marque]] (manufacturer) or theme, plus judging and awards for each class of the ''Field of Dreams'', the showcase exhibition. Events have included a golf tournament, automobile auctions, art and fashion shows, silent auctions of memorabilia, charity raffles and autograph sessions.

==Charitable contributions==
The non-profit Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance Foundation was formed in 2000 to organize and manage the workload of more than 300 volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Scanlan |first= Dan |url= http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/072800/bus_3656921.html |work= The Florida Times-Union |location= Jacksonville |date= July 28, 2000 |title= Non-Profit to Run Concours d'Elegance}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The proceeds of the Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance have helped support [[Community Hospice of Northeast Florida]] with total contributions of over $1.5 million through 2008. The event's goal is to raise at least $100,000 for Community Hospice each year. Other charities receiving funding include The Spina Bifida Association of Florida at Jacksonville, Shop with Cops, Duval County 4-H Foundation and the Navy Marine Corps Relief Society.

'''Avraham "Avi" Lanir''' (January 25, 1940 – October 1973) was a [[Lieutenant Colonel]] in the [[Israel Air Force]]. He was the highest ranking [[Israel]]i fighter pilot to fall into enemy hands. He was tortured to death by his [[Syria]]n captors.

==Biography==
Avraham Lankin (later Lanir) was born in 1940 in [[Herzliya]]. His parents Yaacov and Malka were active members in the British Mandate era militant group [[Etzel (Irgun Tzvai-Leumi)|Etzel]].  His father went on to become a senior member of the [[Shin Bet]]. His uncle, [[Eliyahu Lankin]], was the commander of the weapons ship ''[[Altalena Affair|Altelena]]''. Lanir studied at several schools, with the family following his father's employment relocations throughout Israel. In 1954, the family moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] in the framework of Lanir’s fathers work in the service of the state of Israel. When Avi Lanir was 17, he returned to Israel with his family and for the year which remained before his enlistment he studied electronics at the [[Israeli Air Force]]’s technical academy. In August 1962, Lanir married Michal Barzilai. The couple had two children, [[Noam Lanir|Noam]] and Nurit.

==Air force career==
Lanir enlisted in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] in 1959, training to become a fighter pilot. He flew the [[Dassault Mirage III]] with [[117 Squadron (Israel)|117 Squadron]] and on April 6, 1967, scored his first aerial kill in a major skirmish along the Syrian border which ended with the downing of six Syrian jets. Lanir, flying Mirage 60, downed a [[Syrian Air Force|SAF]] [[MiG-21]] with cannon fire after closing in to a distance of 200 meters. The MiG exploded and Lanir flew right through the fireball, covering his aircraft with soot. Initially blinded, enough soot was eventually blown off his canopy to afford Lanir a safe landing at [[Ramat David Airbase|Ramat David]]. The scorched aircraft earned the nickname "Black Mirage", and Lanir flew it once again during [[Operation Focus]] on June 5, 1967, when he participated in a strike against the Egyptian air base at [[RAF Fayid|Fayid]]. The aircraft was lost 2 days later over [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="AloniM1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bolt1" /&gt;

[[File:Hatzerim Mirage 20100129 2.jpg|thumb|Mirage (1)58, bearing 13 kill markings, at the [[Israeli Air Force Museum]] in Hatzerim. Lanir was flying this aircraft when he scored his third, and the aircraft's tenth, kill on October 12, 1973]]
After the [[Six-Day War]] Lanir converted to the [[Dassault Super Mystere]] which he flew as the senior deputy commander of [[105 Squadron (Israel)|105 Squadron]] during the [[War of Attrition]].&lt;ref name="attrition" /&gt;

In 1965 Lanir was sent to study electrical engineering at the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]], from which he graduated in 1969. He was thereafter appointed to test pilot the "Technolog," the prototype that preceded the [[IAI Kfir]].

In 1971, Lanir was assigned command of [[101 Squadron (Israel)|101 Squadron]], operating the Dassault Mirage out of [[Hatzor Airbase|Hazor]]. He scored his second aerial kill on November 9, 1972, downing a Syrian MiG-21 while flying Mirage 72.&lt;ref name="AloniM2" /&gt; On October 12, 1973, a week after the [[Yom Kippur War]] began, Lanir scored his third and last aerial kill, downing a Syrian [[MiG-17]] in the vicinity of [[Kuneitra]] while flying Mirage 58.&lt;ref name="myths" /&gt;

==Capture and death==
On October 13, 1973, Lanir was scrambled for a reconnaissance mission deep in [[Syria]]n territory. Lanir was not aware of the location of the mobile missile batteries that the Syrians had placed overnight, possibly due to not attending the morning squadron briefing. During his return to Israel, Lanir was caught in a missile ambush and his Mirage was hit in the rear, forcing him to eject. The wind carried the parachuting pilot back over the border into Syrian territory and he landed in the area of [[Mazra'at Beit Jinn]]. Israeli [[Armor Corps (Israel)|Armor Corps]] soldiers witnessed him land and attempted to rescue him, but he was captured by a Syrian jeep patrol that reached him first.&lt;ref&gt;Igal Sarna, ''The Man Who Fell Into a Puddle: Israeli Lives'', Vintage Books/Random House (2000) pages 144 through 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign press reports claimed that Lanir had information on Israel's nuclear program. According to [[Yuval Neeman]], then Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] delivered a message to [[Henry Kissinger]] stating that the Israeli government would be willing to relinquish the [[Mount Hermon|Hermon peak]] in return for the 28 Israeli pilots,{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} including Lanir, held captive by the Syrians. However, Lanir was tortured to death by his interrogators.&lt;ref name="Sarna p. 148"&gt;Sarna p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Rabinovich, The Yom Kippur War: The Epic Encounter That Transformed the Middle East, Random House/Schocken Books (2004) p.115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/noam-lanir-plans-to-float-empire-online-at-1b-value-1.159508|title=Noam Lanir plans to float Empire Online at $1b value|publisher=Haaretz|date=May 25, 2005|accessdate=October 15, 2010|first=Galya |last=Yemini|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114142401/http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/noam-lanir-plans-to-float-empire-online-at-1b-value-1.159508|archivedate=14 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 1974, the Syrians returned Lanir's body.&lt;ref name="Sarna p. 148" /&gt; Former Israel Air Force Commander [[Mordechai Hod]] noted that Lanir had information that would have placed the existence of Israel at risk had he revealed it to the Syrians.

'''''Avtomanija''''' is the leading [[Slovene language|Slovene]] automobile [[internet portal]] and magazine (2005-2010). The content is divided between [[automotive]] news, vehicle reviews, and [[motorsports]] coverage. Originally only a motoring website since 1998, expanded to magazine publishing in 2005. In the 2006, under the direction of longtime editor [[Artur Švarc]], changed its name from ''Avtomania'' to ''Avtomanija'', 32 page magazine published weekly. Name was changed due incorrect spelling of the word, which was in original partially English and partially Slovenian. ''Avtomanija'' was up to date Slovenia's only weekly automotive magazine.

[[File:Barometer Goethe 04.jpg|thumb|right|A ''storm glass'' or ''Goethe's device'', an early practical type of barometer. Calandra's essay does not name the ''type'' of the device, although the answers provided by the student suggest the use of a portable [[Barometer#Aneroid barometers|aneroid barometer]].]]

The '''barometer question''' is an example of an incorrectly designed examination question demonstrating [[functional fixedness]] that causes a moral [[dilemma]] for the examiner. In its classic form, popularized by American [[Test (assessment)#Test preparations|test designer]] professor [[Alexander Calandra]] (1911–2006), the question asked the student to "show how it is possible to determine the height of a tall building with the aid of a [[barometer]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1968dec21-00060?View=PDF&lt;/ref&gt; The examiner was confident that there was one, and only one, correct answer, which is by calculating the difference in pressure at the top and bottom of the building. Contrary to the examiner's expectations, the student responded with a series of completely different answers. These answers were also correct, yet none of them proved the student's competence in the specific academic field being tested.

The barometer question achieved the status of an [[urban legend]]; according to an [[internet meme]], the question was asked at the [[University of Copenhagen]] and the student was [[Niels Bohr]].&lt;ref&gt;http://naturelovesmath-en.blogspot.in/2011/06/niels-bohr-barometer-question-myth.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kaplan, Inc.]] [[ACT (test)|ACT]] preparation textbook describes it as an "[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] legend",&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; and an early form is found in a 1958 American humor book.&lt;ref&gt;''Reader's Digest Treasury of Wit &amp;amp; Humor,'' [https://books.google.com/books?ei=CSY9UuTHH8rwkQXboYCgDg&amp;id=P7cNAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=aneroid+barometer p. 303]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Calandra presented the incident as a real-life, [[First-person narrative|first-person]] experience that occurred during the [[Sputnik crisis]].&lt;ref name=C229&gt;Calandra, Alexander, "Angels on a Pin".

== Calandra's account ==
A colleague of Calandra posed the barometer question to a student, expecting the correct answer: "the height of the building can be estimated in proportion to the difference between the barometer readings at the bottom and at the top of the building".&lt;ref&gt;A classic in-depth discussion of the subject was presented in 1823 by [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Rev. Baden Powell]] in ''Measurement of Heights by the Barometer'', published in [https://books.google.com/books?id=gTkwAAAAYAAJ volume 22, numbers I through V], of the ''[[Annals of Philosophy]]''. For a modern presentation of the same subject, see Silverman, pp. 40-48. The particular formula sought by Calandra's examiner is marked with index 2.12 on page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The student provided a different, and also correct answer: "Take the barometer to the top of the building. Attach a long rope to it, lower the barometer to the street, then bring it up, measuring the length of the rope. The length of the rope is the height of the building."&lt;ref name=C228&gt;Calandra, Alexander, "Angels on a Pin". Reproduced in Barnes et al., pp. 228-229. p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The examiner and Calandra, who was called to advise on the case, faced a moral [[dilemma]]. According to the format of the exam, a correct answer deserved a full credit. But issuing a full credit would have violated [[academic standards]] by rewarding a student who had not demonstrated competence in the academic field that had been tested ([[physics]]). Neither of two available options (pass or fail) was morally acceptable.&lt;ref name=C228/&gt;

Calandra asked the student the same question, and received a wealth of different answers including dropping the barometer from the top of the building and timing its fall with a stopwatch; trading the barometer to the building's superintendent in return for the information wanted; creating two small [[pendulum]]s and measuring the variation of g from the ground to the top of the building; creating a pendulum as high as the building and measuring its period; and comparing the length of the shadows of the building and the barometer. The student admitted that he knew the expected "correct" answer, but was fed up with the professor's "teaching him how to think ... rather than teaching him the structure of the subject."&lt;ref name=C229/&gt;

== Internet meme ==
According to [[Snopes.com]], more recent (1999 and 1988) versions identify the problem as a question in "a physics degree exam at the [[University of Copenhagen]]" and the student as [[Niels Bohr]], and includes the following answers:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/college/exam/barometer.asp snopes.com: The Barometer Problem]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Tying a piece of string to the barometer, lowering the barometer from the roof to the ground, and measuring the length of the string and barometer.
* Dropping the barometer off the roof, measuring the time it takes to hit the ground, and calculating the building's height assuming [[Equations of motion#Constant linear acceleration|constant acceleration under gravity]].
* When the sun is shining, standing the barometer up, measuring the height of the barometer and the lengths of the shadows of both barometer and building, and finding the building's height using [[similar triangles]].
* Tying a piece of string to the barometer, and swinging it like a pendulum both on the ground and on the roof, and from the known pendulum length and swing period, calculate the [[gravitational field]] for the two cases.  Use [[Newton's law of gravitation]] to calculate the radial altitude of both the ground and the roof.  The difference will be the height of the building.
* Tying a piece of string to the barometer, which is as long as the height of the building, and swinging it like a pendulum, and from the swing period, calculate the pendulum length.
* Marking off the number of barometer lengths vertically along the emergency staircase, and multiplying this with the length of the barometer.
* Trading the barometer for the correct information with the building's janitor or superintendent.
* Measuring the pressure difference between ground and roof and calculating the height difference (the expected answer).

== Interpretations ==
Professor of physics Mark Silverman used what he called "The Barometer-Story formula" precisely for explaining the subject of [[pressure]] and recommended it to physics teachers. Silverman called Calandra's story "a delightful essay that I habitually read to my class whenever we study fluids ... the essay is short, hilarious and satisfying (at least to me and my class)."&lt;ref name=S40&gt;Silverman, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial advisor [[Robert G. Allen (author)|Robert G. Allen]] presented Calandra's essay to illustrate the process and role of [[creativity]] in finance. "Creativity is born when you have a problem to solve. And as you can see from this story ["Angels on a Pin"] there are many ways of solving a problem. Creativity is the art of looking for solutions that are out of the ordinary, different, unorthodox."&lt;ref&gt;Allen, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Meara used the barometer question to illustrate the art of steering students' activities to a desired outcome: "if the question is not aligned [with the desired learning outcome] then the problem becomes an exercise of problem solving for its own value."&lt;ref name=M108&gt;O'Meara, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher can steer the students either through careful design of the questions (this rules out ''barometer questions''), or through guiding the students to the desired choices. In case of the original barometer question, the examiner may explicitly say that the problem has more than one solution, insist on applying the laws of physics, or give them the "ending point" of the solution: "How did I discover that the building was 410 feet in height with only a barometer?"&lt;ref name=M108/&gt;

Herson used the Calandra account as an illustration of the difference between academic tests and assessment in education. Tests, even the ones designed for reliability and validity, are useful, but they are not sufficient in real-world education.&lt;ref&gt;Herson, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanders interpreted Calandra's story as a conflict between perfection and optimal solutions: "We struggle to determine a 'best' answer, when a simple call to a building superintendent (the resource man) would quickly provide adequate information."&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Concrete'''''|コンクリート|''Konkurīto''}} is a 2004 independently produced [[Japan]]ese film that recounts the story of the [[murder of Junko Furuta]]. The film deals as much with the [[society|social]] factors that produced Furuta's four assailants as it does with Furuta's suffering at their hands.

The film involves four boys who kidnap a girl named Misaki. The boys [[rape]], [[torture]], and murder her in a similar manner to the manner of the boys who killed Junko Furuta.

Many people protested the film's release before it even premiered, and it was eventually relegated to specialty theater showings and a [[DVD]] release.

The '''Dano-Hanseatic War''' from 1426–1435 (as was the ''[[Kalmar War]] with the Hanseatic League'') was an armed trade conflict between the Danish dominated [[Kalmar Union]] ([[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]]) and the German [[Hanseatic League]] (Hansa) led by the [[Free City of Lübeck]].

When Danish [[Eric of Pomerania|king Eric]] opened the Baltic trade routes for Dutch ships and introduced a new toll for all foreign ships passing the [[Øresund]] ([[Sound Dues]]), six Hanseatic cities ([[Hamburg]], [[Lübeck]], [[Lüneburg]], [[Rostock]], [[Stralsund]], [[Wismar]]) declared war, put a naval blockade on Scandinavian harbours and allied with Eric's enemy [[Henry IV, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg|Henry IV, count of Holstein]]. Therefore the war was intensively linked with the [[Dutch–Hanseatic War]] (1422/38–1441), the Kalmar War with Holstein (1409/22–1435) and the [[Engelbrekt rebellion|Swedish revolt]] (1434–1436).

After years of changing fortune in warfare Rostock and Stralsund signed a separate peace agreement in 1430. Lübeck, Hamburg, Wismar and Lüneburg, however, continued the war and assisted Holstein to conquer [[Flensburg]] in 1431. Thereafter they agreed an armistice in 1432 and started peace negotiations. Meanwhile an anti-Danish revolt broke out in Sweden (Engelbrekt rebellion). In 1434 Eric had to agree an armistice with the Swedes, too. In April 1435 he signed the peace of Vordingborg with the Hanseatic League and Holstein, followed by the [[Treaty of Stockholm (1435)|peace of Stockholm]] with Sweden a few months later the same year. The Hanseatic cities were excepted from the Sound Dues but they had to accept Dutch competition in the Baltic trade. The Danish [[Duchy of Schleswig]] was ceded to the count of Holstein. Sweden's autonomous rights and privileges were extended. These peace agreements weakened Eric's position dramatically, and in 1439 he got dethroned by Danish, Swedish and Norwegian Privy Councils.

The [[Chernobyl disaster]] ({{lang-uk|Чорнобильська катастрофа}}, ''Chornobylʹsʹka katastrofa'', ''Chernobyl accident'') was considered as one of the worst [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|nuclear disasters]] in history. It occurred on 26 April 1986 at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], then part of the [[Soviet Union]], now in [[Ukraine]]. The scientific consensus on the effects of the disaster has been developed by the [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR). In peer-reviewed publications UNSCEAR has identified 49 immediate deaths from trauma, [[acute radiation syndrome|acute radiation poisoning]], a helicopter crash, and from an original group of about 6,000 cases of [[thyroid cancer]]s in the affected area.&lt;ref name="UNSCEAR2008"&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2008/11-80076_Report_2008_Annex_D.pdf| title=Health effects due to radiation from the Chernobyl accident (Annex D of the 2008 UNSCEAR Report)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Total deaths ==
During mid-1986 the official Soviet death toll rose from 2 to 31. Following the disaster itself, the USSR organized an effort to stabilize and shore up the reactor area, still awash in radiation, using the efforts of more than 600,000 “[[Liquidator (Chernobyl)|liquidator]]s” recruited from all over the USSR. Some organizations claim that deaths as a result of the immediate aftermath and the cleanup operation may number at least 6,000,&lt;ref name="BulletinChernobyl"&gt;{{cite report |last=Marples |first=David R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;pg=PA20s |title=Chernobyl: The Decade of Despair |series=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=May 1996 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that exceeds the number of workers believed, by the [[National Commission for Radiation Protection of Ukraine]], to have died from all causes (including, for example, old age and traffic accidents). The UNSCEAR report cites only evidence for [[thyroid cancer]]s among children and teens (adults are more resistant to radiogenic thyroid disease caused by [[iodine-131]] poisoning) and some small amount of [[leukemia]] and eye [[cataract]]s among the most irradiated of the workers; no evidence for hard cancers has been found, despite waiting beyond the elapse of the usual ten year latency period.&lt;ref name="UNSCEAR2008" /&gt; For further information on the indirect health implications, see [[Chernobyl disaster#Assessing the disaster's effects on human health|Chernobyl disaster's effects on human health]].

Of great concern is the possible number of delayed deaths caused by hard cancer, leukemia and other diseases with longer time latencies following the release of radioactive debris from the disaster.  A United Nations' [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) study estimates the final total of premature deaths associated with the disaster will be around 4000,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1312_web.pdf Looking Back to go Forward: IAEA report 2008, p4]&lt;/ref&gt; mostly from an estimated 3% increase in cancers, which are already common causes of death in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chernobyl: the true scale of the accident| url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2005/pr38/en/ |website=WHO |publisher=WHO/IAEA/UNDP |accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some non-governmental organizations, many with staunch positions on the spectrum of the [[nuclear power debate]], have claimed numbers up to a million excess deaths caused by the nuclear disaster. UN and other international agencies such as the [[Chernobyl Forum]] and the [[World Health Organization]] state that such numbers are wildly over-estimated. The Chernobyl Forum also acknowledges an increase in psychological problems amongst those exposed to radiation, which may be attributed in part to poor communication of radiation effects and disruption to their way of life, but is also likely affected by other events surrounding the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Booklets/Chernobyl/chernobyl.pdf |title=Chernobyl’s Legacy: Health, Environmental and Socio-Economic Impacts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215212227/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Booklets/Chernobyl/chernobyl.pdf |archivedate=2010-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Safety-and-Security/Safety-of-Plants/Appendices/Chernobyl-Accident---Appendix-2--Health-Impacts/ |accessdate=22 June 2014 |title=Health Impacts, Chernobyl Accident, Appendix 2 |year=2009 |publisher=World Nuclear Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complicating the conflict is the fact that, with the exception of diagnoses of [[Acute Radiation Syndrome]], obvious industrial accidents on site, and a detailed analysis of thyroid cancers among children, assignment of causes of death is a statistical rather than a deterministic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/index |accessdate=22 June 2014 |title=What causes cancer? |publisher=American Cancer Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although non-peer-reviewed publications allege a variety of cancers, heart and other organ diseases, birth defects in children and grandchildren of nearby residents and other ailments, for the majority of these conditions radiation exposure is not even a recognized cause and, in any case, the incidence of such conditions in the relevant population has actually fallen since the Chernobyl incident. On the other hand, the effects of radiation are becoming better known as experience gathers and formerly disconnected illness may actually be the result of long-term, unseen damage during the exposure event.&lt;ref name="hempelman"&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Hempelman |first1=Louis Henry |last2=Lushbaugh |first2=Clarence C. |author2link=Clarence C.

The total number of deaths, including future deaths, is highly controversial, and estimates range from "up to" 4,000 (by a team of over 100 scientists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2005/pr38/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Chernobyl: the true scale of the accident|website=www.who.int|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) to the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] estimate is approximately 27,000 based on the LNT model,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://allthingsnuclear.org/post/4704112149/how-many-cancers-did-chernobyl-really-cause-updated| title=How Many Cancers Did Chernobyl Really Cause?| publisher=UCSUSA.org| date=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 93,000—200,000 (by Greenpeace&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{citation| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4917526.stm| title=Greenpeace rejects Chernobyl toll| date=18 April 2006| accessdate=8 May 2018| publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The expressed views of the authors, or by advocacy groups or individuals with specific opinions about the Annals Chernobyl volume, are their own. Although the New York Academy of Sciences believes it has a responsibility to provide open forums for discussion of scientific questions, the Academy has no intent to influence legislation by providing such forums. The Academy is committed to publishing content deemed scientifically valid by the general scientific community, from whom the Academy carefully monitors feedback.&lt;/ref&gt; is a 2007 Russian publication that concludes that there were 985,000 premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{citation| title=Details| url=http://www.nyas.org/publications/annals/Detail.aspx?cid=f3f3bd16-51ba-4d7b-a086-753f44b3bfc1| work=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences| publisher=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences| accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy arises because most of the deaths cannot be measured: any cancer deaths that may be caused by the accident are small compared to background rates of cancer. Theoretical estimates must rely instead on controversial models such as [[Linear no-threshold model|LNT]] or [[hormesis]] models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ourworldindata.org/what-was-the-death-toll-from-chernobyl-and-fukushima|title=What was the death toll from Chernobyl and Fukushima? - Our World in Data|website=Our World in Data|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deaths due to trauma and radiation sickness==
In the list following are 37 people whose deaths are officially directly attributable to the Chernobyl disaster. Of these, two died at the scene, four died in a single helicopter accident, 29 died within a few months of [[Acute Radiation Syndrome]] (ARS) and three died later from medical complications possibly caused by the accident. Of these people, one was a cinematographer, one a physician, five military personnel (four in a single helicopter), seven firefighters, two security guards and the rest staff at the power plant or subcontractors. At least one unidentified person is reported to have died of a coronary thrombosis at the scene, and nine children died of thyroid cancer (in 2005 that number was raised to 15&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chernobyl Accident 1986 |date=April 2014 |publisher=World Nuclear Association |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident/ |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but identifications are not known. No members of the general public other than the doctor were hospitalized in the month following the accident,&lt;ref name="chrono" /&gt; though a pair of fishermen, Pustavoit and Protasov, reportedly received 400&amp;nbsp;REM doses.&lt;ref name="Medvedev"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Truth about Chernobyl |first=Grigori |last=Medvedev |year=1991 |publisher=I.B.Tauris, |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VtmW082nSaIC&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;pg=PA86 |page=86 |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were a total of 137 confirmed cases of ARS, including [[Individual involvement in the Chernobyl disaster|Pyotr Palamarchuk]] who survived after a reported exposure to 800 roentgens, twice the normal 50% probability of death dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2008/04/24/chernobyl-victims-struggle-with-consequences-of-radiation-exposure |title=Chernobyl Victims Struggle With Consequences of Radiation Exposure |date=April 24, 2008 |last=Gee |first=Alistair |periodical=US News and World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 1971''' was the sixteenth edition of the annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It was held in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] on 3 April 1971.

Monaco's win was their first and only victory. The song was performed by a French singer, living in France, sung in French, conducted by a French native and written by a French team. [[Séverine (singer)|Séverine]] later claimed she never visited Monaco before or after her victory – a claim easily disproved by the preview video submitted by [[TMC (TV channel)|Télé-Monte-Carlo]] featuring the singer on location in the Principality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIBU2M8XkFg |title=Eurovision 1971 PREVIEW Monaco – SÉVERINE "Un Banc, Un Arbre, Une Rue" |publisher=YouTube |date=8 August 2009 |accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contest was held at the [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin|Gaiety Theatre]] in [[Dublin]], the capital and most populous city of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geography.ie/geography/social/docs/dublin.pdf |title=The Growth and Development of Dublin |format=PDF |accessdate=30 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330062241/http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/technology/mexican-city-to-be-twinned-with-dublin-says-lord-mayor-1.1343005 |archivedate=30 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/primate+city |title=Primate City Definition and Examples |accessdate=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time that the contest was held in Ireland.

== Format ==
For the first time, each participating broadcaster was required to televise all the songs in "[[Eurovision Song Contest Previews|previews]]" prior to the live final. Belgium's preview video featured Nicole &amp; Hugo performing the song "[[Goeiemorgen, morgen]]", but Nicole was struck with a sudden illness days before the contest final, with [[Jacques Raymond]] &amp; [[Lily Castel]] stepping in at short notice to perform the entry in their place. Reports suggested that Castel had not even had enough time to buy a suitable dress for the show.

The [[BBC]] were worried about the possible audience reaction to the UK song due to [[The Troubles|the hostilities]] raging in [[Northern Ireland]]. They specifically selected a singer from Northern Ireland, [[Clodagh Rodgers]], who was popular in both the UK and the Republic of Ireland, to ease any ill-feeling from the Dublin audience. However, Rodgers still received death threats from the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] for representing the UK.

Groups of up to six people were allowed to perform for the first time, with the rule in previous contests of performing either solo or as a duet abolished.&lt;ref name="EBU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=287 |title=Eurovision Song Contest 1971 |publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was only [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]'s second outside broadcast in colour. The contest was broadcast in [[Iceland]], the [[United States|USA]] and [[Hong Kong]] several days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkRdok4EJVQ#t=163s/ |title=Eurovision 1971 – Opening ceremony |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voting system ===
A new voting system was introduced in this year's contest: each country sent two jury members, one aged over 25 and the other under 25 (with at least ten years' difference between their ages), with both awarding each country (except their own) a score of between one and five points.

While this meant that no country could score fewer than 34 points (and in the event all eighteen scored at least 52), it had one major problem: some jury members tended to award only one or two points. Whether this was done to increase their respective countries' chances of winning is not known for sure, but this shortcoming was nonetheless plain.&lt;ref name="EBU" /&gt; However, the system remained in place for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] contests.

== Participating countries ==

This brought the total number of countries to eighteen.

=== Conductors ===
Each performance had a [[conducting|conductor]] who directed the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andtheconductoris.eu |title=And the conductor is... |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3578">The '''False Waldemar''', also known as the Wrong Woldemar († 1356 in [[Dessau]]) was an [[impostor]] who from 1348 to 1350 was invested with the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Mark Brandenburg]] by Charles IV.

== Life ==

The legitimate [[Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal]] was buried in 1319. After this supposed extinction of the Brandenburg [[House of Ascania]], the [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]] [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Louis the Bavarian]] awarded the Mark of Brandenburg to his own son [[Louis V, Duke of Bavaria|Louis]] in 1320. Twenty-eight years later, in the summer of 1348 (or, according to Carlyle, twenty-five years in 1345&lt;ref name=C160&gt;Carlyle, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;) an elderly man claiming to be a returning pilgrim presenting himself to the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Archbishop of Magdeburg]] [[Otto of Hesse|Otto]] as ''the'' old Brandenburg Margrave Woldemar. He claimed the burial of 1319 had been staged, and that he had in the meantime been on a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]]. This False Waldemar was allegedly Jacob Roebuck or Rehbuck,&lt;ref name=C160/&gt; possibly a journeyman miller. [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote that he might have been in real Waldemar's employ where he could have learned his master's manners.&lt;ref name=C160/&gt; This and other rumors are not more than speculation by contemporaries and chroniclers. His true identity is still unknown. 

False Woldemar quickly gained adherents, especially among the rivals of the Wittelsbach royals. He posed as a representative of the ancestral Ascanian Princely House, which he promised to help against the foreign and unpopular Bavaria. Within weeks the False Waldemar was able to convince a large portion of the Mark. Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], on the defensive, invested the Wrong Woldemar on 2 October 1348 with the Mark Brandenburg. Only a few towns held on to the Wittelsbach. It was from this period that the town of [[Treuenbrietzen]] gained its prefix meaning faithful.

Two years later, in April 1350, the False Woldemar was exposed as a cheat. Charles deposed him as because of an agreement with the Wittelsbach (Treaty of Eltville). From this time on,  Woldemar held an Ascanian court at [[Anhalt-Dessau]], where he retained courtly honor all his life, before he died in 1356 of natural causes.

== In literature ==

[[Thomas Carlyle]] in his ''[[History of Friedrich II of Prussia]]'' called False Waldemar "the wickedest and worst trouble of their [Ascanian] raising",&lt;ref name=C160/&gt; "a new [[goblin]], where already there were plenty, in the dance round poor Ludwig [Louis the Bavarian]".&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Willibald Alexis]] wrote his novel ''Der falsche Woldemar'' (''The False Woldemar'') in 1842. A more recent novel is ''Der letzte Askanier'' (''The Last of Ascanians'') by [[Horst Bosetzky]] (1999), which explores the events around the Wrong Woldemar, with the author adding his own theory as to the identity of the alleged Ascanian.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6494">According to Roman tradition, the '''''Foedus Cassianum''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|d|ə|s|_|ˌ|k|æ|ʃ|i|ˈ|eɪ|n|ə|m}} in English) or the '''Treaty of Cassius''' was a [[treaty]] which formed an [[military alliance|alliance]] between the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Latin League]] in 493 BC after the [[Battle of Lake Regillus]]. It ended the war between the Latin League and Rome, placing Rome as equal in power to all of the members of the League combined.

==Background==

[[File:Lake regillus.jpg|thumb|right|400 px|An engraving of Lake Regillus.]]

In their [[Treaties between Rome and Carthage#First treaty|first treaty with Carthage]], the Romans listed the surrounding countryside as part of its territory, which the Latin League contested, claiming that the said territory actually belonged to them. A war followed, with the result of a victory for the Romans at the Battle of Lake Regillus and conditional surrender soon after.

The treaty was concluded in 493 between Rome and thirty Latin cities as two independent powers.  The [[Foederati|foedus]] took its name from [[Spurius Cassius Viscellinus]], who was a [[Roman consul|consul]] of the Roman Republic at the time the treaty was signed, and ratified the treaty in Rome on Rome's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
The treaty laid out several terms. Not only did it stipulate that there would be peace between the two parties, the treaty mandated that the [[Roman army|Roman]] and [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] armies would be joined to provide mutual defence from Italic tribes. Another term was that the Latin League and Rome would split all spoils taken in war. Also, the two parties agreed to set up joint colonies in captured territory so that they both might prosper.  Finally, it established a community of private rights between citizens of Rome and any Latin city. The treaty, of which a bronze copy survived in the Roman Forum until [[Cicero]]'s day, was a landmark in the early history of Rome.  The original does not survive.  A version given by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] is

:"Let there be peace among the Romans and all the Latin cities as long as the heavens and the earth shall remain where they are.  Let them neither make war upon one another themselves, nor bring in foreign enemies nor grant a safe passage to those who shall make war upon either.  Let them assist one another when warred upon, with all their forces, and let each have an equal share of the spoils and booty taken in their common wars.  Let suits relating to private contracts be determined within ten days, and in the nation where the contract was made. And let it not be permitted to add anything to, or take anything away from these treaties except by consent both of the Romans and of all the Latins"&lt;ref&gt;Christopher John Smith [https://books.google.com/books?id=aAUfWgRvoRoC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=foedus+cassianum+dionysius&amp;source=web&amp;ots=c4viUifq-S&amp;sig=328G_5lzgGPjPBjPqRbLOLE7pQw#PPA212,M1 Early Rome and Latium: Economy and Society C. 1000 to 500 BC],''Oxford University Press'', p.212&lt;/ref&gt;

Dionysius' version mentions a mutual defense pact between the Romans and Latins, but omits any mention of a joint command structure or any provision for mutual consultation. A few fragmentary sentences from L. Cincius (as quoted by Festus) indicated that the Latins would meet at the spring of [[Ferentina]] to discuss the issue of command.  In addition, he describes the process followed "in a year when it was the responsibility of the Romans to supply a commander for the army by order of the Latin name".&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;Tim J. Cornell  [https://books.google.com/books?id=kA7euuQkRgIC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299&amp;dq=foedus+cassianum+ferentina&amp;source=web&amp;ots=A_u6MHttgh&amp;sig=Biz0iGApLBjMAFCANWRhlp-VFV4#PPA299,M1 The Beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c. 1000-264 BC)],''Routledge'', 1995, p.299  {{ISBN|0-415-01596-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The passage is somewhat vague, and seems to imply that command of the army would alternate in years between the Latins and the Romans. However, this appears to have never occurred, and so the most probable explanation is that a Roman commander was summoned only in years when a campaign actually took place.&lt;ref name=Cornell/&gt;

==Expansion of treaty==
In 486 BC Rome (again through the efforts of Spurius Cassius Viscellinus) entered into a [[Roman conquest of the Hernici#The foedus Cassianum - 5th century BC|treaty]] with the [[Hernici]].  The terms were apparently similar to the foedus Cassianum, and there is a suggestion (though not certain) that the Hernici may have been admitted as a party to the actual foedus Cassianum between Rome and the Latin allies.

==Effects==
The treaty strengthened Rome greatly, as it essentially added the military power of the Latins to the army of the fledgling Roman Republic. This allowed Rome to expand further, conquering much of the [[Italian Peninsula]]. The treaty was renewed in 358 BC.  However, Rome reneged on the treaty soon after that, and the [[Latin War]] began. Rome eventually overcame the non-Roman members of the league, and the ''Foedus Cassianum'' was rendered void.

The '''Game Developers Conference''' ('''GDC''') is a yearly [[conference]] for [[video game developer]]s.

The event has learning, inspiration, and networking. The event includes an expo, networking events, and awards shows like the [[Game Developers Choice Awards]] and [[Independent Games Festival]], and a variety of [[tutorial]]s, lectures, and [[round table|roundtables]] by industry professionals on game-related topics covering [[game programmer|programming]], [[game design|design]], audio, production, business and management, and visual arts.

==History==
[[File:Outside of Game Developers Conference 2004.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Outside the San Jose Convention Center during GDC 2004.]]
Originally called the Computer Game Developers Conference, the first conference was organized in April 1988 by [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]] in his [[San Jose, California]]-area living room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmatazz.com/personal/experiences/the-computer-game-developer.html|title=The Computer Game Developers' Conference - Interactive Storytelling Tools for Writers - Chris Crawford|work=Erasmatazz|date=2010-08-14|accessdate=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; About twenty-seven designers attended, including [[Don Daglow]], [[Brenda Laurel]], [[Brian Moriarty]], [[Gordon Walton]], Tim Brengle, [[Cliff Johnson (game designer)|Cliff Johnson]], Dave Menconi, and Carol and Ivan Manley. The second conference, held that same year at a [[Holiday Inn]] at [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]], attracted about 125 developers. Early conference directors included [[Brenda Laurel]], Tim Brengle, Sara Reeder, Dave Menconi, Jeff Johannigman, Stephen Friedman, [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]], and Stephanie Barrett. Later directors include John Powers, [[Nicky Robinson (game programmer)|Nicky Robinson]], [[Anne Westfall]], Susan Lee-Merrow, and [[Ernest W. Adams]]. In the early years the conference changed venue each year to accommodate its increases in size. Attendance in this period grew from 525 to 2387.  By 1994 the CGDC could afford to sponsor the creation of the [[Computer Game Developers Association]] with Adams as its founding director. In 2005, the GDC moved to the new [[Moscone Center|Moscone Center West]], in the heart of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco's]] [[South of Market (San Francisco)|SOMA]] district, and reported over 12,000 attendees.  The GDC returned to San Jose in 2006, reporting over 12,500 attendees, and moved to San Francisco in 2007 – where the organizers expect it will stay for the foreseeable future. Attendance figures continued to rise in following years with 18,000 attendees in 2008 event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/news/gdc-2008-breaks-attendance-record-with-over-18k "GDC 2008 Breaks Attendance Record with 18K"]. [[GameDaily]]. February 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2009 Game Developers Conference was held in San Francisco, on March 23–27, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kidzworld.com/article/17061-game-developers-conference-summary "Game Developers Conference Summary"]. Kidzworld.com. Retrieved on 2009-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IGDA]] awarded 25 scholarships to send qualified students to attend the 2009 GDC.

Crawford continued to give the conference keynote address for the first several years of the conference, including the famous "whip" speech in the early 1990s where he punctuated a point about game tuning and player involvement by cracking a [[bullwhip]] perilously close to the front row of the audience.

Crawford also founded The Journal of Computer Game Design in 1987 in parallel to beginning the GDC, and served as publisher and editor of the academic-style journal through 1996.

The CGDC changed its name to "Game Developers Conference" in 1999. The GDC has also hosted the [[Spotlight Awards (GDC)|Spotlight Awards]] from 1997 to 1999, the [[Independent Games Festival]] since 1999 and the [[Game Developers Choice Awards]] since 2001. The GDC is also used for the annual meeting of the [[International Game Developers Association]] (IGDA).

The [[Independent Games Festival]] (IGF) is the first and largest competition for independent games, and highlights the innovative achievements of developers ranging in size from individuals building PC titles to studio teams creating console downloadable titles.  A pool of judges from the game industry selects the finalists and winners, and the individual creators are named as the recipients of the awards.  The IGF is managed and developed by [[UBM TechWeb]], the organizer of the GDC.

[[File:Game Developers Conference 2005 entrance.jpeg|thumb|240px|2005 Game Developers Conference entrance]]
The [[Game Developers Choice Awards]] is the game industry's only open, peer-based awards show.  Any member of the IGDA may nominate games, and then the membership votes on the finalists.  As with the IGF, the individual creators are named as the recipients of the awards.  Specialty awards such as Lifetime Achievement and First Penguin are determined by the GDCA committee, and all are revealed at the Game Developers Choice Awards ceremony at the GDC.  The IGF and the GDCA are presented back to back, in an awards show produced by UBM TechWeb, typically on the Wednesday of the GDC.

UBM TechWeb has added several other events to the GDC in recent years. At the GDC Expo, developers display the latest techniques useful in game development. "GDC Mobile," first held in 2002, focuses on developing games for [[mobile phone]]s.  Starting in 2004, the GDC partnered with Game Connection to present Game Connection @ GDC, a live matchmaking service for developers and publishers, which in 2007 expanded to include Game Connection Services for outsourcing and other services.  Starting in 2006, the GDC partnered with [[Video Games Live]] to feature their symphonic performance of videogame music as the closing night event. In addition, the GDC has hosted a number of conference-wide game experiments designed by GameLab. The 2017 GDC included a Board Game Design Day, featuring talks from developers and publishers of [[tabletop game]]s on their design processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2017/3/14/14921754/gdc-vault-pandemic-legacy-mechs-vs-minions-daviau-lang-cantrell-dean | title = Watch all of the board game talks from GDC free online | first = Charlie | last = Hall | date = March 14, 2017 | accessdate = March 14, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UBM TechWeb has also produced several spinoff events.  For example, the first GDC Europe (GDCE) was featured at the [[European Computer Trade Show]] (ECTS) in [[London]] between August 31 and September 1, 2001. Other GDC-related events include the Serious Games Summit, first held in 2004 as a GDC tutorial, and spun off as a standalone event in 2005, focusing on developing [[serious game|games]] for practical purposes, such as education, corporate training, military, and health care applications; and the Hollywood and Games Summit in conjunction with [[The Hollywood Reporter]] first held in June 2006.  Additional events include the Game Advertising Summit, the Game Outsourcing Summit, the Game Career Seminar, GDC Russia, the China Game Summit, GDC London, the London Games Summit, the London Game Career Fair, and many others.  In late 2006, UBM TechWeb acquired The Game Initiative, and now produces the Austin Game Developers Conference.

===GDC China===
Recognizing the burgeoning games market in China, UBM TechWeb brought its flagship event to Shanghai in 2007. With the continued support of Ministry of Culture of the People’s Republic of China, GDC China is held in Shanghai annually and approached its fifth year in November 2012. GDC China has since been cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdcchina.cn|title=游戏开发者大会 • 中国|website=www.gdcchina.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IGF China===
GDC China hosted the annual Independent Games Festival China (IGF China) from 2009, calling for entries developed by the independent game studios and individuals in the Asia-Pacific region. IGF China includes the Independent Games Summit, the Independent Games Festival Pavilion, and the Independent Games Festival Awards Ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gdcchina.cn/events/igf IGF China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118231250/http://www.gdcchina.cn/events/igf |date=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recurring highlights==

===Tutorials===
About half of the time during the first two days of GDC are given over to tutorials, one- or two-day-long sessions on a given topic. Tutorials take the form of hands-on workshops and cover a variety of technical subjects such as game design, audio, topics in computer programming (such as physics, graphics programing or web technologies), production and business management.

===Summits===
A summit is a section of panels dedicated to a sub-segment of the game industry, also usually held on the first two days of the conference. Past and current summit topics include mobile games, independent games, game education (of students aspiring to join the industry), [[serious games]], [[Social-network game|social games]], [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]], and online games.

===Console Maker's Keynotes===
Regularly, [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], [[Microsoft]] and [[Nintendo]] deliver keynotes at the conference showcasing upcoming products and technologies. Next to the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], GDC keynotes are one of the more significant sources of news about upcoming console hardware and platforms, but with a focus on the developer audience instead of the wider press. A number of games in development or upcoming releases are also showcased, but generally far fewer than at E3.

===Developer's Rant===
Since 2005, the "rant" panel has been one of the most popular sessions at the conference. Moderated by [[Eric Zimmerman]] and [[Jason Della Rocca]], a selection of notable industry figures are invited to speak on industry-related subjects they are passionate about.  According to Zimmerman, the idea of the panel "is to really take those grumblings and mutterings and bring them out into the light, speak truth to power, cut through to the real s***, and talk about what is going on in our industry—what's wrong and what we can do to change it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6120449.html |title=GDC rant heard 'round the world |date=March 18, 2005 |first=Galen |last=Davis |publisher=Gamespot.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606215623/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6120449.html |archivedate=2007-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many rants inspire controversy, discussion and a good deal of media coverage in industry press. Most rant sessions focus on a particular segment of the industry to draw their speakers from:

* 2005: "Burning Down The House: Game Developers Rant"
* 2006: "Burn Baby, Burn: Game Developers Rant"
* 2007: "Burning Mad: Game Publishers Rant"
* 2008: "Pouring Gas on the Flames: Game Designers Rant"
* 2009: "Burned by Friendly Fire: Game Critics Rant"
* 2010: "Fired and Fired-Up: Jobless Developers Rant"
* 2011: "No Freaking Respect! Social Game Developers Rant Back"
* 2012: "Burn this MotherFather!: Game Dev Parents Rant"
* 2013: "Mad as Hell: Hothead Developers Rant Back"
* 2014: "Rant Apocalypse: The 10th Anniversary Mega Session"

The Rant panel has inspired similarly structured sessions, with more specialized topics (e.g., "Game Educators Rant" during the Education Summit, or rants during the Indie Game Summit).

===Game Design Challenge===
[[Eric Zimmerman]] created the Game Design Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = GDC: The Game Design Challenge: The Nobel Peace Prize | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2633/gdc_the_game_design_challenge_.php| date = March 24, 2006 | accessdate = 2007-07-25 | first = Vincent |last=Diamante }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The idea of the challenge, he said, was to give everyone a sense of the process behind game design, and to attempt to get everyone thinking about new kinds of games." No actual game needs to be built, just designed. The goal of the 2nd annual Game Design Challenge was to create a game based on [[Emily Dickinson]]. It was won by [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]] who designed an Emily Dickinson personality simulator contained entirely on a [[USB flash drive]]. The personality would interact with the player by sending [[Instant messaging|Instant Messages]] and [[email]]. The goal was to maintain a stable relationship and avoid the two extremes: romantic obsession with the player or suicidal depression. The first occurrence meant constant interruptions when using the computer. The latter occurrence allowed for the simulation to delete itself. The 3rd time, the task was to create a game worthy of a [[Nobel Prize]]. [[Harvey Smith (game designer)|Harvey Smith]] won with his PeaceBomb game. It would utilize wireless devices to organize [[flash mobs]] to engage in random acts of charity. For the first 3 challenges, Eric Zimmerman has always ended the challenge by indicating that all the contestants ideas could really be made into a game.

The goal of the 4th annual Game Design Challenge was to create a game which was a [[religion]], or which could become one. It was won by [[Jason Rohrer]] who designed a one-player at a time multiplayer game named ''[[Chain World]]'' contained entirely on a [[USB flash drive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = GDC: The Game Design Challenge: Bigger Than Jesus | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/36021/GDC_Vault_Debuts_2011s_Game_Design_Challenge_Session_Video.php | date = July 22, 2011 | accessdate = 2011-07-25 | author = Gamasutra Staff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experimental Gameplay Workshop ===
The Experimental Gameplay Workshop is a two-hour workshop that showcases experimental video games and game prototypes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/229709/GDCs_Experimental_Gameplay_Workshop_needs_your_crazy_prototypes.php|title=GDC's Experimental Gameplay Workshop needs your crazy prototypes|last=Staff|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of experimental titles that were featured at EGW went on to become some of the most well-regarded in the industry, such as ''[[Katamari Damacy]]'' and ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Givat HaMivtar''' ({{Lang-he-n|גִּבְעַת הַמִּבְתָּר}}) is an Israeli settlement and a neighborhood in [[East Jerusalem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fmep.org/settlement_info/settlement-info-and-tables/stats-data/settlements-in-east-jerusalem/?searchterm=None |title=Settlements in East Jerusalem |publisher=Foundation for Middle East Peace}}&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1970 between [[Ramat Eshkol]] and [[French Hill]]. It is located on a hill where an important battle took place in the [[Six Day War]]. Archaeological excavations have revealed important ancient Jewish tombs in the region. Givat Hamivtar was one of the first "Build Your Own Home" neighborhoods in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="maavak"&gt;{{cite book

The international community considers Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem [[International law and Israeli settlements|illegal under international law]], but the Israeli government disputes this.&lt;ref name="BBC_GC4"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1682640.stm |title=The Geneva Convention |publisher=BBC News |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The hill on which Givat Hamivtar was established was the site of a [[Kingdom of Jordan|Jordanian]] [[fort]], one of a series of military installations blocking Jewish access to [[Mount Scopus]] and cutting off [[Hadassah Hospital]], the [[Hebrew University]], and the [[National Library of Israel]] from West Jerusalem.{{when|date=October 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_sys/picture/atarim/Toursite_form_atar.asp?site_id=8542&amp;pic_cat=1&amp;icon_cat=5&amp;york_cat=8&amp;type_id=318 |title=Ammunition Hill|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617063656/http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_sys/picture/atarim/Toursite_form_atar.asp?site_id=8542&amp;pic_cat=1&amp;icon_cat=5&amp;york_cat=8&amp;type_id=318|archivedate=17 June 2011|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jordanians called it ''Tal al-Mudura'', lit. "round hill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://noar.education.gov.il/main/upload/perut/nale1.doc |script-title=he:שער ראשון "אם אשכחך" |language=he |trans-title=The first gate, "If I forget thee" |publisher=Israel Ministry of Education |format=Microsoft Word doc |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordanian snipers used this strategic location to fire on Israeli troops during the [[Battle of Ammunition Hill]]. Givat HaMivtar was conquered by an Israeli [[tank]] force after two attempts. The first mission failed after an Israeli soldier was killed by [[friendly fire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Moshe Meir |date=30 April 2006 |script-title=he:אבי אבי |language=he |trans-title=Avi Avi |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/health/1.1102067 |newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Uri Milstein |url=http://www.faz.co.il/story?id=352&amp;force_skin=print0 |script-title=he:קרב גבעת התחמושת כמשל |language=he |trans-title=The battle of Ammunition Hill as a parable |date=6 June 2002 |publisher=Faz |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jerusalem neighborhood of Givat Hamivtar was planned as part of a sequence of Jewish neighborhoods called the ''bariah'' or "hinge" neighborhoods&lt;ref name="maavak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="siyur"&gt;[http://www.02net.co.il/site/templates/inPage.asp?catID=1&amp;subID=17&amp;docID=16698&amp;SearchWord=%F9%EB%E5%F0%E5%FA%20%E4%E1%F8%E9%E7 סיור לאורך "הקו העירוני", אילן שפירא] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting west Jerusalem to Mount Scopus. The name of the neighborhood means "bissected hill," either referring to the crisscross of Jordan bunkers that existed before the neighborhood was built,&lt;ref name="siyur"/&gt; or the earthworks cutting through Mount Scopus to create a road from [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Jerusalem's Old City]] to [[Nablus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eshkolbagiva.org.il/Index.asp?ArticleID=5&amp;CategoryID=46&amp;Page=1 |script-title=he:גבעת המבתר ורמות אשכול |language=he |trans-title=Givat Hamivtar and Ramot Eshkol |publisher=Congregational administration of the neighborhoods French Hill, Givat HaMivtar, Tzameret Habira and Ramot Eshkol |accessdate=29 August 2014 |title=Archived copy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903093749/http://www.eshkolbagiva.org.il/Index.asp?ArticleID=5&amp;CategoryID=46&amp;Page=1# |archive-date=2014-09-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2008.uploaded.fresh.co.il/2008/09/11/10469627.jpg |script-title=he:המיבתר במרומי הר הצופים |language=he |trans-title=HaMivtar atop Mount Scopus}} The earthworks cutting picture, early 1970s.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1967, [[Prime Minister]] [[Levi Eshkol]] ordered government clerks to bypass the ordinary procedures to allow for Givat HaMivtar and the other hinge neighborhoods to be built as quickly as possible. When purchasing land encountered difficulties, some tracts were expropriated.&lt;ref name="maavak"/&gt; To speed up the building process, land was [[subsidize]]d by the government.&lt;ref name="maavak"/&gt; Most of the homes in Givat HaMivtar were [[Self-build|privately built]]. The majority of the homes were two-family homes, originally one-story high, to which a second and often a third floor was added over time.

==Archaeology==
Numerous archeological digs have been carried out in Givat HaMivtar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/search.asp?q=%E4%EE%E1%FA%F8&amp;site_name=&amp;submit1=%E7%F4%F9&amp;Writer=&amp;permit= |script-title=he:כתב העת "חדשות ארכאולוגיות"] באתר רשות העתיקות |language=he |trans-title=Archaeological News}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;!-- this is a search page not an info page!--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sepulchers discovered in the course of the digs were determined to be Jewish tombs of the [[Second Temple of Jerusalem|Second Temple]] period.

===Tomb of crucified man===
One tomb yielded the only physical evidence for the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Tradition|custom]] of [[crucifixion]] found to date.&lt;ref name=chester&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718171841/http://chesterrep.openrepository.com/cdr/bitstream/10034/40813/1/Some%20Notes%20on%20Crucifixion.pdf Some Notes on Crucifixion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EdbdQ-5fMr0C |author=David W.

The tip of the nail was bent, perhaps because of striking a knot in the upright beam, which prevented it being extracted from the foot.

===Tomb of "Simon, builder of the temple"===
Another tomb, highly ornate, held the remains of the family of "Simon, builder of the temple" (Simon Bana Hekhalah), probably a builder of the [[Second Temple#Herod.27s Temple|Herodian Temple]], as his name indicates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biu.ac.il/js/le/Faculty/eyal/4.rtf הקבורה המשפחתית והחוץ-משפחתית בירושלים ובסביבתה בתקופת בית הורדוס]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="siyurim"&gt;דוד בנבנישתי '''סיורים בירושלים''' קירית ספר 1980{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsinisrael.gov.il/en/items/Pages/ItemCard.aspx?IdItem=ICMS_IMJ_227513  Image of the ossuary from the [[Israel Museum, Jerusalem, with extensive caption]]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/ossuary-bearing-an-aramaic-inscription-reading-simon-builder-of-the-temple/hQGSBSy2J5gGmQ?hl=en Image of the ossuary from the Israel Museum, Jerusalem]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomb of Abba===
A third archaeologically interesting  tomb on Givat HaMivtar is that of "Abba, son [descendant?] of the priest Eleazar, son [descendant] of [[Aaron]] the  high (priest)." The inscription is in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], but written in the by then anachronistic [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|ancient Hebrew script]]. In the tomb prepared for his family, Abba, who had been [[exile]]d to [[Babylon]], secretly brought back to Jerusalem and buried the remains of "Mattathiah son of Juda(h)".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721145546/http://www.teva.org.il/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/ktovot_bayit2.pdf כתובות מתקופת בית שני, המשנה והתלמוד] website of the [[Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.

In his view, no other set of remains found there could be associated with King Antigonus II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Jerusalem tomb, 'blind leading the blind' or just another Day in Paradise? |author=Joe Zias |work=The Bible and Interpretation |publisher=Mark Elliott and Patricia Landy |date=April 2014 |url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/2014/04/zia388008.shtml |accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tomb Inscription at Givat Hamivtar |work=COJS Jewish History Database |publisher=Center for Online Judaic Studies (COJS) |date=12 January 2009 |url=http://cojs.org/tomb_inscription_at_givat_hamivtar |accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Givat HaMivtar has only preschools and kindergartens. The elementary schools of Ramat Eshkol were built on the border between the two neighborhoods in order to serve them both. High schools are located on French Hill and Ma'allot Dafna.&lt;ref name="maavak"/&gt;

The first [[synagogue]] in Givat HaMivtar was unique in that prayer services followed a non-specific [[nusach]] so that Jews of all ethnic groups could pray there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Avishai Ben Haim |date=8 February 2005 |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/11/ART/867/083.html |script-title=he:אדיר זיק הובא למנוחות |language=he |trans-title=Adir Zik was laid to rest |newspaper=Maariv |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first decade of this millennium, many of the neighborhood's [[secular]] and [[Modern Orthodox]] residents have moved out, and [[Ultra Orthodox Judaism|ultra-Orthodox Jews]] have become a majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tamar Rotem |date=20 February 2008 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/beit-hakerem-the-last-secular-holdout-in-jerusalem-1.239732 |title=Beit Hakerem - The last secular holdout in Jerusalem |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |author=Ronit Mizrahi |author2=Mirav Shalom |date=28 April 2009 |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/54/ART1/884/085.html |script-title=he:בגובה העיניים עם שלמה רוזנר, |language=he |trans-title=At eye level with Shlomo Rosner |publisher=NRG |accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hardcore Homecoming''' was a series of [[professional wrestling]] events which were advertised as a reunion of talent from the defunct [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] promotion. The tour was [[List of professional wrestling terms#B|booked]] and [[Professional wrestling promotion|promoted]] by [[Cody Michaels]], [[Shane Douglas]] (a former [[ECW Championship|ECW World Heavyweight Champion]]) and [[Jeremy Borash]] in 2005. The event footage was released on DVD with a companion [[Documentary film|documentary]] of ECW's history called ''Forever Hardcore''.

==History==
The inaugural Hardcore Homecoming event was held from 8:00pm to 11:55pm on June 10, 2005 at the [[2300 Arena|Alhambra Arena]], formerly known unofficially as the ECW Arena, in [[South Philadelphia]]; this was two days before the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] produced/promoted [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand 2005]] reunion show that was held in [[New York City]]. The show was preceded by a fan [[tailgate party]] in front of the former ECW Arena, with several wrestlers in attendance. This was reminiscent of territorial wrestling in the 1980s, when many [[Independent circuit|independent]] [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotions]] would hold [[barbecue]]s before and after the event.

None of the former [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] performers under contract to WWE appeared at the event (nor the latter three events which soon followed), although [[Mick Foley]], a retired worker who wasn't under contract to [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] at the time, made an unannounced appearance. Former [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] ring announcers Bob Artese (referred to in the DVD's on-screen graphics as "Bob Ortiz") and Stephen DeAngelis worked the event, as did former [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] referees John Finnegan, Mike Kehner and John "Pee Wee" Moore and former [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] timekeeper Rocco Musciano.

Following the success of the inaugural event, Hardcore Homecoming launched an "Extreme Reunion Tour" in the month of September. Originally, the tour was supposed to produce three shows, but the September 17 show in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] was shut down just days before the tour started; it is believed that the promoter was unaware that he needed a promoter's license to run a show in New York. However, the tour did continue with two shows, and would make a return to [[Philadelphia]] on November 5 (billed as ''November Reign'') for what [[Tod Gordon]] has said will stand as the final Hardcore Homecoming show.  However, at an ECW reunion convention, Douglas announced that Hardcore Homecoming would return, first with a 'November to Remember' card in 2009 which would later be renamed ''Legends of the Arena'' and took place on June 27, 2009.

==Forever Hardcore==
''Forever Hardcore'' is a [[professional wrestling]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] that interviews wrestlers who participated on June 10, 2005 Hardcore Homecoming show. It was produced by Big Vision Entertainment and [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#B|booker]] [[Jeremy Borash]] and can be seen as a counterpoint to the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] documentary ''[[The Rise and Fall of ECW]]''.

It is particularly noteworthy for the interviews with [[Shane Douglas]], [[The Sandman (wrestler)|Sandman]], and [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]], wrestlers who were integral to the history of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] but who were not featured on ''The Rise and Fall of ECW'' because they weren't under contract to WWE. It also featured another ECW alumnus [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] in what was at the time a rare speaking role. Also, in the film, [[New Jack]] admits to attempting to kill [[Vic Grimes]] in the rematch to their notorious [[scaffold match]].

The two disc set also includes bonus matches from former ECW wrestlers who competed in the now-defunct [[Xtreme Pro Wrestling|XPW]]. It was also released on April 30, 2007 for sale in Europe on region 2 DVD.

==Home video==
Unlike One Night Stand 2005, the June 10, 2005 Hardcore Homecoming event was not broadcast on [[pay-per-view]]. A two-disc [[DVD]] set of the show was released in August 2005 through the promotion's website, and Big Vision Entertainment later released a "Platinum Edition" of the event commercially, coinciding with the commercial release of ''[[Forever Hardcore]]''. The broadcast was released in Europe on Region 2 DVD on April 30, 2007. [[Joey Styles]] was present at the event and provided [[play-by-play]] for the DVD release.

The second (and final) Philadelphia show from November 2005 was released in early 2006, with a Platinum Edition of it released by Big Vision Entertainment in May 2006. Buck Woodward and [[Eric Gargiulo]] were both present at the November 5, 2005 event and provided [[play-by-play]] and [[color commentary]] for the show's [[webcast]] and DVD release. The Platinum Edition does not feature the Sabu/Funk vs. Team 3D match, as Team 3D's contract with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] prohibits them from appearing on non-TNA video releases. However, the Platinum Edition does feature many bonus matches from independent shows in the early 1990s, [[Xtreme Pro Wrestling|XPW]] and matches from the second show on Hardcore Homecoming's reunion tour. A bootleg edition of this event featuring the Sabu/Funk vs. Team 3D match can be purchased from RF Video and Highspots.com.

Footage of both shows from the Reunion tour were released later in 2005, as the entire Cleveland show was released through the promotion's website, as well as through former ECW videographer RF Video. Despite being advertised for future release, the Monaca show has yet to be released in its entirety. However, 4 of the 6 matches from the show were released as bonus features on the commercially released 'November Reign' DVD, with the Dog-Collar and Stairway to Hell matches being omitted from inclusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="97120">'''International relations  (1919–1939)''' covers the main interactions shaping world history in this era, with emphasis on diplomacy and economic relations. The coverage here follows [[Diplomatic history of World War I]] and precedes [[Diplomatic history of World War II]]. The important stages of interwar diplomacy and international relations included resolutions of wartime issues, such as reparations owed by Germany and boundaries; American involvement in European finances and disarmament projects; the expectations and failures of the [[League of Nations]]; the relationships of the new countries to the old; the distrustful relations of the [[Soviet Union]] to the capitalist world; peace and disarmament efforts; responses to the [[Great Depression]] starting in 1929; the collapse of world trade; the collapse of democratic regimes one by one; the growth of economic autarky; Japanese aggressiveness toward China; Fascist diplomacy, including the aggressive moves by Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany; the [[Spanish Civil War]]; the [[appeasement]] of Germany's expansionist moves toward the Rhineland, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, and the last, desperate stages of rearmament as another world war increasingly loomed.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Rich, ''Great Power Diplomacy since 1914'' (2003) pp 70-248.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Diplomatic history of World War I|Aftermath of World War I|Interwar period|International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)}}

==Peace and disarmament==
There were no great wars in the 1920s. There were a few small wars on the periphery that generally ended by 1922 and did not threaten to escalate. The exceptions included the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917-22, [[Polish–Soviet War]] of 1919-21, the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1919-22, and some civil wars as in Ireland. Instead, the ideals of peace is a theme that dominated the foreign affairs of all major nations in the 1920s. British Labour leader and Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] Was especially articulate:
&lt;blockquote&gt;So soon as you aim at a guarantee by a body like the League of Nations you minimize and subordinate the military value of the pact and raise to a really effective standard the moral guarantees that flow from Conciliation, arbitration, impartial, and judicial judgment exercised by the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A.J.P. Taylor|title=English History, 1914-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sb0RDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA217|year=1965|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===League of Nations===
The main institution intended to bring peace and stability and resolve disputes was the [[League of Nations]], created in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allan Todd|title=The Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlw30T44PS0C&amp;pg=PA58|year=2001|pages=52–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The League was weakened by the non-participation of the United States, Germany and the Soviet Union and (later) of Japan. It could not handle the refusal of major countries, especially Japan and Italy, to accept adverse decisions. Historians agree it was ineffective in major disputes.&lt;ref&gt;F.P. Walters, ''A History of the League of Nations'' (Oxford UP, 1965).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[C. L. Mowat]], ed. ''The New Cambridge Modern History, Vol. 12: 1898-1945'' (1968) pp 242-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of international crises strained the League to its limits, the earliest being the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]].  Japan was censured and quit the League.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hill Nish, ''Japan's Struggle with Internationalism: Japan, China, and the League of Nations, 1931-3'' (Routledge, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; This was soon followed by the [[Abyssinian Crisis]] of 1934-36, in which Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded]] [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] (Abyssinia), one of the two independent African nations. The League tried to enforce economic sanctions upon Italy, but to no avail. The incident highlighted French and British weaknesses, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose it as a counterweight against Hitler's Germany. The limited actions taken by the Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s Germany.&lt;ref&gt;George W. Baer, "Sanctions and security: The League of Nations and the Italian–Ethiopian war, 1935–1936." ''International Organization'' 27#2 (1973): 165-179.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Abyssinian war showed the world how ineffective the League was at solving 
disputes. It played no role in dealing with the [[Spanish Civil War]]. There were also other smaller conflicts that major European nations were involved in, such as the [[Rif War]] between Spain and Morocco spearatists, that the League could not resolve.&lt;ref&gt;Pablo La Porte, "'Rien à ajouter': The League of Nations and the Rif War (1921—1926)," ''European History Quarterly'' (2011) 41#1 pp 66–87, [http://ehq.sagepub.com/content/41/1/66 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disarmament===
{{main|Washington Naval Conference}}
The [[Washington Naval Conference]],  also called the Washington Arms Conference or the Washington Disarmament Conference, was a military conference called by U.S. President [[Warren G. Harding]] and held in Washington, under the Chairmanship of Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]] from 12 November 1921 to 6 February 1922. Conducted outside the auspice of the League of Nations, it was attended by nine nations: the United States, Japan, China, France, Great Britain, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Portugal.  [[Soviet Union|Soviet Russia]] was not invited. The conference focused on resolving misunderstandings or conflicts regarding interests in the Pacific Ocean and East Asia. The main achievement was a series of naval disarmament postals agreed to by all the participants, which lasted for a decade. These resulted in three major treaties – [[Four-Power Treaty]], [[Five-Power Treaty]] (the ''Washington Naval Treaty''), the [[Nine-Power Treaty]] – and a number of smaller agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Buckley, ''The United States and the Washington Conference, 1921-1922'' (U of Tennessee Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. O'Connor, "The" Yardstick" and Naval Disarmament in the 1920's." ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 45.3 (1958): 441-463. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1889320 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain now took the lead. The successful [[London Naval Treaty]] of 1930 continued the warship limitations among the major powers first set out in 1922. The treaties of 1922-30 preserved peace during the 1920s but were not renewed, as the world scene turned increasingly negative starting in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald E. Powaski|title=Toward an Entangling Alliance: American Isolationism, Internationalism, and Europe, 1901-1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDAoVZqHwocC&amp;pg=PA53|year=1991|pages=53-54}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;B. J. C. McKercher, "The politics of naval arms limitation in Britain in the 1920s." ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 4#3 (1993): 35-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The peaceful spirit of Locarno===
{{main|Locarno Treaties}}
The seven international treaties negotiated at Locarno in 1925 by the major powers in Europe (not including the Soviet Union) significantly strengthened the legitimacy of Germany, paving the way to its return to the role of a major power and membership in the League of Nations in 1926, with a permanent seat on its council. The Locarno Treaties marked a dramatic improvement in the political climate of western European in 1924–1930. They promoted expectations for continued peaceful settlements, often called the "spirit of Locarno". This spirit was made concrete when Germany joined the League in 1926, and the withdrawal of Allied troops occupying Germany's [[Rhineland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bo Stråth|title=Europe's Utopias of Peace: 1815, 1919, 1951|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sMY7CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT398|year=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Sally Marks says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Henceforth the spirit of Locarno would reign, substituting conciliation for enforcement as the basis for peace. Yet for some peace remained a desperate hope rather than an actuality. A few men knew that the spirit of Locarno was a fragile foundation on which to build a lasting peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sally Marks|title=The Illusion of Peace: International Relations in Europe 1918-1933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5OonBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT89|year=2003|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nazi Germany had no use for a peaceful spirit. It repudiated Locarno by sending troops into the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|demilitarized Rhineland]] on 7 March 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Gaynor Johnson,  ''Locarno Revisited: European Diplomacy 1920-1929'' (2004) [https://www.amazon.com/Locarno-Revisited-Diplomacy-1920-1929-Diplomats/dp/0714656550/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outlawing war===
{{main|Kellogg–Briand Pact}}
[[File:Kellogg–Briand Pact (1928).jpg|thumb|Fourteen major nations were the first to sign the Kellogg-Briand Pact in Paris in 1928]]

The Kellogg–Briand Pact of 1928 was a proposal drafted by the United States and France that, in effect, outlawed war to resolve "disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them". Most nations readily signed up and used the occasion to promote the goal of peaceful foreign policies. The only issue was the actual formula of the renunciation of all wars – the French wanted the definition restricted to wars of aggression, while the Americans insisted it should include all kinds of warfare. Historian Harold Josephson notes that the Pact has been ridiculed for its moralism and legalism and lack of influence on foreign policy. He argues that it instead led to a more activist American foreign policy. Its central provisions renouncing the use of war, and promoting peaceful settlement of disputes and the use of collective force to prevent aggression, were incorporated into the UN Charter and other treaties. Although civil wars continued, wars between established states have been rare since 1945, with a few exceptions in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Josephson, ''Diplomatic History'' (1979) 3#4 pp 377-390.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, much energetic grass-roots support came from women's organizations and Protestant churches.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Moats Miller, "The Attitudes of the Major Protestant Churches in America toward War and Peace, 1919-1929." ''Historian'' (1956) 19#1 pp 13-38. 26p. Argues that by 1917 the Protestant leaders saw the necessity of a war to end all war; They accepted the Treaty of Versailles and promoted the League of Nations. In the 1920s, there emerged and extensive disarmament and internationalist movement which peaked with their optimism over the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminalizing poison gas===
Realistic critics understood that war could not really be outlawed, but its worst excesses might be banned. Poison gas became the focus of a worldwide crusade in the 1920s.  Poison gas did not win battles, and the generals did not want it. The soldiers hated it far more intensely than bullets or explosive shells. By 1918 chemical shells made up 35 per cent of French ammunition supplies, 25 per cent of British and 20 per cent of the American stock. The “Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous, or Other Gases and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare” ["Geneva Protocol"] was issued in 1925, and was accepted as policy by all major countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Croddy|author2=James J. Wirtz|title=Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlNgS70OHAC&amp;pg=PA140|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tim Cook,  "‘Against God-Inspired Conscience’: The Perception of Gas Warfare as a Weapon of Mass Destruction, 1915–1939." War &amp; Society 18.1 (2000): 47-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
===Great Britain===
{{main|History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom}}
{{further|Timeline of British diplomatic history|History of the United Kingdom}}
Britain was a troubled giant that was less of a dominant diplomatic force in the 1920s than before. It often had to give way to the United States, which frequently exercised its financial superiority.&lt;ref&gt;F.S. Northedge, ''The troubled giant: Britain among the great powers, 1916-1939'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;  The main themes of British foreign policy include a role at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, where Prime Minister Lloyd George worked hard to moderate French demands for revenge.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Goldstein, ''Winning the peace: British diplomatic strategy, peace planning, and the Paris Peace Conference, 1916-1920'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; He was partly successful, but Britain repeatedly had to restrain the French regarding Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Barros, "Disarmament as a weapon: Anglo-French relations and the problems of enforcing German disarmament, 1919–28."

Politically the coalition government headed by Liberal David Lloyd George depended primarily on Conservative Party support. He increasingly antagonized his supporters with foreign policy miscues. The [[Chanak Crisis]] of 1922 brought Britain to the brink of war with Turkey, but the Dominions were opposed and the British military was hesitant, so peace was preserved, but Lloyd George lost control of the coalition and was replaced as prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain between the Wars 1918-1940'' (1955) pp 116-19, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Laird, "Wars Averted: Chanak 1922, Burma 1945–47, Berlin 1948," ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' (1996) 19#3 pp 343-364.&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain maintained close relationships with France and the United States, rejected isolationism, and sought world peace through naval arms limitation treaties,&lt;ref&gt;B. J. C. McKercher, "The politics of naval arms limitation in Britain in the 1920s." ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 4#3 (1993): 35-59.&lt;/ref&gt; and peace with Germany through the Locarno treaties of 1925. A main goal was to restore Germany to a peaceful, prosperous state.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Magee, "‘Limited Liability’? Britain and the Treaty of Locarno." ''Twentieth Century British History'' 6.1 (1995): 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dominions (Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand) achieved virtual independence in foreign policy in 1931, though each depended heavily upon British naval protection. After 1931 trade policy favoured the Commonwealth with tariffs against the U.S. and others. Relations with the independent Irish Free State remained chilly, with a trade war underway in 1932-37.&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars 1918-1940'' (1955) pp 346, 426-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The success at Locarno in handling the German question impelled Foreign Secretary [[Austen Chamberlain]], working with France and Italy, to find a master solution to the diplomatic problems of Eastern Europe and the Balkans. It proved impossible to overcome mutual antagonisms, because Chamberlain's program was flawed by his misperceptions and fallacious judgments.&lt;ref&gt;Dragan Bakić,  "‘Must Will Peace’: The British Brokering of ‘Central European’ and ‘Balkan Locarno’, 1925–9." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 48.1 (2013): 24-56. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23488335 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Disarmament was high on the agenda, and Britain played a major role following the  United States in the [[Washington Naval Conference]] of 1921 in working toward naval disarmament of the major powers.  By 1933 disarmament had collapsed and the issue became rearming for a war against Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. O'Connor, "The" Yardstick" and Naval Disarmament in the 1920's." ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 45.3 (1958): 441-463. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1889320 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Britain faced a large debt of money it borrowed from the U.S. to fight the war. The U.S. refused to cancel the debt but in 1923 the British renegotiated its £978 million war debt to the US Treasury by promising regular payments of £34 million for ten years then £40 million for 52 years. The idea was for the US to loan money to Germany, which in turn paid reparations to Britain, which in turn paid off its loans from the US government. In 1931 all German payments ended, and in 1932 Britain suspended its payments to the US. The German and British debts were finally repaid after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914–1945'' (1965) pp 202–3, 335&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain supported the American solution to German payments through the [[Dawes Plan]]  and the [[Young Plan]], whereby Germany paid its reparations using money borrowed from New York banks.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick O. Cohrs, ''The unfinished peace after world war 1: America, Britain and the stabilization of Europe, 1919-1932'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sally Marks, "The Myths of Reparations", ''Central European History'', (1978) 11#3 pp 231–255&lt;/ref&gt;

====Labour Party====
In domestic British politics, the fast-rising Labour Party had a distinctive and suspicious foreign policy based on pacifism. Its leaders believed that peace was impossible because of capitalism, secret diplomacy, and the trade in armaments. That is it stressed material factors that ignored the psychological memories of the Great War, and the highly emotional tensions regarding nationalism and the boundaries of the countries.  Nevertheless, party leader [[Ramsay MacDonald]] as  Prime Minister (1924, 1929–35) spent much of his attention on European policies. In his 10 months as Prime Minister 1924 he established the basic tenets of British foreign policy for the next dozen years. He had been a strong opponent of entering First World War, and in the unhappy aftermath many observers thought he had been vindicated. Incessant French demands against Germany annoyed the British leadership, and undermined the bilateral relationship with France. MacDonald made it a matter of high principle to dispense even-handed justice between France and Germany, saying, "let them put their demands. In such a way that Great Britain could say that she supported both sides." &lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''English History: 1914-1945 '' (1965) p 214-17&lt;/ref&gt;  MacDonald played a key role in enabling acceptance of the Dawes plan, and worked hard make the League of Nations dream a reality.  In his 10 months as Prime Minister in 1924, he set the course of British foreign policy&lt;ref&gt;Henry R. Winkler, "The Emergence of a Labor Foreign Policy in Great Britain, 1918-1929." ''Journal of Modern History'' 28.3 (1956): 247-258. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1876236 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald, and his Labor Party had a strong record of fighting communists for control union activities. In foreign affairs, however, he came to a détente with Russia and officially recognized it in 1924. A frustrating issue was repayment of British loans to Russia during the war; Moscow said it would pay only if given a loan. There was strong opposition inside Britain, so discussion focused on a commercial treaty with Russia. Just days before the 1924 general election, the media released [[Zinoviev letter|a bombshell document]] signed by [[Grigory Zinoviev]], the head of the [[Communist International]] (COMINTERN) in Moscow, ordering the British Communist Party to engage in all sorts of seditious activities. Historians agree the letter was a clever forgery, and that it disrupted the campaign, but that it did not decide the election, which was won by the Conservatives.  The most negative impact on Labour was hits post-election focus on trickery rather than hits own structural weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''English History: 1914-1945 '' (1965) p 217-20, 225-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Great Depression====
The [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom]] starting in 1929 put enormous pressure on the British economy. Britain move toward imperial preference, which meant low tariffs among the Commonwealth of Nations, and higher barriers toward trade with outside countries.  The flow of money from New York dried up, and the system of reparations and payment of debt died in 1931.

====Appeasement of Germany and Italy====
{{Further|Appeasement|Neville Chamberlain's European Policy}}
Vivid memories of the horrors and deaths of the World War inclined many Britons—and their leaders in all parties—to pacifism in the interwar era. This led directly to the appeasement of dictators in order to avoid their threats of war.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Finney, "The romance of decline: The historiography of appeasement and British national identity." ''Electronic Journal of International History'' 1 (2000). [http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/3385/1/Journal_of_International_History_2000-06_Finney.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenge came from dictators, first [[Benito Mussolini]] of Italy, then [[Adolf Hitler]] of a much more powerful [[Nazi Germany]]. The League of Nations proved disappointing to its supporters; it was unable to resolve any of the threats posed by the dictators.  British policy was to "appease" them in the hopes they would be satiated. By 1938 it was clear that war was looming, and that Germany had the world's most powerful military. The final act of appeasement came when Britain and France sacrificed Czechoslovakia to Hitler's demands at the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Faber (politician)|David Faber]], ''Munich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of satiation Hitler menaced Poland, and at last Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] dropped appeasement and stood firm in promising to defend Poland. Hitler, however, cut a deal with [[Joseph Stalin]] to divide Eastern Europe; when Germany did invade Poland in September 1939, Britain and France declared war; the British Commonwealth followed London's lead.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Cameron Watt, ''How War Came: Immediate Origins of the Second World War, 1938–39'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The main goal of French foreign policy between the wars was the diplomatic response to the demands of the French army in the 1920s and 1930s to form alliances against the German threat, especially with Britain and with smaller countries in central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jackson, "France and the problems of security and international disarmament after the first world war." ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' 29#2 (2006): 247–280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Jordan, "The Reorientation of French Diplomacy in the mid-1920s: the Role of Jacques Seydoux." ''English Historical Review'' 117.473 (2002): 867–888.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1920s====
France was part of the Allied force that [[Occupation of the Rhineland|occupied the Rhineland]] following the Armistice. Foch supported Poland in the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–19)|Greater Poland Uprising]] and in the [[Polish–Soviet War]] and France also joined Spain during the [[Rif War (1920)|Rif War]].  From 1925 until his death in 1932, [[Aristide Briand]], as prime minister during five short intervals, directed French foreign policy, using his diplomatic skills and sense of timing to forge friendly relations with [[Weimar Germany]] as the basis of a genuine peace within the framework of the [[League of Nations]]. He realized France could neither contain the much larger Germany by itself nor secure effective support from Britain or the League.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Weber, ''The Hollow Years: France in the 1930s'' (1996) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1923 as a response to the failure of the German to ship enough coal as part of its reparations, France (and  Belgium) occupied the industrial region of the [[Ruhr]]. Germany responded with passive resistance including printing vast amounts of marks to pay for the occupation, thereby causing runaway inflation. Inflation heavily damaged the German middle class (because their bank accounts became worthless) but it also damaged the French franc. France fomented a separatist movement pointing to an independent buffer state, but it collapsed after some bloodshed.  The intervention was a failure, and in summer 1924 France accepted the American solution to the reparations issues, as expressed in the [[Dawes Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;Conan Fischer, ''The Ruhr Crisis 1923-1924'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, France established an elaborate system of static border defences called the [[Maginot Line]], designed to fight off any German attack. The Maginot Line did not extend into Belgium, where Germany attacked in 1940 and went around the French defenses.  Military alliances were signed with weak powers in 1920–21, called the "[[Little Entente]]".&lt;ref&gt;William Allcorn, ''The Maginot Line 1928–45'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

====1930s====
{{Further|Interwar France}}
Appeasement was increasingly adopted as Germany grew stronger after 1933, for France suffered a stagnant economy, unrest in its colonies, and bitter internal political fighting.  Appeasement say Martin Thomas was not a coherent diplomatic strategy nor a copying of the British.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Thomas,  "Appeasement in the Late Third Republic," ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 19#3 (2008): 566–607.&lt;/ref&gt;  France appeased Italy on the Ethiopia question because it could not afford to risk an alliance between Italy and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds M. Salerno, "The French Navy and the Appeasement of Italy, 1937-9," ''English Historical Review'' 112#445 (1997): 66–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hitler sent troops into the Rhineland—the part of Germany where no troops were allowed—neither Paris nor London would risk war, and nothing was done.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Schuker, "France and the Remilitarization of the Rhineland, 1936," ''French Historical Studies'' 14.3 (1986): 299–338.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Appeasement]] of Germany, in cooperation with Britain,  was the policy after 1936, as France sought peace even in the face of Hitler's escalating demands.    [[Édouard Daladier]] refused to go to war against Germany and Italy without British support as [[Neville Chamberlain]] wanted to save peace using the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Thomas|title=Britain, France and Appeasement: Anglo-French Relations in the Popular Front Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJXqvBz3JHcC&amp;pg=PA137|year=1996|publisher=Berg|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Larkin, ''France since the Popular Front: Government and People, 1936–1986'' (1988) pp 63-81&lt;/ref&gt;  France's military alliance with Czechoslovakia was sacrificed at Hitler's demand when France and Britain agreed to his terms at [[Munich Agreement|Munich]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Jordan, "Léon Blum and Czechoslovakia, 1936–1938." ''French History'' 5#1 (1991): 48–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Thomas, "France and the Czechoslovak crisis," ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 10.23 (1999): 122–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blum government joined Britain in establishing an arms embargo during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39). Blum rejected support for the Spanish Republicans because of his fear that civil war might spread to deeply divided France. As the Republican cause faltered in Spain, Blum secretly supplied it the Republican cause with arms, funds and sanctuaries.  Financial support in military cooperation with Poland was also a policy. The government nationalized arms suppliers, and dramatically increased its program of rearming the French military in a last-minute catch up with the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Larkin, ''France since the Popular Front,'' (1988) pp 45-62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fascism===
{{main|Fascism in Europe}}
Fascism is a form of radical [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[nationalism]] in Europe shortly after the First World War. It dominated Italy (1923–43) and Nazi Germany (1933-45) and played a role in other countries. It was based in tightly organised local groups, all controlled from the top.  It violently opposed to [[liberalism]], [[Marxism]], and [[anarchism]], and tried to control all aspects of society.  The foreign policy Militaristic and aggressive. Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany were critical allies in the second world war.  Japan, with an authoritarian government that did not have a well-mobilised popular base, was allied with them to form the Axis.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. The advent of [[total war]] and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants. A "military citizenship" arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner during the war. The war had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines and providing economic production and logistics to support them, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mann. ''Fascists''. Cambridge UP, 2004 p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascists argue that [[liberal democracy]] is obsolete, and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[one-party state]] as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties.  Opposition parties or organizations or publications are not tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;John Horne. ''State, Society and Mobilization in Europe During the First World War''. pp. 237–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a state is led by a strong leader—such as a dictator his fascist party—to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society without dissent.  Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature, and views political violence and warfare as tools that can achieve national rejuvenation.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945'' p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler re-militarised Germany's Rhineland district in 1936 in defiance of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] which said no troops would be stationed there. France and Britain did nothing.&lt;ref&gt;R.A.C. Parker, "The first capitulation: France and the Rhineland crisis of 1936." ''World Politics'' 8#3 (1956): 355-373.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hitler discovered  that [[Events preceding World War II in Europe|threats and bold moves paid off]], and he escalated demands against Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Finally Britain and France declared war after his [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939. The  [[World War II|Second World War]] had begun.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Overy and Andrew Wheatcroft, ''The road to war'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{Main|Weimar Republic}}
Germany, stripped of its overseas colonies, its Polish regions in the east and Alsace-Lorraine in the West, became a republic in 1919. It was committed to democracy and modernity, but faced internal challenges from the far left and the far right, and external pressures from France.

====Weimar Germany (1919–1933)====
{{main|German Revolution of 1918–19}}
In November 1918, the Kaiser and the aristocracy, were overthrown. [[Friedrich Ebert]], leader of the Socialists (the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] or SPD) became Chancellor of Germany, serving until his death in 1923. His moderate faction of the SPD expelled the radical element led by [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]]. They went on to form a Communist Party, seeking the violent overthrow of the government in the name of the working class. In January 1919, Communists led the [[Spartacist uprising]] in Berlin, Bremen, Braunschweig, and the Ruhr. The Army was largely demobilized, but many veterans volunteered to form [[Freikorps]] ("free corps") which supported Ebert and his defense minister [[Gustav Noske]]. They easily crushed the poorly organized uprisings. Liebknecht and Luxemburg were killed, leading to a permanent breach between Socialist and Communists that was never healed.&lt;ref&gt;W.C. Mathews, "The Economic Origins of the Noskepolitik." ''Central European History'' 27#1 (1994): 65–86. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4546391 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;  In Bavaria a Communist revolt created the short lived [[Bavarian Socialist Republic]] on 6 April 1919. It was suppressed by the Army and the Freikorps the following month.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon A. Craig, ''Germany 1866-1945'' (1978) pp 396-433. [https://www.questia.com/library/4002835/germany-1866-1945 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Reparations=====
{{Main|World War I reparations}}
The Versailles Treaty required Germany to pay reparations for the damage it did during the war. Germany tried to avoid the obligation, but France used military force and occupied German industrial areas, making reparations the "chief battleground of the post-war era" and "the focus of the power struggle between France and Germany over whether the Versailles Treaty was to be enforced or revised".&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Henig, ''Versailles and After: 1919–1933'' (1984) p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sharp. "The Enforcement of the Treaty of Versailles, 1919–1923." ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 16.3 (2005): 423–438.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the 1921 London Schedule of Payments required Germany to pay 132&amp;nbsp;billion [[German gold mark|gold marks]] {{nowrap|({{USD|33 billion}})}} in reparations to cover civilian damage caused during the war. This figure was divided into three categories of [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]: A, B, and C. Of these, Germany was only required to pay towards 'A' and 'B' bonds totaling 50 billion marks ({{USD|12.5 billion}}). The remaining 'C' bonds, which Germany did not have to pay, were designed to deceive the Anglo-French public into believing Germany was being heavily fined and punished for the war.

Because of the lack of reparation payments by Germany, France [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Ruhr]] in 1923 to enforce payments, causing an international crisis. It was resolved by American intervention in the form of the [[Dawes Plan]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick O. Cohrs, ''The Unfinished Peace after World War I: America, Britain and the Stabilisation of Europe, 1919–1932'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; This plan set out a new payment method. New York banks loaned Germany money that was used to pay reparations and rebuild its heavy industry. Despite this, by 1928 Germany called for a new payment plan, resulting in the [[Young Plan]] that established the German reparation requirements at 112 billion marks ({{USD|26.3 billion}}) and created a schedule of payments that would see Germany complete payments by 1988. With the collapse of the German economy in 1931, reparations were [[Hoover Moratorium|suspended for a year]] and in 1932 during the [[Lausanne Conference of 1932|Lausanne Conference]] they were cancelled altogether. Between 1919 and 1932, Germany paid less than 21 billion marks in reparations. After 1953 West Germany [[London Agreement on German External Debts|paid the entire remaining balance.]]&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Gomes, ''German Reparations, 1919–1932: A Historical Survey'' (Springer, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The German people saw reparations as a national humiliation; the German Government worked to undermine the validity of the Treaty of Versailles and the requirement to pay. British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] called the treaty a [[Carthaginian peace]] that would economically destroy Germany. His arguments had a profound effect on historians, politicians, and the public at large in Britain and elsewhere. Despite Keynes' arguments and those by later historians supporting or reinforcing Keynes' views, the consensus of contemporary historians is that reparations were not as intolerable as the Germans or Keynes had suggested and were within Germany's capacity to pay had there been the political will to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre Brouâe|title=The German Revolution, 1917–1923|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-qkwPz5TwgC&amp;pg=PA350|year=2005|publisher=BRILL|pages=350–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Rapallo and Locarno treaties=====

Apart from the reparations issue, Germany's highest priority was normalizing its relations with its neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;* Nekrich, Aleksandr M. et al. ''Pariahs, Partners, Predators: German-Soviet Relations, 1922–1941'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; The new policy was to turn east for a new friendship with the communist Soviet Union In 1922, they signed the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)|Treaty of Rapallo]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Himmer, "Rathenau, Russia, and Rapallo."

====Nazi Germany (1933–1945)====
{{main|Nazi Germany|Adolf Hitler}}
Hitler and his Nazis turned Germany into a dictatorship with a highly hostile outlook toward the Treaty of Versailles and Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Evans, ''The Third Reich in Power'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; It solved its unemployment crisis by heavy military spending.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Tooze]], ''The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler's diplomatic tactics were to make seemingly reasonable demands, then threatening war if they were not met; concessions were made, he accepted them and moved onto a new demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Record|title=The Specter of Munich: Reconsidering the Lessons of Appeasing Hitler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aV0B4_cBkc0C&amp;pg=PA106|year=2007|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the League of Nations (1933), rejected the Versailles Treaty and began to re-arm (1935) with the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]], won back the Saar (1935), re-militarized the Rhineland (1936), formed an alliance ("axis") with Mussolini's Italy (1936), sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), seized Austria (1938), took over Czechoslovakia after the British and French appeasement of the Munich Agreement of 1938, formed a peace pact with Stalin's Russia in August 1939, and finally invaded Poland in September 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II, 1937–1939'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

====1933–1935====
Hitler and the leading Nazis had little diplomatic experience before they came to power in January 1933, and they moved slowly in that arena. While the concentrated on a total takeover of the power centers inside Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler’s Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933–36'' (1970) pp 25–56&lt;/ref&gt; The first external move was to cripple a disarmament conference that was underway in Geneva, by rejecting troop limitations. The Germans insisted that the Nazi storm troopers should not be counted in any quota system. Although Britain, France, Italy and the United States were ready to freeze armaments for four years, the Germans insisted on having "defensive weapons" immediately.

Germany quit the disarmament conference and the League in October 1933 but even then few European leaders (apart from Winston Churchill) saw Hitler as an enemy or threat to peace. For example, [[Eric Phipps]] the British ambassador 1933–1937 eagerly promoted policies, later known as [[appeasement]]. He believed that the League of Nations Was the key to preventing the next war, and tried to enlist the French in efforts to get the Germans to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;Gaynor Johnson, "Sir Eric Phipps, the British government, and the appeasement of Germany, 1933–1937." ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 16.4 (2005): 651–669.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini was also eager to cooperate with Hitler, and succeeded in getting the German signature on the Four-Power Pact, between Britain, France, Italy, and Germany. The Pact failed, and after Hitler visited Mussolini in Rome, they had a falling out German intentions to take over Austria. Britain and France tried for the next several years to attract Italy more to their side than to Germany's.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron L. Goldman, "Sir Robert Vansittart's Search for Italian Cooperation against Hitler, 1933–36," ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 9#3 (1974), pp. 93–130 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/26002 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1934 Germany signed a [[German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact|non-aggression pact with Poland]], which disrupted the French network of anti-German alliances in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler’s Germany'' pp 57–74&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1935 Hitler denounced the requirement of German disarmament contained in the Versailles Treaty of 1919. Germany and Britain came to terms in June 1935, in the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]]. Germany promised to limit or naval expansion to 35 percent of the British, thereby driving a wedge between Britain and France.&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Gathorne-Hardy, ''Short History of International Affairs, 1920‐1939'' (3rd ed. 1942) pp 347–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans had a deep negative attitude toward Hitler and the Nazis, and relations steadily deteriorated over trade disputes, anti-Jewish demonstrations, and rearmament.  Washington decided that German foreign policy primarily reflected two factors: its internal economic problems and Hitler's expansionist dreams. Meanwhile, the new Roosevelt administration opened relations with the Soviet Union on a basis of détente, along with the promise there would be no espionage.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Moss, "George S. Messersmith and Nazi Germany: the diplomacy of limits in Central Europe." in Kenneth Paul Jones  ed., ''US Diplomats in Europe: 1919–1941'' (2nd ed. 1983) pp 113–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Europe===

A major result of the First World War was the breakup of the Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman empires, as well as partial losses to the German Empire. A surge of ethnic nationalism created a series of new states in Eastern Europe, validated by the [[Versailles Treaty of 1919]]. [[History of Ukraine#Ukraine and World Wars|Ukraine]], Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan tried to do the same but were later retaken by the Bolsheviks in Russia. Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia became entirely new nations. Austria and Hungary survived with much smaller territories based on their German and Hungarian core populations.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Seton-Watson, ''Eastern Europe Between the Wars, 1918-1941'' (1945)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Second Polish Republic|Poland was reconstituted]] after the [[Partitions of Poland|partitions of the 1790s]] had divided it between Germany, Austria, and Russia.  Romania, Bulgaria and Albania survive the tumbled, but their borders were adjusted. All the countries were heavily rural, with little industry and only a few urban centers. Nationalism was the dominant force but most of the countries had ethnic or religious minorities who felt threatened by majority elements. Nearly all became democratic in the 1920s, but all of them (except Czechoslovakia and Finland) gave up democracy during the depression years of the 1930s, in favor of autocratic or strong-man or single party states. The new states were unable to form stable military alliances, and one by one were too weak to stand up against Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, which took them over between 1938 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;E. Garrison Walters, ''The Other Europe: Eastern Europe to 1945'' (Syracuse UP, 1988) covers seven countries.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baltic states====
{{Main|Baltic states|History of Estonia|History of Latvia|History of Lithuania}}
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania successfully broke away from Russia in 1918-1920 and became independent countries. Bolshevik radicals at first held power, especially in Latvia, but were replaced during the 1920s with conservative political coalitions based on ethnic nationalism. The population in the early 1920s ranged from 1.1 million in Estonia, and 1.8 million in Latvia, to 2.2 million in Lithuania.  Minorities comprised 12% of the population of Estonia, 27% in Latvia, and 20% in Lithuania. Each was heavily rural, especially Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Smith, ed.|title=The Baltic States: The National Self-Determination of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dy-DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7|year=2016|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each privileged its main ethnic majority and its language and religion. They all had to deal with a mosaic of minorities: Germans, Jews, Belorussians, Russians, and Poles. The minorities had different languages, religions, and cultures.  The Germans generally were the main landowners. There were outside attempts to incite separatist movements, with little success. The Baltic governments limited the rights and privileges of the minorities, but the minorities had enough solidarity to resist assimilation. These attempts caused an unfavorable international reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Łossowski, "National Minorities in the Baltic States 1919-1940." ''Acta Poloniae Historica'' 25 (1972): 87-107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Poland's seizure of Vilnius outraged the Lithuanians and made impossible any coordination or diplomatic cooperation among the three countries.&lt;ref&gt;Olav Fagelund Knudsen, "The Foreign Policies of the Baltic States: Interwar Years and Restoration' ''Cooperation and Conflict'' (1993)  28#1  pp 47-72; DOI10.1177/0010836793028001003&lt;/ref&gt;

All three survived until 1939-40, when they were taken over by the Soviet Union and the local leadership was suppressed, executed or escaped into exile. The Germans invaded in 1941 and were expelled in 1944.  After additional purges large numbers of Russians were resettled in Estonia and Latvia, and smaller numbers in Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ed., ''The Baltic States: The National Self-Determination of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania'' (1996) pp 1-69 [https://www.amazon.com/Baltic-States-National-Self-Determination-Lithuania/dp/0312161921/  excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
[[File:Ionia within Greece (1919).svg|thumb|250px|Greek troops occupied Smyrna area and also areas north of Constantinople.]]
In [[History of Greece|Greece]], the site of several [[revanchism|revanchist]] wars in the years prior to the First World War, the divided international loyalties of the political elite reached a crisis over entering the World War against its historic enemy, the [[Ottoman Empire]].  During what was known as the [[National Schism]], a pro-British, liberal and nationalist movement led by [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] struggled with the conservative and pro-German monarch [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] for control.

[[Occupation of Smyrna|Greek troops seized Smyrna and a large sector of western Anatonia]] in 1919. They had British support. In 1920 the Ottoman government agreed to the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]; it stipulated that in five years time a plebiscite would be held in Smyrna on whether the region would join Greece. However, [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish nationalists]], led by [[Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], overthrew the Ottoman government and organised tried to expel the Greeks in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]]. A major Greek offensive ground to a halt in 1921, and by 1922 Greek troops were in retreat. The Turkish forces recaptured Smyrna and drove out all the Greek forces. The war with Turkey ended with an agreement to stage massive ethnic exchange, with 1.1 million ethnic Greek Christians who had lived in what was now Turkey (and perhaps could not speak Greek) moving back to Greece, and 380,000 Muslims moving to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Clogg|title=A Concise History of Greece |edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-YELAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=96–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hungary====
{{Further|Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary between the World Wars|Treaty of Trianon|Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)}}
In the chaos of 1919 Hungarian Communists, encouraged by Moscow, overthrew the government and established the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]on 21 March 1919. [[Béla Kun]] was officially the foreign minister but in practice was the new leader. His regime nationalized industry and finance but made the mistake of not redistributing land to the peasants. The plan was to establish a large-scale collective farms managed by the old landlord class.  Dissent grew but was violently suppressed in the [[Red Terror (Hungary)|Red Terror]]. Hungary was soon at war with Romania and Czechoslovakia, both aided by France, and the regime collapsed in August 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Istvan  Deak, "Budapest and the Hungarian Revolutions of 1918-1919." ''Slavonic and East European Review'' 46.106 (1968): 129-140. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4205930 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The "white" counter-revolutionaries, rooted in the landowning class, came to power under Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]], an authoritarian ruler from 1920 to his arrest in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas L. Sakmyster]], ''Hungary's Admiral on Horseback: Miklós Horthy, 1918-1944'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. G. Walters, ''The Other Europe: Eastern Europe To 1945'' (1988) pp 205-18.&lt;/ref&gt;   They used force to suppress the remnants of the revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Emily R. Gioielli, "'White Misrule': Terror and Political Violence During Hungary’s Long World War I, 1919-1924. (PhD Diss. Central European University, 2015) [http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2015/gioielli_emily.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]], Hungary lost a great deal of historic territory and resources, with many ethnic Hungarians now located in other countries. Ethnic Hungarians wanted a restoration of their status.  Hungarians stranded elsewhere formed organizations to maintain their identity, such as  Czechoslovakia's St. George Scout Circle (later called "Sarló" ) and Romania's Transylvanian Youth (Erdélyi Fiatalok).&lt;ref&gt;Deborah S. Cornelius, "The Impact of Trianon: Intellectual and Activist Movements." ''Hungarian Studies Review.'' 39.1-2 (2012): 75+.&lt;/ref&gt;  One result was closeness to fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, which promised to restore lost territories.

===Soviet Union===
Soviet foreign policy went through a series of stages.&lt;ref&gt;Adam B. Ulam, ''Expansion and coexistence: Soviet foreign policy, 1917–73'' (1974) pp 147-208.&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage from late 1917 into 1922 involved defeating foreign interventions, and an internal Civil War. The Soviets maintained control over most of the former Russian Empire, and regained control over the trans-Caucasian republics. They lost Finland, Poland and the Baltics, which remained independent until the Second World War. They regained control of Ukraine in 1921 by defeating Poland in a short, intensive war. There was a short war in 1919–20 with Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jelavich, ''St. Petersburg and Moscow: tsarist and Soviet foreign policy, 1814–1974'' (1974) pp 301-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Flushed with victory, Lenin, Trotsky and the other leaders in Moscow were convinced that they represented the wave of the future, and that with a little help provided by the [[Communist International]] (Comintern), headed by [[Grigory Zinoviev]] they could spark anti-capitalist revolutions across the globe.  However the interventions were all failures. In most cases the insurgents were quickly defeated by the established national forces. A Communist-Socialist coalition came to power in Hungary, with communist [[Béla Kun]] becoming the dictator. The Romanians invaded and overthrew his regime in early August 1919. In Berlin the Communist forces under the [[Spartacus League|Spartacist]] red banner led revolts in Berlin, [[Bavarian Council Republic|Munich]] and the Ruhr that were quickly crushed by the army in a matter of days.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Haslam, "Comintern and Soviet foreign policy, 1919–1941" in Ronald Suny, ed. ''The Cambridge History of Russia: Volume 3, The Twentieth Century'' (2006) pp. 636-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The long series of defeats produced a ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' or chain of buffer states. The USSR had become a pariah state and the second stage was to work around that bad reputation. Its size and economic importance facilitated making trade agreements (which did not include official diplomatic recognition) with Britain, Italy, Austria, Germany, and Norway in 1921. The [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922]] with Germany—another pariah state—opened up trade and recognition. It secretly allowed large-scale military training for German forces in hidden Soviet military installations. The [[New Economic Policy]] (1921–28) allowed a limited capitalism in the USSR and led to invitations to foreign corporations to do business. [[Henry Ford]] and his experts came from Detroit and built modern factories at [[GAZ]]; Ford was convinced that commerce made for peace.

Lenin was incapacitated by 1922 and died in 1924. He was replaced by [[Joseph Stalin]] who rejected the goal of sponsoring Communist uprisings. In 1924 came recognition by Britain, Italy, France and Japan. Stalin removed Zinoniev and purged Trotsky and his hard-line allies who preached world revolution. The first priority, said Stalin, was expressed in the official slogan, "Socialism in One Country." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Gooding|title=Socialism in Russia: Lenin and His Legacy, 1890–1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFGMDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107|year=2001|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 the NEP experiment with capitalism was ended.

Throughout the 1920s, distrust and contention marked Anglo–Soviet relations, culminating in a diplomatic break in 1927.  Britain formally recognised the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR or Soviet Union, 1922–1991) on 1 February 1924. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were severed at the end of May 1927 after a police raid on the [[All Russian Co-operative Society]] whereafter prime minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] presented the House of Commons with deciphered Soviet telegrams that proved Soviet espionage activities.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Andrew, "Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of Mi5"(London, 2009), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an account of the break in 1927, see Roger Schinness, "The Conservative Party and Anglo-Soviet Relations, 1925–27", ''European History Quarterly'' 7, 4 (1977): 393–407.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, the incoming Labour government successfully established permanent diplomatic relations.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Bridges, "Red or Expert? The Anglo–Soviet Exchange of Ambassadors in 1929." Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft 27.3 (2016): 437-452.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Sixth World Congress of the Communist International in 1928, Stalin issued orders that across the world Communist parties would never be allowed to cooperate with Socialists or other leftist parties—they were all "social fascists" and were as evil as the capitalists because they were enemies of the proletariat. Communists infiltrated and tried to seize control of labour unions and the Socialists fought back as hard as they could.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John H. Kautsky|title=Social Democracy and the Aristocracy: Why Socialist Labor Movements Developed in Some Industrial Countries and Not in Others |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U1VRPOPKq64C&amp;pg=PA118|year=2001|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a return to normal relations with nearby states, in 1932 Stalin signed non-aggression treaties with the ''cordon sanitaire'' states of Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, and France.  The USSR joined the League of Nations in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Jelavich, ''St. Petersburg and Moscow''  (1974) pp 311–340.&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States was the last major country to recognize the Soviet state. Recognition in 1933 was popular in the US; businessmen planned for large-scale trade, but it never materialized.&lt;ref&gt;Joan H. Wilson, "American Business and the Recognition of the Soviet Union." ''Social Science Quarterly'' (1971): 349-368. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/42860014 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Popular Front====
{{Main|Popular Front}}
Communists and parties on the left were increasingly threatened by the growth of the Nazi movement. Hitler came to power in January 1933 and rapidly consolidated his control over Germany, destroyed the communist and socialist movements in Germany, and rejected the restraints imposed by the Versailles treaty. Stalin in 1934 reversed his decision in 1928 to attack socialists, and introduced his new plan: the "popular front." It was a coalition of anti-fascist parties usually organized by the local Communists acting under instructions from the Comintern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Trond Gilberg|title=Coalition Strategies of Marxist Parties |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ryleTJzX88C&amp;pg=PA72|year=1989|pages=72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new policy was to work with all parties on the left and center in a multiparty coalition against fascism and Nazi Germany in particular. The new slogan was: "The People's Front Against Fascism and War". Under this policy Communist Parties were instructed to form broad alliances with all anti-fascist parties with the aim of both securing social advance at home and a military alliance with the USSR to isolate the fascist dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McDermott, and Jeremy Agnew, ''The Comintern: A History of International Communism from Lenin to Stalin'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The "Popular Fronts" thus formed proved to be successful in only a few countries, and only for a few years each, forming the government in France, Chile and Spain, and also China.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Jackson, ''The Popular Front in France: Defending Democracy, 1934–38'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; It was not a political success elsewhere. The Popular Front approach played a major role in Resistance movements in France and other countries conquered by Germany after 1939. After the war it played a major role in French and Italian politics.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Graham and Paul Preston, eds. ''The Popular Front in Europe'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H27337, Moskau, Stalin und Ribbentrop im Kreml.jpg|thumb|200px|Stalin and Ribbentrop shaking hands after the signing of the pact in Moscow in August 1939.]]
In 1938–39, the Soviet Union attempted to form strong military alliances with Germany's enemies, including France, and Great Britain. The effort failed, and the last stage unfolded to the astonishment of the world: [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Stalin and Hitler came to terms.]]  Historian [[François Furet]] says, "The pact signed in Moscow by Ribbentrop and Molotov on 23 August 1939 inaugurated the alliance between the USSR and Nazi Germany. It was presented as an alliance and not just a nonaggression pact." The secret covenants agreed on a mutual division of Poland, and split up Eastern Europe, with the USSR taking over the Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=François Furet|title=The Passing of an Illusion: The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giY9sIayZBoC&amp;pg=PA315|year=1999|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The USSR helped supply oil and munitions to Germany as its armies rolled across Western Europe in May–June 1940.  Despite repeated warnings, Stalin refused to believe that Hitler was planning an all-out war on the USSR. It came in June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Oxley|title=Russia, 1855-1991: From Tsars to Commissars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nOO7Z2jRwsC&amp;pg=RA4-PA19|year=2001|publisher=Oxford UP|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ukraine====
Ukraine was a complex ethnic mix, comprising Ukrainians, Russians, Jews, Poles, and other minorities and lacking a strong sense of nationalism. The social, political, cultural, and economic elites were based in the major cities, espoused Russian nationalism, and were generally indifferent or hostile to Ukrainian nationalism. Peasants on the other hand, were strongly in favor of independence in order to redistribute the land. Ukraine tried to break free from Russia after the February 1917 revolution in St. Petersburg. The leadership was young, ideological, hostile to capitalism and landowners, and inexperienced. It did not realize the necessity of a strong army—it turned down a force of 40,000 trained soldiers as unnecessary—nor the need to build infrastructure and public support in the rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Vladyslav Verstiuk,  "Conceptual Issues in Studying the History of the Ukrainian Revolution." ''Journal of Ukrainian Studies'' 24.1 (1999): 5-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside powers acted on entirely different visions for Ukraine. The British ridiculed the pretensions of the new nation.&lt;ref&gt;Natalya Yakovenko, "Ukraine in British strategies and concepts of foreign policy, 1917–1922 and after." ''East European Quarterly'' 36.4 (2002): 465.&lt;/ref&gt; White Russians, united only by their opposition to Bolshevism, wanted to restore Ukraine as a Russian province. Russian Bolsheviks did not believe in nationalism and twice invaded Ukraine in failed efforts to seize control and collectivize the farms; they succeeded the third time in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Tan,  "Transformation versus Tradition: Agrarian Policy and Government–Peasant Relations in Right-Bank Ukraine 1920–1923." ''Europe-Asia Studies'' 52.5 (2000): 915–937.&lt;/ref&gt; Americans were outraged at the large-scale massacres of Jews in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Elias Tcherikower, ''The Pogroms in the Ukraine in 1919'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Germany supported Ukrainian nationalism as a foil to Russia, but its chief goal was to obtain urgently needed food supplies. Ukraine was too poorly organized to fulfill the promised food shipments.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram Dornik and Peter Lieb. "Misconceived realpolitik in a failing state: the political and economical fiasco of the Central Powers in the Ukraine, 1918." ''First World War Studies'' 4.1 (2013): 111–124.&lt;/ref&gt; Poland wanted Ukraine in order to build a population that could stand up against Germany. France wanted Poland as a strong anti-German ally and therefore supported Polish ambitions. Poland did seize Ukraine in 1919, but was driven out in the [[Polish–Soviet War in 1920]].&lt;ref&gt;Oleksandr Pavliuk,  "Ukrainian-Polish relations in Galicia in 1918–1919." ''Journal of Ukrainian Studies'' 23.1 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Orest Subtelny|title=Ukraine: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5uiWHgRphQC&amp;pg=PA359|year=2000|publisher=U of Toronto Press|pages=344–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian  Paul Kubicek states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Between 1917 and 1920, several entities that aspired to be independent Ukrainian states came into existence. This period, however, was extremely chaotic, characterized by revolution, international and civil war, and lack of strong central authority. Many factions competed for power in the area that is today’s Ukraine, and not all groups desired a separate Ukrainian state. Ultimately, Ukrainian independence was short-lived, as most Ukrainian lands were incorporated into the Soviet Union and the remainder, in western Ukraine, was divided among Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kubicek, ''The History of Ukraine'' (2008) p 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A Canadian scholar [[Orest Subtelny]] provides a context from the long span of European history:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1919 total chaos engulfed Ukraine. Indeed, in the modern history of Europe no country experienced such complete anarchy, bitter civil strife, and total collapse of authority as did Ukraine at this time. Six different armies—those of the Ukrainians, the Bolsheviks, the Whites, the Entente [French], the Poles and the anarchists—operated on its territory. Kiev changed hands five times in less than a year. Cities and regions were cut off from each other by the numerous [military] fronts. Communications with the outside world broke down almost completely. The starving cities emptied as people moved into the countryside in their search for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Orest Subtelny|title=Ukraine: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5uiWHgRphQC&amp;pg=PA359|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Ukrainian War of Independence]] of 1917 to 1921 produced the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (in 1919 merged from the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] and [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]) which was quickly subsumed in the [[Soviet Union]].

===Spanish Civil War===
{{Main|Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War}}

The Spanish Civil War exposed political divisions across Europe. The right and the Catholics supported the Nationalists as a way to stop the expansion of [[Bolshevism]]. On the left, including labor unions, students and intellectuals, the war represented a necessary battle to stop the spread of fascism. Antiwar and pacifist sentiment was strong in many countries, leading to warnings that the Civil War had the potential of escalating into a second world war.&lt;ref&gt;Zara Steiner, ''The Triumph of the Dark: European International History 1933–1939'' (2013), pp 181–251.&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, the war was an indicator of the growing instability across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Emanuel Adler and Vincent Pouliot|title=International Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTUX9n1hAZ4C&amp;pg=PA184|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=184–85 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511862373|isbn=9781139501583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish Civil War involved tens of thousands of outsiders from right and left who came to fight.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Alpert, ''A new international history of the Spanish Civil War'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Italy sent infantry regiments; Germany sent its air force.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Corum,  "The Luftwaffe and the coalition air war in Spain, 1936–1939." ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' 18.1 (1995): 68-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communist elements around the world, working through [[Popular Front]] collaborations with anti-fascist parties but supervised by Moscow, sent volunteers to the "International Brigades."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kowalsky, "The Soviet Union and the International Brigades, 1936–1939." ''Journal of Slavic Military Studies'' 19.4 (2006): 681-704.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these volunteers were Communist party members, typically with a dedication of their time, energy, and lives To an idealistic cause.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa A. Kirschenbaum, ''International Communism and the Spanish Civil War: Solidarity and Suspicion'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Many writers and intellectuals on the left became involved, including [[Ernest Hemingway]], who supported the Republican cause, and [[George Orwell]], who reversed himself and turned sharply anti-Communist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Colls|title=George Orwell: English Rebel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EChoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA258|year=2013|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow also sent along a cadre of agents from their secret police force, NKVD and GUM.  Their mission was to enforce solidarity and the party line, and to identify and execute left-wing anarchists whose agenda threatened the Stalinist line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Andrew|title=The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TWUAQ7Xof8C&amp;pg=PA73|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert W.

The Spanish government in 1937 shipped its entire gold supply (worth over $500 million at the time) to Moscow for safekeeping. This gave Stalin leverage over the Spanish government, as he controlled the payments for all sales of arms to Spain. The gold was never returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Burnett Bolloten|title=The Spanish Civil War: Revolution and Counterrevolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0F20CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145|year=2015|publisher=U  of North Carolina Press|pages=145–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain and France led a coalition of 27 nations that promised [[non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War]], including an embargo on all arms to Spain. The United States unofficially went along. Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union signed on officially, but ignored the embargo. The attempted suppression of imported materials was largely ineffective, however, and France especially facilitated large shipments to Republican troops. The [[League of Nations]] did not try to act.

==Latin America==
[[File:Vargas e Roosevelt.jpg|250px|thumb|Brazil's President [[Getúlio Vargas]] (left) meets with U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (right) in 1936, hoping a good relationship with the United States would deter an attack from Argentina.]]

The main foreign policy initiative of the United States was the [[Good Neighbor Policy]], which was a move toward a more non-interventionist U.S. policy in [[Latin America]]. Since the 1890s Americans had seen this region as an American [[sphere of influence]]. American forces were [[United States occupation of Haiti|withdrawn]] from Haiti, and new treaties with Cuba and Panama ended their status as U.S. [[protectorate]]s. In December&amp;nbsp;1933, Roosevelt signed the [[Montevideo Convention]] on the Rights and Duties of States, renouncing the right to intervene unilaterally in the affairs of Latin American countries.  The U.S. repealed the [[Platt Amendment]], freeing Cuba from legal and official interference by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;William E. Leuchtenburg, ''Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, 1932–1940'' (1963).   pp. 203–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Depression in Latin America]] had a devastating impact, as the demand for its raw materials drastically declined, undermining the critical export sector.  Chile, Peru, and Bolivia  were hardest hit.&lt;ref&gt;Paulo Drinot and Alan Knight, '' The Great Depression in Latin America'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Thorp, ''Latin America in the 1930s: the role of the periphery in world crisis'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectuals and government leaders in Latin America turned their backs on the older economic policies and turned toward [[import substitution industrialization]]. The goal was to create self-sufficient economies, which would have their own industrial sectors and large middle classes and which would be immune to the ups and downs of the global economy. Despite the potential threats to United States commercial interests, the [[Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt administration]] (1933–1945) understood that the United States could not wholly oppose import substitution. Roosevelt implemented a [[Good Neighbor policy]] and did not block the nationalization of some American companies in Latin America. Mexican President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] nationalized American [[Petroleum industry|oil companies]], out of which he created [[Pemex]].&lt;ref&gt;Glen Barclay, ''Struggle for a Continent: The Diplomatic History of South America, 1917-1945'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Skidmore and Peter H. Smith, ''Modern Latin America'' (6th ed. 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
In Brazil, the largest country, a liberal revolution of 1930 overthrew the oligarchic coffee plantation owners and brought to power an urban middle class that and business interests that promoted industrialization and modernization.  Aggressive promotion of new industry turned around the economy by 1933, and encouraged American investors. support. Brazil's leaders in the 1920s and 1930s decided that Argentina's implicit foreign policy goal was to isolate Portuguese-speaking Brazil from Spanish-speaking neighbors, thus facilitating the expansion of Argentine economic and political influence in South America.  Even worse, was the fear that a more powerful Argentine Army would launch a surprise attack on the weaker Brazilian Army. To counter this threat, Brazil forged closer links with the United States.   Meanwhile, Argentina moved in the opposite direction. During World War II, Brazil was a staunch ally of the United States and sent its military to Europe. The United States provided over $100 million in [[Lend-Lease]] grants, in return for free rent on air bases used to transport American soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic, and naval bases for anti-submarine operations.  In sharp contrast, Argentina was officially neutral and at times favored Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley E. Hilton, "The Argentine Factor in Twentieth-Century Brazilian Foreign Policy Strategy." ''Political Science Quarterly'' 100.1 (1985): 27-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley E. Hilton, "Brazilian Diplomacy and the Washington-Rio de Janeiro 'Axis' during the World War II Era," ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' (1979) 59#2 pp. 201-231 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2514412 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Border disputes and warfare===
Small-scale border disputes were common,&lt;ref&gt;Including the [[Leticia Incident]] in 1932-33 and [[Ecuadorian–Peruvian War]] in 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; but only one spiralled out of control, leading to a major war: the [[Chaco War]] in 1932-35. Two small countries, Bolivia (with 2.2 million people)  and Paraguay (with only 900,000) fought grueling battles over control of the [[Gran Chaco]], a large but long-neglected border region where oil had recently been discovered. Bolivia, heavy oil, but needed a port on rivers controlled by Paraguay to export it.  Bolivia used authoritarian methods to raise a large, well-equipped army. However, its soldiers were accustomed to high altitudes and became sickly in the low-lying disease infested Chaco jungles.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Shesko, "Mobilizing Manpower for War: Toward a New History of Bolivia's Chaco Conflict, 1932–1935." ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 95.2 (2015): 299-334.&lt;/ref&gt;  Paraguay, employing émigré Russian officers, had much better planning and logistics, and was generally more successful militarily. About 28,000 soldiers and all were killed.  Paraguay was awarded about three fourths of the disputed territory in a peace treaty brokered by Argentina and four other South American nations.  Frustrated Bolivian veterans formed a political party, staged a coup and ruled for three years until they in turn were overthrown by the next coup&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Farcau, ''The Chaco War: Bolivia and Paraguay, 1932–1935'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia and Africa==
===Egypt===
{{main|Kingdom of Egypt}}
In December 1921, demonstrations again led to violence. In deference to the growing nationalism and at the suggestion of the [[High Commissioner]], [[Lord Allenby]], the UK [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|unilaterally declared]] Egyptian independence on 28 February 1922 Britain, however, continued in control of what was renamed the [[Kingdom of Egypt]]. British guided the king and retained control of the Canal Zone, [[Sudan]] and Egypt's external and military affairs. King Fuad died in 1936 and [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]] inherited the throne at the age of sixteen. Alarmed by the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] when Italy invaded Ethiopia, he signed the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]], requiring Britain to withdraw all troops from Egypt by 1949, except at the Suez Canal. During World War II, British troops [[Military history of Egypt during World War II|used Egypt]] as its primary base for all Allied operations throughout the region. British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in 1947, but nationalist, anti-British feelings continued to grow after the war.&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Vatikiotis, ''The History of Modern Egypt'' (4th ed., 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
{{Further|Foreign relations of Meiji Japan|Second Sino-Japanese War}}
In Japan, the Army increasingly took control of the government, assassinated opposing leaders, suppressed the left, and promoted a highly aggressive foreign policy with respect to China.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Dailey,  ''Move to Global War'' (2015) 205pp; [http://ushmaynardjackson.weebly.com/uploads/3/7/4/1/37417141/themove-to-globalwar_promo_pages.pdf pp 9-53 on Japan's expansion]&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese policy angered the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Hidemichi Akagi, ''Japan's Foreign Relations 1542-1936: A Short History'' (1979) pp, 481-550 [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.226231 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Japanese nationalism was the primary inspiration, coupled with a disdain for democracy.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Crowley, ''Japan's quest for autonomy: National security and foreign policy, 1930-1938'' (2015) ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme right became influential throughout the Japanese government and society, notably within the [[Kwantung Army]], which was stationed in Manchuria along the Japanese-owned [[South Manchuria Railroad]].  During the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, radical army officers conquered Manchuria from local officials and set up the puppet government of [[Manchukuo]] there without permission from the Japanese government. International criticism of Japan following the invasion led to Japan withdrawing from the League of Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Henshall, ''A History of Japan'' (2012) pp 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Duus et al. eds. ''The Japanese informal empire in China, 1895-1937'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Japanese Empire (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|right|300px|The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in 1942, after conquest of the colonies of the U.S., Britain and the Netherlands.]]
Japan's expansionist vision grew increasingly bold. Many of Japan's political elite aspired to have Japan acquire new territory for resource extraction and settlement of surplus population.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt; These ambitions led to the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937. After their victory in [[Battle of Nanking|the Chinese capital]], the Japanese military committed the infamous [[Nanking Massacre]]. The Japanese military failed to destroy the Chinese government led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]], which retreated to remote areas. The conflict was a stalemate that lasted until 1945.&lt;ref&gt;S. C. M. Paine, ''The Wars for Asia, 1911-1949'' (2012) pp 123-70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Japan's war aim was to establish the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]], a vast [[pan-Asian]] union under Japanese domination.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt; Hirohito's role in Japan's foreign wars remains a subject of controversy, with various historians portraying him as either a powerless figurehead or an enabler and supporter of Japanese militarism.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Weston, ''Giants of Japan: The Lives of Japan's Greatest Men and Women'' (2002) pp 201–203.&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States grew increasingly worried about the Philippines, an American colony, within easy range of Japan And started looking for ways to contain Japanese expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Kennedy, "Filling the Void?: Anglo-American Strategic Relations, Philippine Independence, and the Containment of Japan, 1932–1937." ''The International History Review'' (2017): 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

American public and elite opinion—including even the isolationists—strongly opposed Japan's invasion of China in 1937. President Roosevelt imposed increasingly stringent economic sanctions intended to deprive Japan of the oil and steel in needed to continue its war in China. Japan reacted by forging an alliance with Germany and Italy in 1940, known as the [[Tripartite Pact]], which worsened its relations with the US. In July 1941, the United States, Great Britain, and the Netherlands froze all Japanese assets and cut off oil shipments—Japan had little oil of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Totman, ''A History of Japan'' (2005). pp 554–556.&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{Main|History of the Republic of China}}
The Chinese revolution of 1911 that overthrew the last Emperor resulted in a decade of chaotic conditions, with power increasingly held by regional warlords. In the 1920s, [[Sun Yat-sen]] established a revolutionary base in south China, and set out to unite the fragmented nation. With assistance from the [[Soviet Union]] (itself fresh from a Lenin's takeover ), he entered into an alliance with the fledgling [[Communist Party of China]]. After Sun's death in 1925, his protégé, [[Chiang Kai-shek]], seized control of the ''[[Kuomintang]]'' (Nationalist Party or KMT) and brought most of south and central China under its rule in a military campaign known as the [[Northern Expedition]] (1926–1927). Having defeated the warlords in south and central China by military force, Chiang was able to secure the nominal allegiance of the warlords in the North. In 1927, Chiang turned on the CPC and relentlessly chased the CPC armies and its leaders from their bases in southern and eastern China. In 1934, driven from their mountain bases such as the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]], the CPC forces embarked on the [[Long March]] across China's most desolate terrain to the northwest, where they established a guerrilla base at [[Yan'an]] in Shaanxi Province. During the Long March, the communists reorganized under a new leader, [[Mao Zedong]] (Mao Tse-tung).&lt;ref&gt;Jay Taylor, ''The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the Struggle for Modern China'' (2011) pp 141-93&lt;/ref&gt;

Few Chinese had any illusions about Japanese desires on China. Hungry for raw materials and pressed by a growing population, Japan initiated the seizure of Manchuria in September 1931 and established ex-Qing emperor [[Puyi]] as head of the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932.  The [[League of Nations]] denounced Japan, and it quit the League.  The Japanese began to push from south of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] into northern China and the coastal provinces. In 1937, the Japanese army, acting largely independent of Tokyo, clashed with Chinese forces in the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] outside Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Crowley, "A Reconsideration of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident." ''Journal of Asian Studies'' 22.03 (1963): 277-291.&lt;/ref&gt;

A full-scale war began—the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_military_history/v070/70.1gordon.html David M. Gordon, "The China–Japan War, 1931–1945" ''Journal of Military History'' (2006) 70#1, pp. 137–82.] evaluates the major books.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan held enormous advantages in firepower, mobility and organizational strength. China had the sympathy of most of the world, especially the United States and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Ryoko Techika, "The basic structure of Chiang Kai-shek's diplomatic strategy." ''Journal of Modern Chinese History'' 7.1 (2013): 17-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Shanghai fell after a [[Battle of Shanghai|three-month battle]] and Japan took control virtually all the coastal cities. The capital of [[Nanjing]] fell in December 1937. It was followed by an orgy of mass murders and rapes known as the [[Nanjing Massacre]]. Chiang moved his national capital to remote  [[Chongqing]].  Japan set up a second puppet government, the [[Wang Jingwei regime]], based in Nanjing. The United States took the lead in expressing outrage, and began plans to systematically aid Chiang's regime by a long supply line through Indochina while demanding that Japan withdraw. Japan took control of Indochina from France in 1941, cutting the main supply line, and escalating the conflict toward a war with the United States and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Michael  Schaller, ''The US Crusade in China, 1938-1945'' (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradford A. Lee, ''Britain and the Sino-Japanese war, 1937-1939: a study in the dilemmas of British decline'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jerome Brown, Jr.,''' (October 20, 1987&amp;nbsp;– December 8, 2012) was an [[American football]] [[linebacker]] who played for five different teams combined in the [[National Football League]], [[Arena Football League]] and [[Canadian Football League]]. In college, he played on the [[defensive line]] for the [[University of Illinois]]. In his professional career, he was a member of the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] of the Canadian Football League, the [[Jacksonville Sharks]] and [[San Antonio Talons]] of the Arena Football League and the [[Indianapolis Colts]] and [[Dallas Cowboys]] of the National Football League. He was signed as a [[free agent]] by the Jacksonville Sharks in 2011 and was a contributor to the Sharks victory in [[ArenaBowl XXIV]] by having one tackle assist, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arenafan.com/statistics/?page=boxscore&amp;gameid=4936 |title=AFL Box Score: ArenaBowl XXIV - Jacksonville Sharks @ Arizona Rattlers (Aug 12, 2011) |publisher=arenafan.com |date=2011-08-12 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Brown played [[American football|football]] at [[Vashon High School]], helping his team win three St. Louis Public High League titles and three Missouri district championships. His best year came in 2005, recording 97 tackles, 13 sacks and one interception.

During his high school career, he was a two-time Public High League Defensive MVP and a first-team All-Public High League Conference selection. As a senior, he received PrepStar All-America honors, was named to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch first-team All-Metro squad and was a Missouri Sportswriters and Sportscasters Association Class 5 first-team all-state choice. He was the 11th-ranked high school recruit in Missouri and 53rd-ranked [[defensive end]] in the nation according to [[Rivals.com]].

==College career==
In 2006, Brown accepted a scholarship to the [[University of Illinois]]. He was redshirted as a freshman and by the end of the season he would go on to be named the team's defensive scout player of the year. He played in 13 games and had 2.5 sacks 
during [[University of Illinois|Illinois]]' run to the [[2008 Rose Bowl]].

In 2008, he saw action in 11 games, recording 3 tackles (1 for loss) against the [[University of Missouri]]. In 2009, he had an outstanding spring game making a game-high seven tackles and two sacks, but academic problems eventually forced him to leave school. During his college career, he played mostly as backup [[defensive end]], recording a total of 13 tackles (4 for loss), 2.5 sacks and two passes defensed.

==Professional career==

===Jacksonville Sharks (AFL)===
After not being selected in the [[2011 NFL Draft]], he signed with the [[Jacksonville Sharks]] of the [[Arena Football League]] (AFL) on March 3, [[2011 AFL season|2011]], helping the team win [[ArenaBowl XXIV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arenafan.com/teams/?page=transactions&amp;type=old&amp;team=139 | title=Historical Team Transactions | publisher=arenafan.com | accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final, he posted one tackle, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. In 13 regular season games he recorded 19.5 tackles, six sacks and three fumble recoveries.

===Hamilton Tiger-Cats (CFL)===
At the end of the [[Arena Football League|AFL]] season, he was signed to the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] practice roster on September 27, [[2011 CFL season|2011]].

===San Antonio Talons  (AFL)===
Brown signed with the [[San Antonio Talons]] of the [[Arena Football League|AFL]] on November 11, [[2011 AFL season|2011]]. He played in 11 games recording 34 tackles (5 for loss), two fumble recoveries and one blocked kick.

===Indianapolis Colts (NFL)===
He worked out for the [[Houston Texans]], [[New York Jets]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], before being signed as a [[free agent]] by the [[Indianapolis Colts]] on May 23, [[2012 NFL season|2012]] to play [[linebacker]]. He was one of the last cuts in preseason before making the team's practice squad. He appeared in one regular season game against the [[New York Jets]], before being waived and signed once again to the practice squad. He was cut from the team on October 20, [[2012 NFL season|2012]].

===Dallas Cowboys (NFL)===
On October 24, [[2012 NFL season|2012]], the [[Dallas Cowboys]] signed him to their practice squad, where he was making progress by being named scout team player of the week and receiving consideration for a move to the active roster, until losing his life in a car accident.

==Death==
On December 8, 2012, at 2:21&amp;nbsp;am, fellow Cowboys and Illinois teammate [[Josh Brent]] drove a car at high speeds with Brown in it. The car hit an outside curb on [[Texas State Highway 114]] outside Dallas, causing the vehicle to flip at least once and then come to rest in the middle of a service road. The car caught fire, which was extinguished.&lt;ref name="Yahoo! Sports"&gt;{{cite web|last=Biggs|first=Brad|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/josh-brent-tried-pull-jerry-011000067--nfl.html|title=Josh Brent tried to pull Jerry Brown from his burning Mercedes|publisher=[[Yahoo! Sports]]|date=2012-12-08|accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown was unresponsive at the scene and later pronounced dead. Brent was charged with [[driving under the influence]] and [[Manslaughter#Vehicular or intoxication manslaughter|intoxication manslaughter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cowboys/2012/12/08/josh-brent-arrest/1755831/ |title=Cowboys' Josh Brent arrested after crash kills teammate Jerry Brown |work=[[USA Today]] |author=Saraceno, Joe |author2=Garafalo, Mike |date=2012-12-08 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police stated that Brent attempted to pull Brown out of the car.&lt;ref name="Yahoo! Sports" /&gt;

This tragedy occurred one day before playing against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], which was a game with playoff implications for both sides and that the Bengals were heavily favored to win. Head coach [[Jason Garrett]] told the team of the incident and its tragic result on the plane, before flying to Cincinnati. That Saturday, the players held emotional meetings and hung the jerseys of Brent and Brown in their locker room.

The game would become one of the most emotional in franchise history. The defense was already going to play without 5 starters ([[Bruce Carter (American football)|Bruce Carter]], [[Sean Lee]], [[Barry Church]], [[Kenyon Coleman]] and [[Jay Ratliff]]) and they would also end up losing Brent, who was going  to start in place of Ratliff. The Cowboys stunned the Bengals with an improbable 20–19 come-from-behind victory that was decided in the closing seconds with a [[Dan Bailey (American football)|Dan Bailey]] 40-yard [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goal]]. After the final play, Garrett embraced [[Jason Hatcher]], who held Brown's jersey, which was originally placed on the bench during the game. In Brown's honor, the Cowboys wore a 53 decal on their uniforms, and kept his locker intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanzus|first=Dan|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000111257/article/cowboys-will-remember-jerry-brown-jr-with-53-decal|title=Cowboys will remember Jerry Brown Jr. with '53' decal|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-12-14|accessdate=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the memorial service, Stacey Jackson (Brown's mother) requested Brent to meet with the family at the airport, to also ride and sit with them while at the event. The team presented Jackson with the game ball of the 20–19 win over the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], along with a hard-hat award, which was given to players who did their job regardless of circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/2012/12/11/cowboys-hold-private-memorial-service-brown-brent-attends | title=Cowboys Hold Private Memorial Service For Brown; Brent Attends | accessdate=February 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Clinton years===
[[File:John Podesta official portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Podesta in 1993]]
Podesta served as both an Assistant to the President and as [[White House Deputy Chief of Staff|Deputy Chief of Staff]]. Earlier, from January 1993 to 1995, he was Assistant to the President, [[Staff Secretary]] and a senior policy adviser on government information, privacy, telecommunications security and regulatory policy.

Podesta encouraged [[Executive Order 12958]] which led to efforts to declassify millions of pages from the U.S. diplomatic and national security history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kean|first1=Leslie|title=John Podesta: Pulling Back the Curtain on UFOs|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leslie-kean/john-podesta-pulling-back_b_6717872.html|accessdate=December 10, 2015|publisher=Huffington Post|date=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Podesta founded the [[Center for American Progress]], a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[think tank]] in Washington, D.C., and served as its president and CEO until he stepped down in 2011. (CAP chief operating officer [[Neera Tanden]] succeeded Podesta as president and CEO, taking over day-to-day operations.)&lt;ref&gt;Janie Lorber, [http://www.rollcall.com/news/Center-for-American-Progress-Faces-Challenges-as-John-Podesta-Steps-Back-209775-1.html CAP Faces Challenges as Podesta Steps Back], ''Roll Call'', October 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RoginStepsDown"&gt;Josh Rogin, [https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/10/24/john-podesta-stepping-down-as-head-of-cap/ John Podesta stepping down as head of CAP], ''Foreign Policy'', October 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Podesta remained chairman of the nonexecutive board of directors for a time,&lt;ref name="RoginStepsDown"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RoginStepsDown"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Allen, [http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/john-podesta-white-house-center-for-american-progress-101103 W.H., CAP to counter Podesta attacks], Politico.com, December 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and remains on the board today, although not as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanprogress.org/about/c3-board/ CAP Board of Directors], Center for American Progress; accessed August 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2002–14, Podesta served as a member of the [[Constitution Project]]'s bipartisan Liberty and Security Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitutionproject.org/about-us/the-liberty-and-security-committee|title=The Liberty and Security Committee|publisher=Constitution Project|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he authored ''The Power of Progress: How America's Progressives Can (Once Again) Save Our Economy, Our Climate, and Our Country''. In 2009, he accompanied former President Bill Clinton to [[North Korea]] for negotiations securing the release of [[2009 imprisonment of American journalists by North Korea|two American journalists imprisoned]] on [[espionage]] charges. He can be seen in numerous widely circulated photographs of Clinton meeting with [[Kim Jong-il]].&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite web|title=Clinton in North Korea|url=http://www.latimes.com/la-0806-worldinphotos010_knv5wtncc-photo.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Podesta opposes the excessive use of [[Classified information|classification]], and in a 2004 speech at [[Princeton University]] condemned what he called the U.S.'s "excessive government secrecy" and "bloated secrecy bureaucracy".&lt;ref name="Podeta2004"&gt;[https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/general/news/2004/03/10/638/john-podesta-remarks-at-princeton-university John Podesta 2004 Remarks at Princeton University], Center for American Progress, March 10, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:President Barack Obama in a meeting aboard Air Force One en route to New Delhi.jpg|thumb|left|President Obama holds a meeting with John Podesta and [[Susan Rice]] aboard [[Air Force One]], 2015]]
Podesta has called [[Executive Order 12958]], "which set tough standards for classifying documents and led to the unprecedented effort to declassify millions of pages from our nation's diplomatic and national security history," as "perhaps the biggest accomplishment of the Clinton administration."&lt;ref name="Podeta2004"/&gt; More than 800 million pages of intelligence documents were declassified as part of the program.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Shipman|title=UFO enthusiasts call on Obama to release X-Files|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3536229/UFO-enthusiasts-call-on-Obama-to-release-X-Files.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London, UK|date=November 30, 2008|accessdate=December 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a 2002 news conference organized by [[Coalition for Freedom of Information]] Podesta stated that, "It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the real nature of this phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tony|last=Norman|title=Change is coming (but not for space aliens)|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08337/932038-153.stm|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=December 2, 2008|accessdate=December 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived in the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Belarusian]] city of [[Minsk]] until June 1962, when he returned to the United States with his Russian wife, [[Marina Oswald Porter|Marina]], and eventually settled in Dallas. Five government investigations&lt;ref group="n"&gt;These were investigations by: the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (1963), the [[Warren Commission]] (1964), the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (1979), the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], and the [[Dallas Police Department]].&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that Oswald shot and killed Kennedy from the sixth floor of the [[Texas School Book Depository]] as the President traveled by motorcade through [[Dealey Plaza]] in [[Dallas]], Texas.

About 45 minutes after Oswald assassinated Kennedy, he shot and killed Dallas police officer [[J. D. Tippit]] on a local street. Oswald then slipped into a movie theater, where he was arrested for Tippit's murder. Oswald was eventually charged with the murder of Kennedy; he denied the accusations and stated that he was a "[[Patsy#As a victim of deception|patsy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 366, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0193b.htm Kantor Exhibit No. 3—Handwritten notes made by Seth Kantor concerning events surrounding the assassination]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/jfk-assassination.html|title=A J.F.K.

In September 1964, the [[Warren Commission]] concluded that Oswald acted alone when he assassinated Kennedy by firing three shots from the Texas School Book Depository.

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Oswald was born in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, on October 18, 1939, to Robert Edward Lee Oswald, Sr. (1896–1939) and Marguerite Frances Claverie (1907–1981). Robert Oswald was a distant cousin of Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]] and served in the Marines during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.luckybeantours.com/notable-tomb-tuesday-robert-e-lee-oswald-father-of-lee-harvey-oswald/|title=Notable Tomb Tuesday – Robert E.

Through Marguerite's first marriage to Edward John Pic, Jr., Lee and Robert Jr. were the half-brothers of Air Force veteran John Edward Pic (1932–2000).&lt;ref name="WCR-A13"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Kennedy, Appendix 13|1964}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Marguerite moved the family from New Orleans to Dallas, Texas. Oswald entered the first grade in 1945 and over the next half-dozen years attended several different schools in the Dallas and [[Fort Worth]] areas through the sixth grade. Oswald took an [[IQ]] test in the fourth grade and scored 103; "on achievement tests in [grades 4 to 6], he twice did best in reading and twice did worst in spelling."{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Appendix 13|1964|pp=674–675}}

As a child, Oswald was described as withdrawn and temperamental by several people who knew him.&lt;ref name="WCR-C7"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Oswald and his mother were later asked to leave after an argument in which Oswald allegedly struck his mother and threatened John's wife with a pocket knife.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Oswald attended seventh grade in the Bronx, New York, but was often [[Truancy|truant]], which led to a psychiatric assessment at a juvenile reformatory.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Appendix 13|1964|p=677}} The reformatory psychiatrist, Dr. Renatus Hartogs, described Oswald as immersed in a "vivid fantasy life, turning around the topics of omnipotence and power, through which [Oswald] tries to compensate for his present shortcomings and frustrations." Dr. Hartogs detected a "personality pattern disturbance with [[Schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] features and [[Passive-aggressive behavior|passive-aggressive]] tendencies" and recommended continued treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acorn.net/jfkplace/03/JA/DR/.dr16.html |title=Report of Renatus Hartogs, May 1, 1953 |publisher=Acorn.net |date=May 1, 1953 |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1954, Marguerite returned to New Orleans and took Lee with her.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Appendix 13|1964|p=679}} At the time, there was a question pending before a New York judge as to whether Oswald should be removed from the care of his mother to finish his schooling,&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, [http://jfkassassination.net/russ/testimony/2_12_64_AM.htm Testimony of Mrs. Marguerite Oswald].&lt;/ref&gt;

Oswald completed the eighth and ninth grades in New Orleans.  He entered the 10th grade in 1955 but quit school after one month.&lt;ref name="Saturday"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bagdikian |first=Ben H. |authorlink=Ben Bagdikian |editor1-first=Clay |editor1-last=Blair Jr. |editor1-link=Clay Blair |date=December 14, 1963 |title=The Assassin |journal=The Saturday Evening Post |issue=44 |page=23 |publisher=The Curtis Publishing Company |location=Philadelphia, PA. 19105}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving school, Oswald worked for several months as an office clerk and messenger in New Orleans. In July 1956, Oswald's mother moved the family to Fort Worth, Texas, and Oswald re-enrolled in the 10th grade for the September session at [[Arlington Heights High School]] in Fort Worth. A few weeks later in October, Oswald quit school at age 17 to join the Marines (''see below'');{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Appendix 13|1964|p=681}} he never earned a high school diploma. By this point, he had resided at 22 locations and attended 12 schools.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;

Though Oswald had trouble spelling in his youth{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Appendix 13|1964|pp=674–675}} and may have had a "reading-spelling disability",{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 7|1964|p=383}} he read voraciously. By age 15, he considered himself a [[Marxist]] according to his diary: "I was looking for a key to my environment, and then I discovered [[socialism|socialist]] literature. I had to dig for my books in the back dusty shelves of libraries." At 16 he wrote to the [[Socialist Party of America]] for information on their [[Young People's Socialist League (1907)|Young People's Socialist League]], saying he had been studying socialist principles for "well over fifteen months."&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, CE 2240, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh25/html/WC_Vol25_0085b.htm FBI transcript of letter from Lee Oswald to the Socialist Party of America, October 3, 1956].&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Edward Voebel, "whom the Warren Commission had established was Oswald's closest friend during his teenage years in New Orleans..... said that reports that Oswald was already 'studying [[Communism]]' were a 'lot of [[Nonsense|baloney]].'

==Marine Corps==

Oswald enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]] on October 24, 1956, just after his seventeenth birthday.

Oswald's enlistment papers showed his vital statistics as {{convert|5|ft|8|in|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} in height, {{convert|135|lb}} in weight, with [[Eye color#Hazel|hazel eyes]] and [[brown hair]].&lt;ref name=bob/&gt; His primary training was in radar operation, which was a position that required a [[security clearance]].

At [[Keesler Air Force Base]] in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]], Oswald finished seventh in a class of thirty in the Aircraft Control and Warning Operator Course, which "included instruction in aircraft surveillance and the use of radar."{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Appendix 13|1964|pp=682–683}} He was given the [[military occupational specialty]] of Aviation Electronics Operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix-13.html#marines |title=Appendix 13 |publisher=Archives.gov |date= |accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, he reported to the [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro]] then departed for Japan the following month, where he was assigned to [[Marine Air Control Squadron 1]] at [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi]] near Tokyo.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Appendix 13|1964|p=683}}

Like all marines, Oswald was trained and tested in shooting. In December 1956, he scored 212, which was slightly above the requirements for the designation of [[Weapons Qualification Badge|''sharpshooter'']].&lt;ref name="Saturday"/&gt; In May 1959 he scored 191, which reduced his rating to [[Weapons Qualification Badge|''marksman'']].&lt;ref name="Saturday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WCR-C4"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Oswald was [[court-martialed]] after he [[Unintentional discharge (firearms)|accidentally shot]] himself in the elbow with an unauthorized [[.22 caliber]] handgun. He was court-martialed a second time for fighting with a sergeant who he thought was responsible for his punishment in the shooting matter. He was [[Reduction in rank|demoted]] from [[private first class]] to [[Private (rank)|private]] and briefly imprisoned in the [[Brig (prison)|brig]]. Oswald was later punished for a third incident: while he was on a night-time sentry duty in the [[Philippines]], he inexplicably fired his rifle into the [[jungle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Posner]] "Case Closed" Random House, New York, 1993 pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Slightly built, Oswald was nicknamed ''[[Ozzie Rabbit]]'' after the cartoon character; he was also called ''Oswaldskovich''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh8/pdf/WH8_Botelho_aff.pdf Affidavit of James Botelho]&lt;/ref&gt; because he espoused pro-[[Soviet]] sentiments.

While Oswald was in the Marines, he made an effort to teach himself rudimentary [[Russian language|Russian]]. Although this was an unusual endeavor, on February 25, 1959, he was invited to take a Marine proficiency exam in written and spoken Russian. His level at the time was rated "poor" in understanding spoken Russian, though he fared rather reasonably for a Marine private at the time in reading and writing.&lt;ref&gt;Summers 2013, pp. 140-141. The grades were -5 in understanding, +4 in reading and +3 in writing.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, 1959, he received a [[Military discharge|hardship discharge]] from active service, claiming his mother needed care. He was placed on the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]].&lt;ref name="Saturday"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 19, Folsom Exhibit No. 1, p. 85, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh19/html/WH_Vol19_0373b.htm Request for Dependency Discharge].

==Adult life and early crimes==

===Defection to the Soviet Union===
Oswald traveled to the [[Soviet Union]] just before he turned 20 in October 1959; he had planned the trip well in advance by teaching himself Russian and saving $1,500 of his Marine Corps salary.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 22, p. 705, CE 1385, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh22/html/WH_Vol22_0366a.htm Notes of interview of Lee Harvey Oswald conducted by Aline Mosby in Moscow in November 1959]. Oswald: "When I was working in the middle of the night on guard duty, I would think how long it would be and how much money I would have to save. It would be like being out of prison. I saved about $1500." During Oswald's 2 years and 10 months of service in the Marine Corps he received $3,452.20, after all taxes, allotments and other deductions as well as his GED. Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 26, p. 709, CE 3099, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/contents/wc/contents_wh26.htm Certified military pay records for Lee Harvey Oswald for the period October 24, 1956, to September 11, 1959].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Oswald spent two days with his mother in [[Fort Worth]], then embarked by ship on September 20 from New Orleans to [[Le Havre]], France, and immediately traveled to the United Kingdom. Arriving in [[Southampton]] on October 9, he told officials he had $700 and planned to stay for one week before proceeding to a school in Switzerland. However, on the same day, he flew to [[Helsinki]], where he was issued a Soviet [[Travel visa|visa]] on October 14. Oswald left Helsinki by train on the following day, crossed the Soviet border at [[Vainikkala]], and arrived in Moscow on October 16.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, [http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald/journey.htm The Journey From USA to USSR] at ''Russian Books''&lt;/ref&gt; His visa, valid only for a week, was due to expire on October 21.&lt;ref name=historicdiaryp94/&gt;

Almost immediately after arriving, Oswald informed his [[Intourist]] guide of his desire to become a Soviet citizen. When asked why by the various Soviet officials he encountered—all of whom, by Oswald's account, found his wish incomprehensible—he said that he was a [[communist]], and gave what he described in his diary as "vauge [''[[sic]]''] answers about 'Great Soviet Union'".&lt;ref name=historicdiaryp94&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 16, p. 94, CE 24, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh16/html/WH_Vol16_0059b.htm Lee Harvey Oswald's "Historic Diary"], entries of October 16, 1959 to October 21, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 21, the day his visa was due to expire, he was told that his [[citizenship]] application had been refused, and that he had to leave the Soviet Union that evening. Distraught, Oswald inflicted a minor but bloody wound to his left wrist in his hotel room bathtub soon before his Intourist guide was due to arrive to escort him from the country, according to his diary because he wished to kill himself in a way that would shock her.&lt;ref name=historicdiaryp94/&gt; Delaying Oswald's departure because of his self-inflicted injury, the Soviets kept him in a Moscow hospital under psychiatric observation until October 28, 1959.&lt;ref name=historicdiaryp95&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 16, p. 95, CE 24, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh16/html/WH_Vol16_0060a.htm Lee Harvey Oswald's "Historic Diary"], entries of October 21, 1959 to October 28, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Oswald, he met with four more Soviet officials that same day, who asked if he wanted to return to the United States. Oswald replied by insisting that he wanted to live in the Soviet Union as a Soviet national. When pressed for identification papers, he provided his Marine Corps discharge papers.&lt;ref name=historicdiaryp97&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 16, p. 96, CE 24, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh16/html/WH_Vol16_0060b.htm Lee Harvey Oswald's "Historic Diary"], entries of October 28, 1959 to October 31, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, Oswald appeared at the [[United States embassy in Moscow]] and declared a desire to renounce his U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, [http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald/moscow1.htm Moscow Part 1] at ''Russian Books''

&lt;/ref&gt; "I have made up my mind," he said; "I'm through."&lt;ref name=miaminews1959/&gt; He told the U.S. embassy interviewing officer, [[Richard Edward Snyder]], that "he had been a radar operator in the Marine Corps and that he had voluntarily stated to unnamed Soviet officials that as a Soviet citizen he would make known to them such information concerning the Marine Corps and his specialty as he possessed.

Though Oswald had wanted to attend [[Moscow State University]], he was sent to [[Minsk]] to work as a lathe operator at the Gorizont Electronics Factory, which produced radios, televisions, and military and space electronics. [[Stanislau Shushkevich]], who later became independent [[Belarus]]'s first head of state, was also engaged by Gorizont at the time, and was assigned to teach Oswald Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nv-online.info/by/251/printed/41936/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2-%D0%A8%D0%A3%D0%A8%D0%9A%D0%95%D0%92%D0%98%D0%A7-%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE.htm |title=Stanislau Shushkevich, biographical sketch (in Russian) |publisher=Nv-online.info |date= |accessdate=March 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316050840/http://www.nv-online.info/by/251/printed/41936/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2-%D0%A8%D0%A3%D0%A8%D0%9A%D0%95%D0%92%D0%98%D0%A7-%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE.htm |archive-date=March 16, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oswald received a government-subsidized, fully furnished studio apartment in a prestigious building and an additional supplement to his factory pay, which allowed him to have a comfortable standard of living by working-class Soviet standards,&lt;ref&gt;Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, [http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald/minsk3.htm Minsk Part 3] at ''Russian Books''&lt;/ref&gt; though he was kept under constant [[surveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, [http://www.russianbooks.org/oswald/minsk2.htm Minsk Part 2] at ''Russian Books''&lt;/ref&gt;

From approximately June 1960 to February 1961, Oswald was in a personal relationship with [[Ella German]], a co-worker at the factory.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Oswald wrote in his [[diary]] in January 1961: "I am starting to reconsider my desire about staying. The work is drab, the money I get has nowhere to be spent. No nightclubs or bowling alleys, no places of recreation except the trade union dances. I have had enough."{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 7|1964|p=394}} Shortly afterwards, Oswald (who had never formally renounced his U.S. citizenship) wrote to the [[Embassy of the United States, Moscow]] requesting return of his American passport, and proposing to return to the U.S. if any charges against him would be dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 18, p. 131, CE 931, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh18/html/WH_Vol18_0073a.htm Undated letter from Lee Harvey Oswald to the American Embassy in Moscow].&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1961, Oswald met [[Marina Oswald Porter|Marina Prusakova]] (b. 1941), a 19-year-old pharmacology student; they married less than six weeks later in April.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Though later reports described her uncle, with whom she was living, as a colonel in the [[KGB]], he was a lumber industry expert in the [[Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD) with a bureaucratic rank of ''Polkovnik''.

The Oswalds' first child, June, was born on February 15, 1962. On May 24, 1962, Oswald and Marina applied at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for documents that enabled her to immigrate to the U.S. On June 1, the U.S. Embassy gave Oswald a repatriation loan of $435.71.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Oswald, Marina, and their infant daughter left for the United States, where they received less attention from the press than Oswald expected, much to his disappointment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1962/06/09/page/101/article/marine-learns-that-the-u-s-a-dwarfs-russia "Marine Learns That the U.S.A.

===Dallas–Fort Worth===
The Oswalds soon settled in the [[Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex|Dallas/Fort Worth]] area, where Lee's mother and brother lived. Lee began a manuscript on Soviet life, though he eventually gave up the project.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

In July 1962, Oswald was hired by the Leslie Welding Company in Dallas; he disliked the work and quit after three months. On October 12, he started working for the graphic-arts firm of Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall as a photoprint trainee.

[[File:Oswaldrifle.jpg|thumb|right|Lee Harvey Oswald's $29.95 secondhand Carcano rifle, in the US National Archives]]
In March 1963, Oswald used the alias "A. Hidell" to make a mail-order purchase of a secondhand [[6.5×52mm Mannlicher–Carcano|6.5&amp;nbsp;mm caliber]] [[Carcano]] rifle for $29.95.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

He fired the Carcano rifle at Walker through a window from less than {{convert|100|ft|m}} away as Walker sat at a desk in his Dallas home. The bullet struck the window-frame and Walker's only injuries were bullet fragments to the forearm.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964|pp=184–195}} The [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]] stated that the "evidence strongly suggested" that Oswald carried out the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0046a.htm Findings of the Select Committee on Assassinations], HSCA Final Report, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

General Walker was an outspoken anti-communist, [[segregationist]], and member of the [[John Birch Society]]. In 1961, Walker had been relieved of his command of the 24th Division of the U.S. Army in [[West Germany]] for distributing [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] literature to his troops.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Peter Dale.

He was temporarily held in a [[mental institution]] on orders from President Kennedy's brother, Attorney General [[Robert Kennedy]], but a [[grand jury]] refused to [[indict]] him.&lt;ref&gt;Summers 1998, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marina Oswald testified that her husband told her that he traveled by bus to General Walker's house and shot at Walker with his rifle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh1/html/WC_Vol1_0015a.htm Testimony of Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald], Warren Commission Hearings, volume 1, pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

:Mr. WOLF. In your professional opinion, Dr. Guinn, is the fragment removed from General Walker's house a fragment from a WCC ([[Western Cartridge Company]]) Mannlicher–Carcano bullet?
:Dr. GUINN. I would say that it is extremely likely that it is, because there are very few, very few other ammunitions that would be in this range. I don't know of any that are specifically this close as these numbers indicate, but somewhere near them there are a few others, but essentially this is in the range that is rather characteristic of WCC Mannlicher–Carcano bullet lead.&lt;/ref&gt;

The de Mohrenschildts testified that on April 14, 1963, just before Easter Sunday, they were visiting the Oswalds at their new apartment and had brought them a toy Easter bunny to give to their child. As Oswald's wife Marina was showing Jeanne around the apartment, they discovered Oswald's rifle standing upright, leaning against the wall inside a closet. Jeanne told George that Oswald had a rifle, and George joked to Oswald, "Were you the one who took a pot-shot at General Walker?"

On May 26, Oswald wrote to the [[New York City]] headquarters of the pro-Castro [[Fair Play for Cuba Committee]], proposing to rent "a small office at my own expense for the purpose of forming a FPCC branch here in New Orleans."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0266b.htm Lee (Vincent T.), Exhibit No. 2], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, the FPCC responded to Oswald's letter advising against opening a New Orleans office "at least not ... at the very beginning."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0268a.htm Lee (Vincent T.), Exhibit No. 3], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow-up letter, Oswald replied, "Against your advice, I have decided to take an office from the very beginning."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0269b.htm Lee (Vincent T.), Exhibit No. 4], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 518.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, Oswald ordered the following items from a local printer: 500 application forms, 300 membership cards, and 1,000 leaflets with the heading, "Hands Off Cuba".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh25/html/WC_Vol25_0402a.htm FBI Report of Investigation of Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities for Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New Orleans], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 25, pp. 770, 773.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lee Oswald's wife Marina, Lee told her to sign the name "A.J.

According to anti-Castro militant [[Carlos Bringuier]], Oswald visited him on August 5 and 6 at a store he owned in New Orleans. Bringuier was the New Orleans delegate for the anti-Castro organization [[Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil]] (DRE). Bringuier would later tell the Warren Commission that he believed Oswald's visits were an attempt by Oswald to infiltrate his group.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 10, pp. 34–37, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh10/html/WC_Vol10_0021b.htm Testimony of Carlos Bringuier].&lt;/ref&gt; On August 9, Oswald turned up in downtown New Orleans handing out pro-Castro leaflets. Bringuier confronted Oswald, claiming he was tipped off about Oswald's leafleting by a friend. A scuffle ensued and Oswald, Bringuier, and two of Bringuier's friends were arrested for disturbing the peace.&lt;ref&gt;Summers 1998, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh17/pdf/wh17_ce_826.pdf Federal Bureau of Investigation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031023104538/http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh17/pdf/WH17_CE_826.pdf |date=October 23, 2003 }}, August 15, 1963, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 17, pp. 758–764, Commission Exhibit 826&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to leaving the police station, Oswald requested to speak with an FBI agent.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Marina's friend Ruth Paine transported Marina and her child by car from New Orleans to the Paine home in [[Irving, Texas]], near Dallas, on September 23, 1963.&lt;ref name="aarclibrary.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, pp. 7–9, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0008a.htm Testimony of Ruth Hyde Paine Resumed].&lt;/ref&gt; Oswald stayed in New Orleans at least two more days to collect a $33 unemployment check. It is uncertain when he left New Orleans; he is next known to have boarded a bus in [[Houston]] on September 26—bound for the Mexican border, rather than Dallas—and to have told other bus passengers that he planned to travel to [[Cuba]] via [[Mexico]].{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Appendix 13|1964|p=732}}&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 11, pp. 214–215, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh11/html/WC_Vol11_0112b.htm Affidavit of John Bryan McFarland and Meryl McFarland].&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in [[Mexico City]] on September 27, where he applied for a transit visa at the Cuban Embassy,&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 25, p. 418, CE 2564, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh25/html/WC_Vol25_0422b.htm Cuban visa application of Lee Harvey Oswald, September 27, 1963].&lt;/ref&gt; claiming he wanted to visit Cuba on his way to the Soviet Union. The Cuban embassy officials insisted Oswald would need Soviet approval, but he was unable to get prompt co-operation from the Soviet embassy.

After five days of shuttling between consulates&lt;!-- above says couldn't get co-op from *Embassy*, but now says *consulate* --- which is it? --&gt;—and including a heated argument with an official at the Cuban consulate, impassioned pleas to KGB agents, and at least some CIA scrutiny&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcmemos/Oswald_Foreign_Activities/html/180-10096-10364_0094a.htm (undated) Oswald's Foreign Activities (Coleman and Slawson to Rankin)] (page 94) at ''The Assassination Archives and Research Center''&lt;/ref&gt;—Oswald was told by a Cuban consular officer that he was disinclined to approve the visa, saying "a person like [Oswald] in place of aiding the Cuban Revolution, was doing it harm."{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 7|1964|p=413}} Later, on October 18, the Cuban embassy approved the visa, but by this time Oswald was back in the United States and had given up on his plans to visit Cuba and the Soviet Union. Still later, eleven days before the assassination of President Kennedy, Oswald wrote to the Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C., saying, "Had I been able to reach the Soviet Embassy in [[Havana]], as planned, the embassy there would have had time to complete our business."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/forum/ Oswald: Myth, Mystery, and Meaning], [[Frontline (TV series)|FRONTLINE]], November 20, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 8, p. 358, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol8/html/HSCA_Vol8_0181b.htm Letter from Lee Oswald to Embassy of the U.S.S.R., Washington, D.C., November 9, 1963].

(page 19) at ''The Assassination Archives and Research Center''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald had visited Mexico City and the Cuban and Soviet consulates, questions regarding whether someone posing as Oswald had appeared at the embassies were serious enough to be investigated by the House Select Committee on Assassinations. Later, the Committee agreed with the Warren Commission that Oswald had visited Mexico City and concluded that "the majority of evidence tends to indicate" that Oswald in fact visited the consulates, but the Committee could not rule out the possibility that someone else had used his name in visiting the consulates.&lt;ref&gt;House Select Committee on Assassinations, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/lopezrpt/html/LopezRpt_0018a.htm 1996 Release: Oswald, the CIA, and Mexico City ("Lopez Report")], p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Dallas===
[[File:SchoolbookDepository.jpg|thumb|right|[[Texas School Book Depository]], the building where Oswald worked as a shipping clerk when he fired the fatal shots that killed Kennedy]]
On October 2, 1963, Oswald left Mexico City by bus and arrived in Dallas the next day. Ruth Paine said that her neighbor told her, on October 14, that there was a job opening at the [[Texas School Book Depository]], where her neighbor's brother, Wesley Frazier, worked. Mrs. Paine informed Oswald, who was interviewed at the depository and was hired there on October 16 as a $1.25 an hour minimum wage order filler.&lt;ref name="WCR-C1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Oswald did not drive a car, but he commuted to and from Dallas on Mondays and Fridays with his co-worker Wesley Frazier. On October 20 (a month before the assassination), the Oswalds' second daughter, Audrey, was born.

FBI agents twice visited the Paine home in early November, when Oswald was not present, and spoke to Mrs. Paine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix-13.html Warren Commission Report, p. 739].&lt;/ref&gt; Oswald visited the Dallas FBI office about 2 to 3 weeks before the assassination, asking to see Special Agent [[James P. Hosty]]. When he was told that Hosty was unavailable, Oswald left a note that, according to the receptionist, read: "Let this be a warning. I will blow up the FBI and the Dallas Police Department if you don't stop bothering my wife" [signed] "Lee Harvey Oswald." The note allegedly contained some sort of threat, but accounts vary as to whether Oswald threatened to "blow up the FBI" or merely "report this to higher authorities". According to Hosty, the note said, "If you have anything you want to learn about me, come talk to me directly. If you don't cease bothering my wife, I will take the appropriate action and report this to the proper authorities." Agent Hosty said that he destroyed Oswald's note on orders from his superior, Gordon Shanklin, after Oswald was named the suspect in the Kennedy assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0113a.htm HSCA Final Assassinations Report], House Select Committee on Assassinations, pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summers 1998, pp. 283–286.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Kennedy's motorcade passed through Dealey Plaza at about 12:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on November 22, Oswald fired three rifle shots from the sixth-floor window of the book depository,&lt;ref name="WCR-C3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

According to the investigations, Oswald hid and covered the rifle with boxes after the attack and descended through the rear stairwell. About 90 seconds after the shots rang out, Oswald encountered police officer Marrion L. Baker, who had his gun drawn,  in the second-floor lunchroom. The patrolman was accompanied by Oswald's supervisor, Roy Truly. Baker made the mistake of letting Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee; Baker and Truly incorrectly assumed that Oswald was not a suspect because he was an employee of the building.

At about 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m., Oswald boarded a city bus. Probably due to heavy traffic, he requested a transfer from the driver and got off two blocks later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfkassassination.net/transfer.gif Bus transfer (.gif)] at ''Kennedy Assassination Home Page''&lt;/ref&gt; Oswald took a taxicab to his rooming house at 1026 North Beckley Avenue and entered through the front door at about 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. According to his housekeeper Earlene Roberts, Oswald immediately went to his room, "walking pretty fast."&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 6, pp. 438–439, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh6/html/WC_Vol6_0225a.htm Testimony of Earlene Roberts].&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts said that Oswald left "a very few minutes" later, zipping up a jacket he was not wearing when he had entered earlier. As Oswald left, Roberts looked out of the window of her house and last saw him standing at the northbound Beckley Avenue bus stop in front of her house.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 7, p. 439, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh7/html/WC_Vol7_0224a.htm Affidavit of Earlene Roberts].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summers 1998, p. 66. {{ISBN|1-56924-739-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Warren Commission concluded that at approximately 1:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., Dallas Patrolman [[J. D. Tippit]] drove up in his patrol car alongside Oswald—presumably because Oswald resembled the police broadcast description of the man seen by witness Howard Brennan who fired shots at the presidential motorcade. He encountered Oswald near the corner of East 10th Street and North Patton Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;Oswald was {{convert|5|ft|9|in|m}} tall and weighed {{convert|150|lb|kg}}.

===Arrest at the Texas Theatre===
[[File:GeraldHill-B.jpg|thumb|Oswald being led from the [[Texas Theatre]] following his arrest for the killing of Officer J.D. Tippit]]
Shoe store manager Johnny Brewer testified that he saw Oswald "ducking into" the entrance alcove of his store. Suspicious of this activity, Brewer watched Oswald continue up the street and slip without paying into the nearby [[Texas Theatre]], where ''[[Cry of Battle]]'' was playing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh7/html/WC_Vol7_0006a.htm Testimony of Johnny Calvin Brewer], 7 H 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; He alerted the theater's ticket clerk, who telephoned police&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh7/html/WC_Vol7_0010a.htm Testimony of Julia Postal], 7 H 11.&lt;/ref&gt; at about 1:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.

As police arrived, the [[house lights#house lights and worklights|house lights]] were brought up and Brewer pointed out Oswald sitting near the rear of the theater. Police Officer Nick McDonald testified that he was the first to reach Oswald and that Oswald seemed ready to surrender saying, "Well, it is all over now." McDonald said that Oswald pulled out a pistol tucked into the front of his pants, then pointed the pistol at him, and pulled the trigger. McDonald stated that the pistol did not fire because the pistol's hammer came down on the webbing between the thumb and index finger of his hand as he grabbed for the pistol. McDonald also said that Oswald struck him, but that he struck back and Oswald was disarmed.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, [http://www.jfk-assassination.com/warren/wch/vol3/page295.php Testimony of M. N. McDonald].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|mv5vemBcjok}}. Brewer and McDonald testify on film to a reporter at the sites of the shoe store and inside the Texas Theater.&lt;/ref&gt; As he was led from the theater, Oswald shouted he was a victim of [[Police brutality in the United States|police brutality]].&lt;ref name=arrest-by-mcdonald&gt;[http://www.jfk-online.com/mcdonald.html "Oswald and Officer McDonald:The Arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald"]. Retrieved June 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 2 p.m., Oswald was taken to the Police Department building, where homicide detective [[Jim Leavelle]] questioned him about the shooting of Officer Tippit. When Captain J. W. Fritz heard Oswald's name, he recognized it as that of the book depository employee who was reported missing and was already a suspect in the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh21/html/WH_Vol21_0268b.htm Copy of an undated statement made by Richard M.

&lt;!--timeline is confusing. Above, Fritz recognizes Oswald's name, and "Oswald was booked for both murders, and by end of night arraigned". But now we we jump to hallway with reporters and LHO as been "advised of charge" re Tippit, but "not yet arraigned" for K. This is very hard to follow. Can someone straighten this out? --&gt;
Soon after his arrest, Oswald encountered reporters in a hallway. Oswald declared, "I didn't shoot anybody" and, "They've taken me in because of the fact that I lived in the Soviet Union. I'm just a patsy!"&lt;ref name="Bugliosi2007b"&gt;Bugliosi, ''Reclaiming History'', pp. 841–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, at an arranged press meeting, a reporter asked, "Did you kill the President?" and Oswald—who by that time had been advised of the charge of murdering Tippit, but had not yet been arraigned in Kennedy's death—&lt;!--advised, booked, arraigned – can someone clear all this up? --&gt;answered, "No, I have not been charged with that. In fact, nobody has said that to me yet. The first thing I heard about it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question." As he was led from the room the question was called out, "What did you do in Russia?" and, "How did you hurt your eye?"; Oswald answered, "A policeman hit me."&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 366, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0193b.htm Kantor Exhibit No. 3 – Handwritten notes made by Seth Kantor concerning events surrounding the assassination].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/oswald/|title=Oswald's Ghost {{!}} American Experience {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|language=en|access-date=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oswald was interrogated several times during his two days at Dallas Police Headquarters. He admitted that he went to his rooming house after leaving the book depository. He also admitted that he changed his clothes and armed himself with a .38 revolver before leaving his house to go to the theater.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, Anthony. ''Not in Your Lifetime'', (New York: Marlowe &amp; Company, 1998), p. 66. {{ISBN|1-56924-739-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Oswald denied killing Kennedy and Tippit, denied owning a rifle, and said two photographs of him holding a rifle and a pistol were fakes. He denied telling his co-worker he wanted a ride to Irving to get curtain rods for his apartment (he said that the package contained his lunch). He also denied carrying a long, bulky package to work the morning of the assassination. Oswald denied knowing an "A. J. Hidell". Oswald was then shown a forged [[Selective Service System]] card bearing his photograph and the alias, "Alek James Hidell" that he had in his possession at the time of his arrest. Oswald refused to answer any questions concerning the card, saying "you have the card yourself and you know as much about it as I do."{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

FBI Special Agent [[James P. Hosty]] and Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz (chief of homicide) conducted the first interrogation of Oswald on Friday, November 22. When Oswald was asked to account for himself at the time of the assassination, he replied that he was eating his lunch in the first-floor lounge (known as the "domino room"). He said that he then went to the second-floor lunchroom to buy a Coca-Cola from the soda machine there and was drinking it when he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker, who had entered the building with his gun drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 4, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh4/html/WC_Vol4_0238a.htm Testimony of James P.

Ruby later said he had been distraught over Kennedy's death and that his motive for killing Oswald was "saving Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial."&lt;ref name="history-matters.com"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh5/html/WC_Vol5_0104b.htm Testimony of Jack Ruby], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 5, pp. 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have hypothesized that Ruby was part of a conspiracy. [[G. Robert Blakey]], chief counsel 
for the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] from 1977 to 1979, said: "The most plausible explanation for the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby was that Ruby had stalked him on behalf of organized crime, trying to reach him on at least three occasions in the forty-eight hours before he silenced him forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0MeH1Z-Dd-QC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;q=stalked |last=Goldfarb |first=Ronald |title=Perfect Villains, Imperfect Heroes: Robert F.

[[File:Grave of Lee Harvey Oswald.jpg|thumb|Oswald's replacement gravestone]]
Oswald's body was buried on November 25 in [[Rose Hill Cemetery (Fort Worth, Texas)|Shannon Rose Hill Memorial Burial Park]] in Fort Worth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jfkassassination.net/parnell/grave.htm Directions to Lee Harvey Oswald's Grave] at ''Kennedy Assassination Home Page''&lt;/ref&gt; Reporters covering the burial were asked by officials to act as pallbearers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/world/57162874-68/oswald-fort-lee-worth.html.csp Lee Harvey Oswald pallbearer recalls the weather and widow] ''The Salt Lake Tribune'', November 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The original tombstone, which gave Oswald's full name as well as birth and death dates, was stolen; officials replaced it with a marker simply inscribed ''Oswald''.

==Official investigations==

===Warren Commission===
President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] issued an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] that created the [[Warren Commission]] to investigate the assassination. The commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy, and the Warren Report could not ascribe any one motive or group of motives to Oswald's actions:

{{quote|It is apparent, however, that Oswald was moved by an overriding hostility to his environment. He does not appear to have been able to establish meaningful relationships with other people. He was perpetually discontented with the world around him. Long before the assassination he expressed his hatred for American society and acted in protest against it. Oswald's search for what he conceived to be the perfect society was doomed from the start. He sought for himself a place in history—a role as the "great man" who would be recognized as having been in advance of his times. His commitment to Marxism and communism appears to have been another important factor in his motivation. He also had demonstrated a capacity to act decisively and without regard to the consequences when such action would further his aims of the moment. Out of these and the many other factors which may have molded the character of Lee Harvey Oswald there emerged a man capable of assassinating President Kennedy.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 7|1964|pp=423–424}}}}

The proceedings of the commission were closed, though not secret. Approximately 3% of its files have yet to be released to the public, which has continued to provoke speculation among researchers.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;"Two misconceptions about the Warren Commission hearing need to be clarified...hearings were closed to the public unless the witness appearing before the Commission requested an open hearing. No witness except one...requested an open hearing...Second, although the hearings (except one) were conducted in private, they were not secret. In a secret hearing, the witness is instructed not to disclose his testimony to any third party, and the hearing testimony is not published for public consumption. The witnesses who appeared before the Commission were free to repeat what they said to anyone they pleased, and ''all'' of their testimony was subsequently published in the first fifteen volumes put out by the Warren Commission." (Bugliosi, p. 332)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramsey Clark Panel===
In 1968, the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Ramsey Clark Panel]] examined various photographs, X-ray films, documents, and other evidence. It concluded that Kennedy was struck by two bullets fired from above and behind him: one of which traversed the base of the neck on the right side without striking bone, and the other of which entered the skull from behind and destroyed its right side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/clark.txt 1968 Panel Review of Photographs, X-Ray Films, Documents and Other Evidence Pertaining to the Fatal Wounding of President John E Kennedy on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QivShfp7?url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/clark.txt |date=July 30, 2007 }} (.txt) at ''Kennedy Assassination Home Page''&lt;/ref&gt;

===House Select Committee===
{{Main|United States House Select Committee on Assassinations}}
{{Further|Dictabelt evidence relating to the assassination of John F. Kennedy}}

In 1979, after a review of the evidence and of prior investigations, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) largely concurred with the Warren Commission and was preparing to issue a finding that Oswald had acted alone in killing Kennedy.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi, p. 376"&gt;Bugliosi, ''Reclaiming History'', p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; However, late in the Committee's proceedings a [[dictabelt]] recording was introduced, purportedly recording sounds heard in Dealey Plaza before, during and after the shots. After an analysis by the firm [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman]] appeared to indicate more than three gunshots, the HSCA revised its findings to assert a "high probability that two gunmen fired" at Kennedy and that Kennedy "was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy." Although the Committee was "unable to identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy," it made a number of further findings regarding the likelihood or unlikelihood that particular groups, named in the findings, were involved.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0005a.htm Findings of the Select Committee on Assassinations] HSCA Final Report, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the twelve members of the HSCA dissented from this conclusion.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi, p. 376"/&gt;

The acoustical evidence has since been discredited.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi, p. 377"&gt;{{cite book|first=Vincent|last=Bugliosi|authorlink=Vincent Bugliosi|title=Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F.

McLain was, as stated, not yet in D.P. at the time of the shots, why would he be part of the "we" who "immediately took off" for the hospital? Inquiring minds want to know!--&gt;

In 1982, a panel of twelve scientists appointed by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], including Nobel laureates [[Norman Ramsey]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], unanimously concluded that the acoustic evidence submitted to the HSCA was "seriously flawed", was recorded after the shots, and did not indicate additional gunshots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10264 |title=Report of the Committee on Ballistic Acoustics |publisher=Nap.edu |date= |accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their conclusions were published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Reexamination of Acoustic Evidence in the Kennedy Assassination | author=Committee on Ballistic Acoustics, National Research Council | journal=Science |date=October 1982 | volume=218 | issue=8 | pages=127–133 | doi=10.1126/science.6750789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 article in the journal ''[[Science &amp; Justice]]'', D.B. Thomas wrote that the NAS investigation was itself flawed. He concluded with a 96.3 percent certainty that there were at least two gunmen firing at President Kennedy and that at least one shot came from the grassy knoll.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B.

Retrieved April 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Thomas's conclusions were rebutted in the same journal. Ralph Linsker and several members of the original NAS team reanalyzed the timings of the recordings and reaffirmed the earlier conclusion of the NAS report that the alleged shot sounds were recorded approximately one minute after the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Linsker R., Garwin R.L., Chernoff H., Horowitz P., Ramsey N.F., [http://jfk-records.com/ScienceAndJustice_45%284%29_207-226%282005%29.pdf "Synchronization of the acoustic evidence in the assassination of President Kennedy"]. ''Science &amp; Justice'', vol. 45(4), 2005, pp. 207–226.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, D.B.

These photos were labelled CE 133-A and CE 133-B. CE 133-A shows the rifle in Oswald's left hand and newspapers in front of his chest in the other, while the rifle is held with the right hand in CE 133-B. The Carcano in the images had markings matching those on the rifle found in the Book Depository after the assassination. Oswald's mother testified that on the day after the assassination she and Marina destroyed another photograph with Oswald holding the rifle with both hands over his head, with "To my daughter June" written on it.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 1, p. 146, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh1/html/WC_Vol1_0079b.htm Testimony of Mrs. Marguerite Oswald].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[HSCA]] obtained another first-generation print (from CE 133-A) on April 1, 1977, from the widow of [[George de Mohrenschildt]]. The words "Hunter of fascists—ha ha ha!" written in block Russian were on the back. Also in English were added in script: "To my friend George, Lee Oswald, 5/IV/63 [April 5, 1963]."&lt;ref&gt;HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 6, p. 151, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol6/html/HSCA_Vol6_0079a.htm Figure IV-21].&lt;/ref&gt; Handwriting experts for the HSCA concluded the English inscription and signature were by Oswald. After two original photos, one negative and one first-generation copy had been found, the Senate Intelligence Committee located (in 1976) a third backyard photo (CE 133-C) showing Oswald with newspapers held away from his body in his right hand.

These photos, widely recognized as some of the most significant evidence against Oswald, have been subjected to rigorous analysis.&lt;ref&gt;HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 6, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol6/html/HSCA_Vol6_0072b.htm "The Oswald Backyard Photographs"]&lt;/ref&gt; Photographic experts consulted by the HSCA concluded they were genuine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/photos.txt |title=Photos |date= |accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; answering twenty-one points raised by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/photos.txt |title=United States House Select Committee on Assassinations Report Chapter VI |date= |accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marina Oswald has always maintained she took the photos herself, and the 1963 de Mohrenschildt print bearing Oswald's signature clearly indicate they existed before the assassination.

==Other investigations and dissenting theories==
{{Main|John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories}} &lt;!-- if this section remains "other investigations and dissenting theories", isn't there a slight overspecialization in this link – in other words, are all dissenting theories "conspiracy" theories? And didn't HSCA endorse "dissenting theories"? So shouldn't it be here instead of under "official"? But it was official, wasn't it, so therefore it belongs in the other section?--&gt;

Some critics have not accepted the conclusions of the Warren Commission and have proposed several other theories, such as that Oswald conspired with others, or was not involved at all and was [[frameup|framed]].&lt;!--a good summary of dissenting theories is needed here, though note there is a separate article ("see also") to carry most of that load --&gt; A [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] Poll taken in mid-November 2013, showed 61% believed that Kennedy was killed as a result of conspiracy, and only 30% thought Oswald acted alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/165893/majority-believe-jfk-killed-conspiracy.aspx |title=Majority in U.S. Still Believe JFK Killed in a Conspiracy: Mafia, federal government top list of potential conspirators |publisher=Gallup, Inc. |date=November 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801184321/http://www.gallup.com/poll/165893/majority-believe-jfk-killed-conspiracy.aspx |archivedate=August 1, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oswald was never prosecuted because he was murdered two days after the assassination. In March 1967, [[New Orleans]] [[District Attorney]] [[Jim Garrison]] arrested and charged New Orleans businessman [[Clay Shaw]] with conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy, with the help of Oswald, [[David Ferrie]], and others. Garrison believed that the men were part of an arms smuggling ring supplying weapons to the anti-Castro Cubans in a conspiracy with elements of the CIA to kill Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Jim Garrison| title = On the Trail of the Assassins: My Investigation and Prosecution of the Murder of President Kennedy| url = https://books.google.com/?id=vtt3AAAAMAAJ| date = November 1988| publisher = Sheridan Square Pubns| isbn = 978-0-941781-02-2| page = 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[trial of Clay Shaw]] began in January 1969 in Orleans Parish Criminal Court. The jury acquitted Shaw.

Several films have fictionalized a trial of Oswald, depicting what may have happened had Ruby not killed Oswald. ''[[The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald (1964 film)|The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald]]'' (1964); ''[[The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald (1977 film)|The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald]]'' (1977); and ''On Trial: Lee Harvey Oswald'' (1986) have imagined such a trial. In 1988, a 21-hour unscripted mock trial was held on television, argued by lawyers before a &lt;!--I'd like to say "sitting" or "retired" judge, but I don't know which it is--&gt; judge,&lt;ref&gt;Bugliosi, ''Reclaiming History''&lt;/ref&gt; with unscripted testimony from surviving witnesses to the events surrounding the assassination; the jury returned a verdict of guilty. In 1992 the American Bar Association conducted two mock Oswald trials. The first trial ended in a hung jury. In the second trial the jury acquitted Oswald.

During the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] militant groups, paramilitary groups and government security forces were accused of [[assassination|assassinating]] many [[public figure]]s on suspicion of being sympathizers or informants, in retaliation for killings and attacks, to eliminate competition from rival groups, or to stifle dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Philip Alston |title=Civil and Political Rights, Including the Question of Disappearances and Summary Executions |publisher=[[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] |date=27 March 2006 |url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/docs/62chr/E_CN4_2006_53_Add5.doc |format=DOC |accessdate=27 March 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070306042111/http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/docs/62chr/E_CN4_2006_53_Add5.doc |archivedate = 6 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a list of '''notable assassinations of the Sri Lankan Civil War''', attributed by various self-admissions, [[NGO]]s, [[United Nations]] agencies, foreign governments, and the state-owned media of [[Sri Lanka]].

==Background==
The [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] was in a conflict on the [[island]]-nation of [[Sri Lanka]]. Between 1983 and 2009 there was an intermittent [[civil war]], predominantly between the [[Government of Sri Lanka|government]] and the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE), a [[Separatism|separatist]] militant organisation who during this time fought for the creation of an [[Independence|independent]] state named [[Tamil Eelam]] in the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|North]] and [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|East]] of the island. The [[UN]] has estimated that up to 100,000 people (combatants and civilians) may have been killed during the 26 years of fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/05/20/2576543.htm | title =Up to 100,000 killed in Sri Lanka's civil war: UN| publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date = 20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The civil war has caused significant harm to the population and [[Economy of Sri Lanka|economy]] of the country, as well as leading to the ban of the LTTE as a [[terrorist]] organisation in 32 countries including the [[United States]], [[Australia]], the countries of the [[European Union]] and [[Canada]]. The war ended in May 2009 when the Sri Lankan military defeated the LTTE. Numerous [[human rights]] violations have been committed by both the Sri Lankan military and the LTTE, including the assassination of individuals by both sides. A majority of the notable figures on this list were members of the Tamil community in Sri Lanka, and in many instances were allegedly assassinated by the LTTE for taking moderate political stances, or for rejecting militant action and attempting to engage in the democratic process in Sri Lanka.

==Famous historical escapes==
[[File:Famous adventures and prison escapes of the civil war (1893) (14573020789).jpg|{{largethumb}}|On November 27, 1863, [[John Hunt Morgan]] and six of his officers, most notably [[Thomas Hines]], escaped from their cells in the [[Ohio Penitentiary]] by digging a tunnel from Hines' cell into the inner yard and then ascending a wall with a rope made from bunk coverlets and a bent poker iron.]]

There have been many infamous escapes throughout history:

===13th century===
* In 1244, whilst imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]], [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr]] crafted a make-shift rope made of bed sheets and cloths, lowered it, and climbed down. However, because he was heavy, the rope broke and as a consequence, he fell to his death.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8QY7AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT135&amp;dq=gruffydd+ap+llywelyn+fawr+death+rope&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2i-Gvif7XAhVE-qQKHbfaD2sQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=gruffydd%20ap%20llywelyn%20fawr%20death%20rope&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
* In 1621 Dutch author [[Hugo Grotius]] escaped from [[Loevestein|Loevestein Castle]] where he was held captive by hiding himself inside a book chest. He was then smuggled outside.

===18th century===

* Englishman [[Jack Sheppard]] took to theft and burglary in 1723, and was arrested and imprisoned five times in 1724 but escaped four times, making him a notorious public figure and wildly popular with the poorer classes.
* The Italian author and adventurer [[Giacomo Casanova]] escaped from prison in 1757.

===19th century===
*In the [[Libby Prison Escape]], during the [[American Civil War]], over 109 [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[POWs]] broke out of a building at [[Libby Prison]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]] on the night between February 9 and February 10, 1864. All but 50 (two were drowned in the nearby [[James River (Virginia)|James River]]) successfully reached back to Union lines.
*The notorious outlaw [[Billy The Kid]] managed to escape from prison in 1881, but was captured and shot by [[Pat Garrett]] only a few months later.

===1900–1950===
* In 1901, [[Lum You]] was convicted of murder and sentenced to death by a [[Pacific County, Washington]] court.  He enjoyed great public sympathy, including from county officials, who supposedly allowed him to escape by leaving his cell door unlocked at night. He eventually seized the opportunity, but within a few days he either gave himself up or was recaptured.&lt;ref name="stevens"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sydney |last=Stevens |title=Behind Bars in Old Pacific County, 1902: The Hanging of Lum You |newspaper=Chinook Observer |date=June 7, 2011 |url=http://www.chinookobserver.com/news/history/the-hanging-of-lum-you/article_303b3b2a-912f-11e0-a1e7-001cc4c002e0.html |accessdate=August 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503121544/http://www.chinookobserver.com/news/history/the-hanging-of-lum-you/article_303b3b2a-912f-11e0-a1e7-001cc4c002e0.html |archivedate=May 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="espy"&gt;{{cite book | first=Willard R. | last=Espy | authorlink=Willard R.

* German Naval Air Service Kapitänleutnant [[Gunther Plüschow]] escaped from the [[Donington Hall]] [[prisoner of war camp]] in 1915.
* [[Frederick Mors]], an Austrian-born American serial killer, was declared insane and placed into the Matteawan Institution for the Insane in the United States in 1915. He escaped in 1916 and was never seen again.
*Leonard T. Fristoe was imprisoned for double murder in 1920 of a police Constable and a deputy Sherriff in Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.odmp.org/officer/17466-constable-arthur-j-st-clair ODMP memorial]&lt;/ref&gt; He escaped from Nevada State Prison in 1923. He lived for nearly 46 years under the allias of Claude R. Willis, before being turned in by his own son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-11000/longest-prison-escape/ |title=Longest prison escape |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving several years in prison he died of natural causes .
* [[John Dillinger]] served time at the Indiana State Penitentiary at Michigan City, until 1933, when he was paroled. Within four months, he was back in jail in [[Lima, Ohio]], but his gang sprang him, killing the jailer, Sheriff Jessie Sarber. Most of the gang was captured again by the end of the year in [[Tucson, Arizona]], due to a fire at the Historic Hotel Congress. Dillinger alone was sent to the Lake County jail in [[Crown Point, Indiana]]. He was to face trial for the suspected killing of police officer William O'Malley during a bank shootout in [[East Chicago, Indiana]], some time after his escape from jail. During this time on trial, a famous photograph was taken of Dillinger putting his arm on prosecutor Robert Estill's shoulder when suggested to him by reporters.
* On March 3, 1934, Dillinger escaped from the "escape-proof" (as it was dubbed by local authorities at the time) Crown Point, Indiana county jail, which was guarded by many police officers and national guardsmen. Newspapers reported that Dillinger had escaped using a fake gun made from wood, blackened and shined with shoe polish.
* French prisoner [[René Belbenoît]] escaped from the penal colony of French Guiana on March 2, 1935 when he and five others took to the sea with a boat they had bought. After a series of daring adventures, during which all of the other escapees were captured, he reached United States in 1937. In 1938 his account, ''Dry Guillotine'', was published. Belbenoît had written it in French and it was translated in English by Preston Rambo. It went through 14 printings in less than a year.
* Japanese murderer [[Yoshie Shiratori]] broke out of prison four times between the 1930s and 1940s. A novel and TV-drama ''Hagoku'' was based on his true story.
* [[Fort San Cristóbal (Spain)|Fort San Cristóbal]] is located on the top of the mountain San Cristóbal, which is very close (4&amp;nbsp;km) to [[Pamplona]], [[Spain]]. Built inside the mountain and obsolete since its opening in 1919, due to its weakness against aviation, it served as a prison. On May 22, 1938, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], around 30 prisoners organised a mutiny for a massive prison break. 792 prisoners fled but only three succeeded in getting to the [[France|French]] border; 585 were arrested, 211 died and 14 of the arrested who were considered the leaders were sentenced to death. Most fugitives were intercepted during the following days. In 1988, a sculpture was erected to honour the memory of the Republican people dead there. The fort ceased to be a prison in 1945.
* [[Colditz Castle]] was used as an "escape-proof" prisoner-of-war camp during [[World War II]], but over the course of 300 escape attempts, 130 prisoners escaped.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Thirty escapees eventually managed to reach friendly territory. The men had tunneled, disguised themselves as guards, workmen or women, sneaked away through sewer drains, and even planned to use a glider to get over the wall.
* [[André Devigny]], a French resistance fighter during World War II, escaped [[Fort Montluc|Montluc Military Prison]] in Lyons with his cellmate in April 1943.
* French author [[Henri Charrière]] tried to escape in vain several times, but eventually was successful in 1943. His story, ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]'', was published and filmed [[Papillon (1973 film)|under the same name]].
* In [[Stalag Luft III|the Great Escape]], 76 Allied POWs (primarily Commonwealth airmen) escaped from [[Stalag Luft III]] during World War II. 73 of the escapees were captured and fifty of them were executed by the [[Gestapo]], while only three succeeded in reaching neutral territories.
*In the [[Cowra breakout]], at least 545 out of approximately 1000 Japanese POWs escaped from Number 12 POW Compound at Cowra on the night of 4 August 1944. Out of the roughly 500 escapees, 231 died  and 108 were wounded. 31 killed themselves and 12 were burnt to death in huts set on fire by the Japanese. Sixteen of the wounded showed signs of attempted suicide.&lt;ref name="memorial"&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=Gavin|year=1963|chapter-url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070308--1-.pdf|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1070206/|title=The Final Campaigns|chapter=Appendix 5 – The Prison Break at Cowra, August 1944|series=Australia in the War of 1939–1945. Series 1&amp;nbsp;– Army|volume=Volume 7|location=Canberra|publisher=Australian War Memorial|oclc=1297619|pp=623–624}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[Great Papago Escape]], over 25 German POWs escaped by tunneling out of [[Camp Papago Park|Camp Papago Park POW facility]], near [[Phoenix, Arizona]], on the night of December 23, 1944. They then fled into the surrounding desert but because the rivers in Arizona were mostly dry and had not been navigable for decades, most of them were recaptured without bloodshed over the next few weeks.
*In the [[Acre Prison break]], 28 members of the Jewish underground groups [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] escaped from [[Acre Prison]] in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Mandatory Palestine]] (now [[Israel]]) on May 4, 1947.

===1950–1975===
*In 1959, [[Frank Freshwaters]] escaped from an Ohio prison while serving a sentence of involuntary manslaughter from a 1957 car accident. After 56 years he was arrested in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/shawshank-redemption-real-frank-freshwater-captured-after-56-years-run-fugitive-1910767 IB Tribune]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[June 1962 Alcatraz escape|Alcatraz escape on June 11, 1962]], American criminals brothers [[June 1962 Alcatraz escape#John and Clarence Anglin|John and Clarence Anglin]], and [[Frank Morris (prisoner)|Frank Morris]] escaped [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]] on [[Alcatraz Island]] using an inflatable raft, never to be seen again. It was never determined by the [[FBI]] whether they succeeded in their escape or died in the attempt.
*In 1973, three [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] prisoners escaped in the [[1973 Mountjoy Prison helicopter escape|Mountjoy Prison helicopter escape]], when a hijacked helicopter landed in the exercise yard at [[Mountjoy Prison]], [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland]].
*In 1975, 28-year-old American convicted [[drug smuggler]] [[Billy Hayes (writer)|Billy Hayes]] escaped from a prison in [[İmralı]], [[Turkey]], using a rowboat. He made his way to [[Istanbul]], then to Greece, where he was eventually deported to the U.S. Hayes wrote a book on his experiences, ''[[Midnight Express (book)|Midnight Express]]'', which was later adapted into the 1978 film ''[[Midnight Express (film)|of the same name]]'' starring [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]] as Hayes.

===1975–1999===
*On 5 April 1976, in the [[Segovia prison break]], twenty nine prisoners escape from prison, in Spain's largest prison break since the country's [[Spanish civil war|civil war]]. The majority belong to the [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] [[separatism|separatist]] group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]. The majority of prisoners are recaptured in shoot outs with the authorities in the next few days, during which one escapee is killed, though four manage to escape to France.     
*In 1977, the convicted murderer of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[James Earl Ray]], escaped from Brushy Mountain State Prison in Tennessee, along with six others. Ray was recaptured after two days. He had been running and hiding in the mountainous forest surrounding the prison.
*In 1977, convicted murderer James Robert Jones escaped from prison in Kansas, and lived in Florida for 37 years under the alias of Bruce Walter Keith. He was arrested in March 2014. It is assumed that he used someone else's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11222409 |title=Murderer caught after 37 years on run - World - NZ Herald News |publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date=2014-03-19 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1979, [[Assata Shakur]] successfully escaped prison in Union, New Jersey when three members of the Black Liberation Army took prison guards as hostages, freed Assata and fled in a prison van. No one was injured during the prison break, including the guards-turned-hostages who were left in the parking lot. In 1984, Shakur escaped to Cuba where she gained political asylum. Shakur was moved to the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists List on May 2, 2013.
* On 2 March 1982 in [[Peru]], [[Shining Path|PCP]] guerilla fighters [[Assault of Ayacucho prison|assaulted the Ayacucho prison]], resulting in the release of 255 inmates.
* In the [[1983 Batticaloa Jailbreak]] on 23 September 1983, 41 [[Tamil people|Tamil]] political prisoners and 151 criminal prisoners escaped in eastern [[Sri Lanka]].
* In the [[Maze Prison escape]] on 25 September 1983, 38 [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] members escaped from [[HMP Maze]] in [[Northern Ireland]], the biggest prison escape in Irish or British history.
* In 1984, six death row inmates escaped [[Mecklenburg Correctional Center]], making it the largest mass death row escape in American history. All were recaptured within 18 days, and all six men would eventually be executed. The final execution took place in 1996.
* On 7 March 1993, [[Peter Gibb]] and Archie Butterley escaped from the [[HM Melbourne Assessment Prison|Melbourne Remand Centre]] in Australia, with the help of prison guard Heather Parker who was having a relationship with Gibb. Police found Butterley shot dead six days later, and re-captured Gibb.
* [[Trikala]], [[Greece]], on May 23, 1995, Albanian inmates staged a daring escape from an old Turkish administration building-turned-prison, using weight dumbbells to break the locks of the gates and bed springs as a ladder to scale the wall. 29 prisoners escaped, and about half of them absconded to [[Albania]] and were never recaptured. Only Albanian inmates escaped, having kept escape plans secret from the prison's international population.
* In the [[1995 Vellore Fort Jailbreak]] on 15 August 1995, 43 [[Tamil Tigers|Tamil Tiger]] inmates escaped from [[Vellore Fort]] prison in India.
* In 1998, the Belgian child molester [[Marc Dutroux]] notoriously managed to escape for a few hours. He was caught the same afternoon, but the incident forced two politicians to resign and deepened the loss of faith in the Belgian judicial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/88889.stm|title=BBC News - EUROPE - Dutroux re-enacts escape|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1999, [[Leslie Dale Martin]] and three other inmates on [[Louisiana]]'s [[death row]] escaped from their cells at the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]].  They were caught within hours, before they even managed to escape prison grounds.  The four men had managed the escape with the use of [[hacksaws]] that had been smuggled in for them by a bribed corrections officer.  Other officers were inattentive to the inmates' two to three week effort at cutting their cell doors and window.  After the escape, two corrections officers were fired and two others were demoted.  Two corrections officers later overheard Martin plotting another escape, which included taking hostages and commandeering a vehicle to ram the prison's front gates.  Martin was immediately moved to the holding cell outside the [[death chamber]], a month before his [[execution]] in 2002.

===2000–present===

*Three inmates at an [[Arizona State Prison - Kingman|Arizona State Prison]] for-profit [[Management and Training Corporation]]-operated facility escaped on July 30, 2010. Daniel Renwick and Tracy Province were murderers and John McCluskey had been convicted of attempted murders. Renwick was captured in a shootout in Rifle, Colorado on August 1, 2010. Though he still had 32 years on his sentence in Arizona, he was sentenced to 60 years to be served in Colorado. Province, already a lifer, was captured on August 9, 2010 in Meeteese, Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Inmate Sentenced in Arizona Prison Escape|url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/first-inmate-charged-in-arizona-prison-escape-114812684.html|accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being sentenced to 38 1/3 years in Arizona, he was quickly extradited to face murder charges in New Mexico. McCluskey, who had been doing consecutive 15-year sentences, was captured with Casslyn Welch, his cousin/accomplice, in eastern Arizona on August 19 in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. He was sentenced to 43 years in an Arizona prison on escape, kidnap, hijacking and robbery charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arizona inmate gets 43 years for his escape|url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/arizona-inmate-gets-43-years-in-prison-after-escape-124114574.html|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Province, Welch and McCluskey were soon extradited for the alleged robbery, hijack and murder of two vacationers in New Mexico.

* In October 2013, Kevin Patrick Stoeser escaped from the Austin Transitional Center where he was serving the remainder of a 156-month sentence for four counts of child sexual assault and one count of possession of child pornography.

An "external breach" was found on a street approximately 500 feet south of the prison wall. Both inmates had been convicted of murder. Richard Matt was shot dead on June 26, 2015 near Lake Titus in Upstate New York. Two days later on June 28, 2015, David Sweat was captured just miles from the Canada–US border, shot twice before taken to a local hospital.
*On July 11, 2015, Mexican drug lord [[Joaquín Guzmán|Joaquín Guzmán Loera]], also known as 'El Chapo', escaped from Federal Social Readaptation Center No.1, a maximum security prison. His escape involved an elaborate underground tunnel leading from the shower area in his cell stretching 1.5&amp;nbsp;km to a house construction site. The shower area in his cell was not detectable to the security cameras, creating a blind spot. The tunnel lay 10 meters underground and was equipped with a ladder to climb to the bottom, artificial lights, air ducts and various construction materials. A makeshift motorcycle was found in the tunnel, believed to have been used to excavate the tons of earth removed, transport materials and Guzmán himself. An investigation and manhunt quickly followed.  He was recaptured on January 8, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CNNMex/status/685527281587097601|title=CNN México on Twitter|work=Twitter|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three inmates (Jonathan Tieu, 20; Hossein Nayeri, 37; and Bac Tien Duong, 43) cut through steel bars, made their way through plumbing tunnels, and a used a makeshift rope made out of bed sheets to rappel down the multistory facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = California jail escape: 3 inmates on the loose - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/24/us/california-escaped-inmates/index.html|website = CNN|access-date = 2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bac Tien Duong surrendered to police in Santa Ana CA on January 29. The other two inmates, Hossein Nayeri and Jonathan Tieu, were arrested in San Francisco on January 30.
*On November 7, 2016, two inmates escaped HMP Pentonville in North London. The two inmates (Mathew Baker and James Whitlock) used diamond-tipped cutting equipment to break through cell bars before they scaled the perimeter wall. They left mannequins in their beds to fool the prison guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-37899401|title=Two Pentonville prisoners escape over perimeter wall|date=2016-11-07|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Baker was found – with dyed hair and a fractured leg – hiding under a bed at his sister’s home. Whitlock was found at an address in Homerton, east London, after six days on the run.

The '''Lompoc Valley Flower Festival''' is an annual [[flower festival]] held in the city of [[Lompoc, California|Lompoc]], located northern [[Santa Barbara County, California]].

The event is organized and coordinated by The Lompoc Valley Festival Association, and is held annually at Ryon Memorial Park, for 5 days from Wednesday to Sunday on the last full weekend in June.

The Flower Festival started in 1952 and is named after the commercial flower fields that used to be plentiful around the city and Lompoc Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.springartsfestival.org/7.html|title = The Lompoc Valley Festival Associations Story| publisher=The Lompoc valley Festival Association|accessdate= June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival features a carnival, live entertainment, food, arts and crafts, and a commercial flower center. The event includes the crowning of a Flower Festival Queen, and the Flower Festival [[Parade]] on Saturday morning.

==History==
The Lompoc Valley Flower Festival was established in 1952, at first not as a flower festival but as an annual [[rodeo]] and parade. The original event grew until one of Lompoc's leading citizens at the time, George Miller, began championing for the Flower Festival.  Miller persuaded Lompoc's Chamber of Commerce to change from the rodeo and parade event, reasoning "''that while more than 200 California communities staged rodeos each year, large and small, Lompoc had its world famous flower fields, an asset that was unique and the perfect basis for the community event''".

The flower festival was developed around The Alpha Clubs Flower Show, which had previously been going since 1922. It started out as a 2 day event, but has grown over the years to a 5 day event. Nowadays, the biggest part of the festival is the parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.springartsfestival.org/7.html|title = The Lompoc Valley Festival Associations Story| publisher=The Lompoc valley Festival Association|accessdate= June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parade==
The Flower Festival Parade occurs annually on the Saturday morning of the festival.  It starts in downtown, travels through town, and concludes at the festival's site in Ryon Memorial Park, . The parade's route follows [[California State Route 1#Central Coast and Big Sur|"H" Street]] and [[California State Route 246|Ocean Avenue]]. Each float is required to be constructed of flowers and/or natural materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.flowerfestival.org/3|title = 61st Annual Flower Festival| publisher=The Lompoc valley Festival Association|accessdate= June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucas Oil Sportsman Cup''' is a Canadian [[stock car racing]] series. Founded in 2007 as the Ontario Sportsman Series, it is the unofficial successor to the [[CASCAR]] Sportsman Series, after [[NASCAR]] purchased [[CASCAR]] it was announced that there would be no equivalent of the former CASCAR Sportsman Series in 2007. The series is based on the 2005 CASCAR Sportsman series rulebook omitting the 2006 additions ([[HANS device]], firesuits for ‘over the wall’ crews, etc.). The series first major sponsor in 2007 was [[Castrol|Castrol Canada]]. In January 2009 [[Lucas Oil]] came on board as the title sponsor and the series was renamed The Lucas Oil Sportsman Cup.  Originally events featured a twin 50 lap format which changed in 2011 to the 100 lap feature still used today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17974">[[File:Sir William Crookes and Katie King.jpg|thumb|A depiction of Sir [[William Crookes]] confronting the alleged spirit materialization of [[Katie King (spirit)|Katie King]]]]
In [[spiritualism]], [[paranormal]] literature and some [[religion]]s, '''materialization''' (or '''manifestation''') is the creation or appearance of [[matter]] from unknown sources. The existence of materialization has not been confirmed by laboratory experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roach|first1=Mary|authorlink=Mary Roach|title=Six Feet Over: Adventures in the Afterlife|date=2008|publisher=Canongate|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9781847670809|pages=122–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous cases of fraudulent materialization demonstrations by mediums have been exposed.

==History==

In the early 20th century a series of exposures of fraudulent activity led to a decline of materialization séances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melton|first1=J. Gordon|authorlink=J. Gordon Melton|title=The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena|date=2008|publisher=Visible Ink Press|location=Detroit, Michigan|isbn=9781578592098|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Robert Browning]] and his wife [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Elizabeth]] attended a séance on 23, July 1855 in Ealing with the Rymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Donald|authorlink=Donald Serrell Thomas|title=Robert Browning: A Life Within a Life|date=1989|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9780297796398|pages=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the séance a spirit face materialized which Home claimed was the son of Browning who had died in infancy. Browning seized the "materialization" and discovered it to be the bare foot of Home. To make the deception worse, Browning had never lost a son in infancy. Browning's son [[Robert Barrett Browning|Robert]] in a letter to ''[[The Times]]'', December 5, 1902 referred to the incident "Home was detected in a vulgar fraud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Houdini|first1=Harry|title=A Magician Among the Spirits|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781108027489|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aNUo2iJ5wZIC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=%22london+times%22+browning+home&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qeKLUqWhJ4aqhQevsYHIBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22london%20times%22%20browning%20home&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casey|first1=John|authorlink=John Casey (academic)|title=After Lives: A Guide to Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780199975037|page=373|quote=The poet attended one of Home's seances where a face was materialized, which, Home's spirit guide announced, was that of Browning's dead son. Browning seized the supposed materialized head, and it turned out to be the bare foot of Home. The deception was not helped by the fact that Browning never had lost a son in infancy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British materialization medium Rosina Mary Showers was caught in many fraudulent séances throughout her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Sherrie Lynne|authorlink=Sherrie Lynne Lyons|title=Species, Serpents, Spirits, and Skulls: Science at the Margins in the Victorian Age|date=2010|publisher=State Univ Of New York Pr|location=Albany|isbn=9781438427980|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 during a séance with [[Edward William Cox]] a sitter looked into the cabinet and seized the spirit, the [[Headgear|headdress]] fell off and was revealed to be Showers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Owen|first1=Alex|title=The Darkened Room: Women, Power and Spiritualism in late Victorian England|date=2004|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226642055|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 29 and May 21, 1874 [[Florence Cook]] in her own Home held séances with William Crookes. It was alleged that a spirit called "[[Katie King (spirit)|Katie King]]" materialized, however according to the author Walter Mann "Katie was a confederate introduced by Florrie Cook. It was the easiest matter in the world to carry out this trick, since the room, described by Sir William as the "cabinet", was Florrie Cook's bedroom."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Mann. (1919). ''The Follies and Frauds of Spiritualism''. Rationalist Association. London: Watts &amp; Co. p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Herne a medium who formed a partnership with Charles Williams was repeatedly exposed in fraudulent materialization séances.&lt;ref name="McHargue"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McHargue|first1=Georgess|authorlink=Georgess McHargue|title=Facts, Frauds, and Phantasms: A Survey of the Spiritualist Movement|date=1972|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=0385053053|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|113}} In 1875, he was caught pretending to be a spirit during a séance in Liverpool and was found "clothed in about two yards of stiffened muslin, wound round his head and hanging down as far as his thigh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oppenheim|first1=Janet|title=The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, Cambridgeshire|isbn=9780521265058|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florence Cook]] had been "trained in the arts of the séance" by Herne and was repeatedly exposed as a fraudulent medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurtz|first1=Paul|authorlink=Paul Kurtz|title=A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology|date=1985|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Buffalo, New York|isbn=9780879753009|page=29|quote=Florence Cook was caught cheating not only before her séances with Crookes but also afterward. Furthermore, she learned her trade from the mediums Frank Herne and Charles Williams, who were notorious for their cheating.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keene|first1=M. Lamar|last2=Rauscher|first2=William V.|authorlink=M. Lamar Keene|title=[[The Psychic Mafia]]|date=1997|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=9781573921619|page=64|quote=The most famous of materialization mediums, Florence Cook-- though she managed to convince a scientist, Sir William Crookes, that she was genuine-- was repeatedly exposed in fraud. Florence had been trained in the arts of the séance by Frank Herne, a well-known physical medium whose materializations were grabbed on more than one occasion and found to be the medium himself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychical researchers [[W. W. Baggally]] and [[Everard Feilding]] exposed the British materialization medium Christopher Chambers as a fraud in 1905. A false moustache was discovered in the séance room which he used to fabricate the spirit materializations.&lt;ref name="Wiseman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiseman|first1=Richard|authorlink=Richard Wiseman|title=Deception &amp; Self-Deception: Investigating Psychics|date=1997|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=9781573921213|pages=12–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British medium Charles Eldred was exposed as a fraud in 1906. Eldred would sit in a chair in a curtained off area in the room known as a "séance cabinet". Various spirit figures would emerge from the cabinet and move around the séance room, however, it was discovered that the chair had a secret compartment that contained beards, cloths, [[mask]]s, and wigs that Eldred would dress up in to fake the spirits.&lt;ref name="Wiseman"/&gt;

[[Albert von Schrenck-Notzing]] investigated the medium [[Eva Carrière]] and claimed her ectoplasm "materializations" were the result of "ideoplasty" in which the medium could form images onto ectoplasm from her mind.&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brower|first1=M.

Critics pointed out the photographs of the ectoplasm revealed marks of magazine cut-outs, pins and a piece of string.&lt;ref name="Heredia"&gt;[[Carlos María de Heredia]]. (1922). ''Spiritism and Common Sense''. P. J. Kenedy &amp; Sons. pp. 186-198&lt;/ref&gt; Schrenck-Notzing admitted that on several occasions Carrière deceptively smuggled pins into the séance room.&lt;ref name="Heredia"/&gt; The magician [[Carlos María de Heredia]] replicated the ectoplasm of Carrière using a comb, gauze and a handkerchief.&lt;ref name="Heredia"/&gt;

[[Donald J. West|Donald West]] wrote that the [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] of Carrière was fake and was made of cut-out paper faces from [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s on which fold marks could sometimes be seen from the photographs. A photograph of Carrière taken from the back of the ectoplasm face revealed it to be made from a magazine cut out with the letters "Le Miro". The two-dimensional face had been clipped from the French magazine Le Miroir.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald J. West|Donald West]]. (1954). ''Psychical Research Today''. Chapter Séance-Room Phenomena. Duckworth. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Back issues of the magazine also matched some of Carrière's ectoplasm faces.&lt;ref name="McHargue"/&gt;{{rp|187}} Cut out faces that she used included [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|King Ferdinand of Bulgaria]], French president [[Raymond Poincaré]] and the actress Mona Delza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stein|first1=Gordon|authorlink=Gordon Stein|title=The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal|date=1996|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=9781573920216|page=520|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Schrenck-Notzing discovered Carrière had taken her ectoplasm faces from the magazine he defended her by claiming she had read the magazine but her memory had recalled the images and they had materialized into the ectoplasm.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt; Because of this Schrenck-Notzing was described as credulous.&lt;ref name="Heredia"/&gt; [[Joseph McCabe]] wrote "In Germany and Austria, Baron von Schrenck-Notzing is the laughing-stock of his medical colleagues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Frank|title=Debates on the Meaning of Life, Evolution, and Spiritualism|date=1993|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Buffalo, New York|isbn=9780879758288|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bowl of hot paraffin was placed in the room and according to Kluski spirits dipped their limbs into the [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]] and then into a bath of water to materialize. Three other series of séances were held in Warsaw in Kluski's own apartment, these took place over a period of three years. Kluski was not searched in any of the séances. Photographs of the molds were obtained during the four series of experiments and were published by Geley in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chéroux|first1=Clément|title=The Perfect Medium: Photography and the Occult|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Connecticut|isbn=9780300111361|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogo|first1=D.

As a series of pictures for a newspaper of the time shows, he immersed his hand in the hot paraffin, let it dry, and then carefully removed the hand from it. When one experiments with this technique, one realizes that it is not the plaster cast that has to be removed from the thin wax mold, which would be impossible to do without breaking the mold. One almost forgets that what has to be removed is the living hand, possibly the best-suited object to slip out of a mold without damaging it. In fact, a real hand is even more effective than any other artifice dreamed up to substitute for it. First, the paraffin doesn't stick to skin, only to quite long hair. Nonetheless, if one moves the fingers very slowly, one will realize that every small bit one pulls out will gradually allow the rest of the hand to be removed; that's similar to what happens when one pulls off a tight glove.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erlendur Haraldsson]] investigated one of the [[Hindu]] [[swami]]s, who are associated with frequent and widely accepted claims of materializations of objects or substances, namely Gyatri Swami, and reached a negative conclusion regarding his claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haraldsson|first1=Erlendur|last2=Houtkooper|first2=Joop M.|title=Report on an Indian Swami Claiming to Materialize Objects: The Value and Limitations of Field Observations|journal=Journal of Scientific Explanation|date=October 1994|volume=8|issue=3|pages=381–397|url=https://www.scientificexploration.org/docs/8/jse_08_3_haraldsson.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2017|publisher=Society for Scientific Explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22232">[[File:911dispatchcenter.jpg|thumb|right|Public Safety Answering Point, where 9-1-1 calls are handled]]
'''Denise Amber Lee''' was [[murder]]ed by Michael King in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Florida]] on January 17, 2008, after he had [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] and [[rape]]d her earlier in the day.

Lee and several others had attempted to call for help through the [[9-1-1]] system but there was a lack of communication and the police and other emergency services arrived too late. Five 9-1-1 calls were made that day, including one by Lee herself from her abductor's phone and one from a witness, Jane Kowalski, who gave a detailed account of events as they unfolded before her. Failures were later found in the way the 9-1-1 operators handled Kowalski's call and further failures were later identified nationwide in the 9-1-1 system. King was sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="NBC-2 King sentence" /&gt;

The Denise Amber Lee Act was passed unanimously by the [[Florida Legislature]] on April 24, 2008.&lt;ref name="CS/SB 1694" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HT DAL Act passed" /&gt; This act provides for optional training for 9-1-1 operatives. Lee's family continue to lobby for a new law to be passed nationwide which would institute mandatory training and certification for all 9-1-1 dispatchers. The Denise Amber Lee Foundation was established in June 2008 to promote such training as well as to raise public awareness of the issues involved.

==Denise Amber Lee==
Denise Amber Lee (née Goff) (August 6, 1986 – January 17, 2008) was born in [[Englewood, Florida]]. Lee was the daughter of Sgt. Rick Goff, of the sheriff's office in [[Charlotte County, Florida]]&lt;ref name="dateline transcript" /&gt; and Sue Goff.&lt;ref name="HT on verdict" /&gt; Not long after their first date, Lee's future husband, Nathan, bought her a $40 heart-shaped ring which she never removed. The ring would later become key evidence connecting perpetrator and victim.&lt;ref name="dateline transcript" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN penalty" /&gt;

==Michael King==
Michael King (born 1971) trained as a plumber&lt;ref name="UPI followup" /&gt; but had been unemployed for several months prior to the crime and was facing foreclosure on his home in North Port. He was married, but is now divorced.&lt;ref name="HT breaking"/&gt; He has a low IQ and family members described to the court how King had had an accident while sledding as a child; an expert witness described the subsequent injury as a "divot" in his brain.&lt;ref name="CNN penalty" /&gt;

==Crime==
On January 17, 2008,&lt;ref name="HT breaking" /&gt;&lt;ref name="911 dispatch" /&gt; Michael King abducted Denise Amber Lee from her home. He drove her around, tied up in his vehicle, for quite some time; several people witnessed the journey. Later, King raped and murdered Lee and buried her in a shallow grave. Her body was found on January 19, 2008. King was later found guilty of kidnapping, sexual battery and first degree murder; he was sentenced to death and is presently detained awaiting execution.&lt;ref name="NBC-2 King sentence" /&gt;

Nathan Lee was at work that Thursday (January 17, 2008); his wife, Denise Lee, was at home with their young children. She called him at 11:21&amp;nbsp;a.m., the last time the two would speak. Among the topics discussed was the nice weather: the couple decided that the windows should be opened at their home.  She said she had already opened them. Nathan Lee arrived home around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. to find the windows closed, his wife missing and the children home alone in the same crib. This prompted him to make his 9-1-1 call, the first of the day related to this crime.

A neighbor saw a car arrive at Lee's home around 2 p.m. The car was later identified as Michael King's dark green 1994 [[Chevy Camaro]].

Lee was bound and taken to King's home in North Port, Florida, where he set up what the prosecution in the trial referred to as a "rape room".  [[Duct tape]] and other evidence was found in this room.

She was then taken to King's cousin Harold Muxlow's home, where King then borrowed a shovel, a gas can, and a flashlight. Lee was able to take King's [[Mobile phone|cell phone]] while he was out of the vehicle and dial 9-1-1. Her desperate 9-1-1 call was released during the trial, which caused a lot of reaction by the public. The operator obtained information from Lee which later helped convict King. The call is several minutes long with Lee begging for her life saying "please" 17 times. She answered the call taker's questions while pretending to talk to King. Judge Deno Economou, the presiding judge over the murder trial, noted how unusual and rare it was to hear a murder victim's last words. Prosecutors said later that Lee had given them their best evidence that she was taken against her will, she did not know her abductor and her subsequent murder was premeditated. Lee was unable to give her exact location.&lt;ref name="MSC day two" /&gt; Police were unable to trace the location of the caller (Denise Amber Lee) because it was made on a prepaid wireless phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mullins|first=Richard|work=[[The Tampa Tribune]]|url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2009/feb/20/wp-prepaid-phones-hit-and-miss-when-using-911/|title=Prepaid phones hit and miss when using 911|date=2009-02-20|accessdate=2011-02-04|publisher=Tampa Bay Online c/o Media General Communications Holdings, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., a witness, Jane Kowalski, heard screaming from a car next to hers at a stoplight. Kowalski called 9-1-1 to report what she believed to be a child abduction.&lt;ref name="MSC 911" /&gt;

At 9:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., roughly six hours after Lee was first reported missing,&lt;ref name="HT Map" /&gt; King was arrested.

==Trial==
The trial of the State of Florida vs. Michael L. King officially began on August 24, 2009. Lead [[Prosecutor|prosecuting attorney]] was State Assistant Lon Arend, lead [[Attorney at law|defense attorney]] was [[Public defender|Public Defender]] Carolyn Schlemmer. The [[Judge|presiding judge]] was Hon. Deno Economou, and the trial took place in [[Sarasota County, Florida]].

The prosecution presented DNA and other [[Forensic identification|forensic evidence]], including hair and personal articles of Lee's found around and within the Camaro, King's home, and the grave site. Other evidence included King's change of clothing, duct tape, a shell casing, the shovel, and King's cell phone. The prosecution also called eyewitnesses, including Jane Kowalski and King's cousin. The defense attempted to provide [[Legal burden of proof|reasonable doubt]] by bringing to the jury's attention evidence tampering and contamination, and by suggesting that one of King's friends had committed the crime. The judge did not approve of the latter defense. The defense rested without calling any witnesses.

On August 28, 2009 after deliberating for two hours and five minutes, the jury found King guilty of [[kidnapping]] with intent to commit a felony, [[Battery (crime)|sexual battery]], and first degree [[murder]].&lt;ref name="CNN 911" /&gt;  On September 4, 2009, at 2:45 pm, the jury handed down the recommended sentence of death,&lt;ref name="CNN penalty" /&gt; in a 12–0 vote.&lt;ref name="HT jury" /&gt;

==The 9-1-1 calls==
In total, five 9-1-1 calls related to Lee's disappearance were placed by five different people between 3:29&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on January 17, 2008.&lt;ref name="dateline timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC botched" /&gt; Four were routed to operatives in [[Sarasota County, Florida]]; the other—placed by Jane Kowalski and the fourth in the sequence—was routed to operatives in neighboring [[Charlotte County, Florida]]. The call routed to Charlotte County was allegedly mishandled.&lt;ref name="SPT crime report" /&gt;

The second call was placed by Lee at 6:14&amp;nbsp;p.m. from her abductor's cell phone. This call was presented by the state prosecutors as part of the key evidence at King's trial.&lt;ref name="CNN 911" /&gt;

Jane Kowalski's call was placed by cell phone at 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. while she was driving on [[U.S. Route 41 in Florida|U.S. Route 41]].&lt;ref name = "SPT crime report" /&gt; "I was at a stoplight and a man pulled up next to me and there was a child screaming in the car," she said. She explained further that she heard "terrifying screaming" and that she had "never heard anything like that." Kowalski believed that she was witnessing a child abduction.  She also identified the car as a Camaro but stated the color as blue (rather than green). She stated that she had made eye contact with the driver after which "a hand came up and started banging on the passenger window." Since she had crossed the county line into Charlotte, the call was routed to Charlotte County's 9-1-1 call center. It was only after she saw the news the following day that she realized she had witnessed the abduction of Lee rather than that of a child. When she called the North Port Police Department to explain who she was and that she had made a 9-1-1 call, it became apparent that the call had not been forwarded to the correct authorities. It is this call that is alleged to have been mishandled due to the fact that the operatives neglected to file it correctly.&lt;ref name="SPT crime report" /&gt; This call was also presented by the state prosecutors as part of the key evidence at King's trial.&lt;ref name="CNN 911" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Due to Jane Kowalski's mishandled 9-1-1 call, more research revealed several issues countrywide in the 9-1-1 system, so a [[non-profit organization]] with the mission to "To promote and support public safety through uniform training, standardized protocols, defined measurable outcomes, and technological advances in the 9-1-1 system." was established in June 2008 in Lee's name.&lt;ref name="ABC reform report" /&gt;

On April 24, 2008, the Senate Bill, CS/SB 1694, concerning the Denise Amber Lee Act, which provides for voluntary training for 9-1-1 operatives, was passed unanimously by the [[Florida Legislature]].&lt;ref name="CS/SB 1694" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HT DAL Act passed" /&gt; The Act's passage into state law continues.&lt;ref name = "NC7 911 bill" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "NBC-2 911 bill" /&gt;

House Bill CS/HB 355&lt;ref name="CS/HB 355" /&gt; and Senate Bill CS/SB 742&lt;ref name="CS/SB 742" /&gt; are being considered at present in Tallahassee to address the fact that 9-1-1 operatives in the state are not required to undertake mandatory training.&lt;ref name="BH bill" /&gt; Lee's husband Nathan Lee and her father Rick Goff continue to lobby in Tallahassee to get [[Denise's Law]] passed, which would recommend mandatory training and certification for all 9-1-1 dispatchers.

A separate bill, sponsored by Representative [[Robert C. Schenck (politician)|Robert C. Schenck]], that would place significant limitations on 9-1-1 calls when played in public, is being considered by the Florida Legislature. The Lee family has spoken against this bill.&lt;ref name="PBP Schenk bill" /&gt; The Governor of Florida, [[Charlie Crist]], has said that he is "not favorably inclined toward the bill".&lt;ref name="PBP comment" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MH Schenk bill" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WON Schenk bill" /&gt;  The bill was later dropped.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5610">'''Preventable years of life lost (PrYLL)''' is an epidemiological measure. It is an estimate of the average years a person would have lived if s/he had not died prematurely due to a preventable cause of death.

PrYLL is closely related to [[Years of potential life lost|potential years of life lost (PYLL)]] and like PYLL, it gives more weight than mortality rates to deaths that occur among younger people. Unlike PYLL, PrYLL excludes causes of death that aren’t deemed to be preventable.

Premature deaths are those that could be avoided through public health interventions such as getting people to take more exercise or stop smoking, or in tackling the wider social determinants of health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/181103/Living_well_for_longer.pdf Living Well for Longer: A call to action to reduce avoidable premature mortality], Department of Health, March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Causes of death can be classified using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd.htm Introduction to ICD codes] The Centre for Communicable Diseases.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom’s [[Office of National Statistics|Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) has published lists of ICD codes that are deemed to be avoidable, amenable and preventable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/get-involved/consultations/archived-consultations/2011/definitions-of-avoidable-mortality/consultation-on-definitions-of-avoidable-mortality.pdf Definitions of Avoidable Mortality] Office for National Statistics. February 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this publication, the ONS proposes the following definition for preventable causes of death: “A death is preventable if, in the light of current understanding of the determinants of health, all or most deaths from that cause (subject to age limits if appropriate) could be avoided by public health interventions in the broadest sense”.

==History==

PrYLL was developed in 2012 by Errol Taylor at [http://www.rospa.com/ The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents] (RoSPA) to highlight the burden to society of accidental injury.

PrYLL features prominently in RoSPA’s Big Book of Accident Prevention &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rospa.com/bigbook/index.html RoSPA’s Big Book of Accident Prevention] RoSPA. December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and RoSPA’s guidance for local government decision-makers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rospa.com/about/currentcampaigns/publichealth/info/delivering-accident-prevention-context.pdf Delivering Accident Prevention at Local Level] RoSPA June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; which was supported by Public Health England(PHE) and funded by the UK Department of Health.

==Calculation==

To calculate the preventable years of life lost, the analyst has to set an upper reference age. This is essentially arbitrary and can be set, for example, to 65 to capture the whole population up to retirement, or 75 which, in developed countries, corresponds roughly to the life expectancy of the population being studied.

The analyst must then select the ICD codes for causes of death that are deemed by the ONS to be preventable.  The calculation can then proceed in the same way as for [[years of potential life lost]] (PYLL).

==Significance==

In the developed world, mortality counts and rates tend to emphasise the most common causes of death in older people because the risk of death increases with age. Since PrYLL excludes causes that aren’t deemed to be preventable and it gives more weight to deaths among young individuals, it is a powerful metric for those who want to draw attention to the premature and preventable loss of human potential. Some might argue that causes of death with the highest PrYLL should attract the greatest share of research and funding for prevention campaigns.

[[File:Preventable years of life lost in England and Wales, 2010.jpg|framed|center|% of total preventable years of life lost (PrYLL) in 2010, to people in England &amp; Wales up to the age of 60]]

==Comparison==

This table which contrasts the leading causes of death when measured first by PrYLL and then by the total number of deaths. The rankings are completely different, depending on which epidemiological measure is chosen. Accidental injuries rise from being the fifth cause of death in terms of mortality, to the leading cause in terms of PrYLL while cancers drop from being the leading cause of death to be being second when measured in terms of PrYLL.

'''Pro Musica Nova''' was a biennial festival for contemporary music sponsored by [[Radio Bremen]] from 1958 to 2001. It was founded by [[Hans Otte]]. A number of experimental and electronic composers contributed.

==History==
From 1960 it was held in alternate years to the Pro Musica Antiqua festival of the same radio station, which also ceased in 2001. The two festivals took their name from Pro Musica Antiqua founded by [[Safford Cape]] in the 1930s which had influenced the creation of [[Archiv Produktion]] by [[Deutsche Grammophon]].

Pro Musica Nova introduced the public to the music of composers including [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[John Cage]], [[Mauricio Kagel]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Terry Riley]], [[La Monte Young]], [[Conlon Nancarrow]] and [[Hans-Joachim Hespos]]. Otte also commissioned many new works for the festival.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kerala J. Snyder]] ''The Organ As a Mirror of Its Time'' University of Rochester  Professor Emerita of Musicology at The Eastman School of Music - 2002 Page 312 "When Hans Otte, then head of the contemporary music department of Radio Bremen, asked Ligeti and Hambraeus to contribute new organ works for a concert to take place in 1962 as part of the Radio Bremen series pro musica nova, they .."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6792">'''Progesterex''' is a fictitious [[date rape drug]] that would purportedly cause [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]]. It is part of a [[hoax]] that began to circulate in 1999 via [[e-mail]] on the [[internet]]. No actual drug by this name or even with these properties exists, and no such incident has ever been documented or confirmed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160308085250/http://tribune.ie/archive/article/2007/apr/29/beaumont-hospital-investigates-fake-email-warning- Beaumont Hospital investigates fake email warning of rape drug&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The most high profile person falling for the hoax was British MP [[Lynne Featherstone]], who asked a question about the fake drug in Parliament.

==Email contents==
Typical contents of the e-mail [[hoax]] are as follows, although different versions tend to turn up over time:
	
{{Blockquote|"A woman at a nightclub called _______ on Saturday night was taken by 5 men, who according to hospital and police reports, gang raped her before dumping her. Unable to remember the events of the evening, tests later confirmed the repeat rapes along with traces of [[Rohypnol]] in her blood and Progesterex, essentially a small sterilization pill. The drug is now being used by rapists at parties to rape AND sterilize their victims. Progesterex is available to vets to sterilize large animals. Progesterex is being used together with Rohypnol, the date rape drug. As with Rohypnol, all they have to do is drop it into the girl's drink. The girl can't remember a thing the next morning, of all that had taken place the night before. Progesterex, which dissolves in drinks just as easily, is such that the victim doesn't conceive from the rape and the rapist needn't worry about having a paternity test identifying him months later. The drug's effects ARE NOT TEMPORARY - Progesterex was designed to sterilize horses. Any female who takes it WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CONCEIVE. The weasels can get this drug from anyone who is in the vet school or any university. It's that easy, and Progesterex is about to break out big on campuses everywhere. Believe it or not, there are even sites on the Internet telling people how to use it. Please forward this to everyone you know, especially girls. Be careful when you're out and don't leave your drink unattended. Please make the effort to forward this on to all you know. Guys, please inform all your female friends and relatives."}}

==Debunking==
There is no "sterilization pill" under any name that exists for sterilizing horses. Sterilization of male horses is performed surgically, while mares are usually left unaltered

==Notable examples==
A version of this e-mail was translated and sent around in Brazil in 2008–2009.

A version of this hoax also made the rounds via bulletins on [[MySpace]], [[Bebo]], [[Facebook]], and [[Tagged]] and in the form of a group named "Heads Up Ladies".

According to the Spanish language website VSAntirus.com at least two versions in Spanish have made the rounds since 2001 as well.

On 18 April 2006 [[UK]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[Lynne Featherstone]] submitted a Written Question to the [[Home Secretary]] on whether the Home Office had calculated the number of [[date rape]] incidences that had been connected with Progesterex.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1282573/In-bath-thinking---Minister-warned-1am-tweets.html ¿In the bath thinking...¿: Minister warned over 1am tweets | Mail Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Home Office Minister [[Paul Goggins]] replied that "Progesterex does not exist".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2006-04-18c.63360.h&amp;s=Progesterex#g63360.q0 Date Rape: 18 Apr 2006: Written answers and statements (TheyWorkForYou.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lynnefeatherstone.org/2006/05/progesterex.htm Delivery, canvassing, stuffing… | Lynne Featherstone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827180051/http://www.lynnefeatherstone.org/2006/05/progesterex.htm |date=2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Featherstone criticised the government stating they "need to do more to discover the unearthly monster who sends them out" and that "their cavalier attitude will not do."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2006/05/02/exclusive-email-on-date-drug-is-a-hoax-115875-17018651/ Exclusive: Email On Date Drug Is A Hoax - Mirror.Co.Uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG7909143/Mad-Men-star-Christina-Hendricks-is-great-role-model-says-Equalities-Minister.html Mad Men star Christina Hendricks is great role model, says Equalities Minister - Telegraph&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics such as fellow Liberal Democrat James Graham castigated Featherstone's conduct in "criticising the Home Office for not having a response to made up drugs and made up crimes", stating "trivialising rape in this way without bothering to do basic research first doesn’t help anybody".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.theliberati.net/quaequamblog/2006/05/02/bombd/ Quaequam Blog! » Cook’d and Bomb’d&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many see the incident as having strong parallels with a previous case where MP [[David Amess]] asked a question in Parliament about a fictitious drug called "[[CAKE (drug)|Cake]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17354">The '''Red Bull Soapbox Race''' is a [[Gravity racer|soapbox]] race organised by the [[Red Bull GmbH|Red Bull]] company. First held in 2000, over a hundred races have been held in multiple countries around the world.

== History ==
The inaugural event was held in Brussels in 2000.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/15/red-bull-soapbox-races-re_n_3600757.html|title=PHOTOS: Soapbox Races Make An EPIC Comeback|last=Editor|first=Emily Thomas Associate|last2=News|first2=Huffington Post Weird|date=2013-07-15|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Races have since been held across the globe, from South Africa to Australia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It didn't arrive in the United States until 2006 (St. Louis), by which time 35 races had taken place.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/automobiles/21SOAP.html|title=Soapbox Derby - Red Bull|last=Hughes|first=C. J.|date=2007-10-21|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==
The vehicles must have steering and braking capability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Teams are judged on both the time taken to complete the course, as well as creativity of their design and the showmanship of a performance at the start of the race, meaning the team with the fastest time is not necessarily the winner.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/attractions/tally-ho-red-bull-soapbox-race-2015-headed-for-alexandra-palace-10242453.html|title=Tally ho! Red Bull Soapbox Race 2015 headed for Alexandra Palace|date=2015-05-12|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tracks ==
In the 2013 London race, one team reached a speed of over 50 kilometers per hour as they completed the 430 metre course in 33 seconds.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Cork 2004 course down St. Patrick's Hill was the steepest ever used at the time.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/soapbox-drivers-didn-t-need-any-stimulants-to-fly-without-wings-1.1145710|title=Soapbox drivers didn't need any stimulants to fly without wings|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable participants ==
In 2008, a team from Queen's University Belfast set the world speed record for soapbox racers at Stormont, Northern Ireland, at 45&amp;nbsp;mph, before entering the vehicle, Equmes 1, into the Red Bull race at Stormont later in the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SOAP+BOX+DERBY.-a0179356675|title=SOAP BOX DERBY. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7416548.stm|title=Students break soapbox record|date=2008-05-23|newspaper=BBC|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formula One driver Max Verstappen entered the 2015 Dutch race.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/32690427|title=Formula 1 gossip: Button, Maldonado, Grosjean, Hakkinen|website=BBC Sport|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prizes ==
The winners of events receive a trophy and various special prizes, such as a trip to the Macau Formula 3 Grand Prix to meet Carlos Sainz (Hong Kong 2012&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;), a tour of the Red Bull Racing Factory, including a high performance track day (London 2013&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;). In the 2007 Providence race, the three highest scoring teams received trips.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A People's Choice Award is given to the audience's favorite team.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Prize money is also awarded for the best charity entrant - 5,000 Euros for the 2004 Cork race.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Reception ==
In 2007, the New York Times contrasted the creative nature of the Red Bull series adult based teams, with the traditional American view of youth based Soap Box Derby, where design options were limited.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Reviewing the 2008 Belfast race, the [[The News Letter|''News Letter'']] related that it was "difficult to describe the quality of the lunacy on display"&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Reviewing the 2011 Los Angeles event, the ''Huffington Post'' described it as a piece of rare wholesome fun so rare in modern-day big cities, and through the various designs and teams it showed creativity and the human spirit, with flashes of great ingenuity and engineering, and capturing the [[zeitgeist]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Previewing the 2015 London event, the [[London Evening Standard|''Evening Standard'']] described the series as a global phenomena.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Reviewing the 2015 Monteal event, the ''Montreal Gazette'' said the races were not for the faint hearted, even for spectators.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The '''Rey de Reyes 2006''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "King of Kings") was the tenth annual [[Rey de Reyes]] [[professional wrestling]] tournament and show, produced by the Mexican [[wrestling promotion]] [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]]. The event took place on March 11, 2005 in the Convention Center in [[Ciudad Madero]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]. The main focus of the 2006 Rey de Reyes show was the tenth annual Rey de Reyes tournament which was contested as a multiman [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Elimination tag team matches|elimination match]] that saw four teams of three compete against each other until one man remained in the end. The teams were: Team AAA ([[La Parka II|La Parka]], [[Octagón]] and [[Vampiro]]), [[Secta De Mesias#La Secta Cibernetica|La Secta Cibernetica]] (Chessman, [[Cibernético]] and [[Muerte Cibernetica]]), [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|Team TNA]] ([[Konnan]], [[Ron Killings]] and [[Samoa Joe]]) and Los Guapos ([[Scorpio Jr.]], [[Shocker (wrestler)|Shocker]] and [[Zumbido]]). The undercard included a traditional [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|six man "Lucha Libre rules" tag team match]] between two of AAA’s [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stables]] in ''[[Los Diabolicos]]'' (Mr. Condor, Àngel Mortal and Gallego) and [[Real Fuerza Aérea]] ([[Laredo Kid]], Nemesis and [[Super Fly (wrestler)|Super Fly]]).

==Production==
===Background===
Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican ''[[Lucha Libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]], [[wrestling promotion|company]] [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] has held a [[Rey de Reyes]] (Spanish for "King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February,&lt;ref name="Rey1997"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#1997 | title = Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Rey de Reyes | accessdate = February 19, 2009 | date=February 21, 1997 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the [[eponym]]ious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's ''Rey''.&lt;ref name=YIR1997&gt;{{cite news|title=1997 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2332|date=January 7, 1998|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004&gt;{{cite news|title=Número Especial - Lo mejor de la lucha libre mexicana durante el 2004|work=SuperLuchas|id=Issue 91|date=January 24, 2005|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Four-man elimination match]] with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules.&lt;ref name="Rey1997"/&gt; There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004/&gt; The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the [[AAA Mega Championship]]. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual ''[[AAA Reina de Reinas Championship|Reina de Reinas]]'' ("Queen of Queens") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept.&lt;ref name=Reinas1999&gt;{{Cite book | author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter= Mexico: AAA Reina de Reinas | page= 400 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas12&gt;{{cite news | author = SuperLuchas staff | title = Lo Mejor de la Lucha Libre Mexicana 2008 | work =SuperLuchas | id = issue 296 | date =  January 6, 2008 | url=http://superluchas.net/?p=11145 | accessdate =  July 11, 2009| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas13&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2009/09/26/aaa-heroes-inmortales-homenaje-a-antonio-pena-resultados-en-vivo-26-septiembre-2009-%C2%BFque-pasara-con-la-lucha-entre-charly-manson-y-chessman-%C2%BFquien-sera-el-luchador-sorpresa/ | title= AAA- Héroes Inmortales III- (Resultados en vivo 26 septiembre 2009) – Cibernético gana el Trofeo Antonio Peña – Electroshock sustituye a Charly Manson contra Chessman – El luchador sorpresa fue Konan Big | author= Marquina, Alva | date= September 26, 2009 | accessdate= September 27, 2009 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 show was the tenthy Rey de Reyes show in the series.

===Storylines===
The Rey de Reyes show featured six [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16838">The '''Rikidozan Memorial Show''' was a [[professional wrestling]] event held in 1996, and again in 2000, as a tribute to "the father of [[puroresu]]," [[Rikidozan]] (also known as Mitsuhiro Momota). Both shows were considered major events in Japan and had involvement from virtually every major wrestling promotion at the time. The first show was held in [[Yokohama, Japan]] at the [[Yokohama Arena]] on June 30, 1996, with 16,000 in attendance.

On May 12, 2009, HBO announced that it was cancelling its sponsorship of Screen on the Green,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gYMFyhscnD--8pBOTyqRzUllTNGQD985DHEG5|title=Associated Press "HBO to end Screen on the Green movie series in DC", 12 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the future of the popular outdoor movie series was in doubt while another sponsor was sought.

Almost immediately, a [[Facebook]] fan group appeared, rallying a grassroots effort to save "Screen on the Green". Led by Jesse B Rauch, President and Founder of "Friends of Screen on the Green," over 2,500 Facebook users subscribed to the group. A massive e-mail campaign was launched to find new sponsors, and on June 10, 2009, [[Comcast]] and the Trust for the National Mall announced they would join forces with Time Warner's HBO to bring back Screen on the Green to the National Mall in the summer of 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2792">[[File:Roma Septimontium PNG.png|thumb|Map of the [[Seven hills of Rome]]]]
The '''Septimontium''' was a pre-urban [[Roman festival|festival]] celebrated in [[ancient Rome]] by ''montani'', residents of the seven ''(sept-)'' communities associated with the hills or peaks of Rome ''(montes)'': [[Oppius]], [[Palatine Hill|Palatium]], [[Velian Hill|Velia]], [[Fagutal]], Cermalus, [[Caelian Hill|Caelius]], and [[Cispius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Philology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SalJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA71|year=1906|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=71–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Septimontium was celebrated in September, or, according to later calendars, on [[Agonalia|11 December]]. It was not a public festival in the sense of ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|feriae]] populi'', according to [[Varro]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 6.24.&lt;/ref&gt; who sees it as an urban analog to the rural [[Paganalia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E.A. Palmer]], ''The Archaic Community of the Romans'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009), pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fulminante2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francesca Fulminante|title=The Urbanisation of Rome and Latium Vetus: From the Bronze Age to the Archaic Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XE5kAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75|date=10 February 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-03035-0|pages=75–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The etymology from ''septem'' ("seven") has been doubted; the festival may instead take its name from ''saept-'', "divided," in the sense of "partitioned off, [[wikt:palisade|palisaded]]."&lt;ref&gt;Kurt A. Raaflaub, "Between Myth and History: Rome's Rise from Village to Empire (the Eighth Century to 264)," in ''A Companion to the Roman Republic'' (Blackwell, 2010), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''montes'' include two divisions of the [[Palatine Hill]] and three of the [[Esquiline Hill]], among the traditional "[[seven hills of Rome]]".&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Venning, ''A Chronology of the Roman Empire'' (Continuum, 2011), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]]'s notice of this festival is obscure, and confuses the nature of the Septimontium as represented by inscriptions and [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] with the proverbial seven hills of Rome. At this time, he notes, Romans refrained from operating horse-drawn vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Roman Questions'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/C.html#69 69.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators allege that 180.6 billion euros passed through HSBC accounts held in Geneva by over 100,000 clients and 20,000 [[Offshore company|offshore companies]] between November 2006 and March 2007. The data for this period comes from files removed from HSBC Private Bank by a former staffer, [[software engineer]] [[Hervé Falciani]],&lt;ref name="monde"/&gt; who fled to Lebanon with the attempt to sell it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lenews.ch/2018/04/11/swissleaks-author-arrested-in-spain-on-switzerlands-request/|title="Swissleaks" author arrested in Spain at Switzerland’s request|date=2018-04-11|work=Le News|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he handed it to French authorities in late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icij.org/project/swiss-leaks/whistleblower-thief-hero-introducing-source-data-shook-hsbc|title=Whistleblower?

=== Investigation in France ===
The case was referred to French prosecutors in January 2009, and they have since concentrated their investigations on a small part of the “Falciani lists” – the around 3'000 French citizens suspected of having concealed their money at [[HSBC Private Bank#HSBC Private Bank .28Suisse.29|HSBC Private Bank (Suisse)]] with the bank's collusion. The bank has de facto been placed under formal investigation as a legal entity for “illicit selling of banking and financial services” and “money laundering of the proceeds of tax evasion”.

HSBC PB is said to have concealed over €5.7 billion in tax havens for its French clients alone. The French Finance Ministry took 72 individuals to court (including [[Nina Ricci (designer)|Nina Ricci]]’s heir, Arlette Ricci),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/13/nina-ricci-heir-convicted-of-tax-evasion-in-france-with-help-of-hsbc|title=Nina Ricci heir convicted of tax evasion in France with help of HSBC|last=Willsher|first=Kim|date=2015-04-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; as most of the French taxpayers whose identity was revealed in the Falciani lists have since regularised their tax affairs.

[[Le Monde]] has been investigating the HSBC affair since the outset, and in early 2014 came into possession of international banking data including all the files the French tax authorities had extracted from the Falciani lists in the strictest secrecy since 2009, sometimes ignoring government reservations.The bank's account managers illegally contacted many of these people in France. They were all encouraged by [[HSBC Private Bank#HSBC Private Bank .28Suisse.29|HSBC Private Bank (Suisse)]]'s executive committee to hide their money behind offshore screen structures, generally based in Panama or the British Virgin Islands, in order to avoid certain European taxes, chiefly the EU Savings DirectiveI

===Investigation in Morocco===

According to the International Consortium of Investigation Journalists ( [[ICIJ]] ), which treated the data of the Swiss Leaks, [[Morocco]] is concerned by $1.6 billion of tax evasion and stands at thirty-seventh place of the affected countries. Morocco stands at the 23rd place for the amount of client ( 1068 ). The maximal amount of tax evasion for one client was $74.1 billion and the average was $1.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://projects.icij.org/swiss-leaks/countries/rankings#money&lt;/ref&gt;
As stated in the Moroccan law, it is strictly forbidden to have a foreign bank account. But the documents revealed that the royal family were part of the HSBC clients. [[Prince Moulay Rachid]] was touched by this scandal, the princess [[Lalla Meryem]] and the current king [[Mohammed VI]] with an amount $9.1 billions hidden in the HSBC bank.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/evasion-fiscale/article/2015/02/08/swissleaks-sa-majeste-mohammed-vi-client-numero-5090190103-chez-hsbc_4572324_4862750.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/evasion-fiscale/article/2015/02/13/plongee-dans-les-noms-marocains-de-swissleaks_4575995_4862750.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Investigation ===
Given the scale of the investigation, [[Le Monde]] called upon 154 journalists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/evasion-fiscale/article/2015/02/08/swissleaks-the-backstory-of-a-worldwide-investigation_4572334_4862750.html|title=" SwissLeaks " : the backstory of a worldwide investigation|website=Le Monde.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; affiliated with 47 different media outlets including: [[The Guardian]], [[CBS]], [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]], and [[The Indian Express]], among others, to help analyze the data. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists ([[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists|ICIJ]]) has been coordinating this international collaborative effort.

In February 2015, the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] (ICIJ) website released information about bank accounts in [[Switzerland]] under the title ''Swiss Leaks: Murky Cash Sheltered by Bank Secrecy,''&lt;ref name="icij"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icij.org/project/swiss-leaks|title=Swiss Leaks: Murky Cash Sheltered by Bank Secrecy|work=International Consortium of Investigative Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; which involves the ''Swiss Leaks Project'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://projects.icij.org/swiss-leaks/|title=Swiss Leaks|website=projects.icij.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; a website containing almost 60,000 leaked files that provide details on over 100,000 HSBC clients and their bank accounts.

=== Involvement ===
The ''Swiss Leaks Project's&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'' investigations revealed that HSBC's Geneva branch, ignoring these rules, helped people accused of drug-running, corruption, money-laundering or arms-dealing conceal billions of dollars in Switzerland.

Among the names revealed by the Swiss Leaks investigation are:

* [[Rami Makhlouf]], whose cousin and close associate, Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad|Bashar al Assad]], over the past three years has helped cause the deaths of tens of thousands of his citizens in the country's civil war.
* [[Mining industry of Guinea|Katex Mines Guinee]], a company fingered by the United Nations as a “possible provider of weapons” in Liberia's civil war.
* Erez Daleyot, a Belgian-Israeli diamond tycoon, connected to arms trafficking, [[blood diamond]]s and bribery.
* [[Jeffrey Tessler|Jeffrey Tesler]], a lawyer and key participant in the $182-million [[Halliburton]] Bribery Scandal;.
* [[Rachid Mohamed Rachid]], the former Egyptian trade minister who fled Cairo in February 2011 amid the uprising against [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Rachid was convicted in absentia for alleged profiteering and squandering public funds.
* Vladimir Antonov, a Russian banker accused of looting £400m from the Lithuanian [[Snoras|Snoras bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://projects.icij.org/swiss-leaks/people/|title=People — Swiss Leaks|website=projects.icij.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HSBC Trial ===
In March 2015, the French financial state prosecutor has requested that HSBC's Swiss private bank be sent to criminal trial over the suspected tax-dodging scheme for wealthy customers. The recommendation follows a lengthy investigation by local magistrates into alleged tax fraud involving 3,000 French taxpayers and is a procedural step that brings the Swiss banking arm one step closer to a possible trial in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/13/hsbc-swiss-private-bank-criminal-trial-request-france|title=HSBC's Swiss private bank: French prosecutor formally requests trial|last=Chrisafis|first=Angelique|last2=Farrell|first2=Sean|date=2015-03-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, [[HSBC Private Bank|HSBC]] has agreed to pay 300 million euros ($352 million) to avoid going to trial in France for enabling tax fraud. The deal struck between the financial crime prosecutor's office and the bank is a first in France under a new procedure that allows companies under suspicion of corruption or dissimulation of tax fraud to negotiate a fine to stop a case from going to trial.

French prosecutors have now dropped the case against [[HSBC|HSBC Holdings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.fr/20171114/hsbc-to-pay-300-mn-euros-to-france-to-avoid-tax-fraud-trial|title=HSBC to pay France €300million to avoid tax fraud trial|date=2017-11-14|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Playbillgeorge.jpeg|thumb|right|Poster for National Theatre production on tour]]
'''''The Madness of George III''''' is a 1991 [[Play (theatre)|play]] by [[Alan Bennett]]. It is a fictionalised [[biography|biographical]] study of the latter half of the reign of [[George III of the United Kingdom]], his battle with [[mental illness]], and the inability of his court to handle his condition. It was adapted for film in 1994 as ''[[The Madness of King George]]''.

==Performance history==
The play had its premiere on 28 November 1991 at the Lyttelton Theatre of the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in [[London]]. It was directed by [[Nicholas Hytner]] and designed by  Mark Thompson. The play starred [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], Janet Dale as [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]] and Michael Fitzgerald as the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], also starring [[Julian Wadham]], [[Charles Kay]], [[Adrian Scarborough]], Mark Lockyer and David Henry.

After its London run, the production toured the UK and the United States, returned to the National Theatre in 1993 and was then presented in [[Athens]] and Israel in 1994.

The play was staged at the [[Old Globe Theatre|Lowell Davies Festival Theatre]] in [[San Diego, California]], June 19 - September 24, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theoldglobe.org/tickets/production.aspx?performanceNumber=7936|title=The Old Globe Website|date=|accessdate=2010-08-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310073558/http://theoldglobe.org/tickets/production.aspx?performanceNumber=7936|archivedate=2012-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January 2012, the play was revived at the [[Apollo Theatre]]. [[David Haig]] played George III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimaxtheatres.com/apollo-theatre/|title=Apollo Theatre, London - Official Box Office - Nimax Theatres|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further revival took place in November 2018, at Nottingham Playhouse, with [[Mark Gatiss]] as the lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nottinghamplayhouse.co.uk/whats-on/drama/the-madness-of-george-iii/|title=The Madness of George III|website=Nottingham Playhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
The play has been viewed as a character study for the actor who plays George III and most reviewers attribute its success to compelling performances from the two actors, Hawthorne and Haig, who played the king. [[Frank Rich]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' singled out Nigel Hawthorne's performance in the US tour, calling it "astonishing" and "unforgettable", though he labelled the play itself as not "one of Bennett's major works" and as being more "marketable to Broadway and the colonies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/17/theater/review-theater-the-madness-of-george-iii-creating-a-lovable-george-iii.html|title=Review/Theater: The Madness of George III; Creating a Lovable George III|first=Frank|last=Rich|date=17 September 1993|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about the 2012 revival, Lyn Gardner said that Luscombe's production reminds us that "Bennett is not writing a royal Downton Abbey, but a play exploring appearance and reality", and that the play brings out the fact that amidst all the royal pomp the king is merely a man like everybody else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/24/madness-of-george-iii-review|title=The Madness of George III – review|first=Lyn|last=Gardner|date=24 January 2012|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Telegraph'', Charles Spencer praised Haig's performance, comparing it favorably to Hawthorne's performance twenty years earlier, saying "it seemed an impossible act to follow, but David Haig proves every inch Hawthorne’s equal in a performance of extraordinary emotion, tenderness and humour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/9036274/The-Madness-of-George-III-Apollo-Theatre-review.html|title=The Madness of George III, Apollo Theatre, review|first=Charles|last=Spencer|date=24 February 2018|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The letter of the eight''' was signed on 30 January 2003, by the prime ministers for five of then fifteen members of the [[European Union]] in addition to three high representatives for the [[Central Europe]]an countries that were to [[Enlargement of the European Union|enter the union in 2004]]. It expressed indirect support for [[United States]] ambition of a régime change in [[Iraq]] in the lead-up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. To most observers{{who|date=April 2016}} it demonstrated a total division within the EU in respect to [[foreign policy]] and attitudes towards [[international law]]. 

The letter, from the governments of [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]], accused [[Saddam Hussein]] of continuing to develop [[weapons of mass destruction]] and urged the [[UN Security Council]] to act against that threat. The statement's content was not controversial, as it said that Saddam Hussein should not be allowed to violate UN resolutions, but the exclusion of ten of EU's 15 members was interpreted as a signal of deep division and the difficulty of implementing the EU's [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]].

The letter was on 6 February followed by the [[Vilnius letter]], a more outspoken declaration of support for the position of the United States from the [[Vilnius group]] composed of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]],  [[Albania]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Romania]], and a member of the [[UN Security Council]], [[Bulgaria]].

[[File:Truthiness.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Stephen Colbert]] uses "truthiness" on the debut episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'']]

'''Truthiness''' is the belief or assertion that a particular statement is true based on the [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] or perceptions of some individual or individuals, without regard to [[evidence]], [[logic]], [[Intelligence|intellectual]] examination, or [[fact]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/12/opinion/meyer/main2250923.shtml |title=The Truth of Truthiness |first=Dick |last=Meyer |publisher=CBS News |date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=December 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Truthiness | website=Dictionary.com Unabridged | publisher=Random House | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/truthiness | accessdate=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truthiness can range from ignorant assertions of falsehoods to deliberate duplicity or propaganda intended to sway opinions.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Roth, p. 5"&gt;{{cite book | title=Truthiness Fever | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRIE3PGf-1YC | author=Hayes-Roth, Rick | publisher=BookLocker.com, Inc. | year=2015 | page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wPMCwAAQBA | title=Rethinking Psychology: Good Science, Bad Science, Pseudoscience | author=Hughes, Brian | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | year=2016 | page=35 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of truthiness has emerged as a major subject of discussion surrounding [[Politics of the United States|U.S. politics]] during the 1990s and 2000s because of the perception among some observers of a rise in propaganda and a growing hostility toward factual reporting and fact-based discussion.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Roth, p. 5"/&gt;

American television comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] coined the term ''truthiness'' in this meaning&lt;ref name="zimmer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002586.html |last=Zimmer |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Zimmer |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Language Log: Truthiness or Trustiness?}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the subject of a segment called "[[Recurring segments on The Colbert Report#The Wørd|The Wørd]]" during the pilot episode of his political satire program ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on October 17, 2005. By using this as part of his routine, Colbert satirized the misuse of [[appeal to emotion]] and "gut feeling" as a rhetorical device in contemporaneous socio-political discourse.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/stephen-colbert-13970 |title=Interview: Stephen Colbert |first=Nathan |last=Rabin |publisher=A.V.

Bush]]'s [[Harriet Miers Supreme Court nomination|nomination]] of [[Harriet Miers]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and the [[Rationale for the Iraq War|decision to invade Iraq]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="word"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/63ite2/the-colbert-report-the-word---truthiness |date=October 17, 2005 |accessdate=November 7, 2018 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos: The Word (Truthiness)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert later ascribed truthiness to other institutions and organizations, including [[Wikiality|Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/motherload/index.jhtml?ml_video=72347 |title=The Colbert Report / Comedy Central recording of The WØRD "Wikiality" |work=[[Comedy Central]] |date=July 31, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308053730/http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=72347 |archivedate=March 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert has sometimes used a [[Dog Latin]] version of the term, "Veritasiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://firedoglake.com/2006/06/05/a-stop-on-the-veritasiness-tour-2006/ |accessdate=September 3, 2010 |date=June 5, 2006 |title=A Stop on the Veritasiness Tour 2006 |work=Firedoglake |first=Christy Hardin |last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Colbert's "Operation Iraqi Stephen: Going Commando" the word "Veritasiness" can be seen on the banner above the eagle on the operation's seal.

''[[wikt:truthiness|Truthiness]]'' was named [[Word of the Year]] for 2005 by the [[American Dialect Society]] and for 2006 by [[Merriam-Webster]].&lt;ref name="dialectsoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americandialect.org/Words_of_the_Year_2005.pdf |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Truthiness Voted 2005 Word of the Year by American Dialect Society |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/06words.htm |title=Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year 2006 |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=December 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist and ''OED'' consultant [[Benjamin Zimmer]]&lt;ref name="zimmer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~bgzimmer/ |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Benjamin Zimmer homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the word ''truthiness''&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11182033/site/newsweek/ |title=The Truthiness Teller |first=Marc |last=Peyser |journal=Newsweek |issn=0028-9604 |date=February 13, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425101629/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11182033/site/newsweek/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; already had a history in literature and appears in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED''), as a derivation of ''[[:wikt:truthy|truthy]]'', and ''[[The Century Dictionary]]'', both of which indicate it as rare or dialectal, and to be defined more straightforwardly as "truthfulness, faithfulness".&lt;ref name="zimmer" /&gt; Responding to claims by Michael Adams that the word already existed with a different meaning, Colbert said, "Truthiness is a word I pulled right out of my [[wikt:keister|keister]]".&lt;ref name=Kiser /&gt;

==Use by Stephen Colbert==
[[Stephen Colbert]], portraying his character [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Dr. Stephen T. Colbert]], chose the word ''truthiness'' just moments before taping the premiere episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on October 17, 2005, after deciding that the originally scripted word – "truth" – was not absolutely ridiculous enough: "We're not talking about truth, we're talking about something that seems like truth – the truth we want to exist", he explained.&lt;ref name="nymag"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://nymag.com/news/politics/22322/index1.html |title=Stephen Colbert Has America by the Ballots |first=Adam |last=Sternbergh |journal=New York Magazine |issn=0362-4331 |date=October 16, 2006 |accessdate=October 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ColbertWriters"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvnHf3MQtAk&amp;t=1m |title=Colbert Report Writers – The Truthiness Behind The Lines, Truthiness and Pun Journals |publisher=The Paley Center, YouTube channel |date=November 7, 2009 |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced his definition in the first segment of the episode, saying: "Now I'm sure some of the 'word police', the 'wordinistas' over at [[Merriam-Webster|Webster's]] are gonna say, 'Hey, that's not a word'. Well, anybody who knows me knows I'm no fan of dictionaries or reference books. They're elitist. Constantly telling us what is or isn't true. Or what did or didn't happen."&lt;ref name="word" /&gt;

When asked in an [[Breaking character|out-of-]][[Stephen Colbert (character)|character]] interview with ''[[The Onion]]'''s [[The A.V. Club|A.V. Club]] for his views on "the 'truthiness' imbroglio that's tearing our country apart", Colbert elaborated on the critique he intended to convey with the word:&lt;ref name="avclub" /&gt;

{{quote|Truthiness is tearing apart our country, and I don't mean the argument over who came up with the word ...

It used to be, everyone was entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts. But that's not the case anymore. Facts matter not at all. Perception is everything. It's certainty. People love the President [George W. Bush] because he's certain of his choices as a leader, even if the facts that back him up don't seem to exist. It's the fact that he's certain that is very appealing to a certain section of the country. I really feel a dichotomy in the American populace. What is important? What you want to be true, or what is true?...

Truthiness is 'What I say is right, and [nothing] anyone else says could possibly be true.' It's not only that I ''feel'' it to be true, but that ''I'' feel it to be true. There's not only an emotional quality, but there's a selfish quality.}}

During an interview on December 8, 2006, with [[Charlie Rose]],&lt;ref name="Charlie Rose"&gt;Charlie Rose (December 8, 2006), [http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2006/12/08/2/a-conversation-with-comedian-stephen-colbert "A conversation with comedian Stephen Colbert"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915040747/http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2006/12/08/2/a-conversation-with-comedian-stephen-colbert |date=September 15, 2008 }}. Retrieved on August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert stated:

{{quote|I was thinking of the idea of passion and emotion and certainty over information. And what you feel in your gut, as I said in the first Wørd we did, which was sort of a thesis statement of the whole show – however long it lasts – is that sentence, that one word, that's more important to, I think, the public at large, and not just the people who provide it in prime-time cable, than information.}}

On his April 2, 2009 episode of ''The Colbert Report'', Colbert added an addendum to the definition: a word so straight that it drives men wild.

==Coverage by news media==
After Colbert's introduction of truthiness, it quickly became widely used and recognized. Six days after, [[CNN]]'s ''[[Reliable Sources]]'' featured a discussion of ''The Colbert Report'' by host [[Howard Kurtz]], who played a clip of Colbert's definition.&lt;ref&gt;It was also used September 23, 2008 by CNN's American Morning by John Roberts.

Me. Stephen Colbert. But I'm not surprised. ''Nightline'''s on opposite me..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iseeseveralflaws.com/dirt/archives/000426.html |title=[D1RT]: stephen colbert on... |accessdate=September 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224145226/http://www.iseeseveralflaws.com/dirt/archives/000426.html |archivedate=December 24, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few months of its introduction by Colbert, truthiness was discussed in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[USA Weekly]]'', the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[CNN]], [[MSNBC]], [[Fox News]], the [[Associated Press]], ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'', ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'', ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', [[CNET]], and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'', [[CBS]]'s ''[[60 Minutes]]'', and ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.

The February 13, 2006 issue of ''Newsweek'' featured an article on ''The Colbert Report'' titled "The Truthiness Teller", recounting the career of the word ''truthiness'' since its popularization by Colbert.&lt;ref name="newsweek" /&gt;

===''The New York Times'' coverage and usage===
In its issue of October 25, 2005, eight days after the premiere episode of the ''Report'', ''The New York Times'' ran its third article on ''The Colbert Report'', "Bringing Out the Absurdity of the News".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/25/arts/television/25watc.html&lt;!--http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A16F83B5B0C768EDDA90994DD404482--&gt; |title=Bringing Out the Absurdity of the News |first=Allesandra |last=Stanley |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=October 25, 2005 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article specifically discussed the segment on "truthiness", although the ''Times'' misreported the word as "trustiness". In its November 1, 2005 issue, the ''Times'' ran a correction. On the next episode of the ''Report'', Colbert took the ''Times'' to task for the error, pointing out, ironically, that "trustiness" is "not even a word".&lt;ref&gt;Many dictionaries (e.g. [http://www.bartleby.com/61/32/T0393200.html American Heritage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010192553/http://www.bartleby.com/61/32/T0393200.html |date=October 10, 2006 }}, [http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=trustiness Merriam-Webster], New Oxford Dictionary of English, etc.) offer definitions for ''trustiness''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' again discussed "truthiness" in its issue of December 25, 2005, this time as one of nine words that had captured the year's [[zeitgeist]], in an article titled "2005: In a Word; Truthiness" by Jacques Steinberg. In crediting ''truthiness'', Steinberg said, "the [[pundit (politics)|pundit]] who probably drew the most attention in 2005 was only playing one on TV: Stephen Colbert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/weekinreview/25track.ready.html?ei=5090&amp;en=0ad1e6ef6392c7da&amp;ex=1293166800&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1137484544-pMx4vqbEIRjCInvXH5mFzg |title=2005: In a Word: Truthiness |first=Jacques |last=Steinberg |authorlink=Jacques Steinberg |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=December 25, 2005 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the January 22, 2006 issue, columnist [[Frank Rich]] used the term seven times, with credit to Colbert, in a column titled "Truthiness 101: From Frey to Alito",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/22/opinion/truthiness-101-from-frey-to-alito.html |title=Truthiness 101: From Frey to Alito |first=Frank |last=Rich |authorlink=Frank Rich |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=January 22, 2006 |accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss Republican portrayals of several issues (including the [[Samuel Alito]] nomination, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s response to [[Hurricane Katrina]], and [[Jack Murtha]]'s [[Vietnam War]] record). Rich emphasized the extent to which the word had quickly become a cultural fixture, writing, "The mock Comedy Central pundit Stephen Colbert's slinging of the word 'truthiness' caught on instantaneously last year precisely because we live in the age of truthiness." ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'' reported on Rich's use of "truthiness" in his column, saying he "tackled the growing trend to 'truthiness,' as opposed to truth, in the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/PrintArticle/-NY-Times-Frank-Rich-Taking-Book-Leave |title='NY Times' Frank Rich Taking Book Leave |author=Strupp, Joe |date=January 22, 2006 |accessdate=January 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' published two letters on the 2006 [[White House]] [[White House Correspondents' Association|Correspondents' Dinner]], where [[Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner|Stephen Colbert was the featured guest]], in its May 3, 2006 edition, under the headline "Truthiness and Power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/opinion/l03colbert.html?ex=1149652800&amp;en=be69d253b7aa626d&amp;ei=5070 |title=Truthiness and Power |last1=Howard |first1=Gloria D. |last2=Phillian |first2=William M. |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=May 3, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Rich referenced truthiness again in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2008, describing the strategy of [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|John McCain's presidential campaign]] as being "to envelop the entire presidential race in a thick fog of truthiness",&lt;ref name="Rich '08"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/opinion/21rich.html |title=Truthiness Stages a Comeback |last=Rich |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Rich |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=September 21, 2008 |accessdate=September 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich explained that the campaign was based on truthiness because "McCain, [[Sarah Palin]] and their surrogates keep repeating the same lies over and over not just to smear their opponents and not just to mask their own record. Their larger aim is to construct a bogus alternative reality so relentless it can overwhelm any haphazard journalistic stabs at puncturing it."&lt;ref name="Rich '08" /&gt; Rich also noted, "You know the press is impotent at unmasking this truthiness when the hardest-hitting interrogation McCain has yet faced on television came on '' '[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'.'' [[Barbara Walters]] and [[Joy Behar]] called him on several falsehoods, including his endlessly repeated [[Sarah Palin#Federal funding|fantasy that Palin opposed earmarks]] for Alaska. Behar used the word 'lies' to his face."&lt;ref name="Rich '08" /&gt;

==Widespread recognition==

Usage of "truthiness" continued to proliferate in media, politics, and public consciousness. On January 5, 2006, [[etymology]] professor [[Anatoly Liberman]] began an hour-long program on [[public radio]] by discussing truthiness and predicting that it would be included in dictionaries in the next year or two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/programs/midmorning/listings/mm20060102.shtml |date=January 5, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Where Words Come From}}&lt;/ref&gt; His prediction seemed to be on track when, the next day, the [[American Dialect Society]] announced that "truthiness" was its 2005 Word of the Year, and the website of the ''Macmillan English Dictionary'' featured ''truthiness'' as its Word of the Week a few weeks later.&lt;ref name="mac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/New-Words/060213-truthiness.htm |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Word of the Week Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323074132/http://www.macmillandictionary.com/New-Words/060213-truthiness.htm &lt;!--http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A16F83B5B0C768EDDA90994DD404482--&gt; |archivedate=March 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Truthiness'' was also selected by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as one of nine words that captured the spirit of 2005. [[Global Language Monitor]],&lt;ref&gt;
|url=http://www.languagemonitor.com&lt;/ref&gt; which tracks trends in languages, named ''truthiness'' the top television buzzword of 2006, and another term Colbert coined with reference to truthiness, ''[[Wikipedia in culture#Wikiality|wikiality]]'', as another of the top ten television buzzwords of 2006, the first time two words from the same show have made the list.

The word was listed in the annual "[[Banished Word List]]" released by a committee at [[Lake Superior State University]] in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]] in 2007. The list included "truthiness" among other overused terms, such as "awesome" celebrity couple [[portmanteau]]s such as "[[Brangelina]]", and "[[pwn]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lssu.edu/banished/archive/2007.php Lake Superior State University 2007 List of Banished Words] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919133033/http://www.lssu.edu/banished/archive/2007.php |date=September 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, on January 8, 2007 Colbert stated that Lake Superior State University was an "[[attention-seeking]] second-tier state university".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=720 Colbert Report Episode 3001 (1/8/2006) overview]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 List of Banished Words restored "truthiness" to formal usage, in response to the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lssu.edu/banished/archive/2008.php Lake Superior State University 2008 List of Banished Words] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017001524/http://lssu.edu/banished/archive/2008.php |date=October 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Dialect Society's Word of the Year===
On January 6, 2006, the [[American Dialect Society]] announced that "truthiness" was selected as its 2005 [[Word of the Year (American Dialect Society)|Word of the Year]]. The Society described its rationale as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In its 16th annual words of the year vote, the American Dialect Society voted ''truthiness'' as the word of the year. First heard on ''The Colbert Report'', a satirical mock news show on the Comedy Central television channel, ''truthiness'' refers to the quality of preferring concepts or facts one wishes or believes to be true, rather than concepts or facts known to be true. As Stephen Colbert put it, "I don't trust books. They're all fact, no heart."&lt;ref name="dialectsoc" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Merriam-Webster's Word of the Year===
On December 10, 2006 the [[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] announced that "truthiness" was selected as its 2006 Word of the Year on [[Lists of Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year|Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year]], based on a reader poll, by a 5–1 margin over the second-place word ''[[Google (verb)|google]]''.&lt;ref name="mw" /&gt; "We're at a point where what constitutes truth is a question on a lot of people's minds, and truth has become up for grabs", said Merriam-Webster president John Morse. {{"'}}Truthiness' is a playful way for us to think about a very important issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/chronicle/4389349.html |title=Colbert's 'truthiness' pronounced Word of the Year |first=Adam |last=Gorlick |publisher=AP/Houston Chronicle |date=December 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite winning Word of the Year, the word does not appear in the 2006 edition of the Merriam-Webster English Dictionary. In response to this omission, during "The Wørd" segment on December 12, 2006 Colbert issued a new page 1344 for the tenth edition of the Merriam Webster dictionary that featured "truthiness". To make room for the definition of "truthiness", including a portrait of Colbert, the definition for the word "try" was removed with Colbert stating "Sorry, try. Maybe you should have tried harder." He also sarcastically told viewers to "not" download the new page and "not" glue it in the new dictionary in libraries and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/182467/december-12-2006/who-s-honoring-me-now----merriam-webster-s-word-of-the-year |title=Who's Honoring Me Now? – Merriam-Webster's Word of the Year |first=Stephen |last=Colbert |publisher=Colbert Nation |date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The New York Times'' crossword puzzle ===
In the June 14, 2008 edition of ''The New York Times'', the word was featured as 1-across in the [[The New York Times crossword puzzle|crossword puzzle]]. Colbert mentioned this during the last segment on the June 18 episode of ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', and declared himself the "King of the Crossword".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=174004&amp;title=daily/colbert-crossword-puzzle |title=Daily/Colbert – Crossword Puzzle |date=June 18, 2008 |work=Comedy Central |format=video |accessdate=December 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rexwordpuzzle.blogspot.com/2008/06/saturday-jun-14-2008-brendan-emmett.html |work=Rex Parker does the NYT crossword puzzle (personal blog) |title=Saturday, Jun . 14, 2008 |first=Rex |last=Parker |date=June 14, 2008 |accessdate=June 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BBC "portrait of the decade" ===
In December 2009, the [[BBC]] online magazine asked its readers to nominate suggestions of things to be included on a poster which would represent important events in the 2000s (decade), divided into five different categories: "People", "Words", "News", "Objects" and "Culture". Suggestions were sent in and a panel of five independent experts shortened each category to what they saw as the 20 most important. Among the nominations selected in the "Words" category was "Truthiness". As a result, the word "Truthiness" appeared in the poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8406898.stm |title=A portrait of the decade |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=December 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
In 2012, a study examining truthiness was carried out by PhD student Eryn Newman of [[Victoria University of Wellington]]. The experiments showed that people are more likely to believe that a claim is true regardless of evidence when a decorative photograph appears alongside it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Pictures-aid-truthiness-study-reveals/tabid/1160/articleID/265386/Default.aspx |title=Pictures aid 'truthiness', study reveals |first=Dan |last=Satherley |publisher=[[3 News]] |date=August 14, 2012 |accessdate=August 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212053537/http://www.3news.co.nz/Pictures-aid-truthiness-study-reveals/tabid/1160/articleID/265386/Default.aspx |archive-date=February 12, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.springer.com/about+springer/media/springer+select?SGWID=0-11001-6-1385843-0 |title=Scientists discover the truth behind Colbert's "truthiness" |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kitty Genovese case retrospective===

As noted by Jesse Singal in an April 5, 2016 piece "How the False Story of Kitty Genovese’s Murder Went Viral" in [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] upon the death of [[Murder of Kitty Genovese|Kitty Genovese]]'s murderer, the entire escalation of a myth surrounding the murder, alleging that 38 people had been silent witnesses allowing a vicious death to proceed in front of them, was attributable to the myth's appeal to "truthiness" (grounded in fear – of insecurity and lack of community spirit) over full investigation into actual truth:

"Today, of course, there is exponentially more news coverage than there was in 1964 — not to mention exponentially more attempts to slot attention-getting events into simple, truthy stories about human nature. The gap between the famous version of the Genovese story and the true one, then, is worth remembering, if only as a check on our natural tendency to hear a story and then nod along and say, 'Of course that’s what happened!'”&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/04/how-the-false-story-of-kitty-genovese-s-murder-went-viral.html?om_rid=AAWrdT&amp;om_mid=_BXBAs3B9MJ$ivU "How the False Story of Kitty Genovese’s Murder Went Viral"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Frey controversy===
The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' published an editorial in its January 16, 2006 issue titled "The Truthiness Hurts", crediting the rise of ''truthiness'' as serendipitously providing an apt description of the [[Oprah Book Club]] controversy over [[James Frey]]'s fictionalized "memoir", ''[[A Million Little Pieces]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0601160188jan16,1,4983997.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060125010138/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0601160188jan16,1,4983997.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 25, 2006 |title=The Truthiness Hurts |author=Chicago Tribune editorial board |newspaper=The Chicago Tribune |issn=1085-6706 |date=January 16, 2006 |accessdate=February 1, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- see contemporaneous access at http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Truthiness&amp;diff=37600469&amp;oldid=37592567 --&gt; ''Truthiness'' was also used to describe the controversy over the factual accuracy of Frey's book by ''[[USA Today]]'' in its January 15, 2006 issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2006-01-15-truth-debate_x.htm |title=Truth falls to "Pieces" after suspect memoir |first=Marco R. |last=Della Cava |newspaper=USA Today |issn=0734-7456 |date=January 15, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; by several other publications including ''[[The New York Times]],'' and by the television news program ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' on its October 23 and January 26 editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=FA0B12F7395B0C718EDDA80894DE404482 |title=Truthiness 101: From Frey to Alito |first=Frank |last=Rich |authorlink=Frank Rich |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=January 22, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oprah Winfrey]] also discussed ''truthiness'' with [[Frank Rich]] on her show, in reference to the Frey controversy and the column "Truthiness 101" Rich had recently published in ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200601/20060126/slide_20060126_350_204.jhtml |date=January 26, 2006 |title=The Oprah Winfrey Show (transcript) |archivedate=April 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401154709/http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200601/20060126/slide_20060126_350_204.jhtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also mentioned Colbert's role in making the word "truthiness".&lt;ref name="carr"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/business/media/30carr.html |title=How Oprahness Trumped Truthiness |first=David |last=Carr |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |date=January 30, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, [[MSNBC]] ran a commentary titled "Oprah strikes a blow for truthiness: Do facts really matter? Ask Winfrey, James Frey or Stephen Colbert", making the case that Winfrey's about-face on Frey's book was a "small (and belated) but bold nudge back out of the proud halls of truthiness", but also opportunistic and too little too late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/11044071/ |title=Oprah strikes a blow for truthiness |first=Jon |last=Bonné |publisher=MSNBC |date=January 27, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Canadian Parliament===
In 2006, [[Liberal Party of Canada]] leadership contender [[Ken Dryden]] used truthiness as an extensive theme in a speech in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. The speech dealt critically with the [[28th Canadian Ministry|Harper]] government's [[Universal Child Care Plan]].&lt;ref name="hansard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1&amp;DocId=2179089#Int-1515982 |date=May 4, 2006 |accessdate=October 16, 2007 |title=''Hansard''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dryden defined truthiness as "something that is spoken as if true that one wants others to believe is true, that said often enough with enough voices orchestrated in behind it, might even sound true, but is not true."

The transcript of all debates in the House ([[Hansard]]) is made available in both official languages; the translators into French chose to render "truthiness" as ''fausse vérité'' ("false truth").&lt;ref name="hansard" /&gt;

===Alleged snubbing by the Associated Press, and Colbert's response===
The [[Associated Press]] reported on the American Dialect Society's selection of truthiness as the Word of the Year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002725801_words07.html |title=Honestly, "truthiness" is selected the word of 2005 |last=Clark |first=Heather |newspaper=The Seattle Times |agency=Associated Press |date=January 1, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528050238/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002725801_words07.html |archivedate=May 28, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the following comments by one of the voting linguists:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Michael Adams, a professor at North Carolina State University who specializes in lexicology, said "truthiness" means "truthy, not facty". "The national argument right now is, one, 'Who's got the truth?' and, two, 'Who's got the facts?{{'"}} he said. "Until we can manage to get the two of them back together again, we're not going to make much progress."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On each of the first four episodes of the ''Report'' after the selection of ''truthiness'' as ''Word of the Year,'' Colbert lamented that news reports neglected to acknowledge him as the source of the word. On the first of these episodes, he added Michael Adams to his "On Notice" board, and Associated Press reporter Heather Clark, the author of the article, to his "Dead to Me" board:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/videos/notice/index.jhtml |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos: On Notice (A Glaring Omission)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"You see, the Associated Press article announcing this prestigious award, written by one Heather Clark, had a glaring omission: me," Colbert said during his show Monday. "I'm not mentioned, despite the fact that truthiness is a word I pulled right out of my keister."&lt;ref name=Kiser &gt;{{Citation |last=Kiser |first=Emily |date=January 10, 2006 |title=Colbert puts professor 'on notice': Michael Adams, featured in a recent Associated Press article, incurs the wrath of Comedy Central 'pundit' |publisher=''[[Technician (newspaper)|Technician]]'' |url=http://www.technicianonline.com/article_895be1b8-7968-5f83-b414-2957431242ac.html |accessdate=February 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later Adams admitted the "absolutely hilarious" nature of the show and said he couldn't "think of any greater honor than to be placed on Colbert's 'On Notice' board," and that he "owes Colbert thanks."&lt;ref name=Kiser /&gt;

On the third of these episodes, he ranked the AP at the top of the "Threat-Down",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/videos/threatdown/index.jhtml |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos: Threatdown}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of few entries ever to gain the number one spot in place of bears. On the following episode he called Adams and asked for an apology. Though Adams never apologized, Colbert "accepted" his "apology", but failed to take him "off notice".

====Associated Press response to Colbert====
On January 13, the first day after the four-day run of criticism of the AP on the ''Report,'' the AP ran a story about ''The Colbert Report'' being upset about being snubbed by the AP, in an article titled "Colbert: AP the biggest threat to America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/13/ap/entertainment/mainD8F3VNT8E.shtml |title=Colbert: AP the biggest threat to America |first=Jake |last=Coyle |publisher=CBS News / Associated Press |date=January 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 7, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005202936/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/13/ap/entertainment/mainD8F3VNT8E.shtml |archivedate=October 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he has in the past, Colbert remained in character in an interview for the story, and used it to further the political satire of ''truthiness''; excerpts of the story are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When an AP story about the designation sent coast to coast failed to mention Colbert, he began a tongue-in-cheek crusade, not unlike the kind his muse [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] might lead in all seriousness."

{{"'}}It's a sin of omission...' Stephen Colbert told the AP on Thursday...'It's like Shakespeare still being alive and not asking him what ''Hamlet'' is about,' he said."

"The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' has a definition for 'truthy' dating back to the 1800s....'The fact that they looked it up in a book just shows that they don't get the idea of truthiness at all,' Stephen Colbert said Thursday. 'You don't look up truthiness in a book, you look it up in your gut.{{'"}}

"Though slight, the difference of Colbert's definition and the OED's is essential. It's not your typical truth, but, as ''The New York Times'' wrote, 'a summation of what [Colbert] sees as the guiding ethos of the loudest commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN.{{'"}}

"Colbert, who referred on his program to the AP omission as a 'journalistic travesty,' said Thursday that it was similar to the much-criticized weapons of mass destruction reporting leading up to the Iraq War. 'Except,' he said, 'people got hurt this time.'"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On January 14, Clark herself responded in an article titled "Exclusive 'News' – I'm dead to Stephen Colbert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asap.ap.org/stories/293280.s |last=Clark |first=Healther |date=January 14, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Exclusive "News": I'm Dead to Stephen Colbert |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929161104/http://asap.ap.org/stories/293280.s |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She furthered the rise of "truthiness" in published English in conceding, "Truthiness be told, I never had seen ''The Colbert Report'' until my name graced its 'Dead to Me' board this week... But I will say that I watched Colbert's show for the first time...It was funny. And that's not just truthy. That's a fact."

===Arianna Huffington===
On January 31, 2006, [[Arianna Huffington]] used ''truthiness'' in [[The Huffington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/will-americas-new-love-a_b_14809.html |date=January 31, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=Will America's New Love Affair With the Truth Extend to Bush's SOTU Speech? |work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huffington later appeared as a guest on the March 1, 2006, episode of ''The Colbert Report''. She challenged Colbert on his claim that he had invented the word ''truthiness''. During the interview, Colbert declared, "I'm not a truthiness fanatic; I'm truthiness' father." Huffington corrected him, citing Wikipedia, that he had merely "popularized" the term. Regarding her source, Colbert responded: "Fuck them!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/59703/march-01-2006/arianna-huffington |date=March 1, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos (Arianna Huffington)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===President George W. Bush===
At the [[Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner|2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner]], Colbert, the featured guest, described President Bush's thought processes using the definition of truthiness. ''Editor and Publisher'' used "truthiness" to describe Colbert's criticism of Bush, in an article published the same day titled "Colbert Lampoons Bush at White House Correspondents Dinner—President Not Amused?" ''E&amp;P'' reported that the "blistering comedy 'tribute' to President Bush ... left George and Laura Bush unsmiling at its close" and that many people at the dinner "looked a little uncomfortable at times, perhaps feeling the material was a little too biting—or too much speaking 'truthiness' to power".&lt;ref name="editor-and-publisher-2006.04.29"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002425363 |publisher=Editor and Publisher |title=Colbert Lampoons Bush at White House Correspondents Dinner—President Not Amused? |author=E&amp;P Staff |date=April 29, 2006 |accessdate=May 7, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060531012834/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002425363 &lt;!--http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A16F83B5B0C768EDDA90994DD404482--&gt; |archivedate=May 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''E&amp;P'' reported a few days later that its coverage of Colbert at the dinner drew "possibly its highest one-day traffic total ever", and published a letter to the editor asserting that "Colbert brought truth wrapped in truthiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/PrintArticle/TUESDAY-S-LETTERS-Colbert-Offensive-Colbert-Mediocre-Colbert-a-Hero-Colbert-Vicious-Colbert-Brave |title=Tuesday's Letters: Colbert Offensive, Colbert Mediocre, Colbert a Hero, Colbert Vicious, Colbert Brave |author=E&amp;P Staff |date=May 2, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same weekend, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and others also reported on the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/29/AR2006042900126.html |title=Dept. of Truthiness: The Colbert Rapport |newspaper=The Washington Post |issn=0740-5421 |date=March 30, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/05/01/colbert/index_np.html |title=The truthiness hurts |first=Michael |last=Scherer |journal=Salon |date=May 1, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615011439/http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/05/01/colbert/index_np.html |archivedate=June 15, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/27/60minutes/main1553506.shtml |date=March 30, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2006 |title=The Colbert Report: Morley Safer Profiles Comedy Central's "Fake" Newsman |work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later, in a column titled "Throw The Truthiness Bums Out", ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[Frank Rich]] called Colbert's after-dinner speech a "cultural primary" and christened it the "defining moment" of the United States' [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]].&lt;ref name="nytimes-truthiness-bums"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/opinion/05rich.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |issn=0362-4331 |title=Throw the Truthiness Bums Out |first=Frank |last=Rich |authorlink=Frank Rich |date=November 5, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washpost-bubble-trouble"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2006/11/07/BL2006110700726_5.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |issn=0740-5421 |title=Bubble Trouble |first=Dan |last=Froomkin |authorlink=Dan Froomkin |date=November 7, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Krauthammer===
Conservative commentator [[Charles Krauthammer]] brought the term up in a discussion about President Obama on the show ''[[Fox News All-Stars]]'' in June 2010, saying:
{{quote|What we see here is conditional truthiness. When the administration needs to say, oh, we knew how bad it was, it says it, and when it needs to say we had no idea how bad it was, it says it. It depends when it needs it; it'll invent a new truth.&lt;ref&gt;

===Cato Institute amicus brief===
In 2014, the [[Cato Institute]] filed an amicus brief to the [[United States Supreme Court]] co-authored by humorist [[P. J. O'Rourke]] in the ''[[Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus]]'' free speech case. The brief included an extended discussion of the role of truthiness in American political discourse:&lt;ref name="urlCato AmicusBrief"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/sba-list-merits-filed-brief.pdf |title=Brief for the Cato Institute and P.

{{quote|In modern times, "truthiness"—a "truth" asserted "from the gut" or because it "feels right," without regard to evidence or logic—is also a key part of political discourse. It is difficult to imagine life without it, and our political discourse is weakened by Orwellian laws that try to prohibit it.

After all, where would we be without the knowledge that Democrats are pinko-communist flag-burners who want to tax churches and use the money to fund abortions so they can use the fetal stem cells to create pot-smoking lesbian ATF agents who will steal all the guns and invite the UN to take over America? Voters have to decide whether we'd be better off electing Republicans, those hateful, assault-weapon-wielding maniacs who believe that George Washington and Jesus Christ incorporated the nation after a Gettysburg reenactment and that the only thing wrong with the death penalty is that it isn't administered quickly enough to secular-humanist professors of Chicano studies.}}

==={{anchor|Trumpiness}}''The Late Show with Stephen Colbert''===
Colbert refreshed "truthiness" in an episode of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' on July 18, 2016, using the neologism "Trumpiness" regarding statements made by [[Donald Trump]] during [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|his presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2016/07/22/colbert_goes_after_trumpiness_his_live_rnc_coverage_revives_the_comedy_of_the_colbert_report/ | title=Colbert goes After Trumpiness: His live RNC coverage revives the comedy of "The Colbert Report" | work=Salon | date=22 July 2016 | accessdate=16 August 2016 | author=McClennen, Sophia}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Colbert, while truthiness refers to statements that feel true but are actually false, "Trumpiness" does not even have to feel true, much less be true. As evidence that Trump's remarks exhibit this quality, he cited a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' column stating that many Trump supporters did not believe his "wildest promises" but supported him anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theweek.com/speedreads/636881/stephen-colbert-resurrects-colbert-report-word-segment-define-trumpiness | title=Stephen Colbert resurrects his Colbert Report 'The Word' segment to define 'Trumpiness' | work=The Week | date=19 July 2016 | accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/19/12222520/the-word-colbert-trumpiness-rnc | title=Watch: Stephen Colbert brings back "The Word" to deconstruct the Trump supporter's psyche | work=Vox | date=19 July 2016 | accessdate=16 August 2016 | author=Golshan, Tara}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/07/stephen-colbert-late-show-rnc-jon-stewart | title=Stephen Colbert Brought Back "Stephen Colbert" (and Jon Stewart) During His R.N.C.

'''Volturnalia''' was the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[festival]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.akademiai.com/content/rq3800r1j56p82q8/&lt;/ref&gt; on [[August 27]] dedicated to [[Volturnus]], 'god of the waters,' god of fountains. Volturnus was a tribal river god who later was identified as god of the [[Tiber]] river. The [[Volturno]] River, in southern Italy, is named for him.  Volturnus was the father of the goddess Juturna, who was first identified with a spring in [[Latium]] near the [[Numicus]] River and later with a pool near the [[Temple of Vesta]] in the Forum of Rome. They were both honored on this day with feasting, wine-drinking, and games.

This article covers the [[history of Afghanistan]] since the communist military coup on 27 April 1978, known as the [[Saur Revolution]], when the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) took power. Since that day, an almost continuous series of armed conflicts has dominated and afflicted [[Afghanistan]].

After this [[Saur Revolution]], most of [[Afghanistan]] experienced uprisings against the PDPA government. The [[Soviet–Afghan War]] began in December 1979 to replace the existing communist government. Afghanistan's resistance forces, known as the [[Afghan Jihad|mujahideen]], fought against the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. Some factions received support from the United States, with the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] serving as the U.S. middleman, and Saudi Arabia. The [[Soviet Union]] had to withdraw its troops in February 1989. The Soviet-backed Afghan communist government survived for three more years until the fall of Kabul in 1992.

In 1992, the Afghan political parties agreed on the [[Peshawar Accords]] which established the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] and appointed an interim government. Militia leader [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] was opposed to the agreement and with Pakistani support started a bombardment campaign against Kabul. Additionally, three militias who had been able to occupy some suburbs of Kabul engaged in a violent war against each other. Regional powers such as [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[India]] and [[Uzbekistan]] seeking influence over the geostrategically located Afghanistan each supported and in some cases controlled one of those militias. While Kabul and some other major cities witnessed most of the fighting during that period, most of the more rural parts of Afghanistan, which had seen especially massive bombardment by the Soviets and Communists, remained relatively calm. In late 1994/early 1995, as the Islamic State's minister of defense [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] had been able to defeat most of the militias militarily in Kabul and had restored some calm to the capital, the Taliban emerged as a new faction threatening Kabul.

The [[Taliban]] had initially emerged as a new force in the southern city of [[Kandahar]] conquering many southern and central provinces not under Islamic State control in the course of 1994. In early 1995, as they launched a major operation against the capital Kabul, they suffered a devastating defeat against the Islamic State forces of Massoud in what many analysts saw as the movement's end. By 1996, however, they had regrouped with massive military support by Pakistan and financial support by Saudi Arabia. In September 1996 they took power in Kabul and established the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]]. The [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Islamic Front]] (Northern Alliance) was created under the leadership of [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] as a military-political resistance force against the Taliban Emirate which was backed militarily by [[Pakistan Army|Pakistan's Army]] and enforced by several thousand [[al-Qaeda]] fighters from [[Arab]] countries and [[Central Asia]].

Following the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States in 2001, [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2014)|NATO invaded Afghanistan]] under [[Operation Enduring Freedom]]. The purpose of this was to defeat al-Qaeda, to remove the Taliban from power, and to create a viable democratic state to deny terrorists a place to recruit and operate. Although some of these objectives were achieved, a protracted and costly period of intervention followed and continues as of 2018.

=== Prelude ===
[[File:1950s Afghanistan - Public transport in Kabul.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Public transport in a peaceful Afghan capital [[Kabul]] in the 1950s]]
From 1933 to 1973 Afghanistan witnessed a lengthy period of peace and relative stability.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/24/world/asia/24shah.html|title=Mohammad Zahir Shah, Last Afghan King, Dies at 92|last=Bearak|first=Barry|date=24 July 2007|work=|publisher=The New York Times|via=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was ruled as a monarchy by King [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]] who belonged to the Afghan [[Musahiban]] [[Barakzai dynasty]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Judah"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/23/terrorism.afghanistan1|title=Profile: Mohamed Zahir Shah|last=Judah|first=Tim|date=23 September 2001|work=|publisher=The Observer|via=|accessdate=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, Afghanistan as a constitutional monarchy held limited parliamentary elections.&lt;ref name="FAS"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RS21922.pdf|title=Afghanistan: Politics, Elections, and Government Performance|last=Katzman|first=Kenneth|date=30 March 2012|work=|publisher=Congressional Research Service|via=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zahir Shah, who would become the last [[List of monarchs of Afghanistan|King of Afghanistan]], was overthrown by his cousin [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] in [[1973 Afghan coup d'état|July 1973]] after discontent with the monarchy growing in the urban areas of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The country had witnessed several droughts and charges of corruption and poor economic policies were leveled against the ruling dynasty. Khan transformed the [[monarchy]] into a [[republic of Afghanistan|republic]] with him becoming the first [[President of Afghanistan]]. He was supported by a faction of the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA), Afghanistan's communist party, which had been founded in 1965 and enjoyed strong relations with the Soviet Union. Neamatollah Nojumi writes in ''The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region'':

{{quote|The establishment of the Republic of Afghanistan increased the Soviet investment in Afghanistan and the PDPA influence in the government's military and civil bodies.&lt;ref name="Neamatollah Nojumi"&gt;{{Cite book| last =Neamatollah Nojumi | authorlink = | title =The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition= 2002 1st |pages=38–42| publisher = Palgrave, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By 1976, alarmed by the growing power of the PDPA and the party's strong affiliation with the Soviet Union, Daoud Khan tried to scale back the PDPA's influence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{Cite book| last =Neamatollah Nojumi | authorlink = | title =The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition= 2002 1st |page=39| publisher = Palgrave, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; He dismissed PDPA members from their government posts, appointed conservative elements instead and finally announced the dissolution of the PDPA arresting senior party members.&lt;ref name="Neamatollah Nojumi" /&gt;

=== Communist coup ===
On April 27, 1978, the PDPA and military units loyal to the PDPA, killed Daoud Khan, his immediate family, and bodyguards in a violent coup, and seized control of the capital, Kabul.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{Cite book| last =Neamatollah Nojumi | authorlink = | title =The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition= 2002 1st |page=41| publisher = Palgrave, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the PDPA had chosen a weekend holiday, when many government employees were having a day off, as the time to conduct the coup, Daoud Khan had not been able to activate fully in time the well-trained armed forces which remained loyal to him to counter the coup.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8" /&gt;
[[File:Day after Saur revolution in Kabul (773).jpg|thumbnail|Outside of the Presidential Palace in Kabul the day after the Saur Revolution of 1978, 28th April 1978.]]
The new PDPA government, led by a revolutionary council, did not enjoy the support of the masses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite book |last=Neamatollah Nojumi |title=The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition= 2002 1st |page=42|publisher=Palgrave, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it soon announced and implemented a hostile doctrine against any political dissent, whether inside or outside the party.&lt;ref name="Neamatollah Nojumi" /&gt; The first communist leader in Afghanistan, [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]], was assassinated by his fellow communist [[Hafizullah Amin]].&lt;ref name="AFG"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/83854.stm|title=World: Analysis Afghanistan: 20 years of bloodshed|last=|first=|date=26 April 1998|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amin was known for his independent and nationalist inclinations, and was also seen by many as a ruthless leader. He has been accused of killing tens of thousands of Afghan civilians at [[Pul-e-Charkhi prison|Pul-e-Charkhi]] and other national prisons. 27,000 politically motivated executions reportedly took place at [[Pul-e-Charkhi prison]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?ei=EEY4TZ2GGsXTrQfdsZmZCA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=-4oHrInacy8C&amp;dq=%27%27Soldiers+of+God%3A+With+Islamic+Warriors+in+Afghanistan+and+Pakistan%27%27&amp;q=Pul-i-Charki Soldiers of God: With Islamic Warriors in Afghanistan and Pakistan]'' by Robert D. Kaplan. Vintage, 2001. {{ISBN|1-4000-3025-0}} p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soviet intervention and withdrawal ===
The Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan on December 24, 1979. Amin was deposed from power almost immediately, as he and 200 of his guards were [[Operation Storm-333|killed]] on December 27 by [[Soviet Army]] [[Spetsnaz]], replaced by [[Babrak Karmal]]. After deployment into Afghanistan, Soviet forces along with government forces would begin to engage in a protracted [[counter-insurgency]] war with [[mujahideen]] fighters. Some of those Islamic fighters would later transform into the [[Taliban]] according to Professor [[Carole Hillenbrand]] who stated: "The West helped the Taliban to fight the Soviet takeover of Afghanistan".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hillenbrand|2015|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Evstafiev-spetsnaz-prepare-for-mission.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Soviet Army|Soviet]] [[Spetsnaz]] group prepares for a mission in 1988]]

The [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] realized that a military solution to the conflict would require far more troops. Because of this they discussed troop withdrawals and searched for a political and peaceful solution as early as 1980, but they never took any serious steps in that direction until 1988. Early Soviet military reports confirm the difficulties the Soviet army had while fighting on the mountainous terrain, for which the Soviet army had no training whatsoever. Parallels with the [[Vietnam War]] were frequently referred to by Soviet army officers.&lt;ref name="kgb"&gt;{{cite web|author=Svetlana Savranskaya |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB57/soviet.html |title=Volume II: Afghanistan: Lessons from the Last War |publisher=The National Security Archive |accessdate=2009-03-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312032535/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB57/soviet.html |archivedate= 12 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy failures, and the stalemate that ensued after the Soviet intervention, led the Soviet leadership to become highly critical of Karmal's leadership. Under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the Soviet Union was able to depose Karmal and replace him with [[Mohammad Najibullah]]. Karmal's leadership was seen as a failure by the Soviet Union because of the rise of violence and crime during his administration.

Throughout the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, troop convoys came under attack by Afghan rebel fighters. In all, 523 Soviet soldiers were killed during the withdrawal. The total withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Afghanistan was completed in February 1989.&lt;ref name="AFGHA"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2007/07/17/GR2007071700070.html|title=How Not to End a War|last=|first=|date=17 July 2007|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Soviet soldier to leave was [[Lieutenant General]] [[Boris Gromov]], leader of the Soviet military operations in Afghanistan at the time of the Soviet invasion.&lt;ref name="last"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/02/20092158556204114.html |title=Russia marks Afghanistan retreat |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=2009-03-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309204618/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/02/20092158556204114.html|archivedate=9 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total 14,453 Soviet soldiers died during the Afghan war.

The Soviet war had a damaging impact on Afghanistan. Soviet forces and their proxies committed a genocide against the Afghan people and killed up to 2 million Afghans.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft7b69p12h;brand=ucpress|title=The Soviet Invasion and the Afghan Response, 1979–1982|last=Kakar|first=Mohammed |publisher=University of California Press|year=|isbn=978-0-520-20893-3|location=|pages=|quote=The Afghans are among the latest victims of genocide by a superpower.

Pakistan's [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] functioned as an organisational and networking base for the anti-Soviet Afghan resistance, with the province's influential [[Deobandi]] ulama playing a major supporting role in promoting the 'jihad'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haroon|first=Sana|year=2008|title=The Rise of Deobandi Islam in the North-West Frontier Province and Its Implications in Colonial India and Pakistan 1914–1996|jstor=27755911|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society|volume=18|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fall of communism ===
After the Soviet withdrawal, the Republic of Afghanistan under Najibullah continued to face resistance from the various mujahideen forces. Najibullah received funding and arms from the Soviet Union until 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed.&lt;ref name="AFGSOV"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/14/newsid_4419000/4419833.stm |title=1988: USSR pledges to leave Afghanistan|last=|first=|date=14 April 1988|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-03-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417090326/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/14/newsid_4419000/4419833.stm|archivedate=17 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years the [[Afghan Army]] had actually increased their effectiveness past levels ever achieved during the Soviet military presence. But the government was dealt a major blow when [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], a leading general, created an alliance with the [[Shura-e Nazar]] of [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]]. Large parts of the Afghan communist government capitulated to the forces of Massoud in early 1992. After the Soviet defeat, the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' named Massoud "the Afghan who won the Cold War".&lt;ref name="Charlie Rose"&gt;{{cite web|year=2001 |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2911290068493351924# |title=Charlie Rose March 26, 2001 |publisher=[[CBS]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417165736/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2911290068493351924 |archivedate=April 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had defeated the Soviet forces nine times in his home region of the [[Panjshir Valley]] in northeastern Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/05/27/massoud.afghanistan/|title=He would have found Bin Laden|last=|first=|date=27 May 2009|publisher=CNN|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan tried to install [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] in power in Afghanistan against the opposition of all other mujahideen commanders and factions.&lt;ref name=Tomsen&gt;{{cite book |last=Tomsen|first=Peter|title=Wars of Afghanistan|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-763-8|pages=405–408}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as October 1990, the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] had devised a plan for Hekmatyar to conduct a mass bombardment of the Afghan capital Kabul with possible Pakistani troop enforcements.&lt;ref name="Tomsen" /&gt; This unilateral ISI-Hekmatyar plan came although the thirty most important mujahideen commanders had agreed on holding a conference inclusive of all Afghan groups to decide on a common future strategy.&lt;ref name="Tomsen" /&gt; [[Peter Tomsen]] reports that the protest by the other mujahideen commanders was like a "firestorm". [[Ahmad Zia Massoud]], the brother of Ahmad Shah Massoud, said that his faction strongly opposed the plan and like other factions would take measures if any "Pakistani troops reinforced Hekmatyar". [[Abdul Haq (Afghan leader)|Abdul Haq]] was reportedly so angry about the ISI plan that he was "red in the face".&lt;ref name="Tomsen" /&gt; And Nabi Mohammad, another commander, pointed out that "Kabul's 2 million could not escape Hekmatyar's rocket bombardment&amp;nbsp;– there would be a massacre."&lt;ref name="Tomsen" /&gt; Massoud's, Abdul Haq's and Amin Wardak's representatives said that "Hekmatyar's rocketing of Kabul ... would produce a civilian bloodbath."&lt;ref name="Tomsen" /&gt; The United States finally put pressure on Pakistan to stop the 1990 plan, which was subsequently called off until 1992.&lt;ref name="Tomsen" /&gt;

{{blockquote|The sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]], an entity created in April 1992, after the fall of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-backed Najibullah government. [...] With the exception of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s [[Hezb-e Islami]], all of the parties [...] were ostensibly unified under this government in April 1992. [...] Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami, for its part, refused to recognize the government for most of the period discussed in this report and launched attacks against government forces and [[Kabul]] generally. [...] Shells and rockets fell everywhere.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch (4)" /&gt;}}

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar received operational, financial and military support from [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{Cite book| last =Neamatollah Nojumi | authorlink = | title =The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition= 2002 1st |pages=| publisher = Palgrave, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan expert [[Amin Saikal]] concludes in ''Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival'':

{{blockquote|Pakistan was keen to gear up for a breakthrough in [[Central Asia]].

Due to the sudden initiation of the war, working government departments, police units or a system of justice and accountability for the newly created Islamic State of Afghanistan did not have time to form.

=== Taliban rise to power ===
Southern Afghanistan was under the control of neither foreign-backed militias nor the government in Kabul, but was ruled by local leaders such as [[Gul Agha Sherzai]] and their militias. In 1994, the [[Taliban]] (a movement originating from [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]]-run religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan) also developed in Afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to the [[tyranny]] of the local governor.&lt;ref name="Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25"&gt;Matinuddin, Kamal, ''The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994–1997'', [[Oxford University Press]], (1999), pp.25–6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] started his movement with fewer than 50 armed [[madrassah]] students in his hometown of Kandahar.&lt;ref name="Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25" /&gt; When the Taliban took control of the city in 1994, they forced the surrender of dozens of local Pashtun leaders who had presided over a situation of complete lawlessness and atrocities.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch (5)" /&gt; In 1994, the Taliban took power in several provinces in southern and central Afghanistan.

In late 1994, most of the militia factions (Hezb-i Islami, Junbish-i Milli and Hezb-i Wahdat) which had been fighting in the battle for control of Kabul were defeated militarily by forces of the Islamic State's [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]].

Massoud, like most people in Afghanistan, saw this conference as a small hope for democracy and for free elections. His favourite for candidacy to the presidency was Dr. [[Mohammad Yusuf (prime minister)|Mohammad Yusuf]], the first democratic prime minister under [[Zahir Shah]], the former king. In the first meeting representatives from 15 different Afghan provinces met, in the second meeting there were already 25 provinces participating. Massoud went unarmed to talk to several Taliban leaders in Maidan Shar, but the Taliban declined to join this political process.&lt;ref name="Webster University Press Book" /&gt; When Massoud returned safely, the Taliban leader who had received him as his guest paid with his life: he was killed by other senior Taliban for failing to execute Massoud while the possibility was there.

The Taliban started shelling Kabul in early 1995 but were defeated by forces of the Islamic State government under [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]].&lt;ref name="amnesty.org" /&gt; [[Amnesty International]], referring to the Taliban offensive, wrote in a 1995 report:
{{blockquote|This is the first time in several months that Kabul civilians have become the targets of rocket attacks and shelling aimed at residential areas in the city.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org" /&gt;}}

The Taliban's early victories in 1994 were followed by a series of defeats that resulted in heavy losses.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch (5)" /&gt; [[Pakistan]] provided strong support to the Taliban.&lt;ref name="Amin Saikal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="George Washington University"&gt;{{cite web|year=2007 |url =http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB227/index.htm#17 |title=Documents Detail Years of Pakistani Support for Taliban, Extremists |publisher=[[George Washington University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many analysts like [[Amin Saikal]] describe the Taliban as developing into a [[Proxy war|proxy]] force for Pakistan's regional interests which the Taliban decline.&lt;ref name="Amin Saikal" /&gt;

On September 26, 1996, as the Taliban, with military support by Pakistan and financial support by Saudi Arabia, prepared for another major offensive, Massoud ordered a full retreat from Kabul.&lt;ref&gt;Coll, ''Ghost Wars'' (New York: Penguin, 2005), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban seized Kabul on September 27, 1996, and established the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]].

The Taliban imposed on the parts of Afghanistan under their control their interpretation of [[Islam]]. The [[Physicians for Human Rights]] (PHR) stated that:

{{quote|To PHR's knowledge, no other regime in the world has methodically and violently forced half of its population into virtual [[house arrest]], prohibiting them on pain of physical punishment.&lt;ref name="Physicians for Human Rights"&gt;{{cite web |year=1998 |url=http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/library/documents/reports/talibans-war-on-women.pdf |title=The Taliban's War on Women.

Women were required to wear the all-covering ''[[burqa|burka]]'', they were banned from public life and denied access to health care and education, windows needed to be covered so that women could not be seen from the outside, and they were not allowed to laugh in a manner that could be heard by others.&lt;ref name="Physicians for Human Rights" /&gt; The Taliban, without any real court or hearing, cut people's hands or arms off when they were accused of stealing.&lt;ref name="Physicians for Human Rights" /&gt; Taliban hit-squads watched the streets, conducting arbitrary brutal public beatings.&lt;ref name="Physicians for Human Rights" /&gt;

The Taliban began preparing offensives against the remaining areas controlled by [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]]. Massoud and Dostum, former foes, responded by allying to form the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Front]] (Northern Alliance) against the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|EvYglyjbHkI}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the dominantly [[Tajik people|Tajik]] forces of Massoud and the [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] forces of Dostum, the United Front included [[Hazara people|Hazara]] factions and [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] forces under the leadership of commanders such as [[Abdul Haq (Afghan leader)|Abdul Haq]] or [[Haji Abdul Qadir]]. Prominent politicians of the United Front were in example diplomat and Afghan prime minister [[Abdul Rahim Ghafoorzai]] or the UF's foreign minister [[Abdullah Abdullah]]. From the Taliban conquest in 1996 until November 2001 the United Front controlled roughly 30% of Afghanistan's population in provinces such as [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]], [[Kapisa Province|Kapisa]], [[Takhar Province|Takhar]] and parts of [[Parwan Province|Parwan]], [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]], [[Laghman Province|Laghman]], [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], [[Kunduz Province|Kunduz]], [[Ghōr Province|Ghōr]] and [[Bamyan Province|Bamyan]].

=== Role of the Pakistani Armed Forces ===
[[Pakistan]]'s intelligence agency, the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI), wanted the Mujahideen to establish a government in Afghanistan. The director-general of the ISI, [[Hamid Gul]], was interested in an Islamic revolution which would transcend national borders, not just in Afghanistan and Pakistan but also in [[Central Asia]]. To set up the proposed Mujahideen government, Hamid Gul ordered an assault on [[Jalalabad]]-with the intent on using it as the capital for the new government Pakistan was interested in establishing in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/08/legacy-pakistan-loved-loathed-hamid-gul-150817114006616.html|title=The legacy of Pakistan's loved and loathed Hamid Gul|last=Nasir|first=Abbas|date=18 August 2015|publisher=Al Jazeera|quote=His commitment to jihad – to an Islamic revolution transcending national boundaries, was such that he dreamed one day the "green Islamic flag" would flutter not just over Pakistan and Afghanistan, but also over territories represented by the (former Soviet Union) Central Asian republics.

On August 1, 1997 the Taliban launched an attack on Sheberghan, the main military base of Abdul Rashid Dostum.

In 2000, the UN Security Council imposed an arms embargo against military support to the Taliban, with UN officials explicitly singling out Pakistan.

=== Anti-Taliban resistance ===
[[File:Ahmad Zia Massoud 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Ahmad Zia Massoud]] (left), the brother of anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Massoud]]
[[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] and his forces were defeated by the Taliban in 1998. Dostum subsequently went into exile. The only leader to remain in Afghanistan, and who was able to defend vast parts of his area against the Taliban, was [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]]. In the areas under his control Ahmad Shah Massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the [[Women's Rights]] Declaration.&lt;ref name=autogenerated32&gt;{{Cite book| last = Marcela Grad| authorlink = Marcela Grad| title = Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition= March 1, 2009 |page=310 | publisher = Webster University Press| isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of Massoud, women and girls did not have to wear the Afghan burqa. They were allowed to work and to go to school. In at least two known instances, Massoud personally intervened against cases of forced marriage.&lt;ref name="Webster University Press Book" /&gt; To Massoud there was reportedly nothing worse than treating a person like an object.&lt;ref name="Webster University Press Book" /&gt; He stated:

{{quote|It is our conviction and we believe that both men and women are created by the Almighty. Both have equal rights. Women can pursue an education, women can pursue a career, and women can play a role in society&amp;nbsp;— just like men.&lt;ref name="Webster University Press Book" /&gt;}}

Author Pepe Escobar wrote in ''Massoud: From Warrior to Statesman'':

{{quote|Massoud is adamant that in Afghanistan women have suffered oppression for generations. He says that 'the cultural environment of the country suffocates women. But the Taliban exacerbate this with oppression.' His most ambitious project is to shatter this cultural prejudice and so give more space, freedom and equality to women&amp;nbsp;— they would have the same rights as men.&lt;ref name="Webster University Press Book" /&gt;}}

While it was Massoud's stated conviction that men and women are equal and should enjoy the same rights, he also had to deal with Afghan traditions which he said would need a generation or more to overcome. In his opinion that could only be achieved through education.&lt;ref name="Webster University Press Book" /&gt; Humayun Tandar, who took part as an Afghan diplomat in the 2001 [[International Conference on Afghanistan]] in Bonn, said that "strictures of language, ethnicity, region were [also] stifling for Massoud. That is why ... he wanted to create a unity which could surpass the situation in which we found ourselves and still find ourselves to this day."&lt;ref name="Webster University Press Book" /&gt; This applied also to strictures of religion. Jean-José Puig describes how Massoud often led prayers before a meal or at times asked his fellow Muslims to lead the prayer but also did not hesitate to ask a Christian friend Jean-José Puig or the Jewish [[Princeton University|Princeton]] Professor Michael Barry: "Jean-José, we believe in the same God. Please, tell us the prayer before lunch or dinner in your own language."&lt;ref name="Webster University Press Book" /&gt;

Human Rights Watch cites no human rights crimes for the forces under direct control of Massoud for the period from October 1996 until the assassination of Massoud in September 2001.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/afghan-bck1005.htm#uf |title = Human Rights Watch Backgrounder, October 2001| publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One million people fled the Taliban, many to the area of Massoud.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpQI6HKV-ZY&amp;feature=related |title = Inside the Taliban| publisher = [[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2007 |url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/inside-the-taliban-3274/Overview |title=Inside the Taliban |publisher=[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929130330/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/inside-the-taliban-3274/Overview |archivedate=September 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]] concluded in its documentary ''"Inside the Taliban"'':

{{quote|The only thing standing in the way of future Taliban massacres is Ahmad Shah Massoud.&lt;ref name="National Geographic" /&gt;}}

The Taliban repeatedly offered Massoud a position of power to make him stop his resistance. Massoud declined. He explained in one interview:

{{quote|The Taliban say: "Come and accept the post of prime minister and be with us", and they would keep the highest office in the country, the presidentship. But for what price?! The difference between us concerns mainly our way of thinking about the very principles of the society and the state. We can not accept their conditions of compromise, or else we would have to give up the principles of modern democracy. We are fundamentally against the system called "the Emirate of Afghanistan".&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite web |year =2001 |url =http://www.orient.uw.edu.pl/balcerowicz/texts/Ahmad_Shah_Masood_en.htm |title =The Last Interview with Ahmad Shah Massoud |publisher =Piotr Balcerowicz |access-date =2013-11-23 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20060925043421/http://www.orient.uw.edu.pl/balcerowicz/texts/Ahmad_Shah_Masood_en.htm |archive-date =2006-09-25 |dead-url =yes |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And in another:

{{quote|There should be an Afghanistan where every Afghan finds himself or herself happy. And I think that can only be assured by democracy based on consensus.&lt;ref name="St. Petersburg Times" /&gt;}}

Massoud with his [https://web.archive.org/web/20120310123118/http://www.peace-initiatives.com/frame.htm Proposals for Peace] wanted to convince the Taliban to join a political process leading towards nationwide democratic elections in a foreseeable future.&lt;ref name="Interview" /&gt;  Massoud also stated:

{{quote|The Taliban are not a force to be considered invincible. They are distanced from the people now. They are weaker than in the past.

In early 2001 Massoud employed a new strategy of local military pressure and global political appeals.&lt;ref name="Steve Coll: Ghost Wars"&gt;{{cite book | last = Steve Coll| authorlink = Steve Coll| title =Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001 |edition= February 23, 2004 |page=720| publisher =Penguin Press HC | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Resentment was increasingly gathering against Taliban rule from the bottom of Afghan society including the Pashtun areas.&lt;ref name="Steve Coll: Ghost Wars" /&gt; Massoud publicized their cause of "popular consensus, general elections and democracy" worldwide. At the same time he was very wary not to revive the failed Kabul government of the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Steve Coll: Ghost Wars" /&gt; In 1999, he began training police forces specifically to keep order and protect the civilian population, in case the United Front was successful.&lt;ref name="Webster University Press Book" /&gt;

The funeral, though in a rather rural area, was attended by hundreds of thousands of mourning people.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Aq-zqA1DMWs|Ahmad Shah Massoud Sad Day Part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assassination was not the first time Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]], and before them the Soviet [[KGB]], the Afghan Communist [[KHAD]] and [[Hekmatyar]] had tried to assassinate Massoud. He survived countless assassination attempts over a period of 26 years. The first attempt on Massoud's life was carried out by Hekmatyar and two Pakistani ISI agents in 1975, when Massoud was only 22 years old.&lt;ref name="Roy Gutman" /&gt; In early 2001, Al-Qaeda would-be assassins were captured by Massoud's forces while trying to enter his territory.&lt;ref name="Steve Coll: Ghost Wars" /&gt;

=== 9/11 connection ===
The assassination of Massoud is considered to have a strong connection to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the United States, which killed nearly 3000 people, and which appeared to be the terrorist attack that Massoud had warned against in his speech to the European Parliament several months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/11/06/massoud.cable/|title=CNN.com – How much did Afghan leader know? - Nov.  6, 2003|last=CNN|first=From Mike Boettcher and Henry Schuster|website=www.cnn.com|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John P. O'Neill]] was a counter-terrorism expert and the Assistant Director of the [[FBI]] until late 2001. He retired from the FBI and was offered the position of director of security at the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] (WTC). He took the job at the WTC two weeks before 9/11. On September 10, 2001, O'Neill allegedly told two of his friends, "We're due. And we're due for something big.... Some things have happened in Afghanistan.

After the [[9/11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] of September 11, 2001, Massoud's United Front troops, with American air support, ousted the Taliban from power in Kabul in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].

The [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|US-led war in Afghanistan]] began on October 7, 2001, as [[Operation Enduring Freedom]]. It was designed to capture or kill [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[al-Qaeda]] militants, as well as replace the Taliban with a US-friendly government.

Several Afghan leaders were invited to [[Germany]] in December 2001 for the UN sponsored [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|Bonn Agreement]], which was to restore stability and governance in their country.

A constitutional loya jirga was held in December 2003, adopting the new [[Constitution of Afghanistan|2004 constitution]], with a presidential form of government and a bicameral legislature.&lt;ref name="BBCNews"&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4540756.stm |title=Afghan MPs hold landmark session |publisher=''BBC News'' | accessdate=2009-03-15 | date=2005-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karzai was elected in the [[Afghan presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] followed by winning a second term in the [[Afghan presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential election]]. Both the  [[Afghan parliamentary election, 2005|2005]] and the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 2010|2010 parliamentary elections]] were also successful.

{{anchor|Reconstruction in Afghanistan}}
In the meantime, the reconstruction process of Afghanistan began in 2002. There are more than 14,000 reconstruction projects under way in Afghanistan, such as the [[Kajaki Dam|Kajaki]] and the [[Salma Dam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/03/642FF16A-41C2-4AF2-B314-1D7BAEDDFAE6.html|title=Afghanistan: NATO Pleased With Offensive, But Goals Still Unmet|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these projects are being supervised by the [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]]s. The World Bank contribution is the multilateral Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), which was set up in 2002. It is financed by 24 international donor countries and has spent more than $1.37 billion as of 2007.&lt;ref name="AFGReco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/AFGHANISTANEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20152008~pagePK:141137~piPK:217854~theSitePK:305985,00.html |title=Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund |publisher=''World Bank'' | accessdate=2009-03-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090202093827/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/AFGHANISTANEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20152008~pagePK:141137~piPK:217854~theSitePK:305985,00.html| archivedate= 2 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 30 billion dollars have been provided by the international community for the reconstruction of Afghanistan, most of it from the United States. In 2002, the world community allocated $4 billion at the Tokyo conference followed by another $4 billion in 2004. In February 2006, $10.5 billion were committed for Afghanistan at the [[International Conference on Afghanistan (2006)|London Conference]]&lt;ref name="AFGR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=51510&amp;SelectRegion=Asia&amp;SelectCountry=AFGHANISTAN |title=Government to have greater control over aid pledged in London |publisher=''IRIN Asia'' | accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $11 billion from the United States in early 2007. Despite these vast investments by the international community, the reconstruction effort's results have been mixed. Implementation of development projects at the district and sub-district level has been frequently marred by lack of coordination, knowledge of local conditions, and sound planning on the side of international donors as well as by corruption and inefficiency on the side of Afghan government officials. On the provincial and national level, projects such as the National Solidarity Programme, inter-provincial road construction, and the US-led revamping of rural health services have met with more success. As NATO prepares to withdraw the majority of remaining ISAF troops by the end of 2014, whether the Afghan government will be able to sustain the developmental gains made over the past 12 years, and to what extent international civilian aid organizations will be able to continue operations or refocus their efforts based on lessons learned, remains to be seen.

The [[UN Security Council]] established the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) in December 2001 to provide basic security for the people of Afghanistan and assist the [[Karzai administration]]. Since 2002, the total number of ISAF and U.S. forces have climbed from 15,000 to 150,000. The majority of them belong to various branches of the [[United States Armed Forces]], who are not only fighting the [[Taliban insurgency]] but also training the [[Afghan Armed Forces]] and [[Afghan National Police]]. They are scheduled to withdraw slowly until the end of 2014 but [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]] has proposed to retain an unknown number of U.S. [[military personnel]] after the 2014 deadline if the security situation required and the Afghan government and people desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110111/wl_sthasia_afp/afghanistanunrestusbiden_20110111142049 |accessdate=October 14, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany has announced that they will continue training Afghan police recruits after the 2014 withdrawal date for military troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5933456,00.html|title=Berlin to train Afghan police even after security handover|work=DW.DE|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NATO and [[Afghan National Army|Afghan troops]] led many offensives against the Taliban in this period. By 2009, a Taliban-led shadow government began to form, complete with their own version of mediation court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/07/AR2009120704127.html | work=The Washington Post | accessdate=2010-03-30 | title=Taliban shadow officials offer concrete alternative | first=Griff | last=Witte | date=2009-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] deployed an additional 30,000 soldiers over a period of six months and proposed that he would begin troop withdrawals by 2012. At the [[International Conference on Afghanistan (2010)|2010 International Conference on Afghanistan]] in [[London]], [[President of Afghanistan|Afghan President]] [[Hamid Karzai]] said he intended to reach out to the Taliban leadership (including [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]], [[Sirajuddin Haqqani]] and [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]). Supported by senior U.S. officials Karzai called on the group's leadership to take part in a [[loya jirga]] meeting to initiate peace talks. According to the ''Wall Street Journal'', these steps were initially reciprocated with an intensification of bombings, assassinations and ambushes.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703720004575476913015061570| work=The "Wall Street Journal"| accessdate=2010-09-11 | title=Karzai Divides Afghanistan in Reaching Out to Taliban | first=Yaroslav| last=Trofimov| date=2010-09-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100912162856/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703720004575476913015061570.html| archivedate= 12 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Afghan groups (including the former intelligence chief [[Amrullah Saleh]] and opposition leader Dr. [[Abdullah Abdullah]]) believe that Karzai's plan aims to appease the insurgents' senior leadership at the cost of the democratic constitution, the democratic process and progress in the field of human rights, especially women's rights.&lt;ref name="The Scotsman"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.scotsman.com/world/Karzai39s-Taleban-talks-raise-spectre.6557817.jp| work=The Scotsman| accessdate= | title=Karzai's Taleban talks raise spectre of civil war warns former spy chief | first=| last=| date=2010-09-30| location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Abdullah stated:

So, for them, I don't think that we have a way forward with talks or negotiations or contacts or anything as such. Then we have to be prepared to tackle and deal with them militarily. In terms of the Taliban on the ground, there are lots of possibilities and opportunities that with the help of the people in different parts of the country, we can attract them to the peace process; provided, we create a favorable environment on this side of the line.

At the end of July 2010, the Netherlands became the first NATO ally to end its combat mission in Afghanistan after 4 years military deployment including the most intense period of hostilities. They withdrew 1,900 troops.

In February 2012, a small number of American service members [[2012 Afghanistan Quran burning protests|burned several copies]] of the Quran. Some Afghans responded with massive demonstrations and riots in Kabul and other areas. Assailants killed several American military personnel, including two officers in the Interior Ministry building following this event.

On March 11, 2012, an American soldier, [[Robert Bales]], killed 16 civilians in the [[Kandahar massacre]].

According to [[ISAF]] there were about 120,000 NATO-led troops in Afghanistan per December 2012, of which 66,000 were US troops and 9,000 British. The rest were from 48 different countries. A process of handing over power to local forces has started and according to plans a majority of international troops will leave in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11371138|title=BBC News – Q&amp;A: Foreign forces in Afghanistan|work=BBC News|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 24, 2013, President Karzai made a [[Loya jirga]] and put a ban on NATO house raids. This ban was put in place, and NATO soldiers were instructed to obey and follow this ban. In December 2013, a house raid in Zabul Province was exceptionally carried out by two NATO soldiers. Karzai condemned this in a highly publicised speech. On January 3, 2014 a bomb was heard by NATO soldiers in a base in Kabul; there were no reported casualties or injuries.  The day after, a bomb hit a US military base in Kabul and killed one US citizen. The bomb was planted by the Taliban and the American service member was the first combat casualty in Afghanistan in that year. The Taliban immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.

'''William Henry Hance''' (November 10, 1951&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt; – March 31, 1994) was an American soldier and [[serial killer]] who is believed to have murdered four women in and around military bases before his arrest in 1978. He was convicted of murdering three of them, and not brought to trial on the fourth. He was executed by the state of Georgia in the [[electric chair]].

==Investigation==
In 1978, [[Columbus, Georgia]] was undergoing a wave of murders of women. Several elderly white women had been killed by a perpetrator nicknamed the [[Stocking Strangler]]. In addition, the bodies of two young [[African-American|black]] prostitutes had been found outside of [[Fort Benning]] nearby.&lt;ref name=RESSLER&gt;[[Robert K. Ressler|Robert Ressler]] and Tom Schactman,''Whoever Fights Monsters:  My Twenty Years Hunting Serial Killers for the FBI''. St Martin's Press, 1992. ''See'' pp. 157-161. {{ISBN|0-312-95044-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disparate groups of victims were linked by a letter to the local police chief written on [[United States Army]] stationery. The handwritten note purported to be from a gang of seven white men who were holding a black woman hostage and would kill her if the Stocking Strangler were not apprehended. The Stocking Strangler was believed to be a black man, and this had been widely reported at the time.&lt;ref name=RESSLER/&gt;

The seven white vigilantes wished to be known as the "Forces of Evil," and wanted the police chief to communicate with them via messages on radio or television. The first letter was followed by others; eventually, a ransom demand of $10,000 was also made to keep the alleged hostage, Gail Jackson, alive. (Jackson was also known as Brenda Gail Faison and other aliases.)&lt;ref name=CRIMEZ/&gt; The letters were followed by phone calls.&lt;ref name=RESSLER/&gt;

The letters and calls were a hoax intended to divert attention from the real killer. Gail Jackson, the supposed hostage, had been murdered five weeks before she was found, and before the first letter was sent. Her body was discovered in early April, 1978.  She was 21 years old.&lt;ref name=UPI&gt;[http://www.newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=15417180&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=2 ''GI Held In Murders''], [[United Press International]] April 6, 1978.  Retrieved from''Newport Daily News'' (Rhode Island) via NewspaperArchive.Com November 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP04/&gt; Soon afterward, following instructions in yet another call from the "Forces of Evil," a second black woman's corpse was found at a rifle range at Fort Benning.  Her name was Irene Thirkield.&lt;ref name=RESSLER/&gt; She was 32.&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt;

[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] profiler [[Robert K. Ressler]] created a profile which asserted that the killer was one man, not seven; black, not white; single, not well-educated, and probably a low-ranking military man at the fort in his late twenties.&lt;ref name=RESSLER/&gt;

Using the profile and aware that both Jackson and Thirkield were prostitutes, [[Georgia Bureau of Investigation]] officers searched near the fort for bars which had generally black patrons. They were quickly able to identify William Hance and arrest him.  He was a Specialist Four attached to an [[artillery]] unit at the fort&lt;ref name=RESSLER/&gt; as a truck driver.&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt; Hance had begun his military career as a Marine before joining the Army.&lt;ref name=AP04&gt;[http://www.newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=109397923&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=3 ''Georgia Inmate Executed for Murdering Prostitute''], [[Associated Press]] report April 4, 1994.  Retrieved from ''Logansport Pharos-Tribune'' at NewspaperArchive.Com November 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

When confronted with evidence including his handwriting, voice recordings, and shoe prints from the crime scenes, Hance confessed to killing both women and to the killing of a third woman at Fort Benning in September 1977.&lt;ref name=RESSLER/&gt;  Karen Hickman, 24, was a white Army private known to date black soldiers and socialize in black pubs.&lt;ref name=CRIMEZ&gt;[http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkillers/H/HANCE_william_henry.php ''Hance, William Henry: Forces of Evil''], Serial Killer Crime Index at Crimezzz.Net. Retrieved November 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Hance was not charged with Hickman's murder in the civilian system, but was tried, charged, and convicted by a court martial for her death.

Eventually, Hance was also identified as the killer of a young black woman at [[Fort Benjamin Harrison]] in Indiana.&lt;ref name=RESSLER/&gt; Hance was not charged with this murder.

However, despite his four known [[femicide]]s, he was innocent of the Stocking Strangler murders, eventually attributed to another black man, [[Carlton Gary]].&lt;ref name=RESSLER/&gt;

* Hance was also tried and convicted in a court martial, but not a civilian court, for the murder of Karen Hickman.&lt;ref name=AP04/&gt;
* During his court martial for the murder of Irene Thirkield, Hance received a life sentence which was reversed when jurors decided he lacked the mental capacity for premeditation.&lt;ref name=TIME0411&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980479,00.html Doubts on Death Row], April 11, 1994, TIME Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;
* For the deaths of both Hickman and Thirkield, Hance's final court martial sentence was life at hard labor.  The convictions were set aside in 1980 and he was not retried by the military court system.&lt;ref name=AP04/&gt;

===Civilian courts===
* [http://vlex.com/vid/20404189 Hance v. State], 245 Ga. 856, 268 S.E.2d 339, ''[[certiorari|cert.]] denied'', 449 U.S. 1067, 101 S.Ct. 796, 66 L.Ed.2d 611 (1980). In this case, Hance's conviction and sentence of death in the Jackson murder were affirmed by the Georgia Supreme Court.  The Thirkield murder is also included in the Court's summation of the facts.
* Hance v. Zant, 456 U.S. 965, 102 S.Ct. 2046, 72 L.Ed.2d 491 (1982). The United States Supreme Court denied [[certiorari]] in Hance's ''[[habeas corpus]]'' appeal in the Jackson murder.
* [http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/696/940/328752/  William Henry Hance, Petitioner, v. Walter D. Zant, Warden, Georgia Diagnostic And Classification Center, Respondent] United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit. 696 F.2d 940, ''cert. denied'', 463 U.S. 1210, 103 S.Ct. 3544, 77 L.Ed.2d 1393 (1983). After the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear his first ''habeas'' petition in the Jackson case in 1982, the federal appellate court for the 11th Circuit, which includes Georgia, affirmed Hance's conviction but ordered a retrial of the sentencing stage because the prosecutor's closing argument rendered the sentencing proceeding fundamentally unfair, and because two jurors were improperly excluded in violation of [[Witherspoon v.

Illinois]],'' 391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; The federal appellate court therefore ordered the state court system to provide a new, more fair, sentencing phase trial for the murder of Jackson.

Hance then appealed to the federal appellate court for the 11th Circuit, which decided the case in January, 1993.
* [http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/981/1180/21559/  William Henry Hance, Petitioner-appellant, v.

Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc ''Denied'' March 11, 1993.  In a relatively brief order, a panel of the federal appellate court in the 11th Circuit denied Hance's ''habeas'' appeal in the Jackson murder, and denied him the opportunity to present his case to the full appellate bench (instead of the panel).

==Execution==
Hance was sentenced to death in civilian court for the murder of Gail Jackson and in military court for the death of Irene Thirkield. His military death sentence for Thirkield was overturned.&lt;ref name=TIME0411/&gt;  His civilian death sentence for Jackson was not. He was [[List of individuals executed in Georgia (U.S. state)|executed by the state of Georgia]] on March 31, 1994, via the [[electric chair]]. He was the 231st inmate executed nationwide since the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; and the 18th in Georgia.&lt;ref name=AP04/&gt;

In the hours before his death, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] voted, 6-3, not to consider his appeal.  In dissent, Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] said that even if he had not recently...

{{Quote|...reached the conclusion that the death penalty cannot be imposed fairly within the constraints of our Constitution . . . I could not support its imposition in this case. ... There is substantial evidence that William Henry Hance is mentally retarded as well as mentally ill. There is reason to believe that his trial and sentencing proceedings were infected with racial prejudice. One of his sentencers has come forward to say that she did not vote for the death penalty because of his mental impairments.&lt;ref name=HERBERT&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07EFD6133FF930A35757C0A962958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all ''In America, Judicial Coin Toss''] by Bob Herbert, April 3, 1994. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hance had an [[IQ]] of 75-79 points, which classifies him as "borderline intellectual functioning" on modern medical scales of [[mental retardation]].&lt;ref name=AP04/&gt;

==Controversy==
Other issues besides Hance's mental and psychiatric status had created controversy prior to the day of his electrocution, and one—the question of racial bias in the state sentencing jury—veritably exploded afterwards. The [[Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles]] had not even proofread its order denying his stay of execution, and conflated it with another document about some other prisoner. The [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Supreme Court]] denied his appeal by only one vote, 4-3.&lt;ref name=HERBERT/&gt;

One of his jurors at his second sentencing (after the first was reversed for [[prosecutorial misconduct]]),&lt;ref name=HERBERT-MAR30/&gt; a white woman named Patricia Lemay, came forward to report that other jurors made racial remarks about Hance such as "just one more sorry nigger that no one would miss"&lt;ref name=HERBERT/&gt; and, if executed, he would be "one less nigger to breed."&lt;ref name=HERBERT-MAR30&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE2DD143FF933A05750C0A962958260 ''In America, Jury Room Injustice''] by Bob Herbert, March 30, 1994. ''New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;

There was only one black juror, a 26-year-old woman named Gayle Lewis Daniels.  According to Lemay, Daniels was subjected to racial invective in the jury room.&lt;ref name=HERBERT-MAR27/&gt;  According to both Lemay and Daniels herself, Daniels refused to vote for the death penalty.  The other jurors ignored her and reported to the judge that they were unanimous.  When the jury was polled in the presence of the court, Daniels was by then too frightened to speak up.  The other jurors had told her that she could be convicted of [[perjury]] if she continued to hold out, since she had testified, during jury selection, that she could vote for the death penalty.&lt;ref name=HERBERT-MAR27&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E7D71F3CF934A15750C0A962958260 ''In America; Mr. Hance's "Perfect Punishment"''], by Bob Herbert, March 27, 1994.  ''New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence of Lemay and Daniels outraged many press outlets.  Said one newspaper afterwards, {{Quote|Hance might as well have been [[lynching|lynched]], for he was denied due process of law. ... There is compelling evidence that the law was not followed, that Hance's civil rights were violated, that he was a victim of racism and political expediency.&lt;ref name=SHA&gt;[http://www.newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=28752114&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=2 ''Questions linger after execution:  pungent aroma of justice denied''], unsigned editorial, ''Syracuse Herald American'' (New York), April 3, 1994.  Retrieved from NewspaperArchive.Com November 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At a law school conference the following year, attorney [[Ronald J. Tabak]] stated at some length his opinion that Hance's race contributed to the sentence.&lt;ref name=AU&gt;[http://www.wcl.american.edu/journal/lawrev/45/death.html ''Conference Proceedings: The Death Penalty in the Twenty-First Century''], December 1995, ''[[American University]] Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Castle romeo2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Nuclear warfare]] is often a common theme of World War III scenarios. Such a conflict could result in the [[Human extinction|extinction of mankind itself]].]]
'''World War III''' ('''WWIII''' or '''WW3''') and the '''Third World War''' are names given to a hypothetical third [[World war|worldwide large-scale military conflict]] subsequent to [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The term has been in use since at least as early as 1941. Some have applied it loosely to refer to limited or smaller conflicts such as the [[Cold War]] or the [[War on Terror]], while others have operated under the assumption that such a conflict would surpass both prior world wars in both the level of its widespread scope and of its overall destructive impact.&lt;ref name="einstein"&gt;The New Quotable Einstein. By Alice Calaprice (2005), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the [[Manhattan Project|development]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use]] of [[nuclear weapon]]s near the end of World War II and their subsequent acquisition and deployment by [[List of states with nuclear weapons|many countries]], the potential risk of a nuclear devastation of Earth's civilization and life is a common theme in speculations of a Third World War. Another major concern is that [[biological warfare]] could cause a very large number of casualties, either intentionally or inadvertently by an accidental release of a biological agent, the unexpected mutation of an agent, or its adaptation to other species after use. High-scale [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] events like these, caused by advanced technology used for destruction, could potentially make [[Earth's surface]] uninhabitable.

Prior to the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914–1918) was believed to have been the "[[The war to end war|war to end all wars]]," as it was popularly believed that never again could there possibly be a global conflict of such magnitude. During the inter-war period between the two world wars, WWI was typically referred to simply as "The Great War." The outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 disproved the hope that mankind might have already "outgrown" the need for such widespread global wars.

With the advent of the Cold War in 1945 and with the spread of nuclear weapons technology to the [[Soviet Union]], the possibility of a third global conflict became more plausible. During the Cold War years the possibility of a Third World War was anticipated and planned for by military and civil authorities in many countries. Scenarios ranged from [[conventional warfare]] to limited or total nuclear warfare. At the height of the Cold War, a scenario referred to as [[Mutual assured destruction|Mutually Assured Destruction]] ("MAD") had been calculated which determined that an all-out nuclear confrontation would most certainly destroy all or nearly all human life on the planet. The potential absolute destruction of the human race may have contributed to the ability of both American and Soviet leaders to avoid such a scenario.

==Military plans==
Military planners have been war gaming various scenarios, preparing for the worst, since the early days of the Cold War. Some of those plans are now out of date and have been partially or fully declassified.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Operation Unthinkable===
{{main|Operation Unthinkable}}
[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] was concerned that, with the enormous size of Soviet forces deployed in Europe at the end of WWII and the unreliability of the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], there was a serious threat to Western Europe. In April–May 1945, [[British Armed Forces]] developed [[Operation Unthinkable]], thought to be the first scenario of the Third World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book |author1=Jonathan Walker |title=Operation Unthinkable: The Third World War|date=2013 |publisher=[[The History Press]] |isbn=978-0-7524-8718-2 |page=192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary goal was "to impose upon Russia the will of the United States and the British Empire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = British War Cabinet, Joint Planning Staff, Public Record Office, CAB 120/691/109040 / 002 | date = 11 August 1945 | url = http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/| title = Operation Unthinkable: 'Russia: Threat to Western Civilization'| format = online photocopy| publisher = Department of History, Northeastern University| accessdate = 28 June 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080706093010/http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;| archivedate = 6 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was rejected by the British [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]] as militarily unfeasible.

===Operation Dropshot===
{{Main|Operation Dropshot}}
"Operation Dropshot" was the 1950s United States contingency plan for a possible [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] and conventional war with the [[Soviet Union]] in the Western European and Asian theaters.

At the time the US nuclear arsenal was limited in size, based mostly in the United States, and depended on bombers for delivery. "Dropshot" included mission profiles that would have used 300 nuclear bombs and 29,000 high-explosive bombs on 200 targets in 100 cities and towns to wipe out 85% of the Soviet Union's industrial potential at a single stroke. Between 75 and 100 of the 300 nuclear weapons were targeted to destroy Soviet combat aircraft on the ground.

The scenario was devised prior to the development of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s. It was also devised before [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] and his [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] changed the US Nuclear War plan from the 'city killing' countervalue strike plan to a "counterforce" plan (targeted more at military forces). Nuclear weapons at this time were not accurate enough to hit a naval base without destroying the city adjacent to it, so the aim in using them was to destroy the enemy industrial capacity in an effort to cripple their war economy.

===Exercises Grand Slam, Longstep, and Mainbrace===
{{main|Exercise Longstep|Exercise Grand Slam|Exercise Mainbrace}}
In January 1950, the [[North Atlantic Council]] approved NATO's military strategy of [[containment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/3.htm |title=Chapter 3 – The Pace Quickens |accessdate=2011-09-19 |work=NATO the first five years 1949–1954 |publisher=[[NATO]] |author=Lord Ismay}}&lt;/ref&gt; NATO military planning took on a renewed urgency following the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in the early 1950s, prompting NATO to establish a "force under a centralised command, adequate to deter aggression and to ensure the defence of Western Europe".

Exercise Mainbrace brought together 200 ships and over 50,000 personnel to practice the defence of Denmark and Norway from Russian attack in 1952. It was the first major NATO exercise. The exercise was jointly commanded by [[Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic]] [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Lynde D. McCormick]], [[United States Navy|USN]], and [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe#Supreme Allied Commander Europe .28SACEUR.29|Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] [[General (United States)|General]] [[Matthew B. Ridgeway]], [[US Army]], during the autumn of 1952.

The US, UK, Canada, France, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Netherlands, and Belgium all participated.

Exercises Grand Slam and Longstep were naval exercises held in the Mediterranean Sea during 1952 to practice dislodging an enemy occupying force and amphibious assault. It involved over 170 warships and 700 aircraft under the overall command of Admiral Carney. The overall exercise commander, Admiral Carney summarized the accomplishments of Exercise Grand Slam by stating: "We have demonstrated that the senior commanders of all four powers can successfully take charge of a mixed task force and handle it effectively as a working unit."{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The USSR called the exercises "war-like acts" by NATO, with particular reference to the participation of [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]], and prepared for its own military maneuvers in the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet Zone]].&lt;ref name=Time2&gt;''Time'', 29 September 1952&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sidney&gt;"NATO Ships Enter Baltic Sea" – ''Sydney Morning Herald'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Strikeback===
{{main|Operation Strikeback}}
This was a major NATO naval exercise held in 1957, simulating a response to an all-out Soviet attack on NATO. The exercise involved over 200 warships, 650 aircraft, and 75,000 personnel from the [[United States Navy]], the United Kingdom's [[Royal Navy]], the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], the [[French Navy]], the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], and the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]]. As the largest peacetime naval operation up to that time, Operation Strikeback was characterized by military analyst [[Hanson W. Baldwin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "constituting the strongest striking fleet assembled since World War II".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |last=Baldwin |first=Hanson W. |authorlink=Hanson W.

===Exercise Reforger===
[[File:Earnest Will Gas King.jpg|thumb|237px|If activated, Operation Reforger would have largely consisted of convoys like this one from [[Operation Earnest Will]] in 1987, although much larger. While troops could easily fly across the Atlantic, the heavy equipment and armor reinforcements would have to come by sea.]]
{{Main|Exercise Reforger}}{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}

Exercise Reforger (from '''re'''turn of '''for'''ces to '''Ger'''many) was an annual exercise conducted, during the Cold War, by [[NATO]]. The exercise was intended to ensure that NATO had the ability to quickly deploy forces to West Germany in the event of a conflict with the [[Warsaw Pact]].
The Warsaw Pact outnumbered NATO throughout the Cold War in conventional forces, especially armor. Therefore, in the event of a Soviet invasion, in order not to resort to tactical nuclear strikes, NATO forces holding the line against a Warsaw Pact armored spearhead would have to be quickly resupplied and replaced. Most of this support would have come across the Atlantic from the US and Canada.

Reforger was not merely a show of force—in the event of a conflict, it would be the actual plan to strengthen the NATO presence in Europe. In that instance, it would have been referred to as Operation Reforger. Important components in Reforger included the [[Military Airlift Command]], the [[Military Sealift Command]], and the [[Civil Reserve Air Fleet]].

===Seven Days to the River Rhine===
{{Main|Seven Days to the River Rhine}}
[[File:Probable Axes of Attack.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A Warsaw Pact invasion would have come via three main paths through West Germany.]]
Seven Days to the River Rhine was a top secret military simulation exercise developed in 1979 by the Warsaw Pact. It started with the assumption that NATO would launch a nuclear attack on the [[Vistula]] river valley in a [[first strike|first-strike]] scenario, which would result in as many as two million Polish civilian casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|author=Nicholas Watt in Warsaw |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/26/russia.poland#article_continue |title=Poland risks Russia's wrath with Soviet nuclear attack map &amp;#124; World news |journal=The Guardian |date=2005-11-26 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a Soviet counter-strike would be carried out against [[West Germany]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Denmark]], with Warsaw Pact forces invading West Germany and aiming to stop at the River Rhine by the seventh day. Other USSR plans stopped only upon reaching the French border on day nine. Individual Warsaw Pact states were only assigned their own subpart of the strategic picture; in this case, the Polish forces were only expected to go as far as Germany. The Seven Days to the Rhine plan envisioned that Poland and Germany would be largely destroyed by nuclear exchanges, and that large numbers of troops would die of [[radiation sickness]]. It was estimated that NATO would fire nuclear weapons behind the advancing Soviet lines to cut off their supply lines and thus blunt their advance. While this plan assumed that NATO would use nuclear weapons to push back any Warsaw Pact invasion, it did not include nuclear strikes on France or the United Kingdom. Newspapers speculated when this plan was declassified, that France and the UK were not to be hit in an effort to get them to withhold use of their own nuclear weapons.

===Exercise Able Archer===
{{main|Able Archer 83}}
[[File:Reagan and Gordievsky.jpg|thumb|right|upright|President [[Ronald Reagan]] and Soviet double agent [[Oleg Gordievsky]], who later told the west how close the Able Archer 83 exercise had brought the Soviets to ordering a [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|First Strike]].]]
Exercise Able Archer was an annual exercise by the United States military in Europe that practiced command and control procedures, with emphasis on transition from solely conventional operations to chemical, nuclear, and conventional operations during a time of war.

"Able Archer 83" was a five-day [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) [[command post]] [[military exercise|exercise]] starting on 7 November 1983, that spanned [[Western Europe]], centered on the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) Headquarters in [[Casteau]], north of the city of [[Mons]]. Able Archer exercises simulated a period of [[conflict escalation]], culminating in a coordinated [[nuclear attack]].&lt;ref name = "Fischer Conundrum"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-cold-war-conundrum/source.htm#HEADING1-12|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|title=A Cold War Conundrum: The 1983 Soviet War Scare|author=Benjamin B.

The realistic nature of the 1983 exercise, coupled with [[Cold War (1979–85)|deteriorating relations]] between the United States and the Soviet Union and the anticipated arrival of [[Nuclear strategy|strategic]] [[Pershing II]] nuclear missiles in Europe, led some members of the Soviet Politburo and military to believe that Able Archer 83 was a [[ruse of war]], obscuring preparations for a genuine nuclear [[first strike]].&lt;ref name = "Fischer Conundrum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew and Gordievsky, ''Comrade Kryuchkov's Instructions'', 85–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Fischer Reversal 123,31"&gt;Beth Fischer, ''Reagan Reversal'', 123, 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pry Scare 37–9"&gt;Pry, ''War Scare'', 37–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Soviets readied their nuclear forces and placed air units in [[East Germany]] and [[History of Poland (1945–89)|Poland]] on alert.&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorfer, ''A New Era'', 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "SNIE 84"&gt;''SNIE 11–10–84'' "Implications of Recent Soviet Military-Political Activities" Central Intelligence Agency, 18 May 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic Defense Initiative===
{{main|Strategic Defense Initiative}}
The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was proposed by U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] on 23 March 1983.&lt;ref name="fas_milestones"&gt;[[Federation of American Scientists]]. [https://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/milestone.htm Missile Defense Milestones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306023546/http://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/milestone.htm |date=6 March 2016 }}. Accessed 10 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the later part of his [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|presidency]], numerous factors (which included watching the 1983 movie ''[[The Day After]]'' and hearing through a Soviet defector that [[Able Archer 83]] almost triggered a Russian [[first strike]]) had turned Ronald Reagan against the concept of winnable nuclear war, and he began to see nuclear weapons as more of a "[[Wild card (foresight)|wild card]]" than a strategic deterrent. Although he later believed in disarmament treaties slowly blunting the danger of nuclear weaponry by reducing their number and alert status, he also believed a technological solution might allow incoming ICBMs to be shot down, thus making the US invulnerable to a first strike. However the USSR saw the SDI concept as a major threat, since unilateral deployment of the system would allow the US to launch a massive first strike on the Soviet Union without any fear of retaliation.

The SDI concept was to use ground-based and space-based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[ballistic missile]]s. The initiative focused on strategic defense rather than the prior strategic offense doctrine of [[Mutual Assured Destruction]] (MAD). The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) was set up in 1984 within the [[United States Department of Defense]] to oversee the Strategic Defense Initiative.

===NATO nuclear sharing===

NATO operational plans for a Third World War have involved NATO allies who do not have their own nuclear weapons, using nuclear weapons supplied by the United States as part of a general NATO war plan, under the direction of NATO's Supreme Allied Commander.

Of the three nuclear powers in NATO ([[France]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]), only the United States has provided weapons for nuclear sharing. {{As of|2009|11}}, [[Belgium]], [[Germany and weapons of mass destruction|Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands and weapons of mass destruction|Netherlands]] and [[Turkey]] are still hosting US nuclear weapons as part of NATO's nuclear sharing policy.&lt;ref name=RUSI-2010&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.rusi.org/publications/occasionalpapers/ref:O4B991ABDC4148/|title=NATO's Tactical Nuclear Dilemma|author=Malcolm Chalmers|author2=Simon Lunn|last-author-amp=yes|date=March 2010|publisher=[[Royal United Services Institute]]|accessdate=2010-03-16|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,618550,00.html Der Spiegel: ''Foreign Minister Wants US Nukes out of Germany'' (2009-04-10)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canada and weapons of mass destruction|Canada]] hosted weapons until 1984,&lt;ref name=canada-nw&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5-R7EJ0r680C|title=Canadian Nuclear Weapons: The Untold Story of Canada's Cold War Arsenal|author=John Clearwater|date=1998|publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd.|isbn=978-1-55002-299-5|accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Greece]] until 2001.&lt;ref name=RUSI-2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=26|url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/euro/euro.pdf|title=U.S. Nuclear Weapons in Europe|author=Hans M.

==Historical close calls==
{{main|Nuclear warfare}}
{{see also|List of nuclear close calls}}
With the initiation of the [[Cold War]] [[arms race]] in the 1950s, an [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] war between the United States and the Soviet Union became a real possibility.  During the Cold War era (1947–1991), a number of military events have been described as having come quite close to potentially triggering World War III.

=== Korean War: 25 June 1950&amp;nbsp;– 27 July 1953 ===
The [[Korean War]] was a war between two coalitions fighting for control over the [[Korean Peninsula]]: a communist coalition including North Korea, China and the USSR, and a capitalist coalition including South Korea, the United States, and the UN. Many then believed that the conflict was likely to soon escalate into a full-scale war between the three countries, the US, the USSR, and China. [[CBS News|CBS]] war correspondent [[Bill Downs]] wrote in 1951 that, "To my mind, the answer is: Yes, Korea is the beginning of World War III. The brilliant [[Battle of Inchon|landings at Inchon]] and the cooperative efforts of the American armed forces with the United Nations Allies have won us a victory in Korea. But this is only the first battle in a major international struggle which now is engulfing the Far East and the entire world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Downs|first=Bill|title=World War III in Asia?|newspaper=See Magazine|date=March 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downs afterwards repeated this belief on ''[[ABC World News Tonight|ABC Evening News]]'' while reporting on the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|USS ''Pueblo'' incident]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Downs|first=Bill|title=The USS Pueblo incident|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KBxiX_9_Kk|work=ABC Evening News with Bob Young|publisher=ABC Evening News|accessdate=8 November 2013|date=25 January 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuban Missile Crisis: 15–28 October 1962 ===
;{{Refimprove section|date=September 2017}}
[[File:Soviet b-59 submarine.jpg|thumb|A US Navy [[HSS-1 Seabat]] helicopter hovers over Soviet submarine ''B-59'', forced to the surface by US Naval forces in the Caribbean near Cuba. B-59 had a nuclear torpedo on board, three officer keys were required to use it. Only one dissent prevented the submarine from attacking the US fleet nearby, a spark that could have led to a Third World War (October 28–29, 1962).]]
The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]: a confrontation on the stationing of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, in response to the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], is considered as having been the closest to a nuclear exchange, which could have precipitated a Third World War. The crisis peaked on 27 October, with three separate major incidents occurring on the same day, all of these incidents having been initiated by the US military.

* The "Arkhipov save" incident occurred when a Soviet submarine nearly launched a nuclear-tipped torpedo in response to having been targeted by American naval [[depth charge]]s in international waters, with the Soviet nuclear launch response only having being prevented by Soviet naval officer [[Vasili Arkhipov]]. 
* The shooting down of a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] while violating Cuban airspace. 
* The near interception of another U-2 that had somehow managed to stray into Soviet airspace over Siberia, which airspace violation nearly caused the Soviets to believe that this might be the vanguard of a US aerial bombardment.

Despite what many believe to be the closest the world has come to a nuclear conflict, throughout the entire standoff, the [[Doomsday Clock]], which is run by the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] to estimate how close the end of the world, or doomsday, is, with midnight being the apocalypse, stayed at a relatively stable seven minutes to midnight. This has been explained as being due to the brevity of the crisis, since the clock monitored more long term factors such as leadership of countries, conflicts, wars, and political upheavals, as well as societies reactions to said factors.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists now credits the political developments resulting from the Cuban Missile Crisis with having actually enhanced global stability.  The Bulletin posits that future crises and occasions that might otherwise escalate, were rendered as more stable due to two major factors: 
# A Washington to Moscow [[Moscow–Washington hotline|direct telephone line]], resulted from the communication trouble between the [[White House]] and the [[Kremlin]] during the crisis, giving the leaders of the two largest nuclear powers the ability to contact each other in real time, rather than sending written messages that needed to be translated and wired, which had dragged out conversations in which seconds could have potentially prevented a nuclear exchange.
# The second factor was caused in part due to the worldwide reaction to how close the US and USSR had come to the brink of World War III during the standoff.  As the public began to more closely monitor topics involving nuclear weapons, and therefore to rally support for the cause of non-proliferation, the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|1963 test ban treaty]] was signed.  To date this treaty has been signed by 126 total nations, with the most notable exceptions being [[France and weapons of mass destruction|France]] and [[China and weapons of mass destruction|China]].  Both of these countries were still in the relative beginning stages of their nuclear programs at the time of the original treaty signing, and both sought nuclear capabilities independent of their allies.

::-This Test Ban Treaty prevented the testing of nuclear ordnance that detonated in the atmosphere, limiting testing to below ground and under water, decreasing fallout and effects on the environment, and subsequently caused the Doomsday Clock to decrease by five minutes, to arrive at a total of twelve minutes to midnight. Up until this point, over 1000 nuclear bombs had been detonated, and concerns over both long and short term affects to the planet became increasingly more worrisome to scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thebulletin.org/remembering-cuban-missile-crisis |title=Remembering the Cuban Missile Crisis |date=16 October 2012 |website=thebulletin.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2017|reason=only the part about doomsday clock is in article}}

=== Yom Kippur War super-power tensions: 6–25 October 1973 ===
The [[Yom Kippur War]], also known as the Ramadan War, or October War, began with Arab victories. Israel successfully counterattacked. Tensions grew between the US (which supported Israel) and the Soviet Union (which sided with the Arab states). American and Soviet naval forces came close to firing upon each other. Admiral Murphy of the US reckoned the chances of the Soviet squadron attempting a first strike against his fleet at 40 percent. The Pentagon moved Defcon status from 4 to 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/commentary/the-little-known-us-soviet-confrontation-during-yom-kippur-wa|title=The little-known US-Soviet confrontation during Yom Kippur War|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The superpowers had been pushed to the brink of war, but tensions eased with the ceasefire brought in under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 339|UNSC 339]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/erol-araf-incalculable-consequences|title=Erol Araf: 'Incalculable consequences'|publisher=|date=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/0-271-01489-X.html|title=Inside the Kremlin During the Yom Kippur War By Victor Israelyan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NORAD computer error of 1979: 9 November 1979 ===
The United States made emergency retaliation preparations after NORAD saw on-screen indications that a full-scale Soviet attack had been launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBC Digital Archives|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/war-conflict/defence/norad-watching-the-skies/norad-false-alarm-causes-uproar.html|publisher=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; No attempt was made to use the "[[Moscow–Washington hotline|red telephone]]" hotline to clarify the situation with the USSR and it was not until early-warning radar systems confirmed no such launch had taken place that NORAD realized that a computer system test had caused the display errors. A senator inside the NORAD facility at the time described an atmosphere of absolute panic. A GAO investigation led to the construction of an off-site test facility to prevent similar mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andrews|first1=Evan|title=5 Cold War Close Calls|url=http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/5-cold-war-close-calls|publisher=The History Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Petrov save" incident: 26 September 1983 ===
A [[1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident|false alarm]] occurred on the [[Oko|Soviet nuclear early warning system]], showing the launch of American Minuteman ICBMs from bases in the United States. A retaliatory attack was prevented by [[Stanislav Petrov]], an officer of the Soviet Air Defence Forces, who realised the system had simply malfunctioned (which was borne out by later investigations).&lt;ref name="wash"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/coldwar/shatter021099b.htm | title=I Had A Funny Feeling in My Gut | first=David | last=Hoffman | publisher=Washington Post |date=10 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold War's Riskiest Moment |publisher=Baltimore Sun, 31 August 2003 (article reprinted as ''The Nuclear War That Almost Happened in 1983'') |url=http://hnn.us/articles/1709.html#bombs9-5-03 |first=Scott |last=Shane |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819033034/http://hnn.us/articles/1709.html |archivedate=19 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Able Archer escalations: 2–11 November 1983 ===
During [[Able Archer 83]], a ten-day [[NATO]] exercise simulating a period of [[conflict escalation]] that culminated in a [[DEFCON 1]] nuclear strike, some members of the [[Soviet]] [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] and [[Soviet Armed Forces|armed forces]] treated the events as a [[ruse of war]] concealing a genuine [[first strike]]. In response, the military prepared for a coordinated counter-attack by readying nuclear forces and placing air units stationed in the [[Warsaw Pact]] states of [[East Germany]] and [[Poland]] under high alert. However, the state of Soviet preparation for retaliation ceased upon completion of the Able Archer exercises.&lt;ref name = "Fischer Conundrum"/&gt;

=== Norwegian rocket incident: 25 January 1995 ===
The [[Norwegian rocket incident]] is the only World War III close call to occur outside the Cold War. This incident occurred when [[Russia]]'s [[Olenegorsk Radar Station|Olenegorsk]] [[early warning radar|early warning station]] accidentally mistook the radar signature from a [[Black Brant (rocket)#Black Brant XII|Black Brant XII]] [[sounding rocket|research rocket]] (being jointly launched by Norwegian and US scientists from [[Andøya Rocket Range]]), as appearing to be the radar signature of the launch of a [[Trident missile|Trident]] [[SLBM]] missile. In response, [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] was summoned and the ''[[Cheget]]'' [[nuclear briefcase]] was activated for the first and only time. However, the high command was soon able to determine that the rocket was not entering Russian airspace, and promptly aborted plans for combat readiness and retaliation. It was retrospectively determined that, while the rocket scientists had informed thirty states including Russia about the test launch, the information had not reached Russian radar technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eucom.mil/article/23042/this-week-in-eucom-history-january-23-29-1995|title=January 25, 1995—The Norwegian Rocket Incident|publisher=United States European Command|date=23 January 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921003744/http://www.eucom.mil/article/23042/this-week-in-eucom-history-january-23-29-1995|archivedate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/coldwar/shatter031598a.htm|title=Cold-War Doctrines Refuse to Die|first=David|last=Hoffman|publisher=Washington Post Foreign Service|date=15 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extended usage of the term==

===Cold War===
In 2004, neoconservative commentator [[Norman Podhoretz]] proposed that the [[Cold War]] might rightly be called World War III.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/world-war-iv-how-it-started-what-it-means-and-why-we-have-to-win/ Norman Podhoretz:''World War IV: How It Started, What It Means, and Why We Have to Win'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 on [[CNBC]]'s ''[[The Kudlow Report|Kudlow and Company]],'' host [[Lawrence Kudlow]], discussing a book by former deputy Under-Secretary of Defense [[Jed Babbin]], agreed with Podhoretz, adding, "World War IV is the terror war, and war with China would be World War V."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamatters.org/research/2006/07/14/right-wing-media-divided-is-us-now-in-world-war/136176 Right-wing media divided: Is U.S. now in World War III, IV, or V? | Media Matters for America]. Mediamatters.org (14 July 2006). Retrieved on 26 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still the majority of historians would seem to hold that World War III would necessarily have to be a worldwide ''"war in which large forces from many countries fought"'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/world-war Definition of "World War": Cambridge Dictionary] Cambridge University Press.

Downloaded 21 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Secret Weapons of the Cold War'', Bill Yenne explains that the military standoff that occurred between the two 'Superpowers', namely the United States and the Soviet Union, from the 1940s through to 1991, was only the [[Cold War]], which ultimately helped to enable mankind to avert the possibility of an all out nuclear confrontation, and that it certainly was not World War III itself.&lt;ref&gt;Yenne, Bill.

===War on Terror===
The so-called "[[War on Terror]]" that began with the [[September 11 attack]]s has been claimed by some to be World War III&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/01/24/are-we-already-fighting-world-war-iii.html|title=Are We Already Fighting World War III?|first=Sean|last=OMelveny|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/723472/WW3-started-9-11-Twin-Towers-terror-attack-ex-chief-blasts|title=We're ALREADY at war: WW3 started on 9/11 with Twin Towers terror attack, ex-chief blasts|first=Lizzie|last=Stromme|date=20 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes as World War IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/world-war-iv-how-it-started-what-it-means-and-why-we-have-to-win/|title=World War IV: How It Started, What It Means, and Why We Have to Win - Commentary Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have disparaged such claims as "distorting American history." While there is general agreement amongst historians regarding the definitions and extent of the first two world wars, namely due to the unmistakable global scale of aggression and self-destruction of these two wars, a few have claimed that a "World War" might now no longer require such worldwide and large scale aggression and carnage. Still, such claims of a new "lower threshold of aggression," that might now be sufficient to qualify a war as a "World War" have not gained such widespread acceptance and support as the definitions of the first two world wars have received amongst historians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-op-beinart9dec09-story.html Is this really World War IV?] Los Angeles Times.

====War on ISIL====
On 1 February 2015, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iraq)|Iraqi Foreign Minister]] [[Ibrahim al-Jaafari]] declared that the [[Military intervention against ISIL|War on ISIL]] was effectively "World War III", due to ISIL's declaration of a [[Worldwide Caliphate]], its aims to conquer the world, and its success in spreading the conflict to multiple countries outside of the [[Levant]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/video/2015/02/01/fight-against-islamic-state-is-world-war?videoId=363066236 "Fight against Islamic State is World War 3 – Iraqi foreign minister"] Reuters, video&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[2016 State of the Union Address|State of the Union Address]] on 12 January 2016, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] warned that news reports granting ISIL the supposed ability to foment WW III might be excessive and irresponsible, stating that, "as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Obama|first1=Barak|title=2016 State of the Union Address|url=https://medium.com/@WhiteHouse/president-obama-s-2016-state-of-the-union-address-7c06300f9726#.6rytyu7a2|website=The White House|publisher=government of the United States of America|accessdate=9 February 2016|date=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple small wars as a "third war"===
In multiple recorded interviews under somewhat casual circumstances, comparing the conflagrations of World War I and II to the ongoing lower intensity wars of the 21st century, [[Pope Francis]] has said, "The world is at war, ''because it has lost peace''," and "perhaps one can speak of a third war, one fought piecemeal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/07/28/world/social-issues-world/pope-says-world-war-lost-peace-religion-not-blame/#.WJeFnes76rU Pope says ‘world at war because it has lost peace’ but religion not to blame]  Japan Times. 28 July 2016.

==Views on the likely outcome and definition==
In 1949, after the unleashing of nuclear weaponry at the end of WWII, physicist [[Albert Einstein]] suggested that any outcome of a possible WWIII would be so dire as to revert mankind back to the [[Stone Age]]. When asked by journalist Alfred Werner, what types of weapons Einstein believed World War III might be fought with, Einstein warned, "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7406337/#.WmyV55OdU3g |title=The culture of Einstein |last=Johnson |first=M.

In his book ''Destined for War'', [[Graham Allison]] views the global rivalry between the established power, the US, and the rising power, China, as an example of the [[Thucydides Trap]]. Past examples have often led to war, and in this case World War Three is possible but not inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Allison, ''Destined for War'', Scribe, 2017, p 215&lt;/ref&gt;
