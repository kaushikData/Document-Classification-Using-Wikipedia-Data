      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33917">[[Image:National Artist of the Philippines.svg|right|thumb|Insignia of the Order of National Artists]]
The '''2009 National Artist of the Philippines controversy''' refers to the controversial proclamation as [[National Artists of the Philippines]] of four individuals via the Presidential prerogative of [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], when the four had not been nominated by the selection committee, composed of representatives from [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts (Philippines)|National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] (NCCA) and the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] (CCP).&lt;ref name="firstreaction"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kristine L. Alave, Bayani San Diego Jr |title=Palace choices of 4 nat’l artists protested |journal=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=August 1, 2009 |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090801-218247/Palace-choices-of-4-natl-artists-protested |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ipXospc6?url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090801-218247/Palace-choices-of-4-natl-artists-protested |archivedate=August 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GMA7"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Annie Ruth C. Sabangan| title=Fury over Arroyo’s choice of national artists| journal=GMANews.tv: The Official Website of GMA News and Public Affairs| date=2009-08-01| url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/168807/Fury-over-Arroyos-choice-of-national-artist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title [[National Artist of the Philippines]] is given to a [[Philippines|Filipino]] who has been given the highest recognition for having made significant contributions to the development of Philippine arts, namely, [[Music]], [[Dance]], [[Theater]], [[Visual Arts]], [[Literature]], [[Film]], [[Broadcasting|Broadcast Arts]], [[Fashion design|Fashion Design]] and [[Architecture]], and Allied Arts.  Such Filipinos are announced, by virtue of a Presidential Proclamation, as ''National Artist'', having been conferred membership in the Order of National Artists.  Benefits they enjoy from then on include a monthly pension, medical and life insurance, arrangements for a state funeral, a place of honor at national state functions, and recognition at cultural events.&lt;ref name="GMA7"/&gt;

On July 16, 2013, the controversy finally ended after the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] voted 12-1-2 that voided the four proclamations created by former President [[Gloria Arroyo]] that made these people National Artists.&lt;ref name="jul2013" /&gt;

==Controversy==

===President’s prerogative===
The controversy began when  conferred the Order of National Artists to seven individuals in July, 2009.&lt;ref name="announcement"&gt;{{cite journal|author=TJ Burgonio |title=Arroyo names 7 National Artists for ‘09 |journal=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=July 29, 2009 |url=http://services.inquirer.net/mobile/09/07/29/html_output/xmlhtml/20090729-217787-xml.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ipXoRVMW?url=http://services.inquirer.net/mobile/09/07/29/html_output/xmlhtml/20090729-217787-xml.html |archivedate=August 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Controversy arose from the revelation that musician [[Ramon Santos]] had been dropped from the list of nominees short-listed in May that year by the selection committee, and four other individuals had been nominated to the title via "President’s prerogative":&lt;ref name="firstreaction"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GMA7"/&gt;
*[[Cecille Guidote-Alvarez]] (Theater),
*[[Magno Jose "Carlo” Caparas]] (Visual Arts and Film),
*[[Francisco Mañosa]] (Architecture), and
*[[Jose “Pitoy” Moreno]] (Fashion Design)

Members of the Philippine art community, including a number of living National Artists of the Philippines, protested that the proclamation politicized the title of National artist, and made it "a way for President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to accommodate her allies."&lt;ref name="firstreaction"/&gt;

Film director [[Eddie Romero]], himself a National Artist for Film and the Broadcast Arts, explained in an interview that the rules allow the President to pick a National Artist.  He noted, however, that:&lt;ref name="firstreaction"/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;“''It seems it’s the first time the presidential prerogative was used to declare four artists. It’s like a wholesale declaration''.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

National Artist for literature chairman of the [[Concerned Artists of the Philippines]] [[Bienvenido Lumbera]], said&lt;ref name="firstreaction"/&gt; that in the 2009 nominations, there was &lt;blockquote&gt;“''heavy campaigning because the government wanted to ensure the selection of four people.''”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, specific protests were raised regarding the nomination of NCCA executive director Guidote-Alvarez, because it was purportedly a breach of protocol and propriety, and of Carlo Caparas, because protestors assert that he is not qualified to be nominated under either the "Visual Arts" or "Film" categories in which he was proclaimed to the order.&lt;ref name="firstreaction"/&gt;

====Alvarez====
Lumbera, who happened to be a member of the combined “final selection committee" of the NCAA and CCP, noted that:&lt;ref name="firstreaction"/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;“''It was Cecile Guidote-Alvarez, as executive director of the NCCA, who had insisted on the President’s right to add names that were not discussed in the committee.''”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Calling the situation "outrageous",&lt;ref name="firstreaction"/&gt; he said that:&lt;ref name="firstreaction"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GMA7"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“''She should have not allowed herself to be named as national artist. She’s close to the President. Nobody in the committee thought that she deserved to be named.''"&lt;/blockquote&gt; Alvarez heads the NCAA secretariat that receives nominations for national artists.

====Caparas====
Complaints regarding Caparas' proclamation centered on the complaints that he did not illustrate the comic books he wrote and therefore did not meet the qualifications for being honored under the visual arts category,&lt;ref name="firstreaction"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alanguilan"/&gt; and the assertion of protesting artists that his work in the category of Film is supposedly "sub-par", being largely [[exploitation film]]s: "''pito-pito''" ("seven-seven") films rush-finished in seven days, and "massacre films" whose focus was sensational crimes.&lt;ref name="CCPprotest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="firstreaction"/&gt;&lt;ref name="palace"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lourd"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spot.ph/2009/08/01/carlo-j-all-the-way/ |title=Carlo J. All the Way |accessdate=2009-08-03 |publisher=www.spot.ph |year=2009 |author=Lourd Ernest de Veyra |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ipXsfUYy?url=http://www.spot.ph/2009/08/01/carlo-j-all-the-way/ |archivedate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bienvenido Lumbera remarked that Caparas’ nomination was twice rejected by two NCAA panels:&lt;ref name="GMA7"/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;“''&lt;nowiki&gt;[Caparas]&lt;/nowiki&gt; was first proposed as a nominee for literature, but the committee rejected him. He was again proposed as nominee for visual artist but the panel again turned him down.''"&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Film Academy of the Philippines]] director general [[Leo Martinez]]&lt;ref name="GMA7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martinez"/&gt; noted that "''He was obviously added by Malacañang''." Caparas is known as a vocal supporter of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.&lt;ref name="palace"/&gt;

===Committee-shortlisted nominees===
Protestors, however, were careful to note that three of the individuals proclaimed as National Artist in 2009&lt;ref name="announcement"/&gt; were in fact recommended by the selection committee:&lt;ref name="firstreaction"/&gt;
*Manuel Urbano a.k.a. [[Manuel Conde]] (Film and Broadcast),
*[[Lazaro Francisco]] (Literature), and
*[[Federico Aguilar Alcuaz]] (Visual Arts, Painting, Sculpture and Mixed Media).

=== Non-inclusion of Ramon Santos ===
Protesters also lamented the dropping of musician Ramon Santos from the list of new National Artists.  Philippine entertainment news website PEP says that a CCP official, who had asked not to be named, revealed that Santos actually won the most number of votes during the selection process. Lumbera verbalized dismay about the snubbing of Santos, saying:&lt;ref name="PEPbypass"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/22724/CCP:-Malaca%C3%B1ang-bypassed-rules-of-the-selection-process-for-National-Artists/1/2 |title=CCP: Malacañang bypassed rules of the selection process for National Artists |accessdate=2009-08-13 |publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal |date=2009-08-04 |author=Mark Angelo Ching |work=PEP.ph |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5j22n5uEu?url=http://www.pep.ph/news/22724/CCP%3A-Malaca%C3%B1ang-bypassed-rules-of-the-selection-process-for-National-Artists/1/2 |archivedate=2009-08-14 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"What makes this even more outrageous is that Ramon Santos, who received a good number of votes in the panel selection, was dropped from the list. The basis for him being scrapped, one doesn't know" &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same report that quoted Lumbera also noted that "Santos still has not spoken about the whole brouhaha up to this day.&lt;nowiki&gt;[August 4, 2009]&lt;/nowiki&gt;"&lt;ref name="PEPbypass"/&gt;

=== Malacañang Honors Committee ===
Another aspect of the controversy regards the existence and of the Palace Honors committee which allegedly prepared the final list of nominees, which was eventually enacted by Arroyo.

Protesters claim that they were not aware of the existence of such a committee, and that at first, they had no idea who precisely were supposed to be on the committee.&lt;ref name="sept15houseA"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gil C. Cabacungan Jr. |title=NATIONAL ARTISTS ROW:Existence of Palace honors body questioned |journal=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=2009-09-14 |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090914-225224/Existence-of-Palace-honors-body-questioned |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jrU45eBv?url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090914-225224/Existence-of-Palace-honors-body-questioned |archivedate=2009-09-17 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, nominating committees were made by the CCP and NCCA, and a final list of nominees was prepared by a joint committee.  NCCA sub-commission on the arts head Ricardo de Ungria, one of the panelists involved in the selection process, insisted before a congressional committee meeting on the matter that the arts community “''were never apprised of the existence of this animal since the start of the selection process this year or eight years ago.''”&lt;ref name="sept15houseB"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gil C. Cabacungan Jr., Norman Bordadora |title=Forgery alleged in picking Nat’l Artists: CCP exec says Palace honors panel never met |journal=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=2009-09-15 |page=2 |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090915-225281/Forgery-alleged-in-picking-Natl-Artists |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jrU3agRL?url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090915-225281/Forgery-alleged-in-picking-Natl-Artists |archivedate=2009-09-17 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Malacañang and to Cecille Guidote-Alvarez,however, the selection process had always involved the participation of three committees - those of the CCP, the NCCA and the Malacañang honors committee, whose head was Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita.&lt;ref name="sept15houseB"/&gt;

==Defense==

===Arroyo Administration===
The Arroyo administration was quick to defend its choices of individuals to be named to the Order of National Artists. Acting Executive Secretary and Presidential political adviser Gabriel Claudio told reporters that:&lt;ref name="palace"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/168769/Palace-defends-Carlo-Js-inclusion-in-National-Artist-award|title=Palace defends Carlo J's inclusion in National Artist award|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=GMA News and Public Affairs|year=2009|author=GMA News TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"''&lt;nowiki&gt;I think we can defend [their] track record and qualifications and reasons [for their selection]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.''”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He also said the administration would “''stand by the qualifications, qualities, track record and reputation of those named as National Artists.''&lt;ref name="palace"/&gt;”

===Carlo J. Caparas===
Caparas defended his proclamation, saying that other aspirants to the honor ought to wait their turn.&lt;ref name="CaparasABS"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/07/31/09/caparas-airs-side-natl-artist-award |title=Caparas airs side on Nat'l Artist Award |accessdate=2009-08-05 |publisher=ABS-CBN News Online |year=2009 |author=Boy Villasanta |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ippY7Co3?url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/07/31/09/caparas-airs-side-natl-artist-award |archivedate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“''Ganyan talaga kung may something for grabs. E, iisa lang ang pipiliin. Sana, maghintay na lang sila ng tamang panahon sa gusto nilang manalo. Hindi naman ito palakasan.''”(That's the way it is whenever something is for grabs.  Only one person can be selected.  They ought to wait for the right time for them if they want to win.  It's not as if this were a case of sucking up.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Kaya wag mag-alala ang mga critics ko, may pagkakataon pa sila o ang mga manok nila na manalo in the future.'' (So my critics shouldn't worry, they or their [[fighting cocks]] still have opportunities to win in the future.) They cannot take the award from me anymore.''"&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“''Baka ang nasa isip nila ay bata pa ako. Pero hindi naman ‘yon ang basehan. Sino naman ang ko-contest sa decision ng Cultural Center, ng NCCA at ng Malacañang tungkol sa award na ito? Mabuti na nga at ngayon pa lang ay ibinibigay na ang ganitong award sa mga taong nandito. Ang akala kasi nila ay sa matatanda o sa beterano o sa mga patay na ibinibigay ang ganitong award.''” (Maybe they think I'm too young.  But that's not a valid basis &lt;nowiki&gt;[for a choice]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Who would contest the decision of the Cultural Center, the NCCA, and Malacañang regarding this award? It's a good thing they're giving this award to someone who's still here.  They think awards like this should only be given to the old, to veterans, or to the dead.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Caparas said that instead of criticizing his award, entertainment people “''should unite and work together to revive the ailing movie and komiks industry.''”&lt;ref name="CaparasABS"/&gt;  He attributed his win to the fact that he managed to cross over from comic books to film and television, and saying that his triumph was significant because he was a National Artist who came from the working class.  “''I am a National Artist who came from the masses,''" the [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] quoted him as saying. "''I work and struggle with them.''” He said it was time for a National Artist “w''ho the masses can identify with—someone who walks beside them, someone who can inspire them.''” Noting that some Filipinos did not even know the National Artists he said “''Hopefully, since I am still active in TV and in the movies, this will encourage our countrymen to learn more about our National Artists.''”&lt;ref name="firstreaction"/&gt;

Others who have come to his defense include Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) director and former [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]] (MTRCB) chief [[Manoling Morato]],  [[Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption]] (VACC) head [[Dante Jimenez]], boxer [[Manny Pacquiao]], Senators [[Ramon Revilla Jr.]] and [[Jinggoy Estrada]], [[Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino]] chair Joe Lad Santos, and [[Polytechnic University of the Philippines]] president Dante Guevarra.&lt;ref name="MORATO"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jerry E.

===Cecilla Guidote-Alvarez===
Guidote-Alvarez also defended her qualifications for receiving the award.  “''Before you make a judgment,''" she said, "''read my achievements first as an artist. Was I an idiot before I became a national artist?''"&lt;ref name="GMA7"/&gt;  As proof of her achievements, she cited previous awards, including the Ramon Magsaysay public service award for the arts, the CCP Gawad Sining Award for Literature, and the Outstanding Women in the Nation's Services award.&lt;ref name="GMA7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="firm"/&gt;  She also cited her important role in the development of Philippine theater, having founded the [[Philippine Educational Theatre Association]] (PETA) in 1967.&lt;ref name="firm"&gt;{{cite journal| author=TJ Burgonio| title=Palace firm on choices of National Artists| journal=Philippine Daily Inquirer| date=2009-08-05| url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20090805-218878/Palace-firm-on-choices-of-National-Artists| access-date=2009-08-06| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807045230/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20090805-218878/Palace-firm-on-choices-of-National-Artists| archive-date=2009-08-07| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She asserted that the President had the prerogative to name national artists who were not named in the selection committee's shortlist, and denied lobbying for the award, saying that President Arroyo had “''never talked to'' [her]'' about it.''"&lt;ref name="GMA7"/&gt;

==Significant events==
On July 27, 2009, it was announced to the public that President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo had named seven National Artists for 2009: National Commission on Culture and the Arts executive director Cecille Guidote Alvarez (theater); Manuel Conde (film and broadcast arts, posthumous); Lazaro Francisco (literature, posthumous); Federico Aguilar Alcuaz (visual arts in painting, sculpture and mixed media); Magno Jose Carlo Caparas (visual arts and film); Francisco Mañoza (architecture); and Jose "Pitoy" Moreno (fashion design).&lt;ref name="announcement"/&gt;

By August 1, 2009, it had been revealed by members of the final selection committee, comprising members from the NCCA and CCP, that only Conde, Alcuaz and Francisco had been short-listed by the selection committee in May. Alvarez, Caparas,Mañosa, and Moreno had been included via what was referred to as the "President’s prerogative".  They also revealed that a fourth nominee, Ramon Santos (shortlisted for music), had not been conferred the order as recommended by committee – also supposedly part of the president's prerogative.  Various artists' groups in the Philippines began to protest, notably the [[Concerned Artists of the Philippines]].  Over the next few days, previously conferred members of the Order of National Artists, notably Eddie Romero, F. Sionil Jose, Bienvenido Lumbera, Virgilio Almario, and BenCab&lt;ref name="firstreaction"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GMA7"/&gt; A number of members of the Comic Book industry, notably [[Gerry Alanguilan]], also protested.&lt;ref name="Alanguilan"/&gt;

=== Reactions ===

On August 6, Representatives [[Ana Theresia Hontiveros]] and [[Walden Bello]] of the [[Akbayan]] Party-list filed House Resolution 1305 at the [[Philippine House of Representatives]], calling for a congressional inquiry into the controversy to make sure that the choice of national artists would not be subject to the “whims" of ranking government officials. Hontiveros noted:&lt;ref name="Hontiveros"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/169190/House-probe-looms-over-National-Artist-awards-mess|title=House probe looms over National Artist awards mess|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=GMA News and Public Affairs|date=2009-08-06|author=Johanna Camille L. Sisante|work=GMANews.TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"Choosing national artists should fundamentally be about contribution in the arts and culture, not patronage or closeness to Malacañang. Choosing eminent symbols of Filipino arts and culture should be left in the hands of the arts community."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also on August 15, the [[ABS CBN News Channel]] (ANC) hosted an episode of [[Cheche Lazaro]]'s Media in Focus, in which the controversial awardees in the person of Caparas and Alavarez were supposed to face off with protesting artists in the person of National Artist Eddie Romero, CCP Chair [[Emily Abrera]], [[Palanca Award]] Hall of Fame Awardee [[Butch Dalisay]], and film critic [[Alexis Tioseco]].  The first segment of the show allowed Caparas and Dalisay to air their side, while Alvarez was unable to arrive in time to join the second part of a show, which would have had her on a panel with Romero and Abrera, who were protesting the circumstances of her proclamation to the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Corruption of Culture? | episodelink =  | series = Media in Focus | serieslink =  | airdate = 2008-08-06 | season =  | number = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On '''August 7''', protesters gathered at the front ramp of the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] for a major protest action in the form of a mock “necrological service”.  National Artists who joined the protesters were [[Napoleon Abueva]] (visual arts), [[Arturo Luz]] (visual arts), [[Ben Cabrera]] (visual arts), [[F. Sionil Jose]] (literature), [[Bienvenido Lumbera]] (literature), [[Virgilio Almario]] (literature) and [[Salvador Bernal]] (theater design).  Relatives of deceased National Artists also participated in the event, with singer [[Celeste Legaspi]] representing her late father [[Cesar Legaspi]] (National Artist for visual arts), and Raul Locsin representing his late brother [[Leandro Locsin]] (National Artist for architecture).  Protesters offered black roses "to symbolize the death of the National Artist Awards."&lt;ref name="Mournersl"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rhodina Villanueva | title=National artists unite vs selection irregularities  | journal=The Philippine Star | date=2009-08-08| page=1| url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=494082&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the protests, the Concerned Artists of the Philippines group, through its chair Lumbera informed the media that they “might seek court injunction" at the Supreme Court "against the proclamation of the new national artists."&lt;ref name="sc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/169329/Natl-artist-controversy-may-up-end-up-in-SC|title=Nat'l artist controversy may end up in SC|date=2009-08-08|publisher=GMANews.TV|accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the mock ceremony, participants continued the protest with a motorcade which ended at the offices of the NCCA, where Alvarez serves as head. This led to loud verbal confrontations between protesters and supporters of Alvarez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090807-219189/Shouting-match-erupts-in-artists-protest |title=Shouting match erupts in artists protest |last=Torres |first=Tetch |date=2009-08-07 |publisher=INQUIRER.net |accessdate=2009-08-13 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5j0v7Szm5?url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090807-219189/Shouting-match-erupts-in-artists-protest |archivedate=2009-08-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Petition with the Supreme Court ===

On '''August 19''' a group of National Artists and supporters, led by National Artists for Literature Bienvenido Lumbera and Virgilio Almario, asked filed a 38-page petition at the Supreme Court "for prohibition, certiorari and injunction with prayer for restraining order to prevent the Palace from conferring the title to respondents," to stop "the release of the monetary benefits, entitlements and emoluments… to private respondents arising from such conferment," and the "holding of the acknowledgement ceremonies for their recognition."&lt;ref name="SCpetition"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/08/19/09/sc-asked-stop-awards-caparas-et-al |title=SC asked to stop awards for Caparas et al |accessdate=2009-08-19 |publisher=abs-cbnNEWS.com |date=2009-08-19 |author=Trina Lagura |work=abs-cbn NEWS |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jcEebyni?url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/08/19/09/sc-asked-stop-awards-caparas-et-al |archivedate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The petition asserted that:&lt;blockquote&gt; "For the President to cavalierly disregard the collective judgment of the CCP and NCCA boards, and substitute her own judgment without a clear indication of the reasons and bases, therefore, is an unacceptable and manifestly grave abuse of discretion." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

On '''August 25''' the Supreme Court issued a status quo order, stopping Malacañang from conferring the honor pending deliberation of the petition to disqualify Alvarez, Caparas, Mañosa, and Moreno. Supreme Court spokesman Jose Midas Marquez noted that: "The court saw the urgency to issue the status quo order and stop the conferment of the awards. It has the same {{sic|affect}} as a temporary restraining order."&lt;ref name="statusquo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/08/25/09/sc-stops-natl-artist-awards |title=SC stops conferment of Nat'l Artist awards |accessdate=2009-08-25 |publisher=ABS-CBNnews.com |date=2009-08-25 |work=ABS CBN News Online Beta |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jcEf3XhZ?url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/08/25/09/sc-stops-natl-artist-awards |archivedate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident involving Caparas has also been the subject of vandalism in [[Wikipedia]], where anonymous editors and newly registered accounts maliciously edited the article, substituting the titles with nonsensical ones containing [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] [[pejorative]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.efrenefren.com/2009/08/ang-mahiwagang-titi-sa-noo-part-1-and-2.html Blog entry detailing the Caparas vandalism incident]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On '''August 31, 2009''', Dalisay claimed in his column in ''[[The Philippine Star]]'' that the NCCA web page regarding the selection process for national artists had been changed:&lt;ref name="Tampering"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Butch Dalisay |authorlink=Butch Dalisay |title=PENMAN: Tampering with the evidence |journal=The Philippine Star |date=2009-08-31 |url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=500855 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jjqDfyuc?url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=500855 |archivedate=2009-09-12 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When I looked up the National Artists page on the NCCA website, the rules had suddenly changed — now there was a mention of Executive Order 236 empowering an Honors Committee to make up its own list of NA nominees to the President. That wasn’t there before the recent [National Artist] scandal blew up — neither the rule nor the role of the committee in the NAA process.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On '''September 14, 2009''', the Philippines' [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] began its committee inquiry into the National Artist controversy.  In her testimony before the committee, CCP director and lawyer [[Lorna Kapunan]] alleged that the Malacañang honors committee had not actually held a meeting to deliberate on the nominees, and that minutes of the said meeting were therefore forged.  Alvarez denied the allegations, and insisted that the selection process for National Artists of the Philippines had always involved the participation of three committees – those of the CCP, the NCCA and the Malacañang honors committee.&lt;ref name="sept15houseA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sept15houseB"/&gt;

On the same day, the CCP submitted to the Supreme Court its 31-page comment regarding the petition to disqualify the National Artists added by Malacañang to the list of nominees.  The CCP reiterated its position that the four had not been in the original list of nominees. It also requested the Supreme Court to order the proclamation of its four original choices as 2009's National Artists.&lt;ref name="sept14SupremeCourt"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Norman Bordadora| title=Allow 4 nat’l artists’ proclamation, SC asked| journal=Philippine Daily Inquirer| date=2009-09-14| url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090914-225195/Allow-4-natl-artists-proclamation-SC-asked| access-date=2009-09-15| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922191704/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090914-225195/Allow-4-natl-artists-proclamation-SC-asked| archive-date=2009-09-22| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aftermath ===

On '''July 16, 2013''', the Supreme Court voided former President Arroyo's proclamations awarding National Artists to Alvarez, Caparas, Mañosa and Moreno, four years after the said proclamations. Arroyo inserted these names although they were not part of the recommendations created by the Cultural Center of the Philippines and the National Commission on Culture and Arts. The original nominees were [[Lazaro Francisco|Lazaro Francisco]] (literature), Dr. Ramon Santos (music), [[Manuel Conde]] (film and broadcast) and [[Federico Aguilar Alcuaz]] (visual arts, painting, sculpture and mixed media). The justices voted 12-1-2 that struck down the 4 proclamations.&lt;ref name="jul2013"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mark Merueñas| title=SC voids National Artist Award on Carlo Caparas, 3 others| journal=[[GMA News and Public Affairs]]| date=2013-07-16| url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/317670/news/nation/sc-voids-national-artist-award-on-carlo-caparas-3-others}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 2014, Dr. Ramon Santos was named as one of six new National Artists.&lt;ref name="2014-national-artists"&gt;[http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/163632/palace-declares-new-national-artists-nora-aunor-didnt-make-it Palace declares new National Artists, Nora Aunor didn't make it].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3223">'''''Disputatio inter clericum et militem''''' ('''''A Dispute Between a Priest and a Knight''''') is a dialogue, written in France between 1296 and 1303. Although anonymous, it could have been [[John of Paris]], master of the [[University of Paris]]. The treatise examines the relationship between [[Separation of church and state (medieval)|Church and King]] through a fictional dialogue between a Priest and a Knight. 

It was written during the period of the acrimonious dispute between King [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] and Pope [[Boniface VIII]], which culminated in the Papal bull ''[[Unam sanctam]]'' of 1302. It is essentially propaganda. The furious reaction of Philip and his ministry expressed in the ''Disputatio'' (written in simple language for a popular audience) can be understood within the context of a conflict between the increasing power of secular rulers in France and England, who were attempting to tax the clergy to support warfare. Boniface's stringent reaction was the fierce bull ''[[Clericis laicos]]'' of 1296, which set off the dispute. The dialogue can be fitted into the context of the debate over the extent of church powers that was raging in the time delimited by the two bulls.

However, the work remained unknown in its own time and was not published until 1378. A translation by [[John Trevisa]] (1342-1402) was popular in England because of its antipapalism, and it continued to be popular in the 16th century for similar reasons.

In the story the knight and priest exchange rapid fire and simple dialogue designed to reach a broad audience. The knight's intention is to prove that soft-living wealthy clerics, who have more money than needed, should hand the extra income over to secular leaders, whose job it is to deal in more earthly affairs. Specifically it is the job of secular leaders to protect the Church from outside threats, and the Church must pay the nobles for their own protection. Within the realm of the kingdom, kings have ultimate authority over all matters and the Church must obey the right of the king to tax the Church for the purpose of protection. If it refuses, the king may seize Church property.

''Disputatio'' was a sharp criticism of the church and foreshadowed further 14th century arguments that pitted royalist national sovereignty against the principles of [[papal supremacy]].

John of Paris also wrote a related work entitled "On Royal and Papal Power" about the autonomous nature of kingdoms, an early expression of the concept of sovereignty.

The '''Animal Wall''' ({{lang-cy|Mur Anifeiliaid}}) is a sculptured wall depicting 15 animals in the [[Castle Quarter]] of the [[Cardiff city centre|city centre]] of [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]].  It is a Grade I [[Listed building|listed]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-21696-animal-wall-and-gates-near-clock-tower-ca|title=Animal Wall, and Gates near Clock Tower, Castle|work=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Animal Wall Cardiff.jpg|left|thumb|The Animal Wall in front of [[Cardiff Castle]] (''c.'' 1890)]] 
The Animal Wall was designed by [[William Burges]] in 1866, but it was not built until 1890, after  Burges's death in 1881. The work of the restoration of [[Cardiff Castle]] and the building of the Animal Wall for the [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute|Marquess of Bute]], was continued by his former assistant [[William Frame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cardiffcastle.com/past/timeline.htm Cardiff Castle timeline] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222202520/http://www.cardiffcastle.com/past/timeline.htm |date=December 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original nine animal figures were sculptured by [[Thomas Nicholls (sculptor)|Thomas Nicholls]], they were the hyena, wolf, baboons, seal, bear, lioness, lynx, and 2 different lions. They were painted in naturalistic colours, although since then the paint work on the sculptures has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/southeastwales/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8789000/8789652.stm Cardiff Castle's animal wall under repair]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Date"&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/06/24/do-you-nose-how-castle-sculpture-used-to-look-91466-23959625/ Do you nose how castle sculpture used to look?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011034406/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/06/24/do-you-nose-how-castle-sculpture-used-to-look-91466-23959625/ |date=October 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wall was moved about {{convert|50|m|ft}} from outside Cardiff Castle to its present location outside [[Bute Park]] in 1922, due to road widening in front of the castle in Duke Street and Castle Street (now the [[A4161 road|A4161]]). 

In 1931 a further six animals were added; the pelican, ant-eater, raccoons, leopard, beaver and vulture.&lt;ref name="Date"/&gt; They were all sculptured by Alexander Carrick.&lt;ref name="Date"/&gt; 

The original nine, sculpted by Thomas Nicholls, had glass eyes and were painted in naturalistic colours to make them seem even more lifelike. But the paint peeled after a couple of years and was never replaced, leaving the bare stone seen today.

The animals reached the peak of their popularity in the 1930s when the South Wales Echo ran a children’s cartoon strip – the Keepers of the Wall – that depicted them involved in adventures around the city.

Penned by Dorothy Howard Rowlands characters included William the seal, Priscilla the pelican, Martha and Oscar the monkeys; however, the statues are actually baboons. Larry the lynx and Romulus and Remus the two lions.

The inside of the castle also features animals carved in stone, including many lions, as these were a symbol of Lord Bute’s family.

In the 1970s Council planners had wanted to demolish the Animal Wall to widen the Castle Street again, but this idea was later abandoned.&lt;ref name="Date"/&gt;

As part of a £5.6 million refurbishment of [[Bute Park]], restoration of the animals began in July 2010. During the repair, the anteater's nose, which has been missing since the late 90s, was replaced as well as the missing glass eyes in the nine original animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-news/2010/07/07/animals-watching-from-the-wall-get-a-makeover-91466-26800631/ WalesOnline | Work starts on Bute Park 'Animal Wall']&lt;/ref&gt; This work was completed in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?nav%3D2868%2C4407%2C4413%2C5511%2C5625%26parent_directory_id%3D2865 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926154756/http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?nav=2868%2C4407%2C4413%2C5511%2C5625&amp;parent_directory_id=2865 |archivedate=2012-09-26 |df= }}[[Cardiff Council]] | HLF (Heritage Lottery Fund) Bute Park Restoration Project{{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Atomic Mom''''' is a 2010 [[documentary film]] written and directed by M.T Silvia about the complex experiences of two women struggling with the emotional repercussions of their connections to the nuclear bombings on [[Hiroshima]], Japan, at the end of [[World War II]] in August 1945.

==Director==

M.T. Silvia graduated from Rogers High School in 1974, and spent the majority of the 1980s as an activist in the [[anti-nuclear movement]].&lt;ref name="Facing the fallout "&gt;Flynn, Sean.

==Synopsis==

''Atomic Mom'' is a documentary film written and directed by M.T Silvia, which focuses on the connection between two mothers that are each on a different end of the Hiroshima atomic warfare spectrum: Pauline Silvia, a United States Navy biologist, and one of the only women scientists present during the 1953 radiation detonations of [[Operation Upshot–Knothole]] at the then-Nevada Test Site, and Emiko Okada, a Japanese woman who was exposed to radiation from the [[Hiroshima]] nuclear bombings as a child.&lt;ref name="Kris Kosaka"&gt;Kosaka, Kris.

Tokyo: NewsBank, 10 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Atomic Mom also offers a comparison of the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]] and the Atomic Testing Museum in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].&lt;ref name="Facing the fallout" /&gt; Through the use of numerous interviews with Japanese doctors, historians and Hiroshima survivors, M.T Silvia discusses matters of censorship, value of scientific innovation, human rights, personal responsibility and the prospect of world peace in the aftermath of Hiroshima.&lt;ref name="Women Make Movies"&gt;Women Make Movies. “M.T.

Normally two identical dye samples are created. One is placed in the dark as the [[Scientific control|control]] and the other is placed in the equivalent of sunlight for a three-month period. A standard bluewool textile fading test card is also placed in the same light conditions as the sample under test.
The amount of fading of the sample is then assessed by comparison to the original colour.

A rating between 0 and 8 is awarded by identifying which one of the eight strips on the bluewool standard card has faded to the same extent as the sample under test.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;[http://apps.webcreate.com/ecom/catalog/product_specific.cfm?ClientID=15&amp;ProductID=23850 Faded Card example] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225043448/http://apps.webcreate.com/ecom/catalog/product_specific.cfm?ClientID=15&amp;ProductID=23850 |date=December 25, 2010 }}, Talas.

Retrieved 2010-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero denotes extremely poor colour fastness whilst a rating of eight is deemed not to have altered from the original and thus credited as being lightfast and permanent.

The [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation in light is responsible for ink fading. As the intensity of UV radiation differs from place to place, the ink fading also depends on place. It will be more in areas with more UV radiation and vice versa. This difficulty is overcome by the bluewool testing method. Absolute values of fading will depend on light intensity. Relative values of fading, comparing the sample with the standard blue test strip, will depend less on intensity. For example, if a pigment is rated as "BW5" it can be expected to fade to the same degree as strip number 5 on a bluewool test card, for any specific light exposure. The method of comparison between the sample and a test strip enables accelerated testing to be carried out under intense artificial illumination.

'''Broadminded''' was a daily talk and entertainment show on [[SIRIUS XM Satelliete Radio]] Channel 107 – [[Sirius XM Stars]].

It was hosted by real-life friends, [[Christine Eads]] and [[Molly Dedham]]. The hosts refer to themselves as "''Broads''".  They discussed a wide range of topics from sex, men, entertainment, and life in general.  Christine and Molly met at George Mason University in the early 90's and have been best friends ever since.  They often refer to living together in LA, doing random jobs together and even dating the same guy.

The show debuted on &lt;ref&gt;XM Radio&lt;/ref&gt; XM Radio channel 105 &lt;ref&gt;Take 5&lt;/ref&gt; TAKE 5 in October 2005.  The show was originally heard from 8:00 – 10:00 PM evenings eastern time, but was quickly moved to the evening drive time slot, from 5:00 – 8:00 PM Eastern time, due to its popularity with listeners. In September 2007, their timeslot was again moved – this time to the 12:00 – 3:00 PM (EST) slot with encore re-broadcasts at 9:00 PM (EST).

The original Broadminded show consisted of three '''"Broads",''' which included '''Molly, Christine''' and '''[[Shari Elliker]]. Shari's''' last show was on December 21, 2007. '''Jason Moore''', of [[Panacea (group)]] fame, was the well-liked Board Operator (Board Op. for short) for the show and could be heard "chiming in" on the girls' rants from time to time.

After the merger between '''Sirius and XM satetellite radio companies''', '''Broadminded''' went on a hiatus for six weeks in the beginning of 2009, and when they returned on March 17, 2009, to '''Sirius 102 and XM 155 The Stars Channels''' their time was changed to 12:00 – 2:00 PM (EST), with replays 8:00 – 10:00 PM (EST) Monday – Friday.

On November 3, 2009, '''Broadminded''' aired live from 2:00 – 4:00 PM (EST), with replays 10:00 PM – 12:00 AM (EST) Monday – Friday.

As of January 3, 2011, '''Broadminded''' is now live on the morning drive time slot, 8:00 – 10:00 AM (EST).

As of March 2013, the show was cancelled.

== Specialities ==

'''Christine''' is a fan of entertainment and gossip and leads the other broads daily during Broadbuzz. Christine also seems to be the driving force during Ask The Broads/As Tried on Broadminded and The Unbelivable Broads.  Her passion for her charity The Duffy House is now a part of a monthly segment Christine does the second Tuesday of each month to raise awareness about Domestic and Sexual abuse and  Violence.

'''Molly''' is a fan of music and movies, and you will hear a Molly's Music segment every Thursday ranging from singing to the songs of the 80s onto a Tribute to Marvin Gaye. Molly also will give you all the scoop on movies before they hit the theaters and tell you what is worth watching and what to skip at the theaters. Molly will get the 'behind the scenes' interviews with Directors and Actors for your favorite movies.

The opening sequence to their show has recently been changed to reflect these interests.

'''The Broads''' Love American Idol, Bachelor, Bachelorette, Batchelor Pad, True Blood, Dancing With The Stars, Two and a Half Men, Game of Thrones, and you can hear their recaps weekly.

'''The Broads''' also host the Telluride film festival for '''Starz Entertainment TV Channel'''.

'''''Death of the [[Reprobate]]''''' (33.4 x 19.6 cm) is an oil on panel painting by a follower of [[Hieronymus Bosch]] which depicts the deathbed struggle for the human soul between an angel and a demon. The style is somewhat similar to his ''[[Death of the Miser]]''. It is held in a private collection in [[New York City]], United States.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abcgallery.com/B/bosch/bosch31.html |title=Hieronymus Bosch: Death of the Reprobate |date=9 August 2015 |accessdate=9 August 2015 |work=ABC Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is likely a copy of detail from a larger hell panel. It dates from the second half of the 16th century.

A '''dress code''' is a set of written and, more often, [[unwritten rule]]s with regard to [[clothing]]. Clothing, like other aspects of human [[physical appearance]], has a social significance, with different rules and expectations applying depending on circumstance and occasion. Within a single day, an individual may need to navigate between two or more dress codes. For example, many navigate between a home dress code and a work dress code; usually this ability is a result of cultural acclimatization.{{clarify|date=April 2017}} Different societies and cultures will have different dress norms, although [[Western dress codes]] are widely accepted as valid internationally.

The dress code has built in rules or signals indicating the message being given by a person's clothing and how it is worn. This message may include indications of the person's gender, [[income]], occupation and [[social class]], political, ethnic and religious affiliation, [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] towards comfort, fashion, traditions, gender expression, marital status, sexual availability, and sexual orientation, etc. Clothes convey other social messages including the stating or claiming [[Identity (social science)|personal]] or [[cultural identity]], the establishing, maintaining, or defying [[group (sociology)|social group]] [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], and appreciating comfort and functionality.

For example, wearing expensive clothes of high quality can communicate [[wealth]] or the [[image]] of wealth. The observer sees the expensive clothes, but may misinterpret the extent to which these factors apply to the wearer. Clothing can convey a social message, even if none is intended: if the receiver's code of interpretation differs from the sender's code of communication, misinterpretation follows. However clothes may be worn because they are comfortable and practical, not to convey a message.

In every culture, current [[fashion]] governs how clothing is constructed, assembled, and worn to convey a social message. The rate of change of fashion varies, clothes and its accessories within months or days, especially in small social groups or in communications media-influenced modern societies. More extensive changes, requiring more time, money, and effort to effect, may span generations. When fashion changes, the messages communicated by clothing change.

==History==
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}

===Europe===
{{Western dress codes}}
{{See also|Western dress codes|Sumptuary laws}}
In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[:Category:European nobility|European royalty and nobility]] used a dress code to differentiate themselves from other classes of people.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===The Americas===
The [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] had a complex social structure, including slaves, commoners, and nobles, and dress codes to indicate these social distinctions. [[John R. Jewitt]], an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people]] in 1802-1805, describes how, after some time living there, [[Maquinna]] and the chiefs decided that he must now be "considered one of them, and conform to their customs". Jewitt resented the imposition of this dress code, finding the loose untailored garments very cold, and attributed to them a subsequent illness of which he almost died. He was not allowed to cut his hair, and had to paint his face and body as a Nootka would.&lt;ref&gt;''A Narrative of the Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt, only survivor of the crew of the ship Boston, during a captivity of nearly three years among the savages of Nootka Sound: with an account of the manners, mode of living, and religious opinions of the natives.''[http://www.canadiana.org/ECO/mtq?id=328920feff&amp;doc=90038 digital full text here] p161 onwards&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signifier==
[[File:Vatican-tourists-queuing-at-St-Peter-6598.jpg|thumb|A placard informs tourists about the minimum clothing standards for entering [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in the Vatican]]

===Gender===
{{See also|Cross-dressing}}
In most traditions, certain types of clothing are worn exclusively or predominantly by either men or women. For example, long sleeves are common for both genders, and while the wearing of a knee-  
to floor-length [[skirt]] or a knee- to floor-length [[dress]] tends to be associated with female dress, ankle-length [[trousers]] are associated with male dress. [[Hairdressing]] in some societies may also conform to a dress code, such as long hair for women and short hair for men.

===Social status===

[[File:Prokudin-Gorskii-19.jpg|thumb|[[Mohammed Alim Khan|Emir Alim Khan]]'s bemedalled [[robe]] communicates a social message]]

[[File:Ming Dynasty royal attire.jpg|thumb|160px|Formal attire for the Emperor and Empress of the [[Ming Dynasty]] of China&lt;ref&gt;Note that the golden-colored YiShanGuan (翼善冠, lit. 'Winged Crown of Philanthropy') the male model wears is historically incorrect: according to archaeological findings at the Tomb of [[Wanli Emperor]] (明定陵, ''MingDingLing'', lit. 'The Mausoleum of Tranquility of Ming') - the golden version of YiShanGuan was only worn by deceased emperors as part of the burial ritual; a living emperor on the other hand, always wore the YiShanGuan made of black silk with decorative jewels and dragons, therefore a 'black' version of it instead of gold. A historical fact not widely known in modern day China, thus the misrepresentation of the Ming Royal Attire in the photo above.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In many societies, particular clothing may be a [[status symbol]], reserved or affordable to people of high rank. For example, in [[Ancient Rome]] only senators were permitted to wear garments dyed with [[Tyrian purple]]; and, in [[Culture of the Native Hawaiians|traditional Hawaiian]] society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear [[feather cloak]]s and [[palaoa]] or carved whale teeth. In [[China]] before the establishment of the republic, only the emperor could wear yellow.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}{{dubious|date=November 2015}}

In 1996, former U. S. President [[Bill Clinton]] announced his support for the idea of [[school uniform]]s by stating, “School uniforms are one step that may help break the cycle of violence, truancy and disorder by helping young students understand what really counts is what kind of people they are.” Many [[school district]]s in the United States took up the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowen|first=Sherry|title=Should Kids Wear School Uniforms?|url=http://www.eduguide.org/article/should-kids-wear-school-uniforms|publisher=EduGuide|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By requiring students to wear a school [[uniform]] they are less likely to have something to make fun of other students for. This would cause the students to get to know one another by their personality and who they really are rather than the clothes they wear.

===Occupation===
Military, police, and firefighters usually wear [[uniform]]s, as do workers in many industries. School children often wear [[school uniform]]s, while college and university students sometimes wear [[academic dress]]. Members of religious orders may wear uniforms known as [[religious habit|habits]]. Sometimes a single item of clothing or a single accessory can declare one's occupation or rank within a profession

===Ethnic and political affiliation===
In many regions of the world, [[national costume]]s and styles in clothing and ornament declare membership in a certain village, caste, religion, etc. A Scotsman declares his clan with his [[tartan]]. A French peasant woman identified her village with her cap or [[coif]]. A Palestinian woman identifies her village with the pattern of [[Palestinian handicrafts#Embroidery and weaving|embroidery]] on her [[Palestinian costumes|dress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dispossessed: The Ordeal of the Palestinians |last=Gilmour |first=David |year=1983 |publisher=Sphere Books |location=London |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clothes can also proclaim dissent from cultural norms and mainstream beliefs, as well as personal independence. In 19th-century Europe, artists and writers lived ''[[Bohemianism|la vie de Bohème]]'' and dressed to shock: [[George Sand]] in men's clothing, female emancipationists in [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]], male artists in velvet [[waistcoat]]s and gaudy neckcloths. [[Bohemianism|Bohemians]], [[beatnik]]s, [[hippie]]s, [[Goth subculture|Goths]], [[Punk subculture|Punks]], and [[Skinhead]]s have continued the ([[counter-culture|countercultural]]) tradition in the 20th-century [[Western Culture|West]].

===Religious affiliation===
[[File:TiraMarket.jpg|thumb|Mannequins with traditional Muslim [[veil]] at a Saturday market in [[Tira, Israel]].]]
A [[Jewish]] or [[Muslim]] man may display his religious affiliation by wearing a [[cap]] and other traditional clothing. Many Muslim women wear head or body coverings (see [[sartorial hijab]], [[hijab]], [[burqa]] or [[niqab]], [[chador]], and [[abaya]]) that proclaim their status as respectable women and cover the so-called [[Intimate parts in Islam|intimate parts]]. A [[Jew]]ish man may indicate his observance of [[Judaism]] by wearing a [[kippah]].

===Marital status===
{{See also|Visual markers of marital status}}

Traditionally, [[Hindu]] women wear ''[[sindoor]]'', a red powder, in the parting of their hair to indicate their married status; if widowed, they abandon ''sindoor'' and jewelry and wear simple white clothing. However, this is not true of all Hindu women; in the modern world this is not a norm and women without sindoor may not necessarily be unmarried.

In many [[Orthodox Jewish]] circles, married women wear head coverings such as a hat, [[snood (headgear)|snood]], or wig. Additionally, after their marriage, Jewish men of [[Ashkenazi]] descent begin to wear a [[talit]] during prayer.

Men and women of the Western world may wear [[wedding ring]]s to indicate their married status, and women may also wear [[engagement ring]]s when they are engaged.

==Laws and social norms==
{{Main|Clothing laws by country}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
[[File:DDR Nude Beach model.jpg|thumb|Model of a nude beach in the DDR Museum, Berlin]]
In [[New Guinea]] and [[Vanuatu]], there are areas where it is customary for the men to wear nothing but penis sheaths in public - this is uncommon in more developed areas. Women wear [[string skirt]]s. In remote areas of [[Bali]], women may go [[toplessness|topless]]. In America and some parts of Europe, there are [[nude beach]]es.

In the [[United States]], a few businesses or [[restaurant]]s display dress code signs requiring shoes and shirts, claiming to be there on account of a health code,{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} although no such health codes exist.&lt;ref name="barefoot society"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barefooters.org/health-dept/ |title=Bare Feet and the Health Department |publisher=Barefooters.org |date=2010-01-24 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it is a common belief that there are laws against driving barefoot. However, no such laws exist. It is quite uncommon for people to be nude in public in the [[United States]] and in many circumstances, it is illegal. Many states and cities have laws and ordinances for [[indecent exposure]] and sometimes nudity can overlap with [[disorderly conduct]]. However, there are a few private beaches and resorts that cater to people who wish to be naked.

The “Free the Nipple Movement” is a global campaign seeking equality and empowerment for women when it comes to dress code. It emerged as a reaction to the idea that it was socially acceptable for men to appear without a shirt in public, whereas a woman appearing topless in public would be construed as indecent. The states of New York, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Ohio, and Texas have made it legal for both men and women to appear topless in public. The remainder of states consider the exposure of the female nipple to be an act of indecent exposure, putting them in a position where they can be charged with a criminal offense. This appears to be a gendered law that promotes different expectations on how a person is expected to dress when in public.

The Gender Nondiscrimination Act prohibits employers, health care providers, and housing authorities from discriminating against people on the basis of gender. While employers are not able to discriminate in their hiring practices, they do have the ability to create a gendered uniform. Employers cannot force someone to wear a uniform for a gender they do not identify themselves as, but this becomes an issue for non binary gendered people. In society, clothing is marketed by gender and dressing across this established line is often construed as an anomaly. Skirts, dresses, and high heels are clothing marketed almost exclusively for women. If a man wore any of these pieces in public it would be seen as outside of the norm.

Private organisations may insist on particular dress codes or standards in particular situations.

*Religious bodies may insist on their standards of [[modesty]] being followed at their premises and events.
*Employees are sometimes required to wear a [[uniform]] or certain standards of dress, such as a business suit or tie. This may depend on particular situations, for example if they are expected to interact with customers. (see also [[International standard business attire]]) These policies vary depending on the industry with [[lawyers]], [[bankers]], and [[Executive (management)|executives]] often wearing suit and tie. Some work places require that [[tattoo]]s be covered.
*Patrons of a [[disco]] or [[nightclub]] are sometimes expected to dress in a particular style, such as [[clubwear]]; and [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]]s of a disco or nightclub at times refuse entrance to those whose clothing they consider not consistent with the atmosphere of the venue.
*Patrons of a [[casino]], shop, or restaurant are usually expected to dress to a minimum standard, such as [[smart casual]].
*The organisers of some parties sometimes specify a costume or theme for the event, such as a [[naked party]] or [[toga party]].
*[[Fetish club]]s often require patrons to dress in [[fetish fashion|fetish clothing]] or else all in black.

Dress codes function on certain social occasions and for certain jobs. A [[military]] institution may require specified [[uniform]]s; if it allows the wearing of plain clothes it may place restrictions on their use.

A "formal" or [[white tie]] dress code typically means tail-coats for men and full-length evening dresses for women. "Semi-formal" has a much less precise definition but typically means an evening jacket and tie for men (known as [[black tie]]) and a dress for women. "Business casual" typically means not wearing [[necktie]]s or [[suit (clothing)|suit]]s, but wearing instead collared shirts, and more ''country'' trousers (not black, but more ''relaxed'', including things such as [[corduroy]]). "Casual" typically just means clothing for the torso, legs and shoes. "Wedding Casual" defines yet another mode of dress, where guests dress respectfully, but not necessarily fancily. The [[uniform]] may consist of various items that are appropriate length and style depending on what the school suggests: for example, khaki pants or [[shorts]], plaid skirts, a button-up collared shirt, a sweater, a [[coat (clothing)|coat]] and [[necktie|tie]] and even [[socks]]. Some schools have each grade assigned a color type which communicates what grade the student is currently in. That way if a student is lost someone is able to figure out what [[educational stage|grade]] they are in just by looking at the color of their shirt. If the student is younger, older students and faculty are able to look out for them and make sure they are safe.
Organisations which seek to maintain standards of [[modesty]] have difficulties with [[Sheer fabric|sheer]] and [[see-through clothing]].

Dress codes usually set a lower limit on body covering. However, sometimes it can specify the opposite: for example, in UK gay jargon, ''dress code'', means people who dress in a militaristic manner. ''Dress code'' nights in nightclubs, and elsewhere, are deemed to specifically target people who have militaristic fetishes (e.g. leather/[[skinhead]] men).

==Education==

=== History in school ===
Dress codes were first implemented in the school system to prevent students from wearing inappropriate clothing items to school and was thought to create a safer and more professional environment. Even though dress code was created to positively affect schools, the rules actually impede on students' right to self-expression. There have been many court cases regarding school dress code, the first being the Tinker vs. Des Moines Independent School District. The case was held because students wore black armbands to protest the Vietnam war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://education.findlaw.com/student-rights/school-dress-codes.html|title=School Dress Codes - FindLaw|work=Findlaw|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
In some grade schools, students are prevented from wearing short shorts, leggings, crop tops, saggy pants, and other clothing items that are deemed "too revealing" or "inappropriate".

In colleges, the most common type of dress code is business casual, but most colleges don't have dress code requirements.

===Non-communicative and communicative===
Non-communicative dress code violations in public schools are violations that are without implications of hate, gang-affiliation, etc.&lt;ref name="Herbon, Beth 2000"&gt;Herbon, Beth, and Jane E. Workman. "Dress and Appearance Codes in Public Secondary School Handbooks." Journal of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences 92.5 (2000): 68-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Communicative dress code violations are violations of an explicit nature, where the clothing has implications of hate, violence, gang-affiliation, etc.&lt;ref name="Herbon, Beth 2000" /&gt;

===Dress code violations and the courts===
In cases where dress code rules in public school systems have been violated by noncommunicative clothing, courts repeatedly legitimise dress code discrimination based on [[gender]].&lt;ref name="Smith, Natalie 2012"&gt;Smith, Natalie. "Eliminating Gender Stereotypes in Public School Dress Codes: The Necessity of Respecting Personal Preference." ''Journal of Law &amp; Education''; 41.1 (2012): 251-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the [[transgender]] populations, gender based dress codes are primarily enforced against individuals who do not yet [[Passing (gender)|pass]].&lt;ref name="Smith, Natalie 2012"/&gt;

White collar work place clothing has changed significantly through the years. In a corporate office, appropriate clothes are clean, business casual clothes such as (for men) a [[dress shirt]], [[polo shirt]], and [[trousers]], or other similar outfits. [[Suit (clothing)|Suit]]s, [[neckties]], and other formal wear are usually only required in law offices and financial sector offices. Previous business dress code eras (the 1950s in the U.S.) featured standardized business clothes that strongly differentiated what was acceptable and unacceptable for men and women to wear while working. Today, the two styles have merged; women's work clothes expanded to include the suit (and its variants) in addition to the usual dresses, skirts, and blouses; men's clothes have expanded to include garments and bright colours. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Casual wear entered business culture with the advent of the Silicon Valley, California, technology company featuring casual work clothes on the job. Additionally, some companies set aside days — generally Fridays ("dress-down Friday", "[[casual Friday]]") — when workers may wear casual clothes. The clothing a company requires its worker to wear on the job varies with the occupation and profession.

Some businesses observe that anti-discrimination law restricts their determining what is appropriate and inappropriate workplace clothing. Requiring men and women to dress differently at the workplace can be challenged because the gender-specific dress codes would be based on one sex and could be considered stereotypical.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/toolkits/pages/employeedressandappearance.aspx|website=Society for Human Resource Management|accessdate=27 September 2017|title = Employee Dress and Appearance}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, in fact, most businesses have much authority in determining and establishing what work place clothes they can require of their workers. Generally, a carefully drafted dress code applied consistently does not violate anti-discrimination laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ppspublishers.com/biz/dresscode.htm |title = Dress Code Legal Issues|website =  Personnel Policy Services Inc|last = Thomas|first = Robin|dead-url = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160314064207/http://www.ppspublishers.com/biz/dresscode.htm|archivedate = 14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business casual===
{{Main|Business casual}}
[[File:Obama 013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Barack Obama]] in what can be considered as men's Business Casual, 2010]]

''Business casual'' dress, also "smart casual", is a popular work place dress code that emerged in [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] workplaces in [[Western world|Western countries]] in the 1990s, especially in the United States and Canada. Many [[information technology]] businesses in [[Silicon Valley]] were early adopters of this dress code. In contrast to formal business wear such as [[suit (clothing)|suit]]s and [[necktie]]s (the [[international standard business attire]]), the business casual dress code has no generally accepted definition; its interpretation differs widely among organizations and is often a cause of sartorial confusion among workers.

The [[job search engine]] [[Monster.com]] offers this definition: ''In general, business casual means dressing professionally, looking relaxed, yet neat and pulled together''. A more pragmatic definition is that business casual dress is the mid ground between formal business clothes and street clothes. Examples of clothing combinations considered appropriate for work by businesses that consider themselves as using the business-casual dress code are:

*for men: a shirt with a collar ([[polo shirt]]) and [[cotton]] [[trousers]] (or "khakis" in [[American English]]).
*for women: a tennis shirt and trousers.

Generally, neckties are excluded from business casual dress, unless worn in nontraditional ways. The acceptability of blue [[jeans]] and denim cloth clothing varies — some businesses consider them to be sloppy and informal.

==Inverse dress codes==
Inverse dress codes, sometimes referred to as "[[undress code]]", set forth an upper bound, rather than a lower bound, on body covering. An example of an undress code is the one commonly enforced in modern communal bathing facilities. For example, in the public bath [[SchwabenQuellen]], no clothing of any kind is allowed in the sauna part of the resort. Other, less strict undress codes are common in public pools, especially indoor pools, in which shoes and shirts are disallowed.

Places where [[social nudity]] is practiced may be "clothing optional," or nudity may be compulsory, with exceptions. See [[issues in social nudity]].

==Violation of clothing taboos==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
{{Essay-like|section|date=December 2017}}
Some clothing ''faux pas'' may occur intentionally for reasons of [[fashion]] or personal [[preference]]. People have the right to express themselves in freedom of speech and expression under the first amendment; however, some styles of clothing that people may chose to wear can be seen as taboos or violations. Dress codes are a way that public schools try to limit violence and danger in the classroom and at the school, as stated by Sue M. Stanley, a professor at California State University, Long Beach, in the journal of Education and Urban Society. She says how clothing styles, such as gang clothing, are linked with violence in schools. She believes that dress codes and uniforms will reduce the focus on fashion contests and violence and instead promote ideas and achievements. Violations of clothing taboos, such as students wearing gang clothing or intentionally baggy clothing, can be viewed as unsafe by administrators. However, these students are just expressing themselves in their style and fashion. For instance, the [[adolescence|teenage]] boys of [[hip hop#Culture|rap]] duo [[Kris Kross]] of the early 1990s wore all of their clothes backwards and extremely baggy. Just because the boys of the rap duo Kris Kross wore their clothing like this it did not make them dangerous. Rather, they were just trying to be different and break common fashion “rules” to express themselves. Limiting students to only wear certain things or uniforms because of fashion taboos is a violation against their freedom of expression. As stated by Paul M. Murphy, a lawyer and writer for the Southern California Law Review, in the article “Restricting Gang Clothing in Public Schools: Does a Dress Code Violate a Student's Right of Free Expression” in the Southern California Law Review, as an attempt to keep schools safe, administrators are prohibiting students from wearing gang related clothing. However this is a violation of the first amendment which is the freedom of speech and expression, says Paul M. Murphy.
There can be different clothing styles that can be viewed as taboo for different age groups and genders to wear as well. For example, for older women to wear brighter colors and revealing or overly suggestive clothing is seen as a clothing taboo for this era of women. This information was taken from a survey done by the journal of Ageing and Society, where they had 36 women from the ages 71 to 93 say what clothes they usually don't wear, to see what their perspective on clothing and different styles are for their age group. The majority of women said that they refrain from wearing styles such as bright colors and revealing or overly suggestive clothing. The women view these styles as taboo for their age, however that does not mean that one can not wear these clothing styles if they are in this age group.
There are different clothing brands and stores that can be seen as taboo as well. In a study done in the journal of Middle East Technical University Studies in Development, researchers took 300 participants in an emerging market context to see the effects of different styles and brands on the participants. The results were that customers were becoming less predictable and more diverse in their brands and clothing stores than before. This shows how people have lots of different styles of clothing and fashion, and how that is making clothing taboos become less common and not seen as a restriction.

==Rebellion against dress codes==
{{Example farm|section|date=December 2017}}
Social attitudes to clothing have brought about various rules and social conventions, such as keeping the body covered, and not showing underwear in public. The backlash against these social norms has become a traditional form of rebellion. An example of rebellion of general, universal dress codes is cross dressing. Cross dressing is defined as wearing clothing typical of the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cloud|first1=Duane|title=What is Cross Dressing?|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-cross-dressing-definition-psychology.html|website=Study.com|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a rebellion to dress codes, because it goes against most social norms of a general dress code for men and women. Also over time, western societies have gradually adopted more casual dress codes in the workplace, school, and leisure. This has especially been the case since the early 1960s.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

On Monday, September 22, 2014, "about 100 pupils walked out of Bingham high school in South Jordan, Utah."&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Rory|title=Students protest 'slut shaming' high school dress codes with mass walkouts|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/sep/24/us-high-schools-dress-codes-protest-sexism-hemline|website=The Guardian|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students staged a walkout because more than a dozen girls were turned away from a [[homecoming dance]] for wearing dresses which violated the dress code rules.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; "School staff allegedly lined up girls against a wall as they arrived and banished about two dozen for having dresses which purportedly showed too much skin and violated the rules." It is believed that this act was awkward and humiliating towards the female students, which spawned the walkouts.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

Certain dress code restrictions in schools across North America are believed to be perpetuating sexist standards, since they concentrate specifically on females and what they are and are not allowed to wear. There is also an emphasis placed on the effects that girls’ wardrobe choices have on their male classmates, which is seen by some as inappropriate. In March 2014, a group of middle-school girls from Evanston, Illinois protested their school's dress code, which prohibited them from wearing leggings to school under the pretense that it was “too distracting for boys.” Thirteen-year-old student, Sophie Hasty, was quoted in the Evanston Review saying that “not being able to wear leggings because it’s ‘too distracting for boys’ is giving us the impression we should be guilty for what guys do.” In a Time magazine article covering the incident, Eliana Dockterman argued that teachers and administration in these schools are “walking the fine line between enforcing a dress code and slut shaming.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Enforcing School Dress Codes Turns Into Slut Shaming|url=http://time.com/36997/when-enforcing-school-dress-codes-turns-into-slut-shaming/|website=TIME.com|accessdate=2015-11-16|first=Eliana|last=Dockterman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, a similar incident occurred at Tottenville High School in Staten Island, New York. Within the first few days of the semester, two hundred detention slips were handed out to students who violated the school's dress code. Approximately ninety percent of the slips distributed were given to girls as their clothing was deemed “disruptive to teaching and learning.” Many claim that making girls feel guilty for the actions of boys is similar to telling victims of sexual assault that they were “asking for it” by dressing in a particular manner and has thus been linked to the practice of victim-blaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schools Are Still Slut-Shaming Girls While Enforcing Dress Code|url=http://time.com/3394549/dress-code-long-island-new-york/|website=TIME.com|accessdate=2015-11-16|first=Eliana|last=Dockterman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Canadian teenager, Lauren Wiggins, was given detention in May 2015 for wearing a floor-length dress with a halter neckline. The punishment prompted Wiggins to write an open letter to the school's assistant vice principal at Harrison Trimble High School in Moncton, New Brunswick. In the letter, Wiggins concentrated specifically on the fact that females are often blamed for the behaviour of males, saying that if a boy "will get distracted by my upper back and shoulders then he needs to be sent home and practice self-control." She was then given a one-day suspension after writing and submitting the letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/14/lauren-wiggins-haltar-top_n_7284528.html|title=High Schooler Lauren Wiggins' Letter Nails Exactly What's Wrong With School Dress Codes|date=14 May 2015|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''epiphany''' (from the [[ancient Greek]] ἐπιφάνεια, ''epiphaneia'', "manifestation, striking appearance") is an experience of a sudden and striking realization. Generally the term is used to describe scientific breakthrough, religious or philosophical discoveries, but it can apply in any situation in which an enlightening realization allows a problem or situation to be understood from a new and deeper perspective. Epiphanies are studied by [[psychologist]]s&lt;ref name="Jarvis1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonald2008"/&gt; and other scholars, particularly those attempting to study the process of [[innovation]].&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeemingMadden2009"/&gt;

Epiphanies are relatively rare occurrences and generally follow a process of significant thought about a problem. Often they are triggered by a new and key piece of information, but importantly, a depth of prior knowledge is required to allow the leap of understanding.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Famous epiphanies include [[Archimedes]]'s discovery of a method to determine the density of an object ("[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!") and [[Isaac Newton]]'s realization that a falling apple and the orbiting moon are both pulled by the same force.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tigges1999"/&gt;

==History==
The word epiphany originally referred to insight through the [[divine]].&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Platt, V. J. (2011) ''Facing the Gods. Epiphany and Representation in Graeco-Roman Art, Literature and Religion''. Cambridge University Press.'' ''&lt;/ref&gt; Today, this concept is more often used without such connotations, but a popular implication remains that the epiphany is [[supernatural]], as the discovery seems to come suddenly from the outside.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-5"/&gt;

The word's secular usage may owe much of its popularity to Irish novelist [[James Joyce]]. The Joycean epiphany has been defined as "a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether from some object, scene, event, or memorable phase of the mind — the manifestation being out of proportion to the significance or strictly logical relevance of whatever produces it."&lt;ref&gt;Morris Beja, ''Epiphany in the Modern Novel.'' Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1971. P. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The author used epiphany as a literary device within each entry of his short story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' (1914); his protagonists came to sudden recognitions that changed their view of themselves and/or their social conditions. Joyce had first expounded on epiphany's meaning in the fragment ''[[Stephen Hero]],'' although this was only published posthumously in 1944. For the philosopher [[Emmanuel Lévinas]], epiphany or a manifestation of the divine is seen in another's face (see [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]]).
[[Image:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flammarion engraving]]. From "L'atmosphère", book of 1888]]
In traditional and pre-modern cultures, [[initiation]] rites and [[western esotericism|mystery religion]]s have served as vehicles of epiphany, as well as the arts. The [[Greek drama]]tists and [[Greek poetry|poets]] would, in the ideal, induct the audience into states of ''[[catharsis]]'' or ''[[kenosis]]'', respectively. In modern times an epiphany lies behind the title of [[William Burroughs]]' ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', a drug-influenced state, as Burroughs explained, "a frozen moment when everyone sees what is at the end of the fork." Both the [[Dadaist]] [[Marcel Duchamp]] and the [[Pop Art]]ist [[Andy Warhol]] would invert expectations by presenting commonplace objects or graphics as works of [[fine art]] (for example a [[Fountain (Duchamp)|urinal as a fountain]]), simply by presenting them in a way no one had thought to do before; the result was intended to induce an epiphany of "what art is" or is not.

==Process==
Epiphanies can come in many different forms, and are often generated by a complex combination of experience, memory, knowledge, predisposition and context. A contemporary example of an epiphany in education might involve the process by which a student arrives at some form of new insight or clarifying thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kounios|first1=John|last2=Beeman|first2=Mark|title=The Aha! Moment: The Cognitive Neuroscience of Insight|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2009|volume=18|issue=4|pages=210–216|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01638.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.521.6014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this popular image, epiphany is the result of significant work on the part of the discoverer, and is only the satisfying result of a long process.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-6-8"/&gt; The surprising and fulfilling feeling of epiphany is so surprising because one cannot predict when one's labor will bear fruit, and our subconscious can play a significant part in delivering the solution; and is fulfilling because it is a reward for a long period of effort.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-6-8"/&gt;

==Myth==
A common myth predicts that most, if not all, innovations occur through epiphanies.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt; Not all innovations occur through epiphanies; Scott Berkun notes that "the most useful way to think of an epiphany is as an occasional bonus of working on tough problems".&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Most innovations occur without epiphany, and epiphanies often contribute little towards finding the next one.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Crucially, epiphany cannot be predicted, or controlled.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;

Although epiphanies are only a rare occurrence, crowning a process of significant labor, there is a common myth that epiphanies of sudden comprehension are commonly responsible for leaps in technology and the sciences.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Famous epiphanies include Archimedes' realization of how to estimate the volume of a given mass, which inspired him to shout "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!" ("I have found it!").&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt; The biographies of many mathematicians and scientists include an epiphanic episode early in the career, the ramifications of which were worked out in detail over the following years. For example, allegedly [[Albert Einstein]] was struck as a young child by being given a compass, and realizing that some unseen force in space was making it move. Another, perhaps better, example from Einstein's life occurred in 1905 after he had spent an evening unsuccessfully trying to reconcile Newtonian physics and Maxwell's equations. While taking a streetcar home, he looked behind him at the receding clocktower in [[Bern]] and realized that if the car sped up close to the speed of light, he would see the clock slow down; with this thought, he later remarked, "a storm broke loose in my mind," which would allow him to understand special relativity. Einstein had a second epiphany two years later in 1907 which he called "the happiest thought of my life" when he imagined an elevator falling, and realized that a passenger would not be able to tell the difference between the weightlessness of falling, and the weightlessness of space - a thought which allowed him to generalize his theory of relativity to include gravity as a curvature in spacetime. A similar flash of [[holistic]] understanding in a prepared mind was said to give [[Charles Darwin]] his "hunch" (about [[natural selection]]), and Darwin later stated that he always remembered the spot in the road where his carriage was when the epiphany struck. Another famous epiphany myth is associated with Isaac Newton's apple story,&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt; and yet another with Nikola Tesla's discovery of a workable alternating current induction motor. Though such epiphanies might have occurred, they were almost certainly the result of long and intensive periods of study those individuals had undertaken, rather than an out-of-the-blue flash of inspiration about an issue they had not thought about previously.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;

Another myth is that epiphany is simply another word for (usually spiritual) [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]. Actually, realism and psychology make epiphany a different mode as distinguished from vision, even though both vision and epiphany are often triggered by (sometimes seemingly) irrelevant incidents or objects.&lt;ref name="Tigges1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-11"/&gt;

==In religion==
{{Further information|Epiphany (holiday)|theophany|hierophany}}
In Christianity, the Epiphany refers to a realization that Christ is the Son of God. Western churches generally celebrate the [[Visit of the Magi]] as the [[revelation]] of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of the infant Christ, and commemorate the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]] on January 6. Traditionally, Eastern churches, following the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar, have celebrated Epiphany (or [[Theophany]]) in conjunction with Christ's baptism by [[John the Baptist]] and celebrated it on January 19; however, other Eastern churches have adopted the Western Calendar and celebrate it on January 6.&lt;ref name="The Season of Epiphany"/&gt; Some Protestant churches often celebrate Epiphany as a season, extending from the last day of Christmas until either [[Ash Wednesday]], or the Feast of the Presentation on February 2.

In more general terms, the phrase "religious epiphany" is used when a person realizes their faith, or when they are convinced that an event or happening was really caused by a deity or being of their faith. In Hinduism, for example, epiphany might refer to [[Arjuna]]'s realization that [[Krishna]] (incarnation of God serving as his charioteer in the "[[Bhagavad Gita]]") is indeed representing the Universe. The Hindu term for epiphany would be [[bodhodaya]], from Sanskrit [[bodha]] 'wisdom' and udaya 'rising'. Or in Buddhism, the term might refer to the Buddha obtaining enlightenment under the [[bodhi]] tree, finally realizing the nature of the universe, and thus attaining [[Nirvana]]. The Zen term ''[[kensho]]'' also describes this moment, referring to the feeling attendant on realizing the answer to a ''[[koan]]''.

In European academic traditions, '''fine art''' is art developed primarily for [[aesthetics]] or beauty, distinguishing it from [[applied art]], which also has to serve some practical function, such as [[pottery]] or most metalwork.

Historically, the five main fine arts were [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[music]], and [[poetry]], with performing arts including [[theatre]] and [[dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/35561/35561-h/35561-h.htm#ar209|title=The Project Gutenberg EBook of Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=11|volume=10|year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the fine arts commonly include additional forms, such as [[film]], [[photography]], [[video production]]/[[Video editing|editing]], [[design]], [[sequential art]], [[conceptual art]], and [[printmaking]].

One definition of ''fine art'' is "a visual art considered to have been created primarily for [[aesthetic]] and intellectual purposes and judged for its beauty and meaningfulness, specifically, painting, sculpture, drawing, watercolor, graphics, and architecture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fine+art |title=Fine art &amp;#124; Define Fine art at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, there are conceptual differences between the ''fine arts'' and the ''applied arts''. As originally conceived, and as understood for much of the modern era, the perception of aesthetic qualities required a refined judgment usually referred to as having good [[taste (sociology)|taste]], which differentiated fine art from popular art and entertainment.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|title=Aesthetic Judgment|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "fine" does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This definition originally excluded the applied or [[decorative arts]], and the products of what were regarded as [[craft]]s.  In contemporary practice these distinctions and restrictions have become essentially meaningless, as the concept or intention of the artist is given primacy, regardless of the means through which this is expressed.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==History==
{{Main article|Art history}}
{{History of art sidebar}}
According to some writers the concept of a distinct category of fine art is an invention of the [[early modern period]] in the West.  Larry Shiner in his ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' (2003) locates the invention in the 18th century:
"There was a traditional “system of the arts” in the West before the eighteenth century. (Other traditional cultures still have a similar system.) In that system, an artist or artisan was a skilled maker or practitioner, a work of art was the useful product of skilled work, and the appreciation of the arts was integrally connected with their role in the rest of life. “Art”, in other words, meant approximately the same thing as the Greek word techne, or in English “skill”, a sense that has survived in phrases like “the art of war”, “the art of love”, and “the art of medicine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519|title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's ''The Invention of Art: A Cultural History''|journal=Contemporary Aesthetics|author=Clowney, David|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar ideas have been expressed by [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], and [[Terry Eagleton]] (e.g. The Ideology of the Aesthetic), though the point of invention is often placed earlier, in the [[Italian Renaissance]].

==Cultural perspectives==
The separation of arts and crafts that often exists in Europe and the US is not shared by all other cultures. In [[Japanese aesthetics]], the activities of everyday life are depicted by integrating not only art with craft but man-made with nature. Traditional [[Chinese art]] distinguished within [[Chinese painting]] between the mostly landscape [[literati painting]] of [[scholar gentlemen]] and the artisans of the schools of court painting and sculpture. A high status was also given to many things that would be seen as craft objects in the West, in particular ceramics, [[hardstone carving|jade carving]], weaving, and embroidery. [[Latin American art]] was dominated by European colonialism until the 20th-century, when indigenous art began to reassert itself inspired by the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist Movement]], which reunited arts with crafts based upon socialist principles. In Africa, [[Yoruba art]] often has a political and spiritual function. As with the art of the Chinese, the art of the Yoruba is also often composed of what would ordinarily be considered in the West to be craft production. Some of its most admired manifestations, such as sculpture and textiles, fall in this category.

==Visual arts==
=== Two-dimensional works ===

====Painting and drawing====
{{Main article|Painting|Drawing}}
Drawing is a form of visual expression  and is one of the major forms of the visual arts. Common instruments include: [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[chalk]], [[pastel]]s, [[marker pen|marker]]s, [[stylus]], or various metals like [[silverpoint]].  There are a number of subcategories of drawing, including [[cartooning]] and creating [[comics]]. There remains debate whether the following is considered a part of “drawing” as “fine art”: "[[doodling]]", drawing in the fog a [[shower]] and leaving an imprint on the [[bathroom]] [[mirror]], or the [[surrealism|surrealist]] method of "[[entopic graphomania]]", in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and the lines are then made between the dots.

==== Mosaics ====
{{Main article|Mosaic}}
[[File:Christ Hagia Sofia.jpg|thumb|upright|Mosaic of [[Christ Pantocrator]] from [[Hagia Sophia]]]]
Mosaics are images formed with small pieces of stone or glass, called ''[[tessera]]e''.  They can be decorative or functional.  An artist who designs and makes mosaics is called a mosaic artist or a mosaicist.

==== Printmaking ====
{{Main article|Printmaking}}
[[File:Dürer Melancholia I.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Melencolia I]]'', 1514, [[Dürer]]]]
Printmaking is the process of making artworks by [[printing]], normally on [[paper]]. Except in the case of [[monotyping]], the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a print. Each print is considered an original, as opposed to a copy. The reasoning behind this is that the print is not a reproduction of another [[work of art]] in a different medium — for instance, a painting — but rather an image designed from inception as a print. An individual print is also referred to as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, known technically as a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]]. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for [[engraving]] or [[etching]]; stone, used for [[lithography]]; blocks of wood for [[woodcut]]s, linoleum for [[linocut]]s and fabric in the case of [[screen-printing]]. But there are many other kinds, discussed below. Multiple nearly identical prints can be called an [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]. In modern times each print is often signed and numbered forming a "limited edition." Prints may also be published in book form, as [[artist's book]]s. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.

==== Calligraphy ====
{{Main article|Calligraphy}}
[[File:Folio from a Koran (8th-9th century).jpg|thumb|''Folio from a Koran'' (8–9th century), [[Abbasid]] [[Kufic]] Calligraphy]]
Calligraphy is a type of visual art. A contemporary definition of calligraphic practice is "the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious and skillful manner".&lt;ref name="Mediavilla"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mediavilla, C.|year=1996|title=Calligraphy|publisher=Scirpus Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern calligraphy ranges from functional hand-lettered inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the abstract expression of the handwritten mark may or may not compromise the legibility of the letters.&lt;ref name="Mediavilla"/&gt; Classical calligraphy differs from typography and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may create all of these; characters are historically disciplined yet fluid and spontaneous, improvised at the moment of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2006|title=Kalligrafie: Intensiv Training|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt Mainz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2005|title=Kalligrafie:Erste Hilfe und Schrift-Training mit Muster-Alphabeten|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt Mainz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=*[[Hermann Zapf|Zapf, H.]]|year=2007|title=Alphabet Stories: A Chronicle of Technical Developments|publisher=Cary Graphic Arts Press|location=Rochester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Photography ====
{{Main article|Fine-art photography}}
[[File:Adams The Tetons and the Snake River.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Ansel Adams]], ''The Tetons and the Snake River'', 1942]]
''Fine art photography'' refers to photographs that are created to fulfill the creative vision of the artist. Fine art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism and commercial photography.  Photojournalism visually communicates stories and ideas, mainly in print and digital media. Fine art photography is created primarily as an expression of the artist’s vision, but has also been important in advancing certain causes.

=== Three-dimensional works ===
====Architecture====
{{Main article|Architecture}}
[[File:Pantheon Dome.JPG|thumb|[[Pantheon, Rome|The Pantheon]]]]
[[Architecture]] is frequently considered a fine art, especially if its [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] components are spotlighted — in contrast to [[structural engineering|structural-engineering]] or [[construction management|construction-management]] components. Architectural works are perceived as cultural and political [[symbol]]s and works of art. Historical [[civilization]]s often are known primarily through their architectural achievements. Such buildings as the [[pyramids]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[Rome|Roman]] [[Colosseum]] are cultural symbols, and are important links in public consciousness, even when [[scholars]] have discovered much about past civilizations through other means. Cities, regions and cultures continue to identify themselves with, and are known by, their architectural monuments.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Tower Bridge]], the [[Eiffel Tower]] and the [[Colosseum]] are representative of the buildings used on advertising brochures.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pottery====
One field where "fine" remains a valid technical term is [[pottery]], especially in [[archaeology]].  "Fine wares" are high-quality pottery, often painted, moulded or otherwise decorated, and in many periods distinguished from "coarse" wares, which are basic utilitarian pots used by the mass of the population, or in the kitchen rather than for more formal purposes.

====Sculpture====
{{Main article|Sculpture}}
[[File:Ife sculpture Inv.A96-1-4.jpg|thumb|upright|Head [[Ife]] [[Terracotta]], [[Nigeria]], 12th–14th century]]
[[Sculpture]] is [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Visual arts|artwork]] created by shaping hard or [[plastic]] material, commonly [[Stone sculpture|stone]] (either [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[marble]]), [[metal]], or [[wood]]. Some sculptures are created directly by [[Wikt:carving|carving]]; others are assembled, built up and [[Kiln|fired]], [[Welding|welded]], [[Molding (process)|molded]], or [[Casting|cast]]. Because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated, it is considered one of the [[plastic arts]]. The majority of [[public art]] is sculpture. Many sculptures together in a [[garden]] setting may be referred to as a [[sculpture garden]].

====Conceptual art====
{{Main article|Conceptual art}}
[[File:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|left|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]], 1973]]
Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.
The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of ''idea-based art'' that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text. However, through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, its popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], developed as a synonym for all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name=tateconceptual&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/conceptual-art''Conceptual art'' Tate online glossary] tate.org.uk. Retrieved August 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
[[File:Pushkin (by Mate).jpg|thumb|[[Vasily Mate]], ''Portrait of [[Alexander Pushkin]]'' (1899)]]
{{Main article|Poetry}}
Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, "making") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as sound symbolism, phonaesthetics and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|year=2013|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[File:Fela Kuti.jpg|left|thumb|[[Fela Kuti]] in 1970]]
{{Main article|Music}}
Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").

==Performing Arts==
===Dance===
{{Main article|Dance}}
''Dance'' is an art form that generally refers to [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the body, usually rhythmic, and to music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance |title=britannica |publisher=britannica |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]], [[social interaction]] or presented in a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or performance setting.
Dance is also used to describe methods of [[nonverbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s ([[bee dance]], [[Fixed action pattern|patterns of behaviour]] such as a mating dance), [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects ''(the leaves danced in the wind)'', and certain musical genres. In sports, gymnastics, [[figure skating]] and [[synchronized swimming]] are ''dance disciplines'' while the ''[[Kata]]s'' of the [[martial arts]] are often compared to dances.

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre}}
[[File:Royal Opera House and ballerina.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Opera House]], London]]
Modern Western [[theatre]] is dominated by [[realism (arts)|realism]], including [[drama]] and [[comedy]].  Another popular Western form is [[musical theatre]].  Classical forms of theatre, including [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]], classic [[English drama]] ([[Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] included), and [[Theatre of France|French theater]] ([[Molière]] included), are still performed today. In addition, performances of classic Eastern forms such as [[Noh]] and [[Kabuki]] can be found in the West, although with less frequency.

===Film===
{{Main article|Film|Art film}}
''Fine arts film'' is a term that encompasses motion pictures and the field of film as a fine [[art]] form. A ''fine arts movie theater'' is a venue, usually a building, for viewing such movies. [[Film]]s are produced by [[Video recording|recording]] images from the world with [[camera]]s, or by creating images using [[animation]] techniques or [[special effect]]s.  Films are [[cultural artifact]]s created by specific [[culture]]s, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important [[art]] form, a source of popular entertainment and a powerful method for [[documentary film|educating]] — or [[propaganda|indoctrinating]] — citizens. The visual elements of cinema give motion pictures a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[subtitles]] that [[translation|translate]] the dialogue.

[[Cinematography]] is the discipline of making [[Stage lighting|lighting]] and [[camera]] choices when recording photographic [[image]]s for the [[film|cinema]]. It is closely related to the art of [[photography|still photography]], though many additional issues arise when both the camera and elements of the scene may be in motion.

[[Independent filmmaking]] often takes place outside of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], or other major [[studio system]]s. An independent film (or ''indie film)'' is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a [[list of Hollywood movie studios|major movie studio]].  Creative, business, and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century.

}}
'''''Five Modern Nō Plays''''' is a collection of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] written by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] writer [[Yukio Mishima]]. Mishima wrote these plays between 1950 and 1955 and presented them as modern plays in [[Tokyo]]. Of these five, only The Damask Drum was expressed in the traditional Nō fashion. ''[[The Lady Aoi]]'' was expressed as a Western-style [[Opera]]. The plays take older Nō plots or traditional and foreign fairy tales and bring them to a modern setting. 

Famed Japan scholar [[Donald Keene]] translated "Five Modern Nō Plays."

==Plays==

*[[Sotoba Komachi (Mishima)|Sotoba Komachi]]:
A poet meets Komachi, a repulsive-looking old woman, at a Tokyo park in the night. She expresses the memory of when she had been lovely 80 years ago. She reminisces on a night in the 1880s, and together with the help of the poet (who acts the part of the Military Officer with whom she fell in love), they relive that night. The poet realizes that she is still beautiful, and sees past her ragged clothes and wretched body. But expressing her beauty can only result in death.  

*The Damask Drum:
An old man becomes enamored with a neighbor. The neighbor and her associates play a trick on the man by challenging him to sound a drum. If he can make the drum sound, he will earn a kiss. However, this drum is made of [[damask]], and is only a [[Theatrical property|prop]], incapable of making any sound. 

*Kantan:
A youth who see no meaning in anything, wonders what will happen if he sleeps on a magical pillow which makes the dreamer realize what he already understands, the futility of existence. 

*Hanjo
*[[The Lady Aoi]]

==Reception==

Mishima received the illustrious [[Kunio Kishida|Kishida]] Prize for Drama from [[Shinchosha|Shinchosha Publishing]], 1955.

{{Quote|
Dena came from a bedsit in [[Ladbroke Grove]], long before [[Notting Hill]] became fashionable.

Her parents were Jewish refugees. When Dena – Geraldine Sherman – was born, her father was in an internment camp in Australia and her nervous mother sent her out of London to the safety of a Jewish orphanage in [[Shenfield]], Essex.

The kindly matron was her mother figure, so, when she was sent back to live with her parents at the age of 11, she was miserable.

"All I wanted was to go back to the orphanage," she says. "I was embarrassed by my parents, by their broken English and their permanent refugee complex. I hadn't been brought up to think that every time the doorbell rang, it was the [[Gestapo]]."

One happy memory from the orphanage to which she clung during the difficult years with her parents was of an outing to the theatre. "We were taken to see a frothy pink and white fantasy show," she remembers.

"Afterwards, I was taken to the stage door and I didn't have my arm through the sleeve of my jacket, so it was hanging loose. When the star came out, she said: 'Would the little girl with only one arm please step forward?' I immediately put on a limp as well and, from that moment, I was on the road to make-believe."

At the age of 17, she ran away to join a theatre group.

{{Quote|
Her greatest pride is reserved for the charity, "Only Make Believe", which she founded with the idea of letting the theatre help institutionalised children as it had once helped her. At first, she had thought of taking sick children to the theatre, but it was such a problem getting them there that they were too exhausted to enjoy the shows.

Instead, she has brought the theatre to the children. The actors arrive with a large dressing-up trunk to rehearse a play in hospital using a script by Dena and children as performers.

After attending a [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] basketball game, an immigration lawyer named Mack ([[Kevin Kline]]) finds himself at the mercy of potential [[Robbery|muggers]] when his car breaks down in a bad part of [[Los Angeles]] late at night. The muggers are talked out of their plans by Simon ([[Danny Glover]]), a tow truck driver who arrives just in time. Mack sets out to befriend Simon, despite their having nothing in common.

In the meantime, Mack's wife Claire ([[Mary McDonnell]]) and his best friend Davis ([[Steve Martin]]), a [[film producer|producer]] of violent [[action film]]s, are experiencing life-changing events. Claire encounters an abandoned baby while jogging and becomes determined to [[adoption|adopt]] her. Davis suddenly becomes interested in philosophy rather than [[box-office]] [[profit (accounting)|profit]]s after being shot in the leg by a man trying to [[theft|steal]] his watch, vowing to devote the remainder of his career to eliminating violence from the [[Film|cinema]].

The film chronicles how these characters—as well as various acquaintances, co-workers and relatives—are affected by their interactions in the light of life-changing events. In the end, they visit the [[Grand Canyon]] on a shared vacation trip, united in a place that is philosophically and actually "bigger" than all their little separate lives.

==Production==
Parts of the film were shot at [[Glen Canyon]] in [[Utah]] as well as [[Los Angeles]] and [[Canoga Park, California]] and the Grand Canyon in [[Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The footage of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] game in the film was shot before anybody knew Lakers guard [[Magic Johnson|Earvin "Magic" Johnson]] was HIV+. Rita Kempley, in her film review in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', pointed to this scene as proof that "... the filmmaker and his team ha[d] truly caught society on the verge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Kempley | first=Rita | title=Grand Canyon | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/grandcanyonrkempley_a0a28b.htm | work=The Washington Post | date=January 10, 1992 | accessdate=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character Davis is based on action film producer [[Joel Silver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Wells | first=Jeffrey | title=Enough Already: Joel Silver, Model Mogul | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-02-21/entertainment/ca-953_1_joel-silver | work=Los Angeles Times | date=February 21, 1993 | accessdate=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
''Grand Canyon'' received generally positive reviews from critics; it has a 7/10 "fresh" rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and a critical rating of 76% based on 34 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1037642-grand_canyon/ "Grand Canyon (1991),"] Rotten Tomatoes. Accessed Dec. 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote,

{{quote|Set in Los Angeles, and gliding gracefully among a representative set of characters, the film means to move through different economic strata, age groups and racial backgrounds in its search for common experience. If the ambition to do this is ultimately more impressive than the hazy, unfocused outcome, Mr. Kasdan still deserves a lot of credit for what he has tried.&lt;ref&gt;Maslin, Janet. [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CE3D6113DF936A15751C1A967958260 "Review/Film; The Accidents and Miracles in Everyday Life,"] ''New York Times'' (Dec. 25, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a similar vein, ''[[Washington Post]]'' critic Rita Kempley wrote, 

{{quote|''Grand Canyon'' considers the ever-widening chasms that divide us, the shifting demographic fault lines that have set society quaking like the needle on [[Richter's scale]]. ... This City of the Angels captured by Kasdan, its skies buzzing with helicopters, reminds us most of all of [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. But this is not war, it's suicide, America in the latent stages of self-inflicted apocalypse. Kasdan validates our fears, but he doesn't strip us of all hope, for the central image also promises something greater than ourselves. The view from the edge can be awesome.&lt;ref name=Kempley&gt;Kempley, Rita.

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' chided the film for its "... solemn zeitgeist chic," and called it "... way too self-conscious," but ultimately decided that "''Grand Canyon'' is finally a very classy soap opera, one that holds a generous mirror up to its audience's anxieties. It's the sort of movie that says: Life is worth living. After a couple of hours spent with characters this enjoyable, the message — in all its forthright sentimentality — feels earned."&lt;ref&gt;Gleiberman, Owen. [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,309132,00.html "Grand Canyon (1991),"] ''Entertainment Weekly''. (Jan 10, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four out of four stars, and wrote, "In a time when our cities are wounded, movies like ''Grand Canyon'' can help to heal."&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger. [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920110/REVIEWS/201100302 "Grand Canyon,"] ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' (Jan. 10, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert's television reviewing partner [[Gene Siskel]] also loved the film,{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} with Ebert placing it at the #4 and Siskel at #6 on their 1991 top ten lists.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Awards===
The film won the [[Golden Bear]] for Best Film at the [[42nd Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1992/03_preistr_ger_1992/03_Preistraeger_1992.html |title=Berlinale: 1992 Prize Winners |accessdate=2011-05-24 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplay was nominated for the Oscar (as Best Original Screenplay), the Golden Globe and the Writers Guild of America.

===Box office===
''Grand Canyon'' was considered a minor failure at the box office,{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} taking in $40.9 million,&lt;ref name="Mojo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800168415/info "Grand Canyon (1991),"] Yahoo! Movies. Accessed 2 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and did not reap notable profits until it was released on video.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Legacy==
[[Phil Collins]]' 1993 song "[[Both Sides of the Story]]" references the scene from ''Grand Canyon'' where the young mugger tells Simon (played by Danny Glover) that he carries a gun to make sure people respect (and fear) him.&lt;ref&gt;Kot, Greg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7718">[[Image:Little Rock Desegregation 1957.jpg|thumb|290px|right|Massery shouting at Eckford (center)]]

'''Hazel Bryan Massery''' (born {{circa|1934}}) was a student at [[Little Rock Central High School]] during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. She was depicted in an iconic photograph that showed her shouting at [[Elizabeth Eckford]], one of the [[Little Rock Nine]], during the [[Arkansas National Guard and the integration of Central High School|school integration crisis]]. In her later life, she sought to make amends for her behaviour, briefly becoming friends with Eckford.
== Little Rock High School incident ==
On September 4th, 1957, nine African-American students entered Little Rock Central High School as the school's first black students, including Elizabeth Eckford. On her way to the school, a group of white teenage girls followed Eckford, chanting "Two, four, six, eight! We don't want to integrate!"&lt;ref name = Telegraph&gt;{{cite web|last1=Margolick|first1=David|title=Elizabeth Eckford and Hazel Bryan: the story behind the photograph that shamed America|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/8813134/Elizabeth-Eckford-and-Hazel-Bryan-the-story-behind-the-photograph-that-shamed-America.html|website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=15 May 2015 | date=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these girls was Hazel Bryan. [[Benjamin Fine]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' later described her as "screaming, just hysterical, just like one of these Elvis Presley hysterical deals, where these kids are fainting with hysteria." Bryan is also credited as shouting, "Go home, nigger! Go back to Africa!"&lt;ref name = Telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2011/10/02/140953088/elizabeth-and-hazel-the-legacy-of-little-rock | title='Elizabeth And Hazel': The Legacy Of Little Rock | publisher=[[NPR]] | work=[[Weekend Edition Sunday]] | date=October 2, 2011 | accessdate=January 20, 2018 | author=NPR staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the photo became public, Hazel started to receive "critical" mail, all from the north. Author [[David Margolick]] wrote that while Hazel only found the criticism "surprising", "Hazel's parents, though, found her sudden notoriety sufficiently alarming to pull her out of the school."&lt;ref name = Margolick&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Margolick|first1=David| authorlink = David Margolick|title=Through a Lens, Darkly|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/09/littlerock200709|date=September 2007|publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryan left her new school when she was 17, married Antoine Massery and began a family. After that, her attitude toward [[Martin Luther King]] and the concept of desegregation changed. "Hazel Bryan Massery was curious, and reflective... One day, she realized, her children would learn that the snarling girl in their history books was their mother. She realized she had an account to settle."&lt;ref name = Lives/&gt;

In 1963, having changed her mind on integration and feeling guilt for her treatment of Eckford, Bryan contacted Eckford to apologize. They went their separate ways after this first meeting, and Eckford did not name the girl in the picture when asked about it by reporters.&lt;ref name=Margolick/&gt;

During the time after Little Rock, Hazel had become increasingly political, branching out into peace activism and social work.&lt;ref name = Telegraph/&gt; David Margolick discovered, "She taught mothering skills to unmarried black women, and took underprivileged black teenagers on field trips. She frequented the black history section at the local [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], buying books by [[Cornel West]] and [[Shelby Steele]] and the companion volume to ''[[Eyes on the Prize]]''."&lt;ref name=Margolick/&gt;

Bryan hoped her reputation could be gained back, but this did not happen until the 40th anniversary of Central’s desegregation in 1997. [[Will Counts]], the journalist who took the famous picture, arranged for Elizabeth and Hazel to meet again. The reunion provided an opportunity for acts of reconciliation, as noted in this editorial from the ''[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]'' on the first day of 1998:{{quote|One of the fascinating stories to come out of the reunion was the apology that Hazel Bryan Massery made to Elizabeth Eckford for a terrible moment caught forever by the camera. That 40-year-old picture of hate assailing grace &amp;mdash; which had gnawed at Ms. Massery for decades &amp;mdash; can now be wiped clean, and replaced by a snapshot of two friends. The apology came from the real Hazel Bryan Massery, the decent woman who had been hidden all those years by a fleeting image. And the graceful acceptance of that apology was but another act of dignity in the life of Elizabeth Eckford.&lt;ref name="gazette98"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070626142614/http://www.jenningsosbornefamily.com/news/itn0198.html Happy old year &amp;mdash; Thank you for 1997], editorial, ''Arkansas Democrat-Gazette'', January 1, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Friendship with Elizabeth Eckford ==
Despite feeling awkward when they first met, Eckford and Bryan surprisingly became friends afterwards:{{quote|They went to flower shows together, bought fabrics together, took mineral baths and massages together, appeared in documentaries and before school groups together. Since Elizabeth had never learned to drive, Hazel joked that she had become Elizabeth's chauffeur. Whenever something cost money, Hazel treated; it was awkward for Elizabeth, who had a hard time explaining to people just how poor she was.&lt;ref name=Margolick/&gt;}}

Soon after, the friendship began to fray. In 1999, David Margolick travelled to Little Rock and arranged to meet Elizabeth and Hazel. According to Hazel Bryan, she said, "I think she still… at times we have a little… well, the honeymoon is over and now we're getting to take out the garbage."&lt;ref name = Telegraph/&gt; As Eckford began to believe Bryan "wanted me to be cured and be over it and for this not to go on... She wanted me to be less uncomfortable so that she wouldn't feel responsible anymore." &lt;ref name = Lives&gt;{{cite web|last1=Margolick|first1=David|title=The Many Lives of Hazel Bryan|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2011/10/elizabeth_and_hazel_what_happened_to_the_two_girls_in_the_most_f.2.html|website=Slate|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other eight of the Little Rock Nine didn't want this friendship to last any longer. The friendship quietly dissolved in 1999, when Elizabeth Eckford wrote "True reconciliation can occur only when we honestly acknowledge our painful, but shared, past" on the brick of Central High. This message affected their friendship. The principal of Central High School stated "I just had hoped that I could show this picture and say, 'This happened, and that happened, and now…' and there is no 'now'." She added, "And that makes me sad. It makes me sad for them, it makes me sad for the future students at our school, and for the history books, because I'd like a happy ending. And we don't have that."&lt;ref name = Lives/&gt;

[[Common Sense Media]] gave the book a three out of five stars, saying, "Some portions of the book are more engaging than others.

The '''Jamestown Opera House''' is a historic government building and [[community centre|community center]] in the village of [[Jamestown, Ohio|Jamestown]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]].  It has been named a [[historic site]] because of its well-preserved architecture.  Besides serving as a theater, the opera house has functioned as the community's [[Seat of local government|village hall]], its [[fire station]], its [[post office]], and its [[library]].&lt;ref name=ohs&gt;{{OHC NRHP|07001093|Jamestown Opera House}}, [[Ohio Historical Society]], 2007.  Accessed 2012-12-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic context==
Established on 16 September 1823,&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|1988635}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamestown's first post office was conducted in conjunction with the postmaster's store.&lt;ref name=dills&gt;Dills, R.S.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gS4uAAAAYAAJ History of Greene County, Together with Historic Notes on the Northwest, and the State of Ohio]''.  [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]]: Odell and Mayer, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|781}}  For many years, the location of the post office was the subject of a community dispute; each postmaster moved it away from the location used by the previous postmaster, and one postmaster moved its location weekly, prompting comparisons to [[Circuit rider (religious)|circuit-riding Methodist preachers]].&lt;ref name=broadstone&gt;Broadstone, Michael A.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=txIVAAAAYAAJ History of Greene County, Ohio: Its People, Industries, and Institutions]''.  Vol. 1.  [[Indianapolis]]: Bowen, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|395}}  A library was functioning in the community by 1870, although its use was restricted to students in the village schools.&lt;ref name=dills /&gt;{{rp|783}}  When the community was [[plat]]ted, its main intersection was that of Limestone and Xenia Streets: Limestone was the north-south road connecting [[Urbana, Ohio]] with [[Maysville, Kentucky]], while Xenia was the east-west road from [[Xenia, Ohio|Xenia]] to [[Washington Court House, Ohio|Washington Court House]].  In Jamestown's early years, the southeastern corner of the intersection was occupied by a [[tavern]] that had been replaced with a store by the early 1880s.&lt;ref name=dills /&gt;{{rp|776}}  On this corner of the intersection, the Opera House was built in 1889.&lt;ref name=nris /&gt;  It was not originally built as a post office, but the office was moved to the Opera House after the size of the previous post office was discovered to be insufficient for [[rural delivery|Rural Free Delivery]] regulations.  It operated in this rôle until a purpose-built post office was constructed in 1902.&lt;ref name=broadstone /&gt;{{rp|396}}

==Architecture==
The Opera House is a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] structure designed by John W. McLean and the firm of Matthew Moorman.&lt;ref name=nris /&gt;  Its brick walls rest on a [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] of [[limestone]] and are covered with a combination [[roof shingle|shingle]]-and-[[fiberglass]] roof.&lt;ref name=ohs /&gt;  When it was built, the [[Local ordinance|ordinance]] for its construction provided that it be used only for government offices, causing problems when it began to be used for postal purposes.  Besides the offices for Jamestown's village government and for the officials of [[Silvercreek Township, Greene County, Ohio|Silvercreek Township]], the opera house was built with a substantial [[auditorium]] with a [[Stage (theatre)|stage]], as well as storage for [[Stagecraft|stage equipment]].&lt;ref name=broadstone /&gt;{{rp|396}}  It remained in its designed uses for less than half a century.&lt;ref name=ocfc&gt;[http://www.culture.ohio.gov/commission/detail.asp?id=721 Jamestown Opera House], Ohio Cultural Facilities Commission, n.d.  Accessed 2012-12-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
In 2007, the Jamestown Opera House was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its place in local history.  At the time, it was a work in progress, rather than being actively used for a specific purpose.  It's one of two [[Greene County, Ohio|Greene County]] opera houses on the Register, along with the [[Cedarville Opera House]] in [[Cedarville, Ohio|Cedarville]].&lt;ref name=nris /&gt;  Using more approximately $225,000 supplied by the state government in the late 2000s in two separate grants, workers installed new windows, improved the electrical and [[HVAC]] systems, and restored the exterior walls.  Another grant of $50,000 was used to repaint and restore the auditorium.  The renovation project concluded in 2010.&lt;ref name=ocfc /&gt;

The following are examples of [[retroactive continuities]] (or retcons).

==Film==
*''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), features [[Obi Wan Kenobi]] telling [[Luke Skywalker]] that [[Anakin Skywalker|Anakin Skywalker (Luke's father)]], was betrayed and killed by [[Darth Vader]]. The sequel film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), plot has Vader reveal himself as Anakin Skywalker (Luke's father). [[George Lucas]] decided to merge both characters while writing ''The Empire Strikes Back''. The following film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983) has Obi-Wan, justifying his original description of Vader having 'murdered' Anakin, as being truth from "a certain point of view" because from his point of view when Anakin became Vader he destroyed everything that was good about his former friend and apprentice. Similarly [[Princess Leia]] had been previously set as an upper-class romantic interest for the farm boy Luke; but in ''Empire Strikes Back'' Leia falls in love with [[Han Solo]], so in order to avoid a possible love triangle, ''Return of the Jedi'' reveals Leia as Luke Skywalker's twin sister (and therefore, daughter of Darth Vader), Lucas had originally planned Luke's sister to be a separate character, before deciding to accommodate it into the already established Leia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secrethistoryofstarwars.com/ |title=東京の婚活パーティーってどんなの？ |publisher=Secrethistoryofstarwars.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rogue One]]'' (2016) explains the improbable vulnerability of the [[Death Star]] in ''A New Hope'' to small rebel ships as a consequence of deliberate sabotage on the part of the key Death Star architect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vulture.com/2016/12/rogue-one-star-wars-retcon-death-star.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' (2015) the seventh entry of the ''[[Rocky (film series)|Rocky]]'' film series which serves as a sequel and spin-off to 2006's ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' (the sixth film), contains a major change into the continuity of the previous films. ''Creed'' establishes that during the events of ''[[Rocky IV]]'', Rocky's friend and rival [[Apollo Creed]] had an affair that resulted in a woman's pregnancy shortly before his boxing match against [[Ivan Drago]] during which Apollo dies on the ring. Months after the fight, the woman gives birth to [[Adonis Creed]], the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed. Adonis never meets his father and is the protagonist of the film ''Creed''; furthermore the film reveals Apollo won the fight at the end of ''[[Rocky III]]'' implying that that is the reason why Apollo agreed to fight Ivan Drago.&lt;ref&gt;http://screenrant.com/rocky-40th-anniversary-retcon/&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[Godzilla (franchise)#Heisei series (1984–1995)|Heisei]] and [[Godzilla (franchise)#Millennium series (1999–2004)|Millennium]] eras of the ''[[Godzilla]]'' film series, the events of the [[Godzilla (franchise)#Shōwa series (1954–1975)|Showa]] era after the [[Godzilla (1954 film)|original film]] never happened.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} In particular, each film in the Millennium series – except for ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'', which serves as the direct sequel to ''[[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]'' – serves as a direct sequel to the original 1954 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tohokingdom.com/articles/art_mill_conti.htm |title=Godzilla Millennium Series Continuity |publisher=Tohokingdom.com |date=2005-07-19 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', [[Jon Favreau]]'s son Max appears as a child wearing an Iron Man mask whom Stark saves from a drone. This was [[retcon|retroactively]] made the introduction of a young [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] to the MCU, as confirmed in June 2017 by eventual Spider-Man actor [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], [[Marvel Studios]] president [[Kevin Feige]] and ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' director [[Jon Watts]].&lt;ref name="PeterParker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-holland-officially-confirms-spider-man-was-in-iron-man-2_us_59508ea4e4b0da2c731c7080|title=Tom Holland Confirms Popular Fan Theory: Spider-Man Was In ‘Iron Man 2’|last=Bradley|first=Bill|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=June 26, 2017|accessdate=June 26, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6rVzoB543?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-holland-officially-confirms-spider-man-was-in-iron-man-2_us_59508ea4e4b0da2c731c7080|archivedate=June 26, 2017|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PeterParker2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/peter-parker-iron-man-2-jon-watts/|title=‘Spider-Man: Homecoming’ Director Jon Watts Explains Real Story Behind Peter Parker’s ‘Iron Man 2’ Cameo|last=Ryan|first=Mark|work=[[Uproxx]]|date=June 27, 2017|accessdate=June 27, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6rXDt2Exj?url=http://uproxx.com/movies/peter-parker-iron-man-2-jon-watts/|archivedate=June 27, 2017|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
*When [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] killed off his character [[Sherlock Holmes]] by plunging him to his death over the [[Reichenbach Falls]] with his nemesis [[Professor Moriarty]], the public's demand for Holmes was so great that Doyle was compelled to bring him back to life in a subsequent story, where he details that Holmes had merely faked his death.
*Though the term "retcon" did not yet exist when [[George Orwell]] wrote ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', the totalitarian regime depicted in that book is involved in a constant, large-scale retconning of past records. For example, when it is suddenly announced that "Oceania was not after all in war with Eurasia. Oceania was at war with Eastasia and Eurasia was an ally" (Part Two, Ch. 9), there is an immediate intensive effort to change "all reports and records, newspapers, books, pamphlets, films, sound-tracks and photographs" and make them all record a war with Eastasia rather than one with Eurasia. "Often it was enough to merely substitute one name for another, but any detailed report of events demanded care and imagination. Even the geographical knowledge needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable." See [[historical revisionism (negationism)]].
*When [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the character of ''[[Sauron|The Necromancer]]'' was not originally intended to be more than an abstract "bad guy" concept because ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' had not yet been conceived.  However, as Tolkien developed ''The Lord of the Rings'', the abstract ''Necromancer'' came to be "discovered" to be [[Sauron]].

==Television==

*In 2004, ''[[Coronation Street]]'' retconned the Baldwin family after [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]]'s nephew [[Danny Baldwin|Danny]] and wife [[Frankie Baldwin|Frankie]] moved to the area from [[Essex]], with their two sons [[Jamie Baldwin|Jamie]] and [[Warren Baldwin|Warren]]. Mike had been portrayed as an only child prior to this moment, with [[Frank "Frankie" Baldwin|his father]] appearing in the program between 1980 and 1982 to confirm the notion.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
*''[[First of the Summer Wine]]'', the prequel to the long-running British sitcom ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'', retconned the character Seymour Utterthwaite as a pre-World War II friend of the other central characters. Seymour had been introduced into later series of ''Last of the Summer Wine'' and was previously unknown to the stalwart characters, Compo and Clegg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First of the Summer Wine, Uncovered |url=http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/ozfan.htm |accessdate=23 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213082703/http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/ozfan.htm |archivedate=February 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The revived series of British science fiction television program ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and its television [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s use retroactive continuity as a plot device. 
**Show runner [[Steven Moffat]]'s [[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|fifth series finale]] depicted the Doctor [[reset button technique|rebooting the universe]]. In answer to a fan's question, Moffat tweeted: "The whole universe came exactly as it was. Except for any continuity errors I need to explain away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/steven_moffat/status/80157148893556736 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120724045625/http://twitter.com/steven_moffat/status/80157148893556736 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 July 2012 |title=Steven Moffat: ...The whole universe... |work=Steven Moffat on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date=13 June 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**In the [[Doctor Who (series 6)|sixth series]], Moffat introduces new aliens the [[Silence (Doctor Who)|Silence]], who erase your memory of them the moment you look away. Commenting on this device, writer [[MaryAnn Johanson]] writes, "That could be happening throughout this story... indeed, through the entire history of ''Doctor Who''. Moffat has just created a pretty much unassailable narratively sound reason for inserting retcons ''anywhere'' throughout the half-century history of the show."{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
**In the [[The Name of the Doctor|seventh series finale]], Moffat creates a hitherto unknown incarnation of the Doctor known as the [[War Doctor]] in the run-up to the show's 50th anniversary special "[[The Day of the Doctor]]".&lt;ref name="HurtDoctor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/doctor-who/10065201/Doctor-Who-The-Name-of-the-Doctor-BBC-One-review.html|title=Doctor Who: The Name of the Doctor, BBC One, review|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 May 2013|accessdate=22 May 2013|author=Hogan, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is shown in the mini-episode "[[The Night of the Doctor]]" [[retroactive continuity|retroactively inserted]] into the show's fictional chronology between the [[Eighth Doctor|Eighth]] and [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] Doctors, although his introduction was written so as not to disturb the established numerical naming of the Doctors.&lt;ref name="HurtDoctorNumber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a533505/doctor-who-steven-moffat-on-regeneration-limit.html?rss|title='Doctor Who': Steven Moffat on regeneration limit|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=24 November 2013|accessdate=25 November 2013|author=Rigby, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 50th anniversary special "[[The Day of the Doctor]]", Moffat revealed, that at the last instant of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], the Doctor hid his war-torn home planet in time, rather than destroy it.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}
** In the ''Doctor Who'' spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'', created by [[Russell T Davies]], a drug used to erase the memory of characters is called "retcon"; the use of the drug is often referred to by characters as "retconning".{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==''Star Trek'' in various media==

*When ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' was released in 1979, [[Gene Roddenberry]] claimed that the radically different appearance of the [[Klingon]]s in the film was how they were always supposed to have looked, but they did not have the budget for it in the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In the 1990s, an episode of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' featured three Klingon characters from the original series, made to fit the new look. However, the later episode "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]", used footage from the original series with old-look Klingons; Commander [[Worf]] acknowledged their different appearance, saying it was "a long story" and, after receiving incredulous looks, added with a scowl "we do not discuss it with outsiders."
*A 2005, two-episode arc of ''Star Trek: Enterprise'', "[[Affliction (Enterprise episode)|Affliction]]"/"[[Divergence (Enterprise episode)|Divergence]]", revealed that the Klingons that appeared in the 1960s episodes were the product of genetic engineering using augmented human [[genes]]. This explanation was used in [[Shane Johnson (author)|Shane Johnson]]'s 1989 ''The Worlds of the Federation'': "The 'Klingons' encountered along the Federation border with the Empire were a Klingon-human fusion, genetically created to infiltrate the Federation. The interception of the Amar transmission during the V'Ger incident revealed the true nature of the Imperial Klingon race and stunned Federation science. Before that time, no one had suspected the Klingons were capable of such advanced genetic engineering, and a great deal of rethinking was done concerning the level of Klingon technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Shane|last2=Punchatz|first2=Don Ivan|title=The Worlds of the Federation|date=1989|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York|isbn=9780671708139|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; John M.

*The chronology of ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series was subject to much debate among fans until an official timeline was printed in the collector's book ''[[The Legend of Zelda#Fictional chronology|Hyrule Historia]]'', released in Japan on December 21, 2011.&lt;ref name="Official Legend of Zelda Timeline Revealed"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://gamecrunch.co/2011/12/22/official-legend-of-zelda-timeline-revealed/ |title=Official Legend of Zelda Timeline Revealed |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2011-12-22 |accessdate=2016-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426070944/http://gamecrunch.co/2011/12/22/official-legend-of-zelda-timeline-revealed/ |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16596/features/zelda-timeline-explained/ |title=Nintendo of Europe &amp;#124; Nintendo |publisher=Officialnintendomagazine.co.uk |date=2015-08-15 |accessdate=2015-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031155115/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16596/features/zelda-timeline-explained/ |archivedate=2014-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyrule Historia contains a timeline that explains how each game fits within the storyline. This includes introducing a three-way split after ''Ocarina of Time''. ''The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword'' helps explain the appearance of multiple Zelda, Link and Ganondorf characters across hundreds of years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
*The original ''[[Ninja Gaiden]]'' trilogy for the NES was followed years later by a new series of sequels produced by [[Team Ninja]] beginning with ''[[Ninja Gaiden (2004 video game)|Ninja Gaiden]]'' for the Xbox in 2004. However, the second generation of ''Ninja Gaiden'' video games, being prequels to original series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mielke |first=James |url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3164447 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522141623/http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3164447 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-22 |title=Ninja Gaiden 2 Preview for 360 from |publisher=1UP.com |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2015-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yin |first=Wesley |url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/ninja_gaiden_2/preview-948.html |title=Ninja Gaiden 2 Interview for Xbox 360 |publisher=VideoGamer.com |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081205161412/http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/ninjagaidenii/news.html?sid=6191514&amp;part=rss&amp;subj=6191514 ]&lt;/ref&gt; has many differences from the NES trilogy. The character design of [[Ryu Hayabusa]] in the new games is now based on the ''[[Dead or Alive (franchise)|Dead or Alive]]'' incarnation of the character with long hair and green eyes, the character design of Ryu's father, Ken Hayabusa, has been updated as well, the character now being addressed in the English versions by his original name in the Japanese versions (Jo Hayabusa), and producer Tomonobu Itagaki hints at the possibility that Sonia, a character from the new games, might be Irene Lew from the original series.&lt;ref name="gamespot1"/&gt; With the release of ''[[Dead or Alive: Dimensions]]'' in 2011, it has been revealed that Sonia is indeed Irene Lew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video game | title = Dead or Alive: Dimensions | developer = Team Ninja| publisher = Tecmo| date = 2011-05-24| platform = Nintendo 3DS| version = 1.0| level = Chapter 2| quote = '''Ryu Hayabusa''': Hayate, meet Irene /...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a-mn2EVpFI&amp;t=10m7s |title=Dead or Alive Dimensions Nintendo 3DS Chronicle Mode Chapter 2 Part 3 |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[Metal Gear (video game)|Metal Gear]]'', the character [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]] serves as [[Solid Snake]]'s commanding officer and is apparently revealed near the end of the game to also be the main antagonist. However, ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'' establishes the antagonist character to actually be a body double of the real Big Boss, called Venom Snake, who is killed by Solid Snake during this encounter. The original Big Boss later becomes the antagonist in the series' second entry, ''[[Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title= Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain |developer= Kojima Productions |publisher= Konami |date= 2015-09-01 |platform= PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PC |version= |scene= |level= Truth: The Man Who Sold The World |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ignored sequels in various media==

*The film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' loosely continues the storylines of ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and ''[[Superman II]]'', and disregards the events of ''[[Superman III]]'' and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=superman-returns |title=Movies |publisher=Superman Homepage |date= |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]'' is the only entry in the series that does not feature the series antagonist [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], nor does it include story elements from either ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) or ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981). In fact, it treats the first film and, apparently, its sequel as [[Story within a story#Film within a film|fictional films]], as one of the characters watches a trailer for the original during the film; additionally, the film's tagline is a reference to the tagline from the original as well. The film ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' is a direct sequel to ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' and ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'', dismissing the events that take place in the sequels ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]'', ''[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers]]'' and ''[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers]]''. The subsequent film ''[[Halloween: Resurrection]]'' follows the new continuity of ''Halloween H20'', however, it retcons that film's ending in order to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karina Wilson |url=http://www.horrorfilmhistory.com/index.php?pageID=1970s |title=Horror Film History — Horror Films in the 1970s |publisher=Horrorfilmhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 film, [[Halloween (2018 film)|''Halloween'']], will be a direct sequel to the [[Halloween (1978 film)|original film]] while disregarding the previous sequels from [[canon (fiction)|canon]], and [[retcon]]ing the ending of the first film.&lt;ref name="DontPeople"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/danny-mcbride-halloween-just-hope-dont-fk-piss-people-off-183213419.html |title=Danny McBride on 'Halloween': 'I just hope that we don't f*** it up and piss people off' |last=Bierly |first=Mandi |date=2017-11-13 |website=[[Yahoo!]] |access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The film ''[[The Exorcist III]]'' is a sequel to ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', and ignores the events of ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/64113/the-exorcist-iii.html |title=The Exorcist III (2015), directed by William Peter Blatty &amp;#124; Film review |publisher=Timeout.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Highlander II: The Quickening]]'' is a sequel to the first film, but its events are ignored by later films in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qwipster.net/highlander3.htm |title=Highlander: The Final Dimension review (1994) Highlander 3 - Qwipster's Movie Reviews |publisher=Qwipster.net |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''[[Highlander: Endgame]]'' ignores the events of both ''Highlander II'' and ''[[Highlander III: The Sorcerer]]'' and only follows the events of the [[Highlander: The Series|TV series]] and the first film.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
*''[[Texas Chainsaw 3D]]'' and its prequel ''[[Leatherface (2017 film)|Leatherface]]'' follow the continuity of ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', ignoring the events of the other sequels.
*The fifth film in the [[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator series]], ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' (2015), completely disregards the events of the third and fourth Terminator films, ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' (2003) and ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' (2009). In the upcoming [[Terminator 6|sixth Terminator film]] in 2019, ''Terminator Genisys'' itself will be ignored, in addition to ignoring the 2003 and 2009 sequels. Only the [[The Terminator|original 1984 film]] and the first sequel ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991) will be considered canon to the 2019 film.

[[File:Monumenta Germaniae Historica.png|thumb|''Monumenta Germaniae Historica''.]]
The '''''Monumenta Germaniae Historica''''' (frequently abbreviated '''MGH''' in bibliographies and lists of sources) is a comprehensive series of carefully edited and published [[primary source]]s, both [[chronicle]] and [[Archives|archival]], for the study of [[History of Germany|German history]] (broadly conceived) from the end of the [[Roman Empire]] to 1500.&lt;ref name=Holland1910&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the name, the series covers important sources for the history of many countries besides Germany, since the Society for the Publication of Sources on Germanic Affairs of the Middle Ages has included documents from many other areas subjected to the influence of Germanic tribes or rulers (Britain, Czech lands, Poland, Austria, France, Low Countries, Italy, Spain, etc.).  The editor from 1826 until 1874 was [[Georg Heinrich Pertz]] (1795–1876); in 1875 he was succeeded by [[Georg Waitz]] (1813-1886) .

==History==
The MGH was founded in Hanover as a private [[text publication society]] by the [[Prussia]]n reformer [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Heinrich Friedrich Karl Freiherr vom Stein]] in 1819. The first volume appeared in 1826. The editor from 1826 until 1874 was [[Georg Heinrich Pertz]], who was succeeded by [[Georg Waitz]]. Many eminent medievalists from Germany and, eventually, other countries, joined in the project of searching out and comparing manuscripts and producing scholarly editions. The motto chosen, ''Sanctus amor patriae dat animum'' ("Holy love for the fatherland gives the spirit") is explained as linking [[Romantic nationalism]] with professional scholarship. In 1875, the MGH was established as a more formal institution with headquarters in [[Berlin]]. 

In 1935, the organization was taken over by the state and renamed the ''Reichsinstitut für ältere deutsche Geschichtskunde'' (National Institute for Older German History). This was abolished in 1945, at the end of [[World War II]]. 

However, the institute was subsequently revived under its original name with the support of German institutions and the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Knowles 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; The Monumenta Germaniae Historica Institute has been located in Munich since 1949 and possesses a large specialized library on the medieval history of Germany and Europe, including Church history, along with 130,000 monographs and approximately 150,000 dependent writings.&lt;!--Inhaltlich deckt die Bibliothek bzw. der frei zugängliche OPAC die mittelalterliche Geschichte Deutschlands und Europas mit Berücksichtigung der Kirchengeschichte ab. Der OPAC weist neben 130.000 Monographien auch ca. 150.000 unselbständige Schriften nach.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bib-bvb.de/bib_schule/infoblatt4-geschichte-theologie.pdf |title=BibliotheksVerbund Bayern |accessdate=2008-09-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721100240/http://www.bib-bvb.de/bib_schule/infoblatt4-geschichte-theologie.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It moved into its current premises in the building of the [[Bavarian State Library]] in 1967.

The project, a major effort of historical scholarship, continues in the 21st century. In 2004 the MGH, with the support of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], made all of its publications in print for more than five years available online, in photo-digital reproduction, via a link on the MGH homepage.

==Divisions==
The series falls into five main divisions, ''Antiquitates'', ''Diplomata'', ''Epistolae'', ''Leges'' and ''Scriptores'', with an additional smaller division of ''Necrologia''. Many subsidiary series have also been established, including a series of more compact volumes for school use (''Scriptores in usum scholarum'') and special studies (''MGH Schriften'').

'''Musethica''' is a non-governmental organization that introduces a new concept of education to classical music performance. The central objective of Musethica is to create a model for excellent music students to perform on a regular basis for different audiences as an integral part of their education.

A small, carefully selected group of young musicians participate in master classes conducted by world-renowned musicians, which often perform together with the young musicians.

The concerts comprise the finest repertoire of chamber music from solo performances to octet, and the young musicians receive no fee for their performances.

The concerts take place at a great variety of locations within the community: schools of special education, hospitals, psychiatric centers, prisons, centers for the homeless, community centers, social enterprises and other places.

The model provides the students with the opportunity to play a huge number of yearly concerts which tremendously improves their musical and instrumental abilities and brings joy and happiness to many children and adults during the academic school year.&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Post, (10.15.2015) “Musethica hath power for one and all” http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Music-hath-power-for-one-and-all-426012&lt;/ref&gt; it is a new element in music education,&lt;ref&gt;García, R. (2015): “Como preparar con éxito un concierto o audición”, Redbook Ediciones, Barcelona, pp. 175-177&lt;/ref&gt; an element which was missing in the official curriculum of young performing musicians.

== History ==
The Musethica concept was conceived in 2009 by the violist [[Avri Levitan]] and was officially launched in 2012 in [[Zaragoza]], Spain under the auspices of Levitan and Professor Carmen Marcuello. As of 2017, Musethica has five active associations: in Spain, Germany, Israel, Poland and Sweden. Musethica is also active in France, China and Austria.

==Plot==
{{more plot|date=August 2013}}
Child psychologist Samuel Faulkner has an ideal romance with ballet teacher Rebecca Taylor. Rebecca is thinking about marriage and children. Samuel is against the idea of marriage as he is happy with how things are between them. This all changes when Rebecca declares she is pregnant, and when questioned by Samuel about her birth control she replies birth control is only 97% effective.

Samuel's fears mount due to his encounters with overbearing couple Marty and Gail Dwyer and their unruly daughters, as well as the confusing advice he gets from Sean, his perpetually single artist friend and Gail's brother. Samuel is confused and unsure about what to do. Feeling neglected, Rebecca leaves him and moves in with Marty and Gail. Samuel tries to contact her but she does not respond.

When a girl makes a move on Samuel, he declines, saying he's not ready to move on yet. When he sees an ultrasound of his soon-to-be-born son, he decides that it is time to take responsibility before it is too late. He sells his [[Porsche 911]], buys a family van, and gets back together with Rebecca. They then marry and have their baby together.&lt;ref&gt;http://whataboutpregnancy.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film was poorly received by critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 26% based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 4.4/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nine Months (1995)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nine_months/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two stars, saying, "''Nine Months'' is one of those movies where the outcome is abundantly clear to everyone but the hero, who remains in the hapless position of playing dumb because, if he didn't, there wouldn't be a plot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Review: Nine Months |last = Ebert | first = Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950712/REVIEWS/507120301/1023 |date= 1995-07-12 | accessdate = 2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
The movie debuted at #3 at the box office behind ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' and ''[[Under Siege 2: Dark Territory]]'' with $12.5 million in its opening weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : 'Under Siege' Opens in No. 2 Spot |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1995-07-18|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-18/entertainment/ca-25014_1_weekend-gross|accessdate=2011-01-13|first=Elaine|last=Dutka}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nine Months'' went on to gross $138.5 million worldwide.

===Hugh Grant's Opinion===
Hugh Grant has spoken disparagingly of his performance in ''Nine Months'', stating in an interview with the [[SAG-AFTRA]] Foundation that: {{quote| "I really ruined it. And it was entirely my fault. I panicked, it was such a big jump up from what I'd been paid before to what they were offering me. And the scale was inhuman to my standards, you know the scale of the production, [[20th Century Fox]], the whole thing. And I just tried much too hard, and you know I forgot to do basic acting things, like mean it. So I pulled faces and overacted, it was a shocker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3lUJt4KmJw&amp;t=2885s| title=Conversations with Hugh Grant| author=SAG-AFTRA Foundation| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2016-08-16| access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On another occasion, he referred to director Chris Columbus as a "genius" and his "brilliant" co-stars, but further commented: {{quote|"You know, having been paid ₤20,000 or whatever it was, to do ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', if you're suddenly paid millions, you think well I better ramp up my performance by 200 times. But all that means is that you overact grotesquely, which is what I did. So I'm always very apologetic to those people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7Z0MNq4T9Q&amp;t=1190s| title=Hugh Grant in Conversation BAFTA New York| author=BAFTA New York| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2016-09-06| access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''No Home Movie''''' is a French-Belgian 2015 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Chantal Akerman]], focusing on conversations between the film-maker and her mother just months before her mother's death. The film premiered at the [[Locarno Film Festival]] on 10 August 2015. It is Akerman's last film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Debruge | first =Peter | title ="Film Review: No Home Movie" | publisher = ''Variety'' | date =10 August 2015 | url =https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/no-home-movie-film-review-1201566469/ | accessdate = 24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The documentary consists of "conversations—whether in person in a neat kitchen, or over Skype from abroad—"  between Akerman and her mother Natalia, who was a survivor of [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref name= "NYT"&gt;{{Citation | last =Rapold | first =Nicolas | title ="Chantal Akerman Takes Emotional Path in Film About 'Maman'" | publisher =''The New York Times'' | date =5 August 2015 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/arts/international/chantal-akerman-takes-emotional-path-in-film-about-maman.html | accessdate = 24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halfway through the film, Akerman cuts to a succession of traveling shots of a desert, which "cleave(s) the movie in two."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Dargis | first =Manohla | title =Review: ‘No Home Movie,’ of Love and Melancholy | publisher = ''The New York Times'' | date =31 March 2016 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/movies/review-no-home-movie-of-love-and-melancholy.html | access-date = 4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Filming ran several months. Her mother died shortly after filming ended, at the age of 86, in April 2014. Akerman whittled down around forty hours' worth of footage to 115 minutes; she used small handheld cameras and her [[BlackBerry]] to film. "I think if I knew I was going to do this, I wouldn’t have dared to do it," Akerman in an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name= "NYT"/&gt; Akerman died on 5 October 2015 in Paris. ''[[Le Monde]]'' reported that she committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=monde&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cinema/article/2015/10/06/la-cineaste-chantal-akerman-est-morte_4783566_3476.html|author=Isabelle Regnier|title=La cinéaste Chantal Akerman est morte|publisher=''Le Monde''|date=6 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==

The film premiered in the United States at the [[New York Film Festival]] on 7 October 2015, where it was described as "an extremely intimate film but also one of great formal precision and beauty, one of the rare works of art that is both personal and universal, and as much a masterpiece as her 1975 career-defining ''[[Jeanne Dielman|Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =Main Slate: ''No Home Movie'' | publisher =The Film Society of Lincoln Center | year =2015 | url =http://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2015/films/no-home-movie/ | accessdate = 24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scene, in particular, where the two "sit at the kitchen table, eating potatoes that Ms. Akerman has prepared, telling her mother that even she, the peripatetic artist, has mastered a few domestic skills" highlights, as one ''New York Times'' reviewer suggests, "the moment as a reference to a memorable potato-peeling scene" from ''Jeanne''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Donadio | first =Rachel | title =The Director’s Director: Chantal Akerman | publisher =''The New York Times'' | date =25 March 2016 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/movies/the-directors-director-chantal-akerman.html | access-date = 26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''On Social Freedom: or the Necessary Limits of Individual Freedom Arising Out of the Conditions of Our Social Life''' is an essay regarding individual and societal freedom initially thought to have been written by the British philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]],&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Oswald. "On Social Freedom." In Oxford and Cambridge Review (London: Archibald Constable &amp; Co. Ltd., 1907) pp. 57-83.&lt;/ref&gt; but later found to have been falsely attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, J.C. ''Mill and His Early Critics'' (Leicester: University College, 1956), pp. 38-54&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovered in 1907 among the possessions left in the home at which Mill died in [[Avignon, France]], it was published in June 1907 as a special article in [[The Oxford and Cambridge Review]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford and Cambridge Review on Google Books, "John Stuart Mill: On Social Freedom: or the Necessary Limits of Individual Freedom Arising Out of the Conditions of Our Social Life", June 1907&lt;/ref&gt;  The work was republished by Columbia University Press in 1941, but failed to attract much attention. In 1955, the Liberal Arts Press intended to republish it in a volume also containing ''[[On Liberty]]'', but decided against doing so in view of the doubts surrounding its authorship raised by the Mill scholar J.C. Rees. He then set out the full case against attributing the work to Mill in his 1956 work ''Mill and His Early Critics''.

Rees's explanation for how the manuscript ended up among Mill's possessions is summarised by J.P. Scanlan:&lt;ref&gt;Scanlan, J.P. "J.S. Mill and the Definition of Freedom", Ethics, Vol. 68, No. 3 (University of Chicago Press, April 1958), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In September, 1862, Mill wrote a letter from Avignon to a certain E.R. Edger, acknowledging receipt of a manuscript entitled "Social Freedom." Apparently Edger hoped to elicit from Mill an appraisal of his capacity for philosophical inquiry, and had sent the manuscript as a sample of his work. Mill replies politely and with his usual care that he finds many signs of competence in the work - mostly, however, in the form of "promise rather than performance" - and he exhorts Edger to continue thinking and writing, though not "to the neglect of other modes of gaining a subsistence." Concerining Edger's views Mill says only that, if he were to comment in detail, he "should have much to say against several of your positions, and especially against your definition of liberty."&lt;ref&gt;The Letters of John Stuart Mill, ed. Hugh S.R. Elliot (London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1910), Volume 1, pp. 259-61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The letter is included in Mill's ''Collected Works''&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Vol. XV: The Later Letters 1849-1873 Part II, (University of Toronto Press 1963), p. 792&lt;/ref&gt; where Edger is identified as "probably Ebenezer R. Edger, associate of [[George Holyoake|G.J. Holyoake]] in the promoting of the [[history of the cooperative movement|co-operative movement]], writer for ''The Secular World'' and author of tracts on co-operation." Holyoake briefly mentions Edger in ''The History of Co-operation'':&lt;ref&gt;Holyoake, George Jacob, The History of Co-operation (T. Fisher Unwin, 1906 [Vol. 1: 1875, Vol. 2: 1879])&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ten years later my colleague, Mr E. R. Edger, visited Mr. Crisell, the manager of the farm whom the Rev. Mr. Robinson had found to be "manly, open, and ingenious appearance," beyond what he expected of one belonging to the "depressed" class. Mr. Edger sent me this report:-

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I paid a visit to Assington, and had a conversation with the manager, Mr. Crisell (pronounced with i long, 'Cry-sell').  I can feel no enthusiasm at all about the Assington Farm.  There seems no 'co-operation' in the right sense of the term, but only ''bounty'' of the squire towards poor neighbours.

(1) It is limited to inhabitants of the parish.
(2) Each member can hold only one share.
(3) Members have no voice in the management.
(4) Wages to workmen same as usual.
(5) No special inducement offered to the workmen to become shareholders.  The manager remarked that they did not care particularly to employ the members; this seems to me very significant.
It has been in existence forty-one years, so it will take a long time to renovate society that way.  Remember, I only give my impressions."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An E.R. Edger is also listed in The British Medical Journal on the 24th of April 1869 as having passed a primary examination in anatomy and physiology at the Royal College of Surgeons of England.&lt;ref&gt;The British Medical Journal, April 24, 1869, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paraguayan Indian art''' is the visual art created by the [[indigenous peoples of Paraguay]]. While indigenous artists embrace contemporary Western art media, their arts also include [[pre-Columbian]] art forms. Indian art of aboriginal origin includes ceramics, baskets, weaving and threading, feather art and leather work. Indian art of a hybrid nature includes the embroideries, lace, woodcarving and different metal products. [[Paraguay]] is particularly known for its indigenous featherwork and [[basket weaving]].&lt;ref name=para&gt;[http://country.paraguay.com/arts_and_culture/indigenous_art.php "Indigenous art."] ''Paraguay.com'' (retrieved 13 July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Handmade products==
The handmade products of Paraguay are of a great variety and comprise ceramic articles, as well as embroideries and sewn articles, as well as wood, baskets, leather work and silver work. Pre-Columbian ceramics made in the Paraguayan territory were rustic and made from terracotta clay. They were painted in red, and occasionally in black and white. The clay used to be worked by hand.  Some tribes incised their pottery with decorations before firing.

The Spanish, especially the [[Jesuit]]s, influenced the technical level of production and the finishing of the native ceramics.  These had been characterized by extreme simplicity and production of functional goods.  The Jesuits taught the Indian population in the missions.

Ceramic products produced today by some Indian groups include jars, flower vases, and some without specific shapes, as well as water vases. Among those, the pottery most widely sold today due to its beauty and quality comes from Tobaty and Ita.

==By media==
===Baskets weaving===
Baskets are woven from the fibers of canes. Paraguayan Indians weave open baskets, baskets with handles, hand fans, shades, place mats, and especially ''piri'', the typical Paraguayan hat of the country men. Leather products, such as bags, hats, sacks, etc. have their main centers in Limpio and Luque, where also centers for production of beautiful baskets. Materials for [[wickerwork]] include indigenous [[bromeliad]]s including [[tacuarembó]] and [[caraguatá]], as well as [[pindo palm]] leaves.&lt;ref name=para/&gt;

The rich Indian basket production of Paraguay is dividing by plantations. For example, in some communities where the main crop is [[cassava]], baskets are solid with great storage capacity. The ''ajaka mbya'' basket is an average of 35 centimeters diameter with rigid supports that can to hold the heavy weight of the cassavas.

The ''ajak'' is a basket made by weaving ''tacuarembo'' and dark ''guembepi'', making braided figures as well as geometric ones, in accordance with the Guaraní concept of beauty. The baskets associated with the production of corn are smaller and lighter and are constructed from [[Butia|pindo palm tree]] leaves.

===Ceramics===
Ceramics are an ancient art form in Paraguay, and ancient ceramics have been preserved through the centuries. Ceramics range from the utilitarian—cooking vessels, water jugs—to the sacred, such as funerary urns.&lt;ref name=para/&gt;

===Featherwork===
A precolumbian art form, featherwork provides distinctive personal adornment. Brilliantly colored feathers are fashioned into anklets, bracelets, collars, headdresses, and even entire cloaks. [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] [[medicine men]] used to wear full feather cloaks. The Guaraní create feather [[headdress]]es called ''jeguaka'' worn during ceremonial occasions.&lt;ref name=para/&gt;

===Textile arts===
[[Image:Nanduti lace.jpg|thumb|[[Ñandutí]] lace from [[Asunción]], Paraguay]]
Indian embroidery, weaving, and other textile art are an important source of income for the domestic economy. Before the arrival of the Spanish, the Indians used a horizontal piece of material to make hammocks with cotton threads, as well as the baskets and bags to transport food and nets for fishing and hunting.

Later on they also knitted ponchos and other clothing items. As with ceramics, the Jesuits also introduced new techniques in this area, using the vertical frame to make the threads. Tribal artisans began producing sheets, towels, blankets, table clothes and other articles, as well as the special hammocks, which were knitted and still are with cotton threads and ornaments on the sides.

New technical resources brought by the Spanish inspired the typical cotton dresses, the ones called ''ao poi'', made with a fine thread, and the ''povyi'', a little wider thread weaving, as well as linen, and the beautiful ''ñanduti'', which means "spider web" in [[Guaraní language]] and consists of fine embroidery, with which table clothes, curtains, blouses and more are made.

The most coveted textiles are the [[Ñandutí]] embroideries made in the cities of [[Guarambaré]] and [[Itauguá]]. Woven ponchos, known for their beauty and quality, are made by the ethnic groups [[Sanapana|Lengua]], [[Toba (tribe)|Maskoy]], [[Nivaclé]], and [[Wichí]] from the [[Gran Chaco]]. They use sheep wool tinted in red and the ones called of 60 lists, made in [[Pirayú]] and [[Yataity]], in the [[Guairá Department]].

===Rock art===
Ancient indigenous peoples of Paraguay carved [[petroglyph]]s into stone, particularly in the hills of [[Amambay Department]].&lt;ref name=rockart&gt;[http://www.solarmapproject.com/inscriptions/ "The Theme."] ''Solar Map Project." Retrieved 6 Jan 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Woodcarving===
Wood is carved into ceremonial masks, smoking pipes, chairs known as ''apyká'', and anthropomorphic and zoomorphic effigies.&lt;ref name=para/&gt; Gourds are also carves with images.

==By tribe==
===Chamacoco===
The [[Chamacoco language|Chamacoco]] ethnic group, from the [[Alto Paraguay Department]], used dresses during their annual ritual called ''Debylyby.'' These are knitted of special fibers.  Associated masks are carved from the karaguata tree and adorned with feathers from Chaco birds.

The Chamacocos used a ''pupo'', a protective vest made of karaguata. The ''pupo'' is knitted when the fibers are wet; these become rigid when dry and can serve as armor.  They protected the wearer from the arrows of the enemies.

===Karaguata===
The weaving of Karaguata is an important element of the Indian art. It is an expression of the Indian people of the Gran Chaco. The bags of Karaguata are some of the most common applications of fiber twining. Collector's bags are mainly used by women, who carry them on their backs and have a form of a large half moon. Hunting bags are smaller, rectangular, carried by men on their shoulders.

===Paï-Tavytera===
The [[Pai Tavytera people|Pai Tavytera]] from Eastern Paraguay and Brazil are known for their necklaces made from carved wood and colorful seeds of different fruits.&lt;ref&gt;Flowers, Nancy M. [http://www.everyculture.com/South-America/Pa-Tavytera.html Paï-Tavytera.] ''Every Culture.'' (retrieved 29 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; They use ''urucú'', a red dye made from ''[[Bixa orellana]]'' for [[body painting]]. Personal adornment is made from feathers, such as those of the [[toucan]], and cotton. [[Labret]]s are made from resin. Men typically weave baskets, while women make ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Flowers, Nancy M. "[http://www.everyculture.com/South-America/Pa-Tavytera.html Paï-Tavytera]." Countries and Their Cultures.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also being consulted in interpreting ancient rock art in Amambay.&lt;ref name=rockart/&gt;

===Toba-Qom===
The [[Toba (tribe)|Toba]] tribe makes textiles from colorful wool threads, as well as the traditional bags, ''piri'' hats and [[Trithrinax|carandilla]] leaf baskets.
[[Image:Guaranies-artesanias.JPG|thumb|350px|right|Guaraní artisan selling craftwork at a Jesuit Mission]]

===Mbayá===
The [[Mbayá]] Indians have a special ability in making baskets of natural ''tacuara'', that are decorated with drawings of ''Guembepi'' and animals of the zone, as well as their necklaces and wood carving.

===Ayoreo===
The ''ayoreos bagas'' are one of the coveted Indian handiwork. These bags are made with karaguata fibers and exemplify rustic Indian beauty in its conception. The adherence to traditional aesthetics makes them extremely attractive. The [[Ayoreo language|Ayoreo]] also make dishes and spoons of [[Bursera graveolens|Palo Santo]] wood and feather art.

===Maka===
The members of the Maka tribe are excellent weavers. Their traditional blankets, belts, and other elements are knitted with colorful threads.

===Ava Guaraní===
[[Ava Guaraní]] are highly skilled at making baskets and hammocks. They use karaguata fibers, as well as guembepi for baskets that represent a novelty in the Indian work of the country.

==Social context==
The art produced by these two ways of living, nomadic and sedentary, reflect the difference of each one. The communities based in the recollection system are nomads. Therefore, their lifestyle allows for a more flexible and open culture, with many adaptations. In the other extreme, the Guaraní agricultural society is very attached to the land and its natural cycles, and naturally presents a conservative tendency, which can be closed to innovations. They distinguish their own from the other's property and have ongoing issues about the need to absorb or reject the foreign influences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fallsworld.com/cultura_guarani.htm Guaraní Culture.] 2008 (retrieved 29 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the differences in these societies and the special characteristics of each one, scholars say that it is possible to establish some shared elements in all Indian communities who live or have lived in Paraguay. Indian art – through its symbols and the free exercise of tribal languages – is one of the most important manifestations of indigenous culture in Paraguay.

==Ceremonies and rituals==
[[File:Guarani shaman.JPG|thumb|[[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] [[medicine man|spiritual leader]] with ceremonial gourd rattle and cross, 2006]]
Both the collectors and the agricultural societies have as a social nucleus, a mythical body-ritual, from where they can articulate and develop political power, in the judicial order, free time, beauty, and religion.

The mythical [[axis mundi]]-ritual, in essence the Indian cosmology, is composed of communal ceremonies. These are the moments when the community, through songs, dances and rites, show their identity. Indian art finds its first fundamental origins in those ceremonies and in the human body–its principal support. Feathers use in ornamentation, tattoos, and body paintings in the case of the Chaco Indians and the feather art among the Guaraní constitute basic elements of the Indian art in Paraguay.

==Museums==
A number of museums are dedicated to showcased indigenous Paraguayan art. These include the [[Guido Boggiani Museum]] in [[San Lorenzo, Paraguay|San Lorenzo]] and in [[Asunción]], the [[Andrés Barbero Ethnographic Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museobarbero.org.py/pagina_nueva_5i.htm "Etnographic Museum Andrés Barbero."] (retrieved 13 July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Museum of Indigenous Art]],&lt;ref name=para/&gt; and the [[Museo del Barro]] (Museum of Mud).

'''''River of Fundament''''' is a 2014 [[operatic]] [[experimental film]] written and directed by American artist and filmmaker [[Matthew Barney]], and co-directed by longtime collaborator Jonathan Bepler. It was produced by Barney and the [[Schaulager|Laurenz Foundation]] and is loosely based on the 1983 novel ''[[Ancient Evenings]]'' by [[Norman Mailer]]. The film features Barney, [[Dave Bald Eagle]], [[Milford Graves]], [[Ellen Burstyn]],  [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]], [[Paul Giamatti]], and [[Aimee Mullins]]. 

==Background== 
''River of Fundament'' was produced over 2007 to 2012, being the final product of a series of performances that accumulated into becoming the film's narrative. The film follows Norman Mailer (played by three different actors over the course of the film) as he travels through three different [[Reincarnation|reincarnations]], enduring the seven mythological states of his soul, loosely based on his own novel, "Ancient Evenings" (1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.riveroffundament.net/rof_synopsis.htm|title=Synopsis|last=Barney|first=Matthew|date=|website=River of Fundament|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the main narrative, it includes other elements from performance, sculpture, and opera. It has been described as an "eulogy for [Norman] Mailer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/09/matthew-barney-river-of-fundament-moca|title=This 6-Hour Film Will Test Your Patience, Thirst, and Expectations for Art|last=Benns|first=Sway|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film was released on February 12, 2014 in a limited theatrical release and through exhibitions at museums in several countries.

==Plot and narrative==
Writer [[Norman Mailer]], becoming a protagonist of his own, reincarnates three times during and after his wake into three separate bodies, the last failing to survive through the womb and body of his wife, Hathfertiti (a character in ''Ancient Evenings''). Each reincarnation, he wakes up in a river of feces running beneath his [[Brooklyn Heights]] apartment. 

Simultaneously, Mailer's body is represented as three generations of American cars: a [[Imperial (automobile)|1967 Chrysler Crown Imperial]] (referencing Barney's [[The Cremaster Cycle|Cremaster 3]]), a [[Pontiac Firebird|1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]] and finally a [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor|2001 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]]. All three cars are transmogrified through modern industrial processing and recycling to symbolize the regeneration and reincarnation of Mailer.

Through this, the narrative also follows American [[car dealership]]s, [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]], 'stomp teams', [[James Lee Byars]]' piece "The Death of James Lee Byars", [[Culture of Los Angeles|Los Angeles culture]], the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] and [[alchemy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18367">{{About|the Roman fortification system}}
[[File:Litus Saxonicum.png|thumb|right|300px|The fortifications and military commands of the Saxon Shore system extended on both sides of the [[English Channel|Channel]].]]
The '''Saxon Shore''' ({{lang-la|litus Saxonicum}}) was a military command of the late [[Roman Empire]], consisting of a series of fortifications on both sides of the [[English Channel]]. It was established in the late 3rd century and was led by the "[[Count of the Saxon Shore]]". In the late 4th century, his functions were limited to Britain, while the fortifications in Gaul were established as separate commands. Several Saxon Shore forts survive in east and south-east [[England]].

==Background==
During the latter half of the 3rd century, the [[Roman Empire]] faced a [[Crisis of the Third Century|grave crisis]]. Internally, it was weakened by civil wars, the violent succession of brief emperors, and secession in the provinces, while externally it faced a new wave of attacks by "barbarian" tribes. Most of Britain had been [[Roman Britain|part of the empire]] since the mid-1st century. It was protected from raids in the north by the [[Hadrian's Wall|Hadrianic]] and [[Antonine Wall]]s, while a [[Classis Britannica|fleet]] of some size was also available.

However, as the frontiers came under increasing external pressure, fortifications were built throughout the Empire in order to protect cities and guard strategically important locations. It is in this context that the forts of the Saxon Shore were constructed. Already in the 230s, under [[Severus Alexander]], several units had been withdrawn from the northern frontier and garrisoned at locations in the south, and had built new forts at Brancaster, Caister-on-Sea and [[Reculver]]. Dover was already fortified in the early 2nd century, and the other forts in this group were constructed in the period between the 270s and 290s.

==Meaning of the term and role==
[[File:Burgh Castle pre 1867.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A mid-19th century illustration of the ruins of [[Gariannonum]]]]
The only contemporary reference we possess that mentions the name "Saxon Shore" comes in the late 4th century ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', which lists its commander, the ''Comes Litoris Saxonici per Britanniam'' ("[[Count of the Saxon Shore]] in Britain"), and gives the names of the sites under his command and their respective complements of military personnel.&lt;ref name=NotitiaBritain&gt;Notitia Dignitatum, Pars Occ. XXVIII&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the absence of further evidence, theories have varied between scholars as to the exact meaning of the name, and also the nature and purpose of the chain of forts it refers to.

Two interpretations were put forward as to the meaning of the adjective "Saxon": either a shore ''attacked'' by [[Saxons]], or a shore ''settled'' by Saxons. Some argue that the latter hypothesis, which is less valid, is supported by [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], who states that during the 280s the sea along the coasts of Belgica and Armorica was "infested with Franks and Saxons", and that this was why [[Carausius]] was first put in charge of the fleet there.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Breviarium'', [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html#21 IX.21]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eutropius refers to Franks and Saxons as seaborne invaders. It also receives at least partial support from archaeological finds, as artefacts of a Germanic style have been found in burials, while there is evidence of the presence of Saxons (mostly laeti Roman army recruits though) in some numbers in SE England and the northern coasts of Gaul around [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] and [[Bayeux]] from the middle of the 5th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;''CBA Report 18: The Saxon Shore'', pp. 63-67&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, mirrors a well documented practice of deliberately settling Germanic tribes (Franks became foederati in 358 AD under Emperor Julian) to strengthen Roman defences.

The other interpretation, supported by Stephen Johnson, holds that the forts fulfilled a coastal defence role against seaborne invaders, mostly Saxons and Franks,&lt;ref&gt;[[Aurelius Victor]], ''De Caesaribus'' XXXIX.20-21&lt;/ref&gt; and acted as bases for the naval units operating against them. This view is reinforced by the parallel chain of fortifications across the [[English Channel|Channel]] on the northern coasts of [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], which complemented the British forts, suggesting a unified defensive system.&lt;ref name=Fields&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fields|first1=Nic|title=Rome's Saxon Shore - Coastal Defences of Roman Britain AD 250-500 (Fortress 56)|date=2006|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84603-094-9|pages=39–42|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars like John Cotterill however consider the threat posed by Germanic raiders, at least in the 3rd and early 4th centuries, to be exaggerated. They interpret the construction of the forts at Brancaster, Caister-on-Sea and Reculver in the early 3rd century and their location at the estuaries of navigable rivers as pointing to a different role: fortified points for transport and supply between Britain and Gaul, without any relation (at least at that time) to countering seaborne piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2006|pages= 43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is supported{{vague|date=March 2013}} by contemporary references to the supplying of the army of [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] by Caesar with grain from Britain during his campaign in Gaul in 359,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Historia Romana'', [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ammianus_18_book18.htm#C2 XVIII.2.3]; [[Zosimus]], ''Historia Nova'', [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/zosimus03_book3.htm III.5.2]&lt;/ref&gt; and their use as secure landing places by [[Count Theodosius]] during the suppression of the [[Great Conspiracy]] a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Historia Romana'', [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ammianus_27_book27.htm#C8 XXVII.8.6-7]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory, proposed by D.A. White, was that the extended system of large stone forts was disproportionate to any threat by seaborne Germanic raiders, and that it was actually conceived and constructed during the secession of [[Carausius]] and [[Allectus]] (the [[Carausian Revolt]]) in 289-296, and with an entirely different enemy in mind: they were to guard against an attempt at reconquest by the Empire. This view, although widely disputed, has found recent support from archaeological evidence at Pevensey, which dates the fort's construction to the early 290s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2006|pages=  42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever their original purpose, it is virtually certain that in the late 4th century the forts and their garrisons were employed in operations against Frankish and Saxon pirates. Britain was abandoned by Rome in 407, with [[Armorica]] following soon after. The forts on both sides continued to be inhabited in the following centuries, and in Britain in particular several continued in use well into the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] period.

==The forts==

===In Britain===
[[File:Notitia Dignitatum - Comes litoris Saxonici per Britanniam.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The nine British Saxon Shore forts in the ''Notitia Dignitatum''.]]
The nine forts mentioned in the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' for Britain are listed here, from north to south, with their garrisons.&lt;ref name=NotitiaBritain/&gt;
*''[[Branodunum]]'' ([[Brancaster]], [[Norfolk]]). One of the earliest forts, dated to the 230s. It was built to guard the [[The Wash|Wash]] approaches and is of a typical rectangular ''[[castrum]]'' layout.&lt;ref&gt;''CBA Report 18: The Saxon Shore'', pp.3-5&lt;/ref&gt; It was garrisoned by the ''[[Equites Dalmatae]] Brandodunenses'', although evidence exists suggesting that its original garrison was the ''cohors I Aquitanorum''.&lt;ref&gt;''CBA Report 18: The Saxon Shore'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Gariannonum]]'' ([[Burgh Castle Roman Site|Burgh Castle]], [[Norfolk]]). Established between 260 and the mid-270s to guard the [[River Yare]] (''Gariannus Fluvius''), it was garrisoned by the ''[[Equites Stablesiani]] Gariannoneses''. Although there is some discussion as to whether this is actually the fort at [[Caister Roman Site|Caister-on-Sea]], and being on the opposite bank of the same estuary as Burgh Castle.
*''[[Othona]]'' ([[Bradwell-on-Sea]], [[Essex]]). Garrisoned by the ''[[Numerus (Roman military unit)|Numerus]] Fortensium''.
*''[[Regulbium]]'' ([[Reculver]], [[Kent]]). Together with Brancaster one of the earliest forts, built in the 210s to guard the [[Thames]] estuary, it is likewise a ''castrum''.&lt;ref&gt;Attested by the only inscription found (see [http://www.roman-britain.org/places/regulbium.htm#nd ''Regulbium'' at RomanBritain.org])&lt;/ref&gt; It was garrisoned by the ''cohors I Baetasiorum'' since the 3rd century.
*''[[Rutupiae]]'' ([[Richborough]], [[Kent]]), garrisoned by parts of the ''[[Legio II Augusta]]''.
*''[[Dubris]]'' ([[Dover Castle]], [[Kent]]), garrisoned by the ''[[Milites]] Tungrecani''.
*''[[Portus Lemanis]]'' ([[Lympne]], [[Kent]]), garrisoned by the ''Numerus Turnacensium''.
*''[[Anderitum]]'' ([[Pevensey Castle]], [[East Sussex]]), garrisoned by the ''[[Abulci|Numerus Abulcorum]]''.
*''[[Portus Adurni]]'' ([[Portchester Castle]], [[Hampshire]]), garrisoned by a ''Numerus Exploratorum''.

There are a few other sites that clearly belonged to the system of the British branch of the Saxon Shore (the so-called "[[The Wash|Wash]]-[[Solent]] ''[[limes]]''"), although they are not included in the ''Notitia'', such as the forts at [[Walton Castle, Suffolk]], which has by now sunk into the sea due to erosion, and at [[Caister Roman Site|Caister-on-Sea]]. In the south, [[Carisbrooke Castle]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] and ''[[Clausentum]]'' ([[Bitterne]], in modern [[Southampton]]) are also regarded as westward extensions of the fortification chain. Other sites likely connected to the Saxon Shore system are the sunken fort at [[Skegness]], and the remains of possible signal stations at [[Thornham, Norfolk|Thornham]], [[Corton, Suffolk|Corton]] and [[Hadleigh, Suffolk|Hadleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;D. White (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

Further north on the coast, the precautions took the form of central depots at ''Lindum'' ([[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]]) and [[Malton, North Yorkshire|Malton]] with roads radiating to coastal signal stations. When an alert was relayed to the base, troops could be dispatched along the road. Further up the coast in North Yorkshire, a series of coastal watchtowers (at [[Saltburn-by-the-Sea|Huntcliff]], [[Filey]], [[Ravenscar, North Yorkshire|Ravenscar]], [[Goldsborough, Scarborough|Goldsborough]], and [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]) was constructed, linking the southern defences to the northern military zone of the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Frontier Studies'', pp. 124-147&lt;/ref&gt; Similar coastal fortifications are also found in [[Wales]], at [[Cardiff]] and [[Caer Gybi (fort)|Caer Gybi]]. The only fort in this style in the northern military zone is [[Lancaster, Lancashire]], built sometime in the mid-late 3rd century replacing an earlier fort and extramural community, which may reflect the extent of coastal protection on the north-west coast from invading tribes from Ireland.

===In Gaul===
The ''Notitia'' also includes two separate commands for the northern coast of Gaul, both of which belonged to the Saxon Shore system. However, when the list was compiled, in {{circa|420 AD|i=yes}}, Britain had been abandoned by Roman forces. The first command controlled the shores of the province [[Gallia Belgica|Belgica Secunda]] (roughly between the estuaries of the [[Scheldt]] and the [[Somme (river)|Somme]]), under the ''dux Belgicae Secundae'' with headquarters at Portus Aepatiaci:&lt;ref name=NotitiaBelgica&gt;Notitia Dignitatum, Pars Occ. XXXVIII&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Marcae'' (unidentified location near [[Calais]], possibly [[Marquise, Pas-de-Calais|Marquise]] or [[Marck, Pas-de-Calais|Marck]]), garrisoned by the ''Equites Dalmatae''. In the ''Notitia'', together with ''Grannona'', it is the only site on the Gallic shore to be explicitly referred to as lying ''in litore Saxonico''.
*''Locus Quartensis sive Hornensis'' (probably at the mouth of the [[Somme (river)|Somme]]), the port of the ''classis Sambrica'' ("Fleet of the Somme")
*''Portus Aepatiaci'' (possibly [[Étaples]]), garrisoned by the ''milites [[Nervii]]''.
Although not mentioned in the ''Notitia'', the port of ''Gesoriacum'' or ''Bononia'' ([[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]), which until 296 was the main base of the ''Classis Britannica'', would also have come under the ''dux Belgicae Secundae''.

To this group also belongs the Roman fort at [[Oudenburg]].

Further west, under the ''dux tractus Armoricani et Nervicani'', were mainly the coasts of [[Armorica]], nowadays [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]]. The ''Notitia'' lists the following sites:&lt;ref name=NotitiaArmorica&gt;Notitia Dignitatum, Pars Occ. XXXVII&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Grannona'' (disputed location, either at the mouths of the [[Seine]] or at [[Port-en-Bessin]]&lt;ref&gt;''CBA Report 18: The Saxon Shore'', p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;), the seat of the ''dux'', garrisoned by the ''cohors prima nova Armoricana''. In the ''Notitia'', it is explicitly mentioned as lying ''in litore Saxonico''.
*''Rotomagus'' ([[Rouen]]), garrisoned by the ''milites Ursariensii''
*''Constantia'' ([[Coutances]]), garrisoned by the ''[[Roman legion|legio]] I Flavia Gallicana Constantia''
*''Abricantis'' ([[Avranches]]), garrisoned by the ''milites Dalmati''
*''Grannona'' (uncertain whether this is a different location than the first ''Grannona'', perhaps [[Granville, Manche|Granville]]), garrisoned by the ''milites Grannonensii''
*''Aleto'' or ''Aletum'' (Aleth, near [[Saint-Malo]]), garrisoned by the ''milites Martensii''
*''Osismis'' ([[Brest, France|Brest]]), garrisoned by the ''milites Mauri Osismiaci''
*''Blabia'' (perhaps [[Hennebont]]), garrisoned by the ''milites Carronensii''
*''Benetis'' (possibly [[Vannes]]), garrisoned by the ''milites Mauri Beneti''
*''Manatias'' ([[Nantes]]), garrisoned by the ''milites superventores''

In addition, there are several other sites where a Roman military presence has been suggested. At [[Alderney]], the fort known as "The Nunnery" is known to date to Roman times,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-guernsey-15888516 Alderney ruin found to be Roman fort], BBC News, 25 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the settlement at Longy Common has been cited as evidence of a Roman military establishment, though the archaeological evidence there is, at best, scant.&lt;ref&gt;''CBA Report 18: The Saxon Shore'', pp. 31-34&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük''' (also '''Çatal Höyük''') is a baked-clay, nude female form, seated between feline-headed arm-rests. It is generally thought&lt;ref&gt;A typical assessment: "A terracotta statuette of a seated (mother) goddess giving birth with each hand on the head of a leopard or panther from Çatalhöyük (dated around 6000 B.C.E.)" (Sarolta A. Takács, "Cybele and Catullus' ''Attis''", in Eugene N. Lane, ''Cybele, Attis and related cults: essays in memory of M.J. Vermaseren'' 1996:376.&lt;/ref&gt; to depict a corpulent and fertile [[Mother Goddess]]&lt;ref&gt;So rendered in popularized accounts, such as ''The Oxford Companion to World Mythology'', 2005: ''s.v.'' "Hittite-Hurrian mythology": "...the goddess of Çatalhöyük,&lt;!--Hüyük in original--&gt; her Anatolian descendants were the great [[Phrygia]]n goddess Cybele, the mother of the sacrificed [[Attis]], and the many-breasted [[Temple of Artemis|Artemis of Ephesus]]."&lt;/ref&gt; in the process of giving birth while seated on her throne, which has two hand rests in the form of  feline (leopard or panther) heads. The statuette, one of several [[iconography|iconographically]] similar ones found at the site, is associated to other corpulent prehistoric goddess figures,&lt;ref&gt;Noted in Honour and Fleming 2005 "Ch.1: Before History"&lt;/ref&gt; of which the most famous is the [[Venus of Willendorf]].

It is a [[neolithic]] sculpture shaped by an unknown artist, and was completed sometime about 6000 BC. It was unearthed by [[archaeologist]] [[James Mellaart]] in 1961 at [[Çatalhöyük]], [[Turkey]]. When it was found, its head and hand rest of the right side were missing. The current head and the hand rest are modern replacements. The sculpture is at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]] in [[Ankara]], Turkey.

The ''[[Diné Bahaneʼ#Spider Man, Spider Woman and Weaving|Diné Bahaneʼ]]'' creation narrative of the Navajo (recorded 1928) includes a mention of "Spider Man and Spider Woman", who introduced the [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] and the [[loom]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Bryan, Aileen, ''The Diné: Origin Myths of the Navajo Indians'' (Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, "The Age of Beginning", transcribed 1928).

In [[Pueblo Indians|Pueblo]] tradition, Spider Old Woman appears as the equivalent of "[[Tsichtinako|Thought Woman]]" ([[Keresan languages|Keresan]] ''Tse-che-nako, Sussistanako''): while the name of "Thought Woman" was reserved for sacred ceremonies, Spider Woman would be used in the context of everyday discussion or teaching.&lt;ref&gt;"Some confusion is sometimes created concerning Tse che nako and Old Spider Woman, especially in secular discussions. [[Keres people|Kere]] holy men hesitate to mention Tse che nako's name, especially for purely secular discussions; Thought Woman's name is reserved for use only in sacred ceremonies. In secular discussions and teachings, Tse che nako is often symbolically referred to as Old Spider Woman or Spider Woman. "Purley, Anthony F. (1974).

[[Karl Taube]] in 1983 tentatively connected the South Western "Spider Woman" mytheme with the pre-Columbian [[Teotihuacan]] "[[Great Goddess of Teotihuacan|Great Goddess]]" known from pictorial representations.

Online]] to [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]].&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; It heavily samples [[culture of Japan|Japanese popular culture]].&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The website serves primarily as an artistic work that was produced using the tools and methods of [[web design]]. This genre of [[art]] is often referred to as [[web art]].

The site consists of a veritable maze of inter-linked visual, conceptual "subprojects" ranging from two-tone and technical-looking to wacky, colorful, and even bizarre. Often a subproject will have clickable elements linked to other pages within that subproject, or to another, or that just provide visual richness (for example, [http://www.superbad.com/1/follow the "follow" subproject] has a grid of circles with arrows that follow the mouse cursor; each circle is a link to a different page within the site). Some of the pages contain narrative elements. There are 143 different pages. His main page serves as a hub to all his subprojects. Clicking anywhere on the "bad" will link to somewhere within each subproject. There are no links back to the main page, once in the maze, there appears to be no way out.

''TIME'' magazine cited "the very randomness of the electronic images" offered on the website that lures the viewer "deeper and deeper into its playful maze".&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt;

Benjamin sells nothing on Superbad, and received little extra traffic from the Webby award.&lt;ref name="Kopytoff"/&gt; Up to 10 percent of the 2000 Biennale consisted of various [[net art]] projects, marking the first time they were considered "so prominently among the traditional arts", according to Salon.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Benjamin "didn't really start thinking of Superbad as art until the art people started finding it", but insisted that the Whitney's selection of his and other web art projects "makes it look more valid to the art crowd.  So all of a sudden because it's in a museum it's not crap anymore?"&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

A '''taste receptor''' is a type of [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] which facilitates the sensation of [[taste]]. These receptors are of four types. When food or other substances enter the mouth, molecules interact with saliva and are bound to taste receptors in the oral cavity and other locations. Molecules which give a sensation of taste are considered "sapid".&lt;ref name="oven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-14706-4/the-science-of-the-oven/excerpt|title=The Science of the Oven - Excerpt from Chapter 1|last=This|first=Hervé|date=2012|accessdate=30 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taste receptors are divided into two families:{{cn | reason = There are five basic tastes; only 3 are represented with these two families.  It would be more credible if a good reference says there are only these two. |date=April 2018}}
* Type 1, [[Sweetness|sweet]], first characterized in 2001:&lt;ref name="pmid11509186"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nelson G, Hoon MA, Chandrashekar J, Zhang Y, Ryba NJ, Zuker CS | title = Mammalian sweet taste receptors | journal = Cell | volume = 106 | issue = 3 | pages = 381–90 | date = Aug 2001 | pmid = 11509186 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00451-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Gene|TAS1R2}} – {{Gene|TAS1R3}}
* Type 2, [[bitter (taste)|bitter]], first characterized in 2000:&lt;ref name="pmid10761934"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adler E, Hoon MA, Mueller KL, Chandrashekar J, Ryba NJ, Zuker CS | title = A novel family of mammalian taste receptors | journal = Cell | volume = 100 | issue = 6 | pages = 693–702 | date = Mar 2000 | pmid = 10761934 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80705-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Gene|TAS2R1}} – {{Gene|TAS2R50}}, and {{Gene|TAS2R60}}

Combinations of these receptors in dimers or other complexes contributes to different perceptions of taste.

Visual, olfactive, “sapictive” (the perception of tastes), trigeminal (hot, cool), mechanical, all contribute to the perception of ''taste''. Of these, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 ([[TRPV1]]) vanilloid receptors are responsible for the perception of heat from some molecules such as capsaicin, and a [[TRPM8|CMR1 receptor]] is responsible for the perception of cold from molecules such as menthol, eucalyptol, and icilin.&lt;ref name="oven"/&gt;

== Tissue distribution ==

The [[gustatory system]] consists of taste receptor cells in [[taste bud]]s. Taste buds, in turn, are contained in structures called [[lingual papillae|papillae]]. There are three types of papillae involved in taste: [[fungiform papilla]]e, [[foliate papilla]]e, and [[circumvallate papilla]]e. (The fourth type - [[lingual papilla#filiform papillae|filiform papillae]] do not contain taste buds). Beyond the papillae, taste receptors are also in the [[palate]] and early parts of the [[digestive system]] like the [[larynx]] and upper [[esophagus]].  There are three [[cranial nerve]]s that innervate the tongue; the [[vagus nerve]], [[glossopharyngeal nerve]], and the [[facial nerve]].  The [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] and the [[chorda tympani]] branch of the [[facial nerve]] innervate the TAS1R and TAS2R taste receptors.

In 2010, researchers found bitter receptors in lung tissue, which cause airways to relax when a bitter substance is encountered.  They believe this mechanism is evolutionarily adaptive because it helps clear lung infections, but could also be exploited to treat [[asthma]] and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deshpande DA, Wang WC, McIlmoyle EL, Robinett KS, Schillinger RM, An SS, Sham JS, Liggett SB | title = Bitter taste receptors on airway smooth muscle bronchodilate by localized calcium signaling and reverse obstruction | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 11 | pages = 1299–304 | date = Nov 2010 | pmid = 20972434 | pmc = 3066567 | doi = 10.1038/nm.2237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

[[Taste]] helps to identify [[toxin]]s and maintain [[nutrition]].  Five basic tastes are recognized today: salty, sweet, bitter, sour, and [[umami]].  Salty and sour taste sensations are both detected through [[ion channel]]s.  Sweet, bitter, and umami tastes, however, are detected by way of [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein-coupled]] taste receptors.&lt;ref name="pmid17444812"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bachmanov AA, Beauchamp GK | title = Taste receptor genes | journal = Annual Review of Nutrition | volume = 27 | issue =  | pages = 389–414 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17444812 | pmc = 2721271 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.nutr.26.061505.111329 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some agents can function as [[:Category:Taste modifiers|taste modifiers]], as [[miraculin]] or [[curculin]] for sweet or [[sterubin]] to [[:Category:Bitter-masking compounds|mask bitter]].

== Mechanism of action ==

The standard bitter, sweet, or umami taste receptor is a [[G protein-coupled receptor]] with seven transmembrane domains.

=== Sweet ===

The [[TAS1R2]]+[[TAS1R3]] heterodimer receptor functions as the [[sweet]] receptor by binding to a wide variety of [[sugar]]s and [[sugar substitute]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid11509186"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Li"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li X, Staszewski L, Xu H, Durick K, Zoller M, Adler E | title = Human receptors for sweet and umami taste | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 7 | pages = 4692–6 | date = Apr 2002 | pmid = 11917125 | pmc = 123709 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.072090199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  TAS1R2+3 expressing cells are found in [[circumvallate papilla]]e and [[foliate papilla]]e near the back of the [[tongue]] and [[palate]] taste receptor cells in the roof of the mouth.&lt;ref name="pmid11509186"/&gt;  These cells are shown to [[synapse]] upon the [[chorda tympani]] and [[glossopharyngeal nerve]]s to send their signals to the brain.&lt;ref name="pmid17444812"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danilova"/&gt; The [[TAS1R3]] homodimer also functions as a sweet receptor in much the same way as TAS1R2+3 but has decreased sensitivity to sweet substances.  Natural sugars are more easily detected by the [[TAS1R3]] receptor than [[sugar substitute]]s.  This may help explain why sugar and artificial sweeteners have different tastes.&lt;ref name="Zhao"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao GQ, Zhang Y, Hoon MA, Chandrashekar J, Erlenbach I, Ryba NJ, Zuker CS | title = The receptors for mammalian sweet and umami taste | journal = Cell | volume = 115 | issue = 3 | pages = 255–66 | date = Oct 2003 | pmid = 14636554 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00844-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bitter===
The TAS2R proteins function as [[bitter (taste)|bitter]] taste receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandrashekar J, Mueller KL, Hoon MA, Adler E, Feng L, Guo W, Zuker CS, Ryba NJ | title = T2Rs function as bitter taste receptors | journal = Cell | volume = 100 | issue = 6 | pages = 703–11 | date = Mar 2000 | pmid = 10761935 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80706-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are 43 human ''TAS2R'' genes, each of which (excluding the five [[pseudogene]]s) lacks [[intron]]s and codes for a [[GPCR]] protein.&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;  These proteins, as opposed to TAS1R proteins, have short extracellular domains and are located in [[circumvallate papillae]], [[palate]], [[foliate papillae]], and [[epiglottis]] taste buds, with reduced expression in [[fungiform papillae]].&lt;ref name="pmid10761934"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt; Though it is certain that multiple TAS2Rs are expressed in one taste receptor cell, it is still debated whether mammals can distinguish between the tastes of different bitter [[ligand]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid10761934"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;  Some overlap must occur, however, as there are far more bitter compounds than there are TAS2R genes.  Common bitter ligands include [[cycloheximide]], [[denatonium]], PROP (6-''n''-propyl-2-[[thiouracil]]), PTC ([[phenylthiocarbamide]]), and β-[[glucoside|glucopyranosides]].&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;

[[Signal transduction]] of bitter stimuli is accomplished via the α-subunit of [[gustducin]].  This G protein subunit activates a taste [[phosphodiesterase]] and decreases [[cyclic nucleotide]] levels.  Further steps in the transduction pathway are still unknown.  The βγ-subunit of gustducin also mediates taste by activating IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[inositol triphosphate]]) and DAG ([[diglyceride]]).  These second messengers may open gated ion channels or may cause release of internal [[calcium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Margolskee RF | title = Molecular mechanisms of bitter and sweet taste transduction | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 277 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | date = Jan 2002 | pmid = 11696554 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1074/jbc.R100054200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though all TAS2Rs are located in gustducin-containing cells, knockout of gustducin does not completely abolish sensitivity to bitter compounds, suggesting a redundant mechanism for bitter tasting&lt;ref name = "pmid12581520"/&gt; (unsurprising given that a bitter taste generally signals the presence of a [[toxin]]).&lt;ref name = "pmid12581520"/&gt;  One proposed mechanism for gustducin-independent bitter tasting is via ion channel interaction by specific bitter ligands, similar to the ion channel interaction which occurs in the tasting of sour and salty stimuli.&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;

One of the best-researched TAS2R proteins is [[TAS2R38]], which contributes to the tasting of both PROP and PTC.  It is also the only taste receptor whose [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s are shown to be responsible for differences in taste perception.  Current studies are focused on determining other such taste phenotype-determining polymorphisms.&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;

[[File:Signal Transaction of Taste; Bitter.svg|thumb|The diagram depicted above shows the signal transduction pathway of the bitter taste. Bitter taste has many different receptors and signal transduction pathways. Bitter indicates poison to animals. It is most similar to sweet.

A bitter substance such as quinine, is consumed and binds to G Protein-coupled receptors.II. Part II is the transduction pathway 2. Gustducin, a G protein second messenger, is activated. 3. Phosphodiesterase, an enzyme, is then activated. 4. Cyclic nucleotide, cNMP, is used, lowering the concentration 5. Channels such as the K+, potassium, channels, close.III. Part III is the response of the taste cell. 6. This leads to increased levels of Ca+. 7. The neurotransmitters are activated. 8. The signal is sent to the neuron.]]

=== Sour ===

Historically it was thought that the sour taste was produced solely when free [[Hydronium|hydrogen ions]] (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) directly depolarised taste receptors. However, specific receptors for sour taste with other methods of action are now being proposed.  HCN1 and HCN4 ([[HCN channel]]s) were two such proposals; both of these receptors are cyclic nucleotide-gated channels.  The two ion channels suggested to contribute to sour taste are [[ACCN1]] and TASK-1.

[[File:Signal Transaction of Taste; Sour &amp; Salty.svg|thumb|The diagram depicts the signal transduction pathway of the sour or salty taste. Object A is a taste bud, object B is a taste receptor cell within object A, and object C is the neuron attached to object B. I. Part I is the reception of hydrogen ions or sodium ions. 1. If the taste is sour, H+ ions, from an acidic substances, pass through their specific ion channel. Some can go through the Na+ channels. If the taste is salty Na+, sodium, molecules pass through the Na+ channels. Depolarization takes place II. Part II is the transduction pathway of the relay molecules.2. Cation, such as K+, channels are opened. III. Part III is the response of the cell. 3. An influx of Ca+ ions is activated.4. The Ca+ activates neurotransmitters. 5. A signal is sent to the neuron attached to the taste bud.]]

=== Salt ===

Various receptors have also been proposed for salty tastes, along with the possible taste detection of lipids, complex carbohydrates, and water.  Evidence for these receptors is, however, shaky at best, and is often unconvincing in mammal studies.  For example, the proposed [[ENaC]] receptor for sodium detection can only be shown to contribute to sodium taste in ''Drosophilia''.&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;

=== Carbonation ===

An enzyme connected to the sour receptor transmits information about carbonated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nih.gov/news/health/oct2009/nidcr-15.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703113412/http://www.nih.gov/news/health/oct2009/nidcr-15.htm |archivedate=2015-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fat===
A possible taste receptor for fat, [[CD36]], has been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laugerette F, Passilly-Degrace P, Patris B, Niot I, Febbraio M, Montmayeur JP, Besnard P | title = CD36 involvement in orosensory detection of dietary lipids, spontaneous fat preference, and digestive secretions | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 115 | issue = 11 | pages = 3177–84 | date = Nov 2005 | pmid = 16276419 | doi = 10.1172/JCI25299 | pmc=1265871}}&lt;/ref&gt; CD36 has been localized to the circumvallate and foliate [[lingual papillae|papillae]], which are present in [[taste bud]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simons PJ, Kummer JA, Luiken JJ, Boon L | title = Apical CD36 immunolocalization in human and porcine taste buds from circumvallate and foliate papillae | journal = Acta Histochemica | volume = 113 | issue = 8 | pages = 839–43 | date = Dec 2011 | pmid = 20950842 | doi = 10.1016/j.acthis.2010.08.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and research has shown that the CD36 receptor binds long chain [[fatty acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baillie AG, Coburn CT, Abumrad NA | title = Reversible binding of long-chain fatty acids to purified FAT, the adipose CD36 homolog | journal = The Journal of Membrane Biology | volume = 153 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–81 | date = Sep 1996 | pmid = 8694909 | doi=10.1007/s002329900111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in the amount of CD36 [[gene expression|expression]] in human subjects was associated with their ability to taste fats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pepino MY, Love-Gregory L, Klein S, Abumrad NA | title = The fatty acid translocase gene CD36 and lingual lipase influence oral sensitivity to fat in obese subjects | journal = Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | pages = 561–6 | date = Mar 2012 | pmid = 22210925 | doi = 10.1194/jlr.M021873 | pmc=3276480}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a case for the receptor's relationship to fat tasting. Further research into the CD36 receptor could be useful in determining the existence of a true fat-tasting receptor.

[[GPR120]] and [[Free fatty acid receptor 1|GPR40]] have been implicated to respond to oral fat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = DiPatrizio NV | title = Is fat taste ready for primetime? | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 136 | pages = 145–54 | date = Sep 2014 | pmid = 24631296 | doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.03.002 | pmc=4162865}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their absence leads to reduced fat preference and reduced neuronal response to orally administered fatty acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cartoni C, Yasumatsu K, Ohkuri T, Shigemura N, Yoshida R, Godinot N, le Coutre J, Ninomiya Y, Damak S | title = Taste preference for fatty acids is mediated by GPR40 and GPR120 | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 30 | issue = 25 | pages = 8376–82 | date = Jun 2010 | pmid = 20573884 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0496-10.2010 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/30/25/8376.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TRPM5]] has been shown to be involved in oral fat response and identified as a possible oral fat receptor, but recent evidence presents it as primarily a downstream actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mattes RD | title = Accumulating evidence supports a taste component for free fatty acids in humans | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 104 | issue = 4 | pages = 624–31 | date = Sep 2011 | pmid = 21557960 | doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.05.002 | pmc=3139746}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu P, Shah BP, Croasdell S, Gilbertson TA | title = Transient receptor potential channel type M5 is essential for fat taste | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 31 | issue = 23 | pages = 8634–42 | date = Jun 2011 | pmid = 21653867 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6273-10.2011 | pmc=3125678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

Human bitter taste receptor genes are named TAS2R1 to TAS2R64, with many gaps due to non-existent genes, pseudogenes or proposed genes that have not been annotated to the most recent human genome assembly. Many bitter taste receptor genes also have confusing synonym names with several different gene names referring to the same gene. See table below for full list of human bitter taste receptor genes:

'''''The Cat in the Hat''''' is a [[children's book]] written and illustrated by Theodor Geisel under the pen name [[Dr. Seuss]] and first published in 1957. The story centers on a tall [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] cat, who wears a red and white-striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat shows up at the house of Sally and her brother one rainy day when their mother is away. Despite the repeated objections of the children's fish, the Cat shows the children a few of his tricks in an attempt to entertain them. In the process he and his companions, Thing One and Thing Two, wreck the house. The children and the fish become more and more alarmed until the Cat produces a machine that he uses to clean everything up and disappears just before the children's mother comes home.

Geisel created the book in response to a debate in the United States about literacy in [[early childhood]] and the ineffectiveness of traditional [[Primer (textbook)|primers]] such as those featuring [[Dick and Jane]]. Geisel was asked to write a more entertaining primer by William Spaulding, whom he had met during World War II and who was then director of the education division at [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]]. However, because Geisel was already under contract with [[Random House]], the two publishers agreed to a deal: Houghton Mifflin published the education edition, which was sold to schools, and Random House published the trade edition, which was sold in bookstores.

Geisel gave varying accounts of how he created ''The Cat in the Hat'', but in the version he told most often he was so frustrated with the word list from which he could choose words to write his story that he decided to scan the list and create a story based on the first two words he found that rhymed. The words he found were ''cat'' and ''hat''. The book was met with immediate critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised it as an exciting alternative to traditional primers. Three years after its debut, the book had already sold over a million copies, and in 2001 ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' listed the book at number nine on its list of best-selling children's books of all time. The book's success led to the creation of [[Beginner Books]], a publishing house centered on producing similar books for young children learning to read. In 1983, Geisel said, "It is the book I'm proudest of because it had something to do with the death of the Dick and Jane primers." The book was adapted into [[The Cat in the Hat (TV special)|a 1971 animated television special]] and  [[The Cat in the Hat (film)|a 2003 live-action film]].

== Plot ==

The story begins as a girl named Sally and her brother, who serves as the narrator of the book, sit alone in their house on a cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly followed by the arrival of the Cat in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat should leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes increasingly trickier, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the Cat in the Hat just proposes another game.

The Cat brings in a big red box from outside, from which he releases two identical creatures with blue hair and red suits called Thing One and Thing Two. The Things cause more trouble, such as flying kites in the house, knocking pictures off the wall and picking up the children's mother's new polka-dotted gown. All this comes to an end when the fish spots the children's mother out the window. In response, Sally's brother catches the Things in a net, and the Cat, apparently ashamed, stores them back in the big red box. He takes it out the front door as the fish and the children survey the mess he has made. But the Cat soon returns, riding a machine that picks everything up and cleans the house, delighting the fish and the children. The Cat then leaves just before their mother arrives, and the fish and the children are back where they started at the beginning of the story. As she steps in, the mother asks the children what they did while she was out, but the children are hesitant and do not answer. The story ends with the question, "What would ''you'' do if your mother asked ''you''?"

== Background ==
[[File:Johnhersey.jpg|right|thumb|An article by [[John Hersey]] about literacy in early childhood provided inspiration for ''The Cat in the Hat''.]]
Theodor Geisel, writing as Dr. Seuss, created ''The Cat in the Hat'' partly in response to the May 24, 1954, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine article by [[John Hersey]] titled "Why Do Students Bog Down on First R? A Local Committee Sheds Light on a National Problem: Reading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Brien|first=Anne|title=An Educational Innovation: The Cat in the Hat|url=http://www.learningfirst.org/educational-innovation-cat-hat|publisher=Learning First Alliance|accessdate=8 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102012917/http://www.learningfirst.org/educational-innovation-cat-hat|archive-date=2 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nel 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;29&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, Hersey was critical of school [[Primer (textbook)|primers]] like those featuring [[Dick and Jane]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the classroom boys and girls are confronted with books that have insipid illustrations depicting the slicked-up lives of other children... All feature abnormally courteous, unnaturally clean boys and girls.... In bookstores anyone can buy brighter, livelier books featuring strange and wonderful animals and children who behave naturally, i.e., sometimes misbehave... Given incentive from school boards, publishers could do as well with primers.&lt;ref&gt;Hersey 1954, pp. 136-137&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

After detailing many issues contributing to the dilemma connected with student reading levels, Hersey asked toward the end of the article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why should [school primers] not have pictures that widen rather than narrow the associative richness the children give to the words they illustrate—drawings like those of the wonderfully imaginative geniuses among children's illustrators, [[John Tenniel|Tenniel]], [[Howard Pyle]], "Dr. Seuss", [[Walt Disney]]?&lt;ref&gt;Hersey 1954, p.&amp;nbsp;148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This article caught the attention of William Spaulding, who had met Geisel during the war and who was then the director of Houghton Mifflin's education division.&lt;ref name="Morgan1"&gt;Morgan 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;153-154&lt;/ref&gt; Spaulding had also read the best-selling 1955 book ''Why Johnny Can't Read'' by [[Rudolf Flesch]].&lt;ref&gt;Menander 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt; Flesch, like Hersey, criticized primers as boring but also criticized them for teaching reading through [[word recognition]] rather than [[phonics]].&lt;ref name="Menand 2"&gt;Menand 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Spaulding invited Geisel to dinner in Boston where he proposed that Geisel create a book "for six- and seven-year-olds who had already mastered the basic mechanics of reading".&lt;ref name="Morgan1"/&gt; He reportedly challenged, "Write me a story that first-graders can't put down!"&lt;ref name="Morgan1"/&gt;

At the back of ''Why Johnny Can't Read'', Flesch had included 72 lists of words that young children should be able to read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list.&lt;ref name="Menand 2"/&gt; Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him with a list of 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words.&lt;ref name="Morgan1"/&gt; However, according to [[Philip Nel]], Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969.&lt;ref name="Nel-background"/&gt; He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.&lt;ref name="Nel-background"&gt;Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;24-26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Geisel gave varying accounts of how he conceived of ''The Cat in the Hat''. According to the story Geisel told most often, he was so frustrated with the word list that William Spaulding had given him that he finally decided to scan the list and create a story out of the first two words he found that rhymed. The words he found were ''cat'' and ''hat''.&lt;ref name="Nel-background"/&gt; 
Near the end of his life, Geisel told his biographers, Judith and Neil Morgan, that he conceived the beginnings of the story while he was with Spaulding, in an elevator in the Houghton Mifflin offices in Boston.&lt;ref name= "Morgan 153"&gt;Morgan 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;153&lt;/ref&gt; It was an old, shuddering elevator and was operated by a "small, stooped woman wearing 'a leather half-glove and a secret smile'".&lt;ref name= "Morgan 153"/&gt; [[Anita Silvey]], recounting a similar story, described the woman as "a very elegant, very petite African-American woman named Annie Williams".&lt;ref name="silvey"&gt;{{cite episode |title=How the Cat Got His Smile |date=March 1, 2007 |url=https://www.npr.org/player/v2/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&amp;t=1&amp;islist=false&amp;id=7651308&amp;m=7651309 |network=NPR |last=Silvey |first=Anita|series=Listen Morning Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel told Silvey that, when he sketched the Cat in the Hat, he thought of Williams and gave the character Williams' white gloves and "sly, even foxy smile".&lt;ref name="silvey"/&gt;

[[File:Everest North Face toward Base Camp Tibet Luca Galuzzi 2006.jpg|thumb|left|According to Geisel, one of the stories he pitched before ''The Cat in the Hat'' involved scaling [[Mount Everest]].]]
Geisel gave two conflicting, partly fictionalized accounts of the book's creation in two articles, "How Orlo Got His Book" in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' and "My Hassle with the First Grade Language"  in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', both published on November 17, 1957.&lt;ref name="Nel-background"/&gt; In "My Hassle with the First Grade Language", he wrote about his proposal to a "distinguished schoolbook publisher" to write a book for young children about "scaling the peaks of Everest at 60 degrees below".&lt;ref name="Nel 171"/&gt; The publisher was intrigued but informed him that, because of the word list, "you can't use the word ''scaling''. You can't use the word ''peaks''. You can't use ''Everest''. You can't use ''60''. You can't use ''degrees''. You can't..."&lt;ref name="Nel 171"&gt;"My Hassle With the First Grade Language" 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;171&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel gave a similar account to Robert Cahn for an article in the July 6, 1957, edition of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.&lt;ref name="Nel-background"/&gt; In "My Hassle With the First Grade Language", he also told a story of the "three excruciatingly painful weeks" in which he worked on a story about a King Cat and a Queen Cat.&lt;ref&gt;"My Hassle With the First Grade Language" 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;173&lt;/ref&gt; However, "queen" was not on the word list, nor did his first grade nephew, Norval, recognize it. So Geisel returned to the work but could then think only of words that started with the letter "q", which did not appear in any word on the list. He then had a similar fascination with the letter "z", which also did not appear in any word on the list. When he did finally finish the book and showed it to his nephew, Norval had already graduated from the first grade and was learning calculus. Philip Nel notes, in his dissection of the article, that Norval was Geisel's invention. Geisel's niece, Peggy Owens, did have a son, but he was only a one-year-old when the article was published.&lt;ref&gt;"My Hassle With the First Grade Language" 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;170&lt;/ref&gt;

In "How Orlo Got His Book", he described Orlo, a fictional, archetypal young child who was turned off of reading by the poor selection of simple reading material.&lt;ref name="Nel 167"&gt;"How Orlo Got His Book" 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;167&lt;/ref&gt; To save Orlo the frustration, Geisel decided to write a book for children like Orlo but found the task "not dissimilar to... being lost with a witch in a tunnel of love".&lt;ref name="Nel 167"/&gt; He tried to write a story called "The Queen Zebra" but found that both words did not appear on the list. In fact, like Geisel wrote in "My Hassle with the First Grade Language", the letters "q" and "z" did not appear on the list at all. He then tried to write a story about a bird, without using the word ''bird'' as it did not appear on the list. He decided to call it a "wing thing" instead but struggled as he discovered that it "couldn't have ''legs'' or a ''beak'' or a ''tail''. Neither a ''left'' foot or a ''right'' foot."&lt;ref name="Nel 169"&gt;"How Orlo Got His Book" 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;169&lt;/ref&gt; On his approach to writing ''The Cat in the Hat'' he wrote, "The method I used is the same method you use when you sit down to make apple stroodle [sic] without stroodles."&lt;ref name="Nel 169"/&gt;

Geisel variously stated that the book took between nine and 18 months to create.&lt;ref&gt;Nel 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;30&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Pease notes that he worked on it primarily alone, unlike with previous books, which had been more collaborative efforts between Geisel and his wife, [[Helen Palmer Geisel|Helen]].&lt;ref&gt;Pease 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;112&amp;ndash;115&lt;/ref&gt; This marked a general trend in his work and life. As [[Robert L. Bernstein]] later said of that period, "The more I saw of him, the more he liked being in that room and creating all by himself."&lt;ref name="Pease 114"&gt;Pease 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;114&lt;/ref&gt; Pease points to Helen's recovery from [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]], which she was diagnosed with in 1954, as the marker for this change.&lt;ref name="Pease 114"/&gt;

== Publication history ==
[[File:Bennettcerf.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Bennett Cerf]], the head of [[Random House]], negotiated a deal that allowed both Random House and Houghton Mifflin to publish versions of ''The Cat in the Hat''.]]
Geisel agreed to write ''The Cat in the Hat'' at the request of William Spaulding of Houghton Mifflin; however, because Geisel was under contract with Random House, the head of Random House, [[Bennett Cerf]], made a deal with Houghton Mifflin. Random House retained the rights to trade sales, which encompassed copies of the book sold at book stores, while Houghton Mifflin retained the education rights, which encompassed copies sold to schools.&lt;ref name="Morgan1"/&gt;

The Houghton Mifflin edition was released in January or February 1957, and the Random House edition was released on March 1.&lt;ref name=Neary&gt;{{cite web|last=Neary|first=Lynn|title=Fifty Years of 'The Cat in the Hat'|url=https://www.npr.org/2007/03/01/7651308/fifty-years-of-the-cat-in-the-hat#7649624|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two editions featured different covers but were otherwise identical.&lt;ref name=Neary/&gt; The first edition can be identified by the "200/200" mark in the top right corner of the front dust jacket flap, signifying the $2.00 selling price. The price was reduced to $1.95 on later editions.&lt;ref&gt;Nel 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Judith and Neil Morgan, the book sold well immediately. The trade edition initially sold an average of 12,000 copies a month, a figure which rose rapidly.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; [[Bullock's]] department store in Los Angeles, California, sold out of its first, 100-copy order of the book in a day and quickly reordered 250 more.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; The Morgans attribute these sales numbers to "playground word-of-mouth", asserting that children heard about the book from their friends and nagged their parents to buy it for them.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; However, Houghton Mifflin's school edition did not sell as well. As Geisel noted in Jonathan Cott's 1983 profile of him, "Houghton Mifflin... had trouble selling it to the schools; there were a lot of Dick and Jane devotees, and my book was considered too fresh and irreverent. But Bennett Cerf at Random House had asked for trade rights, and it just took off in the bookstores."&lt;ref name= "Cott 115"&gt;Cott 1983, p.&amp;nbsp;115&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel told the Morgans, "Parents understood better than school people the necessity for this kind of reader."&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt;

After three years in print, ''The Cat in the Hat'' had sold nearly one million copies. By then, the book had been translated into French, Chinese, Swedish, and Braille.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; In 2001, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' placed it at number nine on its list of the best-selling children's books of all time.&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA186995.html|title=All-Time Bestselling Children's Books|date= 17 December 2001|work=Publishers Weekly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225125934/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA186995.html|archivedate=December 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, more than 10 million copies of ''The Cat in the Hat'' have been printed, and it has been translated into more than 12 different languages, including [[Latin]], under the title ''Cattus Petasatus''.&lt;ref name=horrigan&gt;{{cite web|last=Horrigan|first=Kevin|title=The Cat at 50: Still lots of good fun that is funny|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/29362154.html|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cattus petasatus: The cat in the hat in Latin|year=2000|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci|isbn=9780865164710|pages=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVVbAAAAMAAJ|author=Dr. Seuss |author2=Jennifer Morrish Tunberg |author3=[[Terence Tunberg]]|accessdate=29 November 2013|language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, on the occasion of the book's fiftieth anniversary, Random House released ''The Annotated Cat:  Under the Hats of Seuss and His Cats'', which includes both ''The Cat in the Hat'' and its sequel, with annotations and an introduction by Philip Nel.&lt;ref name=Neary/&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Ted Geisel NYWTS 2 crop.jpg|left|thumb|Geisel in 1957, holding a copy of ''The Cat in the Hat'']]
The book was published to immediate critical acclaim. Some reviewers praised the book as an exciting way to learn to read, particularly compared to the primers that it supplanted. Ellen Lewis Buell, in her review for ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', noted the book's heavy use of one-syllable words and lively illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buell|first=Ellen Lewis|title=High Jinks at Home|newspaper=[[The New York Times Book Review]]|date=17 March 1957 |postscript=, as quoted in Fensch 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;124–125.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote, "Beginning readers and parents who have been helping them through the dreary activities of Dick and Jane and other primer characters are due for a happy surprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buell|first=Ellen Lewis|title=High Jinks at Home|newspaper=[[The New York Times Book Review]]|date=17 March 1957 |postscript=, as quoted in Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helen Adams Masten of the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' called the book Geisel's ''tour de force'' and wrote, "Parents and teachers will bless Mr. Geisel for this amusing reader with its ridiculous and lively drawings, for their children are going to have the exciting experience of learning that they ''can'' read after all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Masten|first=Helen Adams|title=The Cat in the Hat|newspaper=[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]|date=11 May 1957 |postscript=, as quoted in Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polly Goodwin of the ''[[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Sunday Tribune]]'' predicted that ''The Cat in the Hat'' would cause seven- and eight-year-olds to "look with distinct distaste on the drab adventures of standard primer characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodwin|first=Polly|title=Hurray for Dr. Seuss!|newspaper=Chicago Sunday Tribune|date=12 May 1957|location=Chicago IL |postscript=, as quoted in Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Helen E. Walker of ''[[Library Journal]]'' and Emily Maxwell of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' felt that the book would appeal to older children as well as to its target audience of first- and second-graders.&lt;ref name="Nel-reviews"&gt;Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer for ''The Bookmark'' concurred, writing, "Recommended enthusiastically as a picture book as well as a reader".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Some Early Spring Books for Children and Young People|newspaper=The Bookmark|date=April 1957 |postscript=, as quoted in Fensch 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Heloise P. Mailloux wrote in ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'', "This is a fine book for remedial purposes, but self-conscious children often refuse material if its seems meant for younger children."&lt;ref name="mailloux"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mailloux|first=Heloise P.|title=Late Spring Book List|newspaper=[[The Horn Book Magazine]]|date=June 1957 |postscript=, as quoted in Nel 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She felt that the book's limited vocabulary kept it from reaching "the absurd excellence of early Seuss books".&lt;ref name="mailloux"/&gt;

Based on a 2007 online poll, the [[National Education Association]] named ''The Cat in the Hat'' one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children".&lt;ref name=NEA2007&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm/ |title= Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children |author= National Education Association |year= 2007|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was ranked number 36 among the "Top 100 Picture Books" in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]'' – the third of five Dr. Seuss books on the list.&lt;ref name=SLJPicture2012&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/06/top-100-picture-books-poll-results |title= Top 100 Picture Books Poll Results |author= Bird, Elizabeth |publisher= ''A Fuse #8 Production''.

The book's fiftieth anniversary in 2007 prompted a reevaluation of the book from some critics. Yvonne Coppard, reviewing the fiftieth anniversary edition in ''Carousel'' magazine, wondered if the popularity of the Cat and his "delicious naughty behavior" will endure another fifty years. Coppard wrote, "The innocent ignorance of bygone days has given way to an all-embracing, almost paranoid awareness of child protection issues. And here we have the mysterious stranger who comes in, uninvited, while your mother is out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coppard|first1=Yvonne|title=''The Cat in the Hat'' Review|journal=Carousel|date=Autumn 2007|issue=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Philip Nel places the book's title character in the tradition of con artists in American art, including the title characters from [[Meredith Willson]]'s ''[[The Music Man]]'' and [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref name="nel-analysis"&gt;Nel 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;118-119&lt;/ref&gt; Nel also contends that Geisel identified with the Cat, pointing to a self portrait of Geisel in which he appears as the Cat, which was published alongside a profile about him in ''The Saturday Evening Post'' on July 6, 1957.&lt;ref name="nel-analysis"/&gt; [[Michael K. Frith]], who worked as Geisel's editor, concurs, arguing that "The Cat in the Hat and Ted Geisel were inseparable and the same. I think there's no question about it. This is someone who delighted in the chaos of life, who delighted in the seeming insanity of the world around him."&lt;ref name="nel-analysis"/&gt; Ruth MacDonald asserts that the Cat's primary goal in the book is to create fun for the children. The Cat calls it "fun that is funny", which MacDonald distinguishes from the ordinary, serious fun that parents subject their children to.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;110&amp;ndash;111&lt;/ref&gt; In an article titled "Was the Cat in the Hat Black?", Philip Nel draws connections between the Cat and stereotyped depictions of African-Americans, including [[minstrel shows]], Geisel's own minstrel-inspired cartoons from early in his career, and the use of the term "cat" to refer to jazz musicians.&lt;ref name="Cat-Black"/&gt; According to Nel, "Even as [Geisel] wrote books designed to challenge prejudice, he never fully shed the cultural assumptions he grew up with, and was likely unaware of the ways in which his visual imagination replicated the racial ideologies he consciously sought to reject."&lt;ref name="Cat-Black"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nel|first1=Philip|title=Was the Cat in the Hat Black?: Exploring Dr. Seuss’s Racial Imagination|journal=Children's Literature|date=2014|volume=42|issue=1|pages=71-98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cotton Mather.jpg|thumb|right|Geisel once called the fish in ''The Cat in the Hat'' "my version of [[Cotton Mather]]".]]
Geisel once called the fish "my version of [[Cotton Mather]]", the Puritan moralist who advised the prosecutors during the [[Salem witch trials]].&lt;ref name="nel 40"&gt;Nel 2007,&amp;nbsp;40&lt;/ref&gt; Betty Mensch and Alan Freeman support this view, writing, "Drawing on old Christian symbolism (the fish was an ancient sign of Christianity) Dr. Seuss portrays the fish as a kind of ever-nagging superego, the embodiment of utterly conventionalized morality."&lt;ref name="nel 40"/&gt; Philip Nel notes that other critics have also compared the fish to the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Super-ego|superego]]. Anna Quindlen called the Cat "pure id" and marked the children, as mediators between the Cat and the fish, as the ego.&lt;ref name="nel 40"/&gt; Mensch and Freeman, however, argue that the Cat shows elements of both id and ego.&lt;ref name="nel 40"/&gt;

In her analysis of the fish, MacDonald asserts that it represents the voice of the children's absent mother.&lt;ref name="macdonald-fish"&gt;MacDonald 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;114&amp;ndash;115&lt;/ref&gt; Its conflict with the Cat, not only over the Cat's uninvited presence but also their inherent predator-prey relationship, provides the tension of the story. She points out that on the last page, while the children are hesitant to tell their mother about what happened in her absence, the fish gives a knowing look to the readers to assure them "that something did go on but that silence is the better part of valor in this case".&lt;ref name="macdonald-fish"/&gt; [[Alison Lurie]] agrees, writing, "there is a strong suggestion that they might not tell her."&lt;ref name="lurie"&gt;Lurie 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;70&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that, in the Cat's destruction of the house, "the kids&amp;mdash;and not only those in the story, but those who read it&amp;mdash;have vicariously given full rein to their destructive impulses without guilt or consequences."&lt;ref name="lurie"/&gt; For a 1983 article, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, "''The Cat in the Hat'' is a revolt against authority, but it's ameliorated by the fact that the Cat cleans up everything at the end. It's revolutionary in that it goes as far as [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] and then stops. It doesn't go quite as far as [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cott 1983, p.&amp;nbsp;117&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Pease notes that ''The Cat in the Hat'' shares some structural similarities with other Dr. Seuss books. Like earlier books, ''The Cat in the Hat'' starts with "a child's feeling of discontent with his mundane circumstances" which is soon enhanced by make believe.&lt;ref name="Pease 103"&gt;Pease 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;103&amp;ndash;105&lt;/ref&gt; The book starts in a factual, realistic world, which crosses over into the world of make believe with the loud bump that heralds the arrival of the Cat.&lt;ref name="Pease 103"/&gt; However, this is the first Dr. Seuss book in which the fantasy characters, i.e. the Cat and his companions, are not products of the children's imagination.&lt;ref name="Pease 103"/&gt; It also differs from previous books in that Sally and her brother actively participate in the fantasy world; they also have a changed opinion of the Cat and his world by the story's end.&lt;ref name="Pease 103"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Ruth MacDonald asserts, "''The Cat in the Hat'' is the book that made Dr. Seuss famous. Without ''The Cat'', Seuss would have remained a minor light in the history of children's literature."&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;105&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Pease concurs, writing, "''The Cat in the Hat'' is the classic in the archive of Dr. Seuss stories for which it serves as a cornerstone and a linchpin. Before writing it Geisel was better known for the [[FLIT#"Quick, Henry, the Flit!"|'Quick, Henry, the Flit!']] ad campaign than for his nine children's books."&lt;ref name="pease-popularity"&gt;Pease 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;111&amp;ndash;112&lt;/ref&gt; The publication and popularity of the book thrust Geisel into the center of the United States literacy debate, what Pease called "the most important academic controversy" of the [[Cold War]] era.&lt;ref name="pease-popularity"/&gt; Academic [[Louis Menand]] contends that "''The Cat in the Hat'' transformed the nature of primary education and the nature of children's books. It not only stood for the idea that reading ought to be taught by phonics; it also stood for the idea that language skills—and many other subjects—ought to be taught through illustrated storybooks, rather than primers and textbooks."&lt;ref&gt;Menand 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, "It is the book I'm proudest of because it had something to do with the death of the ''Dick and Jane'' primers."&lt;ref name = "Cott 115"/&gt;

[[File:WhiteHouseTheCatintheHat2003.jpg|left|300px|thumb|A ''Cat in the Hat'' Christmas decoration in the [[White House]], 2003]]

The book led directly to the creation of [[Beginner Books]], a publishing house centered on producing books like ''The Cat in the Hat'' for beginning readers.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; According to Judith and Neil Morgan, when the book caught the attention of Phyllis Cerf, the wife of Geisel's publisher, [[Bennett Cerf]], she arranged for a meeting with Geisel, where the two agreed to create Beginner Books.&lt;ref name="morgan bb"&gt;Morgan 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;156&amp;ndash;157&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel became the president and editor, and the Cat in the Hat served as their mascot. Geisel's wife, Helen, was made third partner. Random House served as distributor&lt;ref name="morgan bb"/&gt; until 1960, when Random House purchased Beginner Books.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;167&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel wrote multiple books for the series, including ''[[The Cat in the Hat Comes Back]]'' (1958), ''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]'' (1960), ''[[Hop on Pop]]'' (1963), and ''[[Fox in Socks]]'' (1965).&lt;ref name="first edition"&gt;{{cite web|title=First Edition Beginner Books|url=http://1stedition.net/beginnerbooks.html|publisher=1stedition.net|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially used word lists of limited vocabularies to create these books, as he had with ''The Cat in the Hat'', but moved away from the lists as he came to believe "that a child could learn any amount of words if fed them slowly and if the books were amply illustrated".&lt;ref&gt;"Somebody's Got to Win" 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;126&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors also contributed notable books to the series, including ''A Fly Went By'' (1958), ''[[Sam and the Firefly]]'' (1958), ''[[Go, Dog. Go!]]'' (1961), and ''[[The Big Honey Hunt]]'' (1962).&lt;ref name="first edition"/&gt;

The book, or elements of it, has been mentioned multiple times in United States politics. The image of the Cat balancing many objects on his body while in turn balancing himself on a ball has been included in political cartoons and articles. Political caricaturists have portrayed both [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush]] in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Nel 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;48&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Mad (magazine)|''MAD'' magazine]] published "The Strange Similarities Between the Bush Administration and the World of Dr. Seuss", an article which matched quotes from White House officials to excerpts taken from Dr. Seuss books, and in which [[George W. Bush]]'s [[State of the Union]] promises were contrasted with the Cat vowing (in part), "I can hold up the cup and the milk and the cake!  I can hold up these books!  And the fish on a rake!"&lt;ref&gt;MAD Magazine #447, November 2004, Drucker/Devlin&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, during the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]], Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] compared the impasse over a bill to reform immigration with the mess created by the Cat. He read lines of the book from the Senate floor.&lt;ref name="Senate"&gt;{{cite news|title=Snubbing the White House, Without Snubbing the White House|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/07/AR2007060702206_2.html|author=Dana Milbank|date=June 8, 2007 | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then carried forward his analogy hoping the impasse would be straightened out for "If you go back and read Dr. Seuss, the cat manages to clean up the mess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate tries to cool immigration bill heat|author=Stephen Dinan|work=The Washington Times|date=June 6, 2007 |url=http://www.washtimes.com/national/20070606-123944-6924r.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued a stamp featuring the Cat in the Hat.&lt;ref&gt;Fensch 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;176&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Cat in the Hat''{{'}}s popularity also led to increased popularity and exposure for Geisel's previous children's books. For example, 1940's ''[[Horton Hatches the Egg]]'' had sold 5,801 copies in its opening year and 1,645 the following year. In 1958, the year after the publication of ''The Cat in the Hat'', 27,643 copies of ''Horton'' were sold, and by 1960 the book had sold a total of over 200,000 copies.&lt;ref name="pease-popularity"/&gt;

===Animated Film in Development===

In 2012, following the financial success of ''[[The Lorax (film)|The Lorax]]'', the animated film adaptation of [[The Lorax|the Dr. Seuss book of the same name]], [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Illumination Entertainment]] announced plans to produce a CGI adaptation of the book.&lt;ref name="cartoon"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.bcdb.com/cat-hat-animated-feature-3528/ |title=The Cat In The Hat comes back as animated feature |first=Ethan |last=Minovitz |newspaper=Big Cartoon News |date=March 18, 2012 |accessdate=March 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121203093819/http://blog.bcdb.com/cat-hat-animated-feature-3528/ |archive-date=December 3, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Lieber was set to write the script, with [[Chris Meledandri]] as producer, and [[Audrey Geisel]] as the executive producer. However, the project never came into fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/new-cat-hat-movie-works-warner-bros-1077973|title=New 'Cat in the Hat' Movie in the Works From Warner Bros.|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 24, 2018|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 24, 2018, it was announced that [[Warner Animation Group]] was in development of an animated ''Cat in the Hat'' film as part of a creative partnership with Seuss Enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thewrap.com/cat-in-the-hat-animated-film-dr-seuss-franchise-warner-bros/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage adaptation===
In 2009, the [[Royal National Theatre]] created a stage version of the book, adapted and directed by [[Katie Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Charles|title=The Cat in the Hat at the National Theatre, review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturecritics/6835238/The-Cat-in-the-Hat-at-the-National-Theatre-review.html|accessdate=27 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Seussical]]'', a musical adaptation that incorporates aspects of many Dr. Seuss works, features the Cat in the Hat as narrator.&lt;ref name=connema&gt;{{cite web|last=Connema|first=Richard|title=Seussical is a Charming Musical|url=http://www.talkinbroadway.com/regional/sanfran/s808.html|publisher=Talkin Broadway|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical received weak reviews when it opened, in November 2001, but eventually became a staple in regional and school theaters.&lt;ref name=connema/&gt; 

===Attraction===
A ride at Universal Studios' [[Islands of Adventure]] park in Orlando, Florida, has a ''Cat in the Hat'' theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orlandoinformer.com/universal/cat-in-the-hat/|title=Cat in the Hat at Universal's Islands of Adventure|work=Orlando Informer|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational Software===
In 1997, The book was made into a [[Living Books]] adaption for the PC and then, there were similar differences to reflect the new media such as Conrad sings his lines at the subtitles of the story as the narrator in the rainy day.

'''''The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up, 1838''''' is an [[oil painting]] by the English artist [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]]. It was painted in 1838 and exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1839.&lt;ref name="Willis266"&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis |title=The Fighting Temeraire |page=266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 98-gun ship [[HMS Temeraire (1798)|HMS ''Temeraire'']] was one of the last [[second-rate]] [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] to have played a distinguished role in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. The painting depicts HMS ''Temeraire'' being towed by a paddle-wheel steam tug towards its final berth in [[Rotherhithe]] in south-east London in 1838 to be broken up for scrap. The painting hangs in the [[National Gallery]], London, having been bequeathed to the nation by the artist in 1851. In 2005 it was [[Greatest Painting in Britain Vote|voted the nation's favourite painting]] in a poll organised by [[BBC Radio 4]]'s [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|''Today'' programme]].&lt;ref name="Willis268"&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis |title=The Fighting Temeraire |page=268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
When Turner came to paint this picture he was at the height of his career, having exhibited at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]], London, for 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/joseph-mallord-william-turner-the-fighting-temeraire |title=''The Fighting Temeraire'' |publisher=[[National Gallery]] |accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was renowned for his highly atmospheric paintings in which he explored the subjects of the weather, the sea and the effects of light. He spent much of his life near the River Thames and did many paintings of ships and waterside scenes, both in watercolour and in oils.  Turner frequently made small sketches and then worked them into finished paintings in the studio.

He may or may not have witnessed the actual towing of ''Temeraire'' and used considerable licence in the painting which had a symbolic meaning for him, that his first audience immediately appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 310–314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moyle, 383&lt;/ref&gt; Turner had been eighteen years old when Britain entered the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and "had a strong patriotic streak".  The ''Temeraire'' was a very well-known ship from her heroic performance at Trafalgar, and her sale by the Admiralty had attracted substantial press coverage, which was probably what brought the subject to his attention.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 309–310, 309 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
[[File:Turner, J. M. W. - The Fighting Téméraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Detail]]
The composition of this painting is unusual in that the most significant object, the old warship, is positioned well to the left of the painting, where it rises in stately splendour and almost ghostlike colours against a triangle of blue sky and rising mist that throws it into relief. The beauty of the old ship is in stark contrast to the dirty blackened [[tugboat]] with its tall [[chimney|smokestack]], which scurries across the still surface of the river.

Turner has used the triangle of blue to frame a second triangle of masted ships, which progressively decrease in size as they become more distant. ''Temeraire'' and tugboat have passed a small river craft with its [[gaff rig]]ged [[sail]] barely catching a breeze. Beyond this a [[square rig|square-rigger]] drifts, with every bit of sail extended. Another small craft shows as a patch of white farther down the river. In the far distance, beyond the second tugboat which makes its way towards them, a three-[[mast (sailing)|mast]]ed ship rides at anchor. The becalmed sailing vessels show the obsolescence of sail.

On the opposite side of the painting to ''Temeraire'', and exactly the same distance from the frame as the ship's main mast, the sun sets above the estuary, its rays extending into the clouds above it, and across the surface of the water. The flaming red of the clouds is reflected in the river. It exactly repeats the colour of the smoke which pours from the funnel of the tugboat. The sun setting symbolises the end of an epoch in the history of the British Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Venning, B (2003) "Turner" p.&amp;nbsp;241&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind ''Temeraire'', a gleaming sliver of the waxing moon casts a silvery beam across the river, symbolising the commencement of the new, industrial era.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 326&lt;/ref&gt; The demise of heroic strength is the subject of the painting, and it has been suggested that the ship stands for the artist himself, with an accomplished and glorious past but now contemplating his mortality. Turner called the work his "darling", which may have been due to its beauty, or his identification with the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Wilton, p. 212;  ''citing'' Hawes, pp. 34–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Newbolt|Sir Henry Newbolt]] wrote later a ballad titled ''The Fighting Temeraire'', describing the same scene: "And she's fading down the river, But in England's song for ever, She's the Fighting Téméraire."

== Artistic licence ==
[[File:Turner, J. M. W. - The Fighting Téméraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken (cropped2).jpg|thumb|Detail of bottom right corner]]
Turner took some artistic licence with the painting.  The ship was known to her crew as "Saucy", rather than "Fighting" ''Temeraire''.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |last=Reynolds |first=Nigel |title=Turner's ''Fighting Temeraire'' sinks the opposition |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=6 September 2005 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1497703/Turners-Fighting-Temeraire-sinks-the-opposition.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before being sold to the ship-breaker John Beatson, the ship had been lying at [[Sheerness Dockyard]], and was then moved to his [[wharf]] at [[Rotherhithe]].&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 309&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in a "prosaic drawing, made on the spot by a trained observer" (William Beatson, the ship-breaker's brother) and turned into a [[lithograph]], her masts and rigging were removed before her sale and journey to the breaker's yard.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 309&lt;/ref&gt; All of her cannon, anchors and assorted hardware had been removed and salvaged for the navy to use as spare parts.&lt;ref name="jmwt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 308–309&lt;/ref&gt; She was towed by two tugboats, not just one,&lt;ref&gt;Hawes. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the other direction (the sun sets in the west, while the Thames estuary is at the river's eastern end).&lt;ref&gt;Hawes, noting that: "Also, the locale of the painting may possibly be "Lime House Reach," near Greenwich and Rotherhithe, which runs south for a brief stretch; this is the one area along the Thames where the setting September sun would appear, in actuality, to the right of the ship, albeit considerably farther to the right than in the painting". Hawes, p. 43, footnote 6.  However, since it is unlikely Turner actually saw the journey from any vantage place, the point is moot.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the painting ==
When exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839 the painting was a considerable success, praised in various of the lengthy press reviews that the Summer Exhibitions then received as a "grand image of the last days of one of Britain's bulwarks" as ''[[The Spectator]]'' put it.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 313, edition of 11 May 1839&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], reviewing for ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' "in the form of mostly facetious letters" supposedly by "Michael Angelo Titmarsh Esq." abandoned his usual flippant tone when discussing "as grand a picture as ever figured on the walls of any academy, or came from the easel of any painter".&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 313, edition 1839, X for June&lt;/ref&gt; Turner displayed the painting in 1839 accompanied by an altered excerpt from [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]]'s poem ''Ye Mariners of England'', reading:

&lt;poem&gt;
: The flag which braved the battle and the breeze,
: No longer owns her.&lt;ref name="Adkin310"&gt;{{cite book |last=Adkin |title=The Trafalgar Companion |page=310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Willis274"&gt;{{cite book |last=Willis|title=The Fighting Temeraire |page=274 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jmwt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.j-m-w-turner.co.uk/turner-temeraire.htm |publisher=William Turner, Painter of Light j-m-w-turner.co.uk |title=The Fighting Temeraire, tugged to her Last Berth to be broken up, 1838, 91×122 cm National Gallery |accessdate=8 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Turner kept the painting in his studio, which also functioned as a showroom for buyers, until his death. In 1844 he lent it as part of his deal for reproductions to the print publisher J. Hogarth, who exhibited it at his premises, but about a year later wrote a draft note replying to another request saying that "no consid[eratio]ns of money or favour can induce me to lend my Darling again...".  Hogarth's [[steel engraving]] by [[James Tibbits Willmore]], who had often engraved Turners, was published in 1845 and was the first of many reproductions in various techniques.&lt;ref name="Egerton, 306"&gt;Egerton, 306&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1848 Turner refused an offer to buy the painting reputed to have been £5,000, followed by a "blank cheque", having determined to leave it to the nation, and already being very well-off.&lt;ref name="Egerton, 314"&gt;Egerton, 314&lt;/ref&gt;

It was evidently usually among the works on display in the studio, and is mentioned by several visitors.&lt;ref name="Egerton, 314"/&gt; He intended to leave his paintings to the nation but the terms of his will were unclear and after his death in 1851 his will was contested by relatives, and several years of litigation were only ended in 1856, when this and a large body of other work entered the collection of the National Gallery.  Most of the "Turner Bequest" was turned over to [[Tate Britain]] when that was established in 1897, but the ''Fighting Temeraire'' remained in the National Gallery.  It was in the Tate Gallery (as it then was) from 1910 to 1914 and 1960 to 1961, and for six months in 1987 to mark the opening of the Clore Gallery there, which houses the rest of the Bequest.  In 1947–48 it went on a European tour to Amsterdam, [[Bern]], Paris, [[Brussels]], [[Liège]], ending at the [[Venice Biennale]]. In 1952 it was exhibited in [[Cape Town]].&lt;ref name="Egerton, 306"/&gt;

The picture remains in "exceptionally good condition", apart from slightly discoloured [[varnish]], and seems never to have received conservation treatment beyond the removal of surface dirt in 1945 and a lining in 1963. X-ray images reveal that Turner seems to have used a canvas on which he had started another marine picture, with a large sail where the tugboat's above deck structures now are.&lt;ref name="Egerton, 306"/&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The painting is used in the 2012 James Bond film ''[[Skyfall]]'' to be symbolic of Bond's age and current standing within MI6:

Q: "Always makes me feel a little melancholy. Grand old war ship, being ignominiously hauled away for scrap... The inevitability of time, don't you think? What do you see?"

Bond: "A bloody big ship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theartofilm.blogspot.com/2012/11/skyfall-fighting-temeraire.html|title=The Art of Film : Skyfall: The Fighting Temeraire|author=The Art of Film|date=20 November 2012|publisher=Theartofilm.blogspot.com|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Philosophical Review''''' is a quarterly [[academic journal|journal]] of [[philosophy]] edited by the faculty of the Sage School of Philosophy at [[Cornell University]] and published by [[Duke University Press]] (since September 2006). The journal publishes original work in all areas of [[analytic philosophy]], but emphasizes material that is of general interest to academic philosophers. Each issue of the journal contains approximately two to four articles along with several book reviews.  It was ranked the best English-language general philosophy journal in a poll conducted on the popular philosophy blog Leiter Reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Brian Leiter |date =2009|title = The Highest Quality "General" Philosophy Journals in English|url = http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2009/03/the-highest-quality-general-philosophy-journals-in-english.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal has been in continuous publication since 1892. Volume I contained articles by [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]].

'''The Short North''' is a neighborhood in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]], United States, centered on the main strip of High Street immediately north of downtown and extending until just south of the [[Ohio State University]] [[campus]] area.  It is an easy walk from the convention center or [[Nationwide Arena]] district to the south. The Short North is often crowded on weekends, particularly during the monthly "Gallery Hop" and other local and downtown events.

The Short North has been described as "colorful", "offbeat", and "trendy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelley|first=Shawnie|title=Insiders' Guide to Columbus, Ohio, 2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I6S6f16eE1sC&amp;pg=PA264|year=2008|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=978-0-7627-4784-9|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biddle|first1=Julie King|last2=(MLS.)|first2=Barbara White|title=The Power of We: The Ohio Study Group Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cE_0d6x1jUsC&amp;pg=PA85|year=2010|publisher=IAP|isbn=978-1-61735-029-0|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district is heavily populated with [[art gallery|art galleries]], specialty shops, [[pub]]s, [[nightclub]]s, and [[coffee house]]s.  Most of its tightly packed brick buildings date from at least the early 20th century, with traditional storefronts along High Street (often with brightly painted murals on their side walls), and old apartment buildings and [[rowhouse]]s and newer [[condominium]] developments in the surrounding blocks.  The city installed 17 lighted metal archways extending across High Street throughout the Short North, reminiscent of such arches present in the area in the early 1900s.

The area is also known to be a very [[gay]]- and [[lesbian]]-friendly neighborhood which contains numerous gay nightclubs and bars and hosts the annual Columbus gay [[Columbus Pride|pride parade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parade|url=https://columbuspride.org/parade/|website=Stonewall Columbus|publisher=Stonewall Columbus|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The name "Short North" traces its roots back to the vernacular used by police for the area during a period of decline, namely as the neighborhood that—from a suburban commuter's perspective—had fallen 'just short' of the central business district's north end—both physically and economically. A reputation for diversity and an artistic,&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/travel/14headsup.html "Hello, Columbus"], Ingrid Williams. New York Times. 14 mar 2010. Retrieved 6 sept 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] atmosphere has marked the Short North, with land prices and local rents rising steadily from the humble beginnings as a squatter’s neighborhood in the 1980s.  Prior to this gentrification of the neighborhood which originated from artists,&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; it had suffered prolonged decay and from latent, street-level crime and gang violence as Columbus affluent residents followed the economic bubble outward—into the [[suburb]]s—during the 1960s and 1970s.

The 1980s saw the neighborhood's rebirth enter into full gear as galleries began to open up and started to flourish. As Maria Gallowy owner of [[pm gallery]] the oldest gallery in the Short North once put it "It was one of those neighborhoods that artists love to move into because the possibilities are there."&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; In 1984 two Short North area galleries —the now defunct Art Reach and the still thriving pm gallery— began opening new exhibits on the first Saturday of every month to help cross-promote their businesses and build a more unified community.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; This loose coordination later evolved into the [[Gallery Hop]] which is still held every first Saturday of the month. The Gallery Hop today features most businesses keeping their doors open late into the night, jam-packed streets, and sidewalks populated with street musicians and other performers.

Since 1983, the Short North has also hosted the annual [[Doo Dah Parade]], a parody of typical [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] parades that includes politically slanted paraders and floats as well as absurdities such as the "Marching Fidels," a band of [[Fidel Castro]] lookalikes.  The parade starts in neighboring [[Victorian Village]], at [[Goodale Park]], and winds north to finish coming south down High Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Doo Dah Parade|url=http://www.doodahparade.com/|website=The Doo Dah Parade|publisher=The Friends of Doo Dah|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Short North also hosts HighBall Halloween, Masquerade on High, a fashion show and street parade that closes down High Street. In 2011, in its 4th year, HighBall Halloween gained notoriety as it accepted its first Expy award. HighBall Halloween has much to offer for those interested in fashion and the performing and visual arts or for those who want to celebrate Halloween and with food and drinks from all around the city. Each year the event is put on with a different theme and it increases in size and popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HighBall - You Are What You Wear|url=http://highballcolumbus.org/|website=HighBall Columbus|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wayne's World''''' is a 1992 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Penelope Spheeris]], produced by [[Lorne Michaels]], and written by [[Mike Myers]] and [[Bonnie and Terry Turner]]. It stars Myers in his feature film debut as Wayne Campbell and [[Dana Carvey]] as Garth Algar, a pair of rock fans who broadcast a [[public-access television|public-access television show]]. It also features [[Rob Lowe]], [[Tia Carrere]], [[Lara Flynn Boyle]], [[Brian Doyle-Murray]], [[Chris Farley]], [[Ed O'Neill]], [[Ione Skye]], [[Meat Loaf]], and [[Alice Cooper]].

''Wayne's World'' was released in the US on February 14, 1992. It was the eighth-highest-grossing film of 1992 and it remains the highest-grossing [[List of Saturday Night Live feature films|film based on ''Saturday Night Live'' skits]]. A sequel, ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'', was released on December 10, 1993.

==Plot==
In [[Aurora, Illinois]], rock fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar host a [[public-access television]] show, ''Wayne's World'', from Wayne's parents' basement. After they sell the rights to the show to television producer Benjamin Oliver for $10,000, they celebrate at a night club, where they avoid Wayne's troubled ex-girlfriend Stacy. Wayne falls for Cassandra Wong, vocalist and bassist of the band performing that night, Crucial Taunt, and impresses her with his [[Cantonese]]. He purchases a 1964 [[Fender Stratocaster]] electric guitar he has long coveted.

Benjamin attempts to steal Cassandra from Wayne by using his wealth and good looks. He distracts Wayne and Garth with all-access tickets to an [[Alice Cooper]] concert in Milwaukee, while offering to produce a [[music video]] for Crucial Taunt. At the concert, Wayne and Garth make the acquaintance of a bodyguard to music producer Frankie Sharp, head of Sharp Records.

While filming the revamped ''Wayne's World'' under Benjamin's oversight, Wayne and Garth find it difficult to adjust to the professional studio environment. Their contract obliges them to give a promotional interview to their [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]], Noah Vanderhoff, who owns a franchise of [[amusement arcade]]s. After Wayne publicly ridicules Vanderhoff, he is fired from the show, causing a rift in his friendship with Garth. Jealous of the attention Benjamin is giving Cassandra, Wayne attempts to prevent her from participating in the Crucial Taunt music video shoot. She breaks up with him, furious at his lack of trust.

Wayne and Garth reunite and hatch a plan to win Cassandra back by having Sharp hear Crucial Taunt play. While Garth and their friends infiltrate a satellite station with the aid of Benjamin's assistant, Wayne goes to Cassandra's video shoot, but embarrasses himself in an attempt to expose Benjamin's ulterior motive. As he leaves, Cassandra changes her mind about Benjamin. Wayne apologizes and they return to Aurora.

The ''Wayne's World'' crew hacks into Sharp's satellite television and broadcast the Crucial Taunt performance from Wayne's basement, where Sharp and Benjamin converge. Sharp declines to offer Crucial Taunt a record contract, Cassandra breaks up with Wayne and departs with Benjamin for a tropical resort, Stacy reveals that she is pregnant with Wayne's child, and a fire destroys Wayne's house.

Dissatisfied, Wayne and Garth turn to the film's audience and halt proceedings. They restart the scene and unmask Benjamin as "Old Man Withers" in a ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' parody ending. Still unsatisfied, they start again with a "mega happy ending" in which Cassandra signs a record contract and reunites with Wayne, Garth begins a relationship with a waitress, and Benjamin learns that money and good looks do not necessarily bring happiness.

==Production==
''Wayne's World'' was greenlit by [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1991. It was the second [[List of Saturday Night Live feature films|film based on a ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch]] following ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2017/02/02/mike-myers-couldnt-drive-during-waynes-world/ |title=Mike Myers couldn't drive during 'Wayne's World' |work=[[New York Post]] |date=2017-02-02 |accessdate=2017-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Lorne Michaels]] hired [[Penelope Spheeris]] to direct, who had directed several music [[documentary film|documentaries]]. Spheeris said, "I had been just struggling as a female director in this business for many years. I was 45 years old when I got that job. I just kept hanging in there. And ''Wayne's World'' happened, and it sort of flipped my life around."&lt;ref name="Vanity-Fair"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pirnia |first=Garin |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/wanyes-world-25th-anniversary-penelope-spheeris-interview |title=How Wayne's World Made—and Broke—Its Director's Career |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=2017-02-06 |accessdate=2017-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spheeris clashed with Myers during filming. She told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that Myers was "emotionally needy and got more difficult as the shoot went along. You should have heard him bitching when I was trying to do that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' scene: 'I can't move my neck like that! Why do we have to do this so many times? No one is going to laugh at that!'" She said she attempted to assuage Myers by having her daughter provide him snacks,&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2008/06/16/mike-myers-man-mystery/|title=Mike Myers: Man of Mystery|date=2008-06-16|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on one occasion he stormed off the set, upset that there was no margarine for his bagel.&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; Myers and Spheeris argued over the [[final cut (film editing)|final cut]] of the film, causing Myers to prevent Spheeris from directing ''[[Wayne's World 2|Wayne' World 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Brandon Kirby |agency= |title=Mike Myers, Dana Carvey Set Aside 'Wayne's World' Feud at Academy Screening |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/waynes-world-feud-mike-myers-445044 |quote=Carvey and Spheeris both notoriously fell out with Myers despite the 1992 film's huge success. Myers is said to have blocked Spheeris from directing the 1993 sequel because she'd ignored his edit suggestions on the original. |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 24, 2013 |accessdate=2015-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |agency= |title=How Mike Myers and Dana Carvey Resolved Their 'Wayne's World'-'Austin Powers' Feud |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/waynes-world-how-mike-myers-436879 |quote=Myers blocked Spheeris from directing the 1993 sequel because she'd ignored his edit suggestions on the original (her cut already had tested well).

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an 84% "Certified Fresh" rating based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10, with the critical consensus stating, "An oddball comedy that revels in its silliness and memorable catchphrases, ''Wayne's World'' is also fondly regarded because of its endearing characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/waynes_world/|title=Wayne's World|website=Rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 53 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/waynes-world |title=Wayne's World Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Roger Ebert]] said in his review: "I walked into ''Wayne's World'' expecting a lot of dumb, vulgar comedy, and I got plenty, but I also found what I didn't expect: a genuinely amusing, sometimes even intelligent, undercurrent." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/waynes-world-1992|title=Wayne's World Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1992) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=Rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Desson Howe]] wrote in the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' that making a movie out of such a "teeny sketch" is "better than you'd expect" but criticized the finale as "an attempt to lampoon movie endings" "and a despair-driven inability to end the movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/waynesworldpg13howe_a0aea2.htm|title=Wayne's World (PG-13)|last=Howe|first=Desson|website=Washingtonpost.com|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on pop culture===
[[File:WaynesWorldAMCPacer.jpg|thumb|right|Wayne's World AMC Pacer clone at Planet Hollywood in New York City]]

Filled with [[pop culture]] references, the sketches and the film started catchphrases such as "''Schwing!''" and "[[Sarcasm|Schyea]]", as well as popularizing "[[That's what she said]]", "Party on!" and the use of "[[Not!]]" after apparently affirmative sentences in order to state the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2013/schwing-mike-myers-dana-carveys-waynes-world-reunion-recap/ |title=Schwing!

A '''wrap dress''' is a [[dress]] with a front closure formed by wrapping one side across the other, and knotting the attached ties that wrap around the back at the waist or fastening buttons. This forms a V-shaped neckline and hugs the wearer's curves. A '''faux wrap dress''' resembles this design, except that it comes already fastened together with no opening in front, but instead is slipped on over the head. A '''wrap top''' is a [[Top (clothing)|top]] cut and constructed in the same way as a wrap dress, but without a skirt.

The Fürstenberg interpretation of the wrap dress, which was consistently knee-length, in a clinging [[jersey (fabric)|jersey]], with long sleeves, was so popular and so distinctive that the style has generally become associated with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amanda-christine-miller/diane-von-furstenberg-on-_b_81590.html |first=Amanda Christine |last=Miller |date=January 16, 2008 |title=Diane von Fürstenberg On Wrap Dresses And The Joys Of Aging Gracefully |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="voguepedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Diane_von_Furstenberg |title=Diane von Fürstenberg |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/designers/diane-von-frstenberg/ |title=Diane von Fürstenberg |work=Fashion Model Directory |accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has stated that her divorce inspired the design,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diane von Fürstenberg Wrap Dress Inspired By Designer's Divorce|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/09/diane-von-furstenberg-wra_n_2103096.html|publisher=Huff Post|accessdate=4 February 2013|first=Kelsey|last=Borresen|date=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also suggested it was created in the spirit of enabling women to enjoy sexual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walden|first=Celia|title=Diane von Fürstenberg: interview|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG8430291/Diane-von-Furstenberg-interview.html|accessdate=13 January 2014|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=6 April 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 a book dedicated entirely to Fürstenberg's wrap dresses was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Talley|first=André Leon|title=Diane von Fürstenberg : the wrap|year=2004|publisher=Assouline|location=New York, NY|isbn=9782843235245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wrap dresses achieved their peak of popularity in the mid to late 1970s, and the design has been credited with becoming a symbol of [[women's liberation]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/wrap-superstar-designer-diane-von-furstenberg-tells-her-story-801189.html |title=Wrap superstar: Designer Diane von Fürstenberg tells her story |date=March 27, 2008 |work=The Independent on Sunday |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanenbaum"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Leora Tanenbaum]]|title=Because of Slut-Shaming, the Wrap Dress Still Matters|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leora-tanenbaum/because-of-slut-shaming-the-wrap-dress-still-matters_b_7769476.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=July 15, 2015|date=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They experienced renewed popularity beginning in the late 1990s, particularly after von Fürstenberg reintroduced her wrap dress in 1997; she, among others, has continued to design wrap dresses since then.&lt;ref name="voguepedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKean|first=Erin|title=The Hundred Dresses: The Most Iconic Styles of Our Time |year=2013 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=New York|isbn=9781608199761|page=201|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRxpwEHPLA4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA201#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|authorlink=Erin McKean|accessdate=May 6, 2013|quote="Revived in 1997, the dress again sold in the millions."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wrap dress's popularity and its perceived [[feminist]] significance have remained current into the mid-2010s.&lt;ref name="Tanenbaum" /&gt;

'''Zinaida Nikolayevna Gippius''' ({{Lang-rus|Зинаи́да Никола́евна Ги́ппиус|p=zʲɪnɐˈidə nʲɪkɐˈlajɪvnə ˈɡʲipʲɪus|a=Zinaida Nikolayevna Gippius.ru.vorb.oga}}; {{OldStyleDate|20 November|1869|8 November}} – 9 September 1945) was a [[Russian literature|Russian]] [[poet]], [[playwright]], [[novelist]], [[editor]] and religious thinker, one of the major figures in [[Russian symbolism]].&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web| author = Steve Shelokhonov| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2267001/bio| title = Zinaida Gippius biography| publisher = www.imdb.com| accessdate = 2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dic_lit"&gt;{{cite web| author =| url =http://www.bookrags.com/biography/zinaida-nikolayevna-gippius-dlb/ | title=  Zinaida Gippius| work= Dictionary of Literary Biography| accessdate= 2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of her marriage to [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]], which lasted 52 years, is described in her unfinished book ''Dmitry Merezhkovsky'' (Paris, 1951; Moscow, 1991).

She began writing at an early age, and by the time she met Dmitry Merezhkovsky in 1888, she was already a published poet. The two were married in 1889. Gippius published her first book of poetry, ''[[Collection of Poems. 1889–1903]]'', in 1903, and her second collection, ''[[Collection of Poems. Book 2. 1903-1909]]'', in 1910. After the [[1905 Revolution]], the Merezhkovskys became critics of Tsarism; they spent several years abroad during this time, including trips for treatment of health issues. They denounced the 1917 [[October Revolution]], seeing it as a cultural disaster, and in 1919 emigrated to Poland.

After living in Poland they moved to France, and then to Italy, continuing to publish and take part in Russian émigré circles, though Gippius's harsh literary criticism made enemies. The tragedy of the exiled Russian writer was a major topic for Gippius in emigration, but she also continued to explore mystical and covertly sexual themes, publishing short stories, plays, novels, poetry, and memoirs. The death of Merezhkovsky in 1941 was a major blow to Gippius, who died a few years later in 1945.

==Biography==
Zinaida Gippius was born on {{OldStyleDate|20 November|1869|8 November}}, in [[Belyov]], [[Tula Oblast|Tula]], the eldest of four sisters. Her father, Nikolai Romanovich Gippius, a respected lawyer and a senior officer in the Russian Senate, was a German-Russian, whose ancestor Adolphus von Gingst, later von Hippius, came to settle in Moscow in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Christa Ebert'' Sinaida Hippius: Seltsame Nahe. — Oberbaum Verlag: Berlin, 2004. — S.22.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Anastasia Vasilyevna ({{née}} Stepanova), was a daughter of the [[Yekaterinburg]] Chief of Police.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="krugosvet"&gt;{{cite web| author =| url= http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/kultura_i_obrazovanie/literatura/GIPPIUS_ZINAIDA_NIKOLAEVNA.html| title =  Gippius, Zinaida Nikolayevna| publisher  = www.krugosvet.ru| accessdate = 2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nikolai Gippius's job entailed constant traveling, and because of this his daughters received little formal education. Taking lessons from governesses and visiting tutors, they attended schools sporadically in whatever city ([[Saratov]], [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] and [[Kiev]], among others) the family happened to stay for a significant period of time.&lt;ref name="bibliotekar"&gt;{{cite web| author =| url = http://bibliotekar.ru/gippius-zinaida/index.htm| title = Biography and Diaries of Zinaida Gippius| publisher = bibliotekar.ru| accessdate  = 2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="makarenko"&gt;{{cite web| author = Makarenko, Svetlana| url = http://www.peoples.ru/art/literature/poetry/contemporary/gippius/| title  = Zinaida Nikolayevna Gippius.

Gippius | work= Russian Literature of the XX Century | accessdate = 2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, Zinaida had already studied for two years at a girls' school in Kiev (1877—1878) and for a year at the Moscow Fischer Gymnasium.&lt;ref name="orlov"/&gt; It was only in [[Borzhomi]] where her uncle Alexander, a man of considerable means, rented a [[dacha]] for her, that she started to get back to normal after the profound shock caused by her beloved father's death.&lt;ref name="orlov"&gt;{{cite web| author = Orlov, Vitaly| url = http://www.litwomen.ru/autogr20.html| title = Zinaida Gippius| publisher = www.litwomen.ru| accessdate= 2010-10-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226164047/http://www.litwomen.ru/autogr20.html|archivedate=2010-02-26|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zinaida started writing poetry at the age of seven. By the time she met Dmitry Merezhkovsky in 1888, she was already a published poet. "By the year 1880 I was writing verses, being a great believer in 'inspiration', and making it a point never to take my pen away from paper. People around me saw these poems as a sign of my being 'spoiled', but I never tried to conceal them and, of course, I wasn't spoiled at all, what with my religious upbringing," she wrote in 1902 in a letter to [[Valery Bryusov]].&lt;ref name="belousenko"&gt;{{cite web| author = Bogomolov, N.| url = http://www.belousenko.com/books/silver_age/gippius_bogomolov.htm| title =  Love is the One| publisher  = The Works of Zinaida Gippius| accessdate = 2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good-looking girl, Zinaida attracted a lot of attention in Borzhomi, but Merezhkovsky, a well-educated introvert, impressed her first and foremost as a perfect kindred spirit. Once he proposed, she accepted him without hesitation, and never came to regret what might have seemed a hasty decision.&lt;ref name="krugosvet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="orlov"/&gt;

Gippius and Merezhkovsky were married on 8 January 1889, in Tiflis. They had a short honeymoon tour involving a stay in the Crimea, then returned to Saint Petersburg and moved into a flat in what was known then as the Muruzi House, which Merezhkovsky's mother had rented and furnished for them as a wedding gift.&lt;ref name="russianculture"/&gt;

===Literary career===
[[File:ZinaidaGippius.jpg|thumb|left|Gippius, 13 December 1897]]
Merezhkovsky and Gippius made a pact, each promising to concentrate on what he or she did best, the former on poetry, the latter on prose. The agreement collapsed as Zinaida translated [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Manfred]]'', and Dimitry started working on his debut novel ''Julian the Apostate''.&lt;ref name="makarenko"/&gt; In Saint Petersburg Gippius joined the Russian Literary Society, became a member of the Shakespearean Circle (the celebrity lawyer Prince [[Alexander Ivanovich Urusov|Alexander Urusov]] being its most famous member), and met and befriended  [[Yakov Polonsky]], [[Apollon Maykov]], [[Dmitry Grigorovich]], [[Aleksey Pleshcheyev]] and [[Pyotr Veinberg]]. She became close to the group of authors associated with the renovated ''[[Severny Vestnik]]'', where she herself made her major debut as a poet in 1888.&lt;ref name="russianculture"/&gt;

In 1890–91 this magazine published her first short stories, "The Ill-Fated One" and "In Moscow". Then three of her novels, ''Without the Talisman'', ''The Winner'', and ''Small Waves'', appeared in ''[[Mir Bozhy]]''.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; Seeing the writing of mediocre, generic prose as a commercial enterprise, Gippius treated her poetry differently, as something utterly intimate, calling her verses 'personal prayers'. Dealing with the darker side of the human soul and exploring sexual ambiguity and [[narcissism]], many of those 'prayers' were considered blasphemous at the time.&lt;ref name="bibliotekar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="orlov"/&gt; Detractors called Gippius a 'demoness', the 'queen of duality', and a 'decadent Madonna'. Enjoying the notoriety, she exploited her androgynous image, used male clothes and pseudonyms, shocked her guests  with insults ('to watch their reaction', as she once explained to [[Nadezhda Teffi]]), and for a decade remained the Russian symbol of 'sexual liberation', holding high what she in one of her diary entries termed as the 'cross of sensuality'. In 1901 all this transformed into the ideology of the "New Church" of which she was the instigator.&lt;ref name="cyr_mef"&gt;{{cite web| author =Shchemeleva, L.M.| url= http://www.rhistory.ru/Gippius.html | title = Zinaida Nikolayevna Gippius| work= The Big Kirill and Mefody Encyclopedia| accessdate = 2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1903 the ''[[Collection of Poems. 1889–1903]]'', Gippius's first book of poetry, came out; [[Innokenty Annensky]] later called the book the "quintessence of fifteen years of Russian modernism." [[Valery Bryusov]] was greatly impressed too, praising the "insurmountable frankness with which she document[ed] the emotional progress of her enslaved soul."&lt;ref name="krugosvet"/&gt; Gippius herself never thought much of the social significance of her published poetry. In a foreword to her debut collection she wrote: "It is sad to realize that one had to produce something as useless and meaningless as this book. Not that I think poetry to be useless; on the contrary, I am convinced that it is essential, natural and timeless. There were times when poetry was read everywhere and appreciated by everybody. But those times are gone. A modern reader has no use for a book of poetry any more."&lt;ref name="makarenko"/&gt;

In the early 1900s the Muruzi House acquired the reputation of being one of the Russian capital's new cultural centers. Guests recognized and admired the hostess's authority and her talent for leadership, even if none of them found her particularly warm or affectionate.&lt;ref name="orlov"/&gt;

===The New Church===
[[File:Z. Gippius by L.Bakst (1906, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|right|thumb|Portrait of Gippius by [[Leon Bakst]], 1906]]
In 1899—1901, encouraged by the group of authors associated with ''[[Mir Iskusstva]]'', the magazine she had become close to, Gippius published critical essays in it using male pseudonyms, Anton Krainy being the best known.&lt;ref name="krugosvet"/&gt; Analyzing the roots of the crisis that Russian culture had fallen into, Gippius (somewhat paradoxically, given her 'demonic' reputation) suggested as a remedy the 'Christianization' of it, which in practice meant bringing the [[intelligentsia]] and the Church closer together. Merging faith and intellect, according to Gippius, was crucial for the survival of Russia; only religious ideas, she thought, would bring its people enlightenment and liberation, both sexual and spiritual.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;

In 1901 Gippius and Merezhkovsky co-founded the Religious and Philosophical Meetings. This 'gathering for free discussion', focusing on the synthesis of culture and religion, brought together an eclectic mix of intellectuals and was regarded in retrospect as an important, if short-lived attempt to pull Russia back from the major social upheavals it was headed for.&lt;ref name="chur_3"&gt;{{cite web | author =Tchurakov, D.O. | url = http://www.portal-slovo.ru/history/35131.php?ELEMENT_ID=35131&amp;PAGEN_2=3 | title = The Aesthetic of Russian Decadence in the Late XIX – Early XX Centuries. P.3 | publisher = www.portal-slovo.ru | accessdate = 2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gippius was the driving force behind the Meetings, as well as the magazine ''[[Novy Put]]'' (1903–04), launched initially as a vehicle for the former. By the time ''Novy Put'' folded (due to a conflict caused by the newcomer [[Sergei Bulgakov]]'s refusal to publish her essay on [[Alexander Blok]]), Gippius (as Anton Krainy) had become a prominent literary critic, contributing mostly to ''[[Vesy]]'' (Scales).&lt;ref name="cyr_mef"/&gt;

After the Meetings were closed in 1903, Gippius tried to revive her initial idea in the form of what was regarded as her 'domestic Church', based on the controversial Troyebratstvo (Brotherhood of Three), composed of herself, Merezhkovsky, and [[Dmitry Filosofov]], their mutual close friend and, for a short while, her lover. This new development outraged many of their friends, like [[Nikolai Berdyaev]] who saw this bizarre parody on the [[Trinity]], with its own set of quasi-religious rituals, as profanation bordering on blasphemy.&lt;ref name="russianculture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rulex"&gt;{{cite web| author =| url = http://www.rulex.ru/01040122.htm | title = Gippius Zinaida Nikolayevna| publisher= Brokhaus &amp; Efron | work= The Russian Biographical Dictionary| accessdate = 2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1905–1917===
[[File:Triumvirate by Re-Mi.jpg|thumb|left|Gippius, Merezhkovsky and Filosofov. Caricature by Re-Mi (Nikolai Remizov)]]
The [[1905 Revolution]] had a profound impact on Gippius. During the next decade the Merezhkovskys were harsh critics of [[Tsarism]], radical revolutionaries like [[Boris Savinkov]] now entering their narrow circle of close friends. In February 1906 the couple left for France to spend more than two years in what they saw as self-imposed exile, trying to introduce Western intellectuals to their 'new religious consciousness'. In 1906 Gippius published the collection of short stories ''Scarlet Sword'' (Алый меч), and in 1908 the play ''Poppie Blossom'' (Маков цвет) came out, with Merezhkovsky and Filosofov credited as co-authors.&lt;ref name="bibliotekar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cyr_mef"/&gt;

Disappointed with the indifference of European cultural elites to their ideas, the trio returned home. Back in Saint Petersburg Gippius's health deteriorated, and for the next six years she (along with her husband, who had heart problems) regularly visited European health resorts and clinics. During one such voyage in 1911 Gippius bought a cheap apartment in Paris, at Rue Colonel Bonnet, 11-bis. What at the time felt like a casual, unnecessary purchase, later saved them from homelessness abroad.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;

As the political tension in Russia subsided, the Meetings were re-opened as the Religious and Philosophical Society, in 1908. But Russian Church leaders ignored it, and soon the project withered into a mere literary circle. The heated discussion over the ''[[Vekhi]]'' manifesto led to a clash between the Merezhkovskys and Filosofov on the one hand and [[Vasily Rozanov]] on the other; the latter quit and severed ties with his old friends.

By the time her ''[[Collection of Poems. Book 2. 1903-1909]]'' came out in 1910, Gippius has become a well-known (though by no means as famous as her husband) European author, translated into German and French. In 1912 her book of short stories ''Moon Ants'' (Лунные муравьи) came out, featuring the best prose she had written in years. The two novels, ''The Demon Dolls'' (Чортовы куклы, 1911) and ''Roman-Tsarevich'' (Роман-царевич, 1912), were meant to be the first and the third book of the [[Hieromonk]] [[Iliodor]] trilogy, which remained unfinished. The literary left panned them as allegedly 'anti-revolutionary', mainstream critics found these books lackluster, formulaic and tendentious.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rulex"/&gt;

At the outbreak of [[World War I]], the Merezhkovskys spoke out against Russia's involvement. Still, Gippius launched a support-the-soldiers campaign of her own, producing a series of frontline-forwarded letters, each combining stylized folk poetic messages with small tobacco-packets, signed with either her own, or one of her three servant maids' names. Some dismissed it as pretentious and meaningless, others applauded what they saw as her reaction to the [[jingoism|jingoistic]] hysteria of the time.&lt;ref name="bibliotekar"/&gt;

===1917-1919===
The Merezhkovskys greeted the 1917 [[February Revolution]] and denounced the [[October Revolution]], blaming [[Alexander Kerensky]] and his [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional government]] for the catastrophe. In her book of memoirs ''Dmitry Merezhkovsky. Him and Us'' Gippius wrote: {{quote|Like mice for whom the world amounts to just themselves and cats, and nobody else, those 'revolutionaries' knew but one sort of distinction: that between the left and the right. Kerensky and his kind intrinsically saw themselves as the 'left', regarding their enemies as 'the right'. As the Revolution happened (not 'made' by them), the left triumphed, but – again, like mice in a basement where there are no more cats, they were still wary of the 'right' as the only source of fear, having in sight just one danger that in 1917 there was none of. They weren't afraid of the Bolsheviks – they belonged to the 'left' too. They never believed the Bolsheviks would be able to keep the power they had taken, and failed to notice how the latter, having stolen their slogans, started to use them with ingenuity, speaking of 'land for peasants', 'peace for everybody', 'the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Assembly]] reinstated', republic, freedom and all that...&lt;ref&gt;Gippius, Z.N. Memoirs. Dm. Merezhkovsky. Him and Us. Zakharov Publishers. Moscow, 2001. P.403.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:FilosofovMerejkovskyGippiusZlobin.JPG|thumb|right|Filosofov (left), Merezhkovsky (center),  Gippius, and Zlobin, circa 1919]]
Gippius saw the October Revolution as the end of Russia and the coming of the Kingdom of Antichrist. "It felt as if some pillow fell on you to strangle... Strangle what — the city? The country? No, something much, much bigger," — she wrote in her 26 October 1917, diary entry.&lt;ref name="orlov"/&gt; In late 1917 Gippius was still able to publish her anti-Bolshevik verses in what remained of the old newspapers, but the next year was nightmarish, according to her ''Diaries''. Ridiculing [[H. G. Wells]] ("I can see why he is so attracted to the Bolsheviks: they’ve leapfrogged him"), she wrote of [[Cheka]] atrocities ("In Kiev 1200 officers killed; legs severed, boots taken off." — 23 February. "In [[Rostov]] teenager [[cadet]]s shot down — for being mistakenly taken for [[Constitutional Democratic Party]] cadets, the banned ones." — 17 March), of mass hunger and her own growing feeling of dull indifference. "Those who still have a soul in them walk around like corpses: neither protesting, nor suffering, waiting for nothing, bodies and souls slumped into hunger-induced dormancy."&lt;ref name="makarenko"/&gt;

Expressing some sympathy for 'the weeping [[Lunacharsky]]' (the only Bolshevik leader to express at least some regret concerning the cruelties of the repressive organs), Gippius wrote: "The things that happen now have nothing to do with Russian history. They will be forgotten, like the atrocities of some savages on a faraway island; will vanish without a trace."&lt;ref name="makarenko"/&gt; ''Last Poems (1914–1918)'', published in 1918, presented a stark and gloomy picture of revolutionary Russia as Gippius saw it. After the defeats of [[Alexander Kolchak]] in [[Siberia]] and [[Anton Denikin]] in [[Southern Russia]], respectively, the Merezhkovskys moved to [[Petrograd]]. In late 1919, invited to join a group of 'red professors' in Crimea, Gippius chose not to, having heard of massacres orchestrated by local chiefs [[Bela Kun]] and [[Rosalia Zemlyachka]]. Having obtained permission to leave the city (the pretext being that they would head for the frontlines, with lectures on Ancient Egypt for [[Red Army]] fighters), Merezhkovsky and Gippius, as well as her secretary [[Vladimir Zlobin]] and Dmitry Filosofov, departed to [[Poland]] by train.&lt;ref name="makarenko"/&gt;

===Gippius in exile===
[[File:Gippius Filosofov Merezhkovsky.jpg|thumb|left|Gippius with Filosofov and Merezhkovsky (right) c. 1920]]
Their first destination was [[Minsk]] where Merezhkovsky and Gippius gave a series of lectures for Russian immigrants and published political pamphlets in the ''Minsk Courier''. During a stay of several months in [[Warsaw]] Gippius edited the ''Svoboda'' newspaper. Disillusioned with [[Jozef Pilsudski]]'s policies, the Merezhkovskys and Zlobin left for France on 20 October without Filosofov, who chose to stay in the city with Boris Savinkov.&lt;ref name="orlov"/&gt; In Paris Gippius concentrated on making appointments, sorting out mail, negotiating contracts and receiving guests. The Merezhkovsky's talks, as [[Nina Berberova]] remembered, always revolved around two major themes: Russia and freedom.&lt;ref name="evt"&gt;{{cite web | author = Yevtushenko, Evgeny | date = 2005-04-28 | url =http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/31n/n31n-s24.shtml | title = Dmitry Merezhkovsky. Between Sharikov and Antichrist | website= 2005.novayagazeta.ru | accessdate = 2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backing Merezhkovsky in his anti-Bolshevik crusade, she was deeply pessimistic as regards what her husband referred to as his 'mission'. "Our slavery is so unheard of and our revelations are so outlandish that for a free man it is difficult to understand what we are talking about," she conceded.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;

The tragedy of the exiled Russian writer became a major topic for Gippius in emigration, but she also continued to explore [[mystical]] and covertly sexual themes. She remained a harsh literary critic and, by dismissing many of the well-known writers of the Symbolist and [[Acmeist]] camps, made herself an unpopular figure in France.&lt;ref name="karlinsky"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Difficult Soul: Zinaida Gippius|chapter=Introduction|pages=1–21|publisher=University of California Press|year= 1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqBTqd2w9uUC|last=Karlinsky|first=Simon|author2=Vladimir Zlobin |isbn=0520038673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1920s several of Gippius's earlier works were re-issued in the West, including the collection of stories ''Heavenly Words'' (Небесные слова, 1921, Paris) and the ''Poems. 1911–1912 Diary'' (1922, Berlin). In [[Munich]] ''The Kingdom of Antichrist'' (Царство Антихриста), authored by Merezhkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov, and Zlobin, came out, including the first two parts of Gippius's ''Petersburg Diaries'' (Петербургские дневники). Gippius was the major force behind the ''Green Lamp'' (Зелёная лампа) society, named after the 19th century group associated with [[Alexander Pushkin]]. Fractional altercations aside, it proved to be the only cultural center where Russian émigré writers and philosophers (carefully chosen for each meeting and invited personally) could meet and discuss political and cultural topics.&lt;ref name="krugosvet"/&gt;

In 1928 the Merezhkovskys took part in the First Congress of Russian writers in exile held in [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.327&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged by the success of Merezhkovsky's [[Da Vinci]] series of lectures and [[Benito Mussolini]]'s benevolence, in 1933 the couple moved to [[Italy]] where they stayed for about three years, visiting Paris only occasionally. With the Socialist movement rising there and anti-Russian emigration feelings spurred by President [[Paul Doumer]]'s murder in 1932, France felt like a hostile place to them.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.329&lt;/ref&gt; Living in exile was very hard for Gippius psychologically. As one biographer put it, "her metaphysically grandiose personality, with its spiritual and intellectual overload, was out of place in what she herself saw as a 'soullessly pragmatic' period in European history."&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;

====The last years====
As the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe rendered literature virtually irrelevant, Gippius, against all odds, compiled and published the ''Literature Tornado'', an ambitious literary project set up to provide a safe haven for writers rejected by publishers for ideological reasons. What in other times might have been hailed as a powerful act in support of the freedom of speech, in 1939 passed unnoticed.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; Merezhkovsky and Gippius spent their last year together in a social vacuum.&lt;ref name="volk"&gt;{{cite web | author = Volkogonova, Olga | url= http://perfilov.narod.ru/ser_poetry/merez/philosofy.htm | title = The Religious Anarchism of D.Merezhkovsky | publisher = perfilov.narod.ru | accessdate = 2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of whether or not the 1944 text of Merezhkovsky's allegedly pro-Hitler "Radio speech" was indeed a prefabricated montage (as his biographer Zobnin asserted), there was little doubt that the couple, having become too close to (and financially dependent on) the Germans in Paris, had lost respect and credibility as far as their compatriots were concerned, many of whom expressed outright hatred toward them.&lt;ref name="wolf"/&gt;

Merezhkovsky's death in 1941 came as a heavy blow to Gippius. After the deaths of Dmitry Filosofov and her sister Anna (in 1940 and 1942 respectively) she found herself alone in the world and, as some sources suggest, contemplated suicide.&lt;ref name="wolf"&gt;{{cite web| author= Wolf, Vitaly| url= http://mylove.ru/arsmoriendi/diary/view/?id=48141| title= The Decadent Madonna| website= mylove.ru| accessdate= 2010-08-13| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110727085732/http://mylove.ru/arsmoriendi/diary/view/?id=48141| archivedate= 2011-07-27| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With her secretary [[Vladimir Zlobin]] still around, though, Gippius resorted to writing what she hoped would some day gel into the comprehensive life story of her late husband. As [[Nadezhda Teffi|Teffi]] remembered, 
{{quote| Gippius spent the last months of her life working, mostly at nights. Filling one journal after another with that fine calligraphic handwriting of hers, she was preparing a major book that was to become, as she saw it, a proper tribute to her lifetime companion, the one she referred to as 'the Great Man'. She praised this man in terms which were most unusual for her – a woman of icy sharp intellect whose view on people around her was so utterly ironic. She must have loved him very, very strongly.&lt;ref name="tff"&gt;{{cite web | author = Teffi| url=http://az.lib.ru/t/teffi/text_0150.shtml| title= Zinalida Gippius| publisher= az.lib.ru| accessdate = 2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gippius died on 9 September 1945. Her last written words were: "Low is my price.... And wise is God."&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; She was interred in [[Sainte-Genevieve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery]] with her husband. A small group of people attended the ceremony, among them [[Ivan Bunin]].&lt;ref name="cyr_mef"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wolf"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Z Gippius 1910s.jpg|thumb|right|Gippius in the early 1910s]]
Modern scholars see Gippius's romantically tinged early poems as mostly derivative, [[Semyon Nadson]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] being the two most obvious influences.&lt;ref name="rulex"/&gt; The publication of Dmitry Merezhkovky's symbolist manifesto proved to be a turning point: in a short time Gippius became a major figure of Russian Modernism. Her early symbolist prose carried the strong influence of [[Dostoyevsky]], while one of her later novels, ''Roman Tzarevich'' (1912), was said to be influenced again by Nietzsche. Gippius's first two short story collections, ''New People'' (1896) and ''Mirrors'' (1898), examining "the nature of beauty in all of its manifestations and contradictions," were seen as formulaic. Her ''Third Book of Short Stories'' (1902) marked a change of direction and was described as "sickly idiosyncratic" and full of "highbrow mysticism." Parallels have been drawn between Gippius's early 20th century prose and [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]]'s ''Meaning of Love'', both authors examining the 'quest for love' as the means for self-fulfillment of the human soul.&lt;ref name="sok"/&gt;

It was not prose but poetry that made Gippius a major innovative force. "Gippius the poet holds her own special place in Russian literature; her poems are deeply intellectual, immaculate in form, and genuinely exciting."&lt;ref name="rulex"/&gt; Critics praised her originality and technical virtuosity, claiming her to be a "true heir to [[Yevgeny Baratynsky]]'s muse".&lt;ref name="cyr_mef"/&gt;

Her ''[[Collection of Poems. 1889–1903]]'' became an important event in Russian cultural life. Having defined the world of poetry as a three-dimensional structure involving "Love and Eternity meeting in Death", she discovered and explored in it her own brand of ethic and aesthetic minimalism. Symbolist writers were the first to praise her 'hint and pause' metaphor technique, as well as the art of "extracting sonorous chords out of silent pianos," according to [[Innokenty Annensky]], who saw the book as the artistic peak of "Russia's 15 years of modernism" and argued that "not a single man would ever be able to dress abstractions in clothes of such charm [as this woman]." Men admired Gippius's outspokenness too: Gippius commented on her inner conflicts, full of 'demonic temptations' (inevitable for a poet whose mission was 'creating a new, true soul', as she put it), with unusual frankness.&lt;ref name="makarenko"/&gt;

The 1906 collection ''Scarlet Sword'', described as a study in the 'human soul's metaphysics' performed from the [[neo-Christian]] standpoint, propagated the idea of God and man as one single being. The author equated 'self-denial' with the sin of betraying God, and detractors suspected blasphemy in this egocentric stance. Sex and death themes, investigated in the obliquely impressionist manner formed the leitmotif of her next book of prose, ''Black on White'' (1908). The 20th century also saw the rise of Gippius the playwright (''Saintly Blood'', 1900, ''Poppie Blossom'', 1908). The most acclaimed of her plays, ''The Green Ring'' (1916), futuristic in plotline, if not in form, was successfully produced by [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] for the [[Alexandrinsky Theatre]].&lt;ref name="russianculture"/&gt; Anton Krainy, Gippius's alter ego, was a highly respected and somewhat feared literary critic whose articles regularly appeared in ''Novy Put'', ''Vesy'' and ''[[Russkaya Mysl]]''. Gippius's critical analysis, according to Brockhaus and Efron, was insightful, but occasionally too harsh and rarely objective.&lt;ref name="rulex"/&gt;
[[File:Дмитрий Мережковский и Зинаида Гиппиус.JPG|thumb|left|The grave of the Merezhkovskys at the [[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery]]]]
The 1910 ''[[Collection of Poems. Book 2. 1903-1909]]'' garnered good reviews; Bunin called Gippius's poetry 'electric', pointing at the peculiar use of [[oxymoron]] as an electrifying force in the author's hermetic, impassive world.&lt;ref name="krugosvet"/&gt; Some contemporaries found Gippius's works curiously unfeminine. [[Vladislav Khodasevich]] spoke of the conflict between her "poetic soul and non-poetic mind." "Everything is strong and spatial in her verse, there is little room for details. Her lively, sharp thought, dressed in emotional complexity, sort of rushes out of her poems, looking for spiritual wholesomeness and ideal harmony," modern scholar Vitaly Orlov said.&lt;ref name="orlov"/&gt;

Gippius's novels ''The Devil's Doll'' (1911) and ''Roman Tzarevich'' (1912), aiming to "lay bare the roots of Russian reactionary ideas," were unsuccessful: critics found them tendentious and artistically inferior. "In poetry Gippius is more original than in prose. Well constructed, full of intriguing ideas, never short of insight, her stories and novellas are always a bit too preposterous, stiff and uninspired, showing little knowledge of real life. Gippius's characters pronounce interesting words and find themselves in interestingly difficult situations but fail to turn into living people in the reader's mind. Serving as embodiments of ideas and concepts, they are genuinely crafted marionettes put into action by the author's hand, not by their own inner motives."&lt;ref name="rulex"/&gt;

The events of October 1917 led to Gippius severing all ties with most of those who admired her poetry, including Blok, Bryusov and Bely. The history of this schism and the reconstruction of the ideological collisions that made such a catastrophe possible became the subject matter of her memoirs ''The Living Faces'' (Живые лица, 1925). While Blok (the man whom she famously refused her hand in 1918) saw the Revolution as a 'purifying storm', Gippius was appalled by the 'suffocating dourness' of the whole thing, seeing it as one huge monstrosity "leaving one with just one wish: to go blind and deaf." Behind all this, for Gippius, there was a kind of 'monumental madness'; it was all the more important for her to keep a "healthy mind and strong memory," she explained.

After ''Last Poems'' (1918) Gippius published two more books of verse, ''Poems. 1911–1920 Diaries'' (1922) and ''The Shining Ones'' (1938). Her poetry, prose and essays published in emigration were utterly pessimistic; the 'rule of beastliness', the ruins of human culture, and the demise of civilization were her major themes. Most valuable for Gippius were her diaries: she saw these flash points of personal history as essential for helping future generations to restore the true course of events. Yet, as a modern Russian critic has put it, "Gippius's legacy, for all its inner drama and antinomy, its passionate, forceful longing for the unfathomable, has always borne the ray of hope, the fiery, unquenchable belief in a higher truth and the ultimate harmony crowning a person's destiny. As she herself wrote in one of her last poems, "Alas, now they are torn apart: the timelessness and all things human / But time will come and both will intertwine into one shimmering eternity'."&lt;ref name="sok"/&gt;
