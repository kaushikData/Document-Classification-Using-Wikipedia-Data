      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2376">The '''Acerinox accident''' was an incident of [[radioactive contamination]] in [[Cádiz]] ([[Spain]]). In May 1998, a [[caesium-137]] source managed to pass through the monitoring equipment in an [[Acerinox]] [[scrap metal]] reprocessing plant in [[Los Barrios]], Spain. When melted, the caesium-137 caused the release of a [[radioactive cloud]]. The Acerinox [[chimney]] detectors failed to detect it, but it was eventually detected in France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Austria. The [[radioactive]] levels measured were up to 1000 times higher than normal.

The accident contaminated the [[scrap metal]] reprocessing plant, plus two other steel mills where it sent its waste for decontamination. According to independent laboratories,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/495/4895.html WISE NC: CAESIUM-137 CONTAMINATION IN EUROPE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the ashes produced by the Acerinox factory had between 640 and 1420 [[becquerel]]s per gram (the [[European Atomic Energy Community|Euratom]] norm is 10 Bq/g), high enough to be a threat to the public. 

On the radiological consequences of this event, six people were exposed to slight levels of caesium-137 contamination. The estimated total costs for clean-up, waste storage, and lost production in the factory were around 26 million US dollars (most of it due to the lost production).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclearpolicy.info/publications/scrapmetal.php NFLA Radioactive scrap metal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321092450/http://www.nuclearpolicy.info/publications/scrapmetal.php |date=2007-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Amaranthus acanthochiton''''', the '''greenstripe''', is an annual plant species of the genus ''[[Amaranthus]]'' in the [[Amaranthaceae]] family. It is native to the southwestern [[United States]] ([[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Texas]], and [[Utah]]) and northern [[Mexico]] ([[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]), growing at elevations of 1000–2000 m where it is uncommon.

It is a dioecious plant growing to 10–80&amp;nbsp;cm tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] are slender, 2–8&amp;nbsp;cm long and 2–12&amp;nbsp;mm broad. The [[flower]]s are pale green, produced in dense terminal spikes. The [[seed]]s are brown, 1-1.3&amp;nbsp;mm diameter, contained in a 2-2.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[achene]].

It is critically endangered in Utah, and endangered in Arizona (though no status has been set).

The seeds and young leaves were used by the [[Hopi]] Indians as a food source.  The seeds were cooked as a form of porridge, while the leaves were used as greens.

'''Arsenic triselenide''' ([[Arsenic|As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[Selenium|Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is an [[inorganic]] [[chemical compound]], a [[selenide]] of [[arsenic]].

[[Amorphous]] arsenic triselenide is used as a [[chalcogenide glass]] for [[infrared]] [[optics]], as it transmits light with [[wavelength]]s between 870 nm and 17.2 µm [reference needed].

Arsenic triselenide is covalently bonded. Even so, the arsenic has a formal [[oxidation state]] of +3.
==Solution processed thin film As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;==

Thin film selenide glasses have emerged as an important material for integrated photonics due to its high refractive index, mid-IR transparency and high non-linear optical indices. High-quality As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; glass films can be deposited from spin coating method from ethylenediamine solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Yi Zou, Hongtao Lin, Okechukwu Ogbuu, Lan Li, Sylvain Danto, Spencer Novak, Jacklyn Novak, J.

The '''Awhitu Wind Farm''' is a [[renewable energy]] project in [[New Zealand]] initially planned by [[Tilt Renewables]]. The development is proposed to be located on the Awhitu Peninsula near [[Waiuku]] on the west coast south of [[Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Generation update – October 2013 |url=http://www.ea.govt.nz/dmsdocument/11455 |format=PDF |publisher=Electricity Authority |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=16 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416192143/http://www.ea.govt.nz/dmsdocument/11455 |archivedate=16 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016 the project was being privately pursued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Energy for the next generation |url=https://www.thepost.nz/articles/energy-for-the-next-generation/ |website=The Post New Zealand |date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The project was initially developed by [[Genesis Energy Limited|Genesis Energy]] with plans for up to 18 wind turbines with a capacity of up to 25 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windenergy.org.nz/nz-wind-farms/proposed-wind-farms/awhitu |title=Awhitu |publisher=NZ Wind Energy Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026200402/http://windenergy.org.nz/nz-wind-farms/proposed-wind-farms/awhitu |archivedate=2012-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maximum height to the tip of the blades was 90m.

In 2004, the wind farm received carbon credits from the New Zealand government,&lt;ref name="beehive"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/extended+wind+farm+wins+carbon+credits| title=Extended wind farm wins carbon credits| date=23 February 2004| first=Harry| last=Duynhoven| publisher=NZ Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; under a scheme to promote [[renewable energy]] for electricity generation.  However, local councils denied the application for [[resource consent]]s.  This project was notable in being one of the few power projects to be denied resource consents.

Genesis Energy appealed to the [[Environment Court]], which, in 2005, granted the resource consents until the year 2015, overturning the decision of the local councils. Genesis subsequently sold development rights to a landowner, who approached Trustpower to progress the project.&lt;ref name="ENews"&gt;{{cite news|title=TrustPower may build 15MW Awhitu wind farm this year| date=18 June 2012| publisher=Energy News| first=Edward| last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Tilt Renewables]] demerged from Trustpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.trustpower.co.nz/company-and-investor-information/demerger| title=Demerger| publisher=Trustpower| date=1 November 2016| accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016 the project was being pursued by private development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Construction has begun |url=https://www.thepost.nz/articles/construction-has-begun/ |website=The Post New Zealand |date=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biomass Energy Centre''' is a [[biomass]] fired [[Cogeneration|CHP]] power station located in the town of [[Chilton, County Durham|Chilton]] in [[County Durham]]. Opened in 2011, the plant was developed, and then owned and operated by [[Veolia Energy-Dalkia]].

==Development==
In May 2009, [[Veolia Energy-Dalkia]], who had a base in nearby [[Cramlington]], [[Northumberland]] and had previously provided [[cogeneration]] (CHP) plants for the [[Newcastle General Hospital|Newcastle General]], [[Freeman Hospital|Freeman]] and [[Royal Victoria Infirmary]] hospitals in Newcastle, announced their plans to build a biomass fueled CHP power station in the County Durham town of Chilton. The site chosen had previously been occupied by a [[feed mill]] and [[silo]], which had been highly visible throughout the town and had come to  be known locally as ''Chilton Cathedral''. The new plant was expected to cost £40&amp;nbsp;million, half of which was to be spent within the [[North East England|North East]] region, on materials and components for the plant, aiding the local economy.&lt;ref name=hopes&gt;{{cite web
|url         = http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2009/05/20/dalkia-power-plant-scheme-fuels-hopes-for-chilton-61634-23666737/

|accessdate  = 19 August 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chilton Town Council voted unanimously in support of the plant, saying it would be a catalyst for the regeneration of the area, and this was supported by a 340 name [[petition]] from the local people.&lt;ref name=hopes /&gt; Planning permission was granted later that June and construction commenced in January 2010.&lt;ref name=near&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 50 jobs were created during the construction of the plant, with 17 permanent jobs created following completion.&lt;ref name=hopes /&gt; Commissioning of the plant began in June 2011, taking three to four weeks to complete.&lt;ref name=near /&gt;

==Operations==
115,000 to 120,000 tonnes of wood are burned in the station per year, providing electricity for up to 20,000 homes through the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]]. The plant is one of the first in the UK to burn domestic waste wood to provide electricity for the National Grid, rather than for an industrial site. It is the first of a number of similar sites which Dalkia are planning in the UK.&lt;ref name=near /&gt;

The [[feedstock]] for the plant is wood which has reached the end of its useful life such as old [[shipping pallet]]s, manufacturing offcuts, wood from the construction and demolition industries, and material from [[civic amenity site]]s. This wood is collected through a network set up by Dalkia&lt;ref name=near /&gt; The fuel would other wise be sent to [[landfill]].&lt;ref name=hopes /&gt;

50,000 tonnes of [[wood pellet]]s are produced on site each year, for use elsewhere.&lt;ref name=hopes /&gt;

==Design and specification==
The plant has a generating capacity of 17.5 [[megawatt]]s.&lt;ref name=near /&gt;

'''''Blood in the Mobile''''' is a 2010 [[documentary film]] by [[Danish people|Danish]] film director [[Frank Piasecki Poulsen]]. The film addresses the issue of [[conflict minerals]] by examining illegal [[cassiterite]] mining in the [[North Kivu|North-Kivu]] province in eastern [[DR Congo]].  In particular, it focuses on the cassiterite mine in [[Bisie]].&lt;ref name="guardian film-maker uncovers blood in the mobile"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/oct/10/blood-in-the-mobile-congo | title=A shocking connection: film-maker uncovers Blood in the Mobile | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=2011-10-10 | accessdate=October 11, 2011 | author=Applebaum, Stephen | location=London | quote=Poulsen arranged a research trip to Congo and successfully secured entry to the Bisie mine, located deep in the jungles of Walikale, where thousands of people, many of them children, were living and working in hellish conditions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is co-financed by Danish, German, Finnish, Hungarian and Irish television, as well as the Danish National film board.

The film premiered in Denmark on September 1, 2010. During the making of the film Frank Piasecki Poulsen is working with communications professional and [[new media]] entrepreneur [[Mikkel Skov Petersen]] on the online [[advertising campaign|campaign]] of the same name.

The campaign is addressing Poulsen and Petersens notion of the responsibility of the manufacturers of [[mobile phone]]s on the situation in war torn eastern Congo. The project is collaborating with [[NGO]]s like Dutch-based [[Make It Fair]] and British-based [[Global Witness]] who are also engaged in changing the conduct of Western companies regarding the industrial use of minerals of unknown origin.

The cassiterite dug out in the illegal mines in North-Kivu is according to Danish corporate monitor organization Danwatch &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.danwatch.dk/en/undersogelse/maersk-og-det-farlige-affald-i-bangladesh/ The Danwatch report: Bad Connections]&lt;/ref&gt; primarily purchased as [[tin]] by the electronics industry after processing in East Asia.

Apart from trying to raise awareness of the issue of [[illegal mining]] and alleged lack of [[corporate social responsibility]] from the [[mobile phone industry]], the campaign is an attempt to experiment with new ways of building an audience and create additional funding for documentary films.

The production of the film and the campaign is run in association with Danish new media company [[Spacesheep]], founded in 2009 by Poulsen and Petersen in association with major Danish independent TV and film production company [[Koncern]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1629">The '''Centre for Environmental Studies''' (CES) was an environmental think-tank in the United Kingdom. It was established in 1967 by the second [[Centre for Environmental Studies|Wilson government]] as an independent charitable trust for the purpose of advancing education and research in the planning and design of the physical environment. It began with $750,000 funding from the [[Ford Foundation]] and grants from the British government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Centre for Environmental Studies|work=[[Hansard]] HC Deb 21 February 1967 vol 741 cc244-6W|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1967/feb/21/centre-for-environmental-studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first director was [[Henry Chilver, Baron Chilver|A. H. Chilver]], Professor of Civil Engineering in the University of London. The centre began to assess the needs for research in planning the environment for human living, and to consider how and where this research could most effectively be undertaken.

Funding for the centre was withdrawn by the [[First Thatcher ministry|Thatcher government]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Centre for Environmental Studies|work=Hansard HC Deb 25 October 1979 vol 972 cc287-8W| url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1979/oct/25/centre-for-environmental-studies#S5CV0972P0_19791025_CWA_253}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre continued for some years as an independent body, closing in the 1980s.

'''Chlorotrifluorosilane''' is an organic gaseous compound with formula SiClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; composed of silicon, fluorine and chlorine.

==Production==
By heating a mixture of anhydrous [[aluminium chloride]] and [[sodium hexafluorosilicate]] to between 190 and 250°C a mixture of gases containing chlorotrifluorosilane is given off.  These are condensed at -196°C degrees and fractionally distilled at temperatures up to -78°C.&lt;ref name=scmmei52&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmeißer und Herber t Jenkne r|first1=Martin|last2=Jenkner|first2=Herbert|title=Zurr Kenntnis anorganischer Säurefluoride (i) Über Reaktione n des Siliciumtetrafluorids (bzw. des Natriumsilicofluorids )|journal=Verlag Zeitschrift für Naturforschung|date=1952|pages=191–192|url=http://zfn.mpdl.mpg.de/data/Reihe_B/7/ZNB-1952-7b-0191_n.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SiClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be made by reacting [[silicon tetrachloride]] and [[silicon tetrafluoride]] gases at 600°C, producing a mixture of fluorochloro silanes including about one quarter SiClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent

The '''Dark Matter Time Projection Chamber (DMTPC)''' is an experiment for direct detection of [[weakly interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs), one of the most favored candidates for [[dark matter]]. The experiment uses a low-pressure [[time projection chamber]] in order to extract the original direction of potential dark matter events. The collaboration includes physicists from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), [[Boston University]] (BU), and [[Brandeis University]].  Several prototype detectors have been built and tested in laboratories at MIT and BU. The group took its first data in an underground laboratory at the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant]] (WIPP) site near [[Carlsbad, New Mexico]] in Fall, 2010.

==Detector Concept==

The DMTPC detector consists of a TPC filled with low pressure [[Tetrafluoromethane|CF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] gas.   Charged particles incident on the gas are slowed and eventually stopped, leaving a trail of free electrons and [[ionization|ionized]] molecules.  The electrons are drifted by an electric field toward an amplification region.  Instead of using [[Multiwire proportional chamber|MWPC]] endplates for amplification and event readout, as in the traditional TPC design, the DMTPC amplification region consists of a metal wire mesh separated from a copper anode with a high electric field between them.  This creates a more uniform electric field in order to preserve the shape of the original track during amplification.  The [[Townsend avalanche|avalanche]] of electrons also creates a great deal of [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] light, which passes through the wire mesh.  Some of this light is collected by a [[charge coupled device|CCD]] camera located outside the main detector volume.  This results in a two dimensional image of the ionization signal of the track as it appeared on the amplification plane.  Information about the charged particle, including its direction of motion within the detector, can be reconstructed from the CCD readout.  Additional track information is obtained from readout of the charge signal on the anode plane.
The largest existing prototype detectors each have a total of 20 L of CF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; gas within the drift region, where measurable events will occur.  The group also plans to eventually construct a detector with a volume of 1 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Detection of WIMPs==
In a proposed dark matter event, a WIMP enters the detector volume and interacts with one of the atoms in the CF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, typically [[fluorine]].  While the WIMP does not directly leave a track, the momentum transfer of the interaction causes the atom to recoil, and its ionization track, with a typical range of a few millimeters, may be detected.  CF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; gas is used because the most common fluorine isotope, &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F, is believed to be an excellent target nucleus for setting [[Spin (physics)|spin]]-dependent WIMP-[[nucleon]] scattering.  If the recoiling ion is energetic enough, the direction of the incoming WIMP may be extrapolated from the direction of the recoil.

Because of the motion of the solar system around the center of the galaxy, many physicists believe that the particles comprising the [[dark matter halo]] will appear to originate from a particular direction in the sky roughly corresponding to the position of the constellation [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]].  If this is true, the DMTPC group hope to be able to use the directional track information to statistically confirm the existence of dark matter, even in the presence of non-dark matter backgrounds which are believed to have a different directional signal.  Several other groups developing low pressure TPC dark matter detectors with directional sensitivity exist, including [[Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks|DRIFT]], NEWAGE, and MIMAC.  Additionally, dark matter searches such as COUPP and NEWAGE also use fluorine as the principal target nucleus for spin-dependent interactions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7126">'''Elemental analysis''' is a process where a sample of some material (e.g., soil, waste or drinking water, bodily fluids, [[minerals]], [[chemical compound]]s) is analyzed for its [[chemical element|elemental]] and sometimes [[isotope|isotopic]] composition. Elemental analysis can be qualitative (determining what elements are present), and it can be quantitative (determining how much of each are present). Elemental analysis falls within the ambit of [[analytical chemistry]], the set of instruments involved in deciphering the chemical nature of our world.

For organic chemists, elemental analysis or "EA" almost always refers to CHNX analysis—the determination of the [[mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fractions]] of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[heteroatom]]s (X) (halogens, sulfur) of a sample. This information is very important to help determine the structure of an unknown compound, as well as to help ascertain the structure and purity of a synthesized compound.  In present day organic chemistry spectroscopic technics (like [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]], both &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C), [[mass spectrometry]] and [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] procedures  have replaced EA as the primary technique for structural determination, although it still gives very useful complementary information. It is also the fastest and most inexpensive method to determine sample purity.

[[Antoine Lavoisier]] is regarded as the inventor of elemental analysis as a quantitate, experimental tool to assess the chemical composition of a compound. At the time elemental analysis was based on gravimetric determination of specific adsorbant materials before and after selective adsorption of the combustion gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quantitative Micro-Analysis of Organic Substances|last=Pregl|first=Fritz|publisher=Springer|year=1917|isbn=978-3-86444-914-7|location=Berlin|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1923/pregl-lecture.html|title=Fritz Pregl - Nobel Lecture: Quantitative Micro-Analysis of Organic Substances|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today fully automated systems based on [[thermal conductivity]] or [[infrared spectroscopy]] detection of the combustion gases, or other spectroscopic methods are used.

==Methods==
[[File:Elementar modern elemental analyzer 2011.jpg|thumb|Modern simultaneous CHNS combustion analyzer]]
The most common form of elemental analysis, CHNS analysis, is accomplished by [[combustion analysis]]. In this technique, a sample is burned in an excess of oxygen and various traps, collecting the combustion products: carbon dioxide, water, and nitric oxide. The masses of these combustion products can be used to calculate the composition of the unknown sample. Modern elemental analyzers are also capable of simultaneous determination of [[sulfur]] along with CHN in the same measurement run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cmc.chem.au.dk/facilities/elemental-analysis|title=Aarhus University: Elemental Analysis Facility|last=|first=|date=3 July 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isotope.uottawa.ca/techniques/quantitative-analysis.html|title=G.G.

===Quantitative===
Quantitative analysis is the determination of the mass of each element or compound present.&lt;ref&gt;From Columbia Encyclopedia on answers.com: http://www.answers.com/library/Columbia+Encyclopedia-cid-2284496: chemical analysis&lt;/ref&gt; Other quantitative methods include:
*[[Gravimetric analysis|Gravimetry]], where the sample is dissolved and then the element of interest is precipitated and its mass measured or the element of interest is volatilized and the mass loss is measured.
*Optical [[atomic spectroscopy]], such as [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy|flame atomic absorption]], [[graphite furnace atomic absorption]], and [[inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy]], which probe the outer electronic structure of atoms.
* [[Neutron activation analysis]], which involves the activation of a sample matrix through the process of [[neutron capture]]. The resulting radioactive target nuclei of the sample begin to decay, emitting gamma rays of specific energies that identify the radioisotopes present in the sample. The concentration of each analyte can be determined by comparison to an irradiated standard with known concentrations of each analyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neutron Activation Analysis|url=http://www.acg.missouri.edu/NAA.html|publisher=Analytical Chemistry Group|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualitative===
To qualitatively determine which elements exist in a sample, the methods are:
* Mass spectrometric [[atomic spectroscopy]], such as [[inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]], which probes the mass of atoms.
* Other spectroscopy which probes the inner electronic structure of atoms such as [[X-ray fluorescence]], [[particle-induced X-ray emission]], [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]], and [[Auger electron spectroscopy]].
* Chemical methods
** [[Sodium fusion test]]
** [[Schöniger oxidation]]

===Analysis of results===

The analysis of results is performed by determining the ratio of elements from within the sample, and working out a [[chemical formula]] that fits with those results.  This process is useful as it helps determine if a sample sent is a desired compound and confirms the purity of a compound.  The accepted deviation of elemental analysis results from the calculated is 0.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/pharmacy/facilities/research-services/chn-elemental-microanalysis|title=CHN Elemental Microanalysis|website=www.ucl.ac.ke|language=en|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EECB Colour Med Res.png|thumbnail|The EECB project was established in November 2013 with a duration of 4 years]]

Funded by the [[Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation]]’s (SDC) Global Programme Climate Change, and implemented by [[Swisscontact]], the '''Energy Efficient Clay Brick project (EECB)''' aims at increasing energy efficiency and reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emission in the South African clay brick sector. The project represents phase II of the 4 year Vertical Shaft Brick Kiln (VSBK) project and was launched in November 2013 with a duration of another 4 years.

==About the Project==
The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) funded “Energy Efficient Clay Brick (EECB)” Project aims to foster sustained and broad-based [[Efficient energy use|Energy Efficiency]] (EnE) in the Clay Brick Sector, by targeting the entire market system. 
Based on this market system approach, the EECB Project – which has evolved from and forms the second phase of the Vertical Shaft Brick Kiln Project (2009 – 2013) – invests in a diverse set of stakeholders within the Clay Brick Sector of [[South Africa]], by supporting and capacitating clay brick makers and industry service providers in adopting a systematic approach to energy management. The Project not only contributes to technology transfer, but also addresses sector constraints within the enabling environment as well as the demand levels of the clay brick market system.

==Project Objectives==
The overall objective of the EECB Project &lt;ref&gt;http://www.swisscontact.org/en/south-africa/projects/projects/p/Project/show/energieeffiziente-backsteinproduktion-in-suedafrika.html&lt;/ref&gt; is to facilitate EnE within the Clay Brick Sector, reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and thereby contributing towards the country’s overall targets in increasing EnE and lowering [[carbon emissions]]. By October 2017, the EECB Project expects to reach 50 producers who reduce their CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 320,000 tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; annually and reach a 10 percent reduction in overall input energy.

On the supply side, the project engages actively with [[clay]] [[brick]] producers and related service providers, equipping them with the necessary capacity and knowledge needed to shift to more energy efficient production practices including the Vertical Shaft Brick Kiln (VSBK) and Habla Zig Zag Kiln (HZZK) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hablakilns.com/&lt;/ref&gt; technologies. With regards to a more enabling environment, EECB facilitates a close cooperation between private and public stakeholders and facilitates the access to specific financial products and funding schemes.

On the demand side of the bricks sub-sector, the project promotes the use of energy efficient clay brick among the building sector in an effort to grow market share and create a pull effect for the main drivers of change - the buyers.

==Achievements==
Since its implementation in November 2013, the EECB has gained recognition amongst the South African Clay Brick Sector through its close partnership with the South African Clay Brick Association &lt;ref&gt;http://www.claybrick.org&lt;/ref&gt; (CBA) as well as the Energy Efficiency Sector.

'''Notable Successes'''

* The successful transfer of the VSBK technology to the South African Clay Brick Makers
* total reduction of 7.200tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year by mid 2015 since 2013
* Completed construction of 24 VSBK shafts and an additional 22 shafts to be constructed in 2016
* 88% of brick makers have sought out energy efficient measures since the projects inception 
* An increasing number of brick makers are conducting energy audits
* Establishment of the Clay Brick Sector Energy Guidelines and Best Practices with the assistance of [[Carbon Trust]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1705">'''Equivalence of direct radiation''' (EDR) is a standardized comparison method for estimating the output ability of space-heating [[radiator]]s and [[convector heater|convectors]].

Measured in square feet, the reference standard for EDR is the mattress radiator&lt;ref &gt;http://www.heatinghelp.com/newsletter.cfm?Id=157 mattress radiator&lt;/ref&gt; invented by Stephen J. Gold in the mid 19th century.

One square foot of EDR is able to liberate 240 [[BTU]] per hour when surrounded by {{convert|70|°F|°C|abbr=on}} air and filled with [[steam]] of approximately {{convert|215|°F|°C|abbr=on}} temperature and 1 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]] of pressure.

EDR was originally a measure of the actual surface area of radiators.  As radiator (and later convector) design became more complicated and compact, the relationship of actual surface area to EDR became arbitrary. Laboratory methods based on the [[condensation]] of steam allowed for very accurate measurements.

While now somewhat archaic, EDR is still computed and used for sizing steam [[boiler]]s and [[radiator (heating)|radiators]], and for modifying and troubleshooting older heating systems using steam or hot water.

Geitonogamy is when pollen is exported using a vector (pollinator or wind) out of one flower but only to another flower on the same plant. It is a form of self-fertilization.

In [[flowering plant]]s, [[pollen]] is transferred from a [[flower]] to another flower on the same plant, and in animal pollinated systems this is accomplished by a pollinator visiting multiple flowers on the same plant. Geitonogamy is also possible within species that are [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]], and may actually be a quite common source of self-fertilized seeds in [[Self-incompatibility in plants#Self-compatibility (SC)|self-compatible]] species.&lt;ref name="Friedman2009"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=J. | title=The consequences of monoecy and protogyny for mating in wind-pollinated ''Carex'' | last2=Barrett | first2=S.C.H. | journal=New Phytologist |date=January 2009  | volume=181 | issue=2 | pages=489–497 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2008.02664.x | last1=Friedman | pmid=19121043}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also occurs in [[monoecious]] [[gymnosperm]]s.&lt;ref name="Williams2009"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=4ew2xYN8vVUC | title=Conifer Reproductive Biology | publisher=Springer | author=Williams, C.G. | year=2009 | location=New York | isbn=9781402096013 | oclc=405547163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although geitonogamy is functionally cross-pollination involving a pollinating agent, genetically it is similar to [[autogamy]] since the pollen grains come from the same plant.

Monoecious plants like [[maize]] show geitonogamy. Geitonogamy is not possible for strictly [[dioecious]] plants.

[[Image:Gogu Constantinescu bridge 2.jpg|thumb|Concrete bridge in [[Carol Park]], [[Bucharest]], designed by G. Constantinescu and dedicated in 1906. It was the first concrete bridge with straight beams in Romania.]]

'''George "Gogu" Constantinescu''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈd͡ʒe̯ord͡ʒe konstantiˈnesku|-|Ro-George Constantinescu.ogg}}, first name's diminutive is '''Gogu''', last name also '''Constantinesco'''; 4 October 1881 – 11 December 1965) was a [[Romania]]n [[scientist]], [[engineer]] and [[inventor]]. During his career, he registered over 130 inventions. He is the creator of the ''[[theory of sonics]]'', a new branch of [[continuum mechanics]], in which he described the transmission of mechanical [[energy]] through [[oscillation|vibration]]s.

Born in [[Craiova]] in "the Doctor's House" near  the Mihai Bravu Gardens, he was influenced by his father George, born in 1844 (a professor of  mathematics and engineering science, specialized in  mathematics at the Sorbonne University).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fluid.power.net/fpn/const/const001.html |title=Early Days in Romania – the Conception of Sonics |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=20 March 2002 |accessdate=23 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020320151830/http://fluid.power.net/fpn/const/const001.html |archivedate=20 March 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gogu Constantinescu settled in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1912. He was an honorary [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]].

==Family==
He married Alexandra (Sandra) Cocorescu in [[Richmond, London]], in December 1914. The couple moved to [[Wembley]] and, after their son Ian was born, they moved to [[Weybridge]].&lt;ref name="archive2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fluid.power.net/fpn/const/const002.html |title=England – Birth of Sonics |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=20 March 2002 |accessdate=24 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020320163410/http://fluid.power.net/fpn/const/const002.html |archivedate=20 March 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage broke down in the 1920s and ended in divorce. He then married Eva Litton and the couple moved to Oxen House, beside [[Coniston Water|Lake Coniston]]. Eva had two children, Richard and Michael, by a previous marriage.&lt;ref name="archive1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fluid.power.net/fpn/const/const005.html |title=The Torque Converter |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=24 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021104140156/http://fluid.power.net/fpn/const/const005.html |archivedate=4 November 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventions and designs==
===Synchronization gear===
His [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] machine gun [[synchronization gear]] allowed airplane-mounted guns to shoot between the spinning blades of the propeller. The [[Constantinesco synchronization gear]] (or ''"CC" gear'') was first used operationally on the [[Airco DH.4|D.H.4]]s of No. [[No. 55 Squadron RAF|55 squadron R.F.C.]] from March 1917, during [[World War I]], and rapidly became standard equipment, replacing a variety of mechanical gears. It continued to be used by the [[Royal Air Force]] until [[World War II]] – the [[Gloster Gladiator]] being the last British fighter to be equipped with "CC" gear.

===Sonics===
In 1918, he published the book ''A treatise on transmission of power by vibrations''&lt;ref&gt;Constantinesco, G. ''Theory of Sonics: A Treatise on Transmission of Power by Vibrations''. The Admiralty, London, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he described his [[Theory of sonics]].  The theory is applicable to various systems of power transmission but has mostly been applied to hydraulic systems.  Sonics differs from [[hydrostatics]], being based on waves, rather than pressure, in the liquid. Constantinescu argued that, contrary to popular belief, liquids are compressible.&lt;ref&gt;See [[compressibility]] which lists compressibilities for water and some other liquids&lt;/ref&gt; Transmission of power by [[wave]]s in a liquid (e.g. water or oil) required a generator to produce the waves and a motor to use the waves to do work, either by percussion (as in [[Drifter (drill)|rock drills]]) or by conversion to rotary motion.&lt;ref name="archive2002"/&gt;

===Internal combustion engines===
He had several patents for improvements to [[carburetor]]s, for example US1206512.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=US&amp;NR=1206512A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=19161128&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_gb |title=Espacenet – Original document |publisher=Worldwide.espacenet.com |date=28 November 1916 |accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also devised a hydraulic system (patent  GB133719) for operating both the valves and the fuel injectors for [[diesel engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?DB=worldwide.espacenet.com&amp;II=0&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=&amp;CC=GB&amp;NR=133719A&amp;KC=A |title=Espacenet – Bibliographic data |publisher=Worldwide.espacenet.com |date=21 March 1918 |accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torque converter===
[[File:Constantinesco Car.jpg|thumb|left|Constantinesco automobile advertisement]]

He invented a mechanical [[torque converter]] actuated by a [[pendulum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Nelson |url=http://www.rexresearch.com/constran/1constran.htm |title=George Constantinesco: Inertial Transmission (US Patent 1591471 etc) |publisher=Rexresearch.com |date= |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was applied to the ''[[Constantinesco (automobile)|Constantinesco]]'', a [[France|French]]-manufactured car. It was also tried on rail vehicles. A 250 hp [[petrol engine]]d locomotive with a Constantinescu torque converter was exhibited at the 1924 [[Wembley Exhibition]]. The system was not
adopted on British railways but it was applied to some railcars on the Romanian State Railways.&lt;ref name="archive1"/&gt;

[[File:Lainici Bridge.jpg|thumb|One of the two Lainici bridges designed by Constantinescu]]  

===Other===
Other inventions included a "railway motor wagon". The latter ran on normal [[Train wheel|flanged steel wheels]] but the drive used a road vehicle [[powertrain]] with rubber tyres pressed against the rails. This is similar to the system used on many modern [[road-rail vehicle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=US&amp;NR=2016626A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=19351008&amp;DB=&amp;locale=en_GB |title=Espacenet – Original document |publisher=Worldwide.espacenet.com |date=8 October 1935 |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also designed the [[Constanţa Mosque]] (a project completed by the architect Victor Ştefănescu).

===Recent developments===
Research on a ''sonic asynchronous motor for vehicle applications'' (based on Constantinescu's work) has been done at the [[Transilvania University of Brașov]]. The date of the paper is believed to be 5 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Radu et al.

==Death==
He died at Oxen House, beside [[Coniston Water]] on 11/12 December 1965,&lt;ref&gt;Records differ on exact date&lt;/ref&gt; and is buried in the churchyard at [[Lowick, Cumbria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fluid.power.net/fpn/const/const007.html |title=Laboratory at Coniston |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=24 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030401084217/http://fluid.power.net/fpn/const/const007.html |archivedate=1 April 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hydrogen''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''H''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;1. With a [[standard atomic weight]] of {{val|1.008}}, hydrogen is the lightest element on the [[periodic table]]. Its [[monatomic]] form (H) is the [[abundance of the chemical elements|most abundant]] chemical substance in the [[Universe]], constituting roughly 75% of all [[baryon]]ic mass.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;However, most of the universe's mass is not in the form of baryons or chemical elements. See [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].&lt;/ref&gt; Non-[[stellar remnant|remnant]] [[star]]s are mainly composed of hydrogen in the [[plasma state]]. The most common [[isotope]] of hydrogen, termed ''protium'' (name rarely used, symbol &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H), has one [[proton]] and no [[neutron]]s.

The universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination epoch]]. At [[standard temperature and pressure]], hydrogen is a [[Transparency (optics)|colorless]], [[odorless]], [[taste]]less, non-toxic, [[nonmetal]]lic, highly [[combustion|combustible]] [[Diatomic molecule|diatomic]] [[gas]] with the [[molecular formula]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Since hydrogen readily forms [[covalent bond|covalent]] compounds with most nonmetallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in [[Molecular geometry|molecular forms]] such as [[water]] or [[organic compound]]s. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in [[acid–base reaction]]s because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In [[ionic compound]]s, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., [[anion]]) when it is known as a [[hydride]], or as a positively charged (i.e., [[cation]]) [[chemical species|species]] denoted by the symbol H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex. As the only neutral atom for which the [[Schrödinger equation]] can be solved analytically,&lt;ref name=Laursen04&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laursen|first1=S.|last2=Chang|first2=J.|last3=Medlin|first3=W.|last4=Gürmen|first4=N.|last5=Fogler|first5=H.

Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids on metals. In 1766–81, [[Henry Cavendish]] was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance,&lt;ref&gt;

The detection of a burning hydrogen leak may require a [[flame detector]]; such leaks can be very dangerous. Hydrogen flames in other conditions are blue, resembling blue natural gas flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Visible emission of hydrogen flames |last1=Schefer|first1=E.

The [[Hindenburg disaster|destruction of the Hindenburg airship]] was a notorious example of hydrogen combustion and the cause is still debated. The visible orange flames in that incident were the result of a rich mixture of hydrogen to oxygen combined with carbon compounds from the airship skin.

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with every oxidizing element.

===Electron energy levels===

The [[ground state]] [[energy level]] of the electron in a hydrogen atom is −13.6&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|eV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=NAAP Labs|title=Energy Levels|url=http://astro.unl.edu/naap/hydrogen/levels.html|publisher=University of Nebraska Lincoln|accessdate=20 May 2015|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is equivalent to an ultraviolet [[photon]] of roughly 91&amp;nbsp;[[metre|nm]] wavelength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=photon+wavelength+13.6+ev
|title=photon wavelength 13.6 eV|accessdate=20 May 2015|date=20 May 2015|work=Wolfram Alpha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the [[Bohr model]] of the atom, which conceptualizes the electron as "orbiting" the proton in analogy to the Earth's orbit of the Sun. However, the atomic electron and proton are held together by [[electromagnetic force]], while planets and celestial objects are held by [[gravity]]. Because of the discretization of [[angular momentum]] postulated in early [[quantum mechanics]] by Bohr, the electron in the Bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton, and therefore only certain allowed energies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A more accurate description of the hydrogen atom comes from a purely quantum mechanical treatment that uses the [[Schrödinger equation]], [[Dirac equation]] or even the [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] [[path integral formulation]] to calculate the [[probability amplitude|probability density]] of the electron around the proton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Stern|first=D. P.|date=13 February 2005| url=http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Q7.htm| title=Wave Mechanics| publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center| accessdate=16 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most complicated treatments allow for the small effects of [[special relativity]] and [[vacuum polarization]]. In the quantum mechanical treatment, the electron in a ground state hydrogen atom has no angular momentum at all—illustrating how the "planetary orbit" differs from electron motion.

At very low temperatures, the equilibrium state is composed almost exclusively of the para form. The liquid and gas phase thermal properties of pure parahydrogen differ significantly from those of the normal form because of differences in rotational heat capacities, as discussed more fully in ''[[spin isomers of hydrogen]]''.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hritz|first=J.|date=March 2006|url=http://smad-ext.grc.nasa.gov/gso/manual/chapter_06.pdf|format=PDF|title=CH. 6&amp;nbsp;– Hydrogen|work=NASA Glenn Research Center Glenn Safety Manual, Document GRC-MQSA.001|publisher=NASA|accessdate=5 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ortho/para distinction also occurs in other hydrogen-containing molecules or functional groups, such as water and [[methylene group|methylene]], but is of little significance for their thermal properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Shinitzky| first1=M.| last2=Elitzur| first2=A.

The uncatalyzed interconversion between para and ortho H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases with increasing temperature; thus rapidly condensed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contains large quantities of the high-energy ortho form that converts to the para form very slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milenko|first=Yu.

|accessdate=23 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By some definitions, "organic" compounds are only required to contain carbon. However, most of them also contain hydrogen, and because it is the carbon-hydrogen bond which gives this class of compounds most of its particular chemical characteristics, carbon-hydrogen bonds are required in some definitions of the word "organic" in chemistry.&lt;ref name="hydrocarbon" /&gt; Millions of [[hydrocarbon]]s are known, and they are usually formed by complicated synthetic pathways that seldom involve elementary hydrogen.

====Hydrides====
{{Main|Hydride}}
Compounds of hydrogen are often called [[hydride]]s, a term that is used fairly loosely. The term "hydride" suggests that the H atom has acquired a negative or anionic character, denoted H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more [[electropositive]] element. The existence of the [[hydride|hydride anion]], suggested by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1916 for group 1 and 2 salt-like hydrides, was demonstrated by Moers in 1920 by the electrolysis of molten [[lithium hydride]] (LiH), producing a [[stoichiometric|stoichiometry]] quantity of hydrogen at the anode.&lt;ref name="Moers"&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Moers|first=K.
|title=Investigations on the Salt Character of Lithium Hydride
|journal=Zeitschrift für Anorganische und Allgemeine Chemie
|date=1920|volume=113|issue=191|pages=179–228|doi=10.1002/zaac.19201130116
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For hydrides other than group 1 and 2 metals, the term is quite misleading, considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen. An exception in group 2 hydrides is {{chem|BeH|2}}, which is polymeric. In [[lithium aluminium hydride]], the {{chem|AlH|4|-}} anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the Al(III).

Although hydrides can be formed with almost all main-group elements, the number and combination of possible compounds varies widely; for example, more than 100 binary borane hydrides are known, but only one binary aluminium hydride.&lt;ref name="Downs"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Binary [[indium]] hydride has not yet been identified, although larger complexes exist.&lt;ref name="Hibbs"&gt;{{cite journal

|journal=Chemical Communications
|date=1999|pages=185–186|doi=10.1039/a809279f
|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[inorganic chemistry]], hydrides can also serve as [[bridging ligand]]s that link two metal centers in a [[coordination complex]]. This function is particularly common in [[group 13 element]]s, especially in [[borane]]s ([[boron]] hydrides) and [[aluminium]] complexes, as well as in clustered [[carborane]]s.&lt;ref name="Miessler" /&gt;

====Protons and acids====
{{Further|Acid–base reaction}}
Oxidation of hydrogen removes its electron and gives [[Hydrogen ion|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], which contains no electrons and a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] which is usually composed of one proton. That is why {{chem|H|+}} is often called a proton. This species is central to discussion of [[acid]]s. Under the [[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory]], acids are proton donors, while bases are proton acceptors.

A bare proton, {{chem|H|+}}, cannot exist in solution or in ionic crystals because of its unstoppable attraction to other atoms or molecules with electrons. Except at the high temperatures associated with plasmas, such protons cannot be removed from the [[electron cloud]]s of atoms and molecules, and will remain attached to them. However, the term 'proton' is sometimes used loosely and metaphorically to refer to positively charged or [[cation]]ic hydrogen attached to other species in this fashion, and as such is denoted "{{chem|H|+}}" without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a species.

To avoid the implication of the naked "solvated proton" in solution, acidic aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain a less unlikely fictitious species, termed the "[[hydronium]] ion" ({{chem|H|3|O|+}}). However, even in this case, such solvated hydrogen cations are more realistically conceived as being organized into clusters that form species closer to H{{su|b=9}}{{chem|O|4|+}}.&lt;ref name="Okumura"&gt;{{cite journal

====Atomic hydrogen====
[[NASA]] has investigated the use of atomic hydrogen as a [[rocket propellant]]. It could be stored in liquid helium to prevent it from recombining into molecular hydrogen. When the helium is vaporized, the atomic hydrogen would be released and combine back to molecular hydrogen.  The result would be an intensely hot stream of hydrogen and helium gas.  The liftoff weight of rockets could be reduced by 50% by this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2002/TM-2002-211915.pdf |title=NASA/TM—2002-211915 : Solid Hydrogen Experiments for Atomic Propellants |access-date=27 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927045420/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2002/TM-2002-211915.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Interstellar space|interstellar]] hydrogen is in the form of atomic hydrogen because the atoms can seldom collide and combine. They are the source of the important 21&amp;nbsp;cm [[hydrogen line]] in [[astronomy]] at 1420&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/hydrogen.htm 21 cm Line]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrogen is the only element that has different names for its isotopes in common use today. During the early study of radioactivity, various heavy radioactive isotopes were given their own names, but such names are no longer used, except for deuterium and tritium. The symbols D and T (instead of {{chem|2|H}} and {{chem|3|H}}) are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium, but the corresponding symbol for protium, P, is already in use for [[phosphorus]] and thus is not available for protium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier (by Louis Jean Desire Delaistre)RENEW.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier]]
Lavoisier produced hydrogen for his experiments on mass conservation by reacting a flux of steam with metallic [[iron]] through an incandescent iron tube heated in a fire. Anaerobic oxidation of iron by the protons of water at high temperature can be schematically represented by the set of following reactions:

:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Fe + &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → FeO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:2 Fe + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:3 Fe + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Many metals such as [[zirconium]] undergo a similar reaction with water leading to the production of hydrogen.

Hydrogen was [[Liquid hydrogen|liquefied]] for the first time by [[James Dewar]] in 1898 by using [[regenerative cooling]] and his invention, the [[vacuum flask]].&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt; He produced [[solid hydrogen]] the next year.&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt; [[Deuterium]] was discovered in December 1931 by [[Harold Urey]], and [[tritium]] was prepared in 1934 by [[Ernest Rutherford]], [[Mark Oliphant]], and [[Paul Harteck]].&lt;ref name="Nostrand"/&gt; [[Heavy water]], which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932.&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt; [[François Isaac de Rivaz]] built the first [[de Rivaz engine]], an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806.

The first hydrogen-filled [[balloon]] was invented by [[Jacques Charles]] in 1783.&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt; Hydrogen provided the lift for the first reliable form of air-travel following the 1852 invention of the first hydrogen-lifted airship by [[Henri Giffard]].&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt; German count [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]] promoted the idea of rigid airships lifted by hydrogen that later were called [[Zeppelin]]s; the first of which had its maiden flight in 1900.&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt; Regularly scheduled flights started in 1910 and by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, they had carried 35,000 passengers without a serious incident. Hydrogen-lifted airships were used as observation platforms and bombers during the war.

The first non-stop transatlantic crossing was made by the British airship ''[[R34 (airship)|R34]]'' in 1919. Regular passenger service resumed in the 1920s and the discovery of [[helium]] reserves in the United States promised increased safety, but the U.S. government refused to sell the gas for this purpose. Therefore, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was used in the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|''Hindenburg'']] airship, which was destroyed in a midair fire over [[New Jersey]] on 6 May 1937.&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt; The incident was broadcast live on radio and filmed. Ignition of leaking hydrogen is widely assumed to be the cause, but later investigations pointed to the ignition of the [[aluminium|aluminized]] fabric coating by [[static electricity]]. But the damage to hydrogen's reputation as a [[lifting gas]] was already done and commercial hydrogen airship travel [[Rigid airship#Demise|ceased]].  Hydrogen is still used, in preference to non-flammable but more expensive helium, as a lifting gas for [[Weather balloon#Materials and equipment|weather balloons]].

In the same year the first [[hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator]] went into service with gaseous hydrogen as a [[coolant]] in the rotor and the stator in 1937 at [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], Ohio, by the Dayton Power &amp; Light Co.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/chronologicalhis00natirich/chronologicalhis00natirich_djvu.txt|title=A chronological history of electrical development from 600 B.C|author=National Electrical Manufacturers Association|year=1946|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the thermal conductivity of hydrogen gas, this is the most common type in its field today.

===Role in quantum theory===

One of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical theory]] arrived. Maxwell observed that the [[specific heat capacity]] of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unaccountably departs from that of a [[diatomic]] gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.&lt;ref name="Berman"&gt;{{cite journal

Hydrogen, as atomic H, is the most [[Natural abundance|abundant]] [[chemical element]] in the universe, making up 75% of [[Baryon|normal matter]] by [[mass]] and more than 90% by number of atoms. (Most of the mass of the universe, however, is not in the form of chemical-element type matter, but rather is postulated to occur as yet-undetected forms of mass such as [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Throughout the universe, hydrogen is mostly found in the [[atom]]ic and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] states, with properties quite different from those of molecular hydrogen. As a plasma, hydrogen's electron and proton are not bound together, resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity (producing the light from the Sun and other stars). The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the [[solar wind]] they interact with the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] giving rise to [[Birkeland current]]s and the [[Aurora (phenomenon)|aurora]]. Hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the [[interstellar medium]]. The large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped Lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the Universe up to [[redshift]] ''z''=4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Under ordinary conditions on Earth, elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, hydrogen gas is very rare in the Earth's atmosphere (1 [[part per million|ppm]] by volume) because of its light weight, which enables it to [[atmospheric escape|escape from Earth's gravity]] more easily than heavier gases.

== Production ==
{{main|Hydrogen production}}

{{chem|H|2}} is produced in chemistry and biology laboratories, often as a by-product of other reactions; in industry for the [[hydrogenation]] of [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] substrates; and in nature as a means of expelling [[redox|reducing]] equivalents in biochemical reactions.

=== Electrolysis of water ===

The [[electrolysis of water]] is a simple method of producing hydrogen. A low voltage current is run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the [[anode]] while gaseous hydrogen forms at the [[cathode]]. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs. energetic value of hydrogen produced) is in the range 88-94%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomassen|first1=Magnus|title=Cost reduction and performance increase of PEM electrolysers|url=http://www.fch.europa.eu/sites/default/files/Nov22_Session3_Panel%205_Slot%202_NOVEL-MEGASTACK_Thomassen%20%28ID%202891376%29.pdf|website=fch.europa.eu/|publisher=FCH JU|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

When determining the electrical efficiency of PEM (proton exchange membrane) electrolysis, the higher heat value (HHV) is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kruse|first1=Bjørnar|title=Hydrogen Status og muligheter|url=http://network.bellona.org/content/uploads/sites/3/Hydrogen_6-2002.pdf|website=bellona.org/|publisher=Bellona Norway|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the catalyst layer interacts with water as steam. As the process operates at 80&amp;nbsp;°C for PEM electrolysers the waste heat can be redirected through the system to create the steam, resulting in a higher overall electrical efficiency. The lower heat value (LHV) must be used for alkaline electrolysers as the process within these electrolysers requires water in liquid form and uses alkalinity to facilitate the breaking of the bond holding the hydrogen and oxygen atoms together. The lower heat value must also be used for fuel cells, as steam is the output rather than input.

=== Steam reforming ===

Hydrogen is often produced using natural gas, which involves the removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons at very high temperatures, with about 95% of hydrogen production coming from steam reforming around year 2000.&lt;ref name="Ogden 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ogden |first=J. M. |title=Prospects for building a hydrogen energy infrastructure |journal=Annual Review of Energy and the Environment |year=1999 |volume=24 |pages=227–279 |doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.24.1.227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--update?--&gt; Commercial bulk hydrogen is usually produced by the [[steam reforming]] of [[natural gas]].&lt;ref name="Oxtoby"&gt;{{cite book
| first=D. W.|last=Oxtoby|date=2002
| title=Principles of Modern Chemistry
| edition=5th|publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole
| isbn=978-0-03-035373-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At high temperatures (1000–1400&amp;nbsp;K, 700–1100&amp;nbsp;°C or 1300–2000&amp;nbsp;°F), steam (water vapor) reacts with [[methane]] to yield [[carbon monoxide]] and {{chem|H|2}}.

: {{chem|CH|4}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} → CO + 3 {{chem|H|2}}

This reaction is favored at low pressures but is nonetheless conducted at high pressures (2.0 &amp;nbsp;MPa, 20&amp;nbsp;atm or 600&amp;nbsp;[[inHg]]). This is because high-pressure {{chem|H|2}} is the most marketable product and [[pressure swing adsorption]] (PSA) purification systems work better at higher pressures. The product mixture is known as "[[synthesis gas]]" because it is often used directly for the production of [[methanol]] and related compounds. [[Hydrocarbon]]s other than methane can be used to produce synthesis gas with varying product ratios. One of the many complications to this highly optimized technology is the formation of coke or carbon:

: {{chem|CH|4}} → C + 2 {{chem|H|2}}

Consequently, steam reforming typically employs an excess of {{chem|H|2|O}}. Additional hydrogen can be recovered from the steam by use of carbon monoxide through the [[water gas shift reaction]], especially with an [[iron oxide]] catalyst. This reaction is also a common industrial source of [[carbon dioxide]]:&lt;ref name="Oxtoby" /&gt;

: CO + {{chem|H|2|O}} → {{chem|CO|2}} + {{chem|H|2}}

Other important methods for {{chem|H|2}} production include partial oxidation of hydrocarbons:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Hydrogen Properties, Uses, Applications| publisher=Universal Industrial Gases, Inc.| date=2007| url=http://www.uigi.com/hydrogen.html| accessdate=11 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: 2 {{chem|CH|4}} + {{chem|O|2}} → 2 CO + 4 {{chem|H|2}}

and the coal reaction, which can serve as a prelude to the shift reaction above:&lt;ref name="Oxtoby" /&gt;

: C + {{chem|H|2|O}} → CO + {{chem|H|2}}

Hydrogen is sometimes produced and consumed in the same industrial process, without being separated. In the [[Haber process]] for the [[Ammonia production|production of ammonia]], hydrogen is generated from natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Funderburg| first=E.| title=Why Are Nitrogen Prices So High?| publisher=The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation| date=2008| url=http://www.noble.org/Ag/Soils/NitrogenPrices/Index.htm| accessdate=11 March 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010509065844/http://www.noble.org/ag/Soils/NitrogenPrices/Index.htm| archivedate=9 May 2001| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electrolysis]] of [[brine]] to yield [[chlorine]] also produces hydrogen as a co-product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Lees| first=A.| title=Chemicals from salt| publisher=BBC|date=2007|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/chemistry/usefulproductsrocks/chemicals_saltrev3.shtml|accessdate=11 March 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071026052022/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/chemistry/usefulproductsrocks/chemicals_saltrev3.shtml |archivedate = 26 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metal-acid ===

In the [[laboratory]], {{chem|H|2}} is usually prepared by the reaction of dilute [[oxidizing acid|non-oxidizing acids]] on some reactive metals such as [[zinc]] with [[Kipp's apparatus]].

: Zn + 2 {{chem|H|+}} → {{chem|Zn|2+}} + {{chem|H|2}}

[[Aluminium]] can also produce {{chem|H|2}} upon treatment with bases:

: 2 Al + 6 {{chem|H|2|O}} + 2 {{chem|OH|-}} → 2 {{chem|Al(OH)|4|-}} + 3 {{chem|H|2}}

An alloy of aluminium and [[gallium]] in pellet form added to water can be used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces [[alumina]], but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does not need to be transported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Venere|first=E.|date=15 May 2007| url=http://news.uns.purdue.edu/x/2007a/070515WoodallHydrogen.html| title=New process generates hydrogen from aluminum alloy to run engines, fuel cells| publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=5 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermochemical ===

There are more than 200 thermochemical cycles which can be used for [[water splitting]], around a dozen of these cycles such as the [[iron oxide cycle]], [[cerium(IV) oxide–cerium(III) oxide cycle]], [[zinc zinc-oxide cycle]], [[sulfur-iodine cycle]], [[copper-chlorine cycle]] and [[hybrid sulfur cycle]] are under research and in testing phase to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review05/pd28_weimer.pdf|title=Development of solar-powered thermochemical production of hydrogen from water|format=PDF|first1=Al|last1=Weimer|date=25 May 2005|publisher=Solar Thermochemical Hydrogen Generation Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of laboratories (including in France, Germany, Greece, Japan, and the USA) are developing thermochemical methods to produce hydrogen from solar energy and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress07/ii_f_1_perret.pdf|title=Development of Solar-Powered Thermochemical Production of Hydrogen from Water, DOE Hydrogen Program, 2007|author=Perret, R.|accessdate=17 May 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anaerobic corrosion ===

Under anaerobic conditions, [[iron]] and [[steel alloy]]s are slowly oxidized by the protons of water concomitantly reduced in molecular hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}). The [[anaerobic corrosion]] of iron leads first to the formation of [[ferrous hydroxide]] (green rust) and can be described by the following reaction:

: Fe + 2 {{chem|H|2}}O → {{chem|Fe(OH)|2}} + {{chem|H|2}}

In its turn, under anaerobic conditions, the [[ferrous hydroxide]] ({{chem|Fe(OH)|2}}) can be oxidized by the protons of water to form [[magnetite]] and molecular hydrogen.
This process is described by the [[Schikorr reaction]]:

: 3 {{chem|Fe(OH)|2}} → {{chem|Fe|3|O|4|}} + 2 {{chem|H|2}}O + {{chem|H|2}}
: ''ferrous hydroxide → magnetite + water + hydrogen''

The well crystallized magnetite ({{chem|Fe|3|O|4|}}) is thermodynamically more stable than the ferrous hydroxide ({{chem|Fe(OH)|2}}).

This process occurs during the anaerobic corrosion of [[iron]] and [[steel]] in [[Anoxic waters|oxygen-free]] [[groundwater]] and in reducing [[soil]]s below the [[water table]].

=== Geological occurrence: the serpentinization reaction ===

In the absence of atmospheric oxygen ({{chem|O|2}}), in deep geological conditions prevailing far away from Earth atmosphere, hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) is produced during the process of [[Serpentinization#Hydrogen production by anaerobic oxidation of fayalite ferrous ions|serpentinization]] by the anaerobic oxidation by water protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) of the ferrous (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) silicate present in the crystal lattice of [[fayalite]] ({{chem|Fe|2|SiO|4}}, the [[olivine]] iron-endmember). The corresponding reaction leading to the formation of [[magnetite]] ({{chem|Fe|3|O|4|}}), [[quartz]] (Si{{chem|O|2}}) and hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) is the following:

: 3{{chem|Fe|2|SiO|4}} + 2 {{chem|H|2}}O → 2 {{chem|Fe|3|O|4|}} + 3 Si{{chem|O|2}} + 3 {{chem|H|2}}
: ''fayalite + water → magnetite + quartz + hydrogen''

This reaction closely resembles the [[Schikorr reaction]] observed in anaerobic oxidation of [[ferrous hydroxide]] in contact with water.

===Consumption in processes===
Large quantities of {{chem|H|2}} are needed in the petroleum and chemical industries.

The key consumers of {{chem|H|2}} in the petrochemical plant include [[hydrodealkylation]], [[hydrodesulfurization]], and [[hydrocracking]]. {{chem|H|2}} has several other important uses. {{chem|H|2}} is used as a hydrogenating agent, particularly in increasing the level of saturation of unsaturated fats and [[Vegetable oil|oils]] (found in items such as margarine), and in the production of [[methanol]]. It is similarly the source of hydrogen in the manufacture of [[hydrochloric acid]]. {{chem|H|2}} is also used as a [[reducing agent]] of metallic [[ore]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the [[Spin isomers of hydrogen|parahydrogen/orthohydrogen]] ratio (it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the container geometry.&lt;ref name=NASAH2/&gt;

'''Hydrosal Gel''' is a [[brand name]] for a first-line topical gel treatment for [[excessive sweating]]. The product is a registered trademark of Valeo Pharma Inc. Hydrosal Gel contains 15% [[Aluminum chloride|aluminum chloride hexahydrate]], an ingredient often used in strong [[antiperspirants]], as well as a [[hydroalcoholic]] [[salicylic acid]] gel base.

Hydrosal Gel has a low risk of irritation due to its proprietary gel base. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the gel vehicle is better tolerated than an alcohol solution most commonly found in other products for excessive sweating, resulting in less irritation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newman|first=Jerry L.|author2=John C.

'''Investigator Group Wilderness Protection Area''' is a [[protected area]] located in the [[Investigator Group]] of islands off the west coast of [[Eyre Peninsula]] in [[South Australia]] between {{convert|25|km|abbr=off}} to {{convert|70|km|abbr=off}} south-west of [[Elliston, South Australia|Elliston]].  
The wilderness protection area was proclaimed in August 2011 under the ''Wilderness Protection Act 1992'' in order to protect ‘important haul-out areas for the [[Australian sea lion]] and [[New Zealand fur seal]]’ and habitat for species such as [[White-faced storm petrel]]s, [[Cape Barren geese]] and [[Short-tailed shearwater|mutton bird]]s  and the [[Black-flanked rock-wallaby|Pearson Island black-footed rock-wallaby]].  The wilderness protection area was created from land excised from the '''Investigator Group Conservation Park'''.   It consists of the [[Ward Islands (South Australia)|Ward Islands]], the [[Topgallant Islands|Top Gallant Isles]], and the [[Pearson Isles]] which consist of [[Dorothee Island]], [[Pearson Island]] and [[Veteran Isles]] with exception of a portion of land on Pearson Island which is held by the [[Australian Maritime Safety Authority]] for ‘lighthouse purposes’.

'''Lead-Bismuth Eutectic''' or '''LBE''' is a [[eutectic]] [[alloy]] of [[lead]] (44.5%) and [[bismuth]] (55.5%) used as a [[coolant]] in some [[nuclear reactor]]s, and is a proposed coolant for the [[lead cooled fast reactor|lead-cooled fast reactor]], part of the [[Generation IV reactor]] initiative.
It has a [[melting point]] of 123.5&amp;nbsp;°C/255.3&amp;nbsp;°F (pure lead melts at 327&amp;nbsp;°C/621&amp;nbsp;°F, pure bismuth at 271&amp;nbsp;°C/520&amp;nbsp;°F) and a [[boiling point]] of 1,670&amp;nbsp;°C/3,038&amp;nbsp;°F.

Lead-bismuth alloys with between 30% and 75% bismuth all have melting points below 200&amp;nbsp;°C/392&amp;nbsp;°F.
Alloys with between 48% and 63% bismuth have melting points below 150&amp;nbsp;°C/302&amp;nbsp;°F.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nea.fr/html/science/reports/2007/pdf/chapter2.pdf Handbook on Lead-bismuth Eutectic Alloy and Lead Properties&lt;/ref&gt;
While lead expands slightly on melting and bismuth contracts slightly on melting, LBE has negligible change in volume on melting.

== History ==

The Soviet [[Alfa class submarine|Alfa-class submarine]]s used LBE as a coolant for their nuclear reactors throughout the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;

The Russians are the acknowledged experts in lead-bismuth cooled reactors, with [[OKB Gidropress]] (the Russian developers of the [[VVER]]-type [[Light-water reactor]]s) having special expertise in their development. The SVBR-75/100, a modern design of this type, is one example of the extensive Russian experience with this technology.&lt;ref name="SVBR75100"&gt;

[[Gen4 Energy]] (formerly [[Hyperion Power Generation]]), a United States firm connected with [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], announced plans in 2008 to design and deploy a [[uranium nitride]] fueled [[small modular reactor]] cooled by lead-bismuth eutectic for commercial power generation, [[district heating]], and [[desalinization]]. The proposed reactor, called the Gen4 Module, is planned as a 70 MW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; reactor of the sealed modular type, factory assembled and transported to site for installation, and transported back to factory for refueling.&lt;ref&gt;

==Advantages==
As compared to sodium-based liquid metal coolants such as liquid sodium or [[NaK]], lead-based coolants have significantly higher [[boiling point]]s, meaning a reactor can be operated without risk of coolant boiling at much higher temperatures. This improves [[thermal efficiency]] and could potentially allow [[hydrogen production]] through thermochemical processes.

Lead and LBE also do not react readily with water or air, in contrast to [[sodium]] and [[NaK]] which ignite spontaneously in air and react explosively with water. This means that lead- or LBE-cooled reactors, unlike sodium-cooled designs, would not need an intermediate coolant loop, which reduces the [[capital investment]] required for a plant.

Both lead and bismuth are also an excellent [[radiation shield]], blocking [[gamma radiation]] while simultaneously being virtually transparent to [[neutron]]s. In contrast, sodium will form the potent gamma emitter [[sodium-24]] ([[half-life]] 15 hours) following intense [[neutron radiation]], requiring a large radiation shield for the primary cooling loop.

As heavy nuclei, lead and bismuth can be used as [[spallation]] targets for non-fission neutron production, as in [[Accelerator Transmutation of Waste]] (see [[energy amplifier]]).

Both lead-based and sodium-based coolants have the advantage of relatively high boiling points as compared to water, meaning it is not necessary to pressurise the reactor even at high temperatures. This improves safety as it reduces the probability of a loss of coolant accident dramatically, and allows for [[passively safe]] designs.

==Limitations==
Lead and LBE coolant are more [[corrosion|corrosive]] to [[steel]] than sodium, and this puts an upper limit on the velocity of coolant flow through the reactor due to safety considerations. Furthermore, the higher melting points of lead and LBE (327&amp;nbsp;°C and 123.5&amp;nbsp;°C respectively) may mean that solidification of the coolant may be a greater problem when the reactor is operated at lower temperatures.

Finally, upon [[neutron radiation]] [[bismuth-209]], the main stable isotopes of bismuth present in LBE coolant, undergo [[neutron capture]] and subsequent [[beta decay]], forming [[polonium-210]], a potent [[Alpha decay|alpha emitter]]. The presence of radioactive polonium in the coolant would require special precautions to control [[radioactive contamination|alpha contamination]] during refueling of the reactor and handling components in contact with LBE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/q3l0570w2368l75w/ Long-lived radionuclides of sodium, lead-bismuth, and lead coolants in fast-neutron reactors.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lifeboat ethics''' is a metaphor for resource distribution proposed by the [[ecology|ecologist]] [[Garrett Hardin]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Lifeboat Ethics: the Case Against Helping the Poor
|accessdate=July 29, 2006

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardin's [[metaphor]] describes a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] bearing 50 people, with room for ten more.  The lifeboat is in an ocean surrounded by a hundred swimmers.  The "[[ethics]]" of the situation stem from the [[dilemma]] of whether (and under what circumstances) swimmers should be taken aboard the lifeboat.

Hardin compared the lifeboat metaphor to the [[Spaceship Earth]] model of resource distribution, which he criticizes by asserting that a spaceship would be directed by a single leader{{snd}}a captain{{snd}}which the Earth lacks.  Hardin asserts that the spaceship model leads to the [[tragedy of the commons]].  In contrast, the lifeboat metaphor presents individual lifeboats as [[wealth|rich]] nations and the swimmers as poor nations.

Other issues which can be raised include:
* Is it acceptable to deny an obviously dying passenger food and water to save it for others with a better chance to make it?
* Is it acceptable to ''jettison'' the dying passenger (knowing they will die within minutes) to make room for someone else?
* If food is low:
** is cannibalism of corpses acceptable after they die? 
** is it acceptable, if it is certain they are going to die in a day or two, to murder them to preserve resources or to let someone on the boat?
** is it acceptable, if it is certain they are going to die in a day or two, to murder them in order to commit cannibalism of their corpse where this will allow the survivors to survive for several additional weeks?

The third point regarding low supply of food had happened in reality before. A British court, in the ruling of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'' ruled that necessity is not a defense of murder.

Lifeboat ethics is closely related to [[environmental ethics]], [[utilitarianism]], and issues of [[resource depletion]].  Hardin uses lifeboat ethics to question [[policies]] such as [[foreign aid]], [[immigration]], and [[food bank]]s.

In mines where [[wolframite]] was mixed with [[cassiterite]], such as [[South Crofty]] and [[East Pool mine]] in [[Cornwall]] or with bismuth such as at the Shepherd and Murphy mine in [[Moina, Tasmania]], magnetic separation is used to separate the ores. At these mines, a device called a Wetherill's Magnetic Separator (invented by John Price Wetherill, 1844–1906)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In this machine, the raw ore, after [[calcination]] was fed onto a conveyor belt which passed underneath two pairs of [[electromagnet]]s under which further belts ran at right angles to the feed belt. The first pair of balls was weakly magnetized and served to draw off any iron ore present. The second pair were strongly magnetized and attracted the wolframite, which is weakly magnetic. These machines were capable of treating 10 tons of ore a day.

It is also used in electromagnetic cranes that separate magnetic material from scraps and unwanted substances.

One other application, not widely known but very important, is to use magnets in process industries to remove metal contaminants from product streams&lt;ref&gt;https://www.powderprocess.net/Equipments%20html/Magnets.html&lt;/ref&gt;. This takes a lot of importance in food or pharma industries.

MIMS is formed by inner-shell electrons that are normally resistant to molecular formation.  However, in stellar conditions, the inner-shell electrons become reactive to form molecular structures (MIMS) from combinations of all elements in the periodic table.  
 
MIMS upon dissociation can emit x-ray photons with energies up to 100 keV at extremely high conversion efficiencies from compression energy to photon energy.  MIMS is predicted to exist and dominate radiation processes in extreme astrophysical environments, such as large planet cores, star interiors, and [[black hole]] and [[neutron star]] surroundings. There, MIMS is predicted to enable highly energy-efficient transformation of the stellar compression energy into the radiation energy.

The right schematic illustration shows the proposed four stages of the K-shell MIMS (K-MIMS) formation and x-ray generation process.  Stage I: Individual atoms are subjected to the stellar compression and ready for absorbing the compression energy.  Stage II: The outer electron shells fuse together under increasing "stellar" pressure.    Stage III: At the peak pressure, via pressure ionization K-shell orbits form the K-MIMS, which is vibrationally hot and encapsulated by a Rydberg-like pseudo-L-Shell structure.  Stage IV: The K-MIMS cools down by ionizing ("boiling-off") a number of pseudo-L-shell electrons and subsequent optical decay by emitting an x-ray photon.  The dissociated atoms return their original atoms states and are ready for absorbing the compression energy.

MIMS also can be readily produced in laboratory and industrial environments, such as hypervelocity particle impact, [[laser fusion]] and [[z-machine]]. MIMS can be exploited for highly energy-efficient production of high intensity x-ray beams for a wide range of innovative applications, such as [[photolithography]], [[x-ray lasers]], and [[inertial fusion]].

==History==

The inner-shell-bound metastable quasimolecules were proposed to exist in the x-ray generating scattering process since the work by Mott in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  The existence of high energy quasimolecules in highly compressed matter (or strongly coupled plasma) was theoretically predicted in the ab initio quantum calculation by Younger et al. in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  In 2008, from the

Metastable Innsershell Molecular State (MIMS) that is homologous to the rare gas excimers was proposed by Bae in 2008&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to interpret the mysterious anomalous x-ray signals observed by Bae and his colleagues at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL) in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal

molecules."

To search for many-body effects in the highly compressed stellar materials, Bae and his colleagues at BNL generated and studied such materials by impacting various bio and water [[nanoparticle]] at hypervelocities (v~100&amp;nbsp;km/s) on various targets.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  In their study, anomalous signals were discovered, when the nanoparticles were directly impacted on and detected by Si particle detectors that had windows sufficiently thick enough to block the penetration of the nanoparticles completely. By exploiting the discovered anomalous signals, the feasibility of generating highly compressed "stellar" matter at shock pressures on the order of 10 TPa (100 Mbar) with the nanoparticle impact in a non-destructive laboratory setup was proven.  However, the nature of the signals and the underlying physics of their generation mechanism had not been understood for 15 years.

It was not until 2008 that Bae was able to unlock the mystery of the anomalous BNL signals owing to emerging sciences of the stellar materials.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal

After extensive analyses and theoretical modeling of these data, which involve a wide range of elements in the periodic table, a successful integration of the data into the frame of the unified MIMS model was demonstrated. Thereby, the MIMS model was firmly established and confirmed for any combinations of all elements in the periodic table.

Specifically, the extensive analyses&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; of the data that relate to hard x-ray generating collisions have resulted in a universal law (Z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–dependency) of the binding energy of the homonucleus MIMS bound by K-shell electrons (K-MIMS).  Here Z is the atomic number of the constituent atoms of the K-MIMS.  Bae further developed a unified theory to elucidate the Z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent behavior of the homonucleus K-MIMS, which behaves much like the helium excimer molecule: He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  The MIMS theory also predicted a 1/Z dependency law for the bond length of the homonucleus K-MIMS.  Based on the MIMS theory the uranium K-MIMS, for example, is predicted to have a 100 times smaller bond length, a 2,000 times larger binding energy, and a 5,000 times larger characteristic x-ray energy than the He excimer molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huber|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The predicted bond lengths of the bismuth and uranium K-MIMS are in excellent agreement with that estimated from the experimental results by researchers at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany &lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal

In typical environment, the ground state of rare gas atom dimers is electronically non-binding, but if their closed outershell electrons are excited, dimers can readily form transient bound molecules, excimers.  For example, the ground [[helium dimer|He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] state (1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1sσ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is electronically repulsive, but excitation of an electron can lead to Rydberg states (for example, the metastable, 1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1sσ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;2sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;: a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) with the He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title =Excimers |last = Birks|first = J.B.|journal = [[Reports on Progress in Physics]]|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |date = 1975|issue = 38|page = 903}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The low-lying metastable excited states of the dimer (the He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; excimer) are strongly covalently bound.   The metastable excimer can radiate to the free repulsive ground state.

The excimer formation is a critical step in energy-efficient conversion of the atomic electron excitation/ionization energy into the radiation energy in rare gas plasma for the excimer lasers. Without forming the excimers, the energy of the excited atoms would be rapidly lost by non-radiative collisional decay processes in the high pressure environment.  In other words, the excimer formation is a crucial step needed for efficient transformation of the atomic excitation energy to the radiation energy in an ultra-high pressure environment.  Analogously, the MIMS formation is a crucial step required for efficiently transforming the atomic core-excitation energy into the radiation energy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

[[File:K-MIMS binding energy - Z2 Fitting-New.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|K-MIMS binding energy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;]]

Based on the MIMS model,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; a schematic potential curve was proposed for the K-shell MIMS (K-MIMS) and illustrated in the right figure. In the "electronically-cold" highly compressed plasma, a K-shell core ion with a hole, [K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;], collides with another core ion without a hole, [K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;], to form a near-dissociative K-shell MIMS (K-MIMS) and its excess energy transforms into the vibration energy.  Such a vibrationally hot K-MIMS in the plasma is denoted here by &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Subsequently, a Rydberg-like pseudo-L-shell forms around the K-MIMS core ions that are proposed to go through a rapid relaxation into the lowest vibrational state by ionizing a number of electrons in the pseudo-L-shell.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  The vibrationally cold K-MIMS without an L-shell hole is denoted by [K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;].

Because the n holes can be distributed among 2s and 2p orbits, thus the maximum value of n is 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1235049|title = Vibrational autoionization in polyatomic molecules|last = Pratt|first = S.T.|journal = [[Annual Review of Physical Chemistry]] |date = 2005|pages = 281–308|volume = 56 |doi=10.1146/annurev.physchem.56.092503.141204 |pmid=15796702|bibcode = 2005ARPC...56..281P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The statistically distributed K-MIMS decays into the lower L-shell MIMS (L-MIMS), [K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;],
by emitting an x-ray photon, and subsequently the L-MIMS dissociates into two atomic ions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Based on the previously proposed MIMS model,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; a wide range of the K-MIMS  binding energies were extracted from the extensive ranges of experimental data from He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* excimer to UAu* MIMS (for 2 ≤ Z ≤ 92). The right shows these data plotted against the constituent atom atomic number Z.  The lowest bound state (a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) of He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* excimer has a binding energy of 1.96 eV, which is plotted in the right figure. These data are plotted against Z in the figure.

The overall data trend shows a Z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dependency. Overall fitting is excellent, thus indicates that the K-MIMS can be modeled with a He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*-like excimer with core K-shell ions with an atomic number Z to the first order. Note that the binding energies are about one order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding K-shell satellite x-ray energies, which follow the (Z-1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dependency of the [[Moseley's law]].

[[File:K-MIMS Bond Length-New.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|K-MIMS bond length.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;]]

An intuitive analytical theory has been developed and is presented here to illuminate the universal Z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent behavior of K-MIMS by Bae. In this theory, the homologous molecular characteristics of K-MIMS is proposed to be primarily determined by the 1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bonding molecular orbit of the homologous core molecular ion under the assumption that other effects of surrounding electrons and atoms can be considered as a minor perturbation.  The quantum characteristics of excimer can be described by a stable core molecular ion surrounded by Rydberg-like electron orbits.  The lowest metastable electronic state of He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* (a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is 1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1sσ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;2sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, thus the proposed K-MIMS model should have a similar molecular orbital.  In this case the bonding of K-MIMS is expected to be primarily dominated by the 1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbital.  Intuitively, the 1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbital can be approximated in the frame of the [[LCAO]] model by a linear combination of the two 1s atomic orbitals, of which size is proportional to 1/Z.  Therefore, the K-MIMS size, thus the bond length, is predicted to be proportional to 1/Z.  Therefore, to the first order the K-MIMS bond length is predicted to be proportional to 1/Z.   The right figure shows the predicted K-MIMS bond length as a function of the constituent atom atomic number, Z.  The bond length of He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* (a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is ~1.05 A, and the solid line represents a 1/Z curve that is extrapolated from the bond length of He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* (a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).

Currently, there is no other direct experimental data or theoretical results on the bond length of the K-MIMS.  However, in the recent work by Mokler's group,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; the sizes of quasimolecules were estimated from the x-ray cross-section enhancement of both projectile x-rays and target x-rays in H-like ion impact.   The enhancement was interpreted to result from an extensive K-K electron sharing (transition of a hole) between the projectile and target ions due to the quasimolecule effect during the collision.  Based on the K-MIMS theory as illustrated in the right figure, the K-K sharing distance can approximate the K-MIMS bond length.  The two data points are the K-K sharing distances of U&lt;sup&gt;91+&lt;/sup&gt; ion impact on Au and Bi&lt;sup&gt;82+&lt;/sup&gt; ion impact on Au, which were estimated from the cross sections.  The Z values were approximated by the (Z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; +Z&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;)/2, where Z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the atomic number of the projectile ion and Z&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is that of the target atom.  The predicted 1/Z curve is in excellent agreement with these data points as shown in the right figure.

MIMS can be also formed with two different elements.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal

Pressures required to form heteronucleus MIMS are predicted to be considerably smaller than that for homonucleus MIMS.

==Other models for inner-shell bound molecules==

===Quasimolecules in heavy ion collisions===

In the field of x-ray generation by heavy ion impact on solids, the search for the x-ray signatures of the inner-shell-bound quasimolecule in the x-ray generating scattering process can be traced down to the work by Mott in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = On the Theory of Excitation by Collision with Heavy Particles|last = Mott|first = N.F.|journal = [[Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society]]|accessdate = |doi = 10.1017/s0305004100009816|pmid = |pages = 553|date = 1931|volume = 27|issue = 4|bibcode = 1931PCPS...27..553M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The quasimolecule can be considered as a collisional complex that is a manifestation of MIMS during collision processes.  However, the actual experimental searches for such x-ray signatures of the quasimolecule in x-ray generation in heavy ion impact started much later, in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  One of the primary motivations of these researches was to explore a super-heavy quasimolecule/quasiatom with a combined atomic number exceeding 100, which was predicted to behave like a transuranium atom in the united atom frame.

In the early heavy ion collision researches, the cross-sections for carbon K x-ray production were measured for a wide range of ions incident on a carbon target, at energies from 20 to 80 keV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url =  |last = Der|display-authors = etal|first = R.C.|title =Production of carbon characteristic x-rays by heavy-ion bombardment |journal = [[Physical Review Letters]]|accessdate = |doi = 10.1103/physrevlett.21.1731|pmid = |date = 1968|pages = 1731–1732|volume = 21|issue = 26|bibcode = 1968PhRvL..21.1731D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbon Kα x-ray generation cross sections for the heavy ions, such as Ar&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Xe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, were discovered to be several orders of magnitude larger than those by light ions, such as H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and He&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which were consistent with the values predicted by the direct Coulomb scattering theory.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  The anomalous cross sections for heavy ions were qualitatively interpreted in terms of the electron-promotion mechanism of the molecular orbital theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Interpretation of Ar&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; - Ar collisions |last = Fano|first = U.|journal = [[Physical Review Letters]]|accessdate = |doi = 10.1103/physrevlett.14.627|pmid = |last2 = Lichten|first2 = W.|date = 1965|volume = 14|issue = 16 |pages = 627–629|bibcode = 1965PhRvL..14..627F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his papers, Bae proposed that the production of the shocked regions that are able to bear abundant MIMS by the heavy ion impacts as in the nanoparticle impact&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; can be another major factor for the observed x-ray yield enhancement.

More importantly, there had been extensive theoretical and experimental researches on intense K-shell satellites above the Kα line of various solids that were bombarded by heavy ions with kinetic energies on the order of 10 MeV.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  In the researches, the K-shell satellites were interpreted to result from radiative decays of atoms with multiple holes, one of which is in the K-shell and others in the L-shell.  Striking differences between the satellite spectra obtained with light ions, such as electrons and protons, and the spectra with heavy ions were discovered.  In addition to the intensity difference, the x-ray spectra obtained with heavy ions showed many more peaks with multiple L-shell holes than those with light ions.  The x-ray energies of the satellites were consistent with those obtained by the ab initio calculations based on the atomic model x-ray emissions that involve varying number of L-shell holes.  However, the satellite data for larger number of L-shell holes significantly deviated from the calculation results.  Based on the MIMS model, the x-ray satellite structures are now understood to result from the interaction between the vibrational state of K-MIMS and the L-shell electron ionization channels.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Younger's quasimolecules===
Overall, Younger et al.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1233866|title = Quantum calculations of the electronic structures of a many-atom plasma |last = Younger|display-authors = etal|first = S.M.|journal = [[Physical Review Letters]]|accessdate = |doi = 10.1103/physrevlett.61.962|pmid = 10039479|date = 1988|volume = 61|issue = 8 |pages = 962–965|bibcode = 1988PhRvL..61..962Y |format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the possibility of forming transient molecular states with closed-shell electrons in ab initio calculations for the first time for frozen or slow moving ion systems that can be approximated with the [[Born-Oppenheimer approximation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24231">'''Nanocomposite''' is a multiphase solid material where one of the phases has one, two or three dimensions of less than 100 [[nanometers]] (nm), or structures having nano-scale repeat distances between the different phases that make up the material.

The idea behind Nanocomposite is to use building blocks with dimensions in nanometre range to design and create new materials with unprecedented flexibility and improvement in their physical properties.

In the broadest sense this definition can include [[porous media]], [[colloid]]s, [[gel]]s and [[copolymer]]s, but is more usually taken to mean the solid combination of a bulk matrix and nano-dimensional phase(s) differing in properties due to dissimilarities in structure and chemistry. The mechanical, electrical, thermal, optical, electrochemical, catalytic properties of the nanocomposite will differ markedly from that of the component materials. Size limits for these effects have been proposed,&lt;ref name=kamigaito1991&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kamigaito | first1 = O | year = 1991 | title = What can be improved by nanometer composites? | url = | journal = J.

Nanocomposites are found in nature, for example in the structure of the [[abalone|abalone shell]] and bone. The use of nanoparticle-rich materials long predates the understanding of the physical and chemical nature of these materials. Jose-Yacaman ''et al.''&lt;ref name=mayan&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.273.5272.223|title=Maya Blue Paint: An Ancient Nanostructured Material|year=1996|last1=Jose-Yacaman|first1=M.|last2=Rendon|first2=L.|last3=Arenas|first3=J.|last4=Serra Puche|first4=M.

From the mid-1950s nanoscale organo-clays have been used to control flow of polymer solutions (e.g. as paint viscosifiers) or the constitution of gels (e.g. as a thickening substance in cosmetics, keeping the preparations in homogeneous form). By the 1970s polymer/[[Clay minerals|clay]] composites were the topic of textbooks,&lt;ref name=theng&gt;B.K.G. Theng "''Formation and Properties of Clay Polymer Complexes''", Elsevier, NY 1979; {{ISBN|978-0-444-41706-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the term "nanocomposites" was not in common use.

In mechanical terms, nanocomposites differ from conventional [[composite material]]s due to the exceptionally high surface to volume ratio of the reinforcing phase and/or its exceptionally high [[aspect ratio]]. The reinforcing material can be made up of particles (e.g. minerals), sheets (e.g. exfoliated clay stacks) or fibres (e.g. carbon nanotubes or electrospun fibres). The area of the interface between the matrix and reinforcement phase(s) is typically an order of magnitude greater than for conventional composite materials. The matrix material properties are significantly affected in the vicinity of the reinforcement. Ajayan ''et al.''&lt;ref name=ajayan&gt;{{cite book|title=Nanocomposite science and technology|author1=P.M. Ajayan |author2=L.S. Schadler |author3=P.V. Braun |publisher=Wiley|year=2003|isbn=978-3-527-30359-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; note that with polymer nanocomposites, properties related to local chemistry, degree of thermoset cure, polymer chain mobility, polymer chain conformation, degree of polymer chain ordering or crystallinity can all vary significantly and continuously from the interface with the reinforcement into the bulk of the matrix.

This large amount of reinforcement surface area means that a relatively small amount of nanoscale reinforcement can have an observable effect on the macroscale properties of the composite. For example, adding [[carbon nanotubes]] improves the [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]]. Other kinds of nanoparticulates may result in enhanced [[optics|optical properties]], [[dielectric|dielectric properties]], heat resistance or mechanical properties such as [[stiffness]], [[strength of materials|strength]] and resistance to wear and damage. In general, the nano reinforcement is dispersed into the matrix during processing. The percentage by weight (called ''mass fraction'') of the nanoparticulates introduced can remain very low (on the order of 0.5% to 5%) due to the low filler [[percolation threshold]], especially for the most commonly used non-spherical, high aspect ratio fillers (e.g. nanometer-thin platelets, such as clays, or nanometer-diameter cylinders, such as carbon nanotubes). The orientation and arrangement of asymmetric nanoparticles, thermal property mismatch at the interface, interface density per unit volume of nanocomposite, and polydispersity of nanoparticles significantly affect the effective thermal conductivity of nanocomposites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tian | first1 = Zhiting | last2 = Hu | first2 = Han | last3 = Sun | first3 = Ying | year = 2013 | title = A molecular dynamics study of effective thermal conductivity in nanocomposites | url = | journal = Int.

==Ceramic-matrix nanocomposites==

Ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) consist of ceramic fibers embedded in a ceramic matrix. The matrix and fibers can consist of any ceramic material, including carbon and carbon fibers. The [[ceramic]] occupying most of the volume is often from the group of oxides, such as nitrides, borides, silicides, whereas the second component is often a [[metal]]. Ideally both components are finely dispersed in each other in order to elicit particular optical, electrical and magnetic properties &lt;ref name=EiKr1998&gt;{{cite journal|author = F. E. Kruis, H. Fissan and A. Peled|title = Synthesis of nanoparticles in the gas phase for electronic, optical and magnetic applications – a review|journal = J. Aerosol Sci.|volume = 29|pages = 511–535|year = 1998|doi = 10.1016/S0021-8502(97)10032-5|issue = 5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as tribological, corrosion-resistance and other protective properties.&lt;ref name=Zhan2003&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Zhang |author2=D. Sun |author3=Y. Fu |author4=H. Du |title = Recent advances of superhard nanocomposite coatings: a review|journal = Surf. Coat.

The binary [[phase diagram]] of the mixture should be considered in designing ceramic-metal nanocomposites and measures have to be taken to avoid a chemical reaction between both components. The last point mainly is of importance for the metallic component that may easily react with the ceramic and thereby lose its metallic character. This is not an easily obeyed constraint because the preparation of the ceramic component generally requires high process temperatures. The safest measure thus is to carefully choose immiscible metal and ceramic phases. A good example of such a combination is represented by the ceramic-metal composite of [[TiO2|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Copper|Cu]], the mixtures of which were found immiscible over large areas in the Gibbs’ triangle of Cu-O-Ti.&lt;ref name=Effe2001&gt;{{cite book|title = Ternary Alloys.

Effenberg, F. Aldinger  |author2=P. Rogl |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ceramic-matrix nanocomposites was also applied to [[thin film]]s that are solid layers of a few nm to some tens of µm thickness deposited upon an underlying substrate and that play an important role in the functionalization of technical surfaces. [[Sputter deposition#Gas flow sputtering|Gas flow sputtering]] by the [[Hollow cathode effect|hollow cathode]] technique turned out as a rather effective technique for the preparation of nanocomposite layers. The process operates as a vacuum-based [[Deposition (physics)|deposition]] technique and is associated with high deposition rates up to some µm/s and the growth of nanoparticles in the gas phase. Nanocomposite layers in the ceramics range of composition were prepared from [[TiO2|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Copper|Cu]] by the hollow cathode technique &lt;ref name= Birk2004&gt;{{cite journal|author1=M.

==Metal-matrix nanocomposites==

{{Expand section|date=November 2008}}

Metal matrix nanocomposites can also be defined as reinforced metal matrix composites. This type of composites can be classified as continuous and non-continuous reinforced materials. One of the more important nanocomposites is [[Carbon nanotube metal matrix composites]],  which is an emerging new material that is being developed to take advantage of the high tensile strength and electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janas|first1=Dawid|last2=Liszka|first2=Barbara|title=Copper matrix nanocomposites based on carbon nanotubes or graphene|journal=Mater. Chem. Front.|volume=2|pages=22–35|date=2017|doi=10.1039/C7QM00316A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical to the realization of CNT-MMC possessing optimal properties in these areas are the development of synthetic techniques that are (a) economically producible, (b) provide for a homogeneous dispersion of nanotubes in the metallic matrix, and (c) lead to strong interfacial adhesion between the metallic matrix and the carbon nanotubes. In addition to carbon nanotube metal matrix composites, boron nitride reinforced metal matrix composites and carbon nitride metal matrix composites are the new research areas on metal matrix nanocomposites.&lt;ref&gt;S. R. Bakshi, D. Lahiri, and A. Argawal, ''Carbon nanotube reinforced metal matrix composites - A Review'', International Materials Reviews, vol. 55, (2010), http://web.eng.fiu.edu/agarwala/PDF/2010/12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study, comparing the mechanical properties (Young's modulus, compressive yield strength, flexural modulus and flexural yield strength) of single- and multi-walled reinforced polymeric (polypropylene fumarate—PPF) nanocomposites to tungsten disulfide nanotubes reinforced PPF nanocomposites suggest that tungsten disulfide nanotubes reinforced PPF nanocomposites possess significantly higher mechanical properties and tungsten disulfide nanotubes are better reinforcing agents than carbon nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lalwani|first=G|author2=Henslee, AM|author3=Farshid, B|author4=Parmar, P|author5=Lin, L|author6=Qin, YX|author7=Kasper, FK|author8=Mikos, AG|author9=Sitharaman, B|title=Tungsten disulfide nanotubes reinforced biodegradable polymers for bone tissue engineering|journal=Acta Biomaterialia|date=September 2013|volume=9|issue=9|pages=8365–73|pmid=23727293|pmc=3732565|doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2013.05.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increases in the mechanical properties can be attributed to a uniform dispersion of inorganic nanotubes in the polymer matrix (compared to carbon nanotubes that exist as micron sized aggregates) and increased crosslinking density of the polymer in the presence of tungsten disulfide nanotubes (increase in crosslinking density leads to an increase in the mechanical properties). These results suggest that inorganic nanomaterials, in general, may be better reinforcing agents compared to carbon nanotubes.

Another kind of nanocomposite is the energetic nanocomposite, generally as a hybrid sol–gel with a silica base, which, when combined with metal oxides and nano-scale aluminum powder, can form ''superthermite'' materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/247064.pdf |title=''Making nanostructured pyrotechnics in a Beaker'' |accessdate=2008-09-28 |format=pdf |last=Gash |first=AE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/244137.pdf |title=''Energetic nanocomposites with sol-gel chemistry: synthesis, safety, and characterization'', LLNL UCRL-JC-146739 |accessdate=2008-09-28 |format=pdf |last=Gash |first=AE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10669-008-9182-4|title=Environmental anomalies at the World Trade Center: evidence for energetic materials|year=2008|last1=Ryan|first1=Kevin R.|last2=Gourley|first2=James R.|last3=Jones|first3=Steven E.|journal=The Environmentalist|volume=29|pages=56–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janeta|first=Mateusz|last2=John|first2=Łukasz|last3=Ejfler|first3=Jolanta|last4=Szafert|first4=Sławomir|date=2014-11-24|title=High-Yield Synthesis of Amido-Functionalized Polyoctahedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxanes by Using Acyl Chlorides|journal=Chemistry: A European Journal|language=en|volume=20|issue=48|pages=15966–15974|doi=10.1002/chem.201404153|pmid=25302846|issn=1521-3765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polymer-matrix nanocomposites==
{{main article|Polymer nanocomposite}}
In the simplest case, appropriately adding [[nanoparticulates]] to a polymer matrix can enhance its performance, often dramatically, by simply capitalizing on the nature and properties of the nanoscale filler &lt;ref name=nanocomposite_definition&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nmat1812|title=Nanocomposites: Stiffer by design|year=2007|last1=Manias|first1=Evangelos|journal=Nature Materials|volume=6|pages=9–11|pmid=17199118|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (these materials are better described by the term '''''nanofilled polymer composites''''' &lt;ref name=nanocomposite_definition/&gt;). This strategy is particularly effective in yielding high performance composites, when uniform dispersion of the filler is achieved and the properties of the nanoscale filler are substantially different or better than those of the matrix. The uniformity of the dispersion is in all nanocomposites is counteracted by thermodynamically driven phase separation.  Clustering of nanoscale fillers produces aggregates that serve as structural defects and result in failure.  Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly when nanometer scale layers of [[nanoparticulates]] and a polymers are added one by one. LbL composites display performance parameters 10-1000 times better that the traditional nanocomposites made by extrusion or batch-mixing. 

Nanoparticles such as graphene &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rafiee|first1=M.A. et al.|title=Enhanced Mechanical Properties of Nanocomposites at Low Graphene Content|journal=ACS Nano|date=December 3, 2009|volume=3|issue=12|pages=3884–3890|doi=10.1021/nn9010472|pmid=19957928}}&lt;/ref&gt;, carbon nanotubes, molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide are being used as reinforcing agents to fabricate mechanically strong biodegradable polymeric nanocomposites for bone tissue engineering applications. The addition of these nanoparticles in the polymer matrix at low concentrations (~0.2 weight %) cause significant improvements in the compressive and flexural mechanical properties of polymeric nanocomposites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lalwani | first1 = Gaurav | last2 = Henslee | first2 = Allan M. | last3 = Farshid | first3 = Behzad | last4 = Lin | first4 = Liangjun | last5 = Kasper | first5 = F.

The results suggest that mechanical reinforcement is dependent on the nanostructure morphology, defects, dispersion of nanomaterials in the polymer matrix, and the cross-linking density of the polymer. In general, two-dimensional nanostructures can reinforce the polymer better than one-dimensional nanostructures, and inorganic nanomaterials are better reinforcing agents than carbon based nanomaterials. In addition to mechanical properties, polymer nanocomposites based on carbon nanotubes or graphene have been used to enhance a wide range of properties, giving rise to functional materials for a wide range of high added value applications in fields such as energy conversion and storage, sensing and biomedical tissue engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gatti|first=Teresa|last2=Vicentini|first2=Nicola|last3=Mba|first3=Miriam|last4=Menna|first4=Enzo|date=2016-02-01|title=Organic Functionalized Carbon Nanostructures for Functional Polymer-Based Nanocomposites|journal=European Journal of Organic Chemistry|language=en|volume=2016|issue=6|pages=1071–1090|doi=10.1002/ejoc.201501411|issn=1099-0690}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, multi-walled carbon nanotubes based polymer nanocomposites have been used for the enhancement of the electrical conductivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Singh|first1= BP|last2= Singh|first2= Deepankar|last3= Mathur|first3= R.

Nanoscale dispersion of filler or controlled nanostructures in the composite can introduce new physical properties and novel behaviors that are absent in the unfilled matrices. This effectively changes the nature of the original matrix &lt;ref name=nanocomposite_definition/&gt; (such composite materials can be better described by the term '''''genuine nanocomposites''''' or '''''hybrids''''' &lt;ref name=nanocomposite_definition/&gt;). Some examples of such new properties are fire resistance or flame retardancy,&lt;ref name=FR_NC_book&gt;"''Flame Retardant Polymer Nanocomposites''" A. B. Morgan, C. A. Wilkie (eds.), Wiley, 2007; {{ISBN|978-0-471-73426-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accelerated biodegradability.

A range of polymeric nanocomposites are used for biomedical applications such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, cellular therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaharwar|first1=Akhilesh K.|last2=Peppas|first2=Nicholas A.|last3=Khademhosseini|first3=Ali|title=Nanocomposite hydrogels for biomedical applications|journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|date=March 2014|volume=111|issue=3|pages=441–453|doi=10.1002/bit.25160|pmid=24264728|pmc=3924876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carrow|first1=James K.|last2=Gaharwar|first2=Akhilesh K.|title=Bioinspired Polymeric Nanocomposites for Regenerative Medicine|journal=Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics|date=November 2014|pages=248–264|doi=10.1002/macp.201400427|volume=216|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to unique interactions between polymer and nanoparticles, a range of property combinations can be engineered to mimic native tissue structure and properties. A range of natural and synthetic polymers are used to design polymeric nanocomposites for biomedical applications including starch, cellulose, alginate, chitosan, collagen, gelatin, and fibrin, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(caprolactone) (PCL), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS). A range of nanoparticles including ceramic, polymeric, metal oxide and carbon-based nanomaterials are incorporated within polymeric network to obtain desired property combinations.

==Magnetic nanocomposites==
Nanocomposites that can respond to an external stimulus are of increased interest due to the fact that, due to the large amount of interaction between the phase interfaces, the stimulus response can have a larger affect on the composite as a whole.  The external stimulus can take many forms, such as a magnetic, electrical, or mechanical field.  Specifically, magnetic nanocomposites are useful for use in these applications due to the nature of magnetic material's ability to respond both to electrical and magnetic stimuli.  The penetration depth of a magnetic field is also high, leading to an increased area that the nanocomposite is affected by and therefore an increased response.  In order to respond to a magnetic field, a matrix can be easily loaded with nanoparticles or nanorods  The different morphologies for magnetic nanocomposite materials are vast, including matrix dispersed nanoparticles, core-shell nanoparticles,
colloidal crystals, macroscale spheres, or janus-type nanostructures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behrens|first=Silke|last2=Appel|first2=Ingo|date=2016|title=Magnetic nanocomposites|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|language=en|volume=39|pages=89–96|doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2016.02.005|pmid=26938504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behrens|first=Silke|date=2011|title=Preparation of functional magnetic nanocomposites and hybrid materials: recent progress and future directions|journal=Nanoscale|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=877–892|doi=10.1039/C0NR00634C|pmid=21165500}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Magnetic nanocomposites can be utilized in a vast number of applications, including catalytic, medical, and technical.  For example, palladium is a common transition metal used in catalysis reactions.  Magnetic nanoparticle-supported palladium complexes can be used in catalysis to increase the efficiency of the palladium in the reaction  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Yinghuai|date= 2010|title=Magnetic Nanocomposites: A New Perspective in Catalysis|journal=Chemcatchem|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=365–374|doi=10.1002/cctc.200900314}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Magnetic nanocomposites can also be utilized in the medical field, with magnetic nanorods embedded in a polymer matrix can aid in more precise drug delivery and release.  Finally, magnetic nanocomposites can be used in high frequency/high temperature applications.  For example, multi-layer structures can be fabricated for use in electronic applications.  An electrodeposited Fe/Fe oxide multi-layered sample can be an example of this application of magnetic nanocomposites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Varga|first=L.K.|date= 2007|title=Soft magnetic nanocomposites for high-frequency and high-temperature applications|journal=Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials|language=en|volume=316|issue=2|pages=442–447|doi=10.1016/j.jmmm.2007.03.180}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Oil!''''' is a novel by [[Upton Sinclair]], first published in 1926–27 and told as a [[third-person narrative]], with only the opening pages written in the first person. The book was written in the context of the [[Warren Harding|Harding administration]]'s [[Teapot Dome Scandal]] and takes place in [[Southern California]]. It is a social and political satire skewering the human foibles of all its characters.

The main character is James Arnold Ross Jr., nicknamed Bunny, son of an oil tycoon. Bunny's sympathetic feelings toward oilfield workers and [[socialists]] provoke arguments with his father throughout the story.

The novel served as a loose inspiration for the 2007 film ''[[There Will Be Blood]]''.

==Characters==
*'''James Arnold Ross''' (aka '''Dad'''): is a self-made oil millionaire.
*'''James Arnold "Bunny" Ross Jr.''': the protagonist, is the only son of a self-made oil millionaire.
*'''Paul Watkins''': a farmer's son who runs away from home, is tutored by a [[Freethought|free thinker]], and becomes an advocate for the rights of laborers. After spending time in Siberia after World War I, he sympathizes with [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevism]] and becomes a Communist.
*'''Vernon Roscoe''': Dad's business partner, and arguably the novel's antagonist. He is a greedy business man who helps bribe the government to acquire the land in Teapot Dome to drill oil. He also works to crush the unions that oppose him by bribing the authorities to throw its members into jail.
*'''Alberta "Bertie" Ross''': Bunny's older sister. An aspiring socialite.
*'''Aunt Emma''': Bunny's aunt, widow of J. Arnold Ross' brother. She lives with the family.
*'''Ruth Watkins''': Paul's younger sister, who is Bunny's age.
*'''Eli Watkins''': Paul's brother, who becomes an evangelical preacher.

==Plot==
James Arnold "Dad" Ross and his son, James Jr. ("Bunny") are introduced as they drive through southern [[California]] to meet with the Watkins family, who are leasing out some oil property they own. They find out that the family is deadlocked about how the properties and proceeds should be divided. While Dad and Bunny go [[quail]] hunting on the Watkins' goat ranch, they find oil. At Bunny's urging, Dad tries to prevent the elder Watkins from beating his daughter Ruth; trying to convince them that he has received a "third revelation" which prohibits parents from beating their children. The plan backfires when Eli, Ruth's brother, interjects himself into the discussion and claims that ''he'' has received the revelation.

As drilling begins at the Watkins ranch, Bunny begins to realize his father's business methods are not entirely ethical. After a worker is killed in an accident and an oil well is destroyed in a [[blowout (well drilling)|blowout]], Dad's workforce goes on [[labor strike|strike]]. Bunny is torn between loyalty to Dad and his friendship to Ruth and her rebellious brother Paul, who support the workers. Paul is drafted into [[World War I]] and, when the conflict is over, remains in [[Siberia]] to fight the rising [[Bolsheviks]]. Back home, Bunny enrolls in college, and he becomes increasingly involved with [[socialism]] through a classmate, Rachel Menzies. Paul returns home and tells of his travels, explaining he has become a [[communist]].

Bunny accompanies Dad to the seaside mansion of his business associate Vernon Roscoe. Dad and Roscoe flee the country to avoid being [[subpoena]]ed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in the [[Teapot Dome scandal]]. Before Dad goes away, Bunny proposes parting ways with his father and earning his own way in the world; Dad is confused and hurt, but not unsupportive. Overseas, Dad meets and marries Mrs. Olivier, a widow and [[Spiritualist]], but soon passes away from [[pneumonia]]. Bunny decides to dedicate his life and inheritance to [[social justice]] while Roscoe moves to get control of the bulk of Dad's estate. Bunny and his sister Bertie are swindled out of most of their inheritance by Roscoe and Mrs. Olivier. 

Bunny marries Rachel and they dedicate themselves to establishing a socialist institution of learning; Eli, by now a successful [[evangelism|evangelist]], falsely claims that Paul underwent a [[deathbed conversion]] to [[Christianity]].

==Basis==
The book is loosely based on the life of [[Edward L. Doheny]] (and the company he co-founded, [[Pan American Petroleum &amp; Transport Company]], the California assets of which became Pan American Western Petroleum Company), and also the strategic alliance Union-Independent Producers Agency, a consortium created in 1910 to bring oil via pipeline from Kern County to the Pacific Coast facilities of [[Unocal Corporation|Union Oil Company]] at Port Harford (now called Port San Luis just west of [[Avila Beach, California|Avila Beach]]).

Numerous parallels exist between the opening setting of the novel, Beach City, and the city of Huntington Beach. Huntington Beach was originally called "Pacific City", for which Beach City is a play off of both names. The novel states that the area had street names like "Telegraph" and "Beach City Blvd". Telegraph Road would be the last street crossed before getting off the highway onto Beach Blvd in the town of Buena Park to travel south to Huntington Beach. James Arnold Ross and Bunny stay in a hotel at the intersection of Beach City Blvd and Coast Drive, similar to Beach Blvd and what would later develop into Pacific Coast Highway, where a hotel and water resort once resided in the early 1900s. In the novel, Beach City is covered in beet and cabbage fields. Huntington Beach historically was covered in beet and celery fields. In the novel, the primary oil field found is on "Prospect Hill". The first confirmed oil wells in Huntington Beach were located on a series of bluffs.

The character of Eli Watkins is loosely based on the famous evangelist [[Aimee Semple McPherson|Aimee McPherson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Times - Blood and ‘Oil!’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/books/review/Essay-t.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fig-leaf edition==
[[File:Upton Sinclair Oil.jpg|thumb|Upton Sinclair selling the "[[Fig Leaf Edition]]" of ''Oil!'' in Boston]]
''Oil!'' was  [[banned in Boston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tufts Journal - Hot to Get Banned in Boston|url=http://tuftsjournal.tufts.edu/archives/878/how-to-get-banned-in-boston|accessdate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its motel sex scene. Sinclair's publisher printed 150 copies of a "[[fig-leaf edition]]" with the offending nine pages blacked out. Sinclair protested the banning and hoped to bring an obscenity case to trial. He did not do so, but the controversy helped make the book a bestseller.&lt;ref&gt;''Boston Globe'': [http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/02/17/blood_from_oil/ Jack Curtis, "Blood from oil," February 17, 2008], accessed September 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
The 2007 feature film ''[[There Will Be Blood]]'', directed by [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], is inspired by the novel, but the story is too different to be considered an adaptation.  Unlike the novel, ''There Will Be Blood'' focused on the father, with his son being a supporting character.  Paul Thomas Anderson said that he only incorporated the first 150 pages of the book into his film, so the rest of the film and novel are nearly entirely different.

Anderson based his composite lead character Daniel Plainview on [[Edward L. Doheny]] and several men. He was inspired by the oil museums in [[Kern County, California]] and the libraries and museums in the area around [[Silver City, New Mexico]], as well as the period photography, which played a large part in shaping his screenplay and the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Advanced Publicity: Press Release |title=''There Will Be Blood'': Production Notes |publisher=[[Paramount Vantage]] |url=http://adpub.paramountvantage.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Hirschberg, Lynn |date=November 11, 2007 |title=The New Frontier’s Man |newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Levy, Emanuel |title=There Will Be Blood by Paul Thomas Anderson |url=http://www.emanuellevy.com/search/details.cfm?id=8383 |publisher=Emanuel Levy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Open Access Same-Time Information System''' ('''OASIS'''), is an [[Internet]]-based system for obtaining services related to [[electric power transmission]] in [[North America]].  It is the primary means by which high-voltage transmission lines are reserved for moving wholesale quantities of electricity.  The OASIS concept was originally conceived with the [[Energy Policy Act of 1992]], and formalized in 1996 through [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) Orders 888&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/order888.asp|title=FERC: Landmark Orders - Order No. 888|website=www.ferc.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 889.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/order889.asp|title=FERC: Landmark Orders - Gas|website=www.ferc.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before OASIS==
[[Electric utility]] systems in North America developed over time as regulated [[monopoly|monopolies]], jurisdictional utilities given rights to own and operate transmission and [[Electricity distribution|distribution]] networks in a given geographical area along with the responsibility to serve all loads in that same area.  At first, utility companies generally served their own system load demand by building local power [[Electric generator|generation]] facilities within their systems.  Social, economic, and ecological influences later led to new arrangements where a utility company might enter into long-term power purchase or sale agreements with neighboring utility companies, or locate new generation facilities outside of their system and enter into long-term agreements for transmission rights to deliver that energy to their own system.  In the short-term world of day-to-day operations, utility companies would agree to "preschedule" (day ahead) or "real time" (same day or next hour) energy transactions with adjacent companies to supplement their own generation asset capabilities.

===Vertically Integrated Utilities===
As utility companies began integrating their operations in more complex ways with their neighbors, they evolved into a vertical organizational structure with three tiers: Generation, Transmission, and Scheduling.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  On a day-to-day or day-ahead operational level these functions might be performed by three or more people at large utilities, but might be combined into a single employee's job at a small utility.  The size of the back office support for each function varies greatly depending upon the size of the utility.

====Generation====
The generation group manages the maintenance and operations of generation assets, with an eye on the future regarding when, where and how much generation assets will need to be developed to keep up with future demand.

====Transmission====
The transmission group concerns itself with maintaining the high voltage transmission system and lower voltage distribution system.  As load demands increase or new generation assets come online in their systems, they upgrade existing facilities or construct new transmission corridors to maintain the reliable delivery of energy.

====Scheduling====
The scheduling group is responsible for ensuring that there is adequate power supply to meet the demand of the customer load on a day-to-day and hour-to-hour basis, and also for procuring resources to meet long term needs.  These resources can be procured through the generation group, or through purchases and sales with other companies.

===Internal Customers===
Unlike a typical residential or commercial/industrial customer, large bulk users of electricity such as mills, mines and large factories generally have the opportunity to negotiate the rates they will pay their supplier for electricity.  In some cases they might even have their own generation assets as well.  If they chose to use their supplier's generation instead of their own, they might also be required to pay a fee for the transmission to deliver it, since that transmission might be built specifically to serve their needs.  Fees for services provided by the transmission group were defined in a pro forma tariff, a document the transmission group supplied that detailed requirements and responsibilities for the purchaser and provider, and definitions and costs of the types of transmission services available.

The [[Energy Policy Act of 1992]] (EPAct) laid the initial foundation for the eventual [[deregulation]] of the North American electricity market.  This Act called for utility companies to allow external entities fair access to the electric transmission systems in North America.  The act's intent was to allow large customers (and in theory, every customer) to choose their electricity supplier and subsequently pay for the transmission to deliver it from the generation to serve their load.

Based on the premise that new generating facilities would be allowed fair access to their regional transmission system, and precipitated by the EPAct of 1992, construction of new independently owned generation assets began in response to the development of the North American [[electricity market]]. Recognizing competition was coming, electric utility companies began modifying their scheduling functions by forming affiliated Power Marketing departments.  Similarly, financial trading interests and existing energy companies (outside of electricity) saw the opportunities in the emerging electricity market and began to organize unaffiliated power marketing divisions.  With open access, anyone with the proper resources and/or creditworthiness could purchase the rights to generation, move it across the transmission network (provided adequate capacity was available), and deliver it to a place of higher demand.

Following passage of the EPAct of 1992, independent generation owner/operators (also called independent power producers or IPPs) and unaffiliated power marketers lodged frequent complaints with FERC about unfair treatment under the new open access requirements.  The complaints generally followed the same theme:  vertically integrated electric utility companies would favor their own affiliated power marketing division over external parties trying to move power on the system.  In many cases, the power marketers operated side by side with the transmission operators (or it might even be the same person) and there were no rules to prevent unfair treatment of external transmission system users.

==FERC Orders 888 and 889==
To protect and promote generation competition and also enforce fair treatment of external users of the transmission system, FERC issued Order 888 and Order 889 on April 24, 1996.  The EPAct of 1992 was the beginning of electric deregulation in North America, but Orders 888 and 889 marked the point where the trading of electricity gained a firm foothold.

===Order 888, the "Open Access" order===
Order 888's primary objective was to establish and promote competition in the generation market, by ensuring fair access and market treatment of transmission customers.  FERC outlined six points to accomplish this goal:
* Require all jurisdictional utilities (within the United States) to file an open-access transmission tariff (OATT)
* Require investor-owned utilities (IOU's) to functionally unbundle wholesale generation and power marketing from transmission services
* Create [[Independent System Operator|Independent System Operators (ISO's)]] and operating guidelines
* Encourage reciprocity for non-jurisdictional (i.e., municipalities and cooperatives) utilities&lt;ref&gt;16 U.S.C. 824(f)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allow utilities to recover stranded costs
* Identify ancillary services and comparable services to properly operate the bulk power system

One fairly immediate result of this order was the functional separation and isolation of the power schedulers and power marketers within vertically integrated utilities from their company's area of transmission operations.  Affiliated power marketers could no longer work alongside the transmission operators who were charged with treating them and external parties equally, and at the same time affiliated power marketers would no longer have any "inside information" on the availability of the transmission system nor the transactions being scheduled on it.

===Order 889, the "Standards of Conduct" order===
Order 889 went to great lengths to detail exactly how all participants in the electricity market should interact with transmission providers.  It laid out the structure and function of what became known as OASIS "nodes," which are secure, web-based interfaces to each transmission system's market offerings and transmission availability announcements.  Each OASIS node was to be the single point of information dissemination to the market as well as the customer portal for transmission service requests (TSR), even for affiliated power marketers wanting access to their own parent company's transmission.

==OASIS Nodes==
OASIS nodes{{Clarify|date=March 2009}} are entirely web-based, and public access is limited.  Power marketers that become signatories to a transmission provider's OATT gain more complete access so they can view existing transmission and service availability and existing service requests made by other parties.  There are also market observers who have read-only access, who may view activity but not request services.

Transmission facilities have power transfer limits that must be maintained to allow the power grid to operate reliably.  Transmission operators perform system studies in various future time frames to determine how much transfer capacity is required to serve their own "native load", and how much capacity must remain as a buffer to prevent unscheduled or accidental overflows that can damage high voltage equipment.  The difference between the capacity needed to serve load and to maintain safe flow margins can be made available for purchase on the OASIS node.

Unplanned outages and other system emergencies can adversely impact the total power transfer capability across transmission systems, and it sometimes becomes necessary for transmission providers to curtail power flows across the system by revoking transmission rights given to buyers on the OASIS.  Some transmission buyers are willing to pay higher rates to avoid having their transactions curtailed, and as such transmission companies offer different priorities of transmission service at varying rates.  The least expensive type of transmission is generally "non-firm" and purchased on an hour to hour basis.  Daily non-firm is a slightly higher priority (because the buyer committed to purchasing all day), and increments go up from there to weekly, monthly, seasonally, yearly, or longer with the cost for each also rising incrementally.  "Firm" transmission services are even more expensive, but are the last transactions to be curtailed.

Even before the appearance of the OASIS nodes, many groups of transmission owners had already turned over operational control of their collective bulk transmission systems to Independent System Operators of various forms.  These ISO's offered OASIS access to their collective systems very early on, so that it was often possible to make a single OASIS transmission service request that could cross multiple transmission systems.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Since the inception of OASIS, and under the prodding of FERC to move transmission assets under the control of ISO's, the number of OASIS nodes is decreasing as ISO's assume control of transmission systems and consolidate their related OASIS functions.

==OASIS impacts==
After the doors opened to allow power marketers to move their electricity purchases across multiple transmission systems, many transmission operators saw their transmission systems loaded to much higher levels.  Even though transmission services are generally obtained "point-to-point", in actuality power flows divide among numerous paths according to the properties of electricity and thus the actual energy flows follow the [[path of least resistance]].

A result of the long distance electricity transactions being scheduled was the impact of "loop flows" caused by energy flowing on these alternate paths.  [[Transmission system operator]]s were faced with a dilemma:  The problems were often being caused by external influences, and the only way available to them to reduce the stress on the transmission system was to curtail their own transmission sales.  This resulted in a loss of revenue and still did not always solve the overloading problems.

The [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] (NERC) stepped in to address this new problem that threatened the North American power grid by introducing the [[NERC Tag]]ging application.  NERC Tags captured entire transactions from beginning to end. This let them string together all the transmission legs obtained on various OASIS nodes, and then determine how the total schedule impacted transmission systems, and what priorities of transmission were used in the schedule. This let them determine which schedules should be curtailed to relieve loading on transmission systems.

NERC also assumed initial control of the Transmission System Information Networks (TSIN), a database of electric power system data. In 2012 the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB), an industry council, assumed responsibility &lt;ref&gt;https://www.naesb.org//pdf4/registry_transfer_update_080911.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; for TSIN.  It is now the "OATI Web Registry" and requires that users be registered. The registry is a web-based database containing a comprehensive listing of generation points, transmission facilities and delivery points as well as transmission and generation priority definitions with regard to the applications that use it (the various OASIS nodes as well as the NERC Tagging application).

The '''Organization of Petroleum Importing Countries ''' was a cartel (or a proposal for a cartel)  of countries that primarily consume petroleum, to counter the influence of [[OPEC]], the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary H. T. O'Kane "A Probabilistic Approach to the Causes of Coups d'Etat", ''British Journal of Political Science,'' Vol. 11, No. 3 (Jul., 1981), pp. 287-308 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/193491 Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Energy and the Balance of Payments", by Charles F. Stewart ''Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science" Vol. 31, No. 2, The National Energy Problem (Dec., 1973), pp. 137-147  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1173576 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in the early 1980s that [[Costa Rica]] had led the establishment of a group of countries under this name.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hallwood and Stuart Sinclair, "OPEC'S Developing Relationships with the Third World" ''International Affairs'', Vol. 58, No. 2 (Spring, 1982), pp. 271-286 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2617982 Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also calls in the early 21st century for an organization fulfilling such a role.&lt;ref&gt;''Fueling Asia’s growth: Collaboration in energy security '' by Deloitte's Global Energy &amp; Resources Group and Deloitte’s China Practice  [www.deloitte.com/dtt/cda/doc/content/E&amp;R-eng_sec.pdf Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was argued that it was in the interests of [[developing countries]]&lt;ref&gt;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=439680&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1306919&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1262716e&lt;/ref&gt; and that it would also act to the benefit of [[developed countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Jayanta Sen,  "Buyers' Cartel for Oil?

{{Infobox palladium}}
'''Palladium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Pd''' and atomic number 46. It is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by [[William Hyde Wollaston]]. He named it after the [[2 Pallas|asteroid Pallas]], which was itself named after the [[epithet]] of the Greek goddess [[Athena]], acquired by her when she slew [[Pallas (daughter of Triton)|Pallas]]. Palladium, [[platinum]], [[rhodium]], [[ruthenium]], [[iridium]] and [[osmium]] form a group of elements referred to as the [[platinum group]] metals (PGMs). These have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them.

More than half the supply of palladium and its [[Congener (chemistry)|congener]] platinum is used in [[catalytic converter]]s, which convert as much as 90% of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust ([[hydrocarbon]]s, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[nitrogen dioxide]]) into less noxious substances ([[nitrogen]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water vapor]]). Palladium is also used in electronics, [[dentistry]], [[medicine]], [[hydrogen purification]], chemical applications, groundwater treatment, and jewelry. Palladium is a key component of [[fuel cell]]s, which react hydrogen with oxygen to produce electricity, heat, and water.

[[Ore]] [[Deposit (geology)|deposits]] of palladium and other PGMs are rare. The most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the [[Bushveld Igneous Complex]] covering the [[Transvaal Basin]] in South Africa; the [[Stillwater igneous complex|Stillwater Complex]] in [[Montana]], United States; the [[Sudbury Basin]] and [[Thunder Bay District]] of [[Ontario]], Canada; and the [[Norilsk|Norilsk Complex]] in Russia. [[Recycling]] is also a source, mostly from scrapped catalytic converters. The numerous applications and limited supply sources result in considerable [[Palladium as an investment|investment]] interest.

==Characteristics==
Palladium belongs to [[group 10 element|group&amp;nbsp;10]] in the periodic table, but the configuration in the outermost electrons are in accordance with [[Hund's rule]].  Electrons in the s-shell migrate to fill the d orbitals because they have less energy.

Palladium is a soft silver-white metal that resembles platinum. It is the least dense and has the lowest [[melting point]] of the platinum group metals. It is soft and ductile when [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when cold-worked. Palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated [[nitric acid]], in hot, concentrated [[sulfuric acid]], and when finely ground, in [[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book|author=Hammond, C. R.|chapter=The Elements |title=Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|edition=81st|publisher=CRC press|isbn=978-0-8493-0485-9|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It dissolves readily at room temperature in [[aqua regia]].

Palladium does not react with [[oxygen]] at standard temperature (and thus does not tarnish in [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]). Palladium heated to 800&amp;nbsp;°C will produce a layer of palladium(II) oxide (PdO). It tarnishes lightly in a moist atmosphere containing [[sulfur]].{{clarify|reason=producing what compound?|date=May 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Craig|first1=Bruce D.|last2=Anderson |first2=David S. |title=Handbook of corrosion data |date=1995 |publisher=ASM International |isbn=978-0-87170-518-1|page=126 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KXwgAZJBWb0C&amp;pg=RA1-PT126|chapter= Atmospheric Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palladium films with defects produced by alpha particle bombardment at low temperature exhibit superconductivity having T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;=3.2 K.&lt;ref&gt;B. Strizker, Phys. Rev. Lett., 42, 1769 (1979).
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of palladium}}
Naturally occurring palladium is composed of seven [[isotope]]s, six of which are stable. The most stable [[radioisotope]]s are [[Palladium-107|&lt;sup&gt;107&lt;/sup&gt;Pd]] with a [[half-life]] of 6.5 million years (found in nature), [[Pd-103|&lt;sup&gt;103&lt;/sup&gt;Pd]] with 17 days, and &lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;Pd with 3.63 days. Eighteen other radioisotopes have been characterized with [[atomic weight]]s ranging from 90.94948(64) [[atomic mass unit|u]] (&lt;sup&gt;91&lt;/sup&gt;Pd) to 122.93426(64)&amp;nbsp;u (&lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;Pd).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=12 November 2009|url=http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Compositions/index.html|title= Atomic Weights and Isotopic Compositions for Palladium (NIST)}}&lt;/ref&gt; These have half-lives of less than thirty minutes, except &lt;sup&gt;101&lt;/sup&gt;Pd (half-life: 8.47 hours), &lt;sup&gt;109&lt;/sup&gt;Pd (half-life: 13.7 hours), and &lt;sup&gt;112&lt;/sup&gt;Pd (half-life: 21 hours).&lt;ref name="NUBASE"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| date = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.

For isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the most abundant stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Pd, the primary [[decay mode]] is [[electron capture]] with the primary [[decay product]] being rhodium. The primary mode of decay for those isotopes of Pd with atomic mass greater than 106 is [[beta decay]] with the primary product of this decay being [[silver]].&lt;ref name="NUBASE"/&gt;

==Compounds==
: ''{{Category see also|Palladium compounds}}''
Palladium compounds primarily exist in the 0 and +2 oxidation state.  Other less common states are also recognized. Generally the compounds of palladium are more similar to those of platinum than those of any other element.

===Palladium(II)===
Palladium(II) chloride is the principal starting material for other palladium compounds. It arises by the reaction of palladium with chlorine. It is used to prepare heterogeneous palladium catalysts such as palladium on barium sulfate, palladium on carbon, and palladium chloride on carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|title = Palladium Catalysts|author = Mozingo, Ralph |collvol = 3|collvolpages = 685|year = 1955|prep = cv3p0685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solutions of PdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in nitric acid react with [[acetic acid]] to give [[palladium(II) acetate]], also a versatile reagent.  PdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with ligands (L) to give square planar complexes of the type PdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. One example of such complexes is the [[benzonitrile]] derivative PdX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PhCN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title =Bis(Benzonitrile)Dichloro Complexes of Palladium and Platinum|pages =60–63|journal=[[Inorganic Syntheses]]|volume= 28|doi =10.1002/9780470132593.ch13|date=1990|first1=Gordon K.|last1=Anderson|first2=Minren|last2=Lin|last3=Sen|first3= Ayusman|last4 =Gretz|first4=Efi|series =Inorganic Syntheses|isbn =978-0-470-13259-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1134/S1070328408110110 |title=Palladium complexes based on optically active terpene derivatives of ethylenediamine |journal=Russian Journal of Coordination Chemistry |volume=34 |issue=11 |pages=855–857 |year=2008 |last1=Zalevskaya |first1=O.

==History==
[[File:Wollaston William Hyde Jackson color.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[William Hyde Wollaston]]]]
William Hyde Wollaston noted the [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery]] of a new noble metal in July 1802 in his lab-book and named it palladium in August of the same year. Wollaston purified enough of the material and offered it, without naming the discoverer, in a small shop in [[Soho]] in April 1803. After harsh criticism from [[Richard Chenevix (chemist)|Richard Chenevix]] that palladium is an alloy of platinum and mercury, Wollaston anonymously offered a reward of 20 British pounds for 20 grains of synthetic palladium ''alloy''.&lt;ref name="contr"&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1080/00033797800200431|title = The Wollaston/Chenevix controversy over the elemental nature of palladium: A curious episode in the history of chemistry|date = 1978|last1 = Usselman|first1 = Melvyn|journal = Annals of Science|volume = 35|issue = 6|pages = 551–579}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chenevix received the [[Copley Medal]] in 1803 after he published his experiments on palladium.

It was named by Wollaston in 1802 after the asteroid [[2 Pallas]], which had been discovered two months earlier.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Wollaston found palladium in crude platinum ore from [[South America]] by dissolving the ore in [[aqua regia]], neutralizing the solution with [[sodium hydroxide]], and precipitating platinum as [[ammonium chloroplatinate]] with [[ammonium chloride]]. He added [[mercuric cyanide]] to form the compound [[palladium(II) cyanide]], which was heated to extract palladium metal.&lt;ref name="Disco"/&gt;

[[Palladium chloride]] was at one time prescribed as a [[tuberculosis]] treatment at the rate of 0.065&amp;nbsp;g per day (approximately one milligram per kilogram of body weight). This treatment had many negative [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]], and was later replaced by more effective drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Art of Meeting Palladium Specifications in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Produced by Pd-Catalyzed Reactions|first=Christine E. |last=Garrett|author2=Prasad, Kapa|journal= Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis|volume=346 |issue=8 |date=2004 |pages=889–900 |doi=10.1002/adsc.200404071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World demand for palladium increased from 100 tons in 1990 to nearly 300&amp;nbsp;tons in 2000.

A 2008 study showed that palladium is an effective catalyst for carbon-fluoride bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Chemical &amp; Engineering News|volume = 86|issue = 35|date = 2008|title = Palladium's Hidden Talent|pages = 53–56|first =Carmen|last = Drahl|doi =10.1021/cen-v086n035.p053}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Kumada Catalytic Cycle.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Catalytic cycle for Kumada cross coupling reaction, which is widely used in the synthesis of fine chemicals.]]

Palladium catalysis is primarily employed in organic chemistry and industrial applications, although its use is growing as a tool for [[synthetic biology]]; in 2017, effective ''in vivo'' catalytic activity of palladium [[nanoparticles]] was demonstrated in mammals to treat disease.&lt;ref name="pmid28699627"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms15906 |pmid=28699627 |pmc=5510178 |title=Nano-palladium is a cellular catalyst for in vivo chemistry |journal=Nature Communications |volume=8 |pages=15906 |year=2017 |last1=Miller |first1=Miles A |last2=Askevold |first2=Bjorn |last3=Mikula |first3=Hannes |last4=Kohler |first4=Rainer H |last5=Pirovich |first5=David |last6=Weissleder |first6=Ralph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewelry===

Palladium has been used as a [[precious metal]] in jewelry since 1939 as an alternative to platinum in the alloys called "[[Colored gold#White gold|white gold]]", where the naturally white color of palladium does not require [[Plating#Rhodium plating|rhodium plating]]. Palladium is much less dense than platinum. Similar to gold, palladium can be beaten into [[Metal leaf|leaf]] as thin as 100&amp;nbsp;nm ({{frac|1|250,000}}&amp;nbsp;in).&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Unlike platinum, palladium may discolor at temperatures above {{convert|400|C|F}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Dinesh C. |last=Gupta|author2=Langer, Paul H. |author3=ASTM Committee F-1 on Electronics|title=Emerging semiconductor technology: a symposium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-a9LvarW-8C&amp;pg=PA273|date=1987|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=978-0-8031-0459-4|pages=273–}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is relatively brittle.{{Clarify|reason=Is it relatively brittle at those temperatures?|date=July 2016}}

Palladium is one of the three most popular alloying metals in white gold ([[nickel]] and silver can also be used).&lt;ref name=unctad&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]]|url = http://www.unctad.org/infocomm/anglais/palladium/uses.htm|title = Palladium|accessdate =5 February 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061206003556/http://www.unctad.org/infocomm/anglais/palladium/uses.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate = 6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palladium-gold is more expensive than nickel-gold, but seldom causes allergic reactions (though certain cross-allergies with nickel may occur).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hindsen |first1=M. |last2=Spiren |first2=A. |last3=Bruze |first3=M. |title=Cross-reactivity between nickel and palladium demonstrated by systemic administration of nickel |journal=Contact Dermatitis |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=2–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15982224 |doi=10.1111/j.0105-1873.2005.00577.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When platinum became a strategic resource during World War II, many jewelry bands were made out of palladium. Up to as recently as September 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Johnson Matthey |title=Daily Metal Prices: September 2001 |url=http://www.platinum.matthey.com/prices/September2001.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029170752/http://www.platinum.matthey.com/prices/September2001.php |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; palladium was more expensive than platinum and rarely used in jewelry because of the technical difficulty of [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]]. Currently, the casting problem has been resolved and use in jewelry has increased because platinum has increased in price while palladium decreased.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news|last = Holmes |first = E.|title = Palladium, Platinum's Cheaper Sister, Makes a Bid for Love|publisher = [[Wall Street Journal]] (Eastern edition)|date = 13 February 2007|pages = B.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2004, the principal use of palladium in jewelry was the manufacture of white gold. In early 2004, when gold and platinum prices rose steeply, China began fabricating volumes of palladium jewelry, consuming 37 [[tonne]]s in 2005. Changes in the relative price of platinum after 2008 lowered demand for palladium to 17.4 tonnes in 2009.&lt;ref name="USGS09YB"&gt;{{cite web|publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]]|date=January 2007|title=Platinum-Group Metals|work=Mineral Yearbook 2009|url= http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/platinum/myb1-2009-plati.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USGS06YB"&gt;{{cite web|publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]]|date=January 2007|title=Platinum-Group Metals|work=Mineral Yearbook 2006|url= http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/platinum/myb1-2006-plati.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, [[hallmark]]s for palladium were introduced by assay offices in the United Kingdom, and hallmarking became mandatory for all jewelry advertising pure or alloyed palladium. Articles can be marked as 500, 950, or 999 parts of palladium per thousand of the alloy.
&lt;!-- Johnson Matthey estimated that in 2004, with the introduction of palladium jewelry in China, demand for palladium for jewelry fabrication was {{convert|920,000|ozt|MT}}, or approximately 14% of the total palladium demand for 2004&amp;nbsp;— an increase of almost {{convert|700,000|ozt|MT}} from the previous year. This growth continued during 2005, with estimated worldwide jewelry demand for palladium of about {{convert|1,400,000|ozt|MT}} 1.4&amp;nbsp;million ounces (44&amp;nbsp;t), or almost 21% of net palladium supply, again with most of the demand centered in China. 37,000&amp;nbsp;kg in 2005 15,500 (2007) 20,200 (2008) 17,400 (2009) --&gt;

[[Fountain pen]] [[nib (pen)|nibs]] made from [[gold]] are sometimes plated with palladium when a silver (rather than gold) appearance is desired. [[Sheaffer]] has used palladium plating for decades, either as an accent on otherwise gold nibs or covering the gold completely.

===Photography===
In the [[platinotype]] printing process, photographers make fine-art black-and-white prints using platinum or palladium salts. Often used with platinum, palladium provides an alternative to silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Mike|last = Ware|title = Book Review of : Photography in Platinum and Palladium|journal = Platinum Metals Review|volume = 49|issue = 4|pages = 190–195|date = 2005|doi = 10.1595/147106705X70291}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
This is very minimal application and is not widely adopted

===Art===
Palladium leaf is one of several alternatives to [[silver]] leaf used in [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]]. The use of silver leaf is problematic because it tarnishes quickly, dulling the appearance and requiring constant cleaning. Palladium is a suitable substitute owing to its resistance to tarnishing. [[Aluminium]] leaf is another inexpensive alternative, but aluminium is much more difficult to work than gold or silver and results in less-than-optimal results when employing traditional metal leafing techniques, so palladium leaf is considered the best substitute despite its considerable cost. Platinum leaf may be used to the same effect as silver leaf with similar working properties, but it is not as commercially available on demand in leaf form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Margaret|last = Morgan|title = The Bible of Illuminated Letters|publisher = Barron's Educational Series|isbn = 978-0-7641-5820-9|page = 50|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = [[Theodore Gray]]|title = Palladium Leaf|url = http://www.theodoregray.com/PeriodicTable/Samples/046.6/index.s12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
===Cold fusion===
{{Main|Cold fusion}}
Palladium plays an important role in the ongoing research into cold-fusion energy.

===Super tough metallic glass===
Research is being done to develop metallic glass as a microalloy featuring palladium, a metal with a high "bulk-to-shear" stiffness ratio that counteracts the intrinsic brittleness of glassy materials. The initial samples of the new metallic glass were microalloys of palladium with [[phosphorous]], [[silicon]] and [[germanium]] that yielded glass rods approximately one millimeter in diameter. Adding [[silver]] to the mix enabled the Cal Tech researchers to expand the thickness of the glass rods to six millimeters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scientificcomputing.com/news/2011/01/new-glass-stronger-any-known-material |title=New Glass Stronger than Any Known Material |date=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palladium is a metal with low toxicity. It is poorly absorbed by the [[human body]] when [[ingested]]. Plants such as the [[water hyacinth]] are killed by low levels of palladium salts, but most other plants tolerate it, although tests show that, at levels above 0.0003%, growth is affected. High doses of palladium could be poisonous; tests on [[rodents]] suggest it may be [[carcinogenic]], though no clear evidence indicates the element harms humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = John|last = Emsley|title = Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|publisher = Oxford University Press|isbn = 978-0-19-960563-7|pages = 384, 387|date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
Like other [[platinum-group metal]]s, bulk Pd is quite inert. Although [[contact dermatitis]] has been reported, data on the effects are limited.

Some palladium is emitted with the exhaust gases of cars with [[catalytic converter]]s. Between 4 and 108&amp;nbsp;ng/km of palladium particulate is released by such cars, while the total uptake from food is estimated to be less than 2&amp;nbsp;µg per person a day. The second possible source of palladium is dental restoration, from which the uptake of palladium is estimated to be less than 15&amp;nbsp;µg per person per day. People working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably greater uptake. For soluble compounds such as [[palladium chloride]], 99% is eliminated from the body within 3 days.&lt;ref name="Kiel" /&gt;

The [[median lethal dose]] (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of soluble palladium compounds in mice is 200&amp;nbsp;mg/kg for [[oral administration|oral]] and 5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg for [[intravenous administration]].&lt;ref name="Kiel"/&gt;

A '''phosphor''', most generally, is a substance that exhibits the [[optical phenomenon|phenomenon]] of [[luminescence]]. Somewhat confusingly, this includes both [[Phosphorescence|phosphorescent]] materials, which show a slow decay in brightness (&gt; 1&amp;nbsp;ms), and [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] materials, where the emission decay takes place over tens of nanoseconds. Phosphorescent materials are known for their use in radar screens and glow-in-the-dark materials, whereas fluorescent materials are common in [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) and plasma video display screens, [[fluorescent light]]s, sensors, and white [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s.

Phosphors are often [[transition-metal]] compounds or [[rare-earth]] compounds of various types. The most common uses of phosphors are in CRT displays and fluorescent lights. CRT phosphors were standardized beginning around [[World War II]] and designated by the letter "P" followed by a number.

[[Phosphorus]], the chemical element named for its light-emitting behavior, emits light due to [[chemiluminescence]], not phosphorescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =Emsley, John|year = 2000|title = The Shocking History of Phosphorus |location= London|publisher =Macmillan|isbn=0-330-39005-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
A material can emit light either through [[incandescence]], where all atoms radiate, or by [[luminescence]], where only a small fraction of atoms, called ''emission centers'' or ''luminescence centers'', emit light. In inorganic phosphors, these inhomogeneities in the crystal structure are created usually by addition of a trace amount of [[dopant]]s, impurities called ''[[activator (phosphor)|activators]]''. (In rare cases [[dislocation]]s or other [[crystal defect]]s can play the role of the impurity.) The wavelength emitted by the emission center is dependent on the atom itself and on the surrounding crystal structure.

The scintillation process in inorganic materials is due to the [[electronic band structure]] found in the [[crystal]]s. An incoming particle can excite an electron from the [[valence band]] to either the [[conduction band]] or the [[exciton]] band (located just below the conduction band and separated from the valence band by an [[energy gap]]). This leaves an associated [[electron hole|hole]] behind, in the valence band. Impurities create electronic levels in the [[forbidden gap]]. The excitons are loosely bound [[electron–hole pair]]s that wander through the [[crystal lattice]] until they are captured as a whole by impurity centers. The latter then rapidly de-excite by emitting scintillation light (fast component). In case of inorganic [[scintillator]]s, the activator impurities are typically chosen so that the emitted light is in the visible range or [[near ultraviolet|near-UV]], where [[photomultiplier]]s are effective. The holes associated with electrons in the conduction band are independent from the latter. Those holes and electrons are captured successively by impurity centers exciting certain [[metastable state]]s not accessible to the excitons. The delayed de-excitation of those metastable impurity states, slowed down by reliance on the low-probability [[forbidden mechanism]], again results in light emission (slow component).

===Phosphor degradation===
Many phosphors tend to lose efficiency gradually by several mechanisms. The activators can undergo change of [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] (usually [[oxidation]]), the [[crystal lattice]] degrades, atoms – often the activators – diffuse through the material, the surface undergoes chemical reactions with the environment with consequent loss of efficiency or buildup of a layer absorbing either the exciting or the radiated energy, etc.

The degradation of electroluminescent devices depends on frequency of driving current, the luminance level, and temperature; moisture impairs phosphor lifetime very noticeably as well.

Harder, high-melting, water-insoluble materials display lower tendency to lose luminescence under operation.&lt;ref name="advelectr"/&gt;

* ZnS-based phosphors in [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]s and [[field emission display|FED]]s degrade by surface excitation, coulombic damage, build-up of electric charge, and thermal quenching.

The electrons dissociate impurities in the environment, the [[reactive oxygen species]] then attack the surface and form [[carbon monoxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]] with traces of [[carbon]], and nonradiative [[zinc oxide]] and [[zinc sulfate]] on the surface; the reactive [[hydrogen]] removes [[sulfur]] from the surface as [[hydrogen sulfide]], forming nonradiative layer of metallic [[zinc]]. Sulfur can be also removed as [[sulfur oxide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lakshmanan, pp. 51, 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduced metal can be observed as a visible darkening of the phosphor layer. The darkening (and the brightness loss) is proportional to the phosphor's exposure to electrons and can be observed on some CRT screens that displayed the same image (e.g. a terminal login screen) for prolonged periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tubedevices.com/alek/pwl/luminofory/luminofory.ppt |title=PPT presentation in Polish (Link to achieved version; Original site isn't available) |publisher=Tubedevices.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228072818/http://tubedevices.com/alek/pwl/luminofory/luminofory.ppt |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
Phosphors are usually made from a suitable host material with an added [[activator (phosphor)|activator]]. The best known type is a copper-activated zinc sulfide and the silver-activated zinc sulfide (''zinc sulfide silver'').

The host materials are typically [[oxide]]s, [[nitride]]s and oxynitrides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Silicon-based oxynitride and nitride phosphors for white LEDs—A review|journal = Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater. |volume =8| year =2007|page = 588|doi= 10.1016/j.stam.2007.08.005|author =Xie, Rong-Jun| first2 =Naoto| last2 =Hirosaki|bibcode = 2007STAdM...8..588X| issue =7–8 }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sulfide]]s, [[selenide]]s, [[halide]]s or [[silicate]]s of [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], [[manganese]], [[aluminium]], [[silicon]], or various [[rare-earth metal]]s. The activators prolong the emission time (afterglow). In turn, other materials (such as [[nickel]]) can be used to quench the afterglow and shorten the decay part of the phosphor emission characteristics.

Many phosphor powders are produced in low-temperature processes, such as [[sol-gel]] and usually require post-annealing at temperatures of ~1000&amp;nbsp;°C, which is undesirable for many applications. However, proper optimization of the growth process allows to avoid the annealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Fine yellow α-SiAlON:Eu phosphors for white LEDs prepared by the gas-reduction–nitridation method|journal = Sci.

Phosphors used for [[fluorescent lamp]]s require a multi-step production process, with details that vary depending on the particular phosphor. Bulk material must be milled to obtain a desired particle size range, since large particles produce a poor-quality lamp coating, and small particles produce less light and degrade more quickly. During the [[pottery firing|firing]] of the phosphor, process conditions must be controlled to prevent oxidation of the phosphor activators or [[contamination]] from the process vessels. After milling the phosphor may be washed to remove minor excess of activator elements. Volatile elements must not be allowed to escape during processing. Lamp manufacturers have changed composition of phosphors to eliminate some toxic elements, such as [[beryllium]], [[cadmium]], or [[thallium]], formerly used.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, Raymond and Sell, Heinz (2001) ''Revolution in lamps: a chronicle of 50 years of progress'', 2nd ed. The Fairmont Press. {{ISBN|0-88173-378-4}}. Chapter 5 extensively discusses history, application and manufacturing of phosphors for lamps.&lt;/ref&gt;

The commonly quoted parameters for phosphors are the [[wavelength]] of emission maximum (in nanometers, or alternatively [[color temperature]] in [[kelvin]]s for white blends), the peak width (in nanometers at 50% of intensity), and decay time (in seconds).

==Applications==

===Lighting===
Phosphor layers provide most of the light produced by [[fluorescent lamp]]s, and are also used to improve the balance of light produced by [[metal halide lamp]]s.  Various [[neon sign]]s use phosphor layers to produce different colors of light. [[Electroluminescent display]]s found, for example, in aircraft instrument panels, use a phosphor layer to produce glare-free illumination or as numeric and graphic display devices. White [[LED]] lamps consist of a blue or ultra-violet emitter with a phosphor coating that emits at longer wavelengths, giving a full spectrum of visible light. Unfocused and undeflected [[cathode ray tube]]s were used as [[Strobe light|stroboscope lamps]] since 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/074/c/CL60.pdf |publisher=[[Ferranti]], Ltd. |title=''Vacuum light sources — High speed stroboscopic light sources'' data sheet |date=August 1958 |format=PDF |accessdate=7 May 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920125303/http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/074/c/CL60.pdf |archivedate=20 September 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phosphor thermometry===
{{main|Phosphor thermometry}}
[[Phosphor thermometry]] is a temperature measurement approach that uses the temperature dependence of certain phosphors. For this, a phosphor coating is applied to a surface of interest and, usually, the decay time is the emission parameter that indicates temperature. Because the illumination and detection optics can be situated remotely, the method may be used for moving surfaces such as high speed motor surfaces. Also, phosphor may be applied to the end of an optical fiber as an optical analog of a thermocouple.

===Glow-in-the-dark toys===
*[[Calcium sulfide]] with [[strontium sulfide]] with [[bismuth]] as activator, (Ca,Sr)S:Bi, yields blue light with glow times up to 12 hours, red and orange are modifications of the zinc sulfide formula. Red color can be obtained from strontium sulfide.
*[[Zinc sulfide]] with about 5 ppm of a [[copper]] activator is the most common phosphor for the glow-in-the-dark toys and items. It is also called '''GS''' phosphor.
*Mix of zinc sulfide and [[cadmium sulfide]] emit color depending on their ratio; increasing of the CdS content shifts the output color towards longer wavelengths; its persistence ranges between 1–10 hours.
*[[Strontium aluminate]] activated by [[europium]], SrAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu(II):Dy(III), is a newer material with higher brightness and significantly longer glow persistence; it produces green and aqua hues, where green gives the highest brightness and aqua the longest glow time. SrAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu:Dy is about 10 times brighter, 10 times longer glowing, and 10 times more expensive than ZnS:Cu. The excitation wavelengths for strontium aluminate range from 200 to 450&amp;nbsp;nm. The wavelength for its green formulation is 520&amp;nbsp;nm, its blue-green version emits at 505&amp;nbsp;nm, and the blue one emits at 490&amp;nbsp;nm. Colors with longer wavelengths can be obtained from the strontium aluminate as well, though for the price of some loss of brightness.

In these applications, the phosphor is directly added to the [[plastic]] used to mold the toys, or mixed with a binder for use as paints.

ZnS:Cu phosphor is used in glow-in-the-dark cosmetic creams frequently used for [[Halloween]] [[make-up]]s.
Generally, the persistence of the phosphor increases as the wavelength increases. 
See also [[lightstick]] for [[chemiluminescence]]-based glowing items.

===Postage stamps===
[[Phosphor banded stamp]]s first appeared in 1959 as guides for machines to sort mail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamp-shop.com/dummies/see-phosphor.html SEEING PHOSPHOR BANDS on U.K. STAMPS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019005044/http://www.stamp-shop.com/dummies/see-phosphor.html |date=2015-10-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Around the world many varieties exist with different amounts of banding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbmachins.co.uk/html/phosphor_bands.html Phosphor Bands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317231538/http://gbmachins.co.uk/html/phosphor_bands.html |date=2017-03-17 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Postage stamp]]s are sometimes collected by whether or not they are [[Tagging (stamp)|"tagged"]] with phosphor (or printed on [[luminescent]] paper).

===Radioluminescence===
{{main|Radioluminescence}}
Zinc sulfide phosphors are used with [[radioactive]] materials, where the phosphor was excited by the alpha- and beta-decaying isotopes, to create luminescent paint for dials of [[watch]]es and instruments ([[radium dials]]). Between 1913 and 1950 radium-228 and radium-226 were used to activate a phosphor made of [[silver]] [[doped]] zinc sulfide (ZnS:Ag), which gave a greenish glow. The phosphor is not suitable to be used in layers thicker than 25&amp;nbsp;mg/cm², as the self-absorption of the light then becomes a problem. Furthermore, zinc sulfide undergoes degradation of its crystal lattice structure, leading to gradual loss of brightness significantly faster than the depletion of radium. ZnS:Ag coated [[spinthariscope]] screens were used by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in his experiments discovering [[atomic nucleus]].

[[Copper]] doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu) is the most common phosphor used and yields blue-green light. Copper and [[magnesium]] doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu,Mg) yields yellow-orange light.

[[Tritium]] is also used as a source of radiation in various products utilizing [[tritium illumination]].

===Electroluminescence===
{{main|Electroluminescence}}
[[Electroluminescence]] can be exploited in light sources. Such sources typically emit from a large area, which makes them suitable for backlights of LCD displays. The excitation of the phosphor is usually achieved by application of high-intensity [[electric field]], usually with suitable frequency. Current electroluminescent light sources tend to degrade with use, resulting in their relatively short operation lifetimes.

ZnS:Cu was the first formulation successfully displaying electroluminescence, tested at 1936 by [[Georges Destriau]] in Madame Marie Curie laboratories in Paris.

Powder or AC electroluminescence is found in a variety of backlight and night light applications.  Several groups offer branded EL offerings (e.g. '''IndiGlo''' used in some Timex watches) or "Lighttape", another trade name of an electroluminescent material, used in electroluminescent [[light strips]].  The Apollo space program is often credited with being the first significant use of EL for backlights and lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7290Lighting.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221230335/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7290Lighting.pdf |archivedate=2016-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White LEDs===
White [[light-emitting diode]]s are usually blue [[InGaN]] LEDs with a coating of a suitable material. [[Cerium]](III)-doped [[YAG]] ('''YAG:Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;''', or '''Y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;:Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;''') is often used; it absorbs the light from the blue LED and emits in a broad range from greenish to reddish, with most of output in yellow. This yellow emission combined with the remaining blue emission gives the “white” light, which can be adjusted to color temperature as warm (yellowish) or cold (blueish) white. The pale yellow emission of the Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;:YAG can be tuned by substituting the cerium with other rare-earth elements such as [[terbium]] and [[gadolinium]] and can even be further adjusted by substituting some or all of the aluminium in the YAG with gallium. However, this process is not one of phosphorescence. The yellow light is produced by a process known as [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]], the complete absence of an afterglow being one of the characteristics of the process.

Some [[rare-earth]]-[[doped]] [[Sialon]]s are [[photoluminescent]] and can serve as phosphors. [[Europium]](II)-doped β-SiAlON absorbs in [[ultraviolet]] and [[visible light]] spectrum and emits intense broadband visible emission. Its luminance and color does not change significantly with temperature, due to the temperature-stable crystal structure. It has a great potential as a green down-conversion phosphor for white [[LED]]s; a yellow variant also exists. For white LEDs, a blue LED is used with a yellow phosphor, or with a green and yellow SiAlON phosphor and a red CaAlSiN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based (CASN) phosphor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.science24.com/paper/15977|title=Luminescence and temperature dependency of β-SiAlON phosphor|author=Youn-Gon Park|journal=Samsung Electro Mechanics Co|display-authors=etal|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412152349/http://www.science24.com/paper/15977|archivedate=2010-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090915/175305/|title=Sharp to Employ White LED Using Sialon|date=Sep 15, 2009|author=Hideyoshi Kume, Nikkei Electronics|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223124648/http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090915/175305/|archivedate=2012-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200602/000020060205A1031052.php|title=New sialon phosphors and white LEDs|author=Naoto, Hirosaki|journal=Oyo Butsuri|volume=74|issue=11|page=1449|year=2005|display-authors=etal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404151444/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200602/000020060205A1031052.php|archivedate=2010-04-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White LEDs can also be made by coating near ultraviolet (NUV) emitting LEDs with a mixture of high efficiency europium based red and blue emitting phosphors plus green emitting copper and aluminium doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu,Al). This is a method analogous to the way [[fluorescent lamp]]s work.

Some newer white LEDs use a yellow and blue emitter in series, to approximate white; this technology is used in some Motorola phones such as the Blackberry as well as LED lighting and the original version stacked emitters by using GaN on SiC on InGaP but was later found to fracture at higher drive currents.

Many white LEDs used in general lighting systems can be used for data transfer, for example, in systems that modulate the LED to act as a [[beacon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/11192/chastotnye_harakteristiki_sovremennyh_svetodiodnyh_lyuminofornyh_materialov.htm|title=Frequency characteristics of modern LED phosphor materials|author=Fudin, M.S.|journal=Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics|volume=14|issue=6|page=71|year=2014|display-authors=etal|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626162616/http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/11192/chastotnye_harakteristiki_sovremennyh_svetodiodnyh_lyuminofornyh_materialov.htm|archivedate=2015-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cathode ray tubes===&lt;!-- This section is linked from Cathode ray tube --&gt;
[[File:CRT phosphors.png|thumb|right|400px|Spectra of constituent blue, green and red phosphors in a common cathode ray tube.]]

[[Cathode ray tube]]s produce signal-generated light patterns in a (typically) round or rectangular format. Bulky CRTs were used in the black-and-white household television ("TV") sets that became popular in the 1950s, as well as first-generation, tube-based color TVs, and most earlier computer monitors. CRTs have also been widely used in scientific and engineering instrumentation, such as [[oscilloscope]]s, usually with a single phosphor color, typically green. Phosphors for such applications may have long afterglow, for increased image persistence.

The phosphors can be deposited as either [[thin film]], or as discrete particles, a powder bound to the surface. Thin films have better lifetime and better resolution, but provide less bright and less efficient image than powder ones. This is caused by multiple internal reflections in the thin film, scattering the emitted light.

'''White''' (in black-and-white): The mix of zinc cadmium sulfide and zinc sulfide silver, the ZnS:Ag+(Zn,Cd)S:Ag is the white '''P4''' phosphor used in black and white television CRTs. Mixes of yellow and blue phosphors are usual. Mixes of red, green and blue, or a single white phosphor, can also be encountered.

'''Red:''' [[Yttrium]] [[oxide]]-[[sulfide]] activated with europium is used as the red phosphor in color CRTs. The development of color TV took a long time due to the search for a red phosphor. The first red emitting rare-earth phosphor, YVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, was introduced by Levine and Palilla as a primary color in television in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1063/1.1723611| title = A new, highly efficient red-emitting cathodoluminescent phosphor (YVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu) for color television| year = 1964|author = Levine, Albert K.| journal = Applied Physics Letters| volume = 5|page = 118| first2 = Frank C.| last2 = Palilla|bibcode = 1964ApPhL...5..118L| issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In single crystal form, it was used as an excellent polarizer and laser material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1063/1.98500| title = Highly efficient Nd:YVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; diode-laser end-pumped laser| year = 1987|author = Fields, R.

'''Yellow:''' When mixed with [[cadmium sulfide]], the resulting '''zinc cadmium sulfide''' (Zn,Cd)S:Ag, provides strong yellow light.

'''Green:''' Combination of zinc sulfide with [[copper]], the '''P31''' phosphor or ZnS:Cu, provides green light peaking at 531&amp;nbsp;nm, with long glow.

'''Blue:''' Combination of zinc sulfide with few ppm of [[silver]], the ZnS:Ag, when excited by electrons, provides strong blue glow with maximum at 450&amp;nbsp;nm, with short afterglow with 200 nanosecond duration. It is known as the '''P22B''' phosphor. This material, '''zinc sulfide silver''', is still one of the most efficient phosphors in cathode ray tubes. It is used as a blue phosphor in color CRTs.

The phosphors are usually poor electrical conductors. This may lead to deposition of residual charge on the screen, effectively decreasing the energy of the impacting electrons due to electrostatic repulsion (an effect known as "sticking"). To eliminate this, a thin layer of aluminium (about 100&amp;nbsp;nm) is deposited over the phosphors, usually by vacuum evaporation, and connected to the conductive layer inside the tube. This layer also reflects the phosphor light to the desired direction, and protects the phosphor from ion bombardment resulting from an imperfect vacuum.

To reduce the image degradation by reflection of ambient light, [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]] can be increased by several methods. In addition to black masking of unused areas of screen, the phosphor particles in color screens are coated with pigments of matching color. For example, the red phosphors are coated with [[ferric oxide]] (replacing earlier Cd(S,Se) due to cadmium toxicity), blue phosphors can be coated with marine blue ([[cobalt(II) oxide|CoO]]·''n''[[alumina|{{chem|Al|2|O|3}}]]) or [[ultramarine]] ({{chem|Na|8|Al|6|Si|6|O|24|S|2}}). Green phosphors based on ZnS:Cu do not have to be coated due to their own yellowish color.&lt;ref name="advelectr"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter W. Hawkes |title=Advances in electronics and electron physics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FE_Hvcbkpa4C&amp;pg=PA350 |accessdate=9 January 2012 |date=1 October 1990 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-014679-6 |pages=350–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Black-and-white television CRTs====
The black-and-white television screens require an emission color close to white. Usually, a combination of phosphors is employed.

The most common combination is ZnS:Ag+(Zn,Cd)S:Cu,Al (blue+yellow). Other ones are ZnS:Ag+(Zn,Cd)S:Ag (blue+yellow), and ZnS:Ag+ZnS:Cu,Al+Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S:Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (blue + green + red – does not contain cadmium and has poor efficiency). The color tone can be adjusted by the ratios of the components.

As the compositions contain discrete grains of different phosphors, they produce image that may not be entirely smooth. A single, white-emitting phosphor, (Zn,Cd)S:Ag,Au,Al overcomes this obstacle. Due to its low efficiency, it is used only on very small screens.

The screens are typically covered with phosphor using sedimentation coating, where particles [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in a solution are let to settle on the surface.&lt;ref name="lumdisp"&gt;Lakshmanan, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reduced-palette color CRTs====
For displaying of a limited palette of colors, there are a few options.

In [[penetron|'''beam penetration tubes''']], different color phosphors are layered and separated with dielectric material. The acceleration voltage is used to determine the energy of the electrons; lower-energy ones are absorbed in the top layer of the phosphor, while some of the higher-energy ones shoot through and are absorbed in the lower layer. So either the first color or a mixture of the first and second color is shown. With a display with red outer layer and green inner layer, the manipulation of accelerating voltage can produce a continuum of colors from red through orange and yellow to green.

Another method is using a mixture of two phosphors with different characteristics. The brightness of one is linearly dependent on electron flux, while the other one's brightness saturates at higher fluxes—the phosphor does not emit any more light regardless of how many more electrons impact it. At low electron flux, both phosphors emit together; at higher fluxes, the luminous contribution of the nonsaturating phosphor prevails, changing the combined color.&lt;ref name="lumdisp"/&gt;

Such displays can have high resolution, due to absence of two-dimensional structuring of RGB CRT phosphors. Their color palette is, however, very limited. They were used e.g. in some older military radar displays.

====Color television CRTs====
The phosphors in color CRTs need higher contrast and resolution than the black-and-white ones. The energy density of the electron beam is about 100 times greater than in black-and-white CRTs; the electron spot is focused to about 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm diameter instead of about 0.6&amp;nbsp;mm diameter of the black-and-white CRTs. Effects related to electron irradiation degradation are therefore more pronounced.

Color CRTs require three different phosphors, emitting in red, green and blue, patterned on the screen. Three separate electron guns are used for color production.

The composition of the phosphors changed over time, as better phosphors were developed and as environmental concerns led to lowering the content of cadmium and later abandoning it entirely. The (Zn,Cd)S:Ag,Cl was replaced with (Zn,Cd)S:Cu,Al with lower cadmium/zinc ratio, and then with cadmium-free ZnS:Cu,Al.

The blue phosphor stayed generally unchanged, a silver-doped zinc sulfide. The green phosphor initially used manganese-doped zinc silicate, then evolved through silver-activated cadmium-zinc sulfide, to lower-cadmium copper-aluminium activated formula, and then to cadmium-free version of the same. The red phosphor saw the most changes; it was originally manganese-activated zinc phosphate, then a silver-activated cadmium-zinc sulfide, then the europium(III) activated phosphors appeared; first in an [[yttrium vanadate]] matrix, then in [[yttrium oxide]] and currently in [[yttrium oxysulfide]]. The evolution of the phosphors was therefore:
* ZnS:Ag – Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Mn – Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:Mn
* ZnS:Ag – (Zn,Cd)S:Ag – (Zn,Cd)S:Ag
* ZnS:Ag – (Zn,Cd)S:Ag – YVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;
* ZnS:Ag – (Zn,Cd)S:Cu,Al – Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S:Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; or Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;
* ZnS:Ag – ZnS:Cu,Al or ZnS:Au,Cu,Al – Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S:Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="lumdisp"/&gt;

====Projection televisions====
For [[projection television]]s, where the beam power density can be two orders of magnitude higher than in conventional CRTs, some different phosphors have to be used.

For blue color, ZnS:Ag,Cl is employed. However, it saturates. (La,Gd)OBr:Ce,Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; can be used as an alternative that is more linear at high energy densities.

For green, a [[terbium]]-activated Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;; its color purity and brightness at low excitation densities is worse than the zinc sulfide alternative, but it behaves linear at high excitation energy densities, while zinc sulfide saturates. However, it also saturates, so Y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;:Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; or Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;:Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; can be substituted. LaOBr:Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is bright but water-sensitive, degradation-prone, and the plate-like morphology of its crystals hampers its use; these problems are solved now, so it is gaining use due to its higher linearity.

Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S:Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is used for red emission.&lt;ref name="lumdisp"/&gt;

'''Quarter sawing''' also '''quarter-cut''' is a type of cut in the rip-sawing of logs into [[lumber]]. The resulting lumber is called ''quartersawn'' (quarter-sawn), ''quartered'', and ''radially-sawn''. There is widespread confusion between the terms quartersawn and [[Rift sawing|''riftsawn'']] with both words defined with opposite meanings and as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodworkinghistory.com/glossary_quarter_sawn_oak.htm Raymond McCinis. "Defining Quartered Oak", ''A History of Woodworking: An Online Book'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Quarter-sawn boards have greater stability of form and size with less [[Wood warping|cupping]], shrinkage across the width, shake and splitting, and other good qualities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fplgtr190/chapter_03.pdf Forest Products Laboratory. ''Wood handbook:Wood as an engineering material''. General Technical Report FPL-GTR-190. Madison, WI: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory. 2010. 3–15. print.]&lt;/ref&gt; In some woods, such as oak, the grain produces a decorative effect which shows a prominent ray fleck and [[sapele]] is likely to produce a ribbon figure.

==Process==
When boards are cut from a [[Wooden log|log]] they are usually [[rip cut]] along the length (axis) of the log. This can be done in three ways: plain-sawing (most common, also known as flat-sawn, bastard-sawn, through and through, and tangent-sawn), quarter-sawing (less common), or [[rift sawing]] (rare).

In flat-sawing the log is passed through the blade cutting off plank after plank without changing the orientation of the blade or log. The resulting planks have different annual ring orientations when viewed from the end. The relative angle that form the rings and the surface go from almost zero degrees in the external planks to almost ninety degrees at the core of the log.

Quarter sawing gets its name from the fact that the log is first quartered lengthwise, resulting in wedges with a right angle ending at approximately the center of the original log. Each quarter is then cut separately by tipping it up on its point and sawing boards successively along the axis. That results in boards with the annual rings mostly perpendicular to the faces. Quarter sawing yields boards with straight striped grain lines, greater stability than flatsawn wood, and a distinctive ray and fleck figure. It also yields narrower boards, because the log is first quartered, which is more wasteful.

Quartersawn boards can also be produced by cutting a board from one flat face of the quarter, flipping the wedge onto the other flat face to cut the next board, and so on.

The William Ritter Lumber Company (1890–1960), famous for its Appalachian oak flooring and other products, used a modified technique to reduce waste:  (1) bark and a few boards were removed from two opposite sides of the log; (2) the log was cut in half ''(possibly, four quarters)''; (3) each piece was placed on the flat side and "quartersawn" lumber was cut.&lt;ref&gt;Reedy, Dennie E.  ''The W. M. Ritter Lumber Company Family History Book.'' (no ISBN) p. 57.  (Diagram by F. M. Adkins.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''(Note: no reference is made in this source to the notion of "flipping the wedge" as described in the preceding paragraph. Apparently, the cuts were made without "flipping.")''

Quarter sawing is sometimes confused with the much less common "[[rift sawing]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beatingupwind.com/resources/2010/04/flat-quarter-rift.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;  In quartersawn wood, only the center board of the quarter-log is cut with the growth rings truly perpendicular to the surface of the board.  The smaller boards cut from either side have grain increasingly skewed.  Riftsawn wood has every board cut along a radius of the original log, so each board has a perpendicular grain, with the growth rings oriented at right angles to the surface of the board.  However, since this produces a great deal of waste (in the form of wedge-shaped scraps from between the boards) rift-sawing is very seldom used. Quartersawn wood is thus seen as an acceptable compromise between economical but less-stable flatsawn wood (which, especially in oak, will often display the distinct "cathedral window" grain) and the expensively-wasteful [[rift sawing|rift sawn]] wood, which has the straightest grain and thus the greatest stability.

==Characteristics==
Quartersawn boards have two advantages: they are more resistant against warping with changes in moisture and, while shrinkage can occur, it is less troublesome.

In high-end string instruments, the neck and fretboards can be made from quartersawn wood since they must remain stable throughout the life of the instrument, to keep the tone as invariable as possible.  In [[acoustic guitar]]s, quartersawn wood is also often used for the sides which must be steam bent to produce compound curves. This is partly for structural reasons, but also for the aesthetics of highly figured timbers being highlighted when sawn this way. On high-end electric guitars and bass guitars quartersawn wood is often used as the base material for the neck of the guitar, since this makes for a stronger and straighter neck which aids tuning and setup stability.

The second advantage of quartersawn wood is the decorative pattern on the board, although this depends on the timber species.  Flat sawn wood (especially oak) will often display a prominent wavy grain (sometimes called a cathedral-window pattern) caused by the saw cutting at a tangent to a growth ring; since in quartersawn wood the saw cuts across the growth rings, the visible grain is much straighter; it is this evenness of the grain that gives quartersawn wood its greater stability.

In addition to the grain, quartersawn wood (particularly oak) will also often display a pattern of [[Medullary ray (botany)|medullary rays]], seen as subtle wavy ribbon-like patterns across the straight grain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loyalistforest.com/?page=quartersawn_whiteoak Quality green building materials from Loyalist Forest]&lt;/ref&gt; Medullary rays grow in a radial fashion in the living tree, so while flat-sawing would cut across the rays, quarter-sawing puts them on the face of the board. This ray pattern has made quartersawn wood especially desirable for furniture and decorative panelling.

Quartersawn oak was a key feature of the decorative style of the American [[Arts and Crafts movement]], particularly the work of [[Gustav Stickley]], who said "The quartersawing method of cutting... renders quartersawn oak structurally stronger, also finer in grain, and, as shown before, less liable to warp and check than when sawn in any other way."  Cheaper  copies of Stickley's furniture were sometimes made with the less-expensive [[ash tree|ash]] stained to resemble oak, but it can be identified by its lack of rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[image:Cedrus wood.jpg|thumb|250px|quarter sawn surface, showing ray fleck (modest in this case)]]

Wood cut in this way is prized for certain applications, but it will tend to be more expensive as well. In cutting a log, quarter sawn boards can be produced in several ways, but if a log is cut for maximum yield  it will produce only a few quarter sawn boards among the total; if a log is cut to produce only quarter sawn boards there will be considerable waste.

The process indicated in the US as "quarter sawing" yields a few boards that are quartersawn, but mostly [[Rift sawing|rift sawn]] boards.

'''SDE Sea Wave Power Plant''' is a type of [[renewable energy]] power plant utilizing sea [[wave energy]] for the production of [[electricity]].

==Description==
The device is made of horizontal [[buoys]], one end of which is attached to a [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], or on some other sea-based structure, which create a vertical motion, according to the frequency of the [[sea wave]]. The buoys' movement presses on a [[hydraulic liquid]], which is regulated by systems that convert the energy into circular systems. These systems operate an [[electricity generator]] and the process culminates in electricity production. The system's innovation is based on its self-correcting mechanism whereby, should a large wave overwhelm the buoy, it would flip over and then "wait" for a lower [[tide]] to flip back. The system's high survivability capability is based on the fact that only 10% of its components are submerged in [[sea water]].&lt;ref&gt;Sam Ser, "Making Waves," Jerusalem Post, retrieved April 18th, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developer==
The device is developed by [[Israel]]i company S.D.E. Energy LTD.  S.D.E. has built and tested twelve different models of its system, culminating with a full-scale model that operated and tested in [[Jaffa]] Port near Tel Aviv in [[Israel]] and produced 40&amp;nbsp;kW for a period of a year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sde-has-finalized-the-construction-of-the-first-sea-wave-power-plant-in-jaffa-port-israel-99299954.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 2010, S.D.E. is looking at building a 250&amp;nbsp;kW model also in the port of Jaffa near Tel Aviv, and planning to construct a 100&amp;nbsp;MW power plant as one of its projects in the islands of [[Kosrae]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Zanzibar]].

'''Shekel''' ([[Akkadian (language)|Akkadian]]: ''šiqlu'' or ''siqlu''; {{lang-he-n|שקל}}, {{abbr|pl|plural}}. '''shekels''' or '''sheqalim''') is any of several ancient units of weight or of currency. Since it was a coin that represented a claim on a weight of [[barley]] held in the city warehouse, the term "shekel" was likely used in both contexts: 1) As the name of the coin, and; 2) To describe the measure of barley. This coin weighed about 180 [[Grain (unit)|grains]] (11 [[gram]]s or .35 [[troy ounce]]s).

{{anchor|Etymology}}

==Name==
The [[Hebrew]] word ''shekel'' is based on the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] verbal root for "weighing" ({{sc|šql}}), cognate to the [[Akkadian (language)|Akkadian]] ''šiqlu'' or ''siqlu'', a unit of weight equivalent to the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''gin2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Mathematics and measurement| first = Oswald Ashton Wentworth | last = Dilke|year= 1987 |publisher= University of California Press |page= 46|url= https://books.google.com./books?id=AKJZvXOS7n4C&amp;pg=PA46 |accessdate= 6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the word was first attested in c. 2150 BC during the [[Akkadian Empire]] under the reign of [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], and later in c. 1700 BC in the [[Code of Hammurabi]]. The {{sc|šql}} root is found in the Hebrew words for "to weigh" (''shaqal''), "weight" (''mishqal'') and "consideration" (''shiqqul''), and is related to the {{sc|tql}} root in [[Aramaic]] and the {{sc|θql}} root in [[Arabic]], such as the words ''thiqal'' (the weight) or ''Mithqal'' (unit of weight). The famous [[The writing on the wall|writing on the wall]] in the Biblical [[Book of Daniel]] includes a cryptic use of the word in Aramaic: "Mene, mene, teqel, u-farsin". The word "shekel" came into the English language via the [[Hebrew Bible]], where it is first used in the [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 23:15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest shekels were a unit of weight, used as other units such as grams and troy ounces for trading before the advent of coins. The shekel was common among western [[Semitic peoples]]. [[Moab]]ites, [[Edom]]ites, and [[Phoenicia]]ns used the shekel, although proper coinage developed very late. [[Carthaginian coinage]] was based on the shekel and may have preceded its home town of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in issuing proper coins.&lt;ref name="brony" /&gt; 

Coins were used and may have been invented by the early [[Ancient Anatolians|Anatolian]] traders who stamped their marks to avoid weighing each time used. [[Herodotus]] states that the first coinage was issued by [[Croesus]], King of [[Lydia]], spreading to the golden [[Daric]] (worth 20 [[Achaemenid coinage|''sigloi'']] or shekel),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|contribution=Siglos|contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/543654/siglos}}.&lt;/ref&gt; issued by the [[Persian Empire]] and the silver Athenian [[obolus|obol]] and [[drachma]]. Early coins were money stamped with an official seal to certify their weight. Silver ingots, some with markings were issued. Later authorities decided who designed coins.{{Sfn | DIA | 1964}}  

As with many ancient units, the shekel had a variety of values depending on era, government and region; weights between 7&lt;ref name="dubya" /&gt; and 17&amp;nbsp;grams and values of 11,&lt;ref&gt;Tenney, Merril ed., ''The Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible'', vol. 5, "Weights and Measures," Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; 14, and 17&amp;nbsp;grams are common. When used to pay laborers, recorded wages in the ancient world range widely. The Code of Hammurabi (circa 1800 BC) sets the value of unskilled labor at approximately ten shekels per year of work.&lt;ref name="BotterweckRinggren2004"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dMidce6H4WYC&amp;pg=PA132 |title= Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament |date=21 June 2004 |publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |isbn=978-0-8028-2345-8 |page=132 |author1= G. Johannes Botterweck |author2= Helmer Ringgren |author3= Heinz-Josef Fabry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, records within the Persian Empire (539-333 BC) give ranges from a minimum of two shekels per month for unskilled labor, to as high as seven to ten shekels per month in some records.&lt;ref name="Altmann20162"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UrwJ76OkyY0C&amp;pg=PA62 |title= Economics in Persian-Period Biblical Texts: Their Interactions with Economic Developments in the Persian Period and Earlier Biblical Traditions |date=26 October 2016 |publisher= Mohr Siebeck |isbn=978-3-16-154813-0 |page=62 |author= Peter Altmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survival wage for an urban household during the Persian period would require at least 22 shekels of income per year.&lt;ref name="Altmann20162" /&gt;

===Israelites===
{{Bibleref2|Exodus 30:24}} notes that the measures of the [[ingredients]] for the [[holy anointing oil]] were to be calculated using the '''Shekel of the Sanctuary''' (see also {{Bibleref2|Exodus 38:24–26}}, and similarly at {{Bibleref2|Numbers 3:47}} for payment for the redemption of 273 first-born males &lt;ref&gt;See [[Bemidbar (parsha)#Sixth reading — Numbers 3:40–51]]&lt;/ref&gt; and at {{Bibleref2|Numbers 7:12–88}} for the offerings of the [[leaders of the tribes of Israel]]), suggesting that there were other common measures of shekel in use, or at least that the Temple authorities defined a standard for the shekel to be used for [[Temple of Solomon|Temple]] purposes.

According to Jewish law, whenever a census of the Jewish people was to be conducted, every person that was counted was required to pay the ''half-Shekel'' for his atonement ({{Bibleref2|Exodus 30:11–16}}).&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (vii. 13, § 1)[http://sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/ant-7.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aramaic ''tekel'', similar to the Hebrew ''shekel'', used in [[the writing on the wall]] during the [[Belshazzar|feast of Belshazzar]] according to the [[Book of Daniel]] and defined as weighed, shares a common root with the word shekel and may even additionally attest to its original usage as a weight.

===Second Temple period half-Shekel Temple tax===&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Moed]] and [[Adar]] and [[Hurvat Itri]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;
[[File:JUDAEA_Half_Sheke.jpg|thumb|left|The half-Shekel coin discovered in [[Hurvat Itri|Horvat 'Ethry]]]]
During the [[Second Temple]] period, it was customary among Jews to annually offer the ''half-Shekel'' into the Temple treasury, for the upkeep and maintenance of the Temple precincts, as also used in purchasing public animal-offerings. This practice not only applied to Jews living in the [[Land of Israel]], but also to Jews living outside the Land of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (xviii. 9, § 1)&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological excavations conducted at [[Hurvat Itri|Horvat 'Ethry]] in Israel from 1999 to 2001 by [[Boaz Zissu]] and [[Amir Ganor]] of the [[Israeli Antiquities Authority]] (IAA) have yielded important finds, the most-prized of which being a ''half-Shekel'' coin minted in the 2nd century CE, upon which are embossed the words "Half-Shekel" in [[paleo-Hebrew]] ({{Lang-he-n|'''חצי השקל'''}}), and which same coin possesses a silver content of 6.87 grams.&lt;ref&gt;Boaz Zissu &amp; Amir Ganor, ''Horvat Ethri — A Jewish Village from the Second Temple Period and the Bar Kokhba Revolt in the Judean Foothills'', Journal of Jewish Studies 60 (1), Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies, London 2009, pp. 96; 118.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jewish historian [[Josephus]], the annual monetary tribute of the half-Shekel to the Temple at [[Jerusalem]] was equivalent to two [[Didrachm|Athenian drachmæ]], each Athenian or [[Attic]] drachma weighing a little over 4.3 grams.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[Wars of the Jews]]'' (vii. 6, § 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main |Jerusalem shekel|Bar Kochba shekel}}
The '''[[Jerusalem]] [[Jerusalem shekel|shekel]]''' was issued from {{sc |ad}}&amp;nbsp;66 to 70 amid the [[First Jewish-Roman War|First Jewish Revolt]] as a means of emphasizing the independence of [[Judaea]] from [[Roman Empire|Roman rule]].

===Carthage===
{{main|Carthaginian shekel}}
The '''[[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]]''' or '''[[Punics|Punic]] [[Carthaginian shekel|shekel]]''' was typically around 7.2&amp;nbsp;[[gram]]s in [[silver]] and 7.5&amp;nbsp;[[gram]]s in [[gold]] (suggesting an exchange rate of 12:1).&lt;ref name=dubya&gt;{{citation |last=Crawford |first= Michael Hewson |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=84_G_8q6WQcC |title= Coinage and Money under the Roman Republic: Italy and the Mediterranean Economy |series=''The Library of Numismatics'' |editor= Philip Grierson |display-editors=0 |publisher= University of California Press |location= Berkeley |date=1985 |isbn=0-520-05506-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were apparently first developed on [[Carthaginian Sicily|Sicily]] during the mid-4th century {{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref name=brony&gt;{{ citation |last= Bronson |first= Bennet |title= Bulletin |volume=Vol. 47, No. 10 |date= November 1976 |publisher= Field Museum of Natural History |location= Chicago |url= https://archive.org/stream/fieldmuseumofnat47chica#page/n193/mode/2up |contribution= Cash, Cannon, and Cowrie Shells: The Nonmodern Moneys of the World |pp=3–15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; They were particularly associated with the payment of Carthage's mercenary armies and were repeatedly debased over the course of each of the [[Punic Wars]], although the [[Carthaginian Empire]]'s expansion into [[Carthaginian Spain|Spain]] under the [[Barcid dynasty|Barcids]] before the [[Second Punic War|Second]] and recovery under [[Hannibal]] before the [[Third Punic War|Third]] permitted improving the amount and quality of the currency. Throughout, it was more common for Carthage's holdings in [[North Africa]] to employ [[bronze]] or no coinage except when paying mercenary armies and for most of the [[coin|specie]] to circulate in [[Carthaginian Spain|Spain]], [[Carthaginian Sardinia|Sardinia]], and [[Carthaginian Sicily|Sicily]].&lt;ref name=dubya/&gt;

The '''[[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] [[Tyrian shekel|shekel]]''' began to be issued {{circa|lk=no|300}}&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref name=brony/&gt; Owing to the relative purity of their silver, they were the preferred medium of payment for the [[Temple of Solomon|Temple]] tax in [[Jerusalem]] despite their royal and pagan imagery.

===Israel===
{{main|Old Shekel|New Shekel}}
The '''[[Israel]]i [[old Israeli shekel|shekel]]''' (properly '''sheqel''') replaced the [[Israeli lira|Israeli lira or pound]] in 1980. Its [[currency sign]] was {{angle brackets|[[Image:Old Sheqel sign.svg|14px]]}}, although it was more commonly denominated as '''S''' or '''IS'''. It was subdivided into 100 [[new agora|new agoras or agorot]]. It suffered from [[hyperinflation]] and was quickly replaced.

The '''[[Israeli new shekel|new shekel]]''' replaced it in 1985. Its [[currency sign]] is {{nowrap|{{angle brackets|&amp;thinsp;&lt;big&gt;[[₪]]&lt;/big&gt;&amp;thinsp;}},}} although it is often denominated as '''S''' or '''NS'''. It is subdivided into 100 [[Israeli agora|agoras or agorot]]. Both Israeli shekels are purely units of currency and not weight. With the 2014 series of notes, the [[Bank of Israel]] abandoned the [[romanization of Hebrew|transcription]]s ''Sheqel'' and ''Sheqalim'' in favor of the standard English forms ''Shekel'' and ''Shekels''.

The {{nihongo|'''''shuuto'''''|シュート}} or '''shootball''' is a [[baseball]] [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]]. It is commonly thrown by right-handed Japanese pitchers such as [[Hiroki Kuroda]], [[Noboru Akiyama]], [[Kenjiro Kawasaki]], [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/22/sports/baseball/22gyro.html|title=The Japanese Gyroball Mystery|last=Jenkins|first=Lee|date=2007-02-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Yu Darvish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yu Darvish's Filthy "Shuuto" from Tuesday - What is this pitch?|url=http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2012/4/27/2978114/yu-darvishs-filthy-shuuto-from-tuesday-what-is-it|author=Garik |date=27 April 2012|work=SB Nation-PITCHFX}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Masumi Kuwata]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cJyRXD-mCT0C&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206&amp;dq=Masumi+Kuwata+Shuuto&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LTIt_tBFDR&amp;sig=mfZ2pHD0_-Vln3nI-ZEAqgSaSpE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF-anu36_ZAhVyUt8KHbFYDKUQ6AEIVzAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Masumi%20Kuwata%20Shuuto&amp;f=false|title=Remembering Japanese Baseball|last=K|first=Fitts, Robert|date=2005|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=9780809389735|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The most renowned ''shuuto'' pitcher in history was [[Masaji Hiramatsu]], whose famous pitch was dubbed the ''[[razor]]'' ''shuuto'' because it seemed to ''"''cut the air" when thrown.

The pitch is mainly designed to break down and in on right-handed [[Batter (baseball)|batters]], to prevent them from making solid contact with the ball. It can be thrown to left-handers to keep them off balance. Good ''shuuto'' pitches often break the bats of right-handed hitters because they get jammed when trying to swing at this pitch. It could be said that the ''shuuto'' has a somewhat similar break and purpose as the [[screwball]]. If the ''shuuto'' was thrown off the outside part of the plate, it would tail back over the outside border of the [[strike zone]]. Conversely, if it was thrown on the inside part of the plate, it would move even further inside.

The shuuto is often described in English as a ''reverse [[slider]]'', but this is not strictly the case. The shuuto generally has more velocity and less break than a slider. The [[two-seam fastball]], the [[sinker (baseball)|sinker]], and the screwball, in differing degrees, move down and in towards a right-handed batter when thrown, or in the opposite manner of a curveball and a slider.

The ''shuuto'' is often confused with the [[gyroball]], perhaps because of an article by [[Will Carroll]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robneyer.com/book_04_gyroball.html Rob Neyer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507132537/http://www.robneyer.com/book_04_gyroball.html |date=2005-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that erroneously equated the two pitches. Although Carroll later corrected himself, the confusion persists.

According to baseball analyst Mike Fast, the shuuto "can describe any pitch that tails to the pitcher's arm side, including the two-seam fastball, the circle change-up, the screwball, and the split-finger fastball".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/blog_article/the-shuuto/|title=The shuuto|author=Mike Fast|date=1 June 2010|work=The Hardball Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
The ''shuuto'' is mentioned in the movie ''[[Mr. Baseball]]''. This is the type of pitch that [[Tom Selleck]]'s character is continually unable to hit, even though he is a left-handed batter. The ''shuuto'' is described as "the great equalizer".

== Etymology ==
In the third edition of The Dickson Baseball Dictionary "shoot" is explained as:
{{Quote
|text=''Shoot''　【noun / obsolete】
A kind of thoroughly changing pitching. It was a term used from the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century and it was called as a curve or a variant thereof because the sphere moved "in a certain direction" ("roughly").}}

== Japan and the United States ==
Many [[Japan|Japanese]] pitchers utilize the pitching style of the '''shot''' due to the varying results of the ball twisting or sinking in flight. This is done in an attempt to outwit the [[Batting_(baseball)|batter]] and cause them to either miss the ball when swinging or increase the chance of a [[foul ball]] or easily fielded ball. A shot is more difficult to hit compared to a straight pitch because the batter must compensate for the eccentric movement of the ball between the time the ball leaves the pitcher’s hand and crosses home plate. [[United States of America|America]]n baseball utilizes terms such as [[slider]], [[screwball]], [[breaking ball]], [[changeup]] or [[knuckleball]] instead of the [[Japan|Japanese]] term.

== Technique ==
[[File: Two-seam fastball 1.JPG|thumb|right|Example of a shooting grip]]
[[File: Shoot ball 1.JPG|thumb|right|Example of a shooting grip]]
The pitch can be thrown with the same grip as Tsushima Fast Ball. Depending on the pitcher, the ball is grasped as shown.

Twisting the wrist/forearm using an inward rotation burdens the elbow and can easily lead to injury. Kudo naturally rotated inward after beginning with his forearm outwardly rotated. He released it with a push of the ball using the middle finger without straining the elbow. By contrast Hiramatsu did not put his fingers on the seams. 

A baseball cliche states, "Good pitchers of the curve slider have poor shots, good pitching pitchers have poor curves". This is thought to be due to the difference in hand shape and the difference in pitching form. Aoyama Noboru stated, "In Japan 's history of baseball, both curves and shoots were top notches is about Takehiko Bessho."

== Type ==

=== Razor ===
Shoots with good sharpness are called ''razor shoot'' or ''high speed shoot''. Hisamfumi Kawamura, Ryutaro Imanishi, Akiyama Climbing, Hiramatsu's shoots are called razor shoots, Hiramatsu's shot demonstrated its power especially to the right batter. Shoots such as Morita Yukihi and Kobayashi Masahide are sometimes referred to as high-speed shoots because ball speeds exceeding 150&amp;nbsp; km/h have emerged.

=== Rotation ===
If the pitcher throws a straight ball, or if the release point shifts, the ball may have a rotation similar to the shoot, which is called shoot rotation or natural shoot. It is a mistake to throw a shot with the intention of throwing a straight ball. This requires a shift in the release point and the rotation become loose, the lateral change is also small, and the control is often lost. When a straight ball intended to be thrown aimed on a diagonal (crossfire) shoot rotates, it heads towards the center of the strike zone, so it may be easy to hit. 

It is recognized that this method is not stable, but some pitchers use this as a weapon. Teruhiro Kuroki says "put power in the middle finger" against the alternative "put power in the index finger" of other pitchers when throwing the slider.

'''''Son of Town Hall''''' was a [[junk raft]] which made a [[Transatlantic Crossing|Transatlantic crossing]] in 1998, built by [[Poppa Neutrino]].

Writer [[Alec Wilkinson]] gave a vivid description of ''Son of Town Hall'' in his book ''The Happiest Man in the World'', saying: "The raft looked like a specter, a ghost ship, as if made from rags and rope and lumber, a vessel from the end of the world, or something medieval, a flagship of nothingness, the Armada of the Kingdom of Oblivion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Surgical stainless steel''' is a grade of [[stainless steel]] used in biomedical applications. The most common "surgical steels" are [[austenite|austenitic]] 316 stainless and [[martensite|martensitic]] 440 and 420 stainless steels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stainless Surgical Instruments |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8Y3PhtO_tY |website=YouTube |publisher=Boston Career Institute (BCI Inc.) - Brookline |accessdate=2018-08-04 |language=en |format=video}} at ~6:00 martensitic and austenitic are described, albeit simply as 400 and 300 series&lt;/ref&gt; There is no formal definition on what constitutes a "surgical stainless steel", so product manufacturers and distributors apply the term to refer to any grade of corrosion resistant steel.

316 stainless steel, also referred to as [[marine grade stainless|marine grade stainless steel]], is a [[chromium]], [[nickel]], [[molybdenum]] [[alloy]] of steel that exhibits relatively good strength and corrosion resistance. Along with the [[titanium]] alloy Ti6Al4V, 316 stainless is a common choice of material for biomedical implants. Although Ti6Al4V provides greater strength per weight and corrosion resistance, 316 stainless components can be more economical to produce.  However, immune system reaction to nickel is a potential complication of 316.&lt;ref name="nickel complication"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=P. |last2=Schuh |first2=A. |last3=Ring |first3=J. |last4=Thomsen |first4=M. |title=Orthopädisch-chirurgische Implantate und Allergien |trans-title=Orthopedic surgical implants and allergies |language=German |journal=Der Orthopäde |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=75–88 |year=2007 |pmid=18210082 |doi=10.1007/s00132-007-1183-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="implant allergies"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=P. |last2=Thomsen |first2=M. |title=Implantatallergien |trans-title=Implant allergies |language=German |journal=Der Hautarzt |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=255–62; quiz 263–4 |year=2010 |pmid=20204719 |doi=10.1007/s00105-009-1907-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Implant (medicine)|Implant]]s and equipment that are put under pressure ([[bone]] fixation [[screw]]s, [[prosthesis|prostheses]], [[body piercing jewelry]]) are made out of austenitic steel, often 316L and 316LVM compliant to ASTM F138,.&lt;ref name="ASTM F138"&gt;[http://www.astm.org/Standards/F138.htm ASTM F138 standard]&lt;/ref&gt;
316 surgical steel is used in the manufacture and handling of food and pharmaceutical products where it is often required in order to minimize metallic contamination. 
ASTM F138&lt;ref name="ASTM F138" /&gt;-compliant steel is also used in the manufacture of [[body piercing jewellery]]&lt;ref name="APP Jewelry Standards"&gt;[https://safepiercing.org/jewelry_standards.php Jewelry Standards - Association of Professional Piercers]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[body modification]] implants.

440 and 420 stainless steels, known also by the name "Cutlery Stainless Steel", are [[Carbon_steel|high carbon steels]] alloyed with chromium. They have very good corrosion resistance compared to other cutlery steels, but their corrosion resistance is inferior to 316 stainless. Biomedical cutting instruments are often made from 440 or 420 stainless due to its high hardness coupled with acceptable corrosion resistance. This type of stainless steel may be slightly magnetic.

The '''Talcher–Kolar HVDC system''', otherwise known as the '''East–South interconnection II''' is a 1450&amp;nbsp;km [[HVDC]] transmission connection between the eastern and southern regions in India connecting four states namely [[Odisha]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Karnataka]].  The system has a transmission voltage of ±500&amp;nbsp;kV and was originally put into service in March 2003,&lt;ref name = "Nayak"&gt;Nayak R.N., Sasmal R.P., Sen S., Pelly B., Riedel P., Experience with blocking devices during monopolar operation of +/- 500kV, 2000MW Talcher–Kolar HVDC system in India,  [[International Council on Large Electric Systems|CIGRÉ]] session, Paris, 2006, paper reference B4-204.&lt;/ref&gt; with a rated power of 2000&amp;nbsp;MW.  In 2007 the scheme was upgraded to 2500&amp;nbsp;MW.

The Talcher–Kolar HVDC system is owned by [[Power Grid Corporation of India]] and the converter stations were built by [[Siemens]].

The scheme is a conventional bipolar system with overhead lines for the high-voltage conductors and ground return for the neutral current.
[[File:Hvdc bipolar schematic.svg|thumb|right| Block diagram of a bipolar system with ground return]]

== Ground electrodes ==

The scheme includes two ground electrodes, of ring construction, located at Rohila, 28.5&amp;nbsp;km northeast of the Talcher converter station and at Chikkadasarahalli, 30&amp;nbsp;km northwest of the Kolar converter station.&lt;ref name = "Nayak"/&gt;

However, the soil conditions at some distance from the electrode at Chikkadasarahalli were later found to have higher than expected soil resistivity.  These geological effects gave rise to problems with DC currents flowing into the neutral connections of [[transformer]]s at nearby AC [[Electrical substation|substations]], which required the addition of DC blocking devices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24871">'''Trajectory optimization''' is the process of designing a [[trajectory]] that [[Mathematical optimization|minimizes]] (or maximizes) some measure of performance while satisfying a set of constraints. Generally speaking, trajectory optimization is a technique for computing an open-loop solution to an [[optimal control]] problem. It is often used for systems where computing the full closed-loop solution is either impossible or impractical.

Although the idea of trajectory optimization has been around for hundreds of years ([[calculus of variations]], [[Brachistochrone curve|brachystochrone problem]]), it only became practical for real-world problems with the advent of the computer. Many of the original applications of trajectory optimization were in the aerospace industry, computing rocket and missile launch trajectories. More recently, trajectory optimization has also been used in a wide variety of industrial process and robotics applications.

==History==
Trajectory optimization first showed up in 1697, with the introduction of the Brachystochrone problem: find the shape of a wire such that a bead sliding along it will move between two points in the minimum time.&lt;ref name = "Willems1997"&gt;''300 Years of Optimal Control: From The Brachystochrone to the Maximum Principle'', Hector J. Sussmann and Jan C. Willems. IEEE Control Systems, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The interesting thing about this problem is that it is optimizing over a curve (the shape of the wire), rather than a single number. The most famous of the solutions was computed using [[calculus of variations]].

In the 1950s, the digital computer started to make trajectory optimization practical for solving real-world problems. The first optimal control approaches grew out of the [[calculus of variations]], based on the research of [[Gilbert Ames Bliss]] and Bryson&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Ho,Applied Optimal Control, Blaisdell Publishing Company, 1969, p 246.&lt;/ref&gt; in America, and [[Pontryagin]]&lt;ref&gt;L.S. Pontyragin, The Mathematical Theory of Optimal Processes, New York, Intersciences, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; in Russia. [[Pontryagin's maximum principle]]&lt;ref name = "Ross"&gt;[[I. Michael Ross|Ross, I. M.]] ''A Primer on Pontryagin's Principle in Optimal Control'', Collegiate Publishers, San Francisco, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is of particular note. These early researchers created the foundation of what we now call indirect methods for trajectory optimization.

Much of the early work in trajectory optimization was focused on computing rocket thrust profiles, both in a vacuum and in the atmosphere. This early research discovered many basic principles that are still used today. 
Another successful application was the climb to altitude trajectories for the early jet aircraft.  Because of the high drag associated with the transonic drag region and the low thrust of early jet aircraft, trajectory optimization was the key to maximizing climb to altitude performance.  Optimal control based trajectories were responsible for some of the world records.  In these situations, the pilot followed a Mach versus altitude schedule based on optimal control solutions.

One of the important early problems in trajectory optimization was that of the [[Singular control|singular arc]], where [[Pontryagin's maximum principle]] fails to yield a complete solution. An example of a problem with singular control is the optimization of the thrust of a missile flying at a constant altitude and which is launched at low speed.  Here the problem is one of a [[bang-bang control]] at maximum possible thrust until the singular arc is reached.  Then the solution to the singular control provides a lower variable thrust until burnout.  At that point bang-bang control provides that the control or thrust go to its minimum value of zero.  This solution is the foundation of the boost-sustain rocket motor profile widely used today to maximize missile performance.

==Applications==

There are a wide variety of applications for trajectory optimization, primarily in robotics: industry, manipulation, walking, path-planning, and aerospace. It can also be used for modeling and estimation.

===Quadrotor helicopters===

Trajectory optimization is often used to compute trajectories for [[Quadcopter|quadrotor helicopters]]. These applications typically used highly specialized algorithms.
&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Mellinger and Vijay Kumar, "Minimum snap trajectory generation and control for quadrotors" International Conference on Robotics and Automation, IEEE 2011
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Markus Hehn and Raffaello D'Andrea, "Real-Time Trajectory Generation for Quadrocopters" IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt;
One interesting application shown by the [http://www.kumarrobotics.org/research/ U.Penn GRASP Lab] is computing a trajectory that allows a quadrotor to fly through a hoop as it is thrown. Another, this time by the [http://flyingmachinearena.org/research/ ETH Zurich Flying Machine Arena],  involves two quadrotors tossing a pole back and forth between them, with it balanced like an inverted pendulum.

===Manufacturing===

Trajectory optimization is used in manufacturing, particularly for controlling chemical processes (such as in 
&lt;ref&gt;
John W. Eaton and James B. Rawlings. "Model-Predictive Control of Chemical Processes" Chemical Engineering Science, Vol 47, No 4. 1992.
&lt;/ref&gt;
) or computing the desired path for robotic manipulators (such as in
&lt;ref&gt;T. Chettibi, H. Lehtihet, M. Haddad, S. Hanchi, "Minimum cost trajectory planning for industrial robots" European Journal of Mechanics, 2004.
&lt;/ref&gt;
).

===Walking robots===

There are a variety of different applications for trajectory optimization within the field of walking robotics. For example, one paper used trajectory optimization of bipedal gaits on a simple model to show that walking is energetically favorable for moving at a low speed and running is energetically favorable for moving at a high speed.
&lt;ref&gt;Manoj Srinivasan and Andy Ruina. "Computer optimization of a minimal biped model discovers walking and running" Nature, 2006.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Like in many other applications, trajectory optimization can be used to compute a nominal trajectory, around which a stabilizing controller is built.
&lt;ref&gt;E.R. Westervelt, J.W. Grizzle, and D.E. Koditschek. "Hybrid Zero Dynamics of PLanar Biped Walkers" IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 2003.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Trajectory optimization can be applied in detailed motion planning complex humanoid robots, such as [[Atlas (robot)|Atlas]].
&lt;ref&gt;Michael Posa, Scott Kuindersma, and Russ Tedrake. "Optimization and stabilization of trajectories for constrained dynamical systems." International Conference on Robotics and Automation, IEEE 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, trajectory optimization can be used for path-planning of robots with complicated dynamics constraints, using reduced complexity models.
&lt;ref&gt;Hongkai Dai, Andres Valenzuela, and Russ Tedrake. "Whole-body motion planning with Centroidal Dynamics and Full Kinematics" International Conference on Humanoid Robots, IEEE 2014.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerospace===
For [[tactical missile]]s, the flight profiles are determined by the thrust and [[load factor (aeronautics)|lift]] histories.  These histories can be controlled by a number of means including such techniques as using an [[angle of attack]] command history or an altitude/downrange schedule that the missile must follow.  Each combination of missile design factors, desired missile performance, and system constraints results in a new set of optimal control parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, C.A, "Energy Management for a Multiple Pulse Missile", AIAA Paper 88-0334, Jan., 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

;Decision variables
: The set of unknowns to be found using optimization.

;Trajectory optimization problem
: A special type of optimization problem where the decision variables are functions, rather than real numbers.

;[[Mathematical optimization|Parameter optimization]]
: Any optimization problem where the decision variables are real numbers.

;[[Nonlinear programming|Nonlinear program]]
: A class of constrained parameter optimization where either the objective function or constraints are nonlinear.

;Indirect method
: An indirect method for solving a trajectory optimization problem proceeds in three steps: 1) Analytically construct the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality, 2) Discretize these conditions, constructing a constrained parameter optimization problem, 3) Solve that optimization problem.&lt;ref name=Betts2010&gt;
John T. Betts  "Practical Methods for Optimal Control and Estimation Using Nonlinear Programming" SIAM Advances in Design and Control, 2010.
&lt;/ref&gt;

;Direct method
: A direct method for solving a trajectory optimization problem consists of two steps: 1) Discretize the trajectory optimization problem directly, converting it into a constrained parameter optimization problem, 2) Solve that optimization problem.&lt;ref name=Betts2010 /&gt;

;Transcription
: The process by which a trajectory optimization problem is converted into a parameter optimization problem. This is sometimes referred to as discretization. Transcription methods generally fall into two categories: shooting methods and collocation methods.

;[[Shooting method]]
: A transcription method that is based on simulation, typically using explicit Runge--Kutta schemes.

;[[Collocation method]] (Simultaneous Method)
: A transcription method that is based on function approximation, typically using implicit Runge--Kutta schemes.

;[[Pseudo-spectral method|Pseudospectral method]] (Global Collocation)
: A transcription method that represents the entire trajectory as a single high-order orthogonal polynomial.

;Mesh (Grid)
: After transcription, the formerly continuous trajectory is now represented by a discrete set of points, known as mesh points or grid points.

;Mesh refinement
: The process by which the discretization mesh is improved by solving a sequence of trajectory optimization problems. Mesh refinement is either performed by sub-dividing a trajectory segment or by increasing the order of the polynomial representing that segment.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher L. Darby, William W. Hager, and Anil V. Rao. "An hp-adaptive pseudospectral method for solving optimal control problems." Optimal Control Applications and Methods, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Multi-phase trajectory optimization problem 
: Trajectory optimization over a system with [[Hybrid system|hybrid dynamics]] can be achieved by posing it as a multi-phase trajectory optimization problem. This is done by composing a sequence of standard trajectory optimization problems that are connected using constraints.&lt;ref name=GPOPSII&gt;{{Cite journal|title = GPOPS-II: A MATLAB Software for Solving Multiple-Phase Optimal Control Problems Using hp-Adaptive Gaussian Quadrature Collocation Methods and Sparse Nonlinear Programming|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2558904|journal = ACM Trans. Math. Softw.|date = 2014-10-01|issn = 0098-3500|pages = 1:1–1:37|volume = 41|issue = 1|doi = 10.1145/2558904|first = Michael A.|last = Patterson|first2 = Anil V.|last2 = Rao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trajectory optimization techniques==

The techniques to any [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization problems]] can be divided into two categories: indirect and direct. An indirect method works by analytically constructing the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality, which are then solved numerically. A direct method attempts a direct numerical solution by constructing a sequence of continually improving approximations to the optimal solution.&lt;ref name=Betts2010 /&gt; Direct and indirect methods can be blended by an application of the [[covector mapping principle]] of [[I. Michael Ross|Ross]] and [[Fariba Fahroo|Fahroo]].&lt;ref name="ReviewPOC"&gt;[[I. Michael Ross|I. M. Ross]] and M. Karpenko, "A Review of Pseudospectral Optimal Control: From Theory to Flight," Annual Reviews in Control, Vol. 36, pp. 182-197, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The optimal control problem is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem, since the decision variables are functions, rather than real numbers. All solution techniques perform transcription, a process by which the trajectory optimization problem (optimizing over functions) is converted into a constrained parameter optimization problem (optimizing over real numbers). Generally, this constrained parameter optimization problem is a non-linear program, although in special cases it can be reduced to a [[Quadratic programming|quadratic program]] or [[Linear programming|linear program]].

===Single shooting===
Single shooting is the simplest type of trajectory optimization technique. The basic idea is similar to how you would aim a cannon: pick a set of parameters for the trajectory, simulate the entire thing, and then check to see if you hit the target. The entire trajectory is represented as a single segment, with a single constraint, known as a defect constraint, requiring that the final state of the simulation match the desired final state of the system. Single shooting is effective for problems that are either simple or have an extremely good initialization. Both the indirect and direct formulation tend to have difficulties otherwise.&lt;ref name=Betts2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Betts1998&gt;Survey of Numerical Methods for Trajectory Optimization; John T. Betts 
Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics 1998; 0731-5090 vol.21 no.2 (193-207)
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Rao2009&gt;Anil V. Rao "A survey of numerical methods for optimal control" Advances in Astronautical Sciences, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple shooting===
Multiple shooting is a simple extension to single shooting that renders it far more effective. Rather than representing the entire trajectory as a single simulation (segment), the algorithm breaks the trajectory into many shorter segments, and a defect constraint is added between each. The result is large sparse non-linear program, which tends to be easier to solve than the small dense programs produced by single shooting.&lt;ref name=Betts1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rao2009 /&gt;

===Direct collocation===
Direct collocation methods work by approximating the state and control trajectories using polynomial [[Spline (mathematics)|splines]]. These methods are sometimes referred to as direct transcription. '''Trapezoidal collocation''' is a commonly used low-order direct collocation method. The dynamics, path objective, and control are all represented using linear splines, and the dynamics are satisfied using [[Trapezoidal rule|trapezoidal quadrature]]. '''Hermite-Simpson Collocation''' is a common medium-order direct collocation method. The state is represented by a [[Cubic Hermite spline|cubic-Hermite spline]], and the dynamics are satisfied using [[Simpson's rule|Simpson quadrature]].&lt;ref name=Betts2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rao2009 /&gt;

===Orthogonal collocation===
Orthogonal collocation is technically a subset of direct collocation, but the implementation details are so different that it can reasonably be considered its own set of methods. Orthogonal collocation differs from direct collocation in that it typically uses high-order splines, and each segment of the trajectory might be represented by a spline of a different order. The name comes from the use of orthogonal polynomials in the state and control splines.&lt;ref name=Rao2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rao2014&gt;Camila C. Francolin, David A. Benson, William W. Hager, Anil V. Rao. "Costate Estimation in Optimal Control Using Integral Gaussian Quadrature Orthogonal Collocation Methods" Optimal Control Applications and Methods, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pseudospectral collocation===
Pseudospectral collocation, also known as global collocation, is a subset of orthogonal collocation in which the entire trajectory is represented by a single high-order orthogonal polynomial. As a side note: some authors use orthogonal collocation and pseudospectral collocation interchangeably. When used to solve a trajectory optimization problem whose solution is smooth, a pseudospectral method will achieve [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Spectral_methods spectral] (exponential) convergence.&lt;ref name=ApprxTheoryApprxPractice&gt;Lloyd N. Trefethen. "Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice", SIAM 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential dynamic programming===
[[Differential dynamic programming]], is a bit different than the other techniques described here. In particular, it does not cleanly separate the transcription and the optimization. Instead, it does a sequence of iterative forward and backward passes along the trajectory. Each forward pass satisfies the system dynamics, and each backward pass satisfies the optimality conditions for control. Eventually, this iteration converges to a trajectory that is both feasible and optimal.&lt;ref name=DDP&gt;David H. Jacobson, 
David Q. Mayne. "Differential Dynamic Programming" Elsevier, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison of techniques==
There are many techniques to choose from when solving a trajectory optimization problem. There is no best method, but some methods might do a better job on specific problems. This section provides a rough understanding of the trade-offs between methods.

===Indirect vs. direct methods===
When solving a trajectory optimization problem with an indirect method, you must explicitly construct the adjoint equations and their gradients. This is often difficult to do, but it gives an excellent accuracy metric for the solution. Direct methods are much easier to set up and solve, but do not have a built-in accuracy metric.&lt;ref name=Betts2010 /&gt; As a result, direct methods are more widely used, especially in non-critical applications. Indirect methods still have a place in specialized applications, particularly aerospace, where accuracy is critical.

One place where indirect methods have particular difficulty is on problems with path inequality constraints. These problems tend to have solutions for which the constraint is partially active. When constructing the adjoint equations for an indirect method, the user must explicitly write down when the constraint is active in the solution, which is difficult to know a priori. One solution is to use a direct method to compute an initial guess, which is then used to construct a multi-phase problem where the constraint is prescribed. The resulting problem can then be solved accurately using an indirect method.&lt;ref name=Betts2010 /&gt;

===Shooting vs. collocation===
Single shooting methods are best used for problems where the control is very simple (or there is an extremely good initial guess). For example, a satellite mission planning problem where the only control is the magnitude and direction of an initial impulse from the engines.&lt;ref name=Betts1998 /&gt;

Multiple shooting tends to be good for problems with relatively simple control, but complicated dynamics. Although path constraints can be used, they make the resulting nonlinear program relatively difficult to solve.

Direct collocation methods are good for problems where the accuracy of the control and the state are similar. These methods tend to be less accurate then others (due to their low-order), but are particularly robust for problems with difficult path constraints.

Orthogonal collocation methods are best for obtaining high-accuracy solutions to problems where the accuracy of the control trajectory is important. Some implementations have trouble with path constraints. These methods are particularly good when the solution is smooth.

===Mesh refinement: h vs. p===

It is common to solve a trajectory optimization problem iteratively, each time using a discretization with more points. A '''h-method''' for mesh refinement works by increasing the number of trajectory segments along the trajectory, while a '''p-method''' increases the order of the transcription method within each segment.

Direct collocation methods tend to exclusively use h-method type refinement, since each method is a fixed order. Shooting methods and orthogonal collocation methods can both use h-method and p-method mesh refinement, and some use a combination, known as hp-adaptive meshing. It is best to use h-method when the solution is non-smooth, while a p-method is best for smooth solutions.&lt;ref name=GPOPSII /&gt;

'''Uniformity tape''' is a microstructured thin-film mechanism for mixing and diffusing the light generated by [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) in edge-lit [[digital display]]s, including monitors, televisions and signage.

== Purpose ==

Compared to other sources of illumination, such as fluorescent and incandescent bulbs, LEDs are energy efficient and increasingly inexpensive. As hard-point light sources, however, LEDs have several significant limitations in edge-lit digital displays.

First, the light generated by LEDs must be spread evenly to all parts of the display by a light guide (typically a plate of [[poly(methyl methacrylate)]]), which transports light by [[total internal reflection]] (TIR). Extraction patterns on the surface of the light-guide meter out the light and generate a uniform brightness distribution.

Even with a light guide, dark zones can be noticeable along the injection edge closest to the LEDs.  The existence of these dark zones requires that the injection edge be shielded by a border or bezel. The necessity of incorporating a bezel limits design options and the space available for displaying information.

Dark zones also influence the spacing between LEDs, which is typically between about 9&amp;nbsp;mm and 11&amp;nbsp;mm; placing LEDS farther apart creates more pronounced dark zones. This, in turn, limits the ability of designers to reduce the number of LEDs in a display despite the cost advantages and increased energy efficiency of such a reduction.   Furthermore, the poor light-mixing of current light guides makes digital displays highly sensitive to variations in LED color and brightness.  Closely packed LEDs can also create thermal management issues.

The first microstructured light-mixing tape was scheduled to be introduced in late 2011. 3M™ Uniformity Tape is designed to be applied directly to the injection edge of a light guide for the purpose of defusing the light generated by LEDs. The microstructure consists of linear aspheric prisms (Figure 1) that are aligned perpendicular to the plane of the guide. The size of the microstructure is small compared to the size of the LEDs, typically on the order of 12-50 μm.  As a result, no registration of the tape with the LEDs is required.

Figure 1.
Schematic of Tape on Light Guide and Tape Microstructure
[[File:Uniformity tape-Wiki-fig1.tif]]

== Benefits ==

Microstructured Uniformity Tape greatly reduces dark zones by inducing lateral light-spreading in the plane of the light guide.

The effect of the 3M Uniformity Tape on the injection of LED light from a nominally lambertian LED is shown in Figure 2a-c. The left image in Figure 2a shows the injection cone angle of the LED into a light guide under normal TIR conditions (+/-42 degrees in a conventional PMMA light guide with an optically flat entrance face). The right image shows a close-up view of the left image. Figures 2b and 2c (and their details on the right) show the effects of two variations of 3M Uniformity Tape, with refractive index equal to 1.54 and 1.62, respectively.

Research conducted by 3M indicates that the tape enables a 50 percent reduction in LED count.  Additional redesign of the light guide's extraction pattern could lead to an LED reduction approaching two-thirds of current levels. The tape also opens opportunities for digital displays with lower cost, higher performance and new design flexibility, including the development of a robust backlight that will retain a uniform brightness despite multiple LED failures.

These benefits can be achieved with little effect on overall system efficiency. Injection losses can be as low as 1-2 percent with a properly designed light guide.

Application of Uniformity Tape also appears to provide ancillary benefits. When applied to the input edge of the light guide, the optically clear adhesive will wet out and conform to the surface roughness of the light guide edge so that the film and light guide were optically coupled (i.e., no air is trapped between them).  As a result of this optical coupling, the PMMA plate does not require the level of polishing required in a conventional light guide; this suggests that Uniformity Tape could lead to a reduction in manufacturing steps and lower costs.

[[File:Yard Sale Northern CA 2005.JPG|thumb|A yard sale is a common place to find cheap used goods.]]

A '''secondhand''' or '''used good''' is a piece of [[personal property]] that is being purchased by or otherwise transferred to a second or later [[end user]]. A ''used'' [[Good (economics and accounting)|good]] can also simply mean it is no longer in the same condition as it was when transferred to the current owner. When the term ''used'' means that an item has expended its purpose (such as a used [[diaper]]), it is typically called [[garbage]], instead. 

Used goods may be transferred informally between friends and family for free as '''hand-me-downs'''.  They may be sold for a fraction of their original price at [[garage sale]]s, in [[bazaar|bazaar-style]] fundraisers, in privately owned consignment shops, or through [[Online auction|online auctions]]. Some things are typically sold in specialized shops, such as a [[Used car dealer|car dealership]] that specializes in the sale of used vehicles or a [[used bookstore]] that sells [[Used book|used books]].  In other cases, such as a [[charity shop]], a wide variety of used goods might be handled by the same establishment.  High-value used luxury goods, such as antique furniture, jewelry, watches, and artwork, might be sold through a generic [[auction house]] such as [[Sotheby's]] or a more specialized niche like [https://www.bobswatches.com Bob's Watches].

Governments require some used goods to be sold through regulated markets, as in the case of items which have safety and legal issues, such as used firearms or cars.  For these items, government licensing bodies require certification and registration of the sale, to prevent the sale of stolen, unregistered, or unsafe goods. For some high-value used goods, such as cars and motorcycles, governments regulate sales of used goods to ensure that the government gets its sales tax revenue from the sale.

==Benefits==
Secondhand goods can benefit the purchaser as the price paid is lower than that of the same items bought new. If the reduction in price more than compensates for the possibly shorter remaining lifetime, lack of warranty, and so on, there is a net benefit.

Selling unwanted goods secondhand instead of discarding them obviously benefits the seller.

[[Recycling]] goods through the secondhand market reduces use of resources in manufacturing new goods, and diminishes waste which must be disposed of, both of which are significant environmental benefits. However, manufacturers who profit from sales of new goods lose corresponding sales. Scientific research shows that buying used goods reduces carbon footprint and [[CO2]] emissions significantly compared to the complete product life cycle, because of less production, raw material sourcing and logistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.citeulike.org/article/9832067|title=Impact of closed-loop network configurations on carbon footprints: A case study in copiers|first=Harold|last=Krikke|date=1 October 2011|publisher=|journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|volume=55|issue=12|pages=1196–1205|accessdate=25 May 2018|doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2011.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the relative carbon footprint of production, raw material sourcing and the [[supply chain]] is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.durabilit.eu/Plone/news/how-to-reduce-your-company2019s-carbon-footprint-2013-by-reuse http://www.durabilit.eu/Plone/news/how-to-reduce-your-company2019s-carbon-footprint-2013-by-reuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083915/http://www.durabilit.eu/Plone/news/how-to-reduce-your-company2019s-carbon-footprint-2013-by-reuse |date=2014-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A scientific methodology has been made to analyze how much CO2 emissions are reduced when buying used goods like secondhand hardware versus new hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.future-science.com/doi/full/10.4155/cmt.11.29 Scientific Greener CO2 calculator for reuse] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130124001944/http://www.future-science.com/doi/full/10.4155/cmt.11.29 |date=2013-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quality secondhand goods can be more durable than equivalent new goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/28/buying-secondhand-an-alternative-to-rampant-consumerism-of-black-friday|title=Buying secondhand: an alternative to rampant consumerism of Black Friday|first1=Sarah|last1=LaBrecque|first2=Hannah|last2=Gould|date=28 November 2014|website=the Guardian|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
Secondhand goods may have faults which are not apparent even if examined; purchasing sight unseen, for example, from an [[Internet auction]] site, has further unknowns. Goods may cause problems beyond their value; for example, furniture may have not easily seen [[Bed bug (insect)|bedbug]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11915026/ns/dateline_nbc-dont_let_the_bed_bugs_bite/t/what-you-need-know-about-bed-bugs/ Msnbc: What you need to know about bed bugs]: "Do not buy used furniture (especially bedding items or upholstered items) ... until inspected carefully for any signs of bedbugs"&lt;/ref&gt; which may cause an infestation which is difficult and expensive to eradicate. Faulty electrical and mechanical goods can be hazardous and dangerous. This is especially a big issue if sold to countries that do not have recycling facilities for these devices, which has led to an issue with [[electronic waste]].

==Types of transfers==
Many items that are considered obsolete and worthless in [[developed countries]], such as decade-old hand tools and clothes, are useful and valuable in impoverished communities in the country or in [[developing countries]]. Underdeveloped countries like Zambia are extremely welcoming to donated secondhand clothing. At a time when the country's economy was in severe decline, the used goods provided jobs by keeping "many others busy with repairs and alterations".&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004"&gt;Karen Tranberg-Hansen. 2004. Helping or hindering? Controversies around the international second-hand clothing trade. Anthropology Today 20(4):3-9.&lt;/ref&gt; It has created a type of spin-off economy at a time when many Zambians were out of work. The used garments and materials that were donated to the country also allowed for the production of "a wide range of fabrics" whose imports had been previously restricted.&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; The trade is essentially executed by women who operate their small business based on local associations and networks. Not only does this provide self-employment, but it also increases household income and enhances the economy.&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; But while many countries would be welcoming of secondhand goods, it is also true that there are countries in need who refuse donated items. Countries like Poland, Philippines and Pakistan have been known to reject secondhand items for "fear of venereal disease and risk to personal hygiene".&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt;  Similar to these countries, India also refuses the [[Global trade of secondhand clothing|import of secondhand clothing]] but will accept the import of wool fibers, including ''mutilated hosiery'' which is a term meaning "woollen garments shredded by machine in the West prior to export".&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; Through the production of ''[[shoddy]]'' (recycled wool), most of which is produced in Northern India today, unused clothing can be recycled into fibres that are spun into yarn for reuse in 'new' used goods.&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; 

United States taxpayers can deduct donations of used goods to charitable organizations. Both [[Goodwill Industries]] and the [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]] websites have lists of items with their estimated range of values. Another way that people transfer used goods is by giving them to friends or relatives. When a person gives an item of some value that they have used to someone else, such as a used car or a winter coat, it is sometimes referred to as a "hand-me-down".

[[File:Ebayscreen.png|thumb|[[Online auction]] sites have become a popular way to sell used goods in recent years.]]

Used items can often be found for sale in [[thrift store]]s and [[pawnshop]]s, [[auction]]s, [[garage sale]]s, and in more recent times [[online auction]]s. Some stores sell both new and used goods (e.g. [[car dealership]]s), while others only sell new goods but may take used items in exchange for credit toward the purchase of newer goods. For example, some musical instrument stores and high-end audio stores only sell new gear, but they will accept good quality used items as trade ins towards the purchase of new items; after the store purchases the used items, they then sell them using online auctions or other services.

When an item is no longer of use to a person they may sell or ''pawn'' it, especially when they are in need of [[money]]. Items can also be sold (or taken away free of cost) as [[scrap]] (e.g. a broken-down old car will be towed away for free for its scrap metal value). Owners may sell the good themselves or to a dealer who then sells it on for a profit. They may also choose to give it away to another person this is often referred to as [[freecycling]]. However, because the process takes some effort on part of the owner they may simply keep possession of it or dump it at a [[landfill]] instead of going to the trouble of selling it. It has been common to buy secondhand or used good on markets or bazaars for long time. When the web became popular, it became common with websites such as [[eBay]] and [[Yahoo!|Yahoo! Classifieds]].

==Purchases==
[[File:Landfill compactor.jpg|thumb|left|As dumped used goods take up space in landfills, some may purchase them for [[environmentalism|environmental motivations]].]]

The strategy of buying used items is employed by some to save [[money]], as they are typically worth less than the equivalent new items. Purchasing used items for [[reuse]] prevents them from becoming [[waste]] and saves costly production of equivalent new goods. Motivations for purchase include conserving [[natural resource]]s and protecting the [[natural environment|environment]], and may form part of a [[simple living]] plan.

==Types==

===Cars===
{{Main article|Used car}}
[[File:Toyota Corolla AE82 Sweden.JPG|thumb|Used cars like this 1980s-era [[Toyota Corolla]] are very inexpensive, but a buyer runs the risk of getting stuck with a [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon]].]]

Used [[Automobile|cars]] are especially notable for depreciating in value much faster than many other items.  Used cars may have been bought or [[lease]]d by their previous user, and may be purchased directly from the previous owner or through a dealer. [[George Akerlof]] published a paper entitled "[[The Market for Lemons]]", examining the effects of [[information asymmetry]] on the used car market. Used cars may require more maintenance or have fewer features than later equivalent models.

=== Books ===
{{Main|Used book}}
Used books are often re-sold through a [[used bookstore]].  They may also be given away, perhaps as part of a program such as the [[Little Free Library|Little Free Library's]] programs.  Used bookstores may also sell secondhand music recordings or videos.

=== Used clothing ===
In developed countries, unwanted used clothing is often donated to charities that sort and sell it. Some of these distribute some of the clothing to people on low incomes for free or a very low price. Others sell all of the collected clothing in bulk to a commercial used clothing redistributor, and then use the raised funds to finance their activities.&lt;ref name="tsun2007"&gt;[http://www.torontosun.com/News/TorontoAndGTA/2007/01/11/3299397-sun.html Old duds, big bucks; Clothes you think you're donating to charity are frequently sold for profit] [[Toronto Sun]], 2007-Jan-11, retrieved 2007-Apr-16.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., almost 5 billion pounds of clothing is donated to charity shops each year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.racked.com/platform/amp/2018/3/13/17082288/used-clothing-mexico-goodwill|title=Here’s What Really Happens to Your Used Clothes - Racked|last=Guo|first=Eileen|date=13 March 2018|website=Racked|publisher=Vox Media|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only about 10% of it can be re-sold by the charity shops.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; About a third of the donated clothing is bought, usually in bulk and at a heavy discount, by commercial dealers and fabric recyclers, who export it to other countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Some of the used clothes are also smuggled into Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Used clothing unsuitable for sale in an affluent market may still find a buyer or end-user in another market, such as a student market or a less affluent region of a developing country. In developing countries, such as [[Zambia]], secondhand clothing is sorted, recycled and sometimes redistributed to other nations. Some of the scraps are kept and used to create unique fashions which enable the locals to construct identity. Not only does the trade represent a great source of employment for women as well as men, it also supports other facets of the economy: the merchants buy timber and other materials for their stands, metal hangers to display clothing, and food and drinks for customers. Carriers also find work as they transport the garments from factories to various locations. The secondhand clothing trade is central to the lives of many citizens dwelling in such countries.&lt;ref name="Karen Tranberg-Hansen 2004" /&gt; A dress agent will often deal with a buyer and seller directly, taking unwanted clothes that still have value, and reselling them in a shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosmood.com/?module=articles&amp;id=1 |title=Second hand by cosmood |publisher=cosmood.com |date=2017-08-02 |accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Importation of used clothing is sometimes opposed by the [[textile industry]] in developing countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are concerned that fewer people will buy the new clothes that they make when it is cheaper to buy imported used clothing. Nearly all the clothes made in Mexico are intended for export, and the Mexican textile industry opposes the importation of used clothes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Other items ===
The Sierra Club, an environmental organization, argues that secondhand purchasing of furniture is the "greenest" way of furnishing a home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sierraclub.typepad.com/greenlife/2008/09/green-your-re-1.html|title=Green Your Rental - Eco Furnishings - The Green Life|date=2008-09-30|publisher=Sierraclub.typepad.com|accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Vintage guitar]]s also became increasingly desired objects among musicians and collectors during the nineties and afterwards.  Some music stores specialize in selling used musical instruments, used copies of printed music, and related paraphernalia.

'''Vostok Station''' ({{lang-ru|[[:ru:Восток (антарктическая станция)|ста́нция Восто́к]]|translit=Stántsiya Vostók}}, {{IPA-ru|ˈstant͡sɨjə vɐˈstok|pron}}, literally "Station East") is a [[Russia]]n [[Research stations in Antarctica|research station]] in inland [[Princess Elizabeth Land]], [[Antarctica]].  Founded by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1957, the station lies at the southern [[Pole of Cold]], with the [[List of weather records#Lowest temperatures ever recorded|lowest reliably measured natural temperature on Earth]] of {{convert|−89.2|C|F K|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="NCDC"&gt;[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html Global Measured Extremes of Temperature and Precipitation.] [[National Climatic Data Center]]. Retrieved on 2007-06-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Research includes [[ice core]] drilling and [[Magnetometer|magnetometry]]. Vostok (Russian for ''"east"'') was named after ''[[Vostok (sloop-of-war)|Vostok]]'', the lead ship of the First Russian Antarctic Expedition captained by [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen|Fabian von Bellingshausen]] (the second ship ''[[Mirny (sloop-of-war)|Mirny]]'' captained by [[Mikhail Lazarev]] became the namesake for [[Mirny Station]]).

==Description==
Vostok Research Station is about 1,300&amp;nbsp;km (≈800&amp;nbsp;mi) from the [[South Pole|Geographic South Pole]], at the center of the East [[Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. 

Vostok is located near the [[Pole of inaccessibility|Southern Pole of Inaccessibility]] and the [[South Magnetic Pole#South Geomagnetic Pole|South Geomagnetic Pole]], making it one of the optimal places to observe changes in the Earth's [[magnetosphere]]. Other studies include [[Actinometer|actinometry]], [[geophysics]], medicine and [[climatology]].

The station is at {{convert|3,488|m}} above [[sea level]] and is one of the most isolated established research stations on the Antarctic continent.&lt;ref name="Winchester 2003 168–169"&gt;{{cite book|last=Winchester|first=Simon|title=Extreme Earth|publisher=Collins|year=2003|pages=168–169|isbn=0-00-716392-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station was supplied from [[Mirny Station]] on the Antarctic coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219011635/http://www.aari.nw.ru/projects/Antarctic/stations/mir/mir_en.html|title=Mirny Observatory|date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station typically contains 25 scientists and engineers in the summer. In winter, their number drops to 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2818025.stm|title=Russia abandons Ice Station Vostok|date=4 March 2003|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only permanent research station located farther south is the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]], operated by the [[United States]] at the geographic [[South Pole]]. The Chinese [[Kunlun Station]] is farther south than Vostok but only occupied during summers.

Some of the challenges faced by those living on the station were described in [[Vladimir Sanin|Vladimir Sanin's]] books such as ''Newbie in the Antarctic'' (1973), ''72 Degrees Below Zero'' (1975), and others.

== History ==
[[Image:GISP2 team photo core37.jpeg|thumb|left|310px|Ice cores drilled at Vostok, with a portion of the station behind]]
Vostok Station was established on 16 December 1957 (during the [[International Geophysical Year]]) by the [[2nd Soviet Antarctic Expedition]] and was operated year-round for more than 37 years.&lt;ref name=igsoc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igsoc.org/annals/47/a47a012.pdf|title=Deep drilling at Vostok station, Antarctica: history and recent events|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station was temporarily closed from February to November 1994.&lt;ref name=igsoc/&gt;

In 1974, when British scientists in Antarctica performed an airborne ice-penetrating [[radar]] survey and detected strange radar readings at the site, the presence of a liquid, freshwater lake below the ice did not instantly spring to mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oswald |first=G. K. A. |authorlink= |author2=Robin, G. de Q.  |year=1973 |title=Lakes beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet |journal=Nature |volume=245 |issue=5423 |pages=251–254 |doi=10.1038/245251a0 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Jeff Ridley, a remote-sensing specialist with the [[Mullard Space Science Laboratory]] at [[University College London]], directed a European satellite called [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS-1]] to turn its high-frequency array toward the center of the Antarctic ice cap. It confirmed the 1974 discovery,&lt;ref name=Morton&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/vostok_pr.html | title = Ice Station Vostok | accessdate = 2011-01-31 | first = Oliver Morton | publisher = Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until 1993 that the discovery was published in the ''Journal of Glaciology''. Space-based radar revealed that the sub-glacial body of fresh water was one of the largest lakes in the world – and one of some 140 [[subglacial lake]]s in Antarctica. Russian and British scientists delineated the lake in 1996 by integrating a variety of data, including airborne ice-penetrating [[radar]] imaging observations and spaceborne radar [[altimetry]]. [[Lake Vostok]] lies some 4,000 meters (13,000&amp;nbsp;ft) below the surface of the central Antarctic ice sheet and covers an area of 14,000&amp;nbsp;km² (5,400&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref name="FüttererKleinschmidt2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dieter Fütterer|author2=Georg Kleinschmidt|title=Antarctica: contributions to global earth sciences : proceedings of the IX International Symposium of Antarctic Earth Sciences Potsdam, 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PcJcEvPFpT4C&amp;pg=PA138|accessdate=30 July 2010|year=2006|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-540-30673-3|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic monuments===
'''Vostok Station Tractor''': Heavy [[tractor]] АТТ 11 which participated in the first [[Traverse (surveying)|traverse]] to the South [[Geomagnetic Pole]], along with a [[commemorative plaque|plaque]] to commemorate the opening of the station in 1957, has been designated a [[Historic Sites and Monuments in Antarctica|Historic Site or Monument]] (HSM 11) following a proposal by Russia to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting]].&lt;ref name=ats&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ats.aq/documents/ATCM35/WW/atcm35_ww003_e.pdf|title= List of Historic Sites and Monuments approved by the ATCM (2012)|accessdate=2013-10-26 |work= |publisher=Antarctic Treaty Secretariat |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Professor Kudryashov's Drilling Complex Building''': The drilling complex building stands close to Vostok Station at an elevation of 3488&amp;nbsp;m. It was constructed in the summer season of 1983–1984. Under the leadership of Professor Boris Kudryashov, ancient [[ice core]] samples were obtained. The building has been designated a [[Historic Sites and Monuments in Antarctica|Historic Site or Monument]] (HSM 88), following a proposal by Russia to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting]].&lt;ref name=atcm&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ats.aq/documents/ATCM36/WW/atcm36_ww004_e.pdf|title= List of Historic Sites and Monuments approved by the ATCM (2013)|accessdate=2014-01-09 |work= |publisher=Antarctic Treaty Secretariat |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==

Vostok Station has an [[ice cap climate]] (''EF''), with subzero temperatures year round, typical as with much of Antarctica. Annual precipitation is only {{convert|22|mm|in}} (all occurring as snow),&lt;ref name=Vostokclimate&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aari.aq/stations/vostok/vostok_en.html |title= Vostok Station |publisher=Antarctic Research and Investigation |accessdate= June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the driest places on Earth. On average, Vostok station receives 26 days of snow per year.&lt;ref name=Vostokclimate /&gt; Average summer temperature is {{convert|-31.9|C|F}} and average winter temperature is {{convert|-68|C|F}}. It is one of the coldest spots on earth, with the lowest recorded temperature being {{convert|-89.2|C|F}}.

Vostok Station is not the coldest known location on Earth. The now inactive [[Plateau Station]], located on the central Antarctic plateau, recorded an average yearly temperature that was consistently lower than that of Vostok Station during the 37-month period that it was active in the late 1960s, with its average for the coldest month being several degrees lower than the same statistic for Vostok. Plateau Station never reached the record low set at Vostok. However, temperatures at Plateau Station were only recorded during the 37 months that it was active. Had a lower temperature than the Vostok record occurred there at a later date, it would never have been recorded.

The highest recorded temperature at Vostok was {{convert|-14.0|C|F}}. It is also one of the sunniest places on Earth, despite having no sunshine at all between May and August; there are more hours of sunshine per year than even the sunniest places in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/where-are-worlds-sunniest-destinations-293783|title=Where are the World's Sunniest Destinations?|date=24 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vostok has the highest sunshine total for any calendar month on Earth, at an average of 708.8 hours of sunshine in December, or 22.9 hours daily. It also has the lowest sunshine for any calendar month, with an absolute maximum of 0 hours of sunshine per month during polar night.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aari.aq/data/data.asp?lang=0&amp;station=6#sun_dur.txt {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507070713/http://www.aari.aq/data/data.asp?lang=0&amp;station=6 |date=7 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vostok is one of the [[Pole of Cold|coldest places on Earth]]. The average temperature of the cold season (from April to October) is about {{convert|-65|C|F}}, while the average temperature of the warm season (from November to March) is about {{convert|-42|C}}.&lt;ref name="Winchester 2003 168–169"/&gt;

The [[Extremes on Earth|lowest reliably measured temperature]] on Earth of {{convert|-89.2|C|F|1}} was in Vostok on 21 July 1983 at 05:45 [[Moscow Time]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Budretsky, A.B. | title=New absolute minimum of air temperature | journal=Bulletin of the Soviet Antarctic Expedition |url=http://www.aari.aq/publication/abs_min/abs_min.html| issue=105|year=1984 | location=[[Leningrad]]|publisher=[[Gidrometeoizdat]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Budretsky, A.B. | title=New absolute minimum of air temperature (English Version) | journal=Bulletin of the Soviet Antarctic Expedition |url=http://www.aari.aq/publication/abs_min/abs_min_en.html| issue=105|year=1984 | location=[[Leningrad]]|publisher=[[Gidrometeoizdat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was 07:45 for Vostok's time zone, and 01:45 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] (See ''[[List of weather records]]'').  This beat the station's former record of {{convert|-88.3|C|F}} on 24 August 1960.&lt;ref name=wmoasu /&gt; Lower temperatures occurred higher up towards the summit of the ice sheet as temperature decreases with height along the surface.

The coldest [[wind chill]] was {{convert|-124|C|F|}} on 24 August 2005 with a real temperature of {{convert|-74|C|F}}.

Though unconfirmed, it has been reported that Vostok reached a temperature of {{convert|-91|C}} on 28 July 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2000|last=Liang |first= Yong Li |url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/YongLiLiang.shtml| title=Coldest Temperature On Earth| work=The Physics Factbook| accessdate=2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The warmest recorded temperature at Vostok is {{convert|-14.0|C}}, which occurred  on 5 January 1974.&lt;ref name="poguda"/&gt;

The coldest month was August 1987 with a mean temperature of {{convert|-75.4|C}} and the warmest month was December 1989 with a mean temperature of {{convert|-28|C}}.&lt;ref name="aari"/&gt;

In addition to the extremely cold temperatures, other factors make Vostok one of the most difficult places on Earth for human habitation:
*An almost complete lack of [[Humidity|moisture]] in the air.
*An average windspeed of {{convert|5|m/s|mph km/h}}, sometimes rising to as high as {{convert|27|m/s|mph km/h}}.
*The lack of [[oxygen]] in the air because of its [[altitude sickness|high elevation]] at {{convert|3488|m|ft|abbr=off}}.
*A higher [[ionization]] of the air.
*A [[polar night]] that lasts approximately 120 days, from late April to mid-August, including 85 continuous days of civil polar night (i.e. too dark to read, during which the Sun is more than 6 degrees below the horizon.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/antarctica/vostok-station?month=5&amp;year=2015|title=Sunrise and sunset times in Vostok Station, May 2015|website=www.timeanddate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Acclimatization]] to such conditions can take from a week to two months and is accompanied by [[headache]]s, eye twitches, ear pains, nose bleeds, perceived suffocation, sudden rises in [[blood pressure]], loss of sleep, reduced [[appetite]], [[vomiting]], joint and muscle pain, arthritis, and weight loss of 3–5&amp;nbsp;kg (7–11&amp;nbsp;lb) (sometimes as high as 12&amp;nbsp;kg (26&amp;nbsp;lb)).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Ice core drilling ==
[[Image:Vostok 420ky 4curves insolation.jpg|thumb|right|310px|420,000 years of ice core data from Vostok, Antarctica, research station. Current period is at left. From bottom to top: [[insolation]] at 65°N due to [[Milankovitch cycles]] (connected to &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O); &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O isotope of [[oxygen]]; levels of [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;); relative temperature; levels of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).]]

In the 1970s [[the Soviet Union]] drilled a set of cores 500–952&amp;nbsp;m deep. These have been used to study the oxygen isotope composition of the ice, which showed that ice of the last glacial period was present below about 400 metres' depth. Then three more holes were drilled: in 1984, Hole 3G reached a final depth of 2202&amp;nbsp;m; in 1990, Hole 4G reached a final depth of 2546&amp;nbsp;m; and in 1993 Hole 5G reached a depth of 2755&amp;nbsp;m; after a brief closure, drilling continued during the winter of 1995. In 1996 it was stopped at depth 3623 m, by the request of the [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research]] that expressed worries about possible contamination of [[Lake Vostok]]. This [[ice core]], drilled collaboratively with the French, produced a record of past environmental conditions stretching back 420,000 years and covering four previous glacial periods. For a long time it was the only core to cover several glacial cycles; but in 2004 it was exceeded by the [[European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica|EPICA]] core which, whilst shallower, covers a longer time span. In 2003 drilling was permitted to continue, but was halted at the estimated distance to the lake of only 130&amp;nbsp;m.

The ancient lake was finally breached on 5 February 2012 when scientists stopped drilling at the depth of 3,770 metres and reached the surface of the sub-glacial lake.

The [[Ice core brittle zone|brittle zone]] is approximately between 250 and 750 m and corresponds to the [[Last Glacial Maximum]],&lt;ref name=Lipenkov&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lipenkov VY, Salamatin AN, Duval P |title=Bubbly-ice densification in ice sheets: 11. Applications |journal=J Glaciol. |year=1997 |volume=43 |issue=145 |pages=397–407 |url=http://www.igsoc.org/journal/43/145/igs_journal_vol43_issue145_pg397-407.pdf |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the end of the [[Holocene climatic optimum]] at or near the 250-metre depth.

Although the Vostok core reached a depth of 3623&amp;nbsp;m the usable climatic information does not extend down this far. The very bottom of the core is ice refrozen from the waters of Lake Vostok and contains no climate information. The usual data sources  give proxy information down to a depth of 3310&amp;nbsp;m or 414,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icecore/antarctica/vostok/vostok_data.html Vostok Ice Core Data] www.ncdc.noaa.gov, 2005-12-22. Retrieved 2007-03-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Below this there is evidence of ice deformation.  It has been suggested that the Vostok record may be extended down to 3345&amp;nbsp;m or 436,000 years, to include more of the interesting MIS11 period, by inverting a section of the record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dominique Raynaud, Jean-Marc Barnola, Roland Souchez, Reginald Lorrain, Jean-Robert Petit, Paul Duval  and Vladimir Y. Lipenkov. | title= Palaeoclimatology:  The record for marine isotopic stage 11 | journal=Nature | volume=436 | year=2005 | pages=39–40| doi=10.1038/43639b | pmid=16001055 | issue=7047 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This then produces a record in agreement with the newer, longer EPICA record, although it provides no new information.
