'''1972-1975 Bangladesh''' '''insurgency''' refers to the period after the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|independence of Bangladesh]] when left-wing [[insurgents]], particularly the [[Gonobahini]] fought against the government of [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news |title=JS sees debate over role of Gono Bahini |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/js-sees-debate-over-role-of-gono-bahini-31691 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rizvi now blasts Inu at press briefing |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/politics/rizvi-now-blasts-inu-press-briefing-1240042 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |agency=UNB |date=15 June 2016 |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government responded by forming the [[Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini]], which began a [[crackdown]] on the general populace.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahamed |first=Emajuddin |year=2004 |chapter=The Military and Democracy in Bangladesh |chapter-url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p33231/pdf/ch0731.pdf |editor1-last=May |editor1-first=R.

==Background==
In 1972, [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal]] was formed when it split from [[Bangladesh Chhatra League]], the student wing of the [[Bangladesh Awami League]], under the leadership of [[Serajul Alam Khan]], [[M. A. Jalil]], [[ASM Abdur Rab]] and [[Shajahan Siraj|Shahjahan Siraj]]. Its armed wing, [[Gonobahini]], led by Colonel [[Abu Taher]] and [[Hasanul Haq Inu]], began an armed campaign against the government of [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] in order to establish [[scientific socialism]] and a [[Marxism|Marxist state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hossain |first1=Kazi Mobarak |date=13 March 2016 |title=Hasanul Haq Inu’s JaSoD splits as he names Shirin general secretary |url=http://bdnews24.com/politics/2016/03/12/hasanul-haq-inus-jasod-splits-as-he-names-shirin-general-secretary|newspaper=Dhaka Tribune |accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political killings==
[[Anthony Mascarenhas]] states that by the end of 1973, the number of politically motivated murders in [[Bangladesh]] after independence was over 2000. The victims included some members of [[parliament]] and many of the murders were resulted of intra-party conflicts within the [[Awami League]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Gonobahini also killed numerous Bangladesh Chhatra League and Awami League members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=JS sees debate over role of Gono Bahini |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/js-sees-debate-over-role-of-gono-bahini-31691 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Maoists]] such as [[Siraj Sikder]] of the [[Purba Banglar Sarbahara Party]] and [[Abdul Haq]] began attacking the government and people whom they considered "[[class enemies]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alim |first1=Syed Fattahul |date=1 February 2012 |title=Has Left Politics any Future?|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/forum/2012/february/left.htm |work=Forum |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |volume=6 |issue=2 |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The government responded by forming the [[Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini]]. Anthony Mascarenhas claimed that within three years, deaths of mostly Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal members reached 30,000, all of which were killed by the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini.
&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mascarenhas |first=Anthony |author-link=Anthony Mascarenhas |date=1986 |title=Bangladesh: A Legacy of Blood |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |location=London |page=37 |isbn=978-0-340-39420-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of insurgency==
After being freed by Abu Taher and the Gonobahini, [[Ziaur Rahman]] realized that the disorder set off by the [[National Revolution and Solidarity Day|soldiers' mutiny]] had to be suppressed firmly if discipline was to be restored in the [[Bangladesh Army|army]]. Ziaur Rahman declared [[martial law]], cracked down on the Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal, Abu Taher was sentenced to death and other party figures had various terms of imprisonment slapped on them.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ahsan |first1=Syed Badrul |title=Bourgeois dreams of socialist revolution |url=http://www.observerbd.com/2015/07/07/98425.php|newspaper=The Daily Observer |date=7 July 2015 |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Human Rights Watch]] states that institutionalized violence committed by the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini during the insurgency, established the culture of impunity and widespread prevalence of abuses by security forces in independent Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Abu Ali Mustapha Brigades''' ({{lang-ar|كتائب ابو علي مصطفى}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|katāʾib abū ʿalī muṣṭafā}})'' is the armed wing of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) in the [[Palestinian territories]] (the [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and [[East Jerusalem]]).

Originally named the Red Eagles Brigades the Brigades were renamed in 2001 after [[Abu Ali Mustafa]], the PFLP's leader who was killed by Israel in August 2001. They have been active with attacks on both military and civilian [[Israel]]i targets during the [[Second Intifada|al-Aqsa Intifada]].

On the 16 July 2007, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas requested of all Palestinian resistance groups to relinquish their weapons to the Palestinian Authority. Although several members of [[Fatah]]'s armed wing [[Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]] complied, the Abu Ali Mustafa brigades rejected this, stating that they will not cease their resistance until the Israelis unoccupy all parts of the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]].

==Attacks carried out by the Brigades==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42811">'''Animal genetic resources for food and agriculture (AnGR)''' are a subset of genetic resources (defined by the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] as "genetic material of actual or potential value"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/convention/text/default.shtml|title=Text of the Convention|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and a specific element of [[agricultural biodiversity]]. The term animal genetic resources refers specifically to the genetic resources of [[Bird|avian]] and [[mammal]]ian species, which are used for food and agriculture purposes. Further terms referring to AnGR are "farm animal genetic resources" or "livestock diversity".

AnGR can be embodied in live populations or in conserved genetic materials such as [[Cryopreservation|cryoconserved]] [[semen]] or [[embryo]]s. The diversity of animal genetic resources includes diversity at [[species]], [[breed]] and within-breed level. Known are currently 8,800 different breeds of birds and mammals within 38 species used for food and agriculture.&lt;ref name="2nd Report"&gt;FAO. 2015.

Rome&lt;/ref&gt; The main animal species used for food and agriculture production are [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[chicken]]s and [[pig]]s. In the livestock world, these species are often referred to as "the big five". Some less-utilized species include the [[dromedary]], [[donkey]], [[bactrian camel]], [[African Buffalo|buffalo]], [[guinea pig]], [[horse]], [[rabbit]], [[yak]], [[goose]], [[duck]], [[ostrich]],[[partridge]], [[pheasant]], [[pigeon]], and [[turkey (bird)|turkey]].

==History of animal genetic resources==
The history of animal genetic resources begins about 12,000 to 14,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larson|first=Greger|last2=Burger|first2=Joachim|date=2013|title=A population genetics view of animal domestication|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168952513000152|journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=29|issue=4|pages=197–205|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2013.01.003|issn=0168-9525|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[domestication]] of major crop and livestock species in the early [[neolithic]] time period changed our human evolution and lifestyles. This ability to control food production led to major demographic, technological, political and military changes. Consecutively, thousands of years of [[Natural selection|natural]] and human selection, [[genetic drift]], [[inbreeding]], and [[crossbreeding]] have contributed to the diversification of animal genetic resources and increased the variety of environments and production systems that livestock keeping takes place. Relatively few species have been domesticated; out of the world's 148 non-carnivorous species weighing more than 45&amp;nbsp;kg, only 15 have been successfully domesticated. The proportion of domesticated birds used for food and agriculture is even lower- 10 out of 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/676726229|title=The second report on the state of the world's plant genetic resources for food and agriculture.|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|others=Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.|year=|isbn=9789251065341|location=Rome|pages=5|oclc=676726229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason these numbers are so low is because it is rare to find species with all of the behavioral and physiological traits necessary for domestication. These traits include lack of aggression towards humans, a strong gregarious instinct, a "follow the leader" dominance hierarchy, a tendency not to panic when disturbed, a diet that can be easily supplied by humans (herbivores), a rapid growth rate, relatively short intervals between births, and large litter size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Jared|date=2002-08-08|title=Evolution, consequences and future of plant and animal domestication|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature01019|journal=Nature|volume=418|issue=6898|pages=700–707|doi=10.1038/nature01019|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides their initial domestication, dispersion and migration of these domesticated species has had an equally important impact on shaping the composition of livestock diversity. The process of migration likely varied between regions, but certainly involved the movement of human populations and cultural exchanges between populations. In order to look back and determine where livestock domestication occurred, [[Osteometry|osteometric]] information from archaeological sites, and ancient livestock [[DNA]] studies are useful tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/676726229|title=The second report on the state of the world's plant genetic resources for food and agriculture.|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|others=Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.|year=|isbn=9789251065341|location=Rome|pages=10–15|oclc=676726229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors such as [[mutation]]s, [[genetic drift]] and [[Natural selection|natural]] and [[Selective breeding|artificial]] selection have also played a role in shaping the diversity of livestock populations. As animal populations migrated away from their original sites of domestication, sub-populations were formed through geographic and [[genetic isolation]]. Interbreeding within these sub-populations between individuals that thrived in the local prevailing environmental conditions (and were thus better able to reproduce) contributed to the formation of distinct groups of animals, known as [[breed]]s. This isolation of sub-populations allowed the simultaneous increase in diversification between these sub-populations and increase in uniformity within them. Human intervention through artificial selection of animals with desirable characteristics further increased the differentiation among and uniformity within breeds. Examples of traits that have been deliberately selected by humans include growth rate, milk or egg production, coat color, meat quality, and age of maturity, among many others. The process of artificial selection has been the main reason for gains in output from commercial breeds, whereas the adaptation of indigenous livestock to diverse and challenging environments (natural selection) has been the main factor for their continued survival and production value. Overall, selection, whether it be natural or artificial, ''generally'' results in reduced genetic variation.&lt;ref name="first report"&gt;FAO. 2007. [http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a1250e/a1250e00.htm The State of the World's Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture], edited by B. Rischkowsky &amp; D. Pilling. Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past 250 years the greatest changes in livestock diversity and creation of formal breeds have occurred mainly due to changes that began in England in the late 18th century. These changes have included development of systematic [[Pedigree analysis|pedigree]] and performance recording and applying specific breeding objectives. This led to the fixation of breed-specific traits and an increase in productivity. Some breeds were interbred as distinct, isolated populations, while many breeds continued to interact with each other as a result of intentional cross-breeding or unintended [[introgression]]. Before the end of the 19th century, several breeds had been absorbed by other populations.&lt;ref&gt;Felius, M., Theunissen, B. &amp; Lenstra, J.A. 2015. On the conservation of cattle – the role of breeds. Journal of Agricultural Science, 153: 152–162.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, railways and steamships increased the long-distance transportation of livestock. After the Second World War, artificial insemination became common in cattle and pig breeding. As a result of these developments, a limited number of [[Transboundary Breed|transboundary]] commercial breeds, such as the [[Holstein cow]] and [[Large White pig]], have become very widespread and nowadays increasingly dominate livestock production globally.&lt;ref name="first report" /&gt; Thus, understanding the origins and the history of distribution of livestock are central to maintaining their current utilization and long-term conservation as resources.

==Benefits and uses of livestock diversity==
The wide number of livestock breeds and the genetic diversity within them mean that animal genetic resources have a substantial value to society. The different breeds provide a wide range of [[animal product]]s and services for the benefit of humankind. The diversity of animal genetic resources allows livestock to be raised successfully in a diverse range of different environments and underpins the supply of a range of different products and services: from [[meat]], [[milk]] and [[egg]]s to [[fuel]], [[manure]] and [[Draft animal|draught power]]. 
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Diversity also allows the flexibility to change breeding goals if needed and emphasize alternative traits in response to changes in markets or other conditions. For example the Holstein Friesian Cow which is widely used for its whole milk production. Changes in cereal feed availability or demand for low-solid content milk may decrease the advantage of breeding Holstein cows.

Different breeds produce specific [[wool]], hairs and [[leather]] for clothing, carpets and furniture and are often the basis for traditional garments.

Local breeds that were developed by a given community often have a huge cultural significance for that community. Livestock are often a source of wealth and are critical for its maintenance. They appear frequently in art and often play key roles in traditional customs, such as religious ceremonies, sporting events and weddings. Cultural ecosystem services also create significant economic opportunities in fields such as tourism (including, in the context of food and agriculture, farm holidays and visits to areas with historical or scenic farming or forest landscapes) and recreational hunting.

Breeds that have been developed primarily through natural selection have effectively evolved with their environments and usually provide [[ecosystem services]], such as landscape management, vegetation control, and promotion of biodiversity, that are critical for maintaining those landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;October 2014.

Greater livestock diversity allows humans to be better prepared to meet future challenges, such as [[climate change]]. Having access to a range of diverse livestock traits may allow for greater ability to cope with harsh climates and emerging diseases. Animals with unique adaptive abilities, such as [[Plant disease resistance|resistance]] or [[Tolerance to infections|tolerance]] to diseases and pests, or ability to thrive on poor feed and cope with dry or hot climates can help humans be more resilient to changes in climate. Within breeds, greater genetic diversity allows for continued selection for improving a given trait, such as disease resistance.

===Values of animal genetic resources ===
"From a formal economic perspective, AnGR can have various different types of value for conservation. These values can be categorized as follows 
* Direct use value – results from benefits obtained from the utilization of animal genetic resources, such as the production of milk or meat. 
* Indirect use value – results from the provision of support or protection to other activities that produce benefits, such as through the provision of regulating and supporting ecosystem services (e.g. cycling of soil nutrients, seed dispersal, fire control). 
* Option value – results from the potential benefits of having a given resource available for the future; for example, having genetic variability available that can be used to respond to market and environmental changes. 
* [[Bequest value]] – results from benefits that might be obtained from the knowledge that others may derive benefits from the animal genetic resource in the future.
* [[Existence value]] – results only from the satisfaction of knowing that a given animal genetic resource exists, even if no other type of value can be derived from it.

Increasing the direct use value will contribute to the economic sustainability of a breed and therefore to the potential for successful conservation activities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drucker|first=Adam G|last2=Gomez|first2=Veronica|last3=Anderson|first3=Simon|date=2001|title=The economic valuation of farm animal genetic resources: a survey of available methods|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0921800900002421|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1016/s0921-8009(00)00242-1|issn=0921-8009|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/878605883|title=In vivo conservation of animal genetic resources.|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations., Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.|year=|isbn=9789251077252|location=Rome|pages=65|oclc=878605883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the greatest threats to livestock diversity is pressure from large-scale commercial production systems to maintain only high-output breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/676726229|title=The second report on the state of the world's plant genetic resources for food and agriculture.|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|others=Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|year=|isbn=9789251065341|location=Rome|pages=110|oclc=676726229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent molecular studies have revealed that the diversity of today's indigenous livestock populations greatly exceeds that found in their commercial counterparts.&lt;ref name="first report" /&gt;

Climate change and its impact on livestock is being studied.

==Current state of the world's animal genetic resources==
[[File:AnGR.png|thumb|182x182px|Number of local and transboundary breeds at global level 2018]][[The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) has taken initiative and published two [[The State of the World's Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|global assessments of livestock biodiversity]]: ''The State of the World's Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture'' (2007) and ''The Second Report on the State of the World's Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture'' (2015).
[[File:FAO logo.svg|right|97x97px]]
Although many diverse species and breeds of animals are currently available for food and agricultural production, there is more work to be done on classifying their risk of extinction: in 2014, 17% of the world's farm animal breeds are at risk of [[extinction]] and 58% are of unknown risk status, meaning that the problem may be underestimated. The world's pool of animal genetic resources is also currently shrinking, with rapid and uncontrolled loss of breeds and conjointly their often uncharacterized genes. Nearly 100 livestock breeds have gone extinct between 2000 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/939710260|title=The second report on the state of the world's animal genetic resources for food and agriculture|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Scherf, B.

Unlike plants, which can be easily conserved in seed banks, a large portion of livestock genetic diversity relies on live populations and their interactions with the environment.

Progress is being made in the characterization and management of animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. Recent advances in [[molecular genetics]] have provided data on the history and current status of animal genetic resources. [[Genetic marker]]s and molecular studies are being used to characterize livestock diversity and to reconstruct the events that have shaped the present diversity patterns, including ancestry, prehistoric and historical migrations, [[Genetic admixture|admixture]], and [[genetic isolation]].&lt;ref name="pg 18 1st report"&gt;FAO. 2007. The State of the World's Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, pg 18. edited by B. Rischkowsky &amp; D. Pilling. Rome&lt;/ref&gt; Exploration of the past is essential to understand trends and to better characterize the current state of animal genetic resources. In 2009, six years after the completion of the human genome project, cattle became one of the first livestock species to have a fully mapped genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/23/AR2009042303453.html|title=Scientists Unravel Genome of the Cow|last=Brown|first=David|date=2009-04-24|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some general conclusions from recent molecular studies show that individual breeds only differ by typically 40% in total genetic molecular composition; species differ by about 80% of their genetic material. Additionally, breeds with well-defined and appreciated traits tend to be inbred and have low genetic diversity, while non-descript local populations tend to have high molecular genetic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Groeneveld|first=L.

==Management of animal genetic resources==

===Characterization of animal genetic resources===
Characterization of animal genetic resources is a prerequisite for its management. Advances in molecular genetics have provided us with tools to better understand livestock origin and diversity. There are many technologies capable of determining genetic profiles, including [[whole genome sequencing]], [[shotgun sequencing]], [[RNA-Seq|RNA sequencing]] and [[DNA microarray|DNA microarray analysis]]. These techniques allow us to map genomes and then analyze their implications through bioinformatics and statistical analysis. Molecular genetic studies, especially genome-wide association studies and whole-genome sequencing allow adaptive traits to be linked to genomic regions, genes, or even mutations. For example, horn size, meat quality, gait, and prenatal growth in cattle all have single genes found to be responsible for these phenotypic traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/939710260|title=The second report on the state of the world's animal genetic resources for food and agriculture|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Scherf, B.

Specific regions of DNA, such as [[Quantitative trait locus|quantitative trait loci (QTL)]], include genes affecting observable traits and thus have statistically detectable associations with those traits. However, DNA [[Genetic polymorphism|polymorphisms]] that are not linked to specific traits are now more commonly used as markers for genetic diversity studies. Different levels of genetic diversity information can be obtained from different kinds of genetic markers. For example, [[Autosome|autosomal]] [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] are used for population diversity estimates, estimation of genetic relationships and population [[genetic admixture]], whereas [[mitochondrial DNA]] [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] are used to detect geographic regions of domestication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Naderi|first=Saeid|last2=Rezaei|first2=Hamid-Reza|last3=Pompanon|first3=François|last4=Blum|first4=Michael G.

Some general conclusions from recent molecular studies show that individual breeds within species show variation at only about 1% of the genome, whereas the variation of genetic material between species is about 80%.

===Sustainable use of animal genetic resources===

There are many forms of livestock-keeping, that all have their own pros and cons in terms of maintaining genetic diversity. Systems range from completely human-controlled to wild. They differ in terms of animal management, animal treatment, environmental impact, and market infrastructure.

[[File:Battery hens -Bastos, Sao Paulo, Brazil-31March2007.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=Chickens in Brazil.|Intensive Chicken Farming]]

:::'''Industrial livestock production'''
:::Industrial livestock production or [[intensive animal farming]] employs large-scale, principally landless systems. The animals are separated from the land where their feed is produced, and their environment is highly controlled by management interventions. Since a vast majority of consumers demand low-cost products, industrial livestock production has become common. However, there are several issues with industrial livestock production systems including disease, [[Antibiotic use in livestock|antibiotic use]] and [[Animal ethics|ethical animal treatment]]. Living in densely packed cages or small spaces makes animals more prone to disease transmission from one animal to another.

:::'''Small-scale livestock production'''
:::Small-scale livestock production entails less intensive production cycles, access to outdoors or pasture, typically judicious use of antibiotics, and a connection to local niche markets. This type of livestock production can be maintained in peri-urban and rural settings. There are advantages and disadvantages to each. While it is more difficult and costly to find land for livestock in peri-urban settings, incorporating livestock to small-scale farms can greatly increase the local food supply, reduce garden waste, and provide manure. Peri-urban environments can also provide excellent foraging for [[bee]]s, with less exposure to the [[pest (organism)|pest]]s, [[disease]]s, and even [[pesticide]]s that can be devastating to a colony.&lt;ref name="smallscale f"&gt;Margo Hale, Linda Coff ey, Terrell Spencer, and Andy Pressman, NCAT Agriculture Specialists Published Sept. 2011 © NCAT ''[http://arcd.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/smallscalelivestock.pdf Small-Scale Livestock Production]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, rural small-scale livestock production is traditionally more common, and allows for larger-scale operations (although much smaller than industrial systems). However, access to formal markets, both to acquire inputs and to sell outputs, is critical for economic sustainability. Close rural-urban linkages are important to overcome constraints of feed scarcity and to better utilize the advantages of each system.
:::'''Mixed farming'''
:::[[Mixed farming]] systems involves livestock keeping integrated with other agricultural activities. These systems are similar to small-scale systems, but tend to be in a more rural setting, given the need for larger tracts of land for crop production. As with small-scale livestock production, access to formal markets is critical.

:::'''[[Ranching]] or grass-based production'''
:::These systems revolve around access to privately owned or rented grasslands, which the [[ruminant]] livestock feed on. In general, the livestock keeper has a fixed home and animals move around the property as needed to obtain freshly grown grass.

[[File:Fulani herd in the dust.jpg|alt=Pastoralism.|thumb|Pastoralism]]

:::'''Pastoralism'''
:::[[Pastoralism]] plays an important role in livestock management and food security, since pastoralists can produce food where no crops can grow. This system usually relies entirely on publicly-owned grasslands. Pastoralists move their livestock herds based on the season, which is also known as [[transhumance]]. [[Nomadic pastoralism|Nomadic pastoralists]] follow an irregular pattern of movement. Current issues that pastoralists face include conflict over land rights, access to water, limited food resources, integration into global markets, and animal diseases. Climate change has been believed to harm pastoralists, but evidence suggests that the root causes of land disputes are historical and political, rather than climate-related.&lt;ref&gt;Tor A. Benjaminsen. Sept. 2016. International Institute for Environment and Development. "Does climate change cause conflicts in the Sahel?" http://www.iied.org/does-climate-change-cause-conflicts-sahel&lt;/ref&gt;  Land rights are an issue for pastoralists, as many governments and organizations, including conservation efforts may restrict their access to valuable resources and land.

===Conservation of animal genetic resources===
For some breeds, opportunities for sustainable use are limited. For such breeds, to ensure that their critical genetic diversity is not lost, conservation programs are required. Several approaches for conservation can be applied, including [[in situ conservation]] with live animal populations, and [[ex situ conservation]] or [[Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources|cryoconservation]] involving the freezing of genetic materials. In many instances, both of these approached are used in a complementary manner. In order to establish and strengthen these programs, more research on methods and technologies must be undertaken, especially for less common livestock species, and greater financial investment is required.

Many countries are currently operating conservation programs for their animal genetic resources, at least for some species and breeds. In situ conservation programs are the most commonly used approach.&lt;ref name="2nd Report" /&gt;

==Policy for animal genetic resources==
The management of issues regarding animal genetic resources on the global level is addressed by the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (CGRFA), which is a body of FAO. In May 1997, The CGRFA established an Intergovernmental Technical Working Group on Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITWG-AnGR).&lt;ref&gt;FAO Animal Production and Health website. accessed Nov 2016 http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/genetics/angrvent.html&lt;/ref&gt; The ITWG-AnGR's objectives are to review the situation and issues related to agrobiodiversity of animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. With this knowledge it can make recommendations and advise the Commission on these matters, and consider progress resulting from proposed interventions.&lt;ref&gt;FAO, 2016. [http://www.fao.org/nr/cgrfa/cgrfa-about/cgrfa-sector/cgrfa-sag/en/ Statutes of the Intergovernmental Technical Working Group on Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture] Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; This group worked with many partners and countries to produce the First Report on the State of Animal Genetic Resources, which served as the basis for creating the [[Global plan of action for animal genetic resources|Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources]] (GPA). In 2007, the GPA was adopted by 109 countries as the first agreed international framework for the management of livestock biodiversity.&lt;ref name="GPA"&gt;FAO. 2007. [http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a1404e/a1404e00.htm The Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources and the Interlaken Declaration]. Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of the GPA is overseen, monitored and evaluated by the CGRFA. The funding for this program arrives from a wide range of actors, under the guidelines of the ''Funding Strategy for the Implementation of the Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources''.&lt;ref&gt;FAO, 2010.[http://www.fao.org/docrep/012/i1674e/i1674e00.htm Funding Strategy for the Global Plan of Action] Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

The access and benefit sharing of animal genetic resources are currently regulated by the [[Nagoya Protocol]] on Access and Benefit sharing, which is an agreement to the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity. The Nagoya Protocol entered into force on 12 October 2014 and aims to provide a legal framework for the fair and equitable distribution of benefits arising from the utilization of all genetic resources, including animal genetic resources for food and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Nagoya Protocol from the Convention on Biological Diversity https://www.cbd.int/abs/ accessed Oct. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This protocol may have both positive and negative impacts on the exchange of animal genetic resources between signatory countries.

Within the [[Agenda 2030]] for Sustainable Development, AnGR are addressed under the target 2.5: ''"By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/|title=Hunger and food security - United Nations Sustainable Development|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Which is monitored by the following indicators:

"2.5.1: Number of plant and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture secured in either medium or long term conservation facilities.

2.5.2: Proportion of local breeds, classified as being at risk, not at risk or unknown level of risk of extinction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/goals/goal-2/en/|title=SDG 2. Zero hunger {{!}} Sustainable Development Goals {{!}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|website=www.fao.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although policies can have some negative consequences, they are nonetheless important. Lack of adequate policies can lead to the insufficient capacity to manage AnGRs, further a loss of genetic diversity and marginalization of relevant stakeholders, such as [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]], who are valuable players in maintaining livestock diversity.

To help regulate the ownership of genetic resources and control their utilization is one example where policies are necessary. [[Patenting genes|Patenting of genetic resources]] is one approach that has been applied. Patenting of animal genetic resources reached its apex in the late 1990s, focusing on [[expressed sequence tag]]s (ESTs) and [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) with associations in economically important traits. SNPs are important in marker-assisted breeding for the identification of traits such as meat or milk quality. At the same time, patenting activity involving transgenic livestock also increased. However, work on patents and characterization of AnGR declined sharply from 2001, caused by a combination of factors including an increasingly restrictive approach to the patentability of DNA sequences by patent offices and a lack of markets for food products from transgenic animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_941_2014.pdf|title=World Intellectual Property Indicators|last=|first=|date=2018-06-06|website=www.wipo.int|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trends in activity arising from genome sequencing projects merit careful attention with regard to their implications (positive or negative) for animal genetic resources management.

Increasingly complex issues are emerging that require balancing the interests of many stakeholders. In a time of rapid and unregulated change, livestock and their products should be used sustainably, developed and ultimately conserved. National planning should integrate "consumer affairs, human health matters, and the management of new biotechnologies, as well as physical and spatial planning of animal production in the context of urban expansion and protected areas."&lt;ref name="GPA" /&gt;

There are many online databases for policies, national laws, treaties and regulations on food, agriculture and renewable natural resources, including animal genetic resources. [http://faolex.fao.org/faolex/index.htm FAOLEX] is one of the largest online databases, and is run by FAO.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13675">'''Anti-Soviet Agitation and Propaganda''' (ASA) ({{lang-ru|Антисове́тская агита́ция и пропага́нда (АСА)}}) was a [[criminal offence]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. To begin with the term was interchangeably used with '''counter-revolutionary agitation'''. The latter term was in use immediately after the first [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] in February 1917. The offence was codified in criminal law in the 1920s, and revised in the 1950s in two articles of the RSFSR Criminal Code. The offence was widely used against [[Soviet dissidents]].&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 2nd rev.| publisher = M.

== "Anti-Soviet Agitation" under Stalin ==
The new Criminal Codes of the 1920s introduced the offence of ''Anti-Soviet Agitation and Propaganda'' as one of the many forms of counter-revolutionary activity grouped together under [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|Article 58 of the Russian RSFSR Penal Code]]. The article was put in force on 25 February 1927 and remained in force throughout the period of [[Stalinism]]. Article 58:10, "'''propaganda and agitation that called to overturn or undermining of the Soviet regime'''", was punishable with at least 6 months of imprisonment, up to and including the [[death sentence]] in periods of war or unrest.

As applied in Stalin's time, the phrase in practise could mean virtually anything that a State security interrogator or informant wanted it to mean; consequently, the charge became an exceedingly potent weapon in political or personal quarrels and intrigues.

The offence was significantly revised in the post-Stalin Criminal Code of the RSFSR, introduced in 1958. Article 58.10 was replaced by Article 70, '''Anti-Soviet Agitation and Propaganda.'''&lt;ref group=nb&gt;In the new Criminal Code of the other 14 Union republics this offence had a different numeration, e.g. Article 62 in Ukrainian SSR, and to avoid confusion was usually expressed as Article 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was defined as: &lt;!-- In my spare time I will find the direct quotations from the Russian code.--&gt;&lt;ref name=encyc/&gt; 
#propaganda or agitation with the purpose of undermining or weakening of the [[Soviet power]] or with the purpose of committing or incitement to commit particularly grave crimes against the Soviet state (as defined in the law);

#production, dissemination or storage, for the same purposes, of literature with anti-Soviet content

It was one of the two main legal instruments for the prosecution of [[Soviet dissidents]], the other being Article 190 of the RSFSR Criminal Code. Other means of control were extrajudicial, such as the use of [[punitive psychiatry]] or the generalised offence of the [[parasitism (social offense)|social parasitism]]. In particular, the clause about literature targeted ''[[samizdat]]''.{{refn|group=nb|In 1984 the phrasing was expanded to include "materials in written, printed or other form", which could accommodate art works, video cassettes and any other new form of technology that appeared in the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Law and the Gorbachev Era: Essays in Honor of Dietrich André Loeber|last=Shelley|first=Louise|date=1988|publisher=M.

While the clauses were phrased using the provision "with the purpose of", official commentaries (referred to as "Additions and Explanations to..."), as well as the actual legal practice made it sufficient to assert that the prosecuted person of sane mind must have realized the malicious implications of their utterances.&lt;ref name=encyc/&gt;

Shortly after the [[Sinyavsky-Daniel trial]], the Soviet Penal Code was augmented with Article 190-1, '''Dissemination of knowingly false fabrications that defame the Soviet state and social system''' (1966), which was a weaker version of Article 70. It basically repeated the Article 70, with the omitted provision of the "anti-Soviet purpose". The penalty was lower: up to 3 years of imprisonment.&lt;ref name="encyc" /&gt;

=== Application ===
[[Petro Grigorenko]] in his memoirs wrote that any critique of the Soviet government or events in the Soviet Union was easily classified as ASA. Dissemination of any information which was not officially recognized was classified as "Anti-Soviet slander". In this way nearly all members of [[Helsinki Watch]] were imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Petro Grigorenko ''Memoirs: Pietro G. Grigorenko'' W W Norton &amp; Co Inc; 1st edition (1982) {{ISBN|0-393-01570-X}} &lt;!--I checked this from p. 781, Part III, Section 33 "Нам отдых только снится" of Russian language 1981 print by ''Detinets'' (Детинец) publ. house --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Soviet political behavior, in particular, being outspoken in opposition to the authorities, demonstrating for reform, writing books were defined in some persons as being simultaneously a criminal act (e.g., violation of Articles 70 or 190-1), a symptom (e.g., "delusion of reformism"), and a diagnosis (e.g., "[[sluggish schizophrenia]]").&lt;ref name=Report&gt;{{cite journal|title=Report of the U.S. Delegation to Assess Recent Changes in Soviet Psychiatry|journal=[[Schizophrenia Bulletin]]|year=1989|volume=15|issue=4 Suppl|page=26|pmid=2638045|doi=10.1093/schbul/15.suppl_1.1|url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/suppl_1/1.1.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 70th and 190th Articles of the Criminal Code concerning "slanderous fabrications that discredited the Soviet system" and "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda" served as the formal basis to sentence [[Vladimir Bukovsky]], [[Pyotr Grigorenko]], [[Valeria Novodvorskaya]], [[Zhores Medvedev]], [[Andrei Amalrik]] and many others to months and sometimes years of indefinite confinement in psychiatric institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ryzhkov, Vladimir|title=A backward tradition of manipulating history|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/377498.html|work=[[The Moscow Times]]|date=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 February 1986, [[Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov]] in his letter to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] wrote, "application by courts of Articles 70 and 190-1 is pronounced persecution for beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Сахаров, Андрей|title=Воспоминания.

Горбачеву|trans-chapter=Letter to M.S. Gorbachev}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|559}}

In 1990, just before the very end of the Soviet regime, "Anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda" was excluded from the RSFSR Criminal Code after three decades of its application.

==Post-Soviet Russia==

In April 1989, Article 70 was reformulated as part of a series of statutory changes made under [[perestroika]]. It was more strictly formulated and became explicitly related to violent actions. The terms "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda" were replaced by "public appeals", "subversion" (''podryv'', подрыв) and "overthrow" (''sverzheniye'', свержение).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dutch contributions to the Twelfth International Congress of Slavists: Kraków, August 26 - September 3, 1998 ; literature|last=Artz|first=Martine|date=1999|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-0715-4|series=Studies in Slavic literature and poetics|location=Amsterdam|pages=28|chapter=The Charge Against Andrej Sinjavskij|editors=International Congress of Slavists, Willem G. Weststeijn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1992, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russian law retained an offense of "public appeals to alter the constitutional order by force or to seize power, as well as the largescale distribution of material with such content", punishable by detention for a period of up to three years or a fine of twenty monthly minimum wages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ved.RF 1992 nr. 44, Art. 2470&lt;/ref&gt;

In the new Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, effective from 1 January 1997, the offence of "anti-Soviet propaganda" has no parallel. More recently a retrogressive trend in amendments to existing laws led attorney [[Henri Reznik]] to raise the alarm about the appearance of the phrase "[[Anti-Russian sentiment|anti-Russian]]" in certain legislative proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Елена Масюк|title=Адвокат Генри РЕЗНИК: "В этой норме фактически меняется только одно прилагательное — с «антисоветская" на "антироссийская"|trans-title=Lawyer Henry REZNIK: "In this provision, only one adjective is actually changed - from "anti-Soviet" to "anti-Russian""|url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/politics/69347.html|work=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|issue=79|date=27 July 2015|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, she became the first woman employed as a full [[professor]] on the faculty of the formerly all-male institution, where she remained until her retirement in 2004, at the age of 81.&lt;ref name=oah&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2005aug/formwalt.html|title=Lee W.

==Background==
Unterberger was born in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], to Joseph "Scotty" Miller and the former Leah Milner,&lt;ref name=bmuo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/theeagle/obituary.aspx?n=dr-betty-miller-unterberger&amp;pid=157673293|title=Dr/ Betty Miller Unterberger|publisher=''The Bryan-College Station Eagle''|accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was reared in the United States. In 1943, aided with a scholarship in speech, she obtained her [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Syracuse University]] in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[New York (U.S. state)|New York]]. Her central interests were in history and [[political science]], however. In 1946, she received the [[Master of Arts]] in history&lt;ref name=bmuo/&gt; from the women's [[Radcliffe College]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], now part of [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=oah/&gt;

Unterberger was particularly influenced at Radcliffe/ Harvard by the diplomatic historian [[Thomas A. Bailey]], a visiting scholar from [[Stanford University]]. It was from Bailey that she learned about [[American Expeditionary Force Siberia|American troops sent to Siberia]] in Russia at the end of World War I during the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] between the [[Bolshevik]]s and the [[Menshevik]]s. Her [[Ph.D.]] [[dissertation]] at [[Duke University]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]], became the basis for her first book on the subject, the award-winning ''America's Siberian Expedition, 1918-1920: A Study of National Policy''.&lt;ref name=oah/&gt;

At Duke, Unterberger enrolled in a [[seminar]] with Professor Charles Sydnor. She wrote a paper on [[Thomas Braidwood]] of Scotland and the origin of schools for the hearing impaired.&lt;ref name=oah/&gt; This article, "The First Attempt to Establish an Oral School for the Deaf and Dumb in the United States," was published in 1947 in the ''[[Journal of Southern History]]'' and became the first of her many publications.&lt;ref&gt;Betty Miller Unterberger, "The First Attempt to Establish an Oral School for the Deaf and Dumb in the United States," ''[[Journal of Southern History]],'' Vol. XIII (November, 1947), pp. 556-566&lt;/ref&gt; It is on a much different topic than her later writings, the majority of which focus on foreign policy.

==Academic career==
From 1948-1950, while she was still working on her Ph.D., Unterberger taught at [[East Carolina University]] in [[Greenville, North Carolina]]. From 1954 to 1961, she was an associate professor of history and the director of the Liberal Arts Center for Adults at [[Whittier College]], and from 1961–1965, an associate professor at [[California State University, Fullerton]], where she was also from 1965 to 1968 professor and chair of the graduate studies division.&lt;ref name=bmuvita&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamu.edu/history/faculty/unterberger/cv.pdf|title=Betty Miller Unterberger: Curriculum Vitae|publisher=tamu.edu|accessdate=October 23, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527235253/http://www.tamu.edu/history/faculty/unterberger/cv.pdf|archivedate=May 27, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1968, Unterberger came to [[Texas A&amp;M University]] as a full professor. Her appointment coincidentally developed when her husband, Robert Ruppe Unterberger (April 27, 1921 &amp;ndash; February 14, 2016), accepted a full professorship in [[geophysics]] there. In his career, Robert Unterberger researched unique forms of [[radar]] and [[sonar]] and obtained several international [[patent]]s.&lt;ref name=robertr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theeagle.com/obituaries/unterberger-robert-ruppe/article_988183e4-3d4e-5c88-8a5a-b8974378f8c8.html|title=Robert Unterberger|publisher=''The Bryan-College Station Eagle''|accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oah/&gt; "I felt very much alone [as a woman] at Texas A&amp;M, but it wasn't strange to me," Unterberger said much later (There had been only three women professors in southern California at the time that the Unterbergers came to Texas). "I had been told that I [was] taking the bread out of the mouths of deserving male grad students," Unterberger often recalled.&lt;ref name=battalion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebatt.com/2.8485/a-m-s-first-woman-prof-speaks-out-1.120703 |title=Carrie Pierce, "A&amp;M's first woman prof speaks out, January 27, 2004 |work=Texas A&amp;M Battalion student newspaper |accessdate=October 22, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Offered a full professorship by Horace R. Byers, then the Texas A&amp;M vice president for academic affairs, Unterberger recalled that he asked her to "internationalize the history department and build the graduate program. I love to build programs, and this was a wonderful challenge."&lt;ref&gt;"Twelve Fearless Firsts", ''Spirit: The Texas A&amp;M Foundation Magazine'', Fall 2013, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Unterberger related how she became close to the first [[African American]] student who attended her class in 1969: "He came to see me in tears one day saying that on his [[dormitory]] room was a big sign that said 'N--- Go Home!' I took him under my wing. I tried to have students understand one another. The only thing that makes us different is our backgrounds, experience, and differences in cultures."&lt;ref name=battalion/&gt; By 1976, TAMU had elected its first black student body president, Fred McClure.&lt;ref name=battalion/&gt; She also invited her students on occasion for social gatherings at her home.

From January to August 1979, Unterberger was a [[Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation|Woodrow Wilson Fellow]] at [[Princeton University]]. From the late 1980s on, she was a frequent visiting professor, teaching at the [[University of California, Irvine]] in 1987, at [[Peking University]]'s [[Institute of International Relations (Beijing)|Institute of International Relations]] in 1988, and at Prague's [[Charles University]] in 1992. In 1991, she was appointed Patricia and Bookman Peters Professor of History at Texas A&amp;M, and in 2000 was elevated to Regents professor of the [[Texas A&amp;M University System]].&lt;ref name=bmuvita/&gt;
 
A high point of Unterberger's career was her election in 1986 as president of the [[Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations]], an organization 99 percent male founded in 1967, running against [[Robert Dallek]].&lt;ref name=oah/&gt; Toward the end of her career, she developed an interest in India and Pakistan, particularly the work of [[Pandurang Shastri Athavale]], or "Dada", the founder of the [[Swadhyay Movement]]. According to her, Swadhyay had "liberated millions from poverty and moral dissipation." In 1997, she successfully nominated Athavale for the $1.3 million [[Templeton Prize]] for Progress in Religion.&lt;ref name=oah/&gt;

Unterberger served on the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] Advisory Committee for Access to Documents and Open Information. She received a personal letter of appreciation for her service from [[Leon Panetta]], the then CIA director.&lt;ref name=bmuo/&gt;

==Family==
Robert Unterberger also held a Ph.D. from Duke University. [[Howard Mumford Jones]], Unterberger's Harvard graduate school advisor, had urged her to marry Robert. At first reluctant, she consented after being stricken by [[influenza]]. Robert Unterberger served in both [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. He was severely injured when his jeep blew up in the [[Philippines]] two days after the official end of World War II.&lt;ref name=oah/&gt; The Unterbergers were the parents of Glen Alan Unterberger (1951–1978);&lt;ref&gt;[[Social Security Death Index]]&lt;/ref&gt; the Reverend Dr. Gail L. Unterberger (born 1952), the wife of Randall Adams; and Gregg R. Unterberger (born 1958).&lt;ref name=bmuo/&gt; Howard Jones had much impact on Unterberger, having introduced her to the technical advantages of having a [[dictaphone]] in her historical writing.&lt;ref name=oah/&gt;
 
Both Robert and Betty Unterberger were [[cancer]] survivors. He overcame [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref name=robertr/&gt; She endured four surgeries between 1950 and 1964.&lt;ref name=oah/&gt; The couple resided in College Station, where she died at the age of 89; he at 94, in 2016. There were memorial services for both in 2012 and 2016, respectively, at the All Faith Chapel on the Texas A&amp;M campus. Both were [[Cremation|cremated]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=robertr/&gt;

The '''bombardment of Algiers''' in 1683 was a French naval operation against the [[Ottoman Algeria|Regency of Algiers]] during the Franco-Algerian War of 1681-88. It led to the rescue of more than 100 French prisoners,&lt;ref name="Montrond1860"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clement Melchior Justin Maxime Fourcheux de Montrond|title=Les marins les plus celebres. Par ---. 5. ed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bSxniTA01v0C&amp;pg=PA55|year=1860|publisher=Lefort|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some cases after decades of captivity, but the great majority of Christian slaves in Algiers were not liberated.

== Background ==
The previous year, [[Louis XIV]] had ordered [[Abraham Duquesne|Duquesne]] to [[Bombardment of Algiers (1682)|bombard Algiers]] after the Dey declared war on France. At the head of a forty-strong fleet, Duquesne sailed to Algiers in July 1682, but bad weather delayed his attack.  After several bombardments in August, the city suffered serious damage, but bad weather prevented the signing of a conclusive peace agreement, forcing Duquesne to return to France.

In the Spring of 1683, Duquesne set to sea once again with a fleet of 17 [[ships of the line]], 3 [[frigates]], 16 [[galleys]], 7 [[galiot|bomb galiots]], 48 longboats, 18 [[fluyt]]s and 8 [[tartane]]s. This was a larger force than had been sent to Algiers the previous year.  As well as being more numerous, the galiots were better equipped and manned by a special corps of bombardiers.&lt;ref name="Michelant"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vallee-du-ciron.com/Documents/Ouvrages/Michelant/1683.Alger.htm|title=Bombardement d'Alger par Duquesne|last=Michelant |first=L. |date= |website=Faits mémorables de l'histoire de France |publisher= |access-date=21 April 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fleet set sail from [[Toulon]] on 23 May.

== Second bombardment of Algiers ==
The bombardment began on the night of 26-27 June, and two hundred and twenty two bombs, launched in less than twenty four hours, started fires in Algiers and prompted general disorder as well as killing around 300 Algerians.  Hassan Dey intended to resist nonetheless, but the population urged him to sue for peace. Duquesne agreed to a truce on condition that all Christian slaves were delivered to him.  When the truce expired, Hassan Dey asked for, and received, an extension.  Duquesne meanwhile set out his terms for agreeing a peace:

* freeing all Christian slaves 
* an indemnity equal to the value of all the goods seized from France by pirates 
* a solemn embassy to be sent to Louis XIV to ask his forgiveness for the hostile acts committed against his navy.  

These terms resolved the Dey to continue resistance.&lt;ref name="Michelant"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vallee-du-ciron.com/Documents/Ouvrages/Michelant/1683.Alger.htm|title=Bombardement d'Alger par Duquesne|last=Michelant |first=L. |date= |website=Faits mémorables de l'histoire de France |publisher= |access-date=21 April 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Supplice du consul de france pere levacher.JPG|left|thumb|Dutch engraving showing the death of Consul le Vacher, 1698]]
One of the Algerian commanders, [[Mezzo Morto Hüseyin Pasha]], then seized command and denounced the cowardice of the Dey, who had agreed to treat with the French.  He had him put to death and was acclaimed as his successor by the [[janissaries]]. Before long a red flag, raised from the heights of the [[Casbah]], announced to Duquesne that combat was resumed.&lt;ref name="Michelant"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vallee-du-ciron.com/Documents/Ouvrages/Michelant/1683.Alger.htm|title=Bombardement d'Alger par Duquesne|last=Michelant |first=L. |date= |website=Faits mémorables de l'histoire de France |publisher= |access-date=21 April 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Algerians replied to the bombs hurled at their city by tying the French consul, [[Jean Le Vacher]] to the mouth of a cannon.&lt;ref name="Panzac2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Panzac|title=The Barbary Corsairs: The End of a Legend, 1800-1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dyeFP5Hyc4C&amp;pg=PA33|year=2005|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-12594-9|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 28 July pieces of his shattered limbs fell on the decks of the French vessels, along with those of other French prisoners blown to pieces.&lt;ref name="Montrond1860"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clement Melchior Justin Maxime Fourcheux de Montrond|title=Les marins les plus celebres.

Despite the fierce resistance of the Algerians, the city was engulfed by an enormous fire which consumed palaces, mosques, and many other buildings across the city; the wounded could not find any refuge; and ammunition ran low. Algiers would have been reduced to ruins had not Duquesne himself run out of  missiles.  The bombardment ended on 29 July. 

The pride of the Algerian pirates was crushed, and as the French fleet returned to France, Algiers sent an embassy under Djiafar-Aga-Effendi to ask forgiveness of Louis XIV, for the injuries and cruelty that the corsairs had inflicted on France.&lt;ref name="Jamieson2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan G.

== Aftermath ==
The new Dey Mezzo Morto Hüseyin Pasha agreed to free another 546 captives,&lt;ref name="Eudel1902"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Eudel|title=L'orf?vrerie alg?rienne et tunisienne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQILAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35|year=1902|publisher=Рипол Классик|isbn=978-5-87318-342-5|pages=35–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Panzac2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Panzac|title=The Barbary Corsairs: The End of a Legend, 1800-1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dyeFP5Hyc4C&amp;pg=PA33|year=2005|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-12594-9|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; but refused to sign a peace agreement with Duquesne, who was then 79 years of age, so Louis XIV sent another envoy, [[Anne Hilarion de Tourville|Tourville]], to treat with him. A hundred year peace was agreed, including a provision to leave the coasts of France unmolested. Five years later, after Algiers violated the treaty, the French again bombarded the city. [[Jean II d'Estrées|Admiral d'Estrées]] obliged the Dey to seek a new peace agreement, signed on 27 September 1688, which the Algerians respected. Thereafter the corsair captains, though they avoided the coasts of France, continued their raids elsewhere, causing considerable damage to the coastal regions of Spain.&lt;ref name="Ministère663"&gt;France.

In the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|U.S. commonwealth]] of [[Pennsylvania]], a '''borough''' (sometimes spelled '''boro''') is a self-governing [[municipal]] entity, best thought of as a [[town]],&lt;ref name=BB6-61/&gt; usually smaller than a [[city]], but with a similar population density in its residential areas. 

==Description==
Boroughs also tend to have more developed business districts and concentrations of public and commercial office buildings, including court houses. Both are larger, less spacious, more developed than the relatively rural townships, which often have the greater territory and even surround boroughs of a related or even the same name. There are 958&amp;nbsp;boroughs and 56 cities in Pennsylvania, but only one town,&lt;ref name="manual 6-3"&gt;''The Pennsylvania Manual'', pp. 6–3.&lt;/ref&gt; the town of [[Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania|Bloomsburg]].
 
All municipalities in Pennsylvania are classified as either [[Local government in Pennsylvania#City|cities]], boroughs, or [[township (Pennsylvania)|townships]].&lt;ref name="manual 6-3"/&gt; The only exception is the town of Bloomsburg, which is recognized by state government as the only incorporated town in Pennsylvania&lt;ref name=BB6-61&gt;''The Pennsylvania Manual'', pp. 6–61.&lt;/ref&gt; and uses the distinction in its promotion. Many [[Home Rule Municipality (Pennsylvania)|home rule municipalities]] remain classified as boroughs or townships for certain purposes even if the state's Borough and Township Codes no longer apply to them.

== History ==
CfS was originally formed in 1994 to campaign against the removal of [[Clause IV]] from the Labour Party's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://reidfoundation.org/2013/07/scottish-labour-left-attacks-london-interference-in-falkirk-selection-process/|title=Scottish Labour Left attacks London interference in Falkirk Selection Process|date=4 July 2013|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, it was one of the only remaining ideological-based groupings in the party {{mdash}} but [[Gerry Hassan]] and Eric Shaw, writing that year, claimed that CfS "has few members, little organisational presence and has had a negligible influence on the direction of the party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Strange Death of Labour Scotland|page=259|last1=Hassan|first1=Gerry|last2=Shaw|first2=Eric|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780748655571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CfS played a key role in organising [[Neil Findlay]] and [[Katy Clark]]'s leadership bid in the [[Scottish Labour Party leadership election, 2014]]. Though unsuccessful, CfS claims the campaign "built the foundations for Jeremy [Corbyn]'s campaign just a few months later" by "giving many new, young volunteers experience and a network of contacts across the country that would help quickly mobilise an effective campaign".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scottishleftreview.org/article/how-the-contest-was-won/|title=How the contest was won|date=November 2015|accessdate=6 March 2017|publisher=[[Scottish Left Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, five CfS members won seats on the Scottish Labour Party's national executive.&lt;ref name="left" /&gt; They called for the then Scottish Labour leader, [[Kezia Dugdale]], to pursue a socialist agenda and work more closely with Jeremy Corbyn's team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15134386.Dugdale_loyalists_lost_out_in_Labour_internal_elections_over_bungled_campaign_approach/|title=Dugdale loyalists lost out in Labour internal elections over bungled campaign approach|last=Hutcheon|first=Paul|date=5 March 2017|accessdate=6 March 2017|work=[[Sunday Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8553">The '''chief privacy officer''' (CPO) is a senior level executive within a United States-based business or organization. "Consumer concerns over the use of personal information, including medical data and financial information along with laws and regulations",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chief Privacy Officer {{!}} DefineFinance|url = http://www.definefinance.com/chief-privacy-officer|website = www.definefinance.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the key reasons that the CPO role exists, as this was introduced to help keep personal information safe.

There is legislation in different sectors concerning the use of personal information. For example, in medical industry, the protection of patient medical records (e.g. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or [[HIPAA]]). Another example is in the finance sector with the safeguarding of consumer financial and banking transactions (e.g. The [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] and its Disposal Rule, and the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] and its Safeguards Rule and Financial Privacy Rule).

== History ==
In the United States, the position of chief information officer was first established at Acxiom Corporation in 1991 with the appointment of Jennifer Barrett as CPO,&lt;ref&gt;https://iapp.org/about/person/0011a00000DlPjEAAV/&lt;/ref&gt; with the second appointment of CPO at the Internet advertising firm [[AllAdvantage]] in August 1999, when it appointed privacy lawyer [[Ray Everett-Church]] to the newly created position, starting a trend that quickly spread among major corporations, both offline and online. The role of the Chief Privacy Officer was solidified within the U.S. corporate world in November 2000 with the naming of Harriet Pearson as Chief Privacy Officer for [[IBM|IBM Corporation]]. That event prompted one influential analyst to declare, "the chief privacy officer is a trend whose time has come." &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/IBM+appoints+chief+privacy+officer/2100-1001_3-249135.html news.com IBM appoints chief privacy officer]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2001, the non-profit research organization Privacy and American Business reported that a significant number of [[Fortune 500]] firms had appointed senior executives with the title or role of Chief Privacy Officer. The growth of the Chief Privacy Officer trend was further fueled by the European Union's passage in the late 1990s of [[information privacy|data privacy]] laws and regulations that included a requirement for all corporations to have an individual designated to be accountable for privacy compliance.

By 2002, the position of Chief Privacy Officer and similar privacy-related management positions were sufficiently widespread to support the creation of professional societies and trade associations to promote training and certification programs. In 2002 the largest of these organizations, the Privacy Officers Association and the Association of Corporate Privacy Officers, merged to form the International Association of Privacy Officers, which was later renamed the [[International Association of Privacy Professionals]] (IAPP). The IAPP holds several conferences and training seminars each year around the world, hosting association members from major global corporations and government agencies, with executives seeking certification programs in privacy management practices.

== Responsibilities &amp; Duties ==

Some of the key responsibilities that a CPO has to have are: being able to use business strategies and procedures and apply it to the business, being able to organize plans and lastly looking at privacy program reviews by checking and analyzing the information to ensure it is correct. They are also responsible for making sure data is secure from unauthorized users and making. They would also have to help to improve systems for auditing and monitoring, to therefore resolve any privacy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Current Openings|url = http://www.merkleinc.com/careers/current-openings?gnk=job&amp;gni=8a7880ec5088917c015090c5ff850d3a&amp;gns=Indeed&amp;source=indeed.com#.Vjj9xWvS7Tg|website = Merkle|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a CPO is responsible for all the privacy of the data in an organization, one major part of their job is to avoid [[Data breach|data breaches]], especially if the organization is a large corporation. However some major companies have been hacked and have data breaches.

These include:
*[[eBay]] -  up to 145 million customers affected &lt;ref name="infoisbeautiful"&gt;{{Cite web|title = World’s Biggest Data Breaches &amp; Hacks {{!}} Information is Beautiful|url = http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/|website = www.informationisbeautiful.net|accessdate = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Target Corporation|Target]] -  up to 70 million customers affected &lt;ref name="infoisbeautiful" /&gt;
*[[Home Depot]] - up to 56 million customers affected &lt;ref name="infoisbeautiful" /&gt;
*[[Anthem (company)|Anthem]] - up to 80 million customers affected &lt;ref name="infoisbeautiful" /&gt;
*[[JPMorgan Chase|JP Morgan Chase]] - up to 76 million customers affected &lt;ref name="infoisbeautiful" /&gt;

Data breaches are commonly high-profile events and not only the reputation of the CPO will be affected but also the company's reputation, impacting consumer confidence.

== Qualities  ==
One key quality a CPO will need to have is being good at communicating,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 7 habits of highly effective CPOs - Supply Business|url = http://www.supplybusiness.com/previous-articles/winter-2009-2010/features/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-cpos/|website = www.supplybusiness.com|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; because poor communication could lead to a leakage of data which the CPO would be accountable for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Government Chief Privacy Officer {{!}} ICT.govt.nz|url = https://www.ict.govt.nz/governance-and-leadership/the-gcio-team/government-chief-privacy-officer/|website = www.ict.govt.nz|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another quality a CPO should have is staying aware of any new developments and risks in the field.

== Benefits and drawbacks ==
There are some major benefits to having a CPO in your organization. The first would be that they help to keep data secure, so this ensures that security of data is not compromised.  Another benefit is that they help develop policies which is why "''30% of CPOs are attorneys''" and "''15% are in the information security department''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why your company needs a chief privacy officer|url = http://www.networkworld.com/article/2290212/lan-wan/why-your-company-needs-a-chief-privacy-officer.html|website = Network World|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this means that CPO can legally help to ensure that the data stays secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chief Privacy Officer|url = https://hbr.org/2000/11/chief-privacy-officer|website = Harvard Business Review|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of what industries a CPO can be beneficial, a CPO would be favorable in almost every sector. For example, the finance sector is perhaps one of the main areas where you are dealing with consumer information. It's not just the finance sector, basically anywhere you have and store customers information, a CPO would be a good idea as they will help to ensure that customers data is safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Does Your Company Need A Chief Privacy Officer?|url = http://www.informationintersection.com/2012/10/does-your-company-need-a-chief-privacy-officer/|website = Information Intersection|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some drawbacks to having a CPO in your organization, the first being cost. According to [[payscale.com]] the average salary for a CPO in the United States is over 6 figures, roughly about $107,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chief Privacy &amp; Security Officer Salary|url = http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Chief_Privacy_%2526_Security_Officer/Salary|website = www.payscale.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another drawback to having a CPO in your business would be that some may argue that it's just too much power for one person to have, especially if they are dealing with personal information{{who|date=November 2015}}.

[[Christianity]] is targeted by critics of colonialism because the tenets of the religion were used to justify the actions of the [[colonists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jake |last=Meador |title=Cosmetic Christianity and the Problem of Colonialism – Responding to Brian McLaren |url=http://notesfromasmallplace.wordpress.com/2010/09/17/cosmetic-christianity-and-the-problem-of-colonialism-responding-to-brian-mclaren/|accessdate=2010-11-17 |quote=According to Jake Meador, "some Christians have tried to make sense of post-colonial Christianity by renouncing practically everything about the Christianity of the colonizers.

Boer of the Sudan United Mission as saying, "Colonialism is a form of imperialism based on a divine mandate and designed to bring liberation - spiritual, cultural, economic and political - by sharing the blessings of the Christ-inspired civilization of the West with a people suffering under satanic oppression, ignorance and disease, effected by a combination of political, economic and religious forces that cooperate under a regime seeking the benefit of both ruler and ruled."&lt;ref name=Falola /&gt;

Edward Andrews writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Historians have traditionally looked at Christian missionaries in one of two ways. The first church historians to catalogue missionary history provided hagiographic descriptions of their trials, successes, and sometimes even martyrdom. Missionaries were thus visible saints, exemplars of ideal piety in a sea of persistent savagery.  However, by the middle of the twentieth century, an era marked by civil rights movements, anti-colonialism, and growing secularization, missionaries were viewed quite differently. Instead of godly martyrs, historians now described missionaries as arrogant and rapacious imperialists. Christianity became not a saving grace but a monolithic and aggressive force that missionaries imposed upon defiant natives. Indeed, missionaries were now understood as important agents in the ever-expanding nation-state, or "ideological shock troops for colonial invasion whose zealotry blinded them."&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Jake Meador, "some Christians have tried to make sense of post-colonial Christianity by renouncing practically everything about the Christianity of the colonizers. They reason that if the colonialists’ understanding of Christianity could be used to justify rape, murder, theft, and empire then their understanding of Christianity is completely wrong.

According to Lamin Sanneh, "(m)uch of the standard Western scholarship on Christian missions proceeds by looking at the motives of individual missionaries and concludes by faulting the entire missionary enterprise as being part of the machinery of Western cultural imperialism."  As an alternative to this view, Sanneh presents a different perspective arguing that "missions in the modern era have been far more, and far less, than the argument about motives customarily portrayed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Christian Century |date=April 8, 1987 |pages=331–334 |publisher=The Christian Century Foundation |title=Christian Missions and the Western Guilt Complex |first=Lamin |last=Sanneth |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=143 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Wood asserts that the [[indigenous peoples]] were not considered to be human beings and that the colonisers was shaped by "centuries of [[Ethnocentrism]], and [[Christian monotheism]], which espoused one truth, one time and version of reality."&lt;ref&gt;Conquistadors, Michael Wood, p. 20, BBC Publications, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age of Discovery==

{{Further|Colonialism|Age of Discovery|Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery}}
[[Image:Convento san agustin 2.jpg|thumb|200px| The convent of San Augustin. A mission centre established at Yuriria, Mexico in 1550]]

During the [[Age of Discovery]], the [[Catholic Church]] inaugurated a major effort to spread Christianity in the New World and to convert the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and other indigenous people. The missionary effort was a major part of, and a partial justification for the colonial efforts of European powers such as [[Spain]], [[France]] and [[Portugal]].  Christian [[Mission (Christian)|Missions]] to the indigenous peoples ran hand-in-hand with the colonial efforts of Catholic nations. In the Americas and other colonies in Asia and Africa, most missions were run by religious orders such as the [[Augustinians]], [[Franciscans]], [[Jesuits]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]].

In both [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], religion was an integral part of the state and evangelization was seen as having both secular and spiritual benefits.  Wherever these powers attempted to expand their territories or influence, missionaries would soon follow.  By the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], the two powers divided the world between them into exclusive spheres of influence, trade and colonization.  The Roman Catholic world order was challenged by the [[Netherlands]] and [[England]]. Theoretically, it was repudiated by [[Grotius]]'s ''Mare Liberum''.  Portugal's and Spain's colonial policies were also challenged by the Roman Catholic Church itself. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] founded the [[Congregatio de Propaganda Fide]] in 1622 and attempted to separate the churches from the influence of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] kingdoms.

==Americas==

Jan van Butselaar writes that "for [[Prince Henry the Navigator]] and his contemporaries, the colonial enterprise was based on the necessity to develop European commerce and the obligation to propagate the Christian faith."&lt;ref name=vanButselaar&gt;{{cite book |title=Bridge or barrier: religion, violence, and visions for peace, Volume 2001 |editors=Gerrie ter Haar, James J. Busuttil |publisher=BRILL |year=2005 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian leaders and Christian doctrines have been accused of justifying and perpetrating violence against Native Americans found in the New World.&lt;ref name="Carroll, Vincent p 87"&gt;Carroll, Vincent, ''Christianity on trial: arguments against anti-religious bigotry'', p 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish missionaries===

Adriaan van Oss wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If we had to choose a single, irreducible idea underlying Spanish colonialism in the New World, it would undoubtedly be the propagation of the Catholic faith.  Unlike such other European as England or the Netherlands, Spain insisted on converting the natives of the lands it conquered to its state religion.  Miraculously, it succeeded.  Introduced in the context of Iberian expansionism, Catholicism outlived the empire itself and continues to thrive, not as an anachronistic vestige among the elite, but as  a vital current even in remote mountain villages.  Catholicism remains the principal colonial heritage of Spain in America.  More than any set of economic relationships with the outside world, more even than the language first brought to America's shores in 1492, the Catholic religion continues to permeate Spanish-American culture today, creating an overriding cultural unity which transcends the political and national boundaries dividing the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Catholic Colonialism: A Parish History of Guatemala, 1524-1821 |first=Adriaan C. |last=van Oss }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Spaniards were committed, by Vatican decree, to convert their [[New World]] indigenous subjects to Catholicism. However, often initial efforts were questionably successful, as the indigenous people added [[Catholicism]] into their longstanding traditional ceremonies and beliefs.  The many native expressions, forms, practices, and items of art could be considered idolatry and prohibited or destroyed by Spanish missionaries, military, and civilians. This included religious items, sculptures, and jewelry made of gold or silver, which were melted down before shipment to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brenda |last=Golden |title=A Native Take on Terrorism, the Towers and Tolerance |date=2010-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Spanish did not impose their language to the extent they did their religion, some [[indigenous languages of the Americas]] evolved into replacement with Spanish, and lost to present day tribal members. When more efficient they did evangelize in native languages. Introduced writing systems to the Quechua, Nahuatl and Guarani peoples may have contributed to their expansion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In the early years most mission work was undertaken by the religious orders. Over time it was intended that a normal church structure would be established in the mission areas. The process began with the formation of special jurisdictions, known as apostolic prefectures and apostolic vicariates. These developing churches eventually graduated to regular diocesan status with the appointment of a local bishop. After [[decolonization]], this process increased in pace as church structures altered to reflect new political-administrative realities.
&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, Adrian, ''A World History of Christianity'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000, pp 330-349&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralph Bauer describes the Franciscan missionaries as having been "unequivocally committed to Spanish imperialism, condoning the violence and coercion of the Conquest as the only viable method of bringing American natives under the saving rule of Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Finding colonial Americas: essays honoring J.A. Leo Lemay |first=Ralph |last=Bauer |publisher=University of Delaware Press |year=2001 |page=35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jordan writes "The catastrophe of Spanish America's rape at the hands of the Conquistadors remains one of the most potent and pungent examples in the entire history of human conquest of the wanton destruction of one culture by another  in the name of religion"&lt;ref&gt;"In the Name of God : Violence and Destruction in the World's Religions", M. Jordan, 2006, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio de Montesinos (Dominican friar)|Antonio de Montesinos]], a Dominican [[friar]] on the island of [[Hispaniola]], was the first member of the clergy to publicly denounce all forms of enslavement and oppression of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanke, Lewis. (1946) Free Speech in Sixteenth-Century Spanish America. ''The Hispanic American Historical Review'', 26,2:135-149. Page 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians such as [[Francisco de Vitoria]] and [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] drew up theological and philosophical bases for the defense of the [[human rights]] of the colonized native populations, thus creating the basis of [[international law]], regulating the relationships between nations.

===French missions===
{{main|French colonization of the Americas|France Équinoxiale|Protectorate of missions}}

The French colonial effort began later than that of the Spanish or Portuguese.

::Hawaii - The French Incident (1839)
Under the rule of Ka{{okina}}ahumanu the newly converted Protestant widow of Kamehameha the Great, Catholicism was illegal in Hawaii and chiefs loyal to her forcibly deported French priests onto the ''Artemise''. [[Native Hawaiian]] Catholic converts were imprisoned and [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions#Early missions|Protestant ministers]] ordered them to be tortured.  The prejudice against the French Catholics missionaries remained the same under the reign of her successor, the [[Kuhina Nui]] [[Ka'ahumanu II]].
In 1839 [[Cyrille Pierre Théodore Laplace|Captain Laplace]] of the French frigate ''Artémise'' sailed to Hawaii under orders to:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Destroy the malevolent impression which you find established to the detriment of the French name; to rectify the erroneous opinion which has been created as to the power of France; and to make it well understood that it would be to the advantage of the chiefs of those islands of the Ocean to conduct themselves in such a manner as not to incur the wrath of France. You will exact, if necessary with all the force that is yours to use, complete reparation for the wrongs which have been committed, and you will not quit those places until you have left in all minds a solid and lasting impression.{{Cite quote|date=October 2009}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Asia and the Far East==
Christian missionaries had mixed success in the Far East. After initial success in Japan, the government crackdown and destroy the Christian missions; they never recovered.  In China there was limited success in some places. In India, the British missionaries were often in conflict with British administrators and businessmen. Missionaries had moderate success among the scheduled classes. In French-controlled Vietnam, and a Japanese-controlled Korea, the Christian missionaries had significant success in terms of membership.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Hugh Moffett, ''A History of Christianity in Asia, Vol. II: 1500-1900'' (2003)
 [https://www.amazon.com/History-Christianity-Asia-Vol-1500-1900/dp/1570757011/ online].&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity had a more subtle effect, reaching far beyond the converted population to potential modernizers. The introduction of European medicine was especially important, as well as the introduction of European political practices and ideals ideals such as  religious liberty, mass education, mass printing, newspapers, voluntary organizations, colonial reforms, and especially liberal democracy. &lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Woodberry, "The missionary roots of liberal democracy." ''American Political Science Review'' 106#2 (2012): 244-274.  [http://www.hillcountryinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/missionaryrootsofliberaldemocracy.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==

Christian evangelists were intimately involved in the colonial process in southern Africa.&lt;ref name=Sharkey&gt;{{cite journal |title=Christianity and Colonialism in South Africa b|first1=Jean |last1=Comaroff |first2=John |last2=Comaroff |journal=American Ethnologist |volume=13 |year=1986 |pages=1–22 |issue=1 |doi=10.1525/ae.1986.13.1.02a00010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Portuguese sent missions into Africa.

In the mid-19th century, [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missions were engaged in active missionary work on the Guinea coast, in South Africa and in the Zanzibar dominions. Missionaries visited little-known regions and peoples, and in many instances became explorers and pioneers of trade and empire. [[David Livingstone]], a Scottish missionary, had been engaged since 1840 in work north of the [[Orange River]].

According to Heather Sharkey, the real impact of the activities of the missionaries is still a topic open to debate in academia today.  Sharkey asserted that "the missionaries played manifold roles in colonial Africa and stimulated forms of cultural, political and religious change."  "Historians still debate the nature of their impact and question their relation to the system of European colonialism in the continent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Religion in colonial Africa |first=Taimur |last=Khan |date=2002-10-29 |accessdate=2010-11-17 |url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2002/10/religion_in_colonial_africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sharkey, some observers believe that the missionaries did great good in Africa, providing crucial social services such as education and health care that would have otherwise not been available to the Africans. Sharkey said that, in societies that were traditionally male-dominated,  female missionaries provided women in Africa with health care knowledge and basic education.&lt;ref name=Sharkey /&gt;

'''Iqela Lentsango: The Dagga Party of South Africa''' (more commonly known as the '''Dagga Party''') is a [[South Africa]]n political party founded in February 2009 by Jeremy Acton, who remains the party's leader.

'''Derogation''' is the partial suppression of a law,&lt;ref name=DellaRocca&gt;Manual of Canon Law, pg. 69&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to [[Repeal|abrogation]]—total abolition of a law by explicit [[repeal]]—and [[obrogation]]—the partial or total modification or repeal of a law by the imposition of a later and contrary one.  The term is used in [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]],&lt;ref name=DellaRocca/&gt; [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and [[common law]].  It is sometimes used, loosely, to mean abrogation, as in the legal maxim: ''Lex posterior derogat priori'', i.e. a subsequent law imparts the abolition of a previous one.

Derogation differs from [[dispensation (canon law)|dispensation]] in that it applies to the law, whereas dispensation applies to specific people affected by the law. 

==Canon law==
{{main|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
{{see also|Jurisprudence of canon law}}
That is to say, in canon law a ''dispensation'' affirms the validity of a law, but asserts that the law will not be held to apply to one or more specific persons, for a specific reason. (For example, while the Catholic Church's canon law does not normally recognise gender transition, an [[intersex]] woman may present appropriate medical documentation to seek, and possibly receive, a dispensation from the Holy See to live and be recognised as a man, or vice versa.) ''Derogation'', on the other hand, affects the ''general'' applicability of a law. 

A non-canon-law analogue of dispensation might be the issuing of a [[zoning variance]] to a particular business, while a general rezoning applied to all properties in an area is more analogous to derogation.

==European Union law==
{{main|European Union law}}
In terms of [[European Union]] legislation, a derogation can also imply that a member state delays the implementation of an element of an EU [[Regulation (European Union)|Regulation]] (etc.) into their legal system over a given timescale,&lt;ref&gt;[http://esharp.eu/jargon/derogation/ Derogation – EU Jargon]&lt;/ref&gt; such as five years; or that a member state has opted not to enforce a specific provision in a treaty due to internal circumstances (typically a state of emergency).

'''Diepreye Solomon Peter Alamieyeseigha''' ("DSP") (16 November 1952 – 10 October 2015) was a Nigerian politician who was [[List of Governors of Bayelsa State|Governor]] of [[Bayelsa State]] in [[Nigeria]] from 29 May 1999 to 9 December 2005.

==Background==

Diepreye Alamieyeseigha was born on 16 November 1952 in [[Amassoma]], [[Ogboin North]] [[Local Government Areas of Nigeria|Local Government Area]], [[Bayelsa State]]. He attended the Bishop Dimeari Grammar School, [[Yenagoa]]. He joined the Nigerian Defence Academy as a Cadet Officer in 1974, then joined the Nigerian Air Force, where he served in the department of Logistics and Supply. He held various air force positions in [[Enugu]], [[Makurdi]], [[Kaduna]] and [[Ikeja]]. Alamieyeseigha retired from the air force in 1992 as a Squadron Leader.&lt;ref name=newsprof&gt;{{cite web

After leaving the air force he became the Sole Administrator of Pabod Supplies Port Harcourt. Later he became Head of Budget, Planning, Research and Development of the National Fertiliser Company (NAFCON).&lt;ref name=newsprof/&gt;

==Governor of Bayelsa State==

Diepreye Alamieyeseigha was elected as Governor of Bayelsa State in May 1999 as a member of the ruling [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]] (PDP). He was re-elected in 2003.&lt;ref name=Basel&gt;{{cite web

==Corruption charges==

===United Kingdom===
Diepreye Alamieyeseigha was detained in London on charges of money laundering in September 2005.
At the time of his arrest, Metropolitan police found about £1m in cash in his London home.
Later they found a total of £1.8m ($3.2m) in cash and bank accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He was found to own four homes in London&lt;ref name =icij /&gt; worth an alleged £10 million.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} 
His state's monthly federal allocation for the last six years has been in the order of £32 million.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
He jumped bail in December 2005 from the [[United Kingdom]] by allegedly disguising himself as a woman, though Alamieyeseigha denies this claim.&lt;ref name=BBCprof&gt;{{cite web

Alamieyeseigha was impeached on allegations of corruption on 9 December 2005.&lt;ref name=Basel/&gt;

===Nigeria===

On July 26, 2007, Alamieyeseigha pleaded guilty before a Nigerian court to six charges and was sentenced to two years in prison on each charge; however, because the sentences were set to run concurrently and the time was counted from the point of his arrest nearly two years before the sentences, his actual sentence was relatively short. Many of his assets were ordered to be forfeited to the Bayelsa state government. According to Alamieyeseigha, he only pleaded guilty due to his age and would have fought the charges had he been younger.&lt;ref&gt;Adesina Aiyekoti, [http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/news/national/2007/july/27/national-27-07-2007-001.htm "Corruption: Alamieyeseigha pleads guilty, bags 12 years jail term"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083225/http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/news/national/2007/july/27/national-27-07-2007-001.htm |date=2007-09-29 }}, ''Daily Sun'' (Nigeria), July 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 27, just hours after being taken to prison, he was released due to time already served.&lt;ref name=IHT&gt;{{cite web

In April 2009, Alamieyeseigha pledged a donation of 3,000,000 naira to the Akassa Development Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pronatura-nigeria.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In December 2009, the federal government hired a British law firm to help dispose of four expensive properties acquired by Alamieyeseigha in [[London]]. Alamieyeseigha had bought one of these properties for £1,750,000.00 in July 2003, paying in cash. Diepreye Solomon Peter Alamieyeseigha used it as his London residence, and as the registered office of 
Solomon and Peters Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===United States===

On June 28, 2012, the United States (US) Department of Justice (DoJ) announced that it had executed an asset forfeiture order on $401,931 in a Massachusetts brokerage fund, traceable to Alamieyeseigha. US prosecutors filed court papers in April 2011 targeting the Massachusetts brokerage fund and a $600,000 home in Rockville,&lt;ref name=icij&gt;{{cite news

A motion for default judgement and civil forfeiture was granted by a Massachusetts federal district judge in early June 2012. The forfeiture order was the first to be made under the DoJ’s fledgling [[Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/June/12-crm-827.html|title=Department of Justice Forfeits More Than $400,000 in Corruption Proceeds Linked to Former Nigerian Governor|website=www.justice.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Pardon===

On 12 March 2013, Alamieyeseigha was [[pardon]]ed by President [[Goodluck Jonathan]], but his pardoning was criticised by many.&lt;ref name=ThePunch&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.punchng.com/news/outrage-over-presidential-pardon-for-vip-ex-convicts/ |title=Outrage over presidential pardon for VIP ex-convicts |author=Olusola Fabiyi |author2=Olalekan Adetayo |last-author-amp=yes |newspaper=[[The Punch]] |publisher=Ajibola Ogunsola |date=13 March 2013 |accessdate=14 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314190727/http://www.punchng.com/news/outrage-over-presidential-pardon-for-vip-ex-convicts/ |archivedate=14 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanguard(Nigeria)&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/03/no-apologies-over-pardon-for-alamieyeseigha-others-presidency/ |title=No apologies over pardon for Alamieyeseigha, others – Presidency |author= |newspaper=[[Vanguard (Nigeria)]] |publisher=Vanguard Media |date=14 March 2013 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dongzhou protests''' refers to a series of protests that took place for seven months until December 2005 in [[Dongzhou, Guangdong|Dongzhou]] (东洲), a village in [[Shanwei]] [[prefecture-level city|prefecture]], [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]], [[China]]. The protests were organized in opposition to government plans to partially [[infill]] the bay and build a new power plant. It resulted in the shooting deaths of several villagers in the night of 6 December 2005 by [[People's Armed Police]]. The death toll is unknown, with different sources mentioning anywhere from three to several dozen deaths. The protests resumed in November 2006.

==Incident==

The protests were held because local farmers were dissatisfied with the lack of compensation for land expropriated for the construction of the plant. They are also reportedly concerned with the potential for harmful pollution affecting their crops, while fishermen felt their livelihood would be adversely affected by the modifications to the bay.

According to ''[[Xinhua]]'', the Information Office of the government of Shanwei described the incident as "serious violation of law", in which Huang Xijun, Lin Hanru and Huang Xirang led protesters in attacking police with knives, [[petrol bomb]]s, and other explosive devices.  Xinhua reported that the police fired warning shots but, in the confusion after nightfall, people were hit by mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gd.xinhuanet.com/gdnews/2005-12/11/content_5789418.htm |title=新华网广东频道 - 广东省汕尾市红海湾开发区发生严重违法事件 |publisher=Gd.xinhuanet.com |date=2005-12-11 |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214105602/http://gd.xinhuanet.com/gdnews/2005-12/11/content_5789418.htm |archivedate=14 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local villagers denied these accounts, reported that the protesters may have used ordinary [[fireworks]] as part of their protest.  Villagers also alleged that the authorities had "enlisted thugs from local organized crime groups to help put down the demonstration" in addition to regular security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Protesters Say Police in China Killed Up to 20 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/10/world/asia/protesters-say-police-in-china-killed-up-to-20.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=10 December 2005 |accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village was sealed off by government forces who are searching for suspects involved in the violence and preventing people from leaving the village.{{update inline|?=yes|date=December 2015}}

==Casualties==
The official New China News Agency stated that three people had been killed and eight others injured, but there are other reports that quoted villagers saying as many as 20 people had been killed.

There are reports that local authorities are refusing to return bodies to families, in some cases offering money to villagers instead so that they would stop asking for the bodies. It is also reported that on 9 December, many villagers held incense sticks and knelt in front of police barricades in the village, asking for the bodies of their loved ones for proper burial. They have so far been refused. The ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' quoted some residents who said that the officials were attempting to hide the death toll. {{ref|QuoteHideDeathToll}}

On 11 December 2005, the Chinese government announced that a police commander was detained for mishandling the protest and causing deaths and injuries.{{ref|commanderDetained}} ''[[Ta Kung Pao]]'' reported on 13 December that, according to the Shanwei TV Station via [[Agence France Presse]], Wu Sheng, the vice director of the Shanwei Police Department, was placed in criminal detention by procurator bureau for mishandling the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.takungpao.com/news/05/12/13/ZM-496758.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215083413/http://www.takungpao.com/news/05/12/13/ZM-496758.htm |date=15 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to local television via ''[[The Washington Post]]'', nine residents were also arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/13/AR2005121302007.html |title=China Wavers on Police Shooting |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 14 December 2005|accessdate=2013-07-28 |first=Philip P. |last=Pan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, {{Update|date=December 2015}} the news has been followed closely by Hong Kong, Taiwan, dissident Chinese, and overseas media, but has received lesser coverage in [[mainland China]] media.

In June 2006, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that 19 villagers had been prosecuted for the unrest, 7 being given long sentences for disturbing public order and using explosives against the Police. This was taken to be evidence of the Chinese government covering up the true nature of the shootings. The trial was not widely reported on and locals said that they were constantly being pressured not to talk about what happened in 2005. Construction work resumed on the plant after the protests ended, with no compensation being handed out. No public investigation of the shootings has been carried out either.

In November 2006, the [[BBC]] reported that tension was again mounting in Dongzhou. The report stated that residents had taken eight local officials hostage after a villager was detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6157632.stm |title=Tense standoff in China village, BBC, 17 November, 2006 |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-11-19 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, [[Radio Free Asia]] reported that the officials had been released following a dawn raid by police, but more villagers had been detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/social/2006/11/19/china_shanwei |title=News Blackout in Dongzhou as Clampdown Continues, RFA, 19 November, 2006 |publisher=Rfa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, a similar event took place at another village in Guangdong, where villagers attempted to detain officials in a dispute over compensation for loss of farm land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/2006/11/30/china_hostages |title=Villagers Detained, Hostages Released in South China Land Clash, RFA, 30 November, 2006 |publisher=Rfa.org |date=2013-06-02 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly the events in Dongzhou are not an isolated case but part of an ongoing wave of protests against land grabs in China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6968-2004Oct4.html |title=China's Land Grabs Raise Specter of Popular Unrest, Washington Post, 5 Oct 2004 |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2004-10-05 |accessdate=2013-07-28 |first=Edward |last=Cody}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6135156.stm |title=China village fury at land grab, BBC Online, 10 Nov 2006 |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-11-10 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Prime Minister [[Wen Jiabao]] has acknowledged is an "historic error".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Saltzstein |first=Dan |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/01/20/news/china.php |title=In China, a warning on illegal land grabs, International Herald Tribune, 20 January, 2006 |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Galil Jewish–Arab School''' is the first joint [[Arab]]-[[Jew]]ish [[Primary education|primary school]] in [[Israel]], founded in 1998.  It is located on land owned by [[kibbutz]] [[Eshbal]], in the [[Misgav Regional Council|Misgav]] district of the [[Galilee]], near the [[Arab]] town of [[Sakhnin]].

[[Image:GalilSchoolSign.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The sign outside Galil School.]]

==History==
The Galil Jewish-Arab school was established in 1998 by the [[Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish Arab Education in Israel]], which also runs other bilingual schools in Israel.
In 2007, the school had a student body of 200 Jewish and Arab students ([[Jews]], [[Muslims]] and [[Christians]]) in Grades 1-9.  The students live in [[Sakhnin]], [[Sha'ab, Israel|Sha’ab]], and communities of the [[Misgav Regional Council]], whose populations have expressed support for bilingual, multicultural education.

==Educational model==
As in all Hand in Hand schools, Galil School strives to maintain an equal number of Arab and Jewish students; each class has two teachers, one Arab and one Jewish, the school has two co-principals, Arab and Jewish (currently Tagreed Hatib and Orna Eylat).

Hand in Hand's approach to [[bilingual education]] aims to create equality, understanding, and coexistence between the Arab and Jewish populations of Israel, who often live segregated from one another.  Classes at Hand in Hand schools are co-taught by an Arab and Jewish teacher, each teaching in  his or her native language.  Teachers do not translate, providing a strong incentive for students to attain fluency in the second language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/02/18/risrael_ed3_.php Judith Sudilovsky, "INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION/ A SPECIAL REPORT: Building bridges in Israel," ''International Herald Tribune'' (Paris), February 18, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The school exposes the students to all three cultures and demonstrates the principles of [[democracy]] and [[social equality]] in a straightforward and practical way.

'''Human rights in [[Madagascar]]''' are protected under the country's [[constitution]]. However the extent to which such rights are reflected in practice, is subject to debate. The 2009 Human Rights Report by the [[United States Department of State]] noted concerns regarding the suspension of democratic electoral processes as the result of recent political unrest.&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report"&gt;, [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/af/135962.htm 2009 U.S Dept of State Human Rights Report: Madagascar]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, reports of [[Political corruption|corruption]], arbitrary arrest and [[child labor]] highlight the prevalence of human rights issues in the country.&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawson H, Bertucci M.L, ''Encyclopedia of human rights'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1996. p.978&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitution and statutory responses==
{{update|the constitution - new constitution has been adopted|date=April 2013}}
Adopted in 1992, the [[Constitution of Madagascar]] addresses the notion of [[universal suffrage]], individual rights and the [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref name=cs&gt;{{csref|country=madagascar|author=Peter J. Schraeder|section=Constitution and Institutions of Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws regarding a minimum age for employment as well as the prohibition of child labor were passed.&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report" /&gt;

==Issues==
===Censorship===
Accusations of media [[censorship]] have risen due to the alleged restrictions on the coverage of government opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200904230849.html ''Madagascar: Media Under Attack One Month After New President Installed'', allafrica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; During the leadership conflict, Ravalomanana ordered the closure of "Viva TV", which was owned by his opponent, Rajoelina.&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report" /&gt;

===Equality===
Women's suffrage was officially recognized in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/suffrage.htm ''Women's Suffrage'', ipu.org]&lt;/ref&gt; However [[violence against women]] and [[human trafficking]] continues to be an issue in society.&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report" /&gt;

===Legal system===
The existence of key legal principles such as the [[rule of law]] and [[due process]], is in question due to the increase in arbitrary and politically motivated arrests in the after
In December 2014, the ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' indicated that children in Madagascar engaged in 3 activities namely vanilla production, stone quarrying, and sapphire mining.

===Poverty===
The people of [[Madagascar]] are inherently oppressed by extreme levels and rates of [[poverty]].  As of 2005, the Eastern coast of the country had astoundingly high poverty rates of around 80% while urban areas are just over 50%. &lt;ref&gt;[http://sk8es4mc2l.search.serialssolutions.com/?sid=sersol&amp;SS_jc=TC0001486750&amp;title=Republic%20of%20Madagascar%3A%20Poverty%20Reduction%20Strategy%20Paper%20Annual%20Progress%20Report ''Republic of Madagascar: Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper Annual Progress Report 2005'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 80% of the population lived on under $1.25 per day and over 90% of the population on under $2.00 per day as of 2010.  The country has seen major improvements in [[literacy]] rates.  Generally, a correlation exists between literacy rates and poverty.  Should the progress in increasing the number of literate Madagascans continue, poverty rates should begin to decline respectively. &lt;ref&gt;[https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/18250/781310PRIORITY0English0Apr900May012.pdf?sequence=5&amp;isAllowed=y ''Face of Poverty in Madagascar'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical situation==
The following chart shows Madagascar's ratings since 1972 in the [[Freedom in the World]] reports, published annually by [[Freedom House]]. A rating of 1 is "free"; 7, "not free".&lt;ref name='FH1972'&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW%20All%20Scores%2C%20Countries%2C%201973-2012%20%28FINAL%29.xls | title = Country ratings and status, FIW 1973-2012 | accessdate = 2012-08-22 | author = [[Freedom House]] | date = 2012 | format = XLS}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref|a|1}}

'''Industrial antiterrorism''' is a term coined in 2012 by the union of [[military]] and engineering standards.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Industrial terrorism is [[terrorism]] whose sole purpose is to strike at the heart of the [[business]] and [[critical infrastructure]] of a nation. It aims to create the greatest amount of economic damage possible, thus causing a strong impact on national and [[public opinion]] internationally. Such activity raises the need to create [[Technical standard|industry standards]] to provide some protection against [[terrorist attack]]s.

When more infrastructure and companies are protected by antiterrorism standards, it becomes more expensive, and more time is necessary, to plan an attack on that entity. In this way, [[intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] and companies can put off an attack and buy time to identify the involved [[terrorist group]]s. Following the [[Madrid terrorist attacks|Madrid]] and [[London terrorist attack 2005|London]] terror attacks, certain companies and service providers in [[Terrorism in Europe|Europe]] are now required by law &lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri%20=%20CELEX:%2032008L0114:%20EN:%20NOT 2008/114/EC]&lt;/ref&gt; to formulate industrial antiterrorism protocols.

==Subjects==
The main areas subject to the adoption of anti-terrorism standards are:

* [[Nuclear terrorism|Nuclear]]

* [[Chemical terrorism|Chemical]]

* Energy

'''Intelligence Squared''' is a media company that stages live [[debates]] and other cultural events around the world. It was founded in 2002 in London where its head office is based,  and it now also operates in the [[US]], [[Australia]] and [[Hong Kong]]. The debates are held in the traditional Oxford style, with as many as 2,500 people attending some events. It produces video and podcast versions of them on a regular basis on [[YouTube]] and other platforms.

==History==
Intelligence Squared was founded by two media entrepreneurs, [[Jeremy O'Grady]] and John Gordon, in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/mar/28/britishidentity|title=How the chattering classes turned to talk|first1=Neal|last1=Acherson|newspaper=The Observer|date=March 28, 2004|accessdate=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the company was bought by art consultant Amelie von Wedel, CEO of Serpentine Galleries [[Yana Peel]], and Commonwealth Bank of Australia Executive General Manager David Legg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who We Are : Intelligence Squared |url=https://www.intelligencesquared.com/who-we-are/ |website=intelligencesquared.com |publisher=Intelligence Squared}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah Kaye has been executive producer since 2006 and Matt McAllester became managing director in 2018.

As well as debates, Intelligence Squared also hosts talks and interviews with such figures as President [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Eric Schmidt]], [[Sheryl Sandberg]], [[Malala Yousafzai]], [[Patti Smith]] and [[Werner Herzog]]. It also stages discussions and panels. 

In 2006, Intelligence Squared US was established by the philanthropist and CEO of Delphi Financial Group [[Robert Rosenkranz]] through his foundation. It has hosted hundreds of debates across the US. Other Intelligence Squared licensees operate in [[Sydney]] (since 2008) and [[Hong Kong]] (since 2009). The company has also had partnerships in [[Kiev]] (2008 – 2014), [[Athens]] (2010), [[Israel]] (2013) and [[Chile]] (2014).

==Debates==
Intelligence Squared uses the traditional Oxford-style debating format. A motion is proposed, with two speakers arguing in favour and two against. Opening speeches are around  10 minutes in length. This is followed by Q and A from the floor and a lively dialogue between the speakers and short closing remarks. The audience is polled on their opinion both before and after the debate in order to see which side has changed the most audience members' minds.

Themes covered by the debates include "Foreign Policy", "History &amp; Social Policy", "Politics &amp; Economics", "Science &amp; Technology", "Art &amp; Culture", and "Environment".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.intelligencesquared.com/video-search/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strand is the "Cultural Combat" debates, in which two cultural figures are pitted against each other. These began in 2013 with "Verdi vs. Wagner", which was staged at London’s [[Royal Opera House]] with a sixty-piece live [[orchestra]], [[Stephen Fry]] in the chair, and [[John Tomlinson (bass)|John Tomlinson]] singing [[Wotan]].

==Podcast and video==
All Intelligence Squared events are recorded and released on the company’s YouTube channel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intelligence Squared YouTube channel |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/iqsquared |website=youtube.com |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as part of a weekly podcast series which has nearly half a million monthly listeners. The company also records standalone podcasts with authors and other intellectuals.

==Intelligence Squared on TV==
Intelligence Squared debates have also been broadcast globally on [[BBC World]].

==Intelligence Squared in the US==
In September 2006, Intelligence Squared U.S., was launched by [[Robert Rosenkranz]], an initiative of The Rosenkranz Foundation, a non-profit organization. IQ2US debates have aired on the [[Bloomberg Television]] network. From 2006 to 2012, IQ2US was distributed by NPR,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NPR ends distribution of ‘Intelligence Squared U.S.’ |url=https://current.org/2015/06/npr-ends-distribution-of-intelligence-squared-u-s/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is currently self-distributed through the Public Radio Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PRX - Intelligence Squared U.S. |url=https://www.prx.org/series/34373-intelligence-squared-u-s}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Donvan]] of ABC News regularly moderates the debates.

==Partnerships==
Intelligence Squared has partnered with numerous organisations and companies. In 2012 the company produced the Versus debates with [[Google]]. The first debate, titled "It's Time to End the War on Drugs", was held on 13 March 2012. The second Versus event was "Hip-hop On Trial". Intelligence Squared has also staged events in partnership with [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] on topics related to climate change and sustainable energy use. Other partnerships include [[The National Trust]], [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]], [[Abbey Road Studios]], [[Baker McKenzie]] in [[New York City]], [[Investec]], [[Christie's]], the [[World Health Organization]] in New York, the [[United Nations]] in [[Geneva]], and the [[University of Chicago]].

'''John Garang de Mabior''' (June 23, 1945 – July 30, 2005) was a Sudanese politician and [[revolutionary]] leader. From 1983 to 2005, he led the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] during the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], and following a peace agreement he briefly served as [[Vice President of Sudan|First Vice President of Sudan]] from July 9, 2005 &lt;ref&gt;http://en.people.cn/200507/10/eng20050710_195278.html&lt;/ref&gt; until his death in a helicopter crash on July 30, 2005. A [[Developmental economics|developmental economist]] by profession, Dr. Garang was a major influence on the movement that led to the foundation of South Sudan.

==Early life and education==
A member of the [[Dinka people|Dinka]] ethnic group,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Omar Al-Bashir and Africa's Longest War|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PT-uCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=John+Garang+a+young+officer+from+Twic+Dinka&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j7fPd0T1c6&amp;sig=lXIUPTugim3sZdyZL1zsa7q4nTA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwA2oVChMI6Mr9zabyxwIVzoCSCh320gr_#v=onepage&amp;q=John%2520Garang%2520a%2520young%2520officer%2520from%2520Twic%2520Dinka&amp;f=false|publisher = Pen and Sword|date = 2015-04-30|isbn = 9781473828230|first = Paul|last = Moorcraft}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garang was born into a poor family in Wangulei village Twic East County in the upper Nile region of Sudan. An orphan by the age of ten, he had his fees for school paid by a relative, going to schools in [[Wau, Sudan|Wau]] and then [[Rumbek]]. In 1962 he joined the [[First Sudanese Civil War|first Sudanese civil war]], but because he was so young, the leaders encouraged him and others his age to seek an education. Because of the ongoing fighting, Garang was forced to complete his secondary education in [[Tanzania]]. After winning a scholarship, he went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics in 1969 from [[Grinnell College]] in [[Iowa]], United States.&lt;ref name="BBC Obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/02/world/africa/leaders-call-death-of-former-rebel-leader-a-great-loss-to-sudan.html|title=Leaders call death of former rebel leader a great loss to Sudan|last=|first=|date=2005-08-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was offered another scholarship to pursue graduate studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], but chose to return to Tanzania and study East African [[agricultural economics]] as a [[Thomas J. Watson Fellow]] at the [[University of Dar es Salaam]] (UDSM). At UDSM, he was a member of the [[University Students' African Revolutionary Front]]. However, Garang soon decided to return to Sudan and join the rebels.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. There is much erroneous reporting that Garang met and befriended [[Yoweri Museveni]], future president of Uganda, at this time; while both Garang and Museveni were students at UDSM in the 1960s, they did not attend at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prunier|first=Gérard|authorlink=Gérard Prunier|year=2009|title=Africa's World War: Congo, the Rwandan Genocide, and the Making of a Continental Catastrophe|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-537420-9}}, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1970, Garang was among one of the batches of [[Gordon Muortat Mayen]]'s soldiers, the then leader of the Anyanya liberation movement, sent to Israel for military training.

The civil war ended with the [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]] of 1972 and Garang, like many rebels, was absorbed into the Sudanese military.  For eleven years, he was a career soldier and rose from the rank of [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] to [[colonel]] after taking the [[United States Army Infantry School|Infantry Officers Advanced Course]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], United States. During this period he took four years academic leave and received a Master's degree in [[agricultural economics]] from Iowa State University (ISU).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} In 1981, he earned a PhD in Economics from [[Iowa State University]] (ISU).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.isualum.org/s/565/17/interior.aspx?sid=565&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2635&amp;cid=3570&amp;ecid=3570&amp;ciid=7208&amp;crid=0|title=A Voice for South Sudan|last=|first=|date=|website=Iowa State University Alumni Association|publisher=Iowa State University (ISU)|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?iframe&amp;page=imprimable&amp;id_article=23101|title=Sudanese students commemorate Garand death in US Iowa|last=Miller|first=Tim|date=2007-07-31|website=Sudan Tribune News|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1983, Col. Garang was serving as a senior instructor in the military academy in Wadi Sayedna 21&amp;nbsp;km from the centre of [[Omdurman]] where he instructed the cadets for more than four years. Later he was nominated to serve in the military research department at Army HQ in [[Khartoum]].

== Political ideology ==
Dr. Garang coined the philosophy of ‘[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfnhnDeUgpQ&amp;t=2046s Sudanism]’ which would be the guiding philosophy to a secular and multiethnic [[New Sudan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F4GPSZP0Fc |title=What is the government in view of Dr. John Garang|publisher=Sudanese Online |date=2012-03-27 |accessdate=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He believed, for the people of Sudan to live in cohesion, they must not separate themselves into the many existing ethnic factions present within the nation but, rather, to collectively renounce the belief that Arabness, Black African-ness, Islam or Christianity were to be the ultimate defining characteristics of Sudan. Rather, he willed that citizens should embrace all cultures of Sudan, and to unify under the one commonality they all share, being Sudanese.

==Rebel leader==
In 1983, Garang went to [[Bor town, Sudan|Bor]], ostensibly to pacify 500 southern government soldiers in Battalion 105 who were resisting being rotated to posts in the north. However, Garang was already part of a conspiracy among some officers in the Southern Command arranging for the defection of Battalion 105 to the anti-government rebels.  When the government attacked Bor in May and the battalion pulled out, Garang rode by an alternate route to join them in the rebel stronghold in Ethiopia.  By the end of July, Garang had brought over 3000 rebel soldiers under his control through the newly created  [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]]/Movement (SPLA/M), which was opposed to military rule and Islamic dominance of the country, and encouraged other army garrisons to mutiny against the [[Sharia|Islamic law]] imposed on the country by the government.&lt;ref name="battalion 105"&gt;[[Douglas H. Johnson|Johnson, D.]] ''The Root Causes of Sudan's Civil Wars'', Indiana University Press, 2003, pp. 61–2.&lt;/ref&gt;  This action marked the commonly agreed upon the beginning of the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], which resulted in one and a half million deaths over twenty years of conflict. Although Garang was Christian and most of southern Sudan is non-Muslim (mostly [[animist]]), he did not initially focus on the religious aspects of the war.
[[File:John Garang of Sudan.jpg|thumb|John Garang of Sudan]]

Garang had been fighting for a "New Sudan" since 1983. He was a strong advocate for national unity: minorities together formed a majority and therefore should rule. Together, Garang believed, they could replace President [[Omar al-Bashir]] with a government made up of representatives from “all tribes and religions in Sudan." His first real effort for the cause, under his command, occurred in July 1985 with the SPLA’s incursion into Kordofan.&lt;ref name="tester"&gt;Cockett, R., 2010, Sudan: Darfur and the Failure of an African State, Yale UP.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SPLA gained the backing of Libya, Uganda, and Ethiopia. Garang and his army controlled a large part of the southern regions of the country, named ''New Sudan''. He claimed his troops' courage came from "the conviction that we are fighting a just cause. That is something North Sudan and its people don't have." Critics suggested financial motivations to his rebellion, noting that much of Sudan's [[Petroleum|oil]] wealth lies in the south of the country.&lt;ref name="tester"/&gt;

In the spring of 1991, [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]]'s regime (in Ethiopia) was overthrown by the Khartoum backed Ethiopian rebels ([[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]]). Upon the rebels’ seizure of the government, they closed all SPLA training camps in Ethiopia and cut off the SPLA's arms supply, forcing the SPLA to return hundreds of thousands of Sudanese back to [[South Sudan]]. This disrupted military operations and leadership within the SPLA. However, this caused the West to reconsider relations with the SPLA – justifying their providing the SPLA with "non-lethal help."&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Flint, J. and Alex de Waal, 2008 (2nd Edn), Darfur: A New History of a Long War, Zed Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after, there was an attempted coup to oust Garang by senior SPLA commanders, [[Riek Machar]] and [[Lam Akol]], in August 1991. The splinter group led by Machar and Akol was named the [[SPLA-Nasir]]. The coup turned out to be premature – however, it did expose the deep ethnic divides within the SPLA.  The Southern Sudanese communities became more divided than ever before in their history. These organic divides among the Southern Sudanese communities were exacerbated by the deliberate "divide and rule" policies instituted by the regimes in Khartoum, in order to maintain their power over the Southern Sudanese peoples.

[[Image:John Garang in crowd.jpg|thumb|left|Garang in a crowd of supporters]]
Garang refused to participate in the 1985 interim government or the 1986 elections, remaining a rebel leader. However, the SPLA and government signed a peace agreement on January 9, 2005, in [[Nairobi]], in Kenya. On July 9, 2005, he was sworn in as the First-Vice-President - the second most powerful person in the country - following a ceremony in which he and President [[Omar al-Bashir]] signed a power-sharing constitution. Simultaneously, he became the premier in southern Sudan. This administration had limited autonomy for six years, at the end of which there would be a scheduled referendum regarding secession.  No Christian or southerner had ever held such a high government post. Commenting after this ceremony, Garang stated, "I congratulate the Sudanese people, this is not my peace or the peace of al-Bashir, it is the peace of the Sudanese people."

In the Hillcrest Hotel in [[Nairobi]] on New Year's Day 2003, there was a meeting between the SPLA and the [[Fur people]]. Garang asked two associates of [[Abdul Wahid al Nur]] (who later formed the [[Sudan Liberation Movement]]) to declare that the [[Fur people]] were with the SPLA – they refused.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

Over 15 months, starting in September 2003, [[Ali Osman]] and Garang met in private in [[Naivasha]]. Their secret meetings and negotiations lasted up until the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] (CPA) was initialed on New Year's Eve 2004.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

The CPA appeared to embody the vision of the "New Sudan" that Garang wanted. Within the CPA, power was split between the [[National Congress (Sudan)|National Congress Party]] and the [[Sudan People's Liberation Movement]] for six years, until 2010, with Garang as the first vice-president.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

As a leader, John Garang's democratic credentials were often questioned.  For example, according to Gill Lusk, "John Garang did not tolerate dissent and anyone who disagreed with him was either imprisoned or killed".&lt;ref name="BBC Obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2134220.stm|title=Obituary: John Garang|last=Phombeah|first=Gray|date=2005-08-03|website=BBC News|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his leadership, the SPLA was accused of human rights abuses.&lt;ref name="BBC Obituary"/&gt;

The ideological profile of SPLA was as shadowy as Garang himself.
He varied from Marxism to drawing support from Christian fundamentalists in the US.&lt;ref name="BBC Obituary"/&gt;

The [[United States State Department]] argued that Garang's presence in the government would have helped solve the [[Darfur conflict]] in western Sudan, but others consider these claims "excessively optimistic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Untimely Death| author=Reeves, Eric | work=[[The New Republic]] | url=http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w050801&amp;s=reeves080205 | date=2005-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President [[George W.

==Death==
In late July 2005, Garang died after the Ugandan presidential [[Mil Mi-17|Mi-172]] helicopter he was flying in crashed. He had been returning from a meeting in [[Rwakitura]] with long-time ally President [[Yoweri Museveni]] of Uganda. He did not tell the Sudanese government that he was going to this meeting and therefore did not take the presidential plane. In fact, Garang had said he was going to spend the weekend in [[New Kush|New Cush]], a small village near the Kenyan borders founded by Garang himself. To this day neither the identity of any other participants at the meeting nor its purpose, are known. 

After the helicopter had been missing for more than 24 hours, the Ugandan president notified the Sudanese government, which in turn contacted the SPLM for information. The SPLM responded that the helicopter Garang was taking had landed safely on an old SPLA training camp. The Sudanese state television duly reported this. A few hours later, Abdel Basset Sabdarat, Sudan's Information Minister, then appeared on TV to refute the earlier report that Garang's helicopter landed safely. It was, in fact, Yasir Arman, the SPLA/M spokesperson, who had told the government that Garang's plane had landed safely and his intention, in doing so, was to buy time for internal succession arrangements within the SPLA, before Garang's death was to be declared. Garang's plane crashed on Friday and he remained 'missing' throughout Saturday. During this time, the government believed he was still resolving his affairs in Southern Sudan. Finally, a statement released by the office of the Sudanese President, [[Omar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir|Omar el-Bashir]], confirmed that the Ugandan presidential helicopter had crashed into ''"a mountain range in southern Sudan because of poor visibility and this resulted in the death of Dr. John Garang DeMabior, six of his colleagues and seven Ugandan crew members".''&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20050801/ap_on_re_mi_ea/sudan_plane_missing&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Sudan Tribune John Garang's legacy was a major cornerstone in Sudan's fight for independence. Without Garang, many marginalized people of Africa, including that of Sudan would still be largely forgotten about in the modern world. 

[[File:Sudan Juba grave of John Garang 17jun2006.jpg|thumb|Grave of John Garang in [[Juba]], [[South Sudan]] - guarded by [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]]-soldiers]]
His body was flown to New Cush, a southern Sudanese settlement near the scene of the crash, where former rebel fighters and civilian supporters gathered to pay their respects to Garang. Garang's funeral took place on August 3 in [[Juba, Sudan|Juba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Sudan bids rebel leader farewell |work=BBC News   | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4126370.stm | date=2005-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His widow, [[Rebecca Nyandeng De Mabior]], promised to continue his work stating: ''In our culture we say "if you kill the lion, you see what the lioness will do".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Widow of Sudan's Garang Steps In to Continue His Mission| author=Wax, Emily |

===Rumors===
Both the Sudanese government and the head of the SPLA blamed the weather for the accident.  There are, however, doubts as to whether this was the true cause, especially among the rank and file of the SPLA.  Yoweri Museveni, the Ugandan President, stated that the possibility of "external factors" having played a role could not be eliminated.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The SPLM/SPLA Rumbek crisis, which took place in Rumbek from November 29 to December 1, 2004; one month before the signing of the CPA is also believed to have been a factor relevant to Dr. John Garang's death.

While the Sudanese people followed the Naivasha peace talks closely, with high hopes of freedom and democratic transformation, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) was rife with rumors and accusations of conspiracy relating to the removal of SPLM deputy Chairman, [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]], and his replacement with the young [[Nhial Deng Nhial]]. Nhial Deng Nhial was the son of the famous leader of the southern Sudanese, [[William Deng Nhial]], who had been assassinated by the Sudanese army in 1968. William Deng Nhial had led the [[Sudan African National Union]] (SANU) in exile, but had returned to Sudan to take part in the 1968 elections, shortly before he was killed.

The '''law of [[Gibraltar]]''' is a combination of [[Common law#History|common law]] 
and [[statute]], and is based heavily upon [[English law]].

The ''English Law (Application) Act'' of 1962 stipulates that English common law will apply to Gibraltar unless overridden by Gibraltar law. However, as Gibraltar is a [[self-governance|self-governing]] [[British overseas territories|British overseas territory]], it maintains its own independent [[tax law|tax status]] and its [[Gibraltar Parliament|parliament]] can enact laws independently of the [[United Kingdom]].

'''Liechtenstein [[passport]]s''' are issued to nationals of [[Liechtenstein]] for the purpose of international travel. The passport may also serve as proof of Liechtensteiner citizenship.{{cn|date=January 2014}}

==Physical appearance==
Liechtenstein passports are blue with the [[coat of arms of Liechtenstein]] emblazoned in the centre. The words "FÜRSTENTUM LIECHTENSTEIN" are inscribed above the coat of arms, with "REISEPASS" and the international [[biometric passport]] symbol below.

==Effect of Liechtenstein citizenship==
Citizens of Liechtenstein are allowed to reside in Switzerland. Additionally, as a member of the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA), citizens of Liechtenstein are permitted to take up residence in any EEA member state.

Citizens of EEA member states, which consist of the [[European Union]] and three of the four [[European Free Trade Association]] states ([[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], and [[Norway]]) enjoy the freedom to travel and work in any EEA country without a [[Visa (document)#Visa exemption schemes|visa]], although transitory dispositions{{clarify|date=January 2014}} may restrict the rights of citizens of new member states to work in other countries. These same rights apply to Switzerland through a series of [[Switzerland–European Union relations|bilateral agreements]].

==Visa requirements==
{{main|Visa requirements for Liechtenstein citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for Liechtenstein citizens.png|thumbnail|400px|right|Visa requirements for Liechtenstein citizens]]
As of October 2018, Liechtenstein citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 178 countries and territories, ranking the Liechtenstein passport 12th in the world according to the [[Henley &amp; Partners Visa Restrictions Index|Visa Restrictions Index]].

In 2017, The Liechtenstein nationality is ranked fourteenth in [[The Quality of Nationality Index|Nationality Index]] (QNI). This index differs from the [[Henley Passport Index|Visa Restrictions Index]], which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace &amp; stability, economic strength, and human development as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.de/nationalities-with-the-best-quality-of-life-2016-6?r=UK&amp;IR=T |title= The 41 nationalities with the best quality of life |date= 2016-02-06 |website=  www.businessinsider.de |access-date= 2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[Prime Ministers of Canada]] by [[religion|religious]] affiliation. It notes party affiliation after the name. All Canadian Prime Ministers have affiliations with [[Christianity]].

In early Canadian history, religion played an important role in politics. The [[Conservative Party of Canada (historic)|Conservative Party]] was composed mainly of [[Anglicans]] and conservative [[French Canadian|French-Canadian]] [[Catholics]] while the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] was backed by reform-minded [[French Canadian]] Catholics and non-Anglican [[English Canadian]]s due to their support in [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]]. In recent years, religion has played a background role in Canadian politics. Modern Prime Ministers have been reticent about discussing their faith.

==Boosting Britain==
In 2012, after visiting a range of different businesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hertsandessexobserver.co.uk/Business/Business-News/Campaigner-visits-Dunmow-business-30082012.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227224837/http://www.hertsandessexobserver.co.uk/Business/Business-News/Campaigner-visits-Dunmow-business-30082012.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 February 2014|title=Campaigner visits Dunmow business|date=30 August 2012|work=hertsandessexobserver.co.uk|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; she set up an online initiative named 'Boosting Britain' to encourage and promote new ideas and companies which were helping Britain. It covered [[infrastructure]], [[defence industry]], education as well as [[motivational]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boostingbritain.org/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225174020/http://boostingbritain.org/index.htm |archivedate=25 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conservativehome.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2014/02/from-louiseburfdons-to-boost-britains-quota-of-engineers-why-not-take-a-page-from-germanys-book.html|title=Louise Burfitt-Dons: To boost Britain’s quota of engineers, why not take a page from Germany’s book? - Conservative Home|work=conservativehome.com|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has suggested more honorary titles for engineers would help to bolster their image and help with the skills shortage&lt;ref name="conservativehome.com"/&gt; As of 2017, the website was unregistered and not connecting.

==Campaigning==
Since setting up [[Act Against Bullying]], Burfitt-Dons has been outspoken on the ill-effects of [[tribalism]] in society as a speaker and writer. She has advocated that tribalism is on the increase and has been taking effect in all forms of modern society leading to social unrest. Feeling the need to express what the public was confiding in her she designed a range of campaigns to promote human dignity and individuality in modern society.

She designed the "Cool to Be Kind" Campaign in 2000; two years later she founded the National Decency Campaign in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eparenting.co.uk/parenting/nationaldecencycampaign.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=13 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010140128/http://www.eparenting.co.uk/parenting/nationaldecencycampaign.shtml |archivedate=10 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2006, the "Grade Not Degrade" campaign. ''[[The Scotsman]]'' quoted her as suggesting ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' was legitimising the growing trend of bullying behaviour in classrooms around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hello |url=http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment.cfm?id=116102007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209012759/http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment.cfm?id=116102007 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 February 2007 |title=Violent soap operas and bullying behaviour on television shows harm children - The Scotsman |website=News.scotsman.com |date=2007-01-23 |accessdate=2016-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She spoke at the Conservative Women's Organisation Forum &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativewomen.org.uk/article.asp?art_id=63 |title=CWO News :: CWO Forum - Cyber Bullying |website=Conservativewomen.org.uk |date=2007-06-28 |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on [[cyber bullying]] claiming that today "children have to be as savvy as celebrities but without the pr support". In response to the growing trend of internet abuse she designed the CyberKind Campaign, which was launched on [[Remembrance Day]] (11 November) 2009.

Burfitt-Dons founded the [[UK Kindness Movement]] and co-founder of [[Kindness Day UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2010/11/12/kindness-day-uk-launches-13-november_n_7414126.html|title=Kindness Day UK Launches 13 November|date=12 November 2010|work=huffingtonpost.co.uk|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.responsesource.com/releases/rel_display.php?relid=60351|title=Tens of Thousands take up Kindness Across the UK|work=responsesource.com|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared on [[BBC Breakfast]] on the first Kindness Day UK on 13 November 2010 alongside [[Kathy Lette]] who claimed that English people were condescending and unfriendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70ymutgb1k0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101222157/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70ymutgb1k0 |archivedate=1 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007 she began campaigning on global warming and has said that "climate change may be the ultimate issue that unites us all". {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Awards==
In 2006 she was nominated as an Angel Hero for [[The My Hero Project]]. In May 2009 she was invited to become a [[Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in recognition of her work with children as well as to acknowledge her efforts as a campaigner and speaker on humanitarian and environmental issues. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Global warming==
Burfitt-Dons co-founded the Global Warming Alliance which was set up in January 2006 to find solutions to the crisis. On 2 December 2008, she launched the Global Warming Hotspot &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/globalwarminghotspot |title=Globalwarminghotspot : List of videos |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; channel on [[YouTube]]. She spearheaded the international Hot Women Campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoearth.info/links/Air/Climate/Policy_Actors/Non-Governmental_Organizations/welcome.asp|title=EcoEarth.Info Environment Links: Air/Climate/Policy Actors/Non-Governmental Organizations|date=21 April 2012|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421213159/http://www.ecoearth.info/links/Air/Climate/Policy_Actors/Non-Governmental_Organizations/welcome.asp|archivedate=21 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which encouraged women to become more active in [[climate change]] issues and reduce carbon emissions and significantly raised awareness of the differences between male and female thinking on the issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.edu/worldedu_posts/genders-climate-change-women-men-accept-global-warming |title=How the genders think about climate change: Women more likely than men to accept global warming - World leading higher education information and services |website=World.edu |date=2010-09-26 |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Scotsman'' quoted Burfitt-Dons' claims that "the relentless rise in CO2 emissions is incrementally raising planetary temperatures, increasing water vapour in the atmosphere with a commensurate rise in rainfall, and ever stronger wind patterns randomly occurring across the globe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Craig Brown |url=http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/environment/darling_buds_of_may_april_more_like_1_1962484 |title=Darling buds of May?

==Feminism==
Burfitt-Dons got involved with women's issues because of her charity work as a motivational speaker and mentor.

A '''minority religion''' is a [[religion]] held by a [[Minority group|minority]] of the population of a country, state, or region. Minority religions may be subject to [[Social stigma|stigma]] or [[discrimination]]. An example of a stigma is using the term [[cult]] with its extremely negative connotations for certain [[new religious movement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/115621228/Why-the-Bruderhof-is-not-a-cult-by-Bryan-Wilson|title=Why the Bruderhof is not a cult - by Bryan Wilson {{!}} Cult And Sect {{!}} Religion And Belief|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who belong to a minority religion may be subject to discrimination and prejudice, especially when the religious differences correlate with [[ethnic]] differences.

Laws are made in some countries to protect the rights of religious minorities, such as protecting the minorities' culture and to promote harmony with the majority.

==History==

===Formation===
The foundation of a new [[centre-left politics|centre-left]] political party was announced on 2 January 2015 by [[George Papandreou]], current President of the [[Socialist International]], outgoing [[Member of the Hellenic Parliament]] and former [[Prime Minister of Greece]], three weeks before the upcoming election to be held on 25 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_02/01/2015_545898|title=Papandreou to launch new party|work=[[Kathimerini]]|date=2015-01-02|accessdate=2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This confirmed Papandreou's split from the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK),&lt;ref name=reu2jan&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/02/us-greece-politics-idUSKBN0KB0VD20150102|title=Former Greek PM Papandreou sets up new party, complicating election outlook|agency=[[Reuters]]|last=MacKenzie|first=James|date=2015-01-02|accessdate=2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he had led until being replaced as leader by [[Evangelos Venizelos]] in March 2012.&lt;ref name=bi2jan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/greeces-upcoming-election-just-got-more-more-complicated-2015-1|title=Greece's Upcoming Election Just Got More More Complicated|date=2015-01-02|accessdate=2015-01-02|work=[[Business Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; PASOK officials immediately denounced Papandreou's move as an "unethical and irrational political act"., accusing Papandreou of fracturing PASOK and being motivated by personal ambition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/papandreous-return-to-politics-adds-a-wild-card-to-greek-election-1420224555|title=Papandreou’s Return to Greek Politics Adds New Wild Card to Election|last=Stamouli|first=Nektaria|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=2015-01-02|accessdate=2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reu2jan /&gt;

Five PASOK MPs were joined the new party, including Papandreou and former minister [[Filippos Sachinidis]], who will serve as the party’s media representative alongside former deputy minister [[Giorgos Petalotis]].&lt;ref name="kath3jan" /&gt; Other well known PASOK politicians who joined KIDISO included former [[Speaker of the Hellenic Parliament|parliamentary speaker]] [[Filippos Petsalnikos]] and former minister [[Dimitris Reppas]].&lt;ref name="kath3jan" /&gt;

====2015 Legislative Elections====
In the [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|January 2015 legislative election]], KIDISO received 2.46% of the national vote, thus failing to cross the 3% threshold to receive seats in the [[Hellenic Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ekloges.ypes.gr/current/v/public/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150126122621/http://ekloges.ypes.gr/current/v/public/index.htm |archivedate=2015-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 August 2015, PASOK officially ruled out a proposed electoral pact with KIDISO for the upcoming [[Greek legislative election, September 2015|September 2015 snap election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/200979/article/ekathimerini/news/pasok-rules-out-cooperating-with-papandreou-party|title=PASOK rules out cooperating with Papandreou party - Kathimerini|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 September 2015, Papanderou stated that financial restrictions meant that KIDISO had ruled out contesting the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/201108/article/ekathimerini/news/papandreou-party-will-not-contest-in-snap-vote|title=Papandreou party will not contest in snap vote - Kathimerini|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National-anarchism''' is a [[political radicalism|radical]], [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]], [[criticisms of Marxism|anti-Marxist]], and [[anti-statism|anti-statist]] ideology. National-anarchists advocate a [[post-capitalism|post-capitalist]], [[stateless society]] in which communities of different [[ethnic group|ethnic]] or [[race (human categorization)|racial]] groups would be free to develop [[separatism|separately]] in their own autonomous [[Neotribalism|tribal]] [[commune]]s.&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|Macklin|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanchez 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sanchez|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These "[[Permanent autonomous zone|national autonomous zones]]" would be [[Direct democracy|directly democratic]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualistic]] and [[Self-sustainability|self-sufficient]].

The term ''national-anarchism'' dates back as far as the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt; The few scholars who have studied national-anarchism conclude that it represents a further evolution in the thinking of the [[Radical right (Europe)|radical right]] rather than an entirely new dimension.&lt;ref name="Griffin 2003"&gt;{{Harvnb|Griffin|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BlackSun&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sykes 2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sykes|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; National-anarchism has elicited skepticism and outright hostility from both left- and right-wing critics. Some accuse national-anarchists of being [[white nationalism|white nationalists]] who promote [[separatism|ethnic and racial separatism]], while others argue they want the [[Radical chic#Terrorist chic|militant chic]] of calling themselves "anarchists" without the historical and philosophical baggage that accompanies such a claim.&lt;ref name="Sanchez 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sanchez|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sunshine 2008"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sunshine|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National-Anarchist Movement'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; was propounded since the late 1990s by [[Troy Southgate]].&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt;

==History==
The term ''national-anarchist'' dates back as far as the 1920s, when Helmut Franke, a German conservative revolutionary writer, used it to describe his political stance. However, it would be the writings of other members of the [[Conservative Revolutionary movement|conservative revolutionary movement]], such as [[Ernst Jünger]], which would later provide the philosophical foundation of the contemporary National-Anarchist Movement.&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt;

In the mid-1990s, [[Troy Southgate]], a former member of the British far-right [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] and founder of the [[International Third Position]], began to move away from [[Strasserism]] and [[distributism|Catholic distributism]] towards [[post-left anarchy|post-left anarchism]] and the [[anarcho-primitivism|primitivist]] [[green anarchism]] articulated in [[Richard Hunt (editor)|Richard Hunt]]'s 1997 book ''To End Poverty: The Starvation of the Periphery by the Core''.&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt; However, he fused his anarchist ideology with the [[Julius Evola#Philosophy|radical traditionalism]] of Italian esotericist [[Julius Evola]] and the [[ethnopluralism]] and [[pan-European nationalism]] of [[Nouvelle Droite|French new right]] philosopher [[Alain de Benoist]] to create a newer form of national-anarchism.&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt;

In 1998, inspired by the concepts of the political soldier and [[leaderless resistance]], Southgate formed the National Revolutionary Faction (NRF) as a [[clandestine cell system]] of [[professional revolutionaries]] conspiring to overthrow the British state.&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt; The NRF stressed this was a "highly militant strategy" and advised that some members may only fund the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Quote taken from the [[#CITEREFnrf website strategy|NRF website]]. See {{Harvnb|Macklin|2005}} for a discussion of the NRF's membership structure.&lt;/ref&gt; Southgate claims that the NRF took part in anti-[[vivisection]] protests in August 2000 alongside [[Hunt sabotage|hunt saboteurs]] and the [[Animal Liberation Front]] by following a strategy of [[entryism]],&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its only known public action under the "national-anarchist" name was to hold an anarchist heretics fair in October 2000, in which a number of fringe groups participated. However, after a coalition of green anarchists and [[anti-fascism|anti-fascists]] blocked three further events from being held in 2001, Southgate and the NRF abandoned this strategy and retreated to purely disseminating their ideas in [[Internet forum]]s.&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 2003" /&gt; The NRF had long been aware of the bridging power of the Internet, which provided it with a reach and influence hitherto not available to the groupuscular right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whine|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It thus became part of the Euro-American radical right, a virtual community of European and American right-wing extremists seeking to establish a new [[pan-nationalism|pan-national]] and [[ethnoreligious group|ethnoreligious]] identity for all people they believe belong to the "[[Aryan race]]".&lt;ref name="BlackSun" /&gt; Southgate disbanded the NRF in 2003.

Shortly after Southgate and other NRF associates became involved with ''Synthesis'', the online journal of a forum called the ''Cercle de la Rose Noire'', which seeks a fusion of anarchism, [[occultism]] and [[metapolitics]] with the contemporary concerns of the ecological and [[global justice movement]]s. Thus, through the medium of musical subcultures ([[black metal]] and [[neofolk]] music scenes) and the creation of [[permanent autonomous zone]]s for [[neo-völkisch movements|neo-''völkisch'']] communes, they hope to disseminate their [[subversion|subversive]] ideas throughout society in order to achieve [[cultural hegemony]].&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt;

The national-anarchist idea has spread around the world over the Internet, assisted by groups such as the [[Thule-Seminar]] which set up web sites in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, only a few web sites have been established but there has been a trend towards a steady increase.&lt;ref name="Sunshine 2008" /&gt; National-anarchism in the U.S. began as a relatively obscure movement, made up of probably fewer than 200 individuals, led by Andrew Yeoman of the Bay Area National Anarchists (BANA), based in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and a couple of other groups in Northern California and Idaho. Organizations based on national-anarchist ideology have gained a foothold in Russia and have been accused of sowing turmoil in the [[environmental movement]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="Sanchez 2009" /&gt; There are adherents in England, Spain and Australia, among other nations.&lt;ref name="Sanchez 2009" /&gt;

On 8 September 2007 in Sydney, Australia, the [[anti-globalization movement]] mobilized against [[neoliberalism|neoliberal economic policies]] by opposing the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] summit. During the street protests, national-anarchists infiltrated the left-anarchist [[black bloc]] but the police had to protect them from being expelled by irate activists.&lt;ref name="Sanchez 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFMercerChesterton2007|''The Sunday Telegraph'', September 9, 2007]]."[Some protest groups] seemed thankful for the strong police presence. Twenty members of an anarchist movement, all wearing black hoodies with their faces covered by bandanas, were escorted away by police after marching only 20m. The group, New Right Australia and New Zealand, became a focal point for the crowd, who turned on them, accusing them of being Nazis."&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, national-anarchists have joined other marches in Australia and in the U.S.; in April 2008, they protested on behalf of the [[Tibetan independence movement]] against the Chinese government during the [[2008 Summer Olympics torch relay#International leg|Olympic torch relay in both Canberra, Australia, and San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="Sunshine 2008" /&gt; National-anarchists in the U.S. are carefully studying the successes and failures of their more prominent international counterparts as they attempt to similarly win converts from the [[radical environmentalism|radical environmentalist]] and [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] movements in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Sanchez 2009" /&gt;

On [[May Day]] 2010, BANA participated in the Golden Gate [[Minuteman Project|Minutemen]]'s march in front of San Francisco City Hall in support of [[Arizona SB 1070|Arizona's anti-illegal immigration senate bill]]. The march took place during [[International Workers' Day]] demonstrations as an attempt to counter mass protest against the bill, in [[Mission District, San Francisco|San Francisco's Mission District]]. Local news media reported that Yeoman and four other national-anarchists were physically assaulted by about 10 protesters as they left the march.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFSmiley2010|''SF Weekly'', May 1, 2010]]; [[#CITEREFGulezianHollyfied2010|KGO-TV report, May 1, 2010]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
The [[Conservative Revolutionary movement|conservative revolutionary]] concept of the [[Anarch (sovereign individual)|anarch]], as articulated by [[Ernst Jünger|Jünger]], is central to national-anarchism.&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt; National-anarchists see [[modernity]], [[liberalism]], [[materialism]], [[consumerism]], [[immigration]], [[multiracialism]], [[multiculturalism]], and [[globalization]] as the primary causes of the social decline of [[nation]]s and [[cultural identity]].&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt; They stress a strategic and ideological alliance of [[separatism#Racial|racial separatists]] in the [[Western world]], [[Eurasianists#Eurasianism today|neo-Eurasianists]] in Russia, [[islamism|Islamists]] in [[Muslim world|Muslim-majority countries]], [[list of active autonomist and secessionist movements|autonomist and secessionist movements]] in the [[least developed country|least developed countries]], and [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionists]] everywhere to resist the "[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]"—globalization viewed as an instrument of [[List of conspiracy theories#Jewish conspiracy theories|Jewish-dominated international banking]] and [[American imperialism]]—that is inevitably leading to global [[economic collapse]] and [[ecological collapse]].&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sunshine 2008" /&gt;

National-anarchism echoes most [[anarchist schools of thought|strains of anarchism]] by expressing a desire to reorganize human relationships, with an emphasis on replacing the hierarchical structures of the state and capitalism with [[localism (politics)|local]], community [[Anarchist law#Decision-making|decision-making]]. National-anarchists, however, aim towards a [[decentralization|decentralized]] social order where each [[neotribalism|new tribe]] builds and maintains a [[permanent autonomous zone]] for a [[self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]] [[commune]], which is politically [[Direct democracy|directly democratic]], economically [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualistic]], socially and culturally [[traditional values|traditional]], and ecologically [[sustainability|sustainable]].&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt;

Asserting the [[right to difference]], national-anarchists publicly advocate a model of society in which communities that wish to can practice racial, ethnic, religious or sexual [[separatism]] are able to peacefully coexist alongside mixed or integrated communities without requiring force.&lt;ref name=ARV&gt;{{Harvnb|Preston|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They claim that "[[permanent autonomous zone|national autonomous zones]]" (NAZs) could exist with their own rules for permanent residence without the strict ethnic divisions and violence advocated by other forms of "[[blood and soil]]" [[ethnic nationalism]].&lt;ref name=ARV /&gt;

Many national-anarchists are influenced by the [[perennial philosophy]] of [[Julius Evola|Evola]] and the radical [[traditionalist school]], which calls for a "[[Revolt Against the Modern World|revolt against the modern world]]".&lt;ref name="Sanchez 2009" /&gt; They therefore have a pessimistic vision of modern [[Western culture]] yet optimistically believe that the "[[The Decline of the West|decline of the West]]" will pave the way for its materialism to be expunged and replaced by the [[idealism]] of [[The Primordial Tradition|primordial tradition]].&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt; Many national-anarchists reject [[Christianity]] because they believe it is a [[Abrahamic religions|Semitic religion]] that usurped the [[Aryan race|Aryan]] legacy of [[Mithraic mysteries]] as the historically dominant religion and moral system of the West.&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt; Some embrace a [[anarchism and religion#Religious anarchism and anarchist themes in religions|spiritual anarchism]] based on different forms of [[neopaganism]], [[occultism]] and [[ethnic religion|ethnic mysticism]], especially [[neo-völkisch movements#Nordic racial paganism|Nordic racial paganism]], which they view as genuine expressions of Western spirituality, culture and identity that can also serve as an antidote to the [[social alienation|socially alienating]] effects of [[consumer culture]]. Other national-anarchists hold [[racial segregation]] and [[revitalization movement|cultural revitalization]] through the establishment of [[confederation]]s of autonomous tribal [[commune]]s ("[[Volk (German word)|''volk'']] autonomy") as the ultimate barrier against globalized racial and [[cultural homogenization]].&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt;

According to American [[panarchism|panarchist]] Keith Preston, national-anarchism and classical American ideals of [[Jeffersonian democracy]] are reconcilable, despite the [[anti-Americanism]] of European national-anarchists and the patriotism of American [[paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]], because of their common values: [[regionalism (politics)|regionalism]], [[localism (politics)|localism]], [[agrarianism]], and [[traditional values|traditionalism]].&lt;ref name=ARV /&gt;

==Position on political spectrum==
While the combination of post-left anarchist opposition to [[statism]] and [[capitalism]], with [[ethnopluralism|right-wing support for ethnic and racial separatism]], makes its classification on the left-right political spectrum problematic, the following scholars who have examined national-anarchism consider it to be on the radical right.&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 2003"&gt;{{Harvnb|Griffin|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sykes 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sunshine 2008" /&gt;

In 2003, [[Roger Griffin]] argued that national-anarchism is a segment of the groupuscular right which has evolved towards a "mazeway resynthesis" between "classic fascism, third positionism, neo-anarchism and new types of anti-systemic politics born of the anti-globalization movement", whose main ideological innovation is a [[stateless society|stateless]] [[palingenetic ultranationalism]].&lt;ref name="Griffin 2003" /&gt;

In 2005, Graham D. Macklin, in his essay ''Co-opting the counter culture: Troy Southgate and the National Revolutionary Faction'', building off of the writings of Griffin,     
argued that the [[conservative revolutionary]] concept of the [[Anarch (sovereign individual)|anarch]] provides sanction for the ideological shapeshifting and unrestrained [[eclecticism]] of national-anarchism, allowing its adherents to assert they have transcended the dichotomy of conventional politics to embrace higher political forms that are "beyond left and right".&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt; Macklin further argued that despite a protean capacity for change, [[far right|far-right]] groupuscules retain some principes which he calls core fascist values (namely [[palingenesis]], [[ultranationalism]], [[anti-liberal]] and [[Criticisms of Marxism|anti-Marxist]] third positionism, and violent [[direct action]]). Macklin therefore concludes that national-anarchism is a synthesis of anarchism and fascism (or, more precisely, the [[Julius Evola#Politics|radical traditionalism]] of [[Julius Evola|Evola]]), which represents a "[[Revolt Against the Modern World|revolt against the modern world]]".&lt;ref name="Macklin 2005" /&gt;

In 2005, Alan Sykes, in his book ''The Radical Right in Britain: Social Imperialism to the BNP'', argued that national-anarchism represents a further evolution in the thinking of the radical right rather than an entirely new dimension, a response to the new situation of the late 20th century in which the apparent triumph of [[materialism|materialist]] capitalism on a global scale requires a greater assertion of the centrality of [[idealism|anti-materialist]] nationalism.&lt;ref name="Sykes 2005" /&gt;

==Criticism==
National-anarchism has critics on both the [[left–right politics|left and right of the political spectrum]]. Both left- and right-wing critics look upon their politics with skepticism, if not outright hostility, in part because they find it difficult to consolidate national-anarchism into the traditional right-left spectrum.

Left-wing critics assert that national-anarchism is a "Trojan horse for white nationalism" and represents what many [[anti-fascism|anti-fascists]] see as the potential new face of [[fascism]]. They argue that it is a form of [[crypto-fascism]] which hopes to avoid the stigma of classic fascism by [[cultural appropriation|appropriating]] symbols, slogans, and stances of the [[left anarchism|left-wing anarchist]] movement, while engaging in [[entryism]] to inject some core [[Fascism#Tenets|fascist values]] into the [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]] and [[environmental movement|environmental]] movements. They further argue that national-anarchists hope to draw members away from traditional white nationalist groups to their own synthesis of ideas, which they claim are "neither left nor right". These critics warn that the danger national-anarchists represent is not in their marginal political strength, but in their potential to show an innovative way that [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups can rebrand themselves and reset their project on a new footing. Even if the results are modest, this can disrupt left-wing social movements and their focus on [[egalitarianism]] and [[social justice]]; and instead spread [[separatism|separatist]] ideas based on [[naturalistic fallacy]], [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], [[heterosexism]], and [[antifeminism]] amongst grassroots activists.&lt;ref name="Sunshine 2008" /&gt;

Some far-right critics argue that [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] joining the National-Anarchist Movement will lead to them losing credit for the successes of their "[[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]]" struggle if it is co-opted by [[left anarchism|left-wing anarchists]]. They further argue that national-anarchists want the [[Radical chic#Terrorist chic|militant chic]] of calling themselves "anarchists" without the historical and philosophical baggage that accompanies such a claim, such as the link with 19th-century [[Jewish anarchism|Jewish anarchists]].&lt;ref name="Sanchez 2009" /&gt;

{{Politics of India}}

Constitution of India doesn't define the word 'Minority' but has used the word minorities considering two attributes religion or language of a person. For minorities Constitution of India has envisaged a number of rights and safeguards. To provide enough equality and to dwindle the discrimination, makers have spelt out various things in Fundamental Rights (PartIII); Directive Principles of State policy (Part IV) and also the Fundamental Duties (Part IV-A). However, with rising right and rising wedge between right and left and also the ephemeral political aspirations of various political parties have diluted the discrimination safeguards.

The Union Government set up the '''National Commission for Minorities''' (NCM) under the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992. Six religious communities, viz; Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Zoroastrians (Parsis) and Jains have been notified in Gazette of India  as minority communities by the Union Government all over India .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minorities.in/profiles.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025054311/http://www.minorities.in/profiles.php |archivedate=25 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Original notification of 1993 was for Five religious communities Sikhs, Buddhists,Parsis,Christians and Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/1993/E-0462-1993-0633-18514.pdf|title=Extra ordinary Gazette Notification|last=|first=|date=23 October 1993|website=Egazzette|publisher=GOI|access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights &amp; Safeguards of Minorities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncm.nic.in/Constitutional_provisions.html|title=Constitutional Provisions|last=|first=|date=|website=National Commission for Minorities|publisher=GOI|access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
Although Indian Constitution does not define word Minority but it has provided constitutional safeguards and fundamental rights to minorities:

=== Under Fundamental Rights Part III of Indian Constitution ===
Indian state is committed to administer these rights which can be enforced by judiciary
# Right of ‘any section of the citizens’ to ‘conserve’ its ‘distinct language, script or culture’; [Article 29(1)]
# Right of all Religious and Linguistic Minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice;[Article 30(1)]
# Freedom of Minority-managed educational institutions from discrimination in the matter of receiving aid from the State;[Article30(2)]

=== Under Part XVII Official Language of Indian Constitution ===
# Rights for any section of population for language spoken by them ;[Article 347]
# Provision for facilities of instruction in mother tongue ; [Article 350A]
# Provisioning a special officer for linguistic minorities and defining his duties ; [ Article 350B]

== Sachar Committee Report ==
On March 9, 2005 the then Prime Minister issued a Notification for the constitution of a High Level
Committee to prepare a report on the social, economic and educational status of the Muslim community of India.
Recommendations contained in the Report of the High Level Committee on Social, Economic and Educational Status of the Muslim Community of India headed by Justice Rajindar Sachar (Retd.):
# Need for Transparency, Monitoring and Data Availability - Create a National Data Bank (NDB) where all relevant data for various socio-religious categories are maintained.
# Enhancing the Legal Basis for Providing Equal Opportunities Set up an Equal Opportunity Commission to look into grievances of deprived groups like minorities.
# Shared Spaces: Need to Enhance Diversity: The idea of providing certain incentives to a 'diversity index' should be explored.
# Education: a process of evaluating the content of the school text books needs to be initiated to purge them of explicit and implicit content that may impart inappropriate social values, especially religious intolerance. Need to ensure that all children in the age group 0-14 have access to free and high quality education.
# High quality Government schools should be set up in all areas of Muslim concentration. Exclusive schools for girls should be set up, particularly for the 9-12 standards. This would facilitate higher participation of Muslim girls in school education. In co-education schools more women teachers need to be appointed.
# Provide primary education in Urdu in areas where Urdu speaking population is concentrated.
# Mechanisms to link madarsas with higher secondary school board.
# Recognise degrees from madarsas for eligibility in Defence Services, Civil Services and Banking examinations.	
# Increase employment share of Muslims, particularly where there is great deal of public dealing. 
# Enhancing Participation in Governance: appropriate state level laws can be enacted to ensure minority representation in local bodies
# Create a nomination procedure to increase participation of minorities in public bodies.
# Establish a delimitation procedure that does not reserve constituencies with high minority population for SCs.
# Enhancing Access to Credit and Government Programmes: Provide financial and other support to initiatives built around occupations where Muslims are concentrated and that have growth potential.
# Improve participation and share of minorities, particularly Muslims, in business of regular commercial banks 
# Improving Employment Opportunities and Conditions
The Committee suggested that policies should “sharply focus on inclusive development and ‘mainstreaming’ of the Community while respecting diversity.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.minorityaffairs.gov.in/sites/upload_files/moma/files/Sachar%20Committee%20Recommendations-English.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-ministerial government departments''' ('''NMGDs''') are a type of [[British government department]] that deal with matters for which direct political oversight has been judged unnecessary or inappropriate. They are headed by [[British Civil Service|senior civil servants]]. Some fulfil a [[Regulatory agency|regulatory or inspection function]], and their status is therefore intended to protect them from political interference.  Some are headed by a permanent office holder, such as a [[Permanent Secretary]] or [[Second Permanent Secretary]].&lt;ref name="Government Departments and Agencies"&gt;[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/UKgovernment/Centralgovernmentandthemonarchy/DG_073446 Government Departments and Agencies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010015215/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/UKgovernment/Centralgovernmentandthemonarchy/DG_073446 |date=10 October 2012 }}, Government, Citizens and Rights, DirectGov.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The status of an NMGD varies considerably from one to another. For example:&lt;ref name="How to be a Civil Servant"&gt;[http://www.policy.manchester.ac.uk/resources/civil-servant/ How to be a Civil Servant], What is a Civil Servant?&lt;/ref&gt;
* Senior officials in [[HM Revenue and Customs]] work closely with cabinet ministers. Its key policies are set each year in the Finance Act. However, neither ministers nor parliament can interfere in day-to-day taxation decisions.
* A number of NMGDs are highly independent bodies; for example the [[Charity Commission]], [[Ofsted]] and economic regulators such as the [[Competition and Markets Authority]] or the [[Postal Services Commission]]. These bodies are "creatures of statute": &amp;ndash; that is they implement legislation which they have no power to change. Their political independence is assured by providing that they have the status of government departments, but are accountable only to parliament and the courts. Their budgets are usually set by the Treasury, not by the department which set them up, and they are often funded by licence fees paid by the industries which they regulate.
* The [[Food Standards Agency]] is an NMGD which was created by merging two large parts of the Departments of Health and what was then the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The aim was to reassure the public (after the [[mad-cow disease|BSE]]/[[vCJD]] crisis) that decisions about food safety would in future be taken by an independent body free of political control. Because the FSA was designed to take politics out of food safety, it does not seek ministerial approval for its actions, even when negotiating and agreeing to [[European legislation]] on behalf of the UK.

==List of non-ministerial departments==
A list of NMGDs is maintained by the [[Cabinet Office]], which currently states that the following 20 are in existence:&lt;ref name="Non-ministerial Departments"&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations#non-ministerial-departments Non-ministerial Departments], Retrieved 16 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Man pilos Louvre MNE1330.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[Red figure pottery|red-figure]] plate from [[Apulia]], third quarter of the 4th century BC, [[Louvre]] ]]

The '''pileus''' ({{Lang-gr|πῖλος}} – ''pilos'', also '''pilleus''' or '''pilleum''' in [[Latin]]) was a brimless, [[felt]] cap worn in [[Ancient Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/460407/pileus Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; and surrounding regions, later also introduced in [[Ancient Rome]]. The Greek {{lang|grc|πιλίδιον}} (''pilidion'') and Latin ''pilleolus'' were smaller versions, similar to a skullcap.

==History==
[[File:Peasant basket Louvre Myr330.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Ancient Greek]] terracotta statuette of a peasant wearing a pilos, 1st century BC]]

===Greece===
The '''''pilos''''' (Greek: πῖλος, ''felt''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpi%3Dlos2 πῖλος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) was a common conical travelling hat in [[Illyria]] and [[Ancient Greece]]. The pilos is the brimless version of the ''[[petasos]]''. It could be made of felt or leather. Pilos caps often identify the mythical twins, or [[Castor and Pollux|Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux]], as represented in sculptures, bas-reliefs and on ancient ceramics. Their caps were supposedly the remnants of the egg from which they hatched.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tzetzes]], ''On Lycophron'', noted by [[Karl Kerenyi]]'s ''The Heroes of the Greeks'', 1959:107 note 584.&lt;/ref&gt; The pilos appears on [[Votive object|votive figurines]] of boys at the sanctuary of the [[Cabeiri]] at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], the ''Cabeirion''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]]. ''Greek Religion'', 1985:281.&lt;/ref&gt;

In warfare, the pilos type helmet was often worn by the [[peltast]] light infantry, in conjunction with the [[exomis]], but it was also worn by the heavy infantry.{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}}

The '''pilos helmet''' was made of bronze in the same shape as the pilos which was presumably sometimes worn under the helmet for comfort, giving rise to the helmet's conical shape.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Sekunda,''The Spartan Army'', p.30&lt;/ref&gt; The first widespread adoption of the pilos helmet occurred in Sparta towards the end of the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Obert, ''A Brief History of Greek Helmets'', p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome===
[[File:Eid Mar.jpg|thumb|left|Pileus between two daggers, on the [[obverse|reverse]] of a [[denarius]] issued by [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] to commemorate the [[assassination of Julius Caesar]] on the [[Ides of March]]]]
In Ancient Rome, a slave was freed in a ceremony in which a [[praetor]] touched the slave with a rod called a ''vindicta'' and pronounced him to be free. The slave's head was shaved and a pileus was placed upon it. Both the ''vindicta'' and the cap were considered symbols of [[Libertas]], the goddess representing liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cobb|first=T.R.R.|authorlink=Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb|page=285, 285n2|title=An inquiry into the law of Negro slavery in the United States of America|place=Philadelphia|year=1858|publisher=T. &amp; J.W. Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a form of extra-legal manumission (the ''manumissio minus justa'') considered less legally sound than manumission in a court of law.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

One 19th century dictionary of classical antiquity states that, "Among the Romans the cap of felt was the emblem of liberty. When a slave obtained his freedom he had his head shaved, and wore instead of his hair an undyed pileus."&lt;ref&gt;πίλεον λευκόν, [[Diodorus Siculus]] Exc. Leg. 22 p. 625, ed. Wess.; [[Plautus|Plaut.]] Amphit. I.1.306; [[Persius]], V.82&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the phrase ''servos ad pileum vocare'' is a summons to liberty, by which slaves were frequently called upon to take up arms with a promise of liberty ([[Livy|Liv.]] XXIV.32). The figure of Liberty on some of the coins of [[Antoninus Pius]], struck A.D. 145, holds this cap in the right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, James. Entry "Pileus" in William Smith's ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' ([[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]], London, 1875).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
Jewish priests wore a ''pilos'' (conical cap), mentioned in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Exodus|28:40|HE}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Costume |volume=7 |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''politiquera''' in the United States is an individual who is paid for by an [[election]] [[Political campaign|campaign]] to knock on doors to issue [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flier]]s and encourage people to get out and vote in favour of the candidate. Candidates who generally lack the grass root [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s who normally do this job, resort to politiqueras to achieve the goal. Use of politiqueras in southern regions of Texas during the [[democratic primary]] on March 4, 2008 by [[Hillary Clinton]] campaign is one such example.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/13/us/politics/13streetcash.html?_r=1&amp;ref=politics&amp;oref=slogin Politiqueras in Hillary Clinton campaign in texas]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''post-war consensus''' is a historian's model of political co-operation  in [[Political history of the United Kingdom (1945–present)|post-war British political history]], from the end of [[World War II]] in 1945 to the late-1970s, and its repudiation by Conservative Party leader [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Majorities in both parties agreed upon it. The consensus tolerated or encouraged [[nationalisation]], strong [[trade union]]s, heavy regulation, high taxes, and a generous [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, David (1997). ''British Politics Since 1945: The Rise, Fall and Rebirth of Consensus'' (2nd ed. Blackwell). &lt;/ref&gt;

The concept states that there was a widespread consensus that covered support for coherent package of policies that were developed in the 1930s and promised during the Second World War, focused on a [[mixed economy]], [[Keynesianism]], and a broad welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;Kavanagh, Dennis (1992). "The Postwar Consensus," ''Twentieth Century British History''. 3#2  pp. 175–90.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the timing of the interpretation has been debated by historians, asking whether it had weakened and collapsed before Thatcherism arrived in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toye, Richard]] (2013). "From 'Consensus' to 'Common Ground': The Rhetoric of the Postwar Settlement and its Collapse," ''Journal of Contemporary History''. 48#1 pp. 3–23.&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been debate as to whether a "postwar consensus" ever really existed.&lt;ref&gt; Ritschel, Daniel (2003). "Consensus in the Postwar Period After 1945," in David Loades, ed., ''Reader's Guide to British History''. 1:296–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The model==
The historian's model of the post-war consensus was most fully developed by [[Paul Addison]].&lt;ref&gt; Paul Addison, ''The road to 1945: British politics and the Second World War'' (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; The basic argument is that in the 1930s Liberal intellectuals led by [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[William Beveridge]] developed a series of plans that became especially attractive as the wartime government promised a much better post-war Britain and saw the need to engage every sector of society. The coalition government during the war, headed by [[Churchill]] and [[Attlee]], signed off on a series of white papers that promised Britain a much improved welfare state after the war. The promises included the national health service, and expansion of education, housing, and a number of welfare programmes. It included the nationalisation of weak industries. 

In education, the major legislation was the [[Education Act 1944|Education Act of 1944]], written by Conservative [[Rab Butler]], a moderate, with his deputy, Labour's [[James Chuter Ede]], a former teacher who would become [[Home Secretary]] throughout the Attlee administration.  It expanded and modernised the educational system and became part of the consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Jeffereys, "R. A. Butler, the Board of Education and the 1944 Education Act," ''History'' (1984) 69#227 pp. 415–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Simon, "The 1944 Education Act: A Conservative Measure?," ''History of Education'' (1986) 15#1 pp. 31–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party did not challenge the system of elite public schools – they became part of the consensus. It also called for building many new universities to dramatically broaden educational base of society. Conservatives did not challenge the socialised medicine of the National Health Service; indeed, they boasted they could do a better job of running it.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Klein, "Why Britain's conservatives support a socialist health care system." Health Affairs 4#1 (1985): 41–58. [http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/4/1/41.full.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In foreign policy, the consensus called for an anti-Communist [[Cold War]] policy, decolonisation, close ties to NATO and to the United States and the Commonwealth, and slowly emerging ties to the European Community.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Gordon, ''Conflict and consensus in Labour's foreign policy, 1914–1965'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;{{page?|date=May 2017}} 

The model states that from 1945 until the arrival of Margaret Thatcher in 1979, there was a broad multi-partisan national consensus on social and economic policy, especially regarding the welfare state, nationalised health services, educational reform, a mixed economy, government regulation, Keynesian macroeconomics, policies, and full employment. Apart from the question of nationalisation of some industries, these policies were broadly accepted by the three major parties, as well as by industry, the financial community and the labour movement. Until the 1980s, historians generally agreed on the existence and  importance of the consensus. Some historians such as Ralph Miliband expressed disappointment that the consensus was a modest or even conservative package that blocked a fully socialised society. &lt;ref&gt;Ralph Miliband, Parliamentary socialism: A study in the politics of labour. (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[Angus Calder]] complained bitterly that the post-war reforms were an inadequate reward for the wartime sacrifices, and a cynical betrayal of the people's hope for a more just post-war society.&lt;ref&gt; Angus Campbell, The Peoples War: Britain, 1939–1945'' (1969). &lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there has been a historiographical  debate on whether such a consensus ever existed.

==Policies inside the consensus==
The foundations of the post-war consensus can be traced to the reports of [[William Beveridge]], a Liberal economist who in 1942 formulated the concept of a more comprehensive [[welfare state]] in Great Britain.&lt;ref name="Morgan_6_a_8"&gt;Kenneth O. Morgan, ''Britain Since 1945: The People's Peace'' (2001), pp. 4, 6&lt;/ref&gt; The first general election since 1935 was held in Britain in May 1945, giving a landslide victory for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], whose leader was [[Clement Attlee]].  The policies undertaken and implemented by this Labour government laid the base of the consensus. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] accepted many of these changes and promised not to reverse them in its 1947 ''[[Industrial Charter]]''.

The post-war consensus included a belief in [[Keynesian economics]],&lt;ref name="Morgan_6_a_8"/&gt; a [[mixed economy]] with the [[nationalisation]] of major industries, the establishment of the [[National Health Service]] and the creation of the modern welfare state in Britain. The policies were instituted by all governments (both Labour and Conservative) in the post-war period. The consensus has been held to characterise British politics until the economic crises of the 1970s which led to the end of the [[post-war economic boom]] and the rise of [[monetarism|monetarist]] economics.

===Labour revisionism===
''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' by [[Anthony Crosland]], published in 1956, was one of the most influential books in post-war British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Jeffreys|title=Tony Crosland, The Future of Socialism and New Labour |url=http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=31527&amp;amid=30229338|work=History Review|pages=37–38|date=March 2006|}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the seminal work of the 'revisionist' school of Labour politics.&lt;ref&gt;Crosland sought to revise the Labour Party's constitutional commitment to the nationalisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange, (Aims, Clause four, party four): "If Socialism is defined as the nationalisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange, we produce solutions which deny almost all the values that socialists have normally read into the word.” Quoted by Hattersley in [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article639445.ece Hattersley, Roy, ''To imagine Labour's future, rewind 50 years''], The Times online, September 15, 2006, accessed 27 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
A central argument in the book is Crosland's distinction between 'means' and 'ends'. Crosland demonstrates the variety of socialist thought over time, and argues that a definition of socialism founded on nationalisation and public ownership is mistaken, since these are simply one possible means to an end. For Crosland, the defining goal of the left should be more social equality. Crosland argued that

{{cquote|In Britain, equality of opportunity and social mobility... are not enough. They need to be combined with measures... to equalise the distribution of rewards and privileges so as to diminish the degree of class stratification, the injustices of large inequalities and the collective discontents.}}

Crosland also argued that an attack on unjustified inequalities would give any left party a political project to make the definition of the end point of 'how much equality' a secondary and more academic question.

Crosland also developed his argument about the nature of capitalism (developing the argument in his contribution 'The Transition from Capitalism' in the 1952 ''New Fabian Essays'' volume). Asking, "is this still capitalism?", Crosland argued that post-war capitalism had fundamentally changed, meaning that the Marxist claim that it was not possible to pursue equality in a capitalist economy was no longer true. Crosland wrote that,

{{cquote|The most characteristic features of capitalism have disappeared – the absolute rule of private property, the subjection of all life to market influences, the domination of the [[profit motive]], the neutrality of government, typical laissez-faire division of income and the ideology of individual rights.}}

Crosland argued that these features of a reformed managerial capitalism were irreversible. Others within the Labour Party argued that [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] brought about its reversal.

A third important argument was Crosland's liberal vision of the 'good society'. Here his target was the dominance in Labour and Fabian thinking of [[Sidney Webb]] and [[Beatrice Webb]], and a rather grey, top down bureaucratic vision of the socialist project. Following Tawney, Crosland stressed that equality would not mean uniformity:

{{cquote|We need not only higher exports and old-age pensions, but more open-air cafes, brighter and gayer streets at night, later closing hours for public houses, more local repertory theatres, better and more hospitable hoteliers and restaurateurs, brighter and cleaner eating houses, more riverside cafes, more pleasure gardens on the Battersea model, more murals and pictures in public places, better designs for furniture and pottery and women’s clothes, statues in the centre of new housing estates, better-designed new street lamps and telephone kiosks and so on ad infinitum.}}

===Butskellism===
"Butskellism" was a somewhat satirical term sometimes used in British politics to refer to this consensus, established in the 1950s and associated with the exercise of office as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] by [[Rab Butler]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and [[Hugh Gaitskell]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The term was inspired by a leading article in ''[[The Economist]]'' by Norman Macrae which dramatised the claimed convergence by referring to a fictitious "Mr. Butskell".&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'', February 1954&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Economist. "[http://www.economist.com/node/16374404 The unacknowledged giant]", 27 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate about consensus==
However, the concept of consensus has also been challenged as a myth.  Labour Historian [[Ben Pimlott]] says this idea is a "mirage, an illusion which rapidly fades the closer one gets to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Kerr|title=Postwar British Politics: From Conflict to Consensus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2sudiOrLHYC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pimlott sees much disputation and little harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Pimlott, "Is The 'Postwar Consensus' A Myth?"  ''Contemporary Record'' (1989) 2#6  pp. 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes the term "Butskellism" meant harmony of economic policy between the parties, but it was in practice a term of abuse, not celebration.&lt;ref&gt; David Dutton, ''British Politics Since 1945: The Rise, Fall and Rebirth of Consensus'' (2nd ed. Blackwell, 1997) pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, Scott Kelly claimed that there was in fact a sustained argument over the use of physical controls, [[monetary policy]] and [[direct taxation]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientists Dennis Kavanagh and Peter Morris defend the concept, arguing that clear, major continuities existed regarding policies toward the economy, full employment, trade unions, and welfare programs. There was agreement as well on the major issues of foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Kavanagh and Peter Morris, "Is the 'Postwar Consensus' A Myth?" ''Contemporary Record'' (1989) 2#6 pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; British historian [[David Kynaston]] considers the period of post-war consensus a unique and distinct period in the history of twentieth century Britain and has undertaken to map the development of British society between 1945–79 in his ongoing series of books titled ''Tales of a New Jerusalem''. So far, three volumes have been published, covering the years 1945–63.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/series/73707-tales-of-a-new-jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collapse of consensus==
Market-orientated conservatives gathered strength in the 1970s in the face of economic paralysis. They rediscovered [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s the ''Road to Serfdom'' (1944) and brought in [[Milton Friedman]], the leader of the [[Chicago school of economics]]. He preached [[Monetarism]] to discredit Keynesianism. [[Keith Joseph]] played a major  role as an advisor to Thatcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen J. Lee|title=Aspects of British Political History: 1914–1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhMI9U3GIm8C&amp;pg=PA224|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynesianism itself seemed no longer to be the magic bullet for economic crises of the 1970s. Mark Kesselman et al. argue:
:Britain was suffering economically without growth and with growing political discontent....the "[[Winter of Discontent|winter of discontent]]" destroyed Britain's collectivist consensus and discredited the Keynesian welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Kesselman et al.|title=Introduction to Comparative Politics, Brief Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZg3C2l7unoC&amp;pg=PA59|year=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global events such as the [[1973 oil crisis]] put pressure on the post-war consensus; this pressure was intensified by domestic problems such as high inflation, the [[three-day week]] and industrial unrest (particularly in the declining coal-mining industry).  In early 1976, expectations that inflation and the [[Twin deficit hypothesis|double deficit]] would get worse precipitated a [[Pound sterling|Sterling]] crisis. By October, the pound had fallen by almost 25% against the dollar. At this point the [[Bank of England]] had exhausted its [[foreign reserves]] trying to prop up the currency, and as a result the [[James Callaghan|Callaghan]] government felt forced to ask the [[International Monetary Fund]] for a £2.3 billion loan, then the largest that the IMF had ever made. In  return the IMF demanded massive spending cuts and a tightening of the [[money supply]]. That  marked a suspension of [[Keynesian economics]] in Britain.  Callaghan reinforced this message in his speech to the [[Labour Party Conference]] at the height of the crisis, saying:
:We used to think that you could spend your way out of a recession and increase employment by cutting taxes and boosting government spending. I tell you in all candour that that option no longer exists, and in so far as it ever did exist, it only worked on each occasion since the war by injecting a bigger dose of inflation into the economy, followed by a higher level of unemployment as the next step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=B. Brivati|author2=R. Heffernan|title=The Labour Party: A Centenary History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ic5eCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95|year=2000|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thatcher reversed other elements of the post-war consensus, as when her [[Housing Act 1980]] allowed the residents to buy their flats. Thatcher did keep key elements of the post-war consensus, such as nationalised health care.  She promised Britons in 1982, the National Health Service is "safe in our hands."&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Klein,  "Why Britain's conservatives support a socialist health care system." ''Health Affairs'' 4#1 (1985): 41–58. [http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/4/1/41.full.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists Stephen Broadberry and Nicholas Crafts have argued that anticompetitive practices, enshrined in the post-war consensus, appear to have hindered the efficient working of the economy and, by implication, the reallocation of resources to their most profitable uses.&lt;ref&gt;Broadberry (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; David Higgins says the statistical data support Broadberry and Crafts.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Higgins, "British Manufacturing Financial Performance, 1950–79: Implications for the Productivity Debate and the Post-War Consensus," ''Business History'' (2003) 45#3 pp. 52–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The consensus was increasingly seen by those on the right as being the cause of Britain's relative economic decline. Believers in [[New Right#United Kingdom|New Right]] political beliefs saw their ideology as the solution to Britain's economic dilemmas in the 1970s. When the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] won the 1979 general election in the wake of the 1978–79 [[Winter of discontent]], they implemented New Right ideas and brought the post-war consensus to an end. A similar Thatcherite consensus would exist during John Major's premiership, with Neil Kinnock, John Smith and Tony Blair mostly accepting the policies advocated by the Conservatives at this time-this would continue until the [[2008 Financial Crisis]] which convinced politicians to abandon New Right neo-liberal markets and deregulation in favour of Keynesian methodologies.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==New Zealand==
Outside Britain, the term "post-war consensus" is used for an era of New Zealand political history, from the first [[New Zealand Labour Party]] government of the 1930s until the election of a fundamentally changed Labour party in 1984, following years of mostly [[New Zealand National Party]] rule. As in the UK, it was built around a 'historic compromise' between the different classes in society: the rights, health and security of employment for all workers would be guaranteed, in return for co-operation between unions and employers. The key ideological tenets of governments of the period were [[Keynesian]] economic policy, heavy [[economic interventionism|interventionism]], [[economic regulation]] and a very powerful [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;Joel D. Aberbach  and Tom Christensen, "Radical reform in New Zealand: crisis, windows of opportunity, and rational actors." ''Public Administration'' 79#2 (2001): 403–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Truman and MacArthur.JPG|thumb|right|General of the Army MacArthur shakes hands with President Truman at the [[Wake Island Conference]].|alt=Truman in a dark suit and tie and light hat shakes hands with MacArthur, in uniform wearing a shirt but no tie and his rumpled peaked cap.]]
On 11 April 1951, [[U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] relieved [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] of his commands after MacArthur made public statements which contradicted the administration's policies. MacArthur was a popular hero of [[World War II]] who was then the commander of [[United Nations]] forces fighting in the [[Korean War]], and his relief remains a controversial topic in the field of [[civil–military relations]].

MacArthur led the Allied forces in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific]] during World War II, and after the war was in charge of the [[occupation of Japan]]. When [[North Korea]] invaded [[South Korea]] in June 1950, starting the Korean War, he was designated commander of the United Nations forces defending South Korea. He conceived and executed the [[Battle of Inchon|amphibious assault at Inchon]] on 15 September 1950, for which he was hailed as a military genius. However, when he followed up his victory with a full-scale invasion of North Korea on Truman's orders, China intervened in the war and inflicted a series of defeats, compelling him to withdraw from North Korea. By April 1951, the military situation had stabilized, but MacArthur's public statements became increasingly irritating to Truman, and he relieved MacArthur of his commands. The [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] and the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] held a joint inquiry into the military situation and the circumstances surrounding MacArthur's relief, and concluded that "the removal of General MacArthur was within the constitutional powers of the President but the circumstances were a shock to national pride."{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|p=365}}

An apolitical military was an American tradition, but one that was difficult to uphold in an era when American forces were employed overseas in large numbers. The principle of [[civilian control of the military]] was also ingrained, but the rising complexity of military technology led to the creation of a professional military. This made civilian control increasingly problematic when coupled with the constitutional division of powers between the President as commander-in-chief, and the Congress with its power to raise armies, maintain a navy, and wage wars. In relieving MacArthur for failing to "respect the authority of the President" by privately communicating with Congress, Truman upheld the President's role as pre-eminent.

== Background ==
=== Harry Truman ===
{{main article|Harry S. Truman}}
[[Harry S. Truman]] became [[President of the United States]] on the death of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1945, and won an unexpected victory in the [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential election]]. He was the only president who served after 1897 without a college degree.{{sfn|Hamby|1995|pp=17–18, 135}} Although not highly educated, Truman was well read.{{sfn|Murray|Sinnreich|Lacey|2011|p=230}} When his high school friends went off to the state university in 1901, he enrolled in a local business school, but only lasted a semester. He later took night courses at the Kansas City Law School, but dropped out.{{sfn|Hamby|1995|pp=17–18, 135}} Truman attempted to gain admission to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, but was rejected for his poor eyesight. He was proud of his military service in the artillery during [[World War I]], and held a reserve commission as a [[colonel]].{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|pp=17–19}}

Truman distrusted regular soldiers and selected two [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]], [[Harry H. Vaughan]] and [[Louis H. Renfrow]], as his military aides.{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|pp=17–19}} Truman once remarked that he did not understand how the US Army could "produce men such as [[Robert E. Lee]], [[John J. Pershing]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] and [[Omar Bradley|Bradley]] and at the same time produce [[George A. Custer|Custers]], [[George S. Patton, Jr.|Pattons]] and [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]]."{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=18}}

During the 1948 [[Revolt of the Admirals]], a number of naval officers publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over cuts to [[naval aviation]] and [[amphibious warfare]] capability, resulting in the relief of the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Louis Denfeld]], and his replacement by Admiral [[Forrest Sherman]].{{sfn|Lewis|1998|p=38}} In testimony before the [[House Armed Services Committee]] investigation into the affair in October 1949, the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], [[General (United States)|General]] Omar Bradley, doubted that there would ever be another large scale amphibious operation.{{sfn|Lewis|1998|pp=30–34}}

=== Douglas MacArthur ===
{{main article|Douglas MacArthur}}
In stature and seniority, [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] Douglas MacArthur was the Army's foremost general. The son of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.]], a recipient of the [[Medal of Honor]] for action during the [[American Civil War]],{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|pp=13–14}} he had graduated at the top of his West Point class of 1903,{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|p=27}} but never attended an advanced service school except for the engineer course in 1908.{{sfn|Frank|2007|p=5}} He had a distinguished combat record in [[World War I]], and had served as [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] from 1930 to 1935, working closely with Presidents [[Herbert Hoover]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]], despite occasional clashes over the military budget.{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|pp=89–103}} He would later compare Roosevelt's "extraordinary self-control"{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|p=101}} with Truman's "violent temper and paroxysms of ungovernable rage".{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|p=393}}

Apart from his World War I-era service in Mexico and Europe, his overseas postings had been in Asia and the Pacific. During [[World War II]], he had become a national hero and had been awarded the Medal of Honor for the unsuccessful defense of the Philippines in the [[Battle of Bataan]]. He had commanded the Allied armies in the [[New Guinea Campaign]] and [[Philippines Campaign (1944–45)|Philippines Campaign]], fulfilling his famous promise to return to the Philippines. In 1944 and 1948, he had been considered a possible [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for president. After the war, as the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] (SCAP), he had overseen the [[Occupation of Japan]] and played an important part in the post-war political and social transformation of that country.{{sfn|Lowe|1990|pp=625–626}}

By 1950, the occupation of Japan was winding down, but MacArthur remained in the country as Commander-in-Chief Far East (CINCFE), a post to which he had been appointed by Truman in 1945.{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=14}} MacArthur had to deal with deep cuts in the defense budget that saw his troop numbers decline from 300,000 in 1947 to 142,000 in 1948. Despite his protests, further reductions had followed and, by June 1950, there were only 108,000 troops in his Far East Command.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=52–53}} Cuts in funds and personnel produced shortages of serviceable equipment. Of the Far East Command's 18,000 [[jeep]]s, 10,000 were unserviceable; of its 113,870 2½-ton [[6x6]] trucks, only 4,441 were serviceable. On the positive side, the Far East Command initiated a program of reclaiming and refurbishing war materiel from abandoned stocks throughout the Pacific. This had not only recovered a great deal of valuable stores and equipment, it had also generated a useful repair and rebuilding industry in Japan. Meanwhile, the shift away from occupation duties had permitted a greater focus on training for combat.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=58–60}}

== Events leading up to the relief ==

=== Korean War ===

{{further|Korean War}}
[[North Korea]] invaded [[South Korea]] on 25 June 1950, starting the [[Korean War]]. In response to an urgent request from the [[Korean Military Advisory Group]] for more ammunition, MacArthur, on his own initiative, ordered the transport ship [[USNS Sgt. George D Keathley (T-APC-117)|MSTS ''Sgt. George D Keathley'']], then in harbor in [[Yokohama]], to be loaded with ammunition and to sail for [[Pusan]].{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=65–66}} President Truman met with the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and other advisors that day at [[Blair House]] and approved the actions already taken by MacArthur and [[Secretary of State]] [[Dean Acheson]].{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=68–69}} At another meeting at Blair House held on the evening of 26 June, amid reports of a rapidly deteriorating situation in South Korea, Truman approved the use of air and naval forces against military targets south of the [[38th parallel north]].{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|p=72}}

Subsequently, on 27 June, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 83|Resolution 83]], which recommended that "members of the United Nations furnish such assistance to the Republic of Korea as may be necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = UN Security Council Resolution 83 | date = 27 June 1950 | url = http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3b00f20a2c.html | publisher = United Nations | accessdate = 14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South Korean capital of [[Seoul]] fell on 28 June.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|p=71}} The next day, Truman authorized air and naval operations north of the 38th parallel, which MacArthur had already ordered.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=76–77}} However it was not until 30 June, following a sobering report on the military situation from MacArthur, that Truman finally authorized the use of ground forces.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=78–79}}

On 8 July, on the advice on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Truman appointed MacArthur as commander of the [[United Nations]] Command in South Korea (CINCUNC).{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|p=102}} He remained CINCFE and SCAP.{{sfn|Lowe|1990|p=629}} MacArthur was forced to commit his forces in Japan to what he later described as a "desperate rearguard action."{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|p=106}} In July Truman sent the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chief of Staff of the Army]], General [[J. Lawton Collins]], and the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the Air Force]], General [[Hoyt S. Vandenberg]], to report on the situation. They met with MacArthur and his chief of staff, Major General [[Edward Almond]], in Tokyo on 13 July. MacArthur impressed on them the danger of underestimating the North Koreans, whom he characterized as "well-equipped, well-led, and battle-trained, and which have at times out-numbered our troops by as much as twenty to one."{{sfn|Matray|1979|p=320}} He proposed to first halt the North Korean advance and then counterattack, enveloping the North Koreans with an amphibious operation, but the timing was dependent on the arrival of reinforcements from the United States.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=106–107}}

Bradley raised the possibility of using [[nuclear weapons]] in Korea at a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting on 9 July 1950 at Eisenhower's instigation, but there was no support for the idea. The Army staff sent a cable to Collins in Tokyo suggesting that he seek out MacArthur's opinion.{{sfn|Crane|2000|pp=37–39}} In a teleconference on 13 July, [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Charles L. Bolte]] proposed sending nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Weintraub|2000|p=252}} MacArthur had already turned down Air Force proposals to fire bomb North Korean cities,{{sfn|Crane|2000|p=32}} and suggested that atomic bombs could be used to isolate North Korea by taking out bridges and tunnels. The Army staff considered this impractical.{{sfn|Crane|2000|pp=37–39}}{{sfn|Cumings|1990|pp=749–750}} However, on 28 July, the Joint Chiefs decided to send ten nuclear-capable [[B-29]] bombers of the [[9th Bombardment Wing]] to [[Guam]] as a deterrent to Chinese action against Taiwan. Truman publicly denied that he was considering the use of nuclear weapons in Korea, but authorised the transfer to Guam of atomic bombs without their [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|fissile cores]].{{sfn|Dingman|1988–1989|pp=62-63}} The deployment did not go well; one of the bombers crashed on takeoff from [[Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base]] in California on 5 August, killing the mission commander, [[Brigadier General]] [[Robert F. Travis]], and 18 others.&lt;ref name=B29crash&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Travis_B-29_crash_site.htm |title=The Crash of the B-29 on Travis AFB, CA |publisher=Check-Six.com |date=17 March 2011 |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining nine bombers remained in Guam until 13 September, when they returned to the United States. The bomb assemblies stayed behind.{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|pp=445–446}}

At a press conference on 13 July, Truman was asked if United States forces would cross the 38th parallel into North Korea, and he replied that he would "make that decision when it becomes necessary to do it."{{sfn|Matray|1979|p=320}} Some of his advisors, most notably the [[Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs]], [[Dean Rusk]], and the Director of the Office of Northeast Asian Affairs, [[John M. Allison]], argued that Security Council Resolution 83 provided a legal basis for the invasion of North Korea. Others, notably [[George F. Kennan]] and [[Paul Nitze]], disagreed. In addition to the legality, the administration also had to consider the danger of intervention by the [[Soviet Union]] or the [[People's Republic of China]] if United Nations forces approached their borders.{{sfn|Matray|1979|p=323}}

=== Battle of Inchon ===
{{further|Battle of Inchon}}
MacArthur's early ambitions for an amphibious operation against North Korea had to be shelved due to the deteriorating situation in the south, which compelled him to commit the formation earmarked for the assault, the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], to the defence of the [[Pusan Perimeter]],{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=138–140}} to which the [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth Army]] retreated in August.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=127, 145}} MacArthur then resumed his planning for an amphibious operation, which he tentatively scheduled for 15 September 1950. Navy and Marine Corps officers like [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[James H. Doyle]], the commander of [[Task Force 76|Amphibious Group One]], and [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Oliver P. Smith]], the commander of the [[1st Marine Division]], were appalled by the proposed landing beaches at [[Inchon]], which featured huge tides, broad mudflats, narrow and treacherous channels, and high seawalls.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|p=147}} Omar Bradley called it "the worst possible place ever selected for an amphibious landing."{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=87}} While the Inchon-Seoul area was a key communications center, the risks of the landing were daunting. Collins and Sherman flew to Tokyo to be briefed on the plans by MacArthur,{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=150–151}} who declared: "We shall land at Inchon, and I shall crush them."{{sfn|Matray|1979|p=326}}

Almond is pointing something out to him.]]
MacArthur was invited to speak at the 51st National Encampment of the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] in Chicago on 26 August 1950. He declined the invitation, but instead sent a statement that could be read out aloud,{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|p=370}} in which he contradicted Truman's policy towards the island of [[Formosa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/korea/large/korea824_28.htm.bak |title=The Truman Library: Holding the Line 24–28 August 1950 |publisher=[[Harry S.

Johnson]]. Johnson responded that MacArthur was "one of the greatest, if not the greatest generals of our generation."{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=96}} Truman told Johnson to send MacArthur an order withdrawing his statement, which he did; but it had already been read into [[Congressional Record]]. As it turned out, it was not MacArthur who was relieved, but Johnson. Truman had become irritated with Johnson's conflict with Secretary of State Acheson, and although he had said that Johnson would remain his Secretary of Defense for "as long as I am President,"{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=216}} he asked Johnson for his resignation.{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=98}} Publicly, Johnson received much of the blame for the defense cuts that had led to the lack of preparedness and consequent early defeats in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.defense.gov/johnson.shtml |title=Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson |publisher=Office of the Secretary of Defense |accessdate=20 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609051253/http://history.defense.gov/johnson.shtml |archivedate=9 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by General of the Army [[George Marshall]].{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=98}}

MacArthur held that his military objective was the destruction of the North Korean Army. That being the case, operations would be necessary north of the 38th parallel, although his Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, Major General [[Charles A. Willoughby]], warned on 31 August that 37 Chinese divisions were grouping on the border between China and North Korea. The Joint Chiefs agreed with MacArthur on this issue.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=179–180}} A [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] paper endorsed the legality of action north of the 38th parallel. The paper recommended that only South Korean troops be employed in the border regions with China and Russia. Should the Soviet Union intervene, MacArthur was to immediately retreat to the 38th parallel; but in the case of Chinese intervention, he was to keep fighting "as long as action by UN military forces offers a reasonable chance of successful resistance."{{sfn|Matray|1979|pp=326–328}} Truman endorsed the report on 11 September, but MacArthur remained in the dark because of the changeover of Secretaries of Defense, and was not informed until 22 September.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=180–181}} When Truman was asked at a press conference on 21 September whether he had concluded to conduct operations in North Korea, he replied that he had not.{{sfn|Matray|1979|p=331}}

In the meantime, MacArthur's [[Battle of Inchon|amphibious assault at Inchon]] went ahead on 15 September. "The success of Inchon was so great and the subsequent prestige of General MacArthur was so overpowering," Collins later recalled, "that the Chiefs hesitated thereafter to question later plans and decisions of the general, which should have been challenged."{{sfn|James|1985|p=485}} In response to a rumor that the Eighth Army planned to halt at the 38th parallel and await United Nations authorization to cross, Marshall sent a message to MacArthur informing him that: "We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of 38th parallel. Announcement above referred to may precipitate embarrassment in the UN where evident desire is not to be confronted with necessity of a vote on passage, rather to find you have found it militarily necessary to do so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/koreanwar/documents/index.php?documentdate=1950-09-29&amp;documentid=ki-22-19&amp;pagenumber=1 | title = George C. Marshall to Douglas MacArthur, 29 September 1950. Naval Aide Files, Truman Papers. | publisher = Harry S. Truman Library and Museum | accessdate = 9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, MacArthur was instructed not to issue an announcement that his forces had crossed the 38th parallel.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|p=183}} On 7 October a United Nations General Assembly Resolution was passed that could be broadly construed as permitting the invasion of North Korea.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|p=194}}

=== Wake Island Conference ===
{{main|Wake Island Conference}}
With the 1950 mid-term elections drawing near, and Truman abstaining from overt campaigning while the troops were fighting in Korea, members of Truman's staff, most notably [[George Elsey]], came up with another way to garner votes for the Democratic Party.{{sfn|Casey|2008|p=113}}{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=111}}{{sfn|James|1985|pp=590–591}} In July 1944, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] had traveled to Hawaii to meet with MacArthur and Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]]. At this meeting, Roosevelt made the decision to attack the Philippines in the final year of the Pacific war.{{sfn|James|1975|p=526}} It was a political triumph in an election year, refuting Republican claims that Roosevelt fixated on Europe at the expense of the Pacific.{{sfn|Casey|2008|pp=114–115}}

Truman emulated this by flying to the Pacific to meet MacArthur. Initially, Truman was unenthusiastic about the idea, as he disliked publicity stunts,{{sfn|Casey|2008|p=113}} but in October 1950, in the wake of the victories at Pusan and Inchon, MacArthur's star was burning bright.{{sfn|Wiltz|1978|p=170}} By meeting with him, Truman could emphasize his own part in the victories, as Commander-in-Chief.{{sfn|Casey|2008|p=113}} A message was sent to MacArthur suggesting a meeting on Hawaii or [[Wake Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/koreanwar/documents/index.php?documentdate=1950-10-09&amp;documentid=ki-15-2&amp;pagenumber=1 | title = Notes Regarding President Truman's Trip to Hawaii, 9 October 1950. Secretary of State File, Acheson Papers | publisher = Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum | accessdate = 7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacArthur replied that he "would be delighted to meet the President on the morning of the 15th at Wake Island."{{sfn|James|1985|p=500}} When MacArthur discovered that the President would be bringing the news media with him, MacArthur asked if he could bring correspondents from Tokyo. His request was denied.{{sfn|James|1985|p=501}}

Truman arrived at Wake Island on 15 October, where he was greeted on the tarmac by MacArthur, who had arrived the day before.{{sfn|James|1985|pp=503–504}} MacArthur shook hands with the President rather than salute, and declined an offer to stay for lunch with the President which Bradley considered "insulting".{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=113}} This did not bother Truman; what did annoy the President, a former [[haberdasher]], was MacArthur's "greasy [[Scrambled egg (uniform)|ham and eggs cap]] that evidently had been in use for twenty years."{{sfn|James|1985|p=504}} The meeting, which had no agenda and no structure, took the form of a free-wheeling discussion between the President and his advisors on one hand, and MacArthur and the [[CINCPAC]], Admiral [[Arthur Radford]], on the other. Topics discussed included Formosa, the Philippines and the wars in [[First Indochina War|Vietnam]] and Korea.{{sfn|Wiltz|1978|p=172}} MacArthur noted that "No new policies, no new strategy of war or international politics, were proposed or discussed."{{sfn|James|1985|p=514}} [[Robert Sherrod]], who was present as a correspondent felt that he "had witnessed nothing but a political grandstand play."{{sfn|James|1985|p=515}}

However, MacArthur did say things that would later be used against him.{{sfn|James|1985|pp=515–517}}{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|p=362}} When asked by the President about the odds of Soviet or Chinese intervention in Korea, MacArthur replied:
{{quote|Very little. Had they interfered in the first or second months it would have been decisive. We are no longer fearful of their intervention. We no longer stand hat in hand. The Chinese have 300,000 men in [[Manchuria]]. Of these probably not more than 100–115,000 are distributed along the [[Yalu River]]. Only 50–60,000 could be gotten across the Yalu River. They have no Air Force. Now that we have bases for our Air Force in Korea if the Chinese tried to get down to [[Pyongyang]] there would be the greatest slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/wake/Wi198_1.htm | title = Substance of Statements made at Wake Island Conference, dated 15 October 1950, compiled by General of the Army Omar N.

Truman Presidential Library and Museum | accessdate = 7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
MacArthur expressed the hope that the Eighth Army could withdraw to Japan by the end of the year. When Bradley asked if a division could be sent to Europe, MacArthur replied that he could make one available in January.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|p=212}} In fact, Chinese troops had already begun crossing the Yalu into North Korea, and by November 180,000 had done so.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|p=233}}

=== Chinese intervention ===
When he returned from Wake, MacArthur faced the challenge of turning his promises into reality. On 24 October, he ordered his principal subordinates, [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Walton Walker]], the commander of the Eighth Army, and Major General [[Edward Almond]] of [[X Corps (United States)|X Corps]], to "drive forward with all speed and full utilization of all their force."{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=119}} He also lifted the prohibition on troops other than South Koreans operating along the borders with China and the Soviet Union. Collins considered this a violation of the orders that the Joint Chiefs had issued on 27 September,{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|p=218}} but MacArthur pointed out that it was only, in the words of the original directive, "a matter of policy."{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=119}} He added that the matter had been raised at Wake Island, but no one else recalled this,{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=119}} particularly not Truman, who, unaware of these discussions, told reporters on 26 October that Koreans and not Americans would occupy the border areas.{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=120}} Within days, MacArthur's forces had encountered the Chinese in the [[Battle of Onjong]] and the [[Battle of Unsan]].{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=234–235}}

Truman did not relieve MacArthur for the military reverses in Korea in November and December 1950. Truman later stated that he felt that MacArthur was no more to blame than General of the Army [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was for the military reverses he had suffered during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. But this did not mean that it did not factor into his decision.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|p=366}} "I considered him a great strategist," Truman later recalled, "until he made the march into North Korea without the knowledge that he should have had of the Chinese coming in."{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=135}}

In an attempt to slow the Chinese advance, MacArthur ordered the bridges across the Yalu to be bombed. After due consultation with his advisers, Truman declared that he would not approve of such an action, and the Joint Chiefs cancelled the order.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|p=242}} When MacArthur protested, the President and the Joint Chiefs authorized the bombings, subject to the caveat that Chinese air space not be violated. Major General [[Emmett O'Donnell]] would later cite this to the Congressional inquiry into MacArthur's relief as an example of undue political interference in military operations. The Yalu River had many bends, and in some cases there were very restricted lines of approach without overflying the Yalu. This made life easier for the Communist antiaircraft gunners, but correspondingly less so for the aircrew.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=244–246}} Within weeks, MacArthur was forced to retreat, and both Truman and MacArthur were forced to contemplate the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=286–287}}

=== Nuclear weapons ===
At a press conference on 30 November 1950, Truman was asked about the use of nuclear weapons:{{quote|'''Q.''' Mr. President, I wonder if we could retrace that reference to the atom bomb? Did we understand you clearly that the use of the atomic bomb is under active consideration?&lt;br /&gt;'''Truman''': Always has been. It is one of our weapons.&lt;br /&gt;'''Q.''' Does that mean, Mr. President, use against military objectives, or civilian—&lt;br /&gt;'''Truman''': It's a matter that the military people will have to decide. I'm not a military authority that passes on those things.&lt;br /&gt;'''Q.''' Mr. President, perhaps it would be better if we are allowed to quote your remarks on that directly?&lt;br /&gt;'''Truman:''' I don't think—I don't think that is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;'''Q.''' Mr. President, you said this depends on United Nations action.

On 9 December 1950, MacArthur requested field commander's discretion to employ nuclear weapons; he testified that such an employment would only be used to prevent an ultimate fallback, not to recover the situation in Korea.{{sfn|Weintraub|2000|p=263}} On 24 December 1950, MacArthur submitted a list of "retardation targets" in Korea, [[Manchuria]] and other parts of China, for which 34 atomic bombs would be required.{{sfn|Weintraub|2000|p=263}}{{sfn|Grosscup|2013|p=78}}{{sfn|Crane|2000|p=71}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cumings|1990|p=750}} says 26 bombs.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Major General [[Courtney Whitney]], MacArthur considered a proposal by Louis Johnson to use radioactive wastes to seal off North Korea, but never submitted this to the Joint Chiefs.{{sfn|James|1985|pp=578–579}} In January 1951, he refused to entertain proposals for the forward deployment of nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Dingman|1988–1989|p=68}}

[[File:Buster-Jangle shot with personnel.jpg|thumb|left|Military personnel observe [[Operation Buster-Jangle]] in November 1951.|alt=A mushroom cloud rise over the desert, watched by seven men in uniforms.]]
In early April 1951, the Joint Chiefs became alarmed by the build up of Soviet forces in the Far East, particularly bombers and submarines.{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|p=449}} On 5 April 1951, they drafted orders for MacArthur authorizing attacks on Manchuria and the [[Shantung Peninsula]] if the Chinese launched airstrikes against his forces originating from there.{{sfn|James|1985|p=591}} The next day Truman met with the chairman of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]], [[Gordon Dean (lawyer)|Gordon Dean]],{{sfn|Anders|1988|pp=1–2}} and arranged for the transfer of nine [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]]s to military control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hnn.us/articles/9245.html | publisher = [[History News Network]] | title = Why Did Truman Really Fire MacArthur? ...

There has been debate whether MacArthur advocated the employment of nuclear weapons, including over whether his submission to the Joint Chiefs of Staff was tantamount to a recommendation.{{sfn|Buhite|2008|p=137}}{{sfn|Sechser|Fuhrmann|2017|p=179}} In his testimony before the Senate Inquiry, he stated that he had not recommended their use.&lt;ref&gt;Senate Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Relations, 15 May 1951—''Military Situation in the Far East'', hearings, 82d Congress, 1st session, part 1, p. 77 (1951).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, MacArthur challenged a statement by Truman that he had wanted to use nuclear weapons, saying that "atomic bombing in the Korean War was never discussed either by my headquarters or in any communication to or from Washington"; Truman, admitting that he did not have documentation of any such claim, said that he was merely providing his personal opinion.{{sfn|James|1985|p=581}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author =&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;| title = A-Bomb Blow at M'Arthur Only 'Opinion'| url = http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1960/12/24/page/1/article/truman-dodges-charges| newspaper= Chicago Daily Tribune | location= Chicago| date= 24 December 1960 | access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interview with [[Jim G.

I could have won the war in Korea in a maximum of 10 days.... I would have dropped between 30 and 50 atomic bombs on his air bases and other depots strung across the neck of Manchuria.... It was my plan as our amphibious forces moved south to spread behind us—from the Sea of Japan to the Yellow Sea—a belt of radioactive cobalt. It could have been spread from wagons, carts, trucks and planes.... For at least 60 years there could have been no land invasion of Korea from the north. The enemy could not have marched across that radiated belt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/09/texts-of-accounts-by-lucas-and-considine-on-interviews-with-macarthur-in-1954.html |title=Texts of Accounts by Lucas and Considine on Interviews With MacArthur in 1954 |newspaper=New York Times |date=9 April 1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1985 [[Richard Nixon]] recalled discussing the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] with MacArthur:
{{quote|MacArthur once spoke to me very eloquently about it, pacing the floor of his apartment in the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel|Waldorf]]. He thought it a tragedy the bomb was ever exploded. MacArthur believed that the same restrictions ought to apply to atomic weapons as to conventional weapons, that the military objective should always be limited damage to noncombatants... MacArthur, you see, was a soldier. He believed in using force only against military targets, and that is why the nuclear thing turned him off, which I think speaks well of him.{{sfn|Alperovitz|1995|p=352}}}}

=== Foreign pressure ===

There are surrounded by a crowd of people, all dressed warmly. In the background is a propeller driven airliner.]]
The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], [[Clement Attlee]], was particularly disturbed by Truman's gaffe about nuclear weapons, and sought to revive the wartime [[Quebec Agreement]], under which the United States would not use nuclear weapons without Britain's consent.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=289–292}} The British were concerned that the United States was drifting into a war with China.{{sfn|Spanier|1959|pp=166–167}} In a visit to the United States in December 1950, Attlee raised the fears of the British and other European governments that "General MacArthur was running the show." As MacArthur's views about the importance of Asia in world affairs were well known, it was feared that United States would shift its focus away from Europe.{{sfn|Lowe|1990|p=636}} In this instance, MacArthur was defended by Bradley,{{sfn|Lowe|1990|pp=636–637}} whose [[anglophobia]] dated back to World War II.{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=233}}

The British became alarmed in January 1951 when the Americans began talking of evacuating Korea. The British argued that to maintain European faith and unity it was vital to maintain some presence in Korea, even if it was nothing more than a toehold in the Pusan area. Once again, Bradley defended MacArthur, but it was clear that he had become an irritant in the relationship between the two countries.{{sfn|Lowe|1990|pp=638–641}} However, the alliance with Britain itself was unpopular in Congress.{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|pp=230–232}} [[House Minority Leader]] [[Joseph William Martin, Jr.]] slammed Truman for following Attlee's Britain to "slavery to government and crippling debt."{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|pp=230–232}}

=== Public statements ===
On 1 December 1950, MacArthur was asked by a reporter if the restrictions on operations against Chinese forces on the far side of the Yalu River were "a handicap to effective military operations." He replied that they were indeed "an enormous handicap, unprecedented in military history."{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=170}} On 6 December, Truman issued a directive requiring all military officers and diplomatic officials to clear with the State Department all but routine statements before making them public, "and...refrain from direct communications on military or foreign policy with newspapers, magazines, and other publicity media."&lt;ref name="gag order"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/exhibit_documents/index.php?pagenumber=5&amp;titleid=186&amp;tldate=1951-04-07&amp;collectionid=firem&amp;PageID=-1&amp;groupid=3414 | title = Harry S. Truman to Omar Bradley, with attachments | date = 6 December 1950 | publisher = Harry S. Truman Library and Museum | accessdate = 9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major General [[Courtney Whitney]] gave MacArthur a legal opinion that this applied "solely to formal public statements and not to communiqués, correspondence or personal conversations."{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=175}} MacArthur made similar remarks in press statements on 13 February and 7 March 1951.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|p=373}}

In February and March 1951, the tide of war began to turn again, and MacArthur's forces drove north. Seoul, which had fallen on 4 January,{{sfn|Mossman|1990|pp=202–204}} was recaptured on 17 March.{{sfn|Mossman|1990|pp=328–330}} This raised hopes in Washington that the Chinese and North Koreans might be amenable to a ceasefire agreement, and Truman prepared a statement to this effect. MacArthur was informed of it by the Joint Chiefs on 20 March, and he warned the new commander of the Eighth Army, Lieutenant General [[Matthew B. Ridgway]], that political constraints might soon impose limits on his proposed operations.{{sfn|Mossman|1990|pp=344–347}} On 23 March, MacArthur issued a communiqué about offering a ceasefire to the Chinese:{{quote|Of even greater significance than our tactical successes has been the clear revelation that this new enemy, Red China, of such exaggerated and vaunted military power, lacks the industrial capability to provide adequately many critical items necessary to the conduct of modern war. He lacks the manufacturing base and those raw materials needed to produce, maintain and operate even moderate air and naval power, and he cannot provide the essentials for successful ground operations, such as tanks, heavy artillery and other refinements science has introduced into the conduct of military campaigns. Formerly his great numerical potential might well have filled this gap but with the development of existing methods of mass destruction numbers alone do not offset the vulnerability inherent in such deficiencies. Control of the seas and the air, which in turn means control over supplies, communications and transportation, are no less essential and decisive now than in the past. When this control exists, as in our case, and is coupled with an inferiority of ground firepower in the enemy's case, the resulting disparity is such that it cannot be overcome by bravery, however fanatical, or the most gross indifference to human loss.

These military weaknesses have been clearly and definitely revealed since Red China entered upon its undeclared war in Korea. Even under the inhibitions which now restrict the activity of the United Nations forces and the corresponding military advantages which accrue to Red China, it has been shown its complete inability to accomplish by force of arms the conquest of Korea. The enemy, therefore must by now be painfully aware that a decision of the United Nations to depart from its tolerant effort to contain the war to the area of Korea, through an expansion of our military operations to its coastal areas and interior bases, would doom Red China to the risk of imminent military collapse. These basic facts being established, there should be no insuperable difficulty in arriving at decisions on the Korean problem if the issues are resolved on their own merits, without being burdened by extraneous matters not directly related to Korea, such as Formosa or China's seat in the United Nations.{{sfn|James|1985|p=586}}}}

The next day, MacArthur authorized Ridgway to advance up to {{convert|20|mi}} north of the 38th Parallel.{{sfn|Mossman|1990|pp=344–347}} Truman would later report that "I was ready to kick him into the North China Sea...I was never so put out in my life."{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=998}} Truman felt that MacArthur's communiqué, which had not been cleared in accordance with the December directive, had pre-empted his own proposal. He later wrote:{{quote|This was a most extraordinary statement for a military commander of the United Nations to issue on his own responsibility. It was an act totally disregarding all directives to abstain from any declarations on foreign policy. It was in open defiance of my orders as President and as Commander-in-Chief. This was a challenge to the authority of the President under the Constitution. It also flouted the policy of the United Nations. By this act MacArthur left me no choice—I could no longer tolerate his insubordination.{{sfn|Truman|1965|pp=441–442}}}}

For the moment, however, he did. There had been dramatic confrontations over policy before, the most notable of which was between President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and Major General [[George McClellan]], in 1862.{{sfn|Owens|1994–1995|pp=72–75}} Another example was President [[James Polk]]'s recall of Major General [[Winfield Scott]] after the [[Mexican–American War]]. Before relieving MacArthur, Truman consulted history books on how Lincoln and Polk dealt with their generals.{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=183}} Truman later said that Polk was his favorite president because "he had the courage to tell Congress to go to Hell on foreign policy matters."{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=187}}

There were genuine differences of opinion over policy between MacArthur and the Truman administration. One was MacArthur's deep-seated belief that it was not possible to separate the struggle against Communism in Europe from that going on in Asia.{{sfn|James|1985|pp=614–615}} This was seen as the result of being stationed for too many years in the Orient, and of his perspective as a theater commander responsible only for part of the Far East. Another important policy difference was MacArthur's belief that China was not, as Acheson maintained, "the Soviet Union's largest and most important satellite,"{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=225}} but an independent state with its own agenda that, in MacArthur's words, "for its own purposes is [just temporarily] allied with Soviet Russia."{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=224}} If MacArthur's thesis was accepted, then it followed that expanding the war with China would not provoke a conflict with the Soviet Union. The Joint Chiefs emphatically disagreed, although this contradicted their position that it was Europe and not Asia that was the prime concern of the Soviet Union. Even among Republicans, there was little support for MacArthur's position.{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|pp=222–227}}

On 5 April, Martin read the text of a letter he had received from MacArthur, dated 20 March, criticizing the Truman administration's priorities on the floor of the House. In it, MacArthur had written:{{quote|It seems strangely difficult for some to realize that here in Asia is where the Communist conspirators have elected to make their play for global conquest, and that we have joined the issue thus raised on the battlefield; that here we fight Europe's war with arms while the diplomatic there still fight it with words; that if we lose the war to communism in Asia the fall of Europe is inevitable; win it and Europe most probably would avoid war and yet preserve freedom. As you pointed out, we must win. There is no substitute for victory.{{sfn|James|1985|p=590}}}}

MacArthur later wrote that Martin had released the letter "for some unexplained reason and without consulting me",{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|p=389}} but it had not been marked as being confidential or off the record.{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=180}}

=== Diplomatic dispatch intercepts ===
The practice of intercepting and decrypting diplomatic messages of friend and foe alike was a closely held secret in the 1950s. In mid-March 1951, Truman learned through such intercepts that MacArthur had conversations with diplomats in Spain's and Portugal's Tokyo embassies. In these talks, MacArthur had expressed confidence that he would succeed in expanding the Korean War into a major conflict resulting in the permanent disposal of the "Chinese Communist question" and MacArthur did not want either country to be alarmed if this happened. The content of this particular intercept was known by only a very few of Truman's closest advisers, two being [[Paul Nitze]], Director of the Policy Planning Staff of the State Department and his associate, Charles Burton Marshall. Truman considered MacArthur's conversations to be outright treachery and concluded that MacArthur had to be relieved, but was unable to act immediately because of MacArthur's political support and to avoid wider knowledge of the existence of the electronic intercepts of diplomatic messages.{{sfn|Goulden|1982|pp=476-478}}{{sfn|Nitze|Smith|Rearden|1989|pp=109-111}}{{sfn|Marshall|1989|pp=115-117}}

=== Provoking China ===
Ridgway had prepared an offensive known as [[Operation Courageous#Operations Rugged and Dauntless|Operation Rugged]], and pressed MacArthur for permission to launch it. On 15 March 1951, the day after Seoul had been recaptured a second time, Truman had responded to a reporter's question about whether UN forces would again be allowed to move north of the 38th Parallel by saying that it would be "a tactical matter for the field commander". MacArthur thereupon gave Ridgway permission to launch his attack, setting an objective line north of the 38th Parallel that would secure Seoul's water supply. He did so without consulting with Washington until after the attack began on 5 April 1951. It was making steady progress when MacArthur was relieved on 11 April.{{sfn|Schnabel|Watson|1998|pp=215–216}}

Following the completion of flight operations the evening of 7 April 1951, [[Task Force 77 (United States Navy)|Task Force 77]], the [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]]'s fast carrier task force, with the carriers {{USS|Boxer|CV-21|6}} and {{USS|Philippine Sea|CV-47|6}}, departed Korean waters in the [[Sea of Japan]] bound for the [[Straits of Formosa]]. At 11:00 on 11 April, [[Task Force 77 (United States Navy)|Task Force 77]] operating near the west coast of Taiwan, commenced an "aerial parade" along the east coast of mainland China.{{sfn|Marolda|2012|pp=34–35}} Concurrently, the [[destroyer]] {{USS|John A. Bole|DD-755|6}} arrived at its assigned station {{convert|3|mile}} offshore from the Chinese seaport of [[Shantou|Swatow (Shantou)]], provoking the Chinese to surround it with an armada of over 40 armed powered junks. Although Task Force 77 was conducting its aerial parade over the horizon to the west, nearly two hours passed before aircraft from the task force appeared over Swatow and made threatening passes at the Chinese vessels and the port city.{{sfn|Alexander|1997|pp=74–77}} MacArthur officially received notification of his dismissal shortly after 15:00 Tokyo time (14:00 on the China coast), although he had found out about it half an hour before.{{sfn|Mossman|1990|p=364}} Two hours later, the ''Bole'' retired from its station without hostile action being initiated by either side. Author James Edwin Alexander expressed little doubt that the ''Bole'' and its crew were made "sitting ducks" by MacArthur trying to provoke the Chinese into attacking a U.S. warship in an attempt to expand the conflict.{{sfn|Alexander|1997|pp=74–77}}

== Relief ==

On the morning of 6 April 1951, Truman held a meeting in his office with Marshall, Bradley, Acheson and Harriman to discuss what would be done about MacArthur. Harriman was emphatically in favor of MacArthur's relief, but Bradley opposed it. George Marshall asked for more time to consider the matter. Acheson was personally in favor of relieving MacArthur but did not disclose this. Instead, he warned Truman that it would be "the biggest fight of your administration."{{sfn|Schnabel|Watson|1998|pp=246–247}} At a second meeting the next day, Marshall and Bradley continued to oppose relief. On 8 April, the Joint Chiefs met with Marshall in his office. Each of the chiefs in turn expressed the opinion that MacArthur's relief was desirable from a "military point of view," but they recognized that military considerations were not paramount. They were concerned that "if MacArthur were not relieved, a large segment of our people would charge that civil authorities no longer controlled the military."{{sfn|Schnabel|Watson|1998|pp=246–247}} The four advisers met with Truman in his office again on 9 April. Bradley informed the President of the views of the Joint Chiefs, and Marshall added that he agreed with them.{{sfn|Schnabel|Watson|1998|pp=246–247}} Truman wrote in his diary that "it is of unanimous opinion of all that MacArthur be relieved. All four so advise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/exhibit_documents/index.php?pagenumber=2&amp;titleid=188&amp;tldate=1951-04-06&amp;collectionid=firem&amp;PageID=1&amp;groupid=3416 | accessdate = 5 June 2011 | title = Diary entries, 6–7, April 1951, Truman Papers. | publisher = Harry S. Truman Library and Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, before Congress, the Joint Chiefs would insist that they had only "concurred" with the relief, not "recommended" it.{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=214}}

On 11 April 1951, President Truman drafted an order to MacArthur, which was issued under Bradley's signature:
{{quote|I deeply regret that it becomes my duty as President and Commander-in-Chief of the United States military forces to replace you as Supreme Commander, Allied Powers; Commander-in-Chief, United Nations Command; Commander-in-Chief, Far East; and Commanding General, U.S. Army, Far East.

You will turn over your commands, effective at once, to Lt. Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway. You are authorized to have issued such orders as are necessary to complete desired travel to such place as you select.

My reasons for your replacement, will be made public concurrently with the delivery to you of the foregoing order, and are contained in the next following message.&lt;ref name="Relieving MacArthur of his command"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.digitalvaults.org/record/3392.html | title = Relieving MacArthur of his command | date = 11 April 1951 | publisher = [[Foundation for the National Archives]] | accessdate = 25 June 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100613185432/http://digitalvaults.org/record/3392.html | archivedate = 13 June 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 3 December 1973 article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Truman was quoted as saying in the early 1960s:
{{quote|I fired him because he wouldn't respect the authority of the President. I didn't fire him because he was a dumb son of a bitch, although he was, but that's not against the law for generals. If it was, half to three-quarters of them would be in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908217,00.html | newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | title = Historical Notes: Giving Them More Hell | date=3 December 1973 | accessdate = 17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Truman and Acheson accused MacArthur of insubordination, the Joint Chiefs avoided any suggestion of this.{{sfn|James|1985|p=594}} MacArthur was not, in fact, relieved for insubordination. Insubordination was a military offense, and MacArthur could have requested a public court martial similar to that of [[Billy Mitchell]] in the 1920s. The outcome of such a trial was uncertain, and it might well have found him not guilty and ordered his reinstatement.{{sfn|Meilinger|1989|p=179}} The Joint Chiefs agreed that there was "little evidence that General MacArthur had ever failed to carry out a direct order of the Joint Chiefs, or acted in opposition to an order." "In point of fact," Bradley insisted, "MacArthur had stretched but not legally violated any JCS directives. He had violated the President's 6 December directive, relayed to him by the JCS, but this did not constitute violation of a JCS order."{{sfn|James|1985|p=594}}

The intention was that MacArthur would be personally notified of his relief by [[Secretary of the Army]] [[Frank Pace]], who was touring the front in Korea, at 20:00 on 11 April ([[Eastern Time Zone|Washington, D.C. time]]), which was 10:00 on 12 April ([[Japan Standard Time|Tokyo time]]). However, Pace did not receive the message due to a signals failure in Korea. Meanwhile, reporters began asking if rumors of MacArthur's relief were true. Truman then "decided that we could not afford the courtesy of Secretary Pace's personal delivery of the order," and called a press conference at which he issued his statement to the press:{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=376–377}}{{sfn|James|1985|pp=596–597}}
{{quote|With deep regret I have concluded that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur is unable to give his wholehearted support to the policies of the United States Government and of the United Nations in matters pertaining to his official duties. In view of the specific responsibilities imposed upon me by the Constitution of the United States and the added responsibility which has been entrusted to me by the United Nations, I have decided that I must make a change of command in the Far East. I have, therefore, relieved General MacArthur of his commands and have designated Lt. Gen. [[Matthew B. Ridgway]] as his successor.

Full and vigorous debate on matters of national policy is a vital element in the constitutional system of our free democracy. It is fundamental, however, that military commanders must be governed by the policies and directives issued to them in the manner provided by our laws and Constitution. In time of crisis, this consideration is particularly compelling.

General MacArthur's place in history as one of our greatest commanders is fully established. The Nation owes him a debt of gratitude for the distinguished and exceptional service which he has rendered his country in posts of great responsibility. For that reason I repeat my regret at the necessity for the action I feel compelled to take in his case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/exhibit_documents/index.php?tldate=0000-00-00&amp;groupid=3461&amp;pagenumber=1&amp;collectionid=firem | title = Proposed draft messages to Frank Pace, Douglas MacArthur, and Matthew Ridgway | publisher = Harry S.

In Tokyo, MacArthur and his wife were at a luncheon at the [[Embassy of the United States in Tokyo|American embassy]] for Senator [[Warren Magnuson]] and William Stern, executive vice president of [[Northwest Airlines]], when Colonel Sidney Huff, MacArthur's aide and one of the "Bataan gang" who had escaped from Corregidor with the general in 1942, heard about the relief from commercial radio broadcast. Huff promptly informed Mrs. MacArthur, who in turn told the general. Japanese radio stations soon picked up the story, but the official notice would not arrive for another half hour.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|pp=376–377}}{{sfn|James|1985|pp=596–597}}

== Issues ==

=== Civilian control of the military ===
[[Civilian control of the military]] is an American tradition dating back to the founding of the republic.{{sfn|Spanier|1959|p=9}} In his 1956 memoirs, Truman wrote:{{quote|If there is one basic element in our Constitution, it is civilian control of the military. Policies are to be made by the elected political officials, not by generals or admirals. Yet time and again General MacArthur had shown that he was unwilling to accept the policies of the administration. By his repeated public statements he was not only confusing our allies as to the true course of our policies but, in fact, was also setting his policy against the President's... If I allowed him to defy the civil authorities in this manner, I myself would be violating my oath to uphold and defend the Constitution.{{sfn|Truman|1965|p=444}}}}
Following the relief, most of the avalanche of mail and messages sent to the White House by the public supported MacArthur. On issues like character, integrity, honor and service, they rated MacArthur as the better man. What support Truman garnered was largely based on the principle of civilian control.{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=203}}

"The United States Constitution", wrote [[Samuel P. Huntington]], "despite widespread belief to the contrary, does {{em|not}} provide for civilian control."{{sfn|Huntington|1957|p=163}} It drew no distinction between civil and military responsibilities, and provided for no subordination of the one to the other. By dividing responsibility for the military between the executive and the legislature, it made control more difficult. Any attempt by one branch to assert control would likely involve a clash with the other. Debates nominally about civilian control were usually, in practice, about which branch would exercise control rather than how control would be exercised.{{sfn|Huntington|1957|p=163}} The framers of the constitution did not consider the issue of the management of a distinct and technically sophisticated military profession because no such thing existed at the time.{{sfn|Huntington|1957|p=165}} It appeared in the 19th century as a result of social changes brought about by the [[French Revolution]], and technological changes wrought by the [[industrial revolution]].{{sfn|Huntington|1957|pp=32–35}} While the framers believed in civilian control of the military, they framed it in terms of a people's militia in which civilian and military were one and the same.{{sfn|Huntington|1957|pp=166–167}}

=== Apolitical military ===
Another American tradition is that of an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, but not so much from a lack of interest in politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of many states.{{sfn|Huntington|1957|pp=258–259}} Under General of the Army [[William T. Sherman]], the [[Commanding General of the United States Army]] from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.{{sfn|Huntington|1957|p=230}}

Nor, unlike their European counterparts, did American generals and admirals have influence on or involvement in foreign policy; but mainly because in the frontier Army of MacArthur's youth, there was no requirement to do so. This began to change after the Spanish–American War, when American military forces started to be deployed overseas in the Pacific, Asia and the Caribbean for extended periods of time.{{sfn|Challener|1973|pp=77–80}}

The concept of the [[Theater (warfare)|theater of war]] developed during World War II. At such a senior level of command, military and political issues tended to merge. As theater commander in the Southwest Pacific, MacArthur had been accountable to the Australian government as well as his own, making him, in President Roosevelt's words to him, "an ambassador as well as Supreme Commander."{{sfn|Hasluck|1970|p=161}} MacArthur's less than wholehearted support for the "[[Europe first]]" strategy was apt to cause annoyance in Washington when the chain of command was bypassed by MacArthur through the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[John Curtin]].{{sfn|Hasluck|1970|p=161}}

General Marshall expressed this conflict in his testimony before the Senate:
{{quote|It arises from the inherent difference between the position of a commander whose mission is limited to a particular area and a particular antagonist, and the position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense and the President, who are responsible for the total security of the United States...and must weigh the interests and objectives in one part of the world with those in others to attain balance...There is nothing new in this divergence, in our military history... What is new and what brought about the necessity for General MacArthur's removal is the wholly unprecedented situation of a local Theater Commander publicly expressing his displeasure at, and his disagreement with, the foreign policy of the United States. [He]...had grown so far out of sympathy with the established policies of the United States that there is grave doubt as to whether he could any longer be permitted to exercise the authority in making decisions that normal command functions would assign to a Theater Commander.{{sfn|Long|1969|p=225}} }}

=== Powers of the President ===
In ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', [[Alexander Hamilton]] argued that: {{quote|The President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States. In this respect his authority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces, as first General and admiral of the Confederacy; while that of the British king extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies, all which, by the Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[New York Times]] | url = http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/fed/blfed69.htm | title = Federalist Papers No. 69 | date = 14 March 1788 | accessdate = 29 May 2011 |first=Alexander |last=Hamilton | authorlink = Alexander Hamilton }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

But on 26 June 1950, Truman sent the armed forces into Korea without any such Congressional mandate. The subsequent United Nations Security Council resolution authorized military assistance to South Korea,{{sfn|Fisher|1995|p=32}} but the [[United Nations Participation Act]] laid down that:
{{quote|The President shall not be deemed to require the authorization of the Congress to make available to the Security Council on its call in order to take action under article 42 of said Charter and pursuant to such special agreement or agreements the armed forces, facilities, or assistance provided for therein: Provided, That ... nothing herein contained shall be construed as an authorization to the President by the Congress to make available to the Security Council for such purpose armed forces, facilities, or assistance in addition to the forces, facilities, and assistance provided for in such special agreement or agreements.{{sfn|Fisher|1995|p=29}}}}
The Congressional inquiry triggered by MacArthur's relief ruled that Truman's actions violated both constitutional and statutory requirements.{{sfn|Fisher|1995|p=34}} While presidents had in the past used extra-legal military force, this was in "fights with pirates, landings of small naval contingents on barbarous or semi-barbarous coasts, the dispatch of small bodies of troops to chase bandits or cattle rustlers across the Mexican border, and the like."{{sfn|Fisher|1995|p=35}} Congressman [[Vito Marcantonio]], who opposed the war in Korea, argued that "when we agreed to the United Nations Charter we never agreed to supplant our Constitution with the United Nations Charter. The power to declare and make war is vested in the representatives of the people, in the Congress of the United States."{{sfn|Fisher|1995|p=35}}

Senator [[William F. Knowland]] noted that:{{quote|[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I of the Constitution]] gives the power to declare war to the Congress and not to the Executive. We are apparently now drifting into a twilight constitutional zone where the executive can put us into war, the fourth largest in our history, without a Congressional declaration or a Congressional resolution recognizing that a state of war started by others already exists. When Congress acts under its constitutional power, every statement for or against the resolution is part of the Congressional Record, and the press and the public are fully informed. The roll-call vote shows how each Member voted. This is responsible and accountable government.

If five or seven men can meet in a closed session in the Blair House or the White House, and put this nation into the fourth largest war from a casualty standpoint, in our history without their statements and recommendations being recorded or available, and without their positions on this matter being known, we have the war-making power transferred from the Congress, operating in the open, to the Executive, operating [[in camera|en camera]]. That is not, I submit, either responsible or accountable government.&lt;ref&gt;Senate Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Relations, 15 May 1951—''Military Situation in the Far East'', hearings, 82d Congress, 1st session, part 2, p. 852 (1951).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Aftermath ==

=== Responses to the relief ===
[[File:Douglas MacArthur speaking at Soldier Field HD-SN-99-03036.JPEG|thumb|right|MacArthur addresses an audience of 50,000 at [[Soldier Field]], Chicago on 25 April 1951.|alt=MacArthur at a podium with a gaggle of microphones in front of him. Men in suits and hats sit behind him.]]
The news of MacArthur's relief was greeted with shock in Japan. The [[Diet of Japan]] passed a resolution of gratitude for MacArthur, and the Emperor [[Hirohito]] visited him at the embassy in person, the first time a Japanese Emperor had ever visited a foreigner with no standing.{{sfn|James|1985|p=603}} The ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'' said:{{quote|MacArthur's dismissal is the greatest shock since the end of the war. He dealt with the Japanese people not as a conqueror but a great reformer. He was a noble political missionary. What he gave us was not material aid and democratic reform alone, but a new way of life, the freedom and dignity of the individual... We shall continue to love and trust him as one of the Americans who best understood Japan's position.{{sfn|Manchester|1978|pp=652–653}}}}

In the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] called for immediate impeachment proceedings against Truman:
{{quote|President Truman must be impeached and convicted. His hasty and vindictive removal of General MacArthur is the culmination of series of acts which have shown that he is unfit, morally and mentally, for his high office. The American nation has never been in greater danger. It is led by a fool who is surrounded by knaves.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=1008}}}}

Newspapers like the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' opined that MacArthur's "hasty and vindictive" relief was due to foreign pressure, particularly from the United Kingdom and the British socialists in Attlee's government.{{sfn|Schnabel|1972|p=365}}{{sfn|Casey|2008|p=235}} The Republican Party whip, Senator [[Kenneth S. Wherry]], charged that the relief was the result of pressure from "the Socialist Government of Great Britain."{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|pp=230–232}}

On 17 April 1951, MacArthur flew back to the United States, a country he had not seen in years. When he reached San Francisco he was greeted by the commander of the [[Sixth United States Army]], Lieutenant General [[Albert C. Wedemeyer]]. MacArthur received a parade there that was attended by 500,000 people.{{sfn|James|1985|pp=611–612}}&lt;ref name="MacArthur welcomed in S.F."&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-04-18/bay-area/17193772_1_gen-douglas-macarthur-day-korean-war-protesters-march | title = MacArthur welcomed in S.F. | date = 18 April 1951 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|page=1 | accessdate = 26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was greeted on arrival at [[Washington National Airport]] on 19 April by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and General [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV|Jonathan Wainwright]]. Truman sent Vaughan as his representative,{{sfn|James|1985|pp=611–612}} which was seen as a slight, as Vaughan was despised by the public and professional soldiers alike as a corrupt crony.{{sfn|Casey|2008|p=236}} "It was a shameful thing to fire MacArthur, and even more shameful to send Vaughan," one member of the public wrote to Truman.{{sfn|Weintraub|2000|p=2}}

MacArthur addressed a joint session of Congress where he delivered his famous "[[q:Douglas MacArthur#Farewell address to Congress (1951)|Old Soldiers Never Die]]" speech, in which he declared:{{quote|Efforts have been made to distort my position. It has been said in effect that I was a warmonger. Nothing could be further from the truth. I know war as few other men now living know it, and nothing to me—and nothing to me is more revolting. I have long advocated its complete abolition, as its very destructiveness on both friend and foe has rendered it useless as a means of settling international disputes... But once war is forced upon us, there is no other alternative than to apply every available means to bring it to a swift end. War's very object is victory, not prolonged indecision. In war there can be no substitute for victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/macarthur/sfeature/macspeech05.html | title = MacArthur's Speeches: "Old soldiers never die..." | publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service]] | accessdate = 7 June 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100501183626/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/macarthur/sfeature/macspeech05.html | archivedate = 1 May 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response, the Pentagon issued a press release noting that "the action taken by the President in relieving General MacArthur was based upon the unanimous recommendations of the President's principal civilian and military advisers including the Joint Chiefs of Staff."&lt;ref name="Pentagon Statement of Relief"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/macarthur/sfeature/officialdocs04.html | title = Pentagon Statement of Relief of Gen.

=== Congressional inquiry ===
In May and June 1951, the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] and the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] held "an inquiry into the military situation in the Far East and the facts surrounding the relief of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur."{{sfn|Wiltz|1975|p=167}} The Senate thereby attempted to avoid a constitutional crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Constitutional_Crisis_Averted.htm |publisher=[[United States Senate]] |accessdate=30 January 2014 |title=Constitutional Crisis Averted }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the sensitive political and military topics being discussed, the inquiry was held in closed session, and only a heavily censored transcript was made public until 1973.{{sfn|Wiltz|1975|p=168}} The two committees were jointly chaired by Senator [[Richard Russell, Jr.]] Fourteen witnesses were called: MacArthur, Marshall, Bradley, Collins, Vandenberg, Sherman, [[Adrian S. Fisher]], Acheson, Wedemeyer, Johnson, [[Oscar C. Badger II]], [[Patrick J. Hurley]], and [[David C. Barr]] and O'Donnell.{{sfn|Wiltz|1975|p=168}}

The testimony of Marshall and the Joint Chiefs rebutted many of MacArthur's arguments. Marshall emphatically declared that there had been no disagreement between himself, the President, and the Joint Chiefs. However, it also exposed their own timidity in dealing with MacArthur, and that they had not always kept him fully informed.{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=210}} Vandenberg questioned whether the Air Force could be effective against targets in Manchuria, while Bradley noted that the Communists were also waging limited war in Korea, having not attacked UN airbases or ports, or their own "privileged sanctuary" in Japan. Their judgment was that it was not worth it to expand the war, although they conceded that they were prepared to do so if the Communists escalated the conflict, or if no willingness to negotiate was forthcoming. They also disagreed with MacArthur's assessment of the effectiveness of the South Korean and [[Chinese Nationalist]] forces.{{sfn|Wiltz|1975|p=169}} Bradley said:
{{quote|Red China is not the powerful nation seeking to dominate the world. Frankly, in the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, this strategy would involve us in [[the wrong war, at the wrong place, at the wrong time, and with the wrong enemy]].{{sfn|Senate Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Relations|1951|p=732}}}}

The committees concluded that "the removal of General MacArthur was within the constitutional powers of the President but the circumstances were a shock to national pride."{{sfn|Senate Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Relations|1951|p=3601}} They also found that "there was no serious disagreement between General MacArthur and the Joint Chiefs of Staff as to military strategy."{{sfn|Senate Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Relations|1951|p=3602}} They recommended that "the United States should never again become involved in war without the consent of the Congress."{{sfn|Senate Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Relations|1951|p=3605}}

=== Fallout ===
Polls showed that the majority of the public still disapproved of Truman's decision to relieve MacArthur, and were more inclined to agree with MacArthur than with Bradley or Marshall.{{sfn|Casey|2008|pp=253–254}} Truman's approval rating fell to 23 percent in mid-1951, which was lower than Richard Nixon's low of 25 percent during the [[Watergate Scandal]] in 1974, and [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s of 28 percent at the height of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1968. {{As of|2011}}, it remains the lowest [[Gallup Poll]] approval rating recorded by any serving president.{{sfn|Pearlman|2008|pp=246, 326}}

The increasingly unpopular war in Korea dragged on, and the Truman administration was beset with a series of corruption scandals. He eventually decided not to run for re-election. [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], the Democratic candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential election]], attempted to distance himself from the President as much as possible.{{sfn|Casey|2008|p=327}} The election was won by the Republican candidate, General of the Army [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]],{{sfn|Casey|2008|p=336}} whose administration ramped up the pressure on the Chinese in Korea with conventional bombing and renewed threats of using nuclear weapons. Coupled with a more favorable international political climate in the wake of the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, this led the Chinese and North Koreans to agree to terms. The belief that the threat of nuclear weapons played an important part in the outcome would lead to their threatened use against China on a number of occasions during the 1950s.{{sfn|Foot|1988–1989|pp=111–112}}

As a result of their support of Truman, the Joint Chiefs became viewed as politically tainted. Senator Taft regarded Bradley in particular with suspicion, due to Bradley's focus on Europe at the expense of Asia. Taft urged Eisenhower to replace the chiefs as soon as possible. First to go was Vandenberg, who had terminal cancer and had already announced plans to retire. On 7 May 1953, Eisenhower announced that he would be replaced by General [[Nathan Twining]]. Soon after it was announced that Bradley would be replaced by Admiral [[Arthur W. Radford]], the Commander-in-Chief of the [[United States Pacific Command]], Collins would be succeeded by Ridgway, and Admiral [[William Fechteler]], who had become CNO on the death of Sherman in July 1951, by Admiral [[Robert B. Carney]].{{sfn|Watson|1998|pp=14–15}}

== Legacy ==
The relief of MacArthur cast a long shadow over American civil-military relations. When Lyndon Johnson met with General [[William Westmoreland]] in Honolulu in 1966, he told him: "General, I have a lot riding on you. I hope you don't pull a MacArthur on me."{{sfn|Danner|1993|pp=14–15}} For his part, Westmoreland and his senior colleagues were eager to avoid any hint of dissent or challenge to presidential authority. This came at a high price. In his 1998 book ''[[Dereliction of Duty (1998 book)|Dereliction of Duty: Lyndon Johnson, Robert McNamara, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Lies That Led to Vietnam]]'', then-[[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[H. R. McMaster]] argued that the Joint Chiefs failed in their duty to provide the President, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] or Congress with frank and fearless professional advice.{{sfn|Owens|1994–1995|pp=72–73}} This book was an influential one; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, General [[Hugh Shelton]], gave copies to every four-star officer in the military.{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=4–7}}

On the one hand, the relief of MacArthur established a precedent that generals and admirals could be fired for any public or private disagreement with government policy. In 1977, Major General [[John K. Singlaub]] publicly criticized proposed cuts in the size of American forces in South Korea, and was summarily relieved by President [[Jimmy Carter]] for making statements "inconsistent with announced national security policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914937,00.html | title = General on the Carpet | date = 30 May 1977 |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate = 3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Gulf War]] in 1990, Secretary of Defense [[Dick Cheney]] relieved the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General [[Michael Dugan (military)|Michael Dugan]], for showing "poor judgment at a very sensitive time" in making a series of statements to the media during a visit to Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/18/world/confrontation-gulf-air-force-chief-dismissed-for-remarks-gulf-plan-cheney-cites.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;&amp;scp=10&amp;sq=michael%20dugan&amp;st=cse | title = Confrontation in the Gulf; Air Force Chief is Dismissed for Remarks on Gulf Plan; Cheney Cites Bad Judgment |first=Eric |last=Schmitt | date = 18 September 1990 | accessdate = 4 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  General [[Stanley A.

MacArthur's relief "left a lasting current of popular sentiment that in matters of war and peace, the military really knows best," a philosophy which became known as "MacArthurism."&lt;ref name="MacArthurism"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.tampabay.com/news/perspective/an-old-soldier-is-still-in-the-fray/1044379 | date = 18 October 2009 | title = An old soldier is still in the fray | newspaper = [[St Petersburg Times]] | accessdate = 3 June 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606160748/http://www.tampabay.com/news/perspective/an-old-soldier-is-still-in-the-fray/1044379 | archivedate = 6 June 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, Lieutenant Colonel Daniel L.

In the years following, the "Legend of Petraeus" spread and expanded, as these things often do, and he was given increasing credit for the success.{{sfn|Davis|2012|p=64}} }}

During the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]], Bill Clinton used endorsements from the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral [[William J. Crowe]], and 21 other retired generals and flag officers to counter doubts about his ability to serve as Commander in Chief.&lt;ref name="MacArthurism" /&gt; This became a feature of later presidential election campaigns. During the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], twelve retired generals and admirals endorsed Senator [[John Kerry]], including former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William Crowe, and the former Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General [[Merrill McPeak|Merrill "Tony" McPeak]], who also appeared in television advertisements defending Kerry against the [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]].{{sfn|Corbett|Davidson|2009|p=58}} During this election campaign, one retired four-star General, [[Tommy Franks]], spoke at the [[Republican National Convention]] while another, [[John Shalikashvili]], addressed the [[Democratic National Convention]].{{sfn|Kohn|2011|p=29}}

In [[international politics]], '''protocol''' is the [[etiquette]] of [[diplomacy]] and [[wikt:affair|affairs]] of [[Sovereign state|state]]. It may also refer to an international agreement that supplements or amends a treaty.

A protocol is a [[wiktionary:rule|rule]] which describes how an activity should be performed, especially in the field of diplomacy. In diplomatic services and governmental fields of endeavor protocols are often unwritten guidelines. Protocols specify the proper and generally accepted behavior in matters of state and [[diplomacy]], such as showing appropriate respect to a head of state, ranking diplomats in chronological order of their accreditation at court, and so on. One definition is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Protocol''' is commonly described as a set of international courtesy rules. These well-established and time-honored rules have made it easier for nations and people to live and work together. Part of protocol has always been the acknowledgment of the hierarchical standing of all present. Protocol rules are based on the principles of civility.—Dr. P.M. Forni on behalf of the International Association of Protocol [[Consultants]] and Officers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Definitions==
There are two meanings of the word ''protocol''. In the legal sense, it is defined as an international agreement that supplements or amends a treaty. In the diplomatic sense, the term refers to the set of rules, procedures, conventions and ceremonies that relate to relations between states. In general, protocol represents the recognized and generally accepted system of international courtesy.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|protocol}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|prwto/kollon|πρωτόκολλον|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''protocol'' is derived, via French and [[Medieval Latin]], from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|πρωτόκολλον}} ''protokollon'' "first glued sheet of ''or'' onto a papyrus-roll". This comes from the act of gluing a sheet of paper to the front of a document to preserve it when it was sealed, which imparted additional authenticity to it. In the beginning, the term protocol related to the various forms of interaction observed in official correspondence between states, which were often elaborate in nature. In course of time, however, it has come to cover a much wider range of international relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|protocol}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|prwto/kollon|πρωτόκολλον|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2542">'''Radical Democratic Union''' ({{lang-tr|Radikal Demokratik Birlik}}) was a [[Turkey|Turkish]] political movement active in the 1980s. The movement was also known by names ''Radical Party'', ''Radical Greens Party'', ''Radical Democrat Green Party'' to the public. 

Radical Democratic Union was founded in 1985. The chairman of its coordination committee was İbrahim Eren who was active in the [[Workers Party of Turkey]] prior to [[1980 Turkish coup d'état]] and later at the Aegean Environmental Health Centre. The movement was inspired by the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]] and the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|German Green Party]], aiming at uniting five tendencies, namely [[environmentalist]]s, [[homosexual]]s, [[feminist]]s, [[anti-militarist]]s and [[atheist]]s. The magazine ''Yeşil Barış'' (Green Peace) published by the movement also drew considerable attention from [[sex worker]]s and [[transsexual]]s.  

The media publicised the Radical Democratic Union as a "gay party" and the pressure on the movement subsequently increased. İbrahim Eren was arrested and stabbed in prison and at work. Poet Süha Tuğtepe who acted as the theoretician of the atheist tendency left [[İstanbul]] due to serious threats from [[Islamist]] circles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radikal.com.tr/haber.php?haberno=158952 Hep otoriteye başkaldırdı]&lt;/ref&gt; The events resulted in important splits from the movement. Many environmentalist members joined the [[Greens Party (Turkey)|Greens Party]] founded in 1988 under [[Celal Ertuğ]], a former government minister. İbrahim Eren faced conflicts of view regarding the [[Turkish local elections, 1989|1989 local elections]] and left the movement, practically ending the Radical Democratic Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indigodergisi.com/kuzey_01_22.htm Ölüdoğan Bir Demokrasi Denemesi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002161438/http://www.indigodergisi.com/kuzey_01_22.htm |date=2011-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reichskommissar''' (rendered as ''Commissioner of the Empire'' or as ''Reich -'' or ''Imperial Commissioner''), in [[History of Germany|German history]], was an official [[governor|gubernatorial]] title used for various public offices during the period of the [[German Empire]] and the [[Nazi]] [[Third Reich]].

==German Empire==

===Domestic===
In the unified [[Deutsches Reich]] (after 1871), Reichskommissars were appointed to oversee special tasks. For instance, there was a Reichskommisar for [[emigration]] (''Reichskommissar für das Auswanderungswesen'') in [[Hamburg]].

Presumably the same title is rendered as "German Imperial Commissioner" in the case of [[Heligoland]] (''Helgoland'' in German), a strategic, once-Danish, island in the [[North Sea]], formally handed over to Germany by the UK on 9 August 1890 (under the [[Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty]]) and on 15 December 1890 formally annexed to Germany (after 18 February 1891 part of the Prussian province of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]): 9 August 1890 – 1891  Adolf Wermuth  (b. 1855 – d. 1927)

===Colonial===
The title of Reichskommissar was used during the [[German Empire]] for the governors of most of the ''[[Schutzgebiet]]e'' (a German term literally meaning [[protectorate]], but also applied to ordinary [[colony|colonies]]).

====In West Africa====
* in ''[[Kamerun]]'' (modern-day [[Cameroon]]) * Reichskommissare (Commissioners)
**14 July 1884 – 19 July 1884  [[Gustav Nachtigal]] (b. 1834 – d. 1885)
**19 July 1884 – 1 April 1885  [[Maximilian Buchner]] (acting) (b. 1846 – d. 1921)

**14 April 1891 – 4 June 1892  Vacant
**4 June 1892 – November 1893  Jesko von Puttkamer (2nd time); the same stayed on as the first of two ''Landeshauptleute'' ('Land captains'), till 13 August 1895; the second (18 November 1895 – 18 April 1898  [[August Köhler]], b. 1858 – d. 1902) was also the first of the Governors (since 1 January 1905 as German colony of Togoland, till the British conquered it August 1914)

**1888 – 1889  [[Franz Leopold Sonnenschein (Reichskommissar)|Franz Leopold Sonnenschein]] (b. 1857 – d. 1897); next, as it was since 14 April 1888 administratively part of the (German) [[Marshall Islands]], it had mere [[Bezirksamtleute]] (District officers; 2 October 1888 – 1906), then, being since 1 April 1906 administratively part of [[German New Guinea]], [[Stationsleiter]] ('Station Chiefs'; from 1911, subordinated to the administrators of [[Pohnpei|Ponape]] district) till 6 November 1914, finally the island was lost ([[Australia]]n administration, first by a military Commander, then under [[League of Nations mandate]])

==Nazi Germany==
The title of ''Reichskommissar'' was given by [[Adolf Hitler]] to a number of [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] governors, mainly in several [[German-occupied Europe|occupied countries]] during [[World War II]], but also before the war to reintegrate former Prussian territory regained on France, as well as various other regions inhabited by [[ethnic Germans]]. Depending on circumstances they could be severely dictatorial and repressive, most notably [[Erich Koch]] in the [[Ukraine]].

===Domestic &amp; annexed (ethnic Germans)===

====Saar Territory====
A [[plebiscite]] was held in the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]] (presently [[Saarland]]) on 13 January 1935: 90.3% of those voting wished to join [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] rather than join [[France]]. [[Josef Bürckel]] (b. 1895 – d. 1944) was appointed on 1 March 1935 as ''Reichskommissar für die Rückgliederung des [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saarlandes]]'', then changed his style from 17 June 1936 to ''Reichskommissar für das Saarland'', and from 8 April 1940 to ''Reichskommissar für die [[Gau Saarpfalz|Saarpfalz]]''; finally from 11 March 1941, he was made ''[[Reichsstatthalter]] in der "[[Gau Westmark|Westmark]]"'' (the region's new name, meaning "Western [[Marches|March]] or Border"), till 28 September 1944 when he was succeeded by [[Willi Stöhr]] (b. 1903, also NSDAP), who remained in office until 21 March 1945.

====Sudetenland====
After the [[Sudetenland]] region of [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was annexed by Germany on 1 October 1938, it was under a Military governor ([[Wilhelm Keitel]]; 1 October  1938 – 20 October 1938), until [[Konrad Henlein]] was appointed Reichskommissar of the territories on 21 October 1938. On 1 May 1939 a regular 'domestic' ''[[Reichsgau]]'' Sudetenland was created; Henlein stayed on as [[Reichsstatthalter]] until the region was re-incorporated into [[Czechoslovakia]] on 4 May 1945.

====Vienna====

====Norway====
{{Main|Reichskommissariat Norwegen}}
After the Norwegian king and his government fled during the [[Operation Weserübung|German invasion of the country]] and the failure of a [[coup-d'état]] by the fascist politician [[Vidkun Quisling]], Hitler appointed a ''Reichskommissar für die besetzten Norwegischen Gebiete'' (Reich Commissioner for the occupied Norwegian territories) on 24 April 1940. The office had two consecutive Reichskommissars with extensive authority:
*24 April 1940 – 7 May 1945 – [[Josef Terboven]] (b. 1898 – d. 1945), NSDAP. He took up residence in the Crown Prince's manor at [[Skaugum]]. Answerable only to Hitler, Terboven initially tried to negotiate with the Norwegian [[Storting]] to establish a civilian administration which would be willing to sign a peace treaty with Germany. After the collapse of these negotiations, Terboven on 25 September 1940 proclaimed the deposition of King [[Haakon VII]] and his [[Government-in-exile|cabinet-in-exile]] and outlawed all political parties except the Norwegian fascist party [[Nasjonal Samling]]. Terboven committed suicide during the night of 7 May 1945, just before the surrender of the German forces in Norway became effective.
*7 May 1945 – 8 May 1945 – [[Franz Böhme]], commander-in-chief of German military forces in Norway (b. 1885 – d. 1947), assumed Terboven's responsibilities as acting Reichskommissar until Allied forces took control and had him arrested.

====Netherlands====
{{Main|Reichskommissariat Niederlande}}
After the [[Battle of the Netherlands|German invasion of the country]], the Dutch government and crown went in exile in London and the [[Netherlands]] was placed under the command of two successive military governors:
*10 May 1940 – 20 May 1940 – [[Fedor von Bock]] (b. 1880 – d. 1945)
*20 May 1940 – 29 May 1940 – [[Alexander von Falkenhausen]] (b. 1878 – d. 1966)
There was one ''Reichskommissar für die besetzten niederländischen Gebiete'' (Reich Commissioner for the occupied Dutch territories):
*29 May 1940 – 5 May 1945 – [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] (b. 1892 – d. 1946), NSDAP

====Belgium and Northern France====
[[Belgium]] was initially placed under a ''[[Military Administration (Nazi Germany)|Militärverwaltung]]'', headed by military governors. The country was joined administratively to "North France", i.e. the adjacent French [[Departments of France|départements]] ''[[Nord (French department)|Nord]]'' and ''[[Pas-de-Calais]]''. This was done both for security reasons, as the area was to be used as a staging ground in [[Operation Sea Lion|an expected invasion of Britain]], as well as to "[[Irredentism|re-claim]]" [[French Flanders]] as a historic part of Germanic [[Flanders]]. The [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France]] had two successive governors:
*10 May 1940 – 1 June 1940 – [[Karl Rudolf Gerd von Rundstedt]] (b. 1875 – d. 1953) and [[Fedor von Bock]] (b. 1880 – d. 1945)
*1 June 1940 – 18 July 1944 – [[Alexander Freiherr von Falkenhausen]] (b. 1878 – d. 1966)

This situation continued until July 1944, when a ''Reichskommissar für Belgien-Nordfrankreich'' was appointed: 
*18 July 1944 – January 1945 – [[Joseph Grohé]] (b. 1902 – d. 1988) NSDAP

In December 1944, when the allies had already liberated virtually all of Belgium, its territory was split up into three ''Gau''-type entities as integral ("Germanic") parts of the Reich: the bi-cultural Belgian capital [[Brussels]] (''Brüssel'' in German, ''Brussel'' in Dutch and ''Bruxelles'' in French) remained directly under the German ''Reichskommissar'' as a [[District of Brussels|Brussels District]], but the bulk of the country was divided ethno-linguistically and placed under collaborating Belgian fascist party leaders (on paper) as [[Gauleiter]]s and with [[Führer]]-imitating titles in their national languages:

Gauleiter of ''[[Reichsgau Flandern]]'' ([[Flanders]], ''Vlaanderen'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]; supposedly including [[French Flanders]] in North France) and National leader of the Flemish People (''Landsleider van het Vlaamsche Volk'') as well as "Head of the Flemish Liberation Committee" (''Hoofd van het Vlaamsche Bevrijdingscomité''):
*15 December 1944 – 1945 – [[Jef Van de Wiele]] (b. 1902 – d. 1979) (in Germany in exile; head of the [[Devlag]] party)

Gauleiter of ''[[Reichsgau Wallonien]]'' ([[Wallonia]], ''Wallonie'' in [[French language|French]]) and Leader of the Walloon People (''Chef du Peuple Wallon''):
*8 December 1944 – 1945 – [[Léon Degrelle]] (b. 1906 – d. 1994) (also remained in Germany in exile, even though German troops [[Battle of the Bulge|reconquered part of Wallonia]] in December 1944 – January 1945); head of the [[Rexist Party]])

===Soviet territories===
Before the beginning of [[Operation Barbarossa]] (the eastern front campaign against the [[Soviet Union]]) on 22 June 1941, the Nazi ideologist [[Alfred Rosenberg]] suggested the administrative division of conquered Soviet territory in the following ''Reichskommissariate'', only the first two of which would become reality through military success: 
*''[[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]]'' (the [[Baltic countries]], [[Belarus]], and adjacent parts of [[Western Russia]]);
*''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Ukraine]]'' (the [[Ukraine]] and the northern parts of [[Southern Federal District|Southern Russia]]);
*''[[Reichskommissariat Kaukasus|Kaukasus]]'' (the [[Caucasus]] and the southern parts of Southern Russia);
*''[[Reichskommissariat Moskowien|Moskowien]]'' ([[Moscow]] metropolitan area and the rest of nearest Russian European areas);
*''[[Reichskommissariat Turkestan|Turkestan]]'' (the [[Central Asia]]n Soviet republics, ethnically mainly [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]).

This suggested an intention to destroy [[Russia]] as a political entity, as the Nazis organised the areas adjacent to [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]]'s eastern provinces in accordance with the [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] ''[[Lebensraum]]'' idea (''[[Drang nach Osten]]''), to benefit future "[[Aryan race|Aryan]]" generations. When [[Germany|German]] forces entered Soviet territory, they immediately implemented this administrative plan instating the Reichskommissariat of "Ostland" in the Baltic lands and "Ukraine" in the Ukraine, headed by [[Hinrich Lohse]] and [[Erich Koch]] respectively. These administrators put in practice the intended measures during the whole of their administrative period, until 1943–44, when the Germans after the [[Battle of Kursk]] were gradually driven out by force.

====Ostland====
{{Main|Reichskommissariat Ostland}}
On 17 July 1941, the Reichskommissariat Ostland ("Eastland") was established, soon uniting German-occupied [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] (from 1 September 1941) and [[Estonia]] (from 5 December 1941) and [[Belarus]]. Ostland was organized into four General Districts (''Generalbezirke''); only the (Latvian) capital city of [[Riga]] (''Gebiet Riga Stadt'') was directly administered by the ''Reichskommissar für das Ostland''. The incumbents were: 
*17 July 1941 – 26 September 1944 – [[Hinrich Lohse]] (b. 1896 – d. 1964), NSDAP
*26 September 1944 – 2 February 1945 – Erich Koch (b. 1896 – d. 1986), NSDAP (de facto ousted on 13 October 1944 when the Soviet [[Red Army]] took Riga, although Ostland wasn't officially dissolved until 2 February 1945)

====Ukraine====
{{Main|Reichskommissariat Ukraine}}
The territory in [[Ukraine]] occupied by Germany since 25 June 1941 initially fell under a military governor: 
*25 June 1941 – 31 August 1941 – Karl Rudolf Gerd von Rundstedt (b. 1875 – d. 1953)

The Reichskommissariat Ukraine was established on 20 August 1941, under a ''Reichskommissar für die Ukraine''. The incumbents were:
*20 August 1941 – 6 October 1943 – [[Erich Koch]] (b. 1896 – d. 1986), NSDAP
*1942 – 30 September 1943 – Paul Dargel (acting for Koch) (b. 1903 – d. 19..), NSDAP
*October 1943 – 1944 – [[Curt von Gottberg]] (b. 1896 – d. 1945), NSDAP

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5651">'''Richard Benjamin Moore''' (9 August 1893 &amp;ndash; 1978) was a [[Barbados]]-born [[wikt:Afro-Caribbean|African-Caribbean]] [[civil rights]] activist and prominent [[Socialist]]. He was also one of the earlier advocates of the term [[African American]] as opposed to [[Negro]], or "black".&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Moore, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3jPFh_vj3GAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Name "Negro": Its Origin and Evil Use''] (1960), Baltimore, MD: Black Classic Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early years===

Richard Benjamin Moore was a Barbadian writer born on 9 August 1893 in [[Barbados]], [[West Indies]], to Richard Henry Moore and Josephine Thorne Moore. In Barbados, the Richard Henry and Josephine Moore family was considered middle-class in terms of socioeconomic status. Richard Henry Moore was the moneymaker of the family, working as a [[preacher]] and building contractor in Barbados. Unfortunately, tragedy struck when Richard B. Moore’s mother died when he was three years old. Moore’s father later remarried, to Elizabeth Mclean. Soon thereafter, Moore’s father died in 1902 when young Richard was aged nine. With both biological parents dead, Moore was raised by his stepmother Elizabeth Mclean.

Mclean wanted to carry out Richard senior’s wishes of giving young Richard the best education. It is for this reason that Mclean aided young Richard in traveling to the [[United States]]. In hopes of furthering his education, Moore migrated to The United States of America and arrived in [[New York City]] on 4 July 1909. However, Moore would not become a naturalised citizen until 11 September 1924. Although African Americans were free in the United States, they were far from being treated equal to [[European-Americans]] in America. Moore was immediately faced with [[ethnic discrimination]] when it came to employment and educational opportunities among other things. Although trained in Barbados to do clerical work, he was forced to turn to the more unfavourable jobs such as elevator operator and work in a silk manufacturing firm.

===Political activism===

Due to the struggles that Moore encountered and observed, he became a strong vocalist for the rights of African Americans. In 1919 he joined the [[African Blood Brotherhood]] (ABB), which was an organization formed to defend African Americans from [[race riots]] and [[lynching]]. Moore, along with other African-American advocates, joined the [[Socialist Party]] in the early 1920s. Moore joined the Socialist Party, in part, because at the time the Socialist party was transforming itself into a force to fight against segregation.

Moore was a frequent political candidate of the Socialist Party. In 1928 he ran for [[U.S. Congress]] in New York's 21st Congressional District.&lt;ref&gt;"Red Ticket Goes on Ballot in NY State", ''Daily Worker,'' vol. 5, no. 241 (11 October 1928), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New York state election, 1934|1934]], Moore ran on the Socialist ticket for [[Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals]]. In 1935, he became the organiser for the [[International Labor Defense]] in the [[New England]] Territory. He used his position in this organisation to speak on behalf the [[Scottsboro Boys]], a case in which nine young African-American males were accused of raping two young European-American women. 

In 1942, Moore was expelled from the Socialist Party because he was accused of being an [[Black nationalism|African-American nationalist]]; keeping African-American issues on the front burner.

He continued his efforts for [[Civil rights|equal rights]] in America. He also played a leading role in [[Caribbean]] advocacy groups. Moore, like his friend [[Hubert Harrison]], was a bibliophile, collecting over 15,000 books and pamphlets on the African-American experiences worldwide. This collection of books is currently housed in a library that Moore developed in Barbados. Moore also ran the [[Frederick Douglass]] Book Center in Harlem. 

Moore wrote a few books himself, including ''The Name Negro, Its Origin and Evil Use'' (1960) and ''Caribs, Cannibals and Human Relations'' (1972). He also had essays and articles published in various magazines and journals including the ''Negro Champion'', ''Daily Worker'', and ''Freedomways''.

===Death and legacy===

Richard Benjamin Moore died in his homeland of Barbados in 1978 at the age of 85.

'''Philip Jaisohn''' (January 7, 1864 – January 5, 1951) was the anglicized name used by '''Soh Jaipil''' ({{korean|labels=no|서재필|{{linktext|徐|載|弼}}}}), a noted champion for Korea's [[Korean independence movement|independence]], journalist, the first Korean to become a naturalized citizen of the [[United States]], and the founder of the first [[Korea]]n newspaper in [[Hangul]], the [[Tongnip Sinmun|Independent News]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.segye.com/Articles/NEWS/SOCIETY/Article.asp?aid=20110407005238&amp;subctg1=&amp;subctg2= 서재필 박사 60주기 추모제, 8일 보성 기념공원서 열려] The Segyenews 2011.04.07 {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the organizers of the [[Gapsin Coup]] in 1884 as well as the 1896 to 1898 civil rights movement and other [[suffrage]] movements. However, when the [[Gapsin Coup]] failed, he took refuge in the United States, where he became a medical doctor. During his time in the United States he became the first Korean to gain [[United States|American]] citizenship. From 1895 to 1898 he returned to [[Korea]] as chief adviser to the [[Joseon dynasty]] government and returned from 1945 to 1948 as chief adviser to the American occupation forces in the south. His nicknames were Songjae ({{korean|labels=no|송재|松齋}}) and Ssang-gyeong ({{korean|labels=no|쌍경|雙慶}}), his [[courtesy name]] was '''Yun-gyeong''' ({{korean|labels=no|윤경|允卿}}) and he wrote under the [[pen name]] '''N.H. Osia'''.

== Life ==

=== Early years ===
Soh Jaipil was born in [[Boseong County]], [[Joseon|Korea]]. His family was one of the [[Joseon Dynasty]]'s noble families. He was the second son of a Soh Kwang-hyo (also known as Soh Kwang-ha), who was a local magistrate in [[Boseong County]]. He was raised by one of his relatives in [[Seoul]]. At eight years of age, he was adopted by Soh Kwang-ha, the second cousin of his biological father Soh Kwang-hyo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?cid=1593&amp;docId=574510&amp;mobile&amp;categoryId=1593 Soh Jaipil] {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soh's family was from the upper echelons of Joseon Society. He was the eight generation descendant of [[Seo Jong-je]], a daughter to [[Queen Jeongseong]]. She was the wife to the 21st King [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]]. [[Seo Kwang-bum]], who shared similar ideological beliefs was also from his family.

During his adolescence Soh studied at [[Kim Seong-geun]] and [[Park Kyu-su]]'s private school. When Soh was a teenager, he had already been exposed to the reformist ideals of [[Kim Ok-gyun]].

===Political activist===
{{Main|Gapsin Coup}}
He passed the [[Gwageo|civil service exam]] at the age of 18, becoming one of the youngest people to ever pass this exam. As a result, he became a junior officer in 1882. Thereafter he was appointed to Gyoseokwan Bujeongja ({{korean|labels=no|교서관 부정자|校書館 副正字}}) and Seungmunwon Gajuseo ({{korean|labels=no|승문원 가주서|承文院假主書}}). In 1883 he was appointed to Seungmunwon Bujeongja ({{korean|labels=no|승문원 부정자|承文院 副正字}}) and Hunryunwon Bubongsa ({{korean|labels=no|훈련원 부봉사|訓鍊院 副奉事}}). In the following year, he was sent to Japan where he studied both at the Keio Gijuku (the forerunner of the [[Keio University]]) and the [[Toyama Army Academy]]. In July 1884, his adoptive mother  died, but he quickly returned to public service under special orders.

In his reports to the king, Soh explained that in the new world Korea's armed forces were useless and obsolete. This annoyed powerful conservatives, but it made Soh widely known and respected among like-minded young intellectuals. By that time, a small but growing number of young intellectuals understood that fundamental reform had to occur or Korea would fall victim to the imperialist powers.&lt;ref name="tistir"&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/07/363_101797.html (20) Seo Jae-pil: pioneering reformer, independence fighter] koreatimes 2011.12.28 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he was appointed to Joryeon-guk Sagwanjang ({{korean|labels=no|조련국 사관장|操鍊局 士官長}}).

In December 1884, Soh, following [[Kim Ok-gyun]], was involved in the [[Gapsin Coup]], a radical attempt to overturn the old regime and establish equality among people. Soh and [[Kim Ok-gyun]], [[Park Yeong-hyo]], [[Yun Chi-ho]], [[Hong Yeong-shik]], and others had planned a coup for seven months, from July to December 1884. He was appointed the Vice-Minister of Defense. The coup was defeated in three days, as China intervened by sending military troops. As a result, his two younger brothers were killed and his biological father Soh Kwang-ha and biological mother Lady Lee of Seongju were executed under a guilt-by-association system. His first wife Lady Kim was sold into slavery, but committed suicide. Convicted of treason, Soh Jaipil lost his whole family and had to flee Korea to save his life.

The majority of the 1884 revolutionaries fled to Japan. Unlike them, Soh moved to the United States. He saw Japan as essentially a conduit for Western knowledge and ideas, but preferred to deal with what he saw as the source itself.&lt;ref name="tistir"/&gt;

===Exile in the United States===
[[File:Philip Jaisohn's Graduation from Columbia Medical College 1892.jpg|thumb|196x196px|Graduation from Columbia Medical College (1892)]][[File:Philip Jaisohn and Muriel Armstrong in 1930's.jpg|thumb|right|269x269px|Philip Jaisohn and Muriel Armstrong, 1930s]]

In 1885, early in his stay in America Soh worked part-time jobs. In 1886, Soh lived in [[Norristown, Pennsylvania]], and attended the Harry Hillman Academy (Wilkes-Barre, PA) thanks to the help of John Welles Hollenback. He began to use the name "Philip Jaisohn" at that time. In 1890, he became the first Korean immigrant to acquire United States citizenship. He studied medicine at Columbia Medical College (now [[George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences]]), and was the first Korean to receive an American medical degree in 1892.{{r|fnd|kt|LFT}}

In 1890, he became a U.S. citizen and from then he was often referred to by his American name Philip Jaisohn.

In 1894, he married Muriel Armstrong, a distant relative of the former president of the United States, [[James Buchanan]], and daughter of [[George B. Armstrong]], credited as the founder of the U.S. [[Railway Mail Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postalmuseum.si.edu/rms/history/1864-1875.html|title=A Fast Start, 1864–1875|publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two daughters, Stephanie and Muriel. In 1895, he was pardoned by the Joseon government, but he flatly refused to return.

===The Independent===
[[Image:독립신문 1897.04.07 금요일자.gif|274x274px|thumb|right|''The Independent'']][[File:Seo Jp &amp; Muriel Jaisohn &amp; Kim Ks.jpg|thumb|198x198px|Soh Jaipil and his daughter Muriel, [[Kim Kyu-sik]], in [[Incheon]](1947)]]{{Main|Tongnip Sinmun}}
In 1894, [[Japan]] defeated China in the [[First Sino-Japanese war]] which occurred on the [[Korean Peninsula]]. The Korean cabinet was filled with reformists. Along with these political changes, the treason of the [[Gapsin Coup]] was pardoned enabling Jaisohn's return in 1895. In December 1895, he went to [[Incheon]]. The Joseon government wanted to appoint him to Foreign Secretary but he refused to take the position. In Korea, he endeavored to politically educate people. Jaisohn published a newspaper, ''The Independent'' (독립신문), to transform the Korean population into an informed citizenry. He was the first to print his newspaper entirely in Hangul to extend readership to lower classes and women.

===Sowing the ideals of independence and democracy===
[[File:Independence Gate in 1897.jpg|thumb|198x198px|[[Independence Gate]]]]
{{Main|Independence Club|Independence Gate}}
In the 1896 to 1898 Civil rights movement and suffrage movements. Soh's goal was to ensure that Korea would drift away from the Chinese sphere of influence but without falling too heavily under the influence of Russia or Japan. He was also behind the construction of the Independence Gate, which was initially meant to symbolize the end of Korea's ritual subordination to China.&lt;ref name="tistir"/&gt;  Apart from his journalistic and political activities, he delivered regular lectures on modern politics and the principles of [[democracy]].&lt;ref name="tistir"/&gt;

He promoted national independence as the principal political ideal and emphasized neutral diplomatic approaches to protect Korea from China, Russia and Japan. He also underscored the importance of public education, modernized industry and public hygiene. The Independence was particularly critical of misconduct by government officials, which caused strong reactions by the conservatives. Under the aegis of the [[Independence Club]] ({{korean|labels=no|독립협회|獨立協會}}), Jaisohn organized the All People's Congress, an open public forum to debate over political issues. The Congress was hailed by young reformers and began to establish nationwide chapters.

In November 1897, Soh enabled the construction of the [[Independence Gate]] (독립문;獨立門).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imaeil.com/sub_news/sub_news_view.php?news_id=50661&amp;yy=2007 역사속의 오늘-독립문 완공] imail 2007.11.20 {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time he also ended the policy of [[Yeongeunmun]] (영은문;迎恩門).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/culture/201005/h2010051721354086330.htm 독립문에 대한 오해와 진실] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920235952/http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/culture/201005/h2010051721354086330.htm |date=2012-09-20 }} The Hanguk Ilbo {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeongeunmun  was the [[Korea]]n policy of welcoming the Chinese envoys, Yeongeun roughly translates from Korean to English as "Welcome to beneficent Envoys of suzerain's."

In 1898, conservatives accused Jaisohn and the Club of seeking to replace the monarchy with a republic, and the Korean government requested Jaisohn to return to the US. After his return, the Korean government ordered the Club to disband and arrested 17 leaders including [[Rhee Syngman]].

=== Clerk and Company manage ===
In April to August 1898, he accompanied an army to the [[Spanish–American War]]. In 1899 he found employment as clerk for the [[University of Pennsylvania Hospital]].

In 1904, worked with Harold Deemer, who was a year younger, to create the "Deemer and Jaisohn shop". It was a stationery and printing industry store. In 1915, the shop became called the Philip Jaisohn Company, and specialized in the printing industry.

=== Independence movements ===
In the [[United States]], Jaisohn conducted medical research at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and later became a successful printer in [[Philadelphia]]. When he heard the news of the [[March 1st Movement]] (1919), a nationwide protest against Japanese rule in Korea, Jaisohn convened the "First Korean Congress", which was held in Philadelphia for three days. After the Congress, Jaisohn devoted his energies and private property to the freedom of Korea. He organized the League of Friends of Korea in 26 cities with the help of Rev. [[Floyd Tomkins]], and established the "Korean Information Bureau." He published a political journal "Korea Review" to inform the [[United States|American]] public of the situation in Korea, and to persuade the [[U.S. government]] to support the freedom for [[Koreans]].

In the 1920s, Soh, who had just turned 60, returned to research and spent his 60s and 70s working as a specialist doctor and micro-biologist, as well as occasionally publishing in peer-review academic journals.&lt;ref name="tistir"/&gt;

Five years later in 1924, Jaisohn went legally bankrupt due to his political engagement and had to resume practicing medicine to make a living. At age 62, he became a student again at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to renew his medical knowledge. After this, he published five research articles in the medical journals specializing in pathology. During World War II, he volunteered as a physical examination officer with the belief that the victory of the U.S. would bring freedom to Korea.

===Last days in Korea===

Jaisohn returned to Korea once again after [[surrender of Japan|Japan's defeat]] in [[World War II]]. The [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|U.S. Army Military Government]] in control of the southern part of Korea invited him to serve as chief adviser. In December 1946, he was elected to the Interim Legislative Assembly ({{korean|labels=no|남조선과도입법의원|南朝鮮過渡立法議院}}). In May 1945, liberal and moderate socialist intellectuals selected him as candidate for presidency, but he declined. When the date of the first presidential election was confirmed by the [[United Nations]], Jaisohn was petitioned to run for presidency by 3,000 people including a young [[Kim Dae-jung]], but he refused in the end.

Jaisohn felt that political unity was needed for a new nation despite his uneasy relationship with the president elect [[Syngman Rhee]]. He decided to return to the United States in 1948. Suffering a [[heart attack]] a week earlier on December 29, Jaisohn died on January 5, 1951 during the Korean War, just two days before his 87th birthday.

His body was cremated, and his ashes were buried in [[Bib church]] in [[Philadelphia]]. In 1994 his remains were repatriated to [[South Korea]]. His ashes were buried in the [[National Cemetery of South Korea]] in [[Seoul]].

==Philip Jaisohn Memorial House==
[[File:Jaisohn House Media.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Philip Jaisohn Memorial House]]
The Philip Jaisohn Memorial House in [[Media, Pennsylvania]] was Dr. Jaisohn's home from 1925 to 1951. This house was bought when Dr. Jaisohn was in great financial difficulties, while his house in Philadelphia was pledged due to his devotion to the Korean independence. His Media home was acquired by the Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation in 1987 and opened to the public in 1990. Since then, the Jaisohn House has been visited by many students and politicians from Korea such as former [[President of South Korea|South Korean president]] and Nobel peace laureate [[Kim Dae-jung]] as well as Korean American immigrants and community neighbors.

On May 21, 1994, the [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]] and the Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation dedicated a [[List of Pennsylvania state historical markers in Delaware County|historical marker]] for Dr. Jaisohn, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;American-educated medical doctor who sowed seeds of democracy in Korea, published its first modern newspaper (1896-98), and popularized its written language. The first Korean to earn a Western medical degree and become a U.S. citizen. He worked for Korean independence during the Japanese occupation, 1910-45. Chief Advisor to the U.S. Military Government in Korea, 1947-1948. This was his home for 25 years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a [[hierarchy]] or [[tree structure]] of any kind, a '''superior''' is an individual or position at a higher level in the hierarchy than another (a "subordinate" or "inferior"), and thus closer to the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]]. In [[business]], superiors are people who are [[supervisor]]s and in the [[military]], superiors are people who are higher in the [[chain of command]] ([[superior officer]]). Superiors are given, sometimes supreme, authority over others under their command. When an order is given, one must follow that order and obey it or punishment may be issued.

==Catholic Church==
{{furtherinformation|Hierarchy of the Catholic Church}}
A {{vanchor|religious superior}} is the person to whom a [[cleric]] is immediately responsible under [[canon law]]. For [[monk]]s, it would be the [[abbot]] (or the [[abbess]] for [[nun]]s); for [[friar]]s, it would be the [[prior]], or, for [[Franciscans]], the guardian (''[[custos (Franciscans)|custos]]''), for [[Minim (religious order)|Minims]], the [[corrector]]; for [[Diocese|diocesan]] priests, it would be the local [[bishop]]. In religious orders with a hierarchy above the local community, there will also be [[superiors general]] and possibly [[provincial superior]]s above the local abbot, prior, or [[abbess|mother superior]]. The priest in charge a [[mission sui iuris|mission ''sui iuris'']] is called an [[ecclesiastical superior]].

Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction:Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR-TUP) project was initiated by [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]], a [[Bangladesh]]-based development organisation in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Rakib Avi |author2=Anika Noor |date=20 September 2015 |title=Hope Is The Word |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/op-ed/hope-the-word-145702 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultra poor are a group of people who eat below 80% of their energy requirements despite spending at least 80% of income on food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1759-5436.1986.mp17003002.x/abstract |title=Seasonality and Ultrapoverty – Lipton – 2009 – IDS Bulletin – Wiley Online Library |date=22 May 2009 |accessdate=21 September 2015 |doi=10.1111/j.1759-5436.1986.mp17003002.x |volume=17 |journal=IDS Bulletin |pages=4–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bangladesh, they constitute the poorest 17.5 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey, 2010, Bureau of Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; These people suffer from chronic hunger and malnutrition, have inadequate shelter, are more prone to disease, deprived of education and more vulnerable to recurring natural disasters.The CFPR-TUP programme is aimed at households which are too poor to access the benefits from development interventions such as microfinance and assists them to access mainstream development services. The program costs around 35 million USD a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expense Revenue 2015|url=http://www.brac.net/partnership|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graduation process==
The graduation approach is a two year program aimed at lifting the ultra poor into a better economic and social condition. It starts with the allocation of an asset such as cattle or poultry, as well as training on how to raise them. It also includes food or cash support alongside, partly to reduce the need to eat or sell the asset in a financial crisis. There's a [[savings account]], health education and regular coaching to reinforce skills and build confidence.&lt;ref name="hope"/&gt;The indicators are positive changes in food security, diversified income sources, asset ownership, improved housing, school enrolment and social acceptance. After completion of the two-year grant phase, the ultra poor members participate in BRAC’s mainstream development programmes. 

A study released in 2010 reported that more than 95% of participants left the category of ultra-poverty over the 24 months, and stayed out of it four years later. A randomised control trial released in 2013 showed sustained shifts in value of livestock, self-employment, earnings and self-reported happiness – long after the period of support had ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Scott MacMillan |date=12 January 2015 |title=The ultra-poor: a pioneering technique is helping the hardest to reach |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jan/12/ultra-poor-pioneering-work-results-bangladesh |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since its inception the program has covered 1.6&amp;nbsp;million ultra poor households in 44 districts of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pioneer in Change  |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/the-star/spotlight/pioneer-change-71174 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Bangladesh, Consultative Group for Assisting Poor (CGAP), a [[World Bank]] organisation, and the [[Ford Foundation]] have studied the TUP program, adapted in eight countries in Latin America, Africa, [[the Middle East]] and elsewhere in Asia, explicitly modelled on BRAC's. After 1.5 to 3 years, 75% to 98% of participants meet "graduation" criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Heather Grady |url=https://www.academia.edu/7005718/Tackling_Ultra-Poverty_Through_the_Graduation_Approach |title=Tackling Ultra-Poverty Through the Graduation Approach &amp;#124; Heather Grady |publisher=Academia.edu |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poverty-action.org/ultrapoor |title=Ultra Poor Graduation Pilots &amp;#124; Innovations for Poverty Action |publisher=Poverty-action.org |date= |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Kristof]] mentioned in a ''[[New York Times]]'' column that this model is the mechanism of hope that helps people make headway out of poverty.&lt;ref name="hope"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/21/opinion/nicholas-kristof-the-power-of-hope-is-real.html |title=The Power of Hope Is Real|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; BRAC is ready to open-source their approach, both to help other countries achieve similar results and also to refine their own methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nextbillion.net/blogpost.aspx?blogid=1847 |title=Targeting the Ultra Poor: When Microcredit Isn't the First Step |publisher=NextBillion.net |date=26 June 2010 |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Participatory Wealth ranking ===
The first step is targeting or finding the people who needs help the most. This is done through what BRAC calls "participatory wealth ranking" – gathering about 40 to 50 people in the village or community to determine the poorest. Program staff follow up with in-person visits to potential participants, using a set of standard criteria – number of meals a day, whether their roof is thatched or tin, and so on – to determine who qualifies. Senior managers then verify the selection. It's a mix of bottom-up participatory involvement and top-down supervision, intended to ensure that no ultra-poor are left out, and funds are not wasted on those who could benefit from a less costly intervention.

=== Asset grants, training and follow-ups ===
The next step is transfer of assets such as a goat, [[chickens]] or a cow, a cash and food [[stipend]] to give the beneficiary breathing room while learning a new trade or access a savings account. Training in basic literacy and numeracy like writing their names and basic preventative and curative healthcare takes place alongside. Others in the community, including village elites, are brought into the process. Coaching or "hand-holding", in the form of weekly visits from program staff to overcome challenges, is essential in the approach.

=== Graduation ===
Continuing to save after the end of the program can help beneficiaries/participants protect assets and accumulate money for future investments or emergencies. A shared goal across the pilots was that by the end of the program, members had access to a wide range of financial services. The Graduation Approach is not a short-term escape from extreme poverty but instead seeks to equip participants with the tools, livelihoods, and self-confidence to sustain themselves when the program is over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ids.ac.uk/files/dmfile/GraduationConference2014-Abstractsacceptedv527-apr-14.pdf#page=4 |format=PDF|page=4|title=An end in sight for ultra poverty-scaling up BRAC's graduation model for the poorest|publisher=Graduation and Social Protection Conference – Institute of Development Studies (IDS), UK|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Occupy Handbook''''' is a collection of essays about [[Occupy Wall Street]] the larger international [[Occupy movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/12/occupy-handbook_n_1420962.html Huffington Post: Occupy Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt; Contributors include economists and political commentators such as: [[Paul Krugman]], [[Robin Wells (economist)|Robin Wells]], [[Michael Lewis]], [[Robert Reich]], [[Amy Goodman]], [[David Graeber]], [[Peter Diamond]], [[Emmanuel Saez]], [[Ariel Dorfman]], [[Barbara Ehrenreich]], [[Jeff Sachs]], and [[Nouriel Roubini]], among others. The essays analyze the movement's origins and questions about the role of the movement in contemporary society. The book attempts to capture the Occupy Wall Street phenomenon, giving readers an on-the-scene feel for the movement, as well as considering the lasting changes wrought and recommending reform. The editor of ''The Occupy Handbook'', Janet Byrne, has previously written of the Occupy movement for the [[Huffington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/janet-byrne/occupy-movement_b_1464717.html 9 Moments In The Occupy Movement History] Janet Byrne, [[Huffington Post]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the [[The New Yorker|New Yorker magazine]], John Cassidy writes, "I thoroughly recommend 'The Occupy Handbook'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/johncassidy/2012/04/occupy-washington-a-new-handbook-inspired-by-ows.html How to Occupy Washington] John Cassidy, [[The New Yorker|The New Yorker magazine]]&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkus Reviews describes it as "A succinct body of essays by knowledgeable, sympathetic observers on the grievances of the Occupy Wall Street protestors."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/janet-byrne/occupy-handbook/#review Kirkus Reviews: Occupy Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt; John Gapper of the [[Financial Times]] calls it, "A rewarding collection of essays on the meaning of Occupy Wall Street concentrates its ire on the US political system".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e505033c-a02f-11e1-88e6-00144feabdc0.html The rootless existence of the one per cent] by John Gapper, [[Financial Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20806">'''Cyber-diplomacy''' is the evolution of [[public diplomacy]] to include and use the new platforms of communication in the 21st century.  As explained by Jan Melissen in ''The New Public Diplomacy: Soft Power in International Relations'', cyber-diplomacy “links the impact of innovations in communication and information technology to diplomacy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Melissen|first=Jan|title=The New Public Diplomacy: Soft Power in International Relations|year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=1403945160|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber-diplomacy is also known as or is part of [[public diplomacy 2.0]], [[EDiplomacy]], and [[virtual diplomacy]].  Cyber-diplomacy has as its underpinnings that, “it recognizes that new communication technologies offer new opportunities to interact with a wider public by adopting a network approach and making the most of an increasingly multicentric global, interdependent system.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Melissen|first=Jan|title=The New Public Diplomacy: Soft Power in International Relations|year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=1403945160|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:21st-Century-Statecraft www.savevid.com .theora.ogv|thumb|Secretary of State Hillary Clinton discusses 21st Century Statecraft.]]
U.S. cyber-diplomacy is led by the [[United States Department of State]] and is a new tool in fulfilling the U.S. public diplomacy mission.  As stated by [[Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs]], the mission of American public diplomacy “is to support the achievement of U.S. foreign policy goals and objectives, advance national interests, and enhance national security by informing and influencing foreign publics and by expanding and strengthening the relationship between the people and government of the [[United States]] and citizens of the rest of the world.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs|url=https://www.state.gov/r/|publisher=The Office off Electronic Information, Bureau of Public Affairs|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the [[United States]] had engaged in cyber-diplomacy under President [[George W. Bush]] in 2006, the United States officially launched its cyber-diplomacy campaign in 2009. The development of cyber-diplomacy by the United States is a response to the shifts in international relations by extending the reach of U.S. diplomacy beyond government-to-government communications.  The U.S. is adapting its statecraft by reshaping its diplomatic agendas to meet old challenges in new ways and by utilizing America's innovation.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;{{cite web|title=21st Century Statecraft|url=https://www.state.gov/statecraft/overview/index.htm|publisher=The Office of Electronic Information, Bureau of Public Affairs|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber-Diplomacy as identified by the United States Department of State, “encompasses a wide range of U.S. interests in cyberspace.  These include not only cyber security and [[Internet censorship|Internet freedom]], but also Internet governance, military uses of the Internet, innovation and economic growth.  Cyberspace has also become a foreign policy issue in multilateral fora, in our bilateral relationships, and in our relationships with industry and civil society.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Cyber Diplomacy: Promoting Openness, Security and Prosperity in a Networked World|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/pl/168689.htm|publisher=The Office of Electronic Information, Bureau of Public Affairs|accessdate=2 April 2012|date=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State Department: 21st century statecraft==
Cyber-diplomacy was embraced by the United States Department of State in the commencement of 21st century statecraft, utilizing [[YouTube]], multimedia and social media to reach publics, in 2009.&lt;ref name="psa"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hallams|first=Ellen|title=DIGITAL DIPLOMACY:  THE INTERNET, THE BATTLE FOR IDEAS &amp; US FOREIGN POLICY|url=http://www.psa.ac.uk/journals/pdf/5/2010/347_874.pdf|publisher=Political Studies Association Annual Conference|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Department of State's official explanation of it is, “The complementing of traditional foreign policy tools with newly innovated and adapted instruments of statecraft that fully leverages the networks, technologies, and demographics of our interconnected world.”&lt;ref name="state" /&gt; “The First [[Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review]] of 2010”, explains 21st century diplomacy as the United States’ adaptation to an increasingly varied set of actors who influence national debates, such as an increasing amount of states capable of acting on their own diplomatic agendas, corporations, transnational networks, foundations, NGOs, religious groups and citizens themselves. The incentive to create and embrace U.S. cyber-diplomacy and 21st century statecraft is to connect the private and civic sectors with U.S.  foreign policy efforts by utilizing new resources; connection technologies and expanding, facilitating, and streamlining our public-private partnership process.&lt;ref name="state_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/153142.pdf|publisher=The United States Department of State|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] explained the concept as "We're working to leverage the power and potential in what I call 21st century statecraft. Part of our approach is to embrace new tools, like using cell phones for mobile banking or to monitor elections. But we're also reaching to the people behind these tools, the innovators and entrepreneurs themselves."&lt;ref name="state" /&gt; The efforts by the U.S. Department of State in cyber-diplomacy has led the State Department to currently have 230 [[Facebook]]  pages, 80 [[Twitter]] accounts, 55 channels on [[YouTube]] and 40 accounts on [[Flickr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chernenko|first=Yelena|title=Russian paper sees USA's "digital diplomacy" as meddling in internal affairs|newspaper=BBC Worldwide Monitoring|date=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department has also founded many cyber-diplomacy programs and initiatives.  Some of these programs are [[Dipnote]], Digital Outreach Team, [[Opinion Space]], [[Democracy Dialogues]] and Civil Society 2.0.

===21st century statecraft leadership: the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs===
[[File:Tara D. Sonenshine US State Dept photo.jpg|thumb|The Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Tara D. Sonenshine.]]
U.S. public diplomacy is led by the [[Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs]], currently Tara D. Sonenshine.  Sonenshine assumed the position of Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs on April 5, 2012. The duty and responsibility of the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs is to "lead America's public diplomacy outreach, which includes communications with international audiences, cultural programming, academic grants, educational exchanges, international visitor programs, and U.S. government efforts to confront ideological support for terrorism." The Under Secretary also manages the [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]], Public Affairs, the [[Bureau of International Information Programs]], and participates in foreign policy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs|url=https://www.state.gov/r/|publisher=The Office of Electronic Information, Bureau of Public Affairs|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and initiatives==

===DipNote===
[[DipNote]] was created in 2007 and opened a platform for the U.S. State Department to engage foreign publics through blogs.  It encourages open conversation in regards to the United States and public diplomacy.  Part of the philosophy of DipNote is to accept negative and positive feedback from participants and in doing so assess the temperature of foreign publics.  DipNote was reformed in 2009 with the launch of 21st Century Statecraft by the State Department.  This expanded the role and platform of engagement by DipNote personnel.  One of the new purposes of DipNote is to inform people about the travels, speeches, and efforts of Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], State Department employees and diplomats around the world. Another new purpose of DipNote is the establishment of communication, creation of narrative and the translation of President Obama's speeches.  DipNote has expanded its dissemination of information to include translations of President Obama's speeches, into different languages and then share the president's speeches through several [[Twitter]] accounts.  The goal is to make America's public diplomacy more accessible to people who do not speak English and receive their information through the internet.&lt;ref name="psa" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graffy|first=Colleen|title=The Rise of Public Diplomacy 2.0|journal=The Journal of International Security Affairs|year=2009|volume=17|url=http://www.securityaffairs.org/issues/2009/17/graffy.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Socmed - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|Social Media Platforms.]]

====President Obama's Cairo speech====
[[File:Khalil Gibran.jpg|thumb|upright=.56|alt=Khalil Gibran.|Gibran Khalil Gibran.]]
One of the undertakings by the Digital Outreach Team occurred on June 4, 2009, when President [[Barack Obama]] gave a speech addressing the Muslim world, from [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].  President Obama's speech was an attempt to foster change in the perception of the United States.  His speech discussed the new beginnings and relations between the West and the [[Middle East]].  Between June and December in 2009, the DOT opened thirty discussion threads on nineteen Arab and Russian centered websites, where the primary conversation was Obama's Cairo speech.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite web|last=Khatib|first=Lina|title=Public Diplomacy 2.0:  An Exploratory Case Study of the US Digital Outreach Team|url=http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/23084/No.120-_Public_Diplomacy_2.0.pdf|publisher=Center on Democracy, Development, and The Rule of Law Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies Stanford University and later published in The Middle East Journal in 2012|accessdate=1 April 2012|author2=William Dutton |author3=Michael Thelwall |date=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====American narrative====
Another example of a DOT initiative is the narrative of [[Gibran Kahlil Gibran]].  One of the DOT members followed the life and work of Gibran Kahlil Gibran, a Lebanese-American poet and artist.  This project creates a narrative of an American who is of Middle Eastern descent and his life within the United States.  Former Under Secretary of State, [[Charlotte Beers]], stated,  the use of “virtual reality to see a small town in America, to have an interview, to listen to someone recite the Declaration of Independence…that’s the goal,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Liam|author2=Scott Lucas |title=Public Diplomacy and U.S. Foreign Policy|journal=American Quarterly|pages=322|url=http://www.americanquarterly.org/interact/documents/57.2kennedy.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of creating an American narrative.  The hope is that exporting the American narrative, such as the one of Mr. Gibran's, makes American values and ideals tangible.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

===Opinion Space===
[[File:Opinion Space.jpg|thumb|Opinion Space 3.0]]
[[Opinion Space]] is a website created by the United States Department of State and the [[University of California]] at [[Berkeley Center for New Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of State Launches New Tool to Foster Online Open Dialogue|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2010/03/138326.htm|publisher=The Office of Electronic Information, Bureau of Public Affairs|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows people to express and register their views on a number of topics, from politics to economics.  When participants register their view, they are informed where they stand on a particular issue, relative to the other participants.&lt;ref name="state_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; On February 15, 2011, Opinion Space 3.0 was launched by the U.S. Department of State.  Opinion Space 3.0 uses a gaming program that incorporates methods from  polling, collaborative filtering and multidimensional visualization. The program then organizes the information and displays the feedback in patterns and trends as they develop. It invites anyone from around the world to participate in discussion and evaluate the responses of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dowd|first=Katie|title=Opinion Space 3.0 Launches on State.Gov|url=http://blogs.state.gov/index.php/site/entry/opinion_space_30|accessdate=March 28, 2012|date=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democracy Dialogues===
Democracy Dialogues is a multilingual interactive website established by the U.S. Department of State in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waller|first=Michael|title=The Public Diplomacy Reader|year=2009|publisher=J Michael Waller|isbn=9780615154657|pages=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a platform to encourage shared discussion about democratic principles with people outside of the United States. The web based discussion focuses on the principles of democracy and every two months a new democratic theme is featured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. National Strategy for   Public Diplomacy and Strategic  Communication|url=http://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/pdfs/stratcommo_plan_070531.pdf|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual Student Foreign Service===
[[File:VSFS.jpg|thumb|Virtual Student Foreign Service.]]
The [[Virtual Student Foreign Service]] was launched in 2009 by Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]]. Virtual Student Foreign Service partners American students with our global diplomatic missions, to conduct outreach online while harnessing the knowledge of U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name="state_a" /&gt; Responsibilities of the selected students for the Virtual Student Foreign Service are:
*Develop and implement a public relations campaign using social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, YouTube, etc. to communicate and reach out to youth
*Conduct research on the economic situation, prepare graphic representations of economic data, and prepare informational material for the U.S. Embassy website
*Create a system to gather and analyze media coverage on a set of topics including environment, health, and trade
*Research IT-based interventions that have been successful in higher education, particularly in teacher training
*Write and contribute biweekly articles to the U.S. Embassy's Facebook page on topics such as internet, computer science/technology, history, and literature
*Develop a series of professional instructional video clips to be published by the U.S. Embassy
*Survey social media efforts of U.S. diplomatic posts, NGOs, and private companies around the world to help establish best practices in a U.S. Embassy's social media outreach business plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual Student Foreign Service|url=https://www.state.gov/vsfs/|publisher=State Department|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil Society 2.0===

Civil Society 2.0 is connecting the information and communications technology community with civil society organizations around the world and   provides civil society organizations with access to the latest technologies.&lt;ref name="state_a" /&gt; According to the U.S. Department of State, it is a program that supports civil society efforts worldwide because civil society helps to make communities more prosperous and stable.  Civil Society 2.0 uses text messages, websites, and social media platforms to connect the numerous participants.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt; The State Department sends technologists to specific regions so they can teach the local population how to use technology and therefore establish a technological society.  The technologists will specifically educate the people on:[[File:Civil Society 20.jpg|thumb|Civil Society 2.0]]
*How to build a website
*How to blog
*How to launch a text messaging campaign
*How to build an online community
*How to leverage social networks for a cause&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secretary Clinton Announces Civil Society 2.0 Initiative to Build Capacity of Grassroots Organizations|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2009/nov/131234.htm|publisher=State Department|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual Presence Post (VPP)===
[[Virtual Presence Post]] is a tool which helps a U.S. Embassy's Principal Officer utilize available diplomatic outreach instruments.  VPPs are usually composed of one or two officers that manage an internet site explaining U.S. policy, providing updates and news on U.S. relations with the host country and are accessible for dialogue.  The communication of the VPP includes topics such as, travel, programs, media, and technology, in an effort to improve U.S. engagement with specific communities where the U.S. has no physical diplomatic facilities.  Currently, there are 43 active VPPs around the world, some of them are in Zhengzhou, China, Chittagong, Bangladesh, the Seychelles, San Marino, Somalia, and Gaza.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nakamura|first=Kennon|title=Diplomacy for the 21st Century: Transformational Diplomacy|date= August 23, 2007 |url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL34141.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=March 28, 2012|author2=Susan B. Epstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Life Games===

The [[X-Life Games]] was launched in June 2008.  The Games were developed by MetroStar Systems along with [[Neal Hallford]], [[J.R. Register]], and  [[Ghafur Remtulla]] and funded by the [[U.S. Department of State]].&lt;ref name="bare_url_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch of X-Life Games Heralds New Era for U.S. Diplomacy|url=http://xlifegames.com/news/details.aspx?ID=5|publisher=MetroStar Systems, Inc|accessdate=1 April 2012|date=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; X-Life Games is an English-based mobile game that fosters cultural exchange between Arabic, Persian, and English speaking cultures with a focus upon the current technological savvy generation. The expectation of the mobile game is to "portray American culture and convey fundamental values that are present in American culture, such as; [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Liberty|freedom]], and the respect for cultural and religious differences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dale|first=Helle|title=Public Diplomacy 2.0:Where the U.S. Government Meets "New Media"|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/54925083/Public-Diplomacy-2-0-Where-the-U-S-Government-Meets-%E2%80%9CNew-Media%E2%80%9D|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=2 April 2012|date=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch of [[X-Life Games]] is to encourage cultural bridging, while decaying barriers that impede mutual understanding, through a video game.  Cultural bridging embodied in a video game reaches across all generations, especially the current one being raised in an ever sophisticated and technological world. In participating, the users begin by choosing an X-Life character.  They then learn and use skills acquired through everyday experiences.   Each phase of the game allows the user to apply those skills to improve themselves and their world.  [[Ali Reza Manouchehri]], Chief Executive Officer of MetroStar Systems, discussing this video-game, stated the “Middle East and the Persian Gulf youth will have the opportunity to experience the dynamism and vitality of American life. X-Life projects the fundamental values that Americans cherish: tolerance, freedom, and respect for cultural and religious differences.” &lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt;

== History ==
In 2006, Visual Collaborative was founded by multidisciplinary designer and technologist [[Ade A. Olufeko|Ade Abayomi Olufeko]], to bridge the gap between creative professionals and their commercial value.&lt;ref name="vanity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="voa"&gt;{{cite episode | |title=A technologist, Visual Collaborative |series=Africa 54 |date=18 December 2015 |network=[[Voice of America|Voice Of America (VOA)]] |season=|number=|last= Makori |first=Vincent (host)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since originating in [[Minneapolis]], Visual Collaborative has showcased [[Collection_(artwork)|collections]] and talks in Minneapolis, Miami, New York City, [[Mission_District,_San_Francisco|''The Mission'']] San Francisco California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fashionschooldaily.com/index.php/2011/10/20/wonderland-sf-gallerys-new-exhibit-white-monochrome-and-color/| title=Black White Monochrome and Color  | publisher=FSD Academy  | date=Oct 21, 2011 | accessdate=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Columbia,_Maryland|Columbia]] Maryland, and Washington D.C.&lt;ref name="ada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africandigitalart.com/2011/12/event-visual-grandeur-a-visual-collaborative-exhibition/ |title=Visual Grandeur, A Visual Collaborative Exhibition |publisher=African Digital Art |date=December 18, 2011 |accessdate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the group's inaugural event featured international artists '''Miko Simmons''' and '''Linda Zacks''', took place at the original Center for Independent Artists, inside ''Instituto de Cultura y Educacion'' located in a community of [[Powderhorn Park, Minneapolis|South Minneapolis]]. In 2011, in Washington D.C., Visual Collaborative produced an exhibition featuring emerging and established artists with a collection described as vibrant new art.&lt;ref name="ada"/&gt;  In 2015, the platform collaborated with the Arts District Hyattsville Master Association in Hyattsville, utilizing ''the Lustine Center'' to host a group exhibition themed Vanity.&lt;ref name="ngrland"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/10/visual-collaborative-redefining-the-essence-of-arts/ | title=Visual Collaborative Redefining the essence of arts| publisher=[[The Guardian (Nigeria)|The Guardian Nigeria]] | date=October 8, 2015 | accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application of Xenelasia laws==
===In Lacedæmonia===
''Xenelasia'' is most famously associated with Sparta. Lacedæmonian magistrates had the authorization to expel any person who posed a threat to public order and morals, for they considered their [[Family as a model for the state|state a family writ large]]. While foreigners were allowed in for religious festivals and missions of state, they were generally not permitted to live in the environs, though special exceptions might be given to friends and allies, ([[laconophile]]s) like [[Xenophon]]. [[Xenophon]] himself wrote about ''xenelasia'' in his ''Constitution of the Spartans:''   &lt;blockquote&gt;"There were alien acts in former days, and to live abroad was illegal; and I have no doubt that the purpose of these regulations was to keep the citizens from being demoralized by contact with foreigners; and now I have no doubt that the fixed ambition of those who are thought to be first among them is to live to their dying day as governors in a foreign land."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg010.perseus-eng1:14.4|title=Xenophon, Constitution of the Lacedaimonians, chapter 14, section 4|last=|first=|date=|website=data.perseus.org|others=Translated by E.C. Marchant &amp; G.W. Bowersock|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Thucydides]] wrote a speech attributed to [[Pericles]] in his ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', which portrays ''xenelasia'' as a characteristic of Athens' enemies during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. These opponents included the Lacedæmonians:   &lt;blockquote&gt;"If we turn to our military policy, there also we differ from antagonists. We throw open our city to the world, and never by alien acts (ξενηλασίαις / ''xenelasiais)'' exclude foreigners from any opportunity of learning or observing, although the eyes of an enemy may occasionally profit by our liberality; trusting less in system and policy than to the native spirit of our citizens..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-eng3:2.39.1|title=Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, Book 2, chapter 39, section 1|last=|first=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|publisher=London, J. M. Dent; New York, E. P. Dutton. 1910.|others=Translated by Richard Crawley|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Concerning ''xenelasia'' in Lacedæmonia, [[Plutarch]] wrote: {{Quote|text="And this was the reason why he ([[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]) forbade them to travel abroad, and go about acquainting themselves with foreign rules of morality, the habits of ill-educated people, and different views of government. Withal he banished from Lacedaemon all strangers who would not give a very good reason for their coming thither; not because he was afraid lest they should inform themselves of and imitate his manner of government (as [[Thucydides]] says), or learn anything to their good; but rather lest they should introduce something contrary to good manners. With strange people, strange words must be admitted; these novelties produce novelties in thought; and on these views and feelings whose discordant character destroys the harmony of the state. He was as careful to save his city from the infection of foreign bad habits, as men usually are to prevent the introduction of a pestilence."&lt;ref&gt;''Plutarch: The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans'', trans. by [[John Dryden]] and revised by [[Arthur Hugh Clough]], The Modern Library (div of Random House, Inc). Bio on Lycurgus, pg 70.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Prof. [[Karl Otfried Müller]] writes that the Doric ideal of a "certain loftiness and severity of character" was preserved in Sparta only because it succeeded in keeping herself in an isolated situation. He argues these laws were intended to preserve the native character of the Doric tribe from any taint of foreign influence.{{ref|a}} However, Müller wrote in the context of a racial, mythographic view of history - they were the invading and occupying force in Lacedæmonia, holding down a population of servile peasants, called [[Helots]], by iron military rule, and so, themselves, in the strict sense, ''[[Xenos (Greek)|xenoi]]''. 

[[Niccolò Machiavelli]] believed that Sparta lasted a long time because "she did not permit strangers to establish themselves in the republic" and remarked that the [[Roman Republic]] took the opposite course of Sparta spelling her doom.&lt;ref&gt;''The Prince'', Niccolò Machiavelli, trans. &amp; ed. by [[Robert McCormick Adams, Jr.|Robert M. Adams]], W.W. Norton &amp; Co., NY, 1992. pg 96 [http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch11s1.html Machiavelli Balanced Government]&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be noted, however, that the population of Sparta was in irreversible decline from the time of its victory in the Peloponnesian Wars, falling from 9,000 Spartiates in 640 to 1,000 after the battle of Leucra in 371, due to the refusal of miscegenation, selective infanticide and the desertion of patrician scions to more attractive foreign parts. The Roman polis, in addition, is the one society in the ancient world which most modeled itself on the Spartan military ethos. {{Citation needed|reason=This is an abrupt change of topic and is debatable. While Roman society may have been militaristic and, to that extent, understandably reminiscent of the Spartan ethos, there were substantial differences in both the basic social structure and the nature of their political expansion. |date=March 2017}}

===In Doric Crete===
In Plato's ''Laws'', Clinias the Cretan remarks on [[Homer]] that "…we Cretans are not much given to cultivating verse of alien origin."&lt;ref&gt;''The Collected Dialogues of Plato'', edited by [[Edith Hamilton]] and Huntington Cairns, Bollingen Series LXXI, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 1961. ''The Laws'', §680c; pg 1275.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Doric Corcyreans were active, industrious and enterprising, good sailors and active merchants, they had entirely lost the stability and noble features of the Doric character. Some said that they exceeded the Athenians in degradation and that even their dogs excelled in impudence.&lt;ref&gt;''The History and Antiquities of the Doric Race'', Karl Otfried Müller, 2nd ed. rev. 1839. Vol II, pg 157.&lt;/ref&gt;
Argos was also a Doric state. It also lost its "noble features of the Doric character". "Argos became such an unsettled state of public affairs, sycophancy and violence became prevalent:…"&lt;ref&gt;''The History and Antiquities of the Doric Race'', Karl Otfried Müller, 2nd ed. rev. 1839. Vol II, pg 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taranto|Tarentum]] was also a Doric state, a colony in [[Magna Graecia]]. "At a subsequent period, however, as there was no longer men of this stamp (noble character) to carry on the government, and the corruption of manners, caused by the natural fruitfulness of the country, and restrained by no strict laws, was continually on the increase, the state of Tarentum was so entirely changed, that every trace of the ancient Doric character, and particularly of the mother-country, disappeared; hence, although externally powerful and wealthy, it was from its real internal debility, in the end, necessarily overthrown, particularly when the insolent violence of the people became a fresh source of weakness."&lt;ref&gt;''The History and Antiquities of the Doric Race'', Karl Otfried Müller, 2nd ed. rev. 1839. Vol II, pg 183&lt;/ref&gt;

The brief admiration the Athenians and their allies may have had for Spartan Doric discipline and virtue born of cultural isolation, must be viewed in the context of their early alliance against the Persians, later to be turned to hatred and rebellion in the outcome of the Pelopennesian War and their loss of democracy and autonomy. But well before events turned the other city states against the dominant Sparta, Plato deploys the term Xenelasia as synonymous with barbarity, an entirely uncivilised condition. He has this to say in the [[Laws]] [XII, 950a-b]: "Not to welcome any visitor and never to go out [of your homeland] is, besides, something quite impossible and would, at the same time, be seen in the eyes of other men as a savage and unsocial form of behaviour. It would bring upon you the odious name of someone who hunts down foreigners (xenolasiais) and would earn you the reputation of having rough and brutal manners". op cit.

== Notes ==
*{{note|a}}"The anxiety of the Dorians, and the Spartans in particular, to keep up the pure Doric character and the customs of their ancestors, is strongly shown by the prohibition to travel, and the exclusion of foreigners, an institution common both to Spartans and Cretans,…"&lt;ref&gt;''The History and Antiquities of the Doric Race'', [[Karl Otfried Müller]], trans. from the German by [[Henry Tufnell]] and [[George Cornewall Lewis]], John Murray, London, 2nd ed. rev. 1839. Vol II, pg 4&lt;/ref&gt;
